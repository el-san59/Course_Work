The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis. The tumor and the hematoma were removed. The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given. Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint.\r"

During the first day of the first course he also received 5 X 10E9 lymphokine-activated killer cells intraventricularly. This gave rise to a severe elevation of intracranial pressure, with headaches and meningismus. During the second course no LAK cells were administered. This course was tolerated much better. The neurological status did not change during the treatment. Recombinant interleukin-2 levels were maintained at about 300 U/mL during both courses.\r"

  ".W": "The inactivation of viruses added to whole blood and a red cell concentrate with aluminum phthalocyanine and its sulfonated derivatives was studied. A cell-free form of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), used as a model, was completely inactivated (greater than 10(4) infectious units; TCID50) on treatment of whole blood with 10 microM (10 mumol/L) aluminum phthalocyanine chloride (AIPs) and visible light dosage of 88 to 176 J per cm2. At 44 J per cm2, complete VSV inactivation was achieved on raising the concentration of AIPc to 25 microM (25 mumol/L). Results at least as good were achieved on similar treatment of a red cell concentrate. Also inactivated were a cell-associated form of VSV and both cell-free and cell-associated forms of human immunodeficiency virus; encephalomyocarditis virus, used as a model for non-lipid-enveloped viruses, was not inactivated by this procedure. This inactivation of cell-free VSV suggests that a similar degree of inactivation could be achieved with a lower concentration of the sulfonated forms of aluminum phthalocyanine. Throughout the above studies, red cell integrity was well maintained, as judged by the absence of hemoglobin release (less than or equal to 2%) during the course of treatment or on subsequent storage. Red cell osmotic fragility was decreased on treatment of whole blood with AIPc. This study indicates that AIPc may be a promising method for the inactivation of viruses in cellular blood products.\r"

  ".W": "Blood samples from 2000 accepted blood donors and 343 deferred donors with antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation were evaluated for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Sixteen (0.8%) of the 2000 sera initially reacted on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); 12 (0.6%) were repeatably reactive. One repeatably reactive sample had an elevated ALT; two reacted on anti-HBc testing and had ALT elevations. When the repeatably reactive ELISA samples were tested by an immunoblot assay, four reacted, three were indeterminate, and five did not react. Among the 343 deferred donors, HCV antibodies were detected in 8 (3.8%) of 210 anti-HBc-reactive samples, 12 (11.8%) of 104 elevated-ALT samples, and 15 (52%) of 29 combined elevated-ALT and anti-HBc-reactive samples; 25 of 28 reacted on immunoblot. The anti-HBc-reactive sera were subdivided into groups according to strength of anti-HBc reactivity (weak or strong) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen status and then were compared for anti-HCV reactivity rates. The group of samples showing the greatest frequency of anti-HCV had strong anti-HBc reactivity. For blood donors, the anti-HCV test correlates with the surrogate tests for non-A, non-B hepatitis (anti-HBc and ALT); however, most anti-HCV-reactive units remain undetected by surrogate tests, so that implementation of anti-HCV screening should further reduce the transmission of HCV via transfusion.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of transfusion on the incidence of postoperative infection, a retrospective cohort study of 196 patients who underwent surgery for gastric carcinoma in the period from 1985 through 1989 was carried out. Seventy-one patients (36.2%) developed postoperative septic complications; they had received an average of 4.2 blood units, as compared with 2.7 units received by patients not affected (p less than 0.0053). The hypothesis of dose-response relationship is supported by the Mantel-Haenszel test, as applied to the overall results (p less than 0.01) and the results grouped by duration of operation (p less than 0.02). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis shows transfusion to be an independent risk factor in the incidence of infection (p less than 0.01), as are antibiotic prophylaxis (p less than 0.015), urinary tract catheterization (p less than 0.002), and the duration of surgery (p less than 0.027). This significance is attained after adjustment for age, gender, period of evolution of symptoms; preoperative infection(s), number of white cells, hemoglobin level and total proteins on diagnosis, location of tumor, tumor, nodes, and metastasis staging, operative technique, drainage of the area of operation, enteral nutrition, and the histologic studies and macroscopic appearance of the tumor. This study is further evidence that transfusion may cause an increased incidence of postoperative infection.\r"

Male ABDs had a higher rate of return as HBDs, as 34 percent (21/62) returned to donate an average of 3 units, whereas 13 percent (56/427) of female ABDs returned as HBDs to donate an average of 2 units. Although a history of donation was associated with a higher rate of return (30%, 34/113), 11 percent (43/376) of ABDs with no history as HBDs returned to donate homologous units, despite having been recruited less frequently than prior HBDs. Overall, all male ABDs and female ABDs with an HBD history returned most frequently. The extra effort required for an autologous donor program may result in the recruitment of new donors into the HBD pool.\r"

The device contained terpolymer hydrogel-coated plates with chemically attached, aggregated human immunoglobulin G, and it operated as an immunoaffinity column. Sixty-one patients aged 25 to 73 underwent weekly plasmapheresis treatments (the primary therapy phase). During the trial, patients continued current rheumatoid arthritis medications without dose adjustments. All patients received two to six treatments (primary therapy). Responding patients were eligible to continue apheresis treatment every 2 to 6 weeks (maintenance therapy). No serious, untoward side effects were noted in the course of this study; of 640 treatments, only 2 (in different patients) were aborted, one because of complaints of dizziness and angioedema and the other because of chest tightness and shortness of breath. Except for a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in serum iron, no significant changes in complete blood count, serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function tests, or serum C3 and C4 were noted. Although the trial was not designed to determine clinical efficacy, patients noted less morning stiffness, longer time to onset of fatigue, and improved global pain assessment (p less than 0.004); significant objective improvements were noted in joint pain, tenderness, swelling, and the number of affected joints (p less than 0.001). One-half of the treated patients had at least a 50 percent improvement in objective measures of antirheumatic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Many blood centers have recruited HLA-typed apheresis blood donors into marrow donor registries. However, to build larger registries so that more patients may be treated with unrelated donor marrow transplants, whole blood donors and people who do not donate blood have been added to the registries. The marrow donor program at our blood center had 2844 potential donors, of whom 1725 were also apheresis donors, 608 were whole blood donors, and 511 were recruited from the general public as a result of community appeals for marrow donors for a specific patient. Over a 9-month period, 297 potential donors were asked to donate blood samples for HLA-DR typing or mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) testing or to participate in an informational session, undergo a medical evaluation, and sign a statement indicating an intention to donate marrow for a specific patient. Overall, these requests were successfully completed by 75.5 percent of apheresis donors, 87.2 percent of whole blood donors, and 78.1 percent of the potential donors recruited through community appeals. Furthermore, there was no difference among the three groups in the portion of people who donated blood samples for HLA-DR typing or MLC testing. Fifteen of 18 apheresis donors who were found to match a specific donor signed a statement of intent to donate marrow, 2 apheresis donors were deferred for medical reasons, and 1 decided not to donate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their specificities were determined by inhibitions using Tn sialoglycoproteins (SGPs), mucins (armadillo [ASG] and ovine [OSG] submaxillary glycoproteins), and monosaccharides. BRIC 66 agglutinated both Tn and group A RBCs and reacted immunohistochemically with both the vascular endothelium and tumor cells from a group A adenocarcinoma, BRIC 66 was inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), Tn SGPs, and mucins on both hemagglutination inhibition tests and radioimmunoassay. BRIC 111 agglutinated Tn RBCs only, and it specifically stained tumor cells from a group O patient's breast carcinoma and a group A patient's adenocarcinoma. In hemagglutination inhibition tests, BRIC 111 was readily inhibited by Tn SGPs, only partially inhibited by GalNAc, and not inhibited by mucins. In a sensitive radioimmunoassay, BRIC 111 was inhibitable by GalNAc. Tn SGP was 2000-fold more effective as an inhibitor than the mucins (ASG and desialized OSG), which contain a high content of terminal alpha-GalNAc-O-serine (threonine) residues. It is postulated that BRIC 66 is specific for terminal alpha-GalNAc units in carbohydrate chains. The exclusive reaction of BRIC 111 with Tn SGP indicates a combining site larger than GalNAc alpha-1, which probably includes amino acid residues in juxtaposition to GalNAc in Tn SGP. In view of its specific agglutination of Tn RBCs, BRIC 111 is a useful reagent for the examination of polyagglutinable RBCs.\r"

Both techniques rely on the method of harvesting WBCs from a 300- to 350-mL unit of RBCs and concentrating them to a volume of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 mL, which is equivalent to a WBC concentration of approximately 550 to 1. The WBC separation and concentration steps require less than 3 hours to complete, and multiple RBC units can be processed in parallel. Cell counting is carried out in a fluorescence hemocytometer or by a modified cytospin technique. As few as 1000 WBCs in a unit of RBCs, which corresponds to a more than 6 log10 WBC depletion, can be measured without reaching the sensitivity limit of either technique (800 and 200 WBC/unit, respectively). The harvesting method and counting techniques are relatively simple and inexpensive.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis model to detect and quantify white cells (WBCs) in red cell concentrates (RBCC) drawn from units of blood that are highly depleted of WBCs is described. WBC detection is performed by fluorescence analysis of 50 microL of RBCC labeled with propidium iodide, a DNA/RNA fluorophore. Quantification is performed by regression analysis of standard dilutions of RBCC in substantially WBC-free red cells. This RBCC diluent is obtained by filtration of blood through a new medium. The method proves to be precise (CV = 7%), efficient (+/- 30 min/aliquot), and linear (r = 0.99) to 6 log10 WBC depletion of the native product. The current technique is preferable to those suggested previously, such as ficoll concentration, which requires the sacrifice of the unit of blood for counting purposes, and to earlier fluorescence analysis techniques that do not employ WBC-free red cell diluents. The latter do not monitor extremely low concentrations of WBCs because they lack adequate signal-to-noise discrimination. The sensitivity of the described method allows for monitoring of WBC depletion procedures with greater efficiency than is currently available commercially.\r"

Although transfused frozen platelets have an acceptable life span in vivo, functional defects have been found when these cells were tested in vitro. The adhesive properties of frozen platelets were investigated by use of a modified Baumgartner chamber to perform paired perfusion studies of fresh versus frozen platelets or fresh versus 5-day-stored platelets from the same whole blood unit. Platelets were either frozen in liquid nitrogen with dimethyl sulfoxide as the cryopreservative or stored under standard blood bank conditions for 5 days. The freeze-thaw recovery of platelets was 73 +/- 8 percent. Frozen platelets exhibited a significant decrease in platelet adhesion as compared to fresh platelets from the same unit; adhesion of frozen platelets was only 53 percent of that of fresh platelets (p = 0.04). A slight, but insignificant decrease was noted with platelets stored for 5 days (86%, p = 0.197). These findings indicate that frozen-thawed platelets have a significant defect in adhesive capacity as compared to fresh platelets, and that platelets stored under blood bank conditions for 5 days maintain adhesive capacity well.\r"

There was no increased bleeding in patients with mild to moderate coagulopathy (defined as PT or PTT up to twice the midpoint normal range or pit count of 50 to 99 x 10(3) per microL [50-99 x 10(9)/L]). However, patients with markedly elevated serum creatinine levels (6.0 to 14.0 mg/dL [530-1240 mumol/L]) had a significantly greater average hemoglobin loss (-0.82 +/- 1.3 g/dL [-8 +/- 13 g/L], n = 11) than patients with normal serum creatinine levels (-0.12 +/- 0.88 g/dL [-1 +/- 9 g/L], n = 450) (p = 0.011). Overall, the frequency of bleeding complications requiring red cell transfusions was very low: 0.2 percent of events. The most common diagnosis for patients who had paracentesis was alcoholic liver disease (72%); for those having thoracentesis, it was infection (37%). It can be concluded that, for these patients, prophylactic plasma or platelet transfusions are not necessary. Patients with markedly elevated serum creatinine deserve close postprocedure observation.\r"

The sample consists of 72 male patients seen at a university-based family practice clinic located in a small rural community in Michigan. Patient age and physician gender preference were the main independent variables of interest. This study found that 51.5% of all male patients in the sample indicated a preference for a male physician to perform the genital exam while 48.5% indicated no preference for physician gender. In contrast, for the rectal exam, 61.5% of all male patients indicated no preference for physician gender while 38.5% did express a preference for a male physician. No one expressed a preference for a female physician for either the genital or rectal exams. Further analysis revealed that male patients over the age of 40 who prefer a male physician do so, at least in part, because it would be embarrassing to have a female physician perform the exam. Few, however, would refuse to allow a female physician to perform the exam. Respondents preferred certain positions for the exam and these are a means of minimizing potential embarrassment in the older patient.\r"

Twenty-nine (90.6%) of the FP authors thus identified responded to a questionnaire soliciting the article's publication history. Of the 29, only one author had initially submitted his article to a family medicine journal. The most common reason cited by the other authors for not submitting to a family medicine journal was a perception that the non-family medicine journals had wider readership and prestige than family medicine journals. Other authors indicated that institutional promotion and tenure committees give less weight to publications in family medicine journals and, therefore, these authors felt it was preferable to publish in non-family medicine journals.\r"

These patients were then given a knowledge test and questioned about the factors that led to their decision about the test. Fourteen of the 45 study patients (31%) elected to have MSAFP testing. The patient's decision to have MSAFP testing was found to be significantly associated with 1) reporting a longer length of time discussing the test with the physician, 2) reporting that the opinion of a significant other about the test was important, and 3) older age. There is a need for further study of patients' acceptance of MSAFP testing to see if the relatively low acceptance rate found in this study is also found in other practices.\r"

Although most respondents desired the physician to raise the topics of reproductive biology (62%), health history (62%), and the sexual relationship (53%), one-third of the subjects also sought counsel on interpersonal relations and childrearing issues. Most subjects in this latter group left the premarital exam with their relationship and childrearing questions unanswered. Female patients were more likely than male patients to have their questions or concerns addressed, raising the question of a selective gender bias. These findings indicate that physicians should offer counsel on most topics without waiting for the patient to ask, allowing patients to turn down unwanted help, rather than having to ask for information in sensitive areas.\r"

  ".W": "This study explores a possible association between the propensity of primary care physicians to record referrals on special referral forms and the source/mechanism of payment for services. Using a randomly selected sample of visits to University faculty family physicians over a 12-month period, referrals were identified from three sources: progress notes, a special form that was included in the patient's chart, and a computerized list that was generated from the special referral form. A notation in one or more of these sources constituted a referral. Using all three sources, the referral rates were 13.8 referrals per 100 patient encounters for Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) patients, compared with 14.1 for Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) patients and 10.4 for patients with other insurance (p = .83). The progress note in the patient chart was the best source for determining whether a referral had been requested, with approximately 85% documentation. Special forms were not likely to be completed for referrals, especially for non-HMO patients (less than 30% documentation). Thus, reliance on a special form for documentation of referrals would have led to the erroneous conclusion of higher referral rates for HMO patients. The tendency of providers to be more complete in recording referrals of HMO patients (a recording bias) may account for the observed higher rate of referral of such patients in other studies.\r"

This paper presents a model of threats that can be applied to both types of designs to compare their scientific merits.\r"

The patients were very willing to record their home blood pressures for an extended period of time. The home blood pressure monitors were found to be quite accurate, and blood pressures measured at home were significantly lower than readings obtained in the office. In 39% (14 of 36) of the subjects studied, the average home blood pressures were more than 10 mmHg lower than their office readings. These findings support the hypothesis that home blood pressure monitoring can be useful in the management of borderline hypertensive patients.\r"

LGIE procedures in IM programs were more frequently supervised by gastroenterologists, and in FP programs they were more frequently supervised by FP faculty. Only 55 percent of FP and 56 percent of IM residents were predicted to suggest screening LGIE to their patients, and 80 percent of FP and 63 percent of IM residents were predicted to include sigmoidoscopy in the evaluation of hematochezia.\r"

Of 270 patients who responded to a questionnaire, 63-93 percent agreed that physicians should perform a wide variety of primary and secondary preventive medical services, such as periodic health examinations and counseling about smoking, exercise, and diet. Study physicians recommended most preventive medical services at least as often as did their patients, but physicians consistently underestimated patients' wishes for these services. Our results indicate that this rural clinic population is interested in a broad range of preventive medical services, which was not fully appreciated by the physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Less than 20 percent of elderly and other high-risk persons targeted for annual influenza vaccination are immunized each year. In most busy practice settings, it is difficult for primary care physicians to identify every patient in need of preventive health interventions. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of microcomputer-generated reminders on influenza vaccination rates in a university-based family practice center. The practice uses an interactive encounter form system from which updated clinical information is routinely entered into a cumulative database. During a 2-month period, 686 patients were identified in the database as eligible to receive influenza vaccine according to accepted criteria. Practice physicians (n = 32) were stratified by level of training and randomized to one of three groups, thereby receiving printed reminders on the encounter forms of all, none, or half of their eligible patients. Patients of physicians who always received reminders were more likely to receive influenza vaccine during the study period than patients of the never-reminded physicians (51 percent versus 30 percent, P less than 0.001). Patients whose physicians received reminders for only half their patients had an intermediate likelihood of receiving a vaccination if a reminder was printed (38 percent) but were less likely than the patients of never-reminded physicians to receive the vaccine if no reminder was printed (20 percent, P less than 0.001). This study suggests that physicians learn to depend on reminders for preventive health activities and that reminders are most effective when they are provided at every patient encounter.\r"

This report presents data showing the cost advantages to a small private clinic with faculty management compared with costs in a hospital-managed outpatient clinic; the savings were sufficient to assure continuation of the training program. Increased flexibility under faculty management provided a more realistic teaching environment and new research opportunities.\r"

Part I examines new spermicides and natural family planning. Current spermicides, though popular, are limited in number, have strict requirements for effective use, and cause a number of side effects. Investigational agents promise greater efficacy, simpler use, longer duration, and fewer adverse effects. Natural family planning methods are the only ones acceptable to a large number of couples, but they are seriously flawed by unacceptably low use-effectiveness and intensity of training requirements. Home chemical assays for biological markers of the fertile period, including urinary hormones and cervical enzymes, may improve the acceptability and effectiveness of natural family planning.\r"

Only 26 percent of respondents had returned two or more semen samples following surgery. Forty-five percent had not returned any samples. The inconvenience and embarrassment of having to bring semen specimens to the laboratory were identified as factors that can affect patient adherence to instructions. Respondents who had not returned any semen specimens were more likely to answer that their spouse would not be very upset if the vasectomy failed and pregnancy resulted. Our survey results identify issues for improving patient care following vasectomy. These include patient education and postoperative protocols.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical pharmacology of beta-adrenoceptor blockers is summarized. They have a variety of pharmacological actions on the beta-adrenoceptors. For example, propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker with antagonist effects on both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors, atenolol is a selective beta 1-antagonist, and celiprolol is a selective beta 1-antagonist, partial beta 2-agonist. beta 1-Receptor blockade tends to reduce heart rate, cardiac output, and arterial pressure while increasing peripheral vascular resistance, whereas beta 2-receptor blockade tends to be disadvantageous in causing bronchoconstriction and peripheral vasoconstriction. Selective beta 1-antagonist, beta 2-agonist activity would, therefore, appear to be particularly beneficial in offering the advantages of beta 1 blockade plus peripheral vasodilation. The beta 1- and beta 2-receptor actions of drugs are not always clearly identifiable, as in the demonstration of celiprolol's partial beta 2-agonist activity in human beings. This is because, in vivo, cardiovascular reflexes are intact and it has not, so far, been possible to remove endogenous catecholamines. This review summarizes various studies to investigate partial agonist activity, with particular emphasis on celiprolol.\r"

Hemodynamically, hypertension may be regarded as persistent elevation of arterial pressure associated with increased total peripheral resistance. In early or mild essential hypertension, however, increased total peripheral resistance may not readily be recognized because of the overriding effect of increased cardiac output. Clearly, the hemodynamics of blood pressure control are complex, and the mechanisms of antihypertensive agents must be used appropriately. The early beta-blockers reduced heart rate and cardiac output immediately after intravenous administration without immediately reducing arterial pressure, and calculated total peripheral resistance was increased. With prolonged oral treatment, arterial pressure decreased while maintaining a reduced heart rate and cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance, however, remained elevated. Recent beta-blockers, such as celiprolol, provide an improved physiologic response by instantly reducing arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance without reducing heart rate or cardiac output or expanding intravascular volume.\r"

In a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of celiprolol (a cardioselective beta 1-blocker with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory properties) in patients with hypertension and angina and in normal volunteers, it was found that celiprolol did not produce bradycardia when given in combination with verapamil. Celiprolol did reduce exercise-induced ischemia, but there was no reduction in cardiac output at rest or on exercise compared with placebo. Compared with atenolol, celiprolol produced less dyspnea and fatigue at submaximal levels of exercise. It is concluded that celiprolol possesses certain differences, compared with conventional beta-blockers, that may be of direct clinical benefit.\r"

Cardiovascular diseases are major causes of death and disability in the elderly; hence, identification of cardiovascular risk factors and effective treatment are essential. Evidence indicates that these risk factors in the elderly are similar to those in the young; namely, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, hyperfibrinogenemia, obesity, and cigarette smoking. The latter two relate to general patient management, whereas the remainder can be significantly influenced by modern drug therapy such as celiprolol. This drug is a third-generation highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory activity giving a unique and advantageous pharmacologic profile for antihypertensive therapy with particular benefits for the elderly. The impact of therapy with celiprolol on the cardiovascular risk factors in the elderly hypertensive patient is reviewed.\r"

The thiazides and loop diuretics increase total lipid levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. beta-Blockers without beta 2-agonist properties increase triglycerides and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and combined alpha/beta-blockers are generally thought to have little effect on the lipid profile, although some studies have indicated a modest beneficial effect. alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists are known to reduce LDL cholesterol levels modestly and to increase HDL cholesterol levels. The overall results of the currently available studies with celiprolol, a selective beta 1-antagonist with ancillary beta 2-agonist and vasodilating properties, indicate a favorable effect of the drug on serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles.\r"

In turn, these can reduce blood pressure, heart rate at rest, and blood lipid concentrations. Epidemiologic evidence shows that for every 1% change in serum cholesterol levels, there is a 3% change in the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease. In addition, a long-term (5-year) change of 5 to 6 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure can reduce the chances of stroke by 35 to 40% and of coronary heart disease by 20 to 25%. The full impact of this broad range of interventions on population health has still to be fully realized in many countries, including the United Kingdom, however it is likely to be considerable. Some of the recent evidence in support of such cardiovascular risk factor modification is selectively reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular hypertrophy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, and arteriolar hypertrophic changes are common in established hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy, in particular, markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. The ability of an antihypertensive agent to reverse hypertrophic changes could, therefore, be greatly advantageous. Clinical studies with beta-blockers have shown them able to substantially reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. For reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy, vasodilatory beta-blockers have been shown to be preferable to ordinary beta-blockers, possibly because vasodilation reduces vascular smooth-muscle tone, which may facilitate reversal of hypertrophy. Theoretically, a vasodilatory beta-blocker, such as celiprolol, would therefore appear to offer advantages because of its ability to reverse left ventricular and arteriolar hypertrophy in addition to its antihypertensive action. The practical and clinical effects of cardiovascular hypertrophy reversal remain to be fully evaluated; however, it is logical to assume that they would be of considerable benefit to the hypertensive patient.\r"

The major drawback of conventional measurement is that it cannot indicate the duration of drug effect or the influence of antihypertensive drugs on nocturnal blood pressure. Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement has a number of advantages over conventional measurement: it provides a profile of blood pressure over the 24-hour period; it detects white coat responders; it is free of regression to the mean and the placebo response, thereby making it possible to consider efficacy studies which need not have a placebo phase; it enables considerably more observations than is possible with clinic measurement by increasing the power of studies, which may reduce significantly the numbers of patients needed for antihypertensive drug studies. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement offers the opportunity to study antihypertensive drugs in fewer patients with greater accuracy than is possible with conventional clinic measurement and should be a mandatory requirement for such studies.\r"

The antigens were studied in the neoplastic C cells using immunohistochemistry with specific antisera and in the plasma using specific radioimmunoassay. Eighteen patients (8 male and 10 female patients, aged 12-72 years) were studied. Mean follow-up was 70.7 months (range, 2-179 months). Nine patients (50%) died of their disease after a mean follow-up of 47.2 months (range, 2-116 months). By immunostaining, primary tumors expressed CT and CEA in all cases and NSE was positive in 90%, CGRP in 66%, SRIF in 63%, and TG in 58%. Metastatic tissues were positive in all cases of CT staining, 92.8% of CEA, 71.4% of NSE, 73.3% of CGRP, 38.5% of SRIF, and only 13.3% of TG staining. In positive cases the percentage of positive cells and the degree of staining were variable among the different antigens. The expression of an antigen in the neoplastic cells was associated with the hypersecretion of the corresponding antigen in the circulation in the case of CT and CEA. The levels of these antigens were elevated in all patients with metastases and could accurately predict the appearance of new metastases or indicate the effective treatment of previous metastases by surgery. In the case of NSE, CGRP, and SRIF, few patients had increased plasma concentrations of the antigens and these usually occurred during very advanced phases of the disease. Detectable levels of serum TG were never observed. When the outcome of the disease was compared with the expression of CT, CEA, NSE, CGRP, and TG, no correlation could be found. On the contrary, SRIF expression in the primary tumor could differentiate two groups of patients with different survival rates. SRIF-positive patients had survival rates of 100% and 50% at five and seven years, respectively, whereas SRIF-negative patients had survival rates of 40% at five years and 25% at seven years.\r"

The presence of a prominent stromal component resulted in low-power microscopic appearances resembling fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, or fibrocystic disease of the breast in two cases. The carcinomatous component grew in the form of anastomosing narrow tubules, clustered glands, solid sheets with or without squamous differentiation, and/or papillae, and exhibited the typical nuclear features of PTC. The abundant stroma had a nodular fasciitis-like quality and was composed of short fascicles of spindle cells separated by varying amounts of mucoid matrix, collagen, and extravasated red blood cells; this was interpreted as an exuberant mesenchymal reaction to the carcinoma. The importance of recognizing this variant of PTC is that, when one encounters a fibroproliferative lesion of the thyroid, a diligent search should be made for papillary carcinoma. This variant also must be distinguished from the vastly more aggressive papillary carcinomas with anaplastic transformation and the so-called carcinosarcomas.\r"

Overlying adenomas were present in 45% and squamous differentiation in 21% of tumors. Endocrine differentiation was present in all tumors by at least one method; neuron-specific enolase, dense-core granules, and synaptophysin were present in most cases. Seventy-one percent of tumors metastasized to the liver; 64% of patients were dead at five months follow-up. Twenty-one poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and undifferentiated carcinomas of the large intestine accessioned during the same period showed less endocrine (7 of 21) and squamous differentiation (1 of 15) and fewer liver metastases (4 of 15) than did small cell carcinomas. Among all 59 tumors studied, small cell histologic characteristics correlated better with liver involvement than did endocrine markers or other histologic features. Small cell carcinomas of the large intestine are aggressive tumors with a propensity for early liver involvement. Although there is a spectrum of squamous, endocrine, and glandular features in large bowel tumors of low degrees of differentiation, the identification of a small cell component appears to be most clinically relevant.\r"

The authors assessed its value in the diagnosis of lung carcinomas metastatic to lung/pleura and pleural malignant mesothelioma (MM), using cell blocks derived from cytologic specimens. Sixty-three primary lung carcinomas, 31 metastatic adenocarcinomas (ACs) (from breast, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary tract), and 36 MMs were immunostained with 44-3A6, Leu-M1, and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The results confirm the value of 44-3A6 in identifying ACs but do not allow distinction between those of pulmonary, breast, GIT, or ovarian mucinous derivation. Endometrial, ovarian serous, and renal ACs are essentially nonreactive, as are almost all MMs. The occurrence of one positive MM predicates caution in interpreting 44-3A6 positivity in isolation, but, judiciously used with other discriminating antibodies such as Leu-M1 and anti-CEA, 44-3A6 is of value in the differential diagnosis of ACs and MMs. Further, its applicability to cytologic specimens may obviate the need for more invasive diagnostic procedures and lead to rapid, accurate diagnosis.\r"

In granulomatous prostatitis, histiocytes were not immunoreactive for PAP, PSA, or cytokeratin; however, histiocytes reacted to lysozyme in nine of nine cases, antimacrophage M in seven of nine cases, and LCA in one of nine cases. Tumor cells from all six carcinoma cases reacted with PAP, PSA, and cytokeratin; all failed to react with lysozyme, LCA, and antimacrophage M.

These results were compared with those obtained by an automated peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with DNAse pretreatment of fixed embedded sections (Method 2), with ER immunostain on frozen sections (Method 3), and with biochemical results (dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic [DCC] assay). Compared with the DCC assay, Methods 1, 2, and 3 gave sensitivities of 54%, 25%, and 89%, respectively. The sensitivity for Method 1 was increased to 74% in those cases with DCC results showing greater than 50 fmol/mg protein. These findings indicate that ER immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (as assayed by Method 1) provide useful clinical information when the results are positive. A negative result, especially if surrounding normal elements are not positive, may indicate no receptors, receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg protein, or improper tissue preservation. In the absence of fresh tissue for ER assay by DCC assay or of frozen sections for immunostaining, and with an understanding of its limitations, this method may be useful.\r"

Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic (EM), and DNA flow cytometric (FCM) studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the second patient on both the primary tumor and the recurrence. Tumor cells expressed vimentin and were focally positive for desmin and myoglobin. EM findings suggested a fibroblastic differentiation. An aneuploid cell population was present in the recurrent tumor by DNA-FCM studies. Only four other cases of so-called ovarian myxoma were reported to date, and the follow-up does not exceed 18 months. The authors conclude that the presence of aneuploidy and the late recurrence of one of their cases suggest that certain ovarian myxomas might behave like low-grade sarcomas. The histogenesis of this tumor remains unsettled, but similarities were found with myxomas in other locations.\r"

  ".W": "The demonstration of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in human lymphoproliferative processes with the use of DNA hybridization has gained great popularity as a sensitive laboratory adjunct to diagnostic hematopathology. The fact that nearly all B- or T-cell malignant lymphomas and leukemias have one or more rearranged antigen receptor genes provides a biologic basis for a diagnostic test. To formally analyze the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of human lymphoproliferative disease, the authors conducted a large, multiinstitutional study. Through a blinded, controlled approach, gene rearrangement analysis of 275 cases was shown to carry a high correlation with conventional phenotyping and histologic diagnosis, with only minor false-positive and false-negative rates. Significantly, no rearrangements were detected in normal lymphoid tissues or carcinomas, sarcomas, or melanomas. In a randomized study of 50 cases, laboratory results showed a high rate of interlaboratory agreement, regardless of the level of previous experience. Furthermore, the reproducibility of interpretation of data (Southern blot autoradiograms) of 192 cases showed high concordance among 11 observers from multiple laboratories. Based on these findings, the authors propose a set of guidelines for interpretation of gene rearrangement analysis that, if carefully followed, renders this a highly reproducible, safe, and accurate addition to the diagnostic regimen for human lymphoproliferative processes.\r"

  ".W": "In a phase I/II study, bone marrow biopsy specimens and aspirates of 20 patients with malignant tumors but normal bone marrow (n = 6), bone marrow failure resulting from chemotherapy (n = 4), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 5), and aplastic anemia (n = 5) were evaluated before and after patients were treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). This cytokine proved to be an effective hematopoietic growth factor with only mild side effects. The rhIL-3 treatment led to increased overall bone marrow cellularity with trilinear stimulation of hematopoietic cells, except in most patients with aplastic anemia. In all patients, significant eosinophilia and, in some instances, bone marrow fibrosis developed. In addition to the increase in the number of circulating neutrophilic granulocytes, platelets, and reticulocytes, an increase of peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes was observed. The histologic and cytologic findings support the concept that rhIL-3 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. It appears to be a safe and efficient therapeutic modality in patients with bone marrow failure. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine which patients will profit most from rhIL-3 treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The My4 antibody, one of a number of monoclonal antibodies that react with the CD14 antigen, was originally reported to weakly stain monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. However, recent studies have shown that the My4 antibody also stains normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes and some subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, the authors have studied a large series of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas stained with the My4 antibody. In frozen sections of reactive lymph node biopsy specimens, the My4 antibody strongly stained mantle zone B lymphocytes and weakly reacted with dendritic reticulum cells and histiocytes. In a series of 245 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the My4 antibody stained 111 (45%) cases: 108 of 189 (57%) B-cell lymphomas, 3 of 50 (6%) T-cell lymphomas, and 0 of 6 null cell lymphomas. My4-positive B-cell lymphomas occurred in all histologic subtypes with the exception of small noncleaved cell lymphomas. Follicular lymphomas were most often My4 positive (82%). My4 antibody staining showed no correlation with Working Formulation grade. All three My4-positive T-cell lymphomas had a mature T-cell phenotype. Seventy-six of the 111 (68%) My4-positive lymphomas were also analyzed with at least one other anti-CD14 antibody, either Mo2 and/or Leu-M3. In all cases the antigens that react with Mo2 and Leu-M3 were not expressed. Thus, the staining of reactive and neoplastic B cells by My4 appears to be unique to this antibody and is not a feature of all anti-CD14 antibodies.\r"

Four patients had inclusions within monocytes and neutrophils in the peripheral blood smear. The authors believe these cases represent the first reported examples of MAC inclusions observed within leukocytes in Wright's-stained peripheral blood smears. Inclusions usually were found in the setting of prominent toxic changes in leukocytes such as large Dohle bodies, marked granulation, and vacuolation. These inclusions are characteristic of mycobacteria and can be confirmed by acid fast stains and mycobacteriologic culture. The authors present the clinical and laboratory setting in which identification of inclusions in peripheral blood smears may be a rapid, minimally invasive, and cost-effective method of diagnosing mycobacterial infection.\r"

In this study, the authors used flow cytometry (FCM) to analyze TdT expression in human hematopoietic malignancies. Cells were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde, briefly exposed to nonionic detergent, and subsequently labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-TdT antibodies followed by fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgG and propidium iodide (PI), which was used for the simultaneous analysis of DNA content. Cells from 20 of 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), 4 of 7 mixed lineage leukemias, 2 of 21 acute myeloid and myelomonocytic leukemias, 1 of 2 chronic myeloid leukemias in blast crisis, 1 lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 1 thymoma were TdT positive. Cells from 13 nonlymphoblastic lymphomas, 3 myelodysplastic bone marrows, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 29 normal individuals were negative. An excellent correlation was seen between this assay, the conventional slide immunofluorescence technique, and an enzyme immunoassay method. The FCM assay detected as few as 2% blasts in mixing experiments of TdT-containing leukemic cells with normal peripheral lymphocytes. Furthermore, the combined analysis of TdT and DNA allowed the recognition of aneuploid TdT positive cells in four cases of ALL. The high sensitivity, the quantitative information obtained, and the capability of simultaneously analyzing DNA content make this method of TdT analysis more valuable than conventional techniques.\r"

Constant errors for the VCS were less than the H-1 for neutrophils and monocytes and greater than the H-1 for eosinophils and lymphocytes. H-1 morphologic false-negative rates were twice those for VCS. True-positive and false-negative rates in cases with immature neutrophils were 70.6% and 20.3% for the VCS and 35% and 55.9% for the H-1. The reference false-positive rate was 4.4%. Clinically appropriate VCS flags were generated in distributionally abnormal cases. Predictive values were higher for the VCS.\r"

The purpose of this report is to describe the methodology of the review process. A quality assurance (QA) monitor was created in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) to screen indicators: hemoglobin for PRCs and platelet count for PLTs. Numerical value limits were defined to determine acceptable ranges. Each week, the LIS compiles a list of all patients who received transfusions and for whom the QA monitor determined that the values of the screened indicators were outside the defined appropriate limits. A detailed transfusion record is generated for each patient identified. During a six-month evaluation of this program, a total of 1,788 PRC and 3,109 PLT units were transfused. Of these, 582 PRC (32.5%) and 2,219 PLT (71.4%) units were within the acceptable guidelines. Lists for the remaining 1,206 PRCs and 890 PLTs were generated. Review of the transfusion record and other laboratory values from the LIS established the appropriateness of 1,052 PRC and 782 PLT transfusions. At the conclusion of the six-month period, the medical charts for 181 (11%) PRC and 108 (4.5%) PLT transfusions required chart review. This method provided major reduction in time of the transfusion review process. Similar guidelines may be used to monitor other transfusion products such as fresh frozen plasma.\r"

The direct antiglobulin test became strongly positive with both anti-IgG and anticomplement. The serum contained an antibody that, in the presence of ceftazidime, sensitized unmodified reagent cells with IgG and complement (immune-complex type). The serum also agglutinated ceftazidime-pretreated cells at room temperature and 37 degrees C (drug-adsorption type). Retrospective testing disclosed that the drug adsorption antibody, which had been present before the current course of antibiotics, was not demonstrable during the hemolysis. The reactivity of the immune complex antibody, which developed by the second day of ceftazidime, paralleled the degree of hemolysis and the strength of the direct antiglobulin test. The authors believe that this patient had two separate ceftazidime-dependent antibodies and that the antibody reactive by immune complex mechanism mediated an episode of acute intravascular hemolysis.\r"

The second policy required that the CSF VDRL be performed as a retrospective test without regard to the patient's serologic status. The third policy required that a patient be seropositive by either rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbance (FTA-ABS) before a CSF VDRL could be performed. Before these policies were instituted, VDRL testing was performed on 18.2% of all CSF samples. The optional and required retrospective policies decreased the CSF VDRL rate to 13.0% and 8.5%, respectively, but the percentages of seropositive patients for whom these procedures were performed were only 7.3% and 12.9%. The third policy decreased the CSF VDRL test rate to 1.8% (P less than 0.001) with seropositivity improving to 90%. To assure serologic tests are obtained in the evaluation of neurosyphilis, requirement for seropositivity must be implemented with the use of retrospective CSF VDRL testing.\r"

Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, and stepwise logistic regression were performed. A diagnostic algorithm was constructed using a computer-assisted rule generation program. Myopathic diseases yielded a greater mean increase in serum enzyme activity than atrophic diseases. By multivariate stepwise logistic regression, increases in serum AST and CK activity were independently associated with the presence of inflammation in a muscle biopsy specimen. The diagnostic algorithm allowed for the separation of myopathies from atrophies and could identify cases of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and polymyositis.\r"

This study evaluates three approaches to improving the use of the cerebrospinal (CSF) acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear and culture procedure: (1) education alone; (2) optional screening by which physicians can select to have the AFB analysis stopped if the initial CSF findings are unremarkable; and (3) mandatory screening before the performance of all CSF AFB analyses. With education alone, the CSF AFB culture rate decreased from 20.6% of all CSF acquisitions to 15.7% (P less than 0.001); however, the effect may have been related to a decrease in all types of AFB testing. Optional screening had no impact on the AFB testing rate. Mandatory screening significantly decreased the CSF AFB rate to 6.7% (P less than 0.001), unrelated to changes in other types of AFB testing. Laboratories that employ mandatory screening should report the screening results immediately and have a mechanism whereby physicians can bypass the screen, providing CSF AFB analysis on unremarkable fluid from high-risk patients.\r"

The lesion is characterized histologically by highly organized ultrastructural deposits that appear to be composed of immunoglobulin and complement and are negative for amyloid by Congo red stain. Clinically and/or serologically, patients have no evidence of cryoglobulinemia, amyloidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or a paraproteinemia, disorders associated with glomerular deposits, which also have a highly organized tactoidal or fibrillar characteristic. Immunotactoid glomerulopathy does not appear to be a multisystemic disease process and thus may represent a primary glomerulopathy. Patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy present with proteinuria (nephrotic range in more than 60%) and over half of the patients have hypertension, hematuria, and renal insufficiency. Progression to end stage renal disease has occurred in more than 40% of patients reported to date. The experience in treating this disorder using prednisone and/or immunosuppression is limited and has not been impressive. Four patients have successfully undergone renal transplantation, but proteinuria recurred in two and was associated with the recurrence of immunotactoid glomerulopathy in the renal allograft. Although we have gained insight into the clinical course and histopathology of this disorder over the past few years, we still know little about its pathogenesis, an area for further research.\r"

Experimental data suggest that this injury results from intraglomerular hypertension and/or chronic glomerular hyperfiltration. Data in humans largely are limited to patients with unilateral renal agenesis or uninephrectomy, either for unilateral renal disease or for kidney transplant donation. Isolated case reports have documented focal sclerosis and progressive renal failure in two patients with a remnant kidney. To obtain data in humans with a remnant kidney, we surveyed more than 800 urologists and nephrologists in the United States and abroad. Criteria for inclusion in the study were (1) surgical resection (in one or more operations) resulting in the presence of a remnant kidney; and (2) an adequate period of follow-up, defined as 5 years or greater. A total of 13 patients were identified (from 13 different centers). Twelve patients had renal cancer and one had tuberculosis. Six patients were observed for 10 or more years postoperatively and all have stable serum creatinine levels of less than 270 mumol/L (3.0 mg/dL); two of these six patients are now more than 25 and 30 years postoperation. The other seven patients, observed for 5 to 7 years, have serum creatinine levels less than 270 mumol/L (3 mg/dL), while one has an increasing serum creatinine level. The two longest surviving patients both have undergone successful pregnancy with no overall change in serum creatinine. These observations demonstrate that it is possible for humans to survive more than 30 years with a stable serum creatinine, despite the presence of only a remnant kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Whether extensive ablation of renal mass in humans leads to progressive glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria, and hypertension, as it does in animal models, is a matter of controversy. We have studied kidney function in six patients who underwent enucleation of a renal cell carcinoma in a solitary kidney. Four patients had previously had a nephrectomy. The two others each had one atrophic, nonfunctioning kidney. Serum creatinine levels before surgery were within the normal range (mean, 99.9 mumol/L [1.13 mg/dL]). Two weeks after tumor enucleation, creatinine levels were significantly higher than the preoperative values (mean, 124.6 mumol/L [1.41 mg/dL]). The follow-up period varied from 10 to 23 months. In all patients, kidney function improved during the following months. Serum creatinine levels nearly reached preoperative values in all patients (mean, 105.2 mumol/L [1.19 mg/dL]). None of the patients showed a progressive deterioration in renal function or proteinuria. We found a modest increase in blood pressure in two patients who had been normotensive before surgery. In conclusion, tumor enucleation in a solitary kidney did not cause significant renal injury to the remnant kidneys in our patients, at least in the short term.\r"

Samples obtained 15 minutes after initiation of dialysis with new cuprophane membranes demonstrated significantly increased (P less than 0.05) ROS production in both cell populations as measured by the fluorescence of a specific intracellular marker (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate [DCFH-DA]) assayed by flow cytometry. Granulocytes harvested during dialysis also showed decreased responsiveness to exogenous C5a and F-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after initiation of dialysis (P less than 0.05). Our data suggest that hemodialysis with cuprophane membrane is associated with monocyte and PMNL activation as shown by production of ROS coincident with peak activation of the complement cascade; these granulocytes become refractory to further stimulation with C5a and FMLP during dialysis.\r"

Sixteen male patients undergoing routine maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease were prospectively studied before and after hemodialysis. Following hemodialysis there was a significant prolongation (P less than 0.05) in LV isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), as well as a significant reduction in the rate and extent of early rapid ventricular filling (P less than 0.005); in contrast, late atrial-assisted filling did not change significantly. A multiple stepwise linear regression analysis of predialysis hemodynamic parameters and noninvasive indices of LV filling showed that there was a significant independent inverse relationship between the frequency of dialysis-related hypotensive episodes and the duration of early LV filling (r = -0.81; P less than 0.001). These results suggest that hemodialysis results in discrete alterations in early LV filling, with no significant compensatory increase in late atrial-assisted ventricular filling. Further, patients with the shortest early LV filling times appeared to have the greatest predilection for becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis.\r"

We conclude from our study that the increase of blood pressure as seen in patients on dialysis, who are effectively treated with r-HuEPO, is due to an increase in peripheral resistance. This increase overrules the decrease of cardiac index and might well be a result of peripheral vasoconstriction due to improved oxygen availability.\r"

All patients on Epo had a significant (P less than 0.001) elevation of hematocrit levels (19.7% v 35.7%).

Protein catabolic rate also increased significantly (P less than 0.05). No changes were seen in the levels of serum creatinine and potassium, but episodes of hyperkalemia were more frequent in patients on Epo. No changes were seen in patients on placebo. When hematocrit increased, the clearance of blood-water for urea decreased 9%, and the clearance of creatinine, potassium, and phosphorus decreased 15%. Patients on Epo increased both their appetite and protein intake. More frequent episodes of hyperkalemia and elevated phosphorus level resulted from a combination of increased intake and decreased dialyzer clearance. We may need blood-water clearance to calculate Kt/V.\r"

  ".W": "Three urea kinetic analyses were applied to hemodialysis and their conformity assessed. Sixteen patients underwent 50 measurements of dialyzer clearance (K), protein catabolic rate (PCR), and dialysis quantification (Kt/V) using the urea kinetic model (UKM) of Gotch and Sargent, Malchesky's direct dialysis quantification (DDQ), and the graphic technique of urea reduction analysis (URA) devised by Keshaviah. Additionally, the equations proposed by Jindal (percent urea reduction), and Daugirdas were used to calculate Kt/V values for each study. Dialyzer performance determined by whole blood urea clearance consistently exceeded simultaneous dialysate urea removal and was 55% greater than the clearance calculated by DDQ. Despite these variations, dialysis adequacy (Kt/V) and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) were remarkably constant when derived by fixed-volume single-pool analyses (ie, UKM, DDQ, and URA). Application of variable-volume corrections increased Kt/V and nPCR, but caused DDQ values to diverge from those of UKM and URA. During rapid high-efficiency dialysis (RHED), the UKM predicted urea removal in excess of that documented by DDQ. During this trial (low-level RHED with K = 2.98 mL.kg-1 per min), urea dysequilibrium across blood-cell interfaces was sufficient to cause UKM to overestimate protein catabolism by 5%. The basic assumption of single-pool kinetics may be inappropriate during RHED, and further increases in dialyzer clearance will increase the discrepancy between projected and actual urea removal. Future comparisons of RHED prescriptions should employ mass balance data, or redesigned kinetic analyses.\r"

Complications of angiography occurred in 17% of patients; there were no complications of fistula assessment monitoring. Fistula assessment monitoring was better than combined clinical assessment in predicting clinical outcome for arteriovenous fistulae over 6 months and was as good as angiography. Routine fistula assessment monitoring could reduce inappropriate angiography and detect clinically significant silent stenoses. It is an ideal method for monitoring arteriovenous access fistulae.\r"

Recent studies implicate terminal complement complexes (TCC) in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury. The fluid phase TCC, SC5b-9, reflects the formation of membrane-bound C5b-9 and has been used as a clinical marker in various diseases. Plasma concentrations of SC5b-9 were measured with an enzyme immunoassay using a monoclonal antibody to a neoantigen expressed on the SC5b-9 complex in 13 children who presented with clinical and pathologic features of APSGN. SC5b-9 was significantly elevated in all plasmas obtained within 30 days after onset of clinical glomerulonephritis. Concentrations of SC5b-9 in acute plasmas were significantly higher than those of paired convalescent samples. For individual patients, as SC5b-9 concentration returned to normal there was a coincident decrease in serum creatinine concentration and urinary protein excretion, signifying clinical improvement in glomerulonephritis. Thus, TCC generation commonly occurs in the early stages of APSGN and may be of importance in the pathogenesis of the condition.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to a 3-month period of a normal protein diet (NPD, 1.3 mg/kg/d) or of a low-protein diet (LPD, 0.6 mg/kg/d), in a cross-over design. Dietary protein restriction did not affect glomerular filtration rate (47.8 +/- 10.7 and 49.0 +/- 13.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, LPD and NPD, respectively) and renal plasma flow (456 +/- 119 and 499 +/- 161 mL/min/1.73 m2, LPD and NPD, respectively), nor did it significantly improve glomerular permselective function, as shown by urinary protein excretion (3.1 +/- 2.2 and 3.5 +/- 2.8 g/d, LPD and NPD, respectively) and fractional clearance of albumin, IgG, and neutral dextran molecules of graded molecular size (radii ranging from 2.8 to 6.0 nm). These results indicate that reduction of protein intake to 0.6 g/kg/d does not improve glomerular size selectivity in membranous nephropathy.

A similar protocol was used to test its effect in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and also in hypoparathyroid subjects (HOPT) during treatment with dihydrotachysterol (DHT). Nine subjects with PHPT, 10 with HOPT, and one with pseudo-HOPT were evaluated after Na-restricted (80 mmol/d) and Na-supplemented (200 mmol/d) diets for 7 days each with dietary Ca constant. Na restriction resulted in a decrease in mean urinary 24-hour Ca excretion in PHPT subjects (10.6 v 7.6 mmol/d [424 v 304 mg], P less than 0.0001) and in one pseudo-HOPT subject, similar to the pattern seen previously in IH subjects. In contrast, Na restriction was not accompanied by significant change in Ca excretion in HOPT. There was no change in serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels in either group when Na intake was altered. Thus, the presence of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is necessary for sodium-related alterations in urinary Ca to occur. The effect of PTH appears to be \"permissive\" rather than \"active.\" Dietary Na restriction may have a role in the management of hypercalciuria in mild PHPT cases when parathyroidectomy is contraindicated.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Self-reported cutaneous exposures to blood, sputum, urine, feces, and other body substances were evaluated separately in 559 workers during the first survey and 269 workers during the second. RESULTS: Mean annual blood exposures decreased from 35.8 to 18.1, and mean annual exposures to all substances decreased from 77.8 to 40.0 (p less than 0.001 for both determinations). Two matched analyses of a subset of 200 participants who completed both surveys had similar results. Reported exposures to blood, presumably infectious blood, sputum, presumably infectious sputum, and urine were significantly decreased. Participants were tested for antibodies to HIV-1; no participant reporting cutaneous exposures acquired HIV-1 infection. The upper bound for the 95% confidence interval for the risk of HIV-1 infection associated with a single cutaneous exposure was 0.04% for blood presumed to contain HIV-1 and 0.02% for any body substance presumed to contain HIV-1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Universal Precautions training significantly decreased but did not eliminate cutaneous exposures to blood and body substances. The results further suggest that the risk for HIV-1 infection associated with cutaneous exposures is substantially lower than the risk associated with parenteral exposures.\r"

  ".U": "91143733\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The metabolic disturbances seen during infection are thought to be due to cytokines, modulators of the immune response. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by a high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia and at times depletion of body cell mass (wasting). Elevated circulating levels of cytokines have also been reported in AIDS. Therefore, we determined the relationship between circulating cytokine levels and lipid levels and between circulating cytokine levels and wasting in AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 45 patients with AIDS, 13 subjects with evidence of HIV infection by presence of antibody but without AIDS (HIV positive), and 17 seronegative control subjects who had previously undergone body composition analysis were analyzed for triglyceride, cholesterol, interferon, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 levels. Eleven subjects with AIDS or HIV infection had sequential measurements. Interferon was analyzed by bioassay with identification using specific antibodies. TNF and interleukin-1 were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lean body mass was assessed by total body potassium. RESULTS: Serum interferon-alpha levels were significantly elevated in patients with AIDS (p less than 0.001 compared to controls), with detectable levels in 84% of AIDS patients. Interferon-alpha was not detectable in serum from controls, while three of 13 HIV-positive subjects had detectable interferon-alpha levels. There was a significant correlation between interferon-alpha levels and serum triglyceride levels in AIDS and HIV-positive patients (R = 0.446, p less than 0.002). There was no relationship between interferon-alpha and serum cholesterol levels (R = -0.039, NS). In contrast only 11% of AIDS patients had detectable circulating TNF levels; the mean value for and the prevalence of detectable serum TNF levels were not significantly different from those of control subjects. Interleukin-1 was not detected in the circulation. There was no correlation between the presence of circulating TNF and serum triglycerides. There was no relationship between circulating interferon-alpha or TNF levels and the presence of wasting as measured by total body potassium. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that interferon-alpha, which has previously been shown to modulate lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro, may be responsible for the hypertriglyceridemia found in AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The study objective was to evaluate the effects of long-term methadone use and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II seropositivity on the distribution of lymphocyte subsets and on lymphocyte function as measured in vitro in intravenous drug users seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-HIV-1-negative intravenous drug users receiving methadone maintenance therapy (n = 24) were studied in a Veterans Administration drug abuse treatment center. These subjects were compared to 38 age- and sex-matched control subjects who did not abuse drugs. HIV-1 and HTLV serostatus was determined by repetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoblot. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by two-color flow cytometry. Lymphocyte function was measured by proliferative response to plant mitogens and by natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity to a tumor cell target. RESULTS: Significant differences were seen in lymphocyte phenotype in the methadone-treated group, with elevations in the T-cell helper subset CD4+CD26+; in CD8 and CD8+I2+ cells, suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and activated suppressor/cytotoxic T cells; and in CD2+CD26+ cells and activated total T lymphocytes. Lymphocyte function was suppressed in the methadone group, with poor responses to pokeweed mitogen and phytohemagglutinin in culture. Moreover, NK-cell cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in the methadone group. None of these immunologic differences were attributable to HTLV serostatus. CONCLUSION: The immune abnormalities seen suggest that a clinically significant degree of immune impairment exists in methadone-treated intravenous drug users. However, these abnormalities could not be explained by the presence of other retroviruses in this HIV-1-negative study group, as there was no significant difference in immune function when HTLV-seropositive patients were compared to HTLV-seronegative subjects treated with methadone.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the effect of progestin therapy on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women and to compare its effects to those of estrogen. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized clinical trial was performed in 81 postmenopausal women aged 51.7 +/- 4.4 years (mean +/- SD). They were assigned to one of four groups: Provera 20 mg, Premarin 0.6 mg, Premarin 0.3 mg plus Provera 10 mg, and a placebo. In addition, all women received calcium supplementation, if necessary, to a calcium intake of 1,000 mg/day. We used single- and dual-photon absorpiometry, metacarpal radiogrammetry, and computed axial tomography to measure bone mineral density in the total skeleton, spine, radius, and metacarpal. RESULTS: Women receiving placebo lost bone at all sites (p less than 0.01). The Provera-treated group showed no change in total body calcium, but there were decreases in radial density (p less than 0.01), metacarpal cortex (p less than 0.01), and spine density (p less than 0.01). The Premarin-treated group had an increase in spine density and total body density (p less than 0.05), but a decrease in radial density (p less than 0.05). The Premarin-plus-Provera group showed no change in spine density, total body calcium, or radial density but had a decrease in metacarpal cortex (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to placebo, Provera reduced the rate of loss in cortical areas of the skeleton, but not in the spine, which contains more trabecular bone. In contrast, Premarin reduced the rate of loss in both cortical and trabecular areas of the skeleton. The low-dose combination of Premarin plus Provera was similar in its effect on bone to that of Premarin alone, suggesting that there may be a synergistic effect of this hormone combination on bone. Serum cholesterol levels decreased with Provera, Premarin, and the combination of both, whereas levels of serum triglycerides increased with Premarin treatment, decreased with the Provera regimen, and were unchanged with the combination therapy. Provera does not adversely affect the lipid profile.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of this article is to report the experience of three centers with combined hepatic and renal transplantation for pyridoxine-resistant primary hyperoxaluria type I (alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase [EC 2.6.1.44] deficiency), with particular emphasis on the selection criteria and timing of the operation. Nine patients with this inherited disease were treated by combined hepatic and renal transplantation. The former replaces the enzyme-deficient organ while the latter replaces the functionally affected organ. RESULTS: One patient with gross systemic oxalosis died in the immediate postoperative period and another died 8 weeks postoperatively of a generalized cytomegalovirus infection, having shown evidence of biochemical correction. One patient with particularly severe osteodystrophy at the time of the operation died 14 months postoperatively from renal failure due to progressive calcium oxalate nephrocalcinosis involving the transplanted kidney, plus thromboembolic disease. He also had very extensive systemic oxalosis. An additional patient with severe osteodystrophy died 9 months postoperatively. One patient developed hyper-rejection of the kidney and died later of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The four long-term survivors (22 to 38 months) have remained asymptomatic from the standpoint of their renal disease, with resolution of any manifestations of systemic oxalosis that they may have had. They are either employed or continuing their education. CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged period of end-stage renal failure treated by dialysis regimens that are suitable for non-hyperoxaluric renal failure and extensive systemic oxalosis, particularly oxalotic osteodystrophy, are poor prognostic features. We propose that hepatic transplantation should be considered as definitive treatment before end-stage renal failure develops. This should be supplemented by renal transplantation with vigorous pre- and perioperative hemodialysis to deplete the body stores of oxalate. Although some authorities would reserve hepatic transplantation for patients in whom renal transplantation has failed, we suggest that combined liver and kidney transplantation is appropriate in patients who have never had a renal graft. Furthermore, the time has come to consider hepatic transplantation before any irreversible renal damage has occurred in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed a series of patients in whom the diagnosis of mitral stenosis was first discovered in the echocardiography laboratory. Because of this experience, we examined the records of 152 patients with echocardiographic evidence of rheumatic mitral stenosis to determine the clinical characteristics and course of patients with unsuspected mitral stenosis as well as those factors that may have obscured the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of these 152 patients, 18 had mitral stenosis that was unsuspected clinically until the echocardiogram. These patients were elderly, with a median age of 72 years. They were all referred for echocardiography because of cardiac symptoms. Eight patients were referred for evaluation of congestive heart failure. Five patients were referred for evaluation of aortic valve disease. Three patients were referred because of cerebrovascular accidents and atrial fibrillation. The Doppler-determined mean diastolic mitral gradient ranged from 4 to 15 mm Hg (mean: 7 mm Hg). Mitral stenosis ranged in severity from trivial to very severe. Eight patients had moderate to severe mitral stenosis with estimated mitral valve areas less than or equal to 1.5 cm2. Seven had mild or trivial mitral stenosis with estimated mitral valve areas greater than 1.5 cm2. After further evaluation, two patients underwent mitral valve surgery with improvement of congestive failure. In three patients, warfarin therapy was begun to prevent emboli. Thus, five of 18 patients had a significant immediate change in therapy because of the discovery of mitral stenosis. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of mitral stenosis may not be suspected in the presence of advanced age, other serious cardiac and medical conditions, or mechanical factors that complicate the physical examination. In these patients, mitral stenosis may be hemodynamically significant and may cause significant symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Doppler ultrasound is a sensitive modality for detecting and quantitating valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis. Because valvular regurgitation leads to heart failure, we evaluated the prognostic significance of Doppler-detected valvular regurgitation in patients with endocarditis who had not yet developed clinical heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis from May 1985 to March 1990. A total of 49 patients were included in the study: 33 patients with native valve endocarditis and 16 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. The initial Doppler echocardiogram was examined in these patients to determine the presence and degree of valvular regurgitation. RESULTS: Significant (moderate to severe) valvular regurgitation was detected in 23 (47%) patients. The presence or absence of significant valvular regurgitation did not predict the development of congestive heart failure, the need for surgery, or death (p = NS). The development of congestive heart failure was significantly associated with the need for surgery (p less than 0.0001) and death (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the detection of significant valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis who have not yet developed heart failure is not predictive of future complications nor does the absence of significant valvular regurgitation identify a group of patients with a more favorable prognosis. In our series, patients who developed congestive heart failure had a significantly higher incidence of surgery and death. Therefore, decisions regarding clinical management in patients with infective endocarditis should not be made solely on the presence or absence of echocardiographically detected valvular regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: This study compared the safety and efficacy of labetalol and enalapril as antihypertensive therapy for elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, parallel controlled trial was conducted. After completing a 4-week placebo phase, 79 elderly (65 years or older) patients with an average standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95 mm Hg or above and 114 mm Hg or less were randomized to receive a 12-week course of either labetalol or enalapril in an open-label design. The patients' BP and heart rate were evaluated biweekly by trained observers unaware of the treatment status, and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg twice a day of labetalol or 40 mg daily of enalapril) to achieve a standing diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 weeks of active treatment. RESULTS: The treatment groups were comparable in their reduction of supine diastolic BP, with no significant differences between the two treatments. Labetalol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in standing diastolic BP at the end of the titration period compared to enalapril, but this difference was not significant by the end of the study period. Based on 24-hour ABPM readings, labetalol reduced mean 24-hour diastolic BP (p less than 0.05) and mean heart rate (p less than 0.05) more than enalapril. The labetalol-treated patients were significantly less often above their diastolic BP goal throughout the 24-hour ABPM period (p less than 0.01). The two treatments were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that labetalol and enalapril are equally effective in lowering supine diastolic BP in the elderly, but labetalol is more effective in lowering ambulatory BP and heart rate throughout the day.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the hospital records from 19 episodes (18 patients) of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease (greater than or equal to 19 years of age) who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy to obtain lower airway cultures between January 1979 and July 1987. We also recorded patients' clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic characteristics. RESULTS: Pneumonia was diagnosed in four of 19 episodes (21%) of acute chest syndrome based on quantitative cultures obtained at bronchoscopy. The pneumonia was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in two patients and mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the other two patients. Forty-four of 45 blood cultures were negative, and one grew Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was considered a contaminant. Chest roentgenograms revealed lower lobe involvement in 17 episodes (90%) and bilateral infiltrates in six (32%). Pleural effusions occurred in seven episodes (37%), and pleural fluid samples obtained from five of these revealed sterile exudates. CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective study suggest that bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon cause of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease. These results are consistent with previous retrospective studies using noninvasive techniques to diagnose pneumonia. Nevertheless, there appeared to be no reliable noninvasive variables that could accurately differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia and, consequently, we recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in addition to usual supportive care of these patients.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one adult patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia were studied. Serum neutrophil-binding antibodies were measured using paraformaldehyde-fixed granulocytes (PFGs) from normal volunteers as target cells. 125I-labeled staphylococcal protein A was used to detect IgG antibodies while IgM antibodies were detected by using 125I-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-IgM antibody. Sera containing antineutrophil antibodies were tested for their ability to fix complement on donor PFGs by using 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody to the third component of complement. RESULTS: Of the 121 patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia, 71 patients had isolated neutropenia, while 50 had neutropenia combined with either anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Among the 71 patients with isolated neutropenia, there were 51 females (72%), compared with 28 females (56%) among the 50 patients with combined hemocytopenias (p = 0.083). Patients with multiple hemocytopenias were significantly older (p less than 0.01), were more likely to demonstrate splenomegaly (p = 0.001), and may have had more infectious complications. From all the patients, 36% of sera were shown to have antineutrophil antibodies, with a non-significant trend for these to be found more frequently in patients with multiple hemocytopenias. Sera with mixed IgG-IgM antineutrophil antibodies were significantly more likely to fix complement than those with isolated IgG or IgM antibodies, and among the patients with antineutrophil antibodies, complement-fixing antibodies were significantly associated with multiple hemocytopenias. Splenomegaly was significantly associated both with antineutrophil antibodies (p = 0.008) and with infections (p = 0.007). Antineutrophil antibodies were not associated with infections. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of adult patients with idiopathic neutropenia have IgG and/or IgM antineutrophil antibodies demonstrable in their serum. There is a subset of patients with idiopathic neutropenia with multiple hemocytopenias who tend to be older, less likely to show female predominance, more likely to have splenomegaly and infections, and more likely to have antineutrophil antibodies, especially mixed IgG-IgM and complement-fixing antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To compare the rate of local complications resulting from radioiodine ablation of thyroid cancer in patients with a residual intact thyroid lobe to that in patients who had more extensive surgical treatment prior to radioiodine administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 59 patients who had received 131I between 1979 and 1989. The patients were divided into two groups, depending on the extent of their previous surgical thyroid excision. Group 1 comprised 10 patients with a lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy before the ablative radioiodine dose, and Group 2 comprised 49 patients with more extensive thyroid excision (near-total or subtotal thyroidectomy) before the radioiodine treatment. RESULTS: Sixty percent of the 10 patients in Group 1 experienced some degree of neck pain or tenderness following radioiodine ablation of their residual thyroid. In one case, the local reaction was very severe and accompanied by the development of transient hyperthyroidism. There was only a 6% local complication rate in the patients who had undergone more extensive thyroid excision before ablative therapy (p less than 0.001), and none had a severe reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with only unilateral surgical excision before radioiodine therapy have a higher rate of local complications than do patients treated with more extensive surgery prior to radioiodine ablation. If radioiodine is to be employed in such patients, they should be informed of this possible complication. Since evidence supports a dose effect in the pathogenesis of the complications, we recommend using a dose of less than 30 mCi for the initial ablation in these patients even though it may be necessary to repeat this dose to complete thyroid ablation.\r"

Lower response rates were observed in patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, advanced Rai stages, and primary resistance to prior therapy. Toxicities were minimal except for febrile episodes associated with therapy. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine has shown encouraging results in these patients and deserves further investigation in combination with other active agents, and in the setting of front-line therapy.\r"

Based on longitudinal studies in the Pima Indians, a population with the world's highest reported prevalence of NIDDM, a two-step model for development of the disease is proposed. The first step is transition from normal to impaired glucose tolerance, for which insulin resistance is the main determinant, and the second and later step is worsening from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes, in which beta-cell dysfunction plays a critical role. This hypothesis is consistent with findings from other ethnic groups from many parts of the world.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Because of concern about the quality of care received by Medicare patients in health maintenance organizations (HMOs), the care of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) in eight HMOs was compared with the care of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the care of 170 patients with CHF enrolled in one of eight Medicare HMOs with the care of 191 similar FFS patients. Panels of expert physicians developed criteria for evaluating quality of care, and specially trained nurse clinicians abstracted medical records. RESULTS: Outpatient evaluation and management were similar in both settings, although HMO patients were significantly more likely to be advised to restrict salt intake. However, FFS patients with uncontrolled hypertension were more likely to have their medication regimens changed (62% versus 36%, p less than 0.01). Ejection fractions were obtained equally as often, and inpatient management was similar for both groups. Nonetheless, HMO providers scheduled follow-up visits within 1 week of hospital discharge more often (42% versus 27%, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that financial incentives of prepaid care are not detrimental to most aspects of care for CHF patients. More rapid follow-up after hospital discharge for patients with CHF suggests that HMOs may be more effective in delivering continuity of care for patients with chronic illness.\r"

Thyroid hormone therapy failed to suppress the TSH level. The TSH level was unresponsive to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) administration, alpha-subunits of pituitary glycoproteins were undetectable in her plasma, and imaging of the pituitary-hypothalamic region was normal. Measurement of TSH with an assay containing sheep antibody to TSH failed to reveal TSH in the patient's plasma. Addition of mouse IgG to the TSH fluoroimmunoassay reduced the patient's TSH to an undetectable level. These observations are consistent with a spurious elevation of TSH due to the presence of an anti-mouse antibody. Artifactual elevations of TSH have not been identified commonly, but this possibility should be considered when the TSH level is inappropriate for the apparent state of thyroid function.\r"

In all sites, the mice appeared most heavily infested by larvae; at least seven parasitized each mouse, about three per vole and four per lizard. Many fewer nymphal I. ricinus parasitized A. flavicollis and C. glareolus than did larvae. Although more than 30 times as many larval than nymphal ticks parasitized the two most abundant hosts (C. glareolus and A. flavicollis), about 15 times as many fed on A. agrarius and twice as many on lizards. Nymphal and larval ticks fed on rodents at about the same time. Lizards were most abundantly parasitized by nymphs somewhat earlier than by larvae. Early in the season of transmission of Lyme disease, virtually all A. agrarius as well as lizards were potentially exposed to spirochetes borne by nymphal I. ricinus. We concluded that larval and nymphal I. ricinus differentially parasitize different hosts. Because so many of these nymphs feed on them, A. agrarius may more effectively serve as reservoirs for the agent of Lyme disease than do other putative reservoir hosts. The presence of lizards may inhibit transmission.\r"

In contrast, adult worm-specific determinants resisted periodate treatment but were sensitive to proteases, indicating that they are polypeptides. The majority of cross-reactive Mabs studied were directed against phosphorylcholine determinants. When used in a dot-ELISA, Paragonimus-specific Mabs could detect 0.3-7 ng/ml parasite antigen in human sera.\r"

It has also been found that the dye stains the nucleic acid of viable Plasmodium falciparum. We have subsequently evaluated the staining of P. falciparum by benzothiocarboxypurine within red blood cells and have found that the red blood cell membrane is freely permeable to this dye and consequently P. falciparum is stained within the red blood cell. This finding prompted an in-depth analysis of the dye in the laboratory and in a field study as an alternative to Giemsa-stained blood smears and as a means of enhancing the microscopic diagnosis of malarial infection. In a field study the BCP dye allowed detection of malaria in fresh blood at a level equivalent to the Giemsa method (parasitemia ranged from 0.01% to 30%). The BCP staining procedure could also be used with fixed specimens although the differential staining characteristics were lost following specimen preparation. Of 111 blinded samples obtained in the field 22 were negative by Giemsa-stained thin smear, 16 were negative on thick smear and the same 16 were negative by BCP analysis. We have found that the BCP dye offers many advantages compared with the microscopic diagnosis of P. falciparum infection with standard Giemsa stains. These advantages are especially evident in conditions of low parasitemia, in the speed of staining and evaluation, and the relatively low level of training required to provide consistent results.\r"

Acridine orange fluorescent microscopy (AO/FM) of capillary centrifuged blood may offer an alternative technique. We compared AO/FM readings with G-TS in 290 specimens from asymptomatic people in Thai villages endemic for malaria. AO/FM specimens were prepared in modified capillary tubes coated with acridine orange (Quantitative Buffy Coat or \"QBC tubes\") and examined under a fluorescent microscope. Twenty-three (85.2%) of the 27 specimens found positive by G-TS had under 100 parasites/microliters blood (less than 35 parasites/200 microscopic fields). The overall AO/FM sensitivity was 78.9% [range: 66.7% (10/15)-86.7% (13/15)]. For Plasmodium falciparum, regardless of stages, the sensitivities varied from 66.7% (8/12) to 91.7% (11/12). AO/FM performed better for P. falciparum than for Plasmodium vivax and for asexual than for sexual stages of the parasite. However, the species- and stage-specific results must be interpreted with caution because of the small sample sizes and very low parasite densities involved. The test specificity was 96.6% [range: 95.6% (263/275)-97.1% (263/271)]. These levels of accuracy plus the known advantages of AO/FM suggest that the test, supplemented with G-TS to improve species and stage differentiation, is also useful for screening low-density parasitemias.\r"

Seventy-four (65%) of 114 men followed during assignment to a malaria transmission area developed blood-stage infection with P. vivax. IgG antibodies against the central repeat region of the CSPV protein were quantitated by ELISA using the recombinant protein, NS181V20, as the capture antigen. One quarter of the subjects had detectable anti-CSPV antibodies at the beginning of the study. CSPV antibody seroconversion was documented in 16 of 26 subjects assessed during their first observed episodes of vivax malaria. This antibody response was of moderate magnitude, fell off after the first week post-diagnosis and appeared, at the low levels observed, to be unassociated with protection. Continued assessment of anti-CSPV antibody after subjects left the transmission area found no increase associated with release of P. vivax. These findings indicate that CS antibody responses to P. vivax during occupational malaria share many characteristics with responses to P. falciparum.\r"

All were first given a 1-mg oral dose of ivermectin (phase 1) to reduce microfilaria densities. Participants were randomized into three groups: Group 1 received DEC (6mg/kg per day for 12 days), Group 2 received 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin, and Group 3 received 400 mcg/kg of ivermectin (200 mcg/kg per day for 2 days). All drug regimens were well tolerated with few adverse reactions. Most reactions occurred during phase I and consisted primarily of headache, fever, and myalgia. At the end of phase 1, 27 of 30 (90%) patients were microfilaria negative. During phase 2, four of the six men receiving DEC developed scrotal reactions suggesting killing adult worms; no such reactions were noted in 10 men receiving ivermectin (p less than 0.05). At one-year follow up (phase 3), all treatment groups had less than 10% return to pretreatment microfilaria levels. The mean percent of baseline microfilaria counts were for Group 1, 0.9% (range 0-5%); Group 2, 8.2% (range 0-31%); and Group 3, 3.8% (range 0-25%). Seven individuals in Group 1 were microfilaria-negative, while only one and three individuals were microfilaria-negative in Groups 2 and 3, respectively. These results suggest that DEC causes more damage to the adult worms and greater reduction in microfilaria densities than ivermectin, but that high doses of ivermectin may suppress microfilaremia in lymphatic filariasis for periods much longer than previously reported.\r"

The fused polypeptide FPAg632, when combined with MDP, also failed to induce protective immunity. However, the maximum level of parasitemia and serologic response to the 11-mer peptide were inversely correlated. The safety of the use of MDP was evident.\r"

Thus, DBA/2 (D2) mice infected with P. yoelii 17x were not adversely affected by removal of the spleen, while splenectomized C57BL/6 (B6) or Balb/c mice failed to resolve their infections and eventually died. The levels of parasitemia were lower in splenectomized mice compared to intact controls; however, splenectomized mice became as anemic as did spleen-intact controls. Splenectomy resulted in the appearance of large aggregates of mononuclear cells in the livers of infected mice and also altered the liver/body weight ratios. These results indicate that D2 mice have a spleen-independent mechanism of clearing parasites which is lacking in B6 and Balb/c mice.\r"

  ".U": "91143964\r", 
  ".W": "In order to develop an experimental model of symptomatic cryptosporidiosis in an immunosuppressed mammal, we investigated the pathophysiology of infection with Cryptosporidium and the humoral and cellular host responses in rnu/rnu (athymic) rats and their heterozygous (rnu/+) littermates by challenging suckling rats with greater than or equal to 2.5 x 10(6) Cryptosporidium oocytes oro-gastrically. Normal and immunodeficient animals were followed for onset and duration of infection (fecal oocysts), physiologic consequences (diarrhea, impaired weight gain, brush-border enzyme activities), and immunologic response (both B- and T-lymphocyte-mediated). Homozygosity for the rnu gene was associated with protracted cryptosporidial infections; shedding for up to 52 days occurred, and delay in weight gain was noted in rnu/rnu-infected compared with rnu/rnu-uninfected rats (p less than 0.05). In contrast, cryptosporidial challenge of rnu/+ rats resulted in self-resolving infections, occasionally with transient diarrhea lasting four days or less occurring 10-15 days after oro-gastric challenge. The latter animals mounted a cell-mediated immune response to Cryptosporidium: three months after challenge, five of five rnu/+ rats demonstrated positive skin test responses to a subcutaneous 3.5 micrograms dose of cryptosporidial antigen. Further, sera from 6 rnu/+ rats taken two to three months after oro-gastric oocyst challenge exhibited specific anticryptosporidial immunoglobulin binding (A405 = 0.96), compared to that of seven uninfected rnu/+ controls (A405 = 0.09, P less than 0.02). Macromolecules of 150, 105, and 88 kD in the Cryptosporidium antigen preparation were bound by serum immunoglobulin from previously infected, recovered rnu/+ rats. Two brush-border enzymes (lactase and alkaline phosphatase) were markedly reduced in the ileum 8-10 days after oro-gastric challenge in rats with diarrhea and oocyst shedding. We find the rnu/rnu (athymic, nude) rat provides a useful model for study of prolonged cryptosporidial infection with impaired weight loss, brush-border enzyme alteration and intermittent diarrhea. These studies further suggest that a T-lymphocyte population is involved in recovery from Cryptosporidium infection and that this recovery is associated with both cellular and humoral immune responses to specific cryptosporidial antigenic macromolecules. This model should open further avenues for the study of the pathogenesis and protective immunity in cryptosporidial infection.\r"

All five jirds inoculated orally with strain UNO:0487:1 (UNO) became infected and began excreting cysts 3-6 days post-infection (dpi); no cysts were detected between 8-12 dpi after which time cysts were produced through day 19. Four of the five jirds infected with Strain ATCC:30957 (WB) and three of the five jirds infected with strain CDC:0284:1 (VA) excreted cysts from 6-20 dpi and 6-22 dpi, respectively. One of five jirds inoculated with EGY excreted cysts on 8 dpi only. At necropsy, trophozoites were recovered from only three UNO-infected jirds but from all WB- and VA-infected jirds that excreted cysts. The one jird which excreted cysts of EGY was negative at necropsy, but EGY trophozoites were found in one non-patient jird. Isoelectric focusing indicated that these four strains of G. lamblia represented three zymodemes. WB and VA were assigned to one zymodeme, EGY to a second, and UNO, which shared common bands with both other zymodemes, to the third. Although the similarities and differences in infectivity and cyst excretion patterns appear to coincide with the zymodemes to which the strains can be assigned, further study is needed to examine the parasitologic behavior of these strains in relation to isoenzyme patterns.\r"

  ".W": "Weekly oral chloroquine prophylaxis for malaria has been associated with impaired antibody response to intradermal rabies vaccination. Experimental data indicate that chloroquine may inhibit yellow fever virus in vitro, yet there has been no clinical evidence to suggest that antibody response to yellow fever vaccine is impaired by concomitant oral administration of chloroquine. A prospective trial was undertaken to evaluate the antibody response to yellow fever 17D vaccine (Connaught Laboratories) of volunteers who were randomized to taking either chloroquine or no drug. Of fifty subjects, 28 were randomized to taking chloroquine, 22 were randomized to taking no drug. Yellow fever 17D vaccine was administered on day 0 and blood sampled on days 0, 14, 35 and 210. Chloroquine was administered weekly for four weeks. There was no significant difference in peak antibody titer by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) between the group that took chloroquine (mean log peak of reciprocal titer 1.43 +/- SD 0.60) with vaccine subcutaneously compared to vaccine-only group (mean log peak of reciprocal titer = 1.21 +/- 0.55). All fifty subjects seroconverted to yellow fever vaccine by day 210. ELISA testing was also performed on all subjects. The two tests showed good correlation (Spearman r = 0.675), although ELISA readings were positive by day 14 in significantly more subjects (p = .01). We conclude that routine anti-malarial doses of chloroquine do not affect antibody response to yellow fever 17D vaccine. ELISA testing, a less complex and less time-consuming test, correlates well with PRNT and is proposed for additional trials to measure yellow fever 17D vaccine response in flavivirus non-immune subjects.\r"

The adrenal CT showed unilateral lesions in two cases and bilateral in another four. The US study showed more frequent alterations, unilateral in seven and bilateral in three subjects. Combining both methods increased the sensitivity to 85% of the cases. All patients had normal plasma cortisol concentrations and normal or increased urinary cortisol excretion. Plasma aldosterone concentration was also normal except in one patient with hypokalemia. Seven patients showed diminished cortisol responses, five had subnormal aldosterone responses and in five plasma aldosterone concentration increased more than normally after stimulation by ACTH. There was an incidence of limited adrenal reserve in 53% of the patients on ACTH stimulation. No correlation was evident between the disorders in adrenal steroid responses to ACTH and changes in morphology revealed by CT and/or US.\r"

There were 10 patients in each group, who were kept sitting for 2 minutes after injection. The maximum level of sensory blockade was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the group who received the solution adjusted to 37 degrees C, and variability of level was smaller (p less than 0.05). Time to two-segment regression was shorter in the 37 degrees C group than in the 4 degrees C group (p less than 0.05). Hypotension required administration of ephedrine more often in the 37 degrees C group (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the use of plain bupivacaine 0.5% adjusted to 37 degrees C results in a higher and more predictable sensory blockade.\r"

Their experiments indicated many of the properties of the drug, but its clinical usage remained very limited and was reserved for cases of tetanus, hydrophobia and strychnine poisoning. Griffith and Johnson are usually credited with the introduction of curare into clinical anaesthesia in 1942, but a Dr F.P. de Caux working at the North Middlesex Hospital, London, in 1928 utilised curare in a series of seven patients. His work was not widely publicized and this contribution to anaesthetic history has been overlooked by subsequent authors.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six servicemen were anaesthetised using the Triservice anaesthetic apparatus. They were allocated randomly into one of two groups, to breathe spontaneously or to receive artificial ventilation, and into subgroups who were given air alone, or air supplemented with 1 or 4 litres/minute of oxygen. A further 12 subjects were studied subsequently using 0.5 litres/minute of added oxygen. Intra-operative blood gases were compared with those of awake premedicated controls. Artificial ventilation was associated with an unchanged arterial oxygen tension with air alone; in the other subgroups arterial oxygen tension was higher than with spontaneous respiration when related to inspired oxygen fraction (p less than 0.05). Air anaesthesia caused significant hypoxaemia with spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.05), and 50% of the subjects required assisted ventilation. There was also a significant respiratory acidosis (p less than 0.05). Intermittent positive pressure ventilation is the method of choice for field anaesthesia when oxygen is unavailable. Spontaneous respiration must be supplemented with at least 0.5 litres minute of oxygen.\r"

Age was an important influence on the induction dose of propofol (r = -0.34) which was also closely related to ASA grade. Induction of anaesthesia with propofol is dependent on a number of variables, and this study suggests that pre-operative albumin and urea concentrations are important.\r"

There was uniform adherence to a rigid anaesthetic protocol up to and including 1985, but a much publicized incident reported from the courtroom stimulated a relaxation of this regimen. Consequently the incidence of awareness decreased from 1.3% to 0.4%, and the incidence of dreaming was also reduced. Recollections of surgery were confined to manipulations, noises and voices. None of our patients complained of pain at the time of interview, although one since has. The inadequacies of the initial protocol and an approach to informed consent are discussed.\r"

A retrospective audit was therefore carried out on 434 coagulation screens requested for pre-eclamptic patients in whom epidural analgesia might have been considered. Borderline abnormalities of coagulation were found in only 10 patients (2%). Platelet counts of less than 150 x 10(9)/litre were present in 28% of cases. 'Significant' thrombocytopenia (less than 100 x 10(9)/litre) and all coagulation abnormalities were only encountered in severe pre-eclampsia (diastolic blood pressure of greater than 110 mmHg and proteinuria of + + or greater). Furthermore, coagulation abnormality was always associated with a reduced platelet count (mean, 97 x 10(9)/litre). This study would therefore support anaesthetic practice which restricted any requests for coagulation testing to severe pre-eclamptic patients only. For these patients first line testing could be limited to a platelet count.\r"

DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 141 consecutive trauma patients who had F/E views performed after a routine cervical-spine series (three views) was obtained in the emergency department. Interpretations of the routine series were compared with those of the F/E views to determine if additional useful information was provided by the latter. The charts also were reviewed to determine if any variables were associated with an increased use of F/E views, an increased likelihood of these views demonstrating instability, or any neurologic sequelae resulted from these studies. SETTING: An urban Level I adult trauma center. MEASUREMENTS: The interpretations of the routine series were noted to be either normal, abnormal but without demonstrable fracture/dislocation, or demonstrating a fracture/dislocation. The F/E views were categorized as stable, unstable, or uninterpretable. RESULTS: Cervical-spine instability was demonstrated by F/E views in 11 of the 141 patients (8%), four of whom had normal routine cervical-spine films. Three of these four patients required surgical stabilization. Prolonged neck pain (more than 24 hours), an initially abnormal spine series, and a neurosurgical consult were all associated with an increased use of F/E views. Ten of 11 patients with radiographic instability had significant neck pain by history; the remaining patient was intoxicated. No neurologic sequelae resulted from performing F/E studies. There was one false-negative F/E study, which raises concern about the reliability of this procedure in the ED. CONCLUSION: We believe that a large prospective study is required to determine which patients warrant F/E views.\r"

There was no difference in Boehler's angle between male and female subjects (P greater than .05) or between left and right feet (P greater than .05). Slight variations in central beam location for ankle and foot radiographs had no significant effect on Boehler's angle. CONCLUSION: If 28 degrees is taken as the lower limit of normal for Boehler's angle, 37 cases (31%) would be false-positive \"abnormal.\" The use of 20 degrees as the lower limit may decrease the number of false-positive to three cases (2.5%); using 18 degrees (mean -2 SD) reduces the false-positive rate to less than 1% (one case).\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if the risk of relapse correlates with the clinical features of the disease. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-two patients with documented COPD who were treated for dyspnea in the ED of the Albuquerque Veterans Administration Medical Center over a three-year period. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features and pulmonary function tests of the patients, who were considered to have COPD if the baseline prebronchodilator one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was less than 80% predicted, and less than 80% of the forced vital capacity and inhaled bronchodilators failed to increase the FEV1 to levels of more than 80% predicted. Visits for pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary emboli were excluded. A relapse was defined as an unscheduled revisit to the ED within 14 days of initial treatment. Data were entered into a microcomputer data base and analyzed by a commercial statistical package. RESULTS: Of 877 visits in which the patient was treated and released from the ED, 281 (32.0%) resulted in relapse and were considered unsuccessful Compared with successful visits, unsuccessful visits were characterized by a shorter duration of dyspnea (P = .002), a lower entry FEV1 (P = .027), a lower discharge FEV1 (P = .040), a greater number of treatments with nebulized bronchodilators (P = .009), more frequent use of parenteral adrenergic drugs (P = .006), and less frequent use of oral prednisone on discharge (P = .016). Patients with one or more relapse visits during the study period (relapsers) differed from nonrelapsers in several respects. Relapsers had a greater bronchodilator response on baseline FEV1 than nonrelapsers (P = .047). Nevertheless, relapsers required more bronchodilator treatments in the ED (P less than .001); were treated more frequently with parenteral adrenergic drugs (P less than .001), IV glucocorticoids (P less than .001), and oral prednisone (P less than .001); and recovered less of their baseline FEV1 (P less than .014). CONCLUSION: Bronchodilator response on baseline pulmonary function testing appears to identify patients with COPD who have a poor prognosis after emergency treatment. Their poor response to intensive bronchodilator treatment suggests that loss of bronchodilator response may be involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory decompensation.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled clinical trial. SETTING: The ED of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, a publicly subsidized, 450-bed, acute care hospital staffed by residents and faculty of the University of Tennessee, Memphis. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Rotating housestaff treating adult ED patients with a wide variety of medical and surgical problems. INTERVENTION: Introduction of a portable pulse oximeter for noninvasive measurement of blood oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS: Rates of ABG test ordering, housestaff reason(s) for ordering an ABG, and the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes before and after introduction of portable pulse oximetry. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 20,120 patient visits occurred during the four-month study. Before oximeter introduction, emergency physicians ordered 699 ABGs, 63% of which were indicated by explicit criteria. After oximeter introduction, 440 ABGs were ordered (a 37% decrease). Almost all of this decrease was due to fewer ABGs ordered to assess oxygenation (260 before vs 75 after; chi 2, P less than .001). These reductions were not explained by differences in total patient visits or case mix. Physicians decreased ordering of indicated ABGs by almost as great an extent as they reduced ordering of unindicated tests, suggesting they did not consistently distinguish between the two. However, decreased testing did not result in any serious adverse outcomes, defined as unanticipated respiratory or cardiac arrest in the ED, unanticipated arrest on the floor within 24 hours of admission, or death within two days of hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Portable pulse oximetry can provide a simple, noninvasive way to determine oxygen saturation in the ED. Routine use of portable pulse oximetry may substantially reduce rates of ABG testing and associated patient charges without adversely affecting the quality of emergency care.\r"

METHODS: Animals received intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (10, 20, 35, or 50 mg/kg), lidocaine (30 or 40 mg/kg), or a combination of all doses of cocaine given simultaneously with 30 or 40 mg/kg lidocaine. The incidence and time to seizure and death were recorded in these groups and compared by chi 2 and analysis of variance analyses, respectively. RESULTS: At doses of 30 or 40 mg/kg, lidocaine does not induce seizures or death. The effect of simultaneous injection of both cocaine and lidocaine was to dramatically increase the incidence of both seizures and death over that of cocaine alone. The incidence of seizures in animals receiving 35 mg/kg cocaine alone was 10%; this increased to 50% and 80% with the addition of 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine, respectively (P less than or equal to .05; P less than or equal to .01). Death did not occur in animals receiving 35 mg/kg cocaine alone; the addition of 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine resulted in death in 30% and 60% of animals, respectively (P less than or equal to .01 each group). Similarly, in rats receiving 50 mg/kg cocaine, the incidence of death increased from 0% to 60% and 80% with 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine, respectively (P less than or equal to .01). CONCLUSION: In the rat, overall toxicity of cocaine is significantly increased with simultaneous exposure to lidocaine.\r"

Cardiac rhythm and vital signs were monitored throughout and after infusion. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Group 2 demonstrated significantly more cardiovascular side effects (hypotension and bradycardia) than did group 1 (Fisher's exact test, P less than .05). CONCLUSION: Phenytoin provided adequate seizure control in both groups. For individuals with ASCVD, IV phenytoin administration rates should not exceed 25 mg/min. For individuals without ASCVD, phenytoin administration at 50 mg/min appears safe and without significant cardiovascular side effects.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, crossover study. SETTING: The Massachusetts Poison Control Center office in The Children's Hospital, Boston. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Six healthy adult volunteers with no known allergies to aspirin or chocolate, bleeding disorders, or peptic ulcer disease. INTERVENTIONS: Each participant ingested 975 mg of crushed aspirin on separate days, followed by either water; 10 g milk chocolate-charcoal mixture; 10 g SuperChar Liquid; or 10 g Actidose Aqua activated charcoal. Total serum salicylate concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography at zero, one, two, four, eight, and 24 hours after ingestion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neuman-Keuls analysis was used to measure time-to-peak concentration, which was reduced by SuperChar Liquid, 67%; milk chocolate-charcoal mixture, 106%; and activated charcoal, 56%. Aspirin absorption was calculated using Neuman-Keuls analysis to measure area under the concentration-time curve. Total aspirin absorption was reduced by SuperChar, 67%; milk chocolate-charcoal mixture, 50%; and activated charcoal, 2%. There was no difference in serum salicylate concentrations between SuperChar and milk chocolate-charcoal mixture at all time intervals. Also, all serum salicylate concentrations with milk chocolate-charcoal mixture were consistently lower than with activated charcoal. CONCLUSION: Although the formulation of milk chocolate with activated charcoal reduces its adsorptive capacity compared with superactivated charcoal, it is still able to bind aspirin effectively and is superior to conventional activated charcoal. Further research may improve the binding and palatability of milk chocolate-charcoal mixture, especially for home use.\r"

This study was designed to assess current emergency physician use of available resources. DESIGN: Prospective evaluation by mail using a 49-item questionnaire. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All 170 emergency physicians in Utah. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: The response rate was 75.3% (128 of 170). Resources \"outside their own fund of knowledge\" were consulted \"occasionally\" to \"frequently\" by 98.3%. They used the following resources \"occasionally\" to \"frequently\": poison control center (PCC) (93.7%), toxicology textbook (77.6%), \"expert colleague\" (34.0%), and \"in-house POISINDEX\" (23.9%). They often contacted the PCC for toxicity information (93.7%) and management recommendations (87.3%) and for acute, symptomatic overdose cases (88.3%). They \"almost never\" contacted the PCC for adverse drug reactions (76.6%), pill identification (70.2%), consultation with physician toxicologist (68.1%), asymptomatic exposures (62.9%), chronic toxicity (50.4%), or solely to report the case to the American Association of Poison Control Centers data base (90.2%). Those who had access to in-house POISINDEX often did not consult the PCC (82.6%). Of those who did not have in-house POISINDEX, 42.8% contacted the PCC to access it. Providing access to physician toxicologist consultations was thought to be an important role for the PCC by 86.7%, but only 32% of physicians were using this option. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of emergency physicians in Utah consult the PCC only for acute, symptomatic overdoses. They view access to physician toxicologist consultation as an important role for the PCC but seldom use it. The availability of in-house POISINDEX decreases the likelihood of PCC consultations from emergency departments. The frequency of emergency physician consultation with the PCC may decrease as POISINDEX becomes available at more hospitals.\r"

DESIGN: A one-year retrospective analysis was performed on all patients who were admitted to an urban trauma center with a discharge diagnosis of multiple trauma and who received a comprehensive toxicology screening test. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven of the 177 patients (72%) who fulfilled the criteria had positive toxicology screens. Ethyl alcohol was the only drug present in 26 of these patients (20%); 57 (45%) were positive for drugs other than ethyl alcohol. A combination of ethyl alcohol and at least one other drug was quantified in 44 patients (35%). The most often encountered substances were ethyl alcohol (55%), marijuana (24%), and cocaine (21%). Twelve drug screens (9%) demonstrated pharmaceuticals (eg, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, or cyclic antidepressants) that may require specific antidotal treatment. CONCLUSION: The ingestant profile found in this subgroup of trauma patients differed from those of previous studies. Although a select group of these ingestants requires specific treatment or affects the physical assessment of the patient, none of these trauma patients received more than supportive care.\r"

STUDY POPULATION: A prospective, convenience sample of patients presenting to the emergency department of a large inner-city hospital with complaints related to cocaine use were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had other potential causes of elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels or rhabdomyolysis. A control group comprised patients who were not cocaine users and satisfied the exclusion criteria. Sixty-eight patients were studied. METHODS: Initial evaluation included determination of the presence of muscle pain or swelling and total CK levels. Patients with a CK level of more than 800 U/L had additional tests, including a urine myoglobin, urine drug screen, and serum phosphorus. Rhabdomyolysis was defined by a serum CK level of more than 1,000 U/L (more than fivefold that of normal). CK levels were compared by two-tailed Student's t test. Muscle symptoms were compared with the development of rhabdomyolysis by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The CK level in the cocaine group was 931 +/- 1,785 U/L (mean +/- 1 SD). The CK level in the control group was 242 +/- 168 U/L (P = .028). Of the cocaine users, 24% (eight of 34) had rhabdomyolysis; one developed multiorgan failure and died. No patient in the control group had a CK level of more than 1,000 U/L. Only one cocaine user who developed rhabdomyolysis had muscle symptoms. Three cocaine users had muscle symptoms but did not develop rhabdomyolysis. No patient in the control group had muscle symptoms or developed rhabdomyolysis. Muscle symptoms did not predict the CK level (P = .55). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that 24% of the cocaine users had rhabdomyolysis. Many of the cases of rhabdomyolysis were not predictable from history or physical examination, making laboratory evaluation essential.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to isolate significant clinical or demographic findings concerning overdose patients treated during a China White (3-methyl fentanyl) epidemic and compare them with data for all unintentional narcotic overdose patients during a 24-month period. DESIGN: We reviewed charts from 85,246 patient visits to our emergency department during the 24-month period of January 1987 through December 1988 to study this narcotic epidemic. Data from the Allegheny County Coroner's Office pertaining to unintentional drug overdose deaths that occurred during this same period also were reviewed. SETTING: The first outbreak of narcotic overdoses in the eastern United States involving China White occurred in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, in 1988. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if they met the criteria of a suspected unintentional narcotic overdose, but excluded if they were not given naloxone. INTERVENTIONS: Emergency physicians became suspicious of China White use after an unusual increase in narcotic overdoses presenting to the ED coupled with \"routine drug of abuse\" screens negative for opiates despite dramatic patient responses to naloxone. In most of the cases in which specific testing was done, there were positive indicators of fentanyl derivatives. Investigations found China White present in street drugs and paraphernalia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A cluster was defined as a time period with a statistically significant increase in overdoses over the expected number for an interval of equal length. Although there were no significant clinical differences in case presentation during the 24-month period, there was a statistically significant 13-fold increase in overdoses during the September through November 1988 cluster (mean, 13 vs 0.95 per month, P less than .001 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test). A dramatic increase in unintentional drug overdose deaths occurred in the county during this cluster. A total of 18 fentanyl-positive unintentional drug overdose deaths, predominantly male (89%) and black (56%), with an age range of 19 to 44 years (mean, 34.9 years), were reported by the county coroner (13 during the cluster). Narcotic overdoses and unintentional drug overdose deaths declined sharply with confiscation of a clandestine China White laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: China White was responsible for a dramatic rise in unintentional drug overdose deaths in Allegheny County in 1988. There were no significant clinical differences between China White overdose survivors and other unintentional narcotic overdose victims. Overdoses responsive to naloxone with inconsistent routine toxicologic screens may be due to a fentanyl analogue.\r"

  ".U": "91144167\r", 
  ".W": "Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects of benzodiazepines. It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand, studies are inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent. Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does not produce serious adverse effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Repeat doses can be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration; should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First, it could be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures, particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second, flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of this new agent.\r"

DESIGN: Ten pieces of beef were sliced into cubes approximately 6 cm on each side. Six different groups of foreign bodies were examined: gravel, cactus spine, glass, metal, wood, and plastic. An independent observer placed the objects in a random fashion into the beef cubes. One hundred twenty observations were made using sets of ten beef cubes at a time. Five foreign bodies were placed into each set of ten beef cubes. INTERVENTIONS: A blinded emergency physician used a portable ultrasound with a 7.5-MHz transducer to determine the presence or absence of a foreign body in each cube. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ultrasound detected 59 of 60 foreign bodies, including all cubes of meat embedded with gravel, cactus spine, plastic, metal, and wood. Glass was detected nine of ten times. Of the 60 cubes of meat with no foreign bodies, one false-positive was recorded. This yielded sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 98%. Positive determinations by ultrasound were significantly greater in the meat cubes with foreign bodies compared with the control group with no foreign bodies (P less than .001 by chi 2). Although the subset of glass foreign bodies had one false-positive and one false-negative, it was not significantly different in comparison with the other groups (P greater than .05 by chi 2). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has promise as a diagnostic tool for the detection of a variety of foreign bodies. Further clinical studies using ultrasound for the detection of foreign bodies are warranted.\r"

At 15 minutes of VF-TCA, 89% of animals had myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels above 20% of control and adenylate charge ratio above 0.60. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, all animals had adenosine triphosphate levels below 10% of control and adenylate charge ratio below 0.30. In addition, myocardial lactate levels plateaued after 30 minutes of VF-TCA, indicating the cessation of lactate production. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the myocardium can tolerate VF-TCA for as long as 15 minutes without irreversible injury; however, post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction may occur after as little as five minutes of VF-TCA. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial injury is likely to be irreversible.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory investigation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one swine weighing 10 to 12 kg, anesthetized with ketamine and alpha-chloralose and ventilated with room air. INTERVENTIONS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced with 90 V of 60 Hz current delivered to the right ventricle by transvenous pacemaker. Blood samples for epinephrine were drawn before arrest and every two minutes thereafter. At five minutes, external mechanical cardiac compressions were initiated. Nine animals received no further therapy and served as controls. Two groups of six animals received either 0.01 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg of epinephrine through the endotracheal tube at ten and 20 minutes. Blood samples were assayed for epinephrine. MEASUREMENTS: Arterial blood pressure, lead II ECG, and plasma epinephrine. MAIN RESULTS: Swine receiving epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg had an increase in epinephrine levels after drug administration, but these were not significantly different from control levels. The 0.1-mg/kg dose group had a significant increase in plasma epinephrine levels compared with controls and the 0.01-mg/kg dose group after receiving epinephrine at ten and 20 minutes. These increases were from 14 +/- 3 to 215 +/- 40 ng/mL (+/- SEM) at 12 minutes after arrest and from 151 +/- 56 to 402 +/- 80 ng/mL at 22 minutes after arrest. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that standard dosing of epinephrine through the endotracheal tube during arrest does not produce significant increases in plasma catecholamines or blood pressure. Epinephrine 0.1 mg/kg produces a significant increase in plasma epinephrine levels, but it is not sufficient to produce a significant change in blood pressure.\r"

DESIGN/INTERVENTIONS: 21 healthy mongrel dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital, intubated, and mechanically supported. They were instrumented to measure heart rate, arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure, cardiac output, and arterial and mixed venous blood gases. The dogs were then subjected to a protocol that consisted of three successive CPR episodes. During each episode they were treated with repeated injections of one of the three substances, randomly chosen. After two minutes of ventricular fibrillation and four minutes of electromechanical dissociation, CPR was started with a thumper (rate, 60; duty cycle, 50%). If recovery was not obtained after five minutes of CPR, 1 mEq/kg carbicarb or sodium bicarbonate or 5 mL D5W was injected in the right atrium. Half the dose of the same substance was injected every five minutes thereafter; 1 mg epinephrine was also injected every five minutes until recovery. Hemodynamic and gasometric evaluations were performed five and 20 minutes after recovery. This later evaluation served as baseline for the next CPR episode. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The duration and success rates of CPR are similar in the three CPR groups. Hemodynamic parameters were also similar during recovery. Bicarbicarb and sodium bicarbonate increased bicarbonate levels and corrected pH in the arterial and mixed venous blood. There was no difference in the blood gas values after carbicarb and sodium bicarbonate. CONCLUSION: In this model of cardiac arrest, carbicarb was not superior to sodium bicarbonate in the correction of metabolic acidosis during CPR.\r"

DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: Dogs were randomly assigned to undergo adrenalectomy or sham-operation. Some adrenalectomized animals received an epinephrine infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the seven sham-operated dogs, the plasma epinephrine concentrations increased markedly during BLS as expected. In the seven adrenalectomized dogs receiving a constant infusion of epinephrine, cardiopulmonary arrest and BLS induced a three to sixfold increase in plasma epinephrine concentrations, with an increase in the mean plasma epinephrine concentrations (calculated from the area under the curve) of 1.21 +/- 0.12 ng/mL (P less than .05). In the seven adrenalectomized dogs receiving a constant epinephrine infusion but not subjected to cardiopulmonary arrest, the plasma epinephrine concentrations remained stable. Finally, in the seven adrenalectomized dogs not receiving an epinephrine infusion, the mean plasma epinephrine concentrations during BLS (calculated from the area under the curve) increased only by 0.05 +/- 0.04 ng/mL, significantly less than in adrenalectomized dogs receiving an epinephrine infusion (P less than .01). CONCLUSION: The increase in plasma epinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary arrest and BLS is due in part to an altered disposition of epinephrine.\r"

CASES AND SETTING: Seven hundred thirty patients with AMS who received naloxone for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes at the discretion of two large, urban, paramedic base teaching hospitals. METHODS: We reviewed paramedic run sheets and audiotapes on all 730 patients as well as available hospital records of all patients who demonstrated any response to naloxone to determine whether overdose was responsible for their clinical presentations. We also reviewed hospital records for a selected sample of naloxone nonresponders. MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Only 25 patients (3.4%) demonstrated a complete response to naloxone, whereas 32 (4.4%) manifested a partial or equivocal response. Nineteen of 25 complete responders (76%), two of 26 partial responders (8%) (with known final diagnosis), and four of 195 non-responders (2%) (with known final diagnosis) were ultimately diagnosed as having overdosed. Respirations of 12 or less or the presence of any one of the three clinical findings as a group were each highly sensitive in predicting response to naloxone, and at least as sensitive as response to naloxone in predicting a diagnosis of opiate overdose. Selective administration of naloxone for AMS would have decreased the use of this drug by 75% to 90% while still administering it to virtually all naloxone responders who had a final diagnosis of opiate overdose.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of all patients with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis seen during a three-year period. SETTING: Emergency department observation unit of an urban teaching hospital serving residents of the city and county of Denver. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Women between the ages of 15 and 50 with symptoms, physical examination, and initial laboratory data consistent with a diagnosis of pyelonephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received IV antibiotics, rehydration, analgesics, and antiemetics in an observation unit for up to 12 hours, when they were either admitted to the hospital or discharged home on oral antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-three of 87 patients (72%) with acute pyelonephritis were managed successfully as outpatients, nine (22%) were hospitalized directly from the observation unit because they were considered to be too ill to go home, and five (6%) returned with persistent symptoms after ED therapy and were hospitalized.

RESULTS: During CPR performance, mean oxygen consumption (0.36 +/- 0.10 L/min), and mean minute volume (21.9 +/- 6.0 L/min) were 16% and 26%, respectively, of the levels reached during a maximum exercise test. Systolic blood pressure (153 +/- 23 mm Hg) and heart rate (132 +/- 25 beats/min) were 75% and 73%, respectively, of the levels reached during a maximum exercise test. Serum lactate levels at rest and after CPR performance were not significantly different (1.08 +/- 0.99 vs 1.54 +/- 1.03 mEq/L). Valsalva reflex remained present throughout total CPR time at varying degrees depending on individual differences in CPR technique (eg, incomplete extension of the manikin's head, holding the breath during chest compression).

TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All violent incidents involving patients/visitors and ED staff that triggered a police response to the ED area were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All ED violent episodes were recorded and categorized by shift, type of incident, type of police response, perpetrator, and site of incident. It was found that police responded to the ED nearly twice daily; the night shift had 32% of the cases with only 13% of the patient volume; custody and medical psychiatric clearance patients accounted for 40% of the cases; more than 20% of incidents occurred in the waiting room; and 4.2% of the incidents represented a significant threat to ED staff. CONCLUSION: ED violence is a significant and under-reported problem at our medium-sized university teaching hospital. These data are useful in objectively quantifying the scope of violence in our institution, and they underscore the potential risk to emergency patients, visitors, and staff. There is an acute need for additional studies in other settings so that appropriate and cost-effective security recommendations can be formulated.\r"

Although EDs are organized around the goals of rapid patient assessment, stabilization, and prompt admission to the hospital, an increasing number are being required to hold admitted floor and critical care patients for extended periods due to lack of vacant inpatient beds. Provision of acceptable patient care under such circumstances requires a fundamental reordering of ED priorities and procedures. Overcrowding is the result of inadequate funding for emergency health care services during a period of increasing demand. The initial focus of management strategies to resolve this problem is the inpatient area and includes evaluation of length of stay, \"intent to discharge\" policies, flexible bed designations, restriction of in-house transfers, and the use of \"over-census beds.\" If in-hospital management strategies fail, modifications in ED management may include staffing contingency plans, definition of physician responsibility, inpatient charts, revised pharmacy formulary, new floor plans, and modified accounting systems. Successful resolution of hospital and ED overcrowding may be the greatest challenge facing emergency medicine today.\r"

METHODS: Telephone survey of written thrombolytic protocols, with comparison of groups using Kruskal-Wallis test (P less than .05). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary modes of initiating thrombolytic therapy are at the emergency physician's discretion (32%). after private physician consultation (24%), through the use of an agreement developed by the emergency physicians in conjunction with cardiologists or internists (22%), or after cardiologist or internist consultation (22%). ECG interpretation before drug administration is most often performed by the emergency physician (41%), cardiologist or internist (28%), private physician (6%), or computer (10%). Both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and streptokinase are available at 50 hospitals (75%); tPA is used exclusively in ten (15%) and streptokinase in seven (10%) other hospitals. tPA and streptokinase are approved for ED use in 43 (72%) and 46 (81%), respectively, of the hospitals at which these agents are available. In these, the ED is the most frequent site of administration of tPA in only 28 (65%) and of streptokinase in 33 (72%) hospitals; tPA and streptokinase are kept in the ED in only 23 (53%) and 23 (50%) of these hospitals, respectively.

DESIGN: Self-administered survey. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: The ED directors of 71 emergency medicine training programs, 82 Michigan community EDs, and 56 pediatric EDs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred eighteen (58%) surveys were returned. A median of five unaccompanied minors (range 0.2 to 150) were seen weekly by responding EDs. Pediatric EDs saw the most unaccompanied minors weekly (ten) compared with training programs (five) and community EDs (three) (P less than .01). Emergency medicine training programs had the greatest percentage (3.0%) of minors who were unaccompanied compared with pediatric EDs (2.2%) and community EDs (2.6%) (P less than .05). For all conditions surveyed, only 3.8% of patients would be refused medical care without parental consent. However, 36.8% of patients would have medical care delayed even for conditions that might be painful or harmful if left untreated for some time. Most EDs (85.5%) screen patients and treat those who are acutely ill, but some (11.1%) treat all regardless of severity. CONCLUSION: Protocols should be developed for unaccompanied minors to ensure that delays in obtaining consent do not jeopardize the child and that the rights of minors for confidentiality and consent are recognized.\r"

These events are part of a pattern of increasing regulation of the practice of medicine. Physicians and hospital administrators responsible for hospital transfer policies should be aware of regulatory developments. Hospitals contemplating transfer of patients must develop transfer policies that comply with governing law, including state law. A transfer policy should provide guidelines as to when a patient is \"stable for transfer\". Patients may not be transferred unless a physician can certify that delay attendant to transfer will not be detrimental.

As compared with the control subjects (n = 14), mean activity of 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase was normal in cerebellar cortex from the patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy, whereas quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase activity was markedly increased (+92%, p less than 0.02). No significant changes in enzyme activities were found in samples from occipital cortex. Increased quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase activity may represent a mechanism, in the degenerating cerebellum, to protect quinolinic acid-sensitive granule cells in patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy.\r"

Urine samples were collected from 70 neurologically normal subjects ranging in age from 1 month to 68 years. By using this sensitive two-site radiometric immunosorbent assay, NGF-Rt levels were found to be highest in urine from 1-month old subjects. By 2.5 months, NGF-Rt values were half of those seen at 1 month and decreased more gradually between 0.5 and 15 years. Between 15 and 68 years, urine NGF-Rt levels were relatively constant at 5% of 1-month values. No evidence for diurnal variation of adult NGF-Rt was apparent. Pregnant women in their third trimester showed significantly elevated urine NGF-Rt values compared with age-matched normals. Affinity labeling of NGF-Rt with 125I-NGF followed by immunoprecipitation with ME20.4-IgG and gel autoradiography indicated that neonatal urine contained high amounts of truncated receptor (Mr = 50 kd); decreasingly lower amounts of NGF-Rt were observed on gel autoradiograms with development, indicating that the two-site radiometric immunosorbent assay correlated well with the affinity labeling technique for measuring NGF-Rt. NGF-Rt in urines from 1-month-old and 36-year-old subjects showed no differences in affinities for NGF or for the monoclonal antibody IIIG5. These data show that NGF-Rt is developmentally regulated in human urine, and are discussed in relation to the development and maturation of the peripheral nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Critical flicker fusion thresholds were normal, relative to age-matched healthy subjects. For color, the majority of the errors were tritanomalous (blue axis). Color and stereoacuity deficits were unrelated to severity of dementia, in accordance with models of vision that describe these functions as modular rather than diffuse for cortical localization. Although contrast sensitivity was depressed throughout the frequency range in AD, more patients were impaired at low than at high spatial frequencies, contrasting with the observed normal aging pattern of high-frequency loss. Healthy elderly subjects showed depressed critical flicker fusion thresholds and reduced contrast sensitivity at high frequencies, relative to the young group; differences between these groups were not found for the other vision tests. A subset of the AD group received detailed neuro-ophthalmological examination, and no abnormalities were found. This finding, taken together with normal thresholds for critical flicker fusion, suggests that the widespread visual dysfunction reported here is more likely to be related to known pathological changes in primary visual and association cortex in AD than to changes in the retina or optic nerve.\r"

In the present study, 24 patients, matched for age, sex, duration of disease, and disability, had serial gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI over a 6-month period. The 12 patients in the secondary progressive group had a total of 109 new lesions over this time (18.2 lesions per patient per year) and 87% of these enhanced. Enhancement also occurred within and at the edge of preexisting lesions. In contrast, only 20 new lesions were seen in the primary progressive group (3.3 lesions per patient per year) and only one of these enhanced. There was no difference in the degree of clinical deterioration between the two groups over the 6-month period. These findings may indicate a difference in the dynamics of disease activity between the two forms of progressive MS, particularly in relation to the inflammatory component of the lesions, and have important implications for the selection of patients and the monitoring of disease activity in therapeutic trials.\r"

Two tests of manual dexterity of the same hand also were studied: the Purdue pegboard test, and the maximal frequency of a scissors movement of the thumb and index finger. The patients had normal strength or minimal weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand on clinical examination. The mean central motor conduction times for the adductor pollicis muscle for the patients were longer than normal, the peak twitch force of the adductor pollicis muscle evoked by cortical stimulation and the maximum force of a phasic voluntary contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle were smaller than normal. There were strong correlations between all these measures. Central motor conduction time in the patients was inversely correlated with voluntary phasic force and the twitch force after cortical stimulation. That is, the longer the central motor conduction time, the weaker the force. Prolonged central motor conduction time is likely to be accompanied by conduction block in corticomotoneuron pathways. The correlation of central motor conduction time with voluntary phasic force and the twitch force most likely reflects the degree of conduction block and temporal dispersion rather than delay in conduction per se. These results indicate that objective assessments of phasic muscle strength may reveal correlations with central motor conduction time that are not evident on conventional clinical examination which assesses tonic muscle contraction strength.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each patient had 6 measurements of cerebral blood flow by positron tomography with 2 scans at rest, 2 during movement of fingers of the recovered hand, and 2 during movement of fingers of the normal hand. When the normal fingers were moved, regional cerebral blood flow increased significantly in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. When the fingers of the recovered hand were moved, significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were observed in both contralateral and ipsilateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in both cerebellar hemispheres. Other regions, namely, insula, inferior parietal, and premotor cortex, were also bilaterally activated with movement of the recovered hand. We have also demonstrated, by using a new technique of image analysis, different functional connections between the thalamic nuclei and specific cortical and cerebellar regions during these movements. Our results suggest that ipsilateral motor pathways may play a role in the recovery of motor function after ischemic stroke.\r"

(2) The syndromes are not restricted to lower motor neuron disorders; 8 of 9 patients had definite or probable upper motor neuron signs as well, qualifying for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Corticospinal tracts were affected in both postmortem examinations. (3) The combination of motor neuron disease and lymphoma is often accompanied by paraproteinemia (3 of 7 patients studied), increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content (6 of 9 patients), and cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (3 of 9 patients). (4) In 2 patients, asymptomatic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found only because the discovery of paraproteinemia gave impetus to examine the bone marrow. (5) Patients with both upper and lower motor neuron signs (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) may show physiological evidence of conduction block in peripheral nerves or autopsy abnormalities in peripheral nerves. The cause of this syndrome is not known. Both lymphoma and motor neuron disease could have a common cause, possibly a retroviral infection. The frequency of paraproteinemia suggests that an immunological disorder may play a role in the pathogenesis of the neurological disorder.\r"

Taxol is also cytotoxic to dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro, but this effect is prevented by cotreatment with the trophic protein, nerve growth factor. We sought to develop an animal model and then to determine whether nerve growth factor can prevent taxol neuropathy in vivo. Administration of taxol to mice resulted in a profound sensory neuropathy characterized by decreases in dorsal root ganglion content of the peptide neurotransmitter, substance P, elevated threshold to thermally induced pain, and diminished amplitude of the compound action potential in the caudal nerve. Coadministration of nerve growth factor prevented all of these signs of neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that administration of nerve growth factor may prevent certain toxic sensory neuropathies.\r"

  ".W": "Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is the treatment of choice in aborting the acute attack of migraine. Although its efficacy has been known for 40 years, its mechanism of action is still disputed. Data regarding the site of action of dihydroergotamine may provide an insight into its mechanism of action and thus identify a locus of potentially abnormal pathophysiology in migraine. By using in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographic techniques, the localization of specific binding sites for 3H-dihydroergotamine in the cat brain has been examined. Binding was seen in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord, in the medulla, associated with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, area postrema, and descending spinal trigeminal nucleus, and in the mesencephalon and the cerebral cortex. The highest density of binding sites was found in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei of the midbrain. Furthermore, these same brain regions were also labeled after intravenous administration of 3H-dihydroergotamine. It is important that the brain areas specifically labeled are key nuclei involved in cranial pain transmission, suggesting that dihydroergotamine may act at these central sites in migraine.\r"

A total of 290 recordings of epochs each lasting one minute were analysed, and pronounced regular, cyclical variations were seen in the velocity traces of these infants. The cycles occurred 1.5-5 times/minute and were present for at least one epoch in all 20 of the sick infants and in 15 of the 16 healthy mature neonates. Simultaneous recordings of the systemic blood pressure in the sick infants rarely showed the same cyclical variations. The cyclical variation is different from the beat to beat variability seen in the waveforms previously described, and is an additional factor to account for the wide variation in 'normal' velocity recordings obtained when Doppler ultrasound is measured over a short period of time.\r"

Patients detected by screening and those diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone were assessed annually for differences in clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical variables. Fifty eight infants not considered to be at risk of cystic fibrosis (they did not present with meconium ileus and do not have a sibling with cystic fibrosis) have been detected by screening and they have been compared with 44 children who were diagnosed clinically. This latter group includes nine children whose screening was negative but who were recognised subsequently to have cystic fibrosis. The mean age at diagnosis of the screened group was significantly lower than that of the group diagnosed clinically. Excluding admissions for diagnostic tests for cystic fibrosis, the screened group spent a significantly shorter time in hospital during the first year of life. The results of all other comparisons made between the screened group and those diagnosed clinically were similar up to the age of 4 years.\r"

Primary closure of the defect was successfully achieved in seven (78%) patients in the prenatally transferred group compared with 17 (55%) in the postnatal group. Significantly less postoperative assisted ventilation, and a trend in favour of early discharge home, were noted after prenatal transfer. Problems arising during postnatal transfer may have contributed to these differences. No major differences resulting from the mode of delivery were identified. Patients treated by primary closure fared significantly better than those undergoing staged repairs with prosthetic material. Prospective randomised studies are required to confirm these findings.\r"

The system was not limited either by pressure or by volume and chest movement was used as the criterion for adequate inflation. Inflation pressure and flow were recorded during resuscitation, and flow was integrated to obtain volume. Median mean pressure over the first 10 inflations was 40 cm H2O and this dropped during later resuscitation to 29 cm H2O. The volume delivered did not change significantly, so volume divided by pressure increased from a median of 0.18 to 0.35 ml/kg/cm H2O. Fourteen infants formed part of their functional residual capacity with artificial ventilation and five with spontaneous breaths. Eleven infants showed no evidence of functional residual capacity formation. In the 22 preterm infants there was a strong association between absence of functional residual capacity formation and later hyaline membrane disease that required ventilation. We suggest that pressures of more than than 30 cm H2O may be helpful during initial resuscitation and that there should be further study of devices using positive end expiratory pressure for resuscitation of preterm infants.\r"

Thirty six had pneumothorax associated with systemic hypotension and 31 had pneumothorax with normal blood pressure. The groups were similar in gestational age and severity of their respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty two of 36 of infants with pneumothorax associated with hypotension (89%) had grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage. This percentage was significantly greater than the percentage for infants with pneumothorax and normal blood pressure (three of 31, 10%). The risk ratio for grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage for infants with pneumothorax associated with hypotension was 9.8 compared with neonates with pneumothorax and normal blood pressure. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion are important factors leading to intraventricular haemorrhage in VLBW infants.\r"

A lower incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was associated with growth retardation and membrane rupture greater than 24 hours. Maternal hypertension was associated with an increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. We used the multiple logistic regression model to control for confounding variables, as the maternal and neonatal factors associated with respiratory distress syndrome were not evenly distributed between the two groups. After adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, growth retardation, and membrane rupture greater than 24 hours, the risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome was significantly greater in babies of hypertensive mothers. Significance was lost when labour before delivery and mode of delivery were taken into account. The increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in babies of hypertensive mothers may be due to the absence of labour before delivery because of the greater likelihood of caesarean section.\r"

The groups were of similar birth weight and gestational and postnatal age, though those treated with a low dose were by chance receiving a higher percentage of oxygen at the start of treatment and there were more deaths from bronchopulmonary dysplasia in this group. Of 59 infants treated with the prolonged course 53 (90%) responded initially to indomethacin compared with 48 of 62 (77%) treated conventionally--a difference of 13% (95% confidence interval for the difference 0 to 26%). Of the 53 responders 11 (21%) relapsed after low dose indomethacin, whereas after the shorter course 19 of 48 (40%) relapsed. This difference was significant (95% confidence intervals 3 to 37%). Side effects, mainly gastrointestinal haemorrhage, were similar in both groups. Significantly fewer infants experienced a rise in serum creatinine or urea concentration after treatment with low dose indomethacin. A prolonged low dose course of indomethacin offers advantages over conventional treatment.\r"

Pulmonary artery pressure was assessed non-invasively by its inverse relationship with the ratio of pulmonary artery Doppler time to peak velocity: right ventricular ejection time. The mean ratio was significantly lower in the infants with hyaline membrane disease. The mean ratio for each infant with hyaline membrane disease varied widely and did not correlate with criteria of maturity or severity of disease. Individual ratios correlated with arterial pH. Between 60-80 hours after birth, 14 of 18 infants with hyaline membrane disease (78%) and one of 19 without (5%) had patent ductus arteriosus. Left to right and bidirectional shunting at ductal and atrial level were common; pure right to left shunting was uncommon. The mean ratio seen with bidirectional shunting was significantly lower than that seen with left to right shunting. Ratios and patterns of extra pulmonary shunting were similar when the fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) was greater than 0.9 compared with when it was less than 0.9. Pulmonary artery pressure is high during the acute phase of hyaline membrane disease but varies widely among infants. A few infants have extrapulmonary right to left shunting, and these infants are difficult to detect clinically.\r"

Persons with PTSD were at increased risk for other psychiatric disorders; PTSD had stronger associations with anxiety and affective disorders than with substance abuse or dependence. Risk factors for exposure to traumatic events included low education, male sex, early conduct problems, extraversion, and family history of psychiatric disorder or substance problems. Risk factors for PTSD following exposure included early separation from parents, neuroticism, preexisting anxiety or depression, and family history of anxiety. Life-style differences associated with differential exposure to situations that have a high risk for traumatic events and personal predispositions to the PTSD effects of traumatic events might be responsible for a substantial part of PTSD in this population.\r"

Incidence of depression after the study started was also higher among those who were initially in the low socioeconomic status group, supporting the view that the stress of poverty may be causally related to depression. There was also a trend for prior depression to be associated with subsequent downward social mobility, supporting the view that the concentration of depressed people at the lower end of the social hierarchy may result from handicapping aspects of the illness. Neither of these trends was statistically significant. More striking was evidence that, irrespective of socioeconomic status, depression carried a substantial risk for poor clinical course and outcome. Both depression and poverty tended to be chronic, and, accordingly, their association at the end of the study was influenced by their association at its beginning. The stability of the relationship between poverty and depression warrants the attention of caregivers and policymakers and raises new questions about strategies for the study of causal sequences.\r"

We examined this hypothesis by assessing gender differences in DSM-III-R diagnostic status, demographic and clinical characteristics, functional limitations, self-reported health status, and psychiatric comorbidity in 30 men and 117 women who were referred for multiple unexplained somatic complaints. Twelve men and 68 women met DSM-III-R criteria for somatization disorder. Among those meeting criteria, there were few differences on any of the dimensions that were assessed. Different referral sources for women and men suggested differences in physicians' perceptions of somatic symptoms in men and women. We concluded that somatization disorder exists in men, and that women and men with somatization disorder show similar clinical characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a longitudinal study of chronic schizophrenic patients who were hospitalized for research purposes at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Program in the 1970s and early 1980s. We assessed present course, outcome and predictor data from the initial cohort of 58 young chronic schizophrenic patients who were followed up for 2 to 12 years following their NIMH index hospitalization. At follow-up, the sample showed substantial functional impairment and levels of symptoms with only about 20% of the sample demonstrating a good outcome. In addition, strong intercorrelation was noted among the symptom and functioning indexes at follow-up. Moreover, neuropsychologic tests of frontal cortical functioning were significantly correlated with outcome levels of negative symptoms and social functioning but not with levels of positive symptoms. During the period from the index hospitalization to the follow-up assessment, 78% of the sample suffered a relapse, 38% attempted suicide and 24% had episodes of major affective illness. Furthermore, levels of positive and negative symptoms ascertained when patients received optimal neuroleptic treatment during the index hospitalization significantly predicted outcome levels of symptoms and functioning and time spent hospitalized during the follow-up period. In contrast, levels of index positive and negative symptoms ascertained during the drug-free state did not predict outcome symptoms or functioning. These data suggest that treatment response is a critical predictor variable. We examined the implication of these data for the course of illness in schizophrenics.\r"

More than 50% of the sample had poor overall outcome, with either severe impairment in functioning and symptoms, or suicide, in the follow-up period. Rehospitalization rates decreased significantly during the course of the two posthospital assessments, despite the sample showing persisting psychosis. Only a small group of schizophrenic patients showed complete remission: 10% at the first follow-up and 17% at the second follow-up, when patients who suicided are excluded from consideration. While progressive deterioration is not common in schizophrenia, our relatively negative findings challenge the conclusions of some other longitudinal studies. Implications of our data on schizophrenic course are discussed.\r"

Using current inpatient and outpatient records and information from key informants active in the community, this study sought to identify all cases of schizophrenia in 36 District Electoral Divisions, constituting a clinical catchment area of 25,178 persons in a rural Irish county. Though the overall prevalence rate (3.3 per 1000) was unremarkable, this obscured a substantial and significant variation in prevalence rates (from 0.0 to 14.3 per 1000) between District Electoral Divisions. Prevalence rates in five District Electoral Divisions made particular contributions to the overall deviation from a statistical model for random occurrences in space. The results indicate spatial inhomogeneity in the prevalence of schizophrenia in rural Ireland and imply geographical variation in environmental or genetic factor(s) of etiologic relevance.\r"

Members of each group were evaluated for movement disorders by a rater who used standard rating scales and was \"blind\" to all diagnoses and treatments. Neuroleptic-treated diabetics had a significantly higher prevalence and severity of tardive dyskinesia. There were no differences between groups on other possible risk factors for tardive dyskinesia, including parkinsonism, anticholinergic drug treatment, or cognitive function.

Arecoline induced REM sleep in a dose-dependent fashion in both patients and controls compared with placebo infusions. Compared with normal controls, patients entered REM sleep significantly more rapidly following intravenous administration of 1.0 mg of arecoline hydrobromide than they did following administration of 0.5 mg of arecoline hydrobromide or placebo. These results, as well as those of previous studies, support the hypothesis that patients with affective disorder show a functional supersensitive induction of REM sleep in response to muscarinic receptor agonists and may be consistent with the hypothesis that functional muscarinic receptor \"up regulation\" is associated with depression.\r"

Two distinct groups were identified: (1) The endogenous group (n = 9) included patients with methemoglobinemia associated with an intercurrent illness. (2) The exogenous group (n = 8) included patients with methemoglobinemia secondary to drug exposure. Despite similar initial methemoglobin levels in the endogenous (mean, 29%) and exogenous (mean, 28%) groups, children in the endogenous group had more acidosis (serum bicarbonate levels of 5.9 vs 19.1 mmol/L and arterial pH of 7.01 vs 7.35). All the children in the exogenous group with methemoglobinemia secondary to an accidental ingestion stayed only 1 day in the hospital, while children in the endogenous group were admitted for an average of 19 days. Children with methemoglobinemia secondary to a drug exposure have a more benign illness with a shorter duration than children with methemoglobinemia associated with an intercurrent illness. It appears that the absolute level of methemoglobin is not as important as the underlying cause in determining both the course and severity of illness.\r"
