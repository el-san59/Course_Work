  ".W": "The effect of ultrasound on the degradation of polymers and the release rate of incorporated molecules within those polymers was examined. Up to 5-fold reversible increases in degradation rate and up to 20-fold reversible increases in release rate of incorporated molecules were observed with biodegradable polyanhydrides, polyglycolides, and polylactides. Up to 10-fold reversible increases in release rate of incorporated molecules within nonerodible ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer were also observed. The release rate increased in proportion to the intensity of ultrasound. Temperature and mixing were relatively unimportant in effecting enhanced polymer degradation, whereas cavitation appeared to play a significant role. Increased release rates were also observed when ultrasound was applied to biodegradable polymers implanted in rats. Histological examination revealed no differences between normal rat skin and rat skin that had been exposed to ultrasonic radiation for 1 hr. With further study, ultrasound may prove useful as a way of externally regulating release rates from polymers in a variety of situations where on-demand release is required.\r"

  ".W": "The cleavage of DNA by esperamicin is greatly accelerated in the presence of thiol compounds. Oxygen and active oxygen-radical scavengers have no significant influence upon DNA strand breakage by esperamicin. The preferential cutting sites of esperamicin are at thymidylate residues, and the frequency of bases attacked (T greater than C greater than A greater than G) is different from that of calicheamicin (C much greater than T greater than A = G), neocarzinostatin (T greater than A greater than C greater than G), or bleomycin (C greater than T greater than A greater than G). Esperamicin preferentially attacks at T and C bases in oligopyrimidine sequences such as 5'-CTC-3', 5'-TTC-3', and 5'-TTT-3'. In contrast to the preferred sites of cleavage by bleomycin, 5'-GT-3' and 5'-GC-3', the preferred sites of esperamicin-mediated DNA degradation are 5'-TG-3' and 5'-CG-3' sequences. The nucleotide-specific cleavage mode of esperamicin is significantly affected by pretreatment of DNA with netropsin and distamycin A, suggesting that interaction of esperamicin occurs through the minor groove of B-DNA. This is further supported by the asymmetric cleavage pattern to the 3' side on the opposite strand of the DNA. The roles of the fucose-anthranilate moiety and the trisaccharide side chain of esperamicin in DNA binding and base recognition are discussed.\r"

The predicted protein encoded by this gene is homologous to the human erythrocyte glucose transporter and to several sugar-transport proteins from Escherichia coli. These structural similarities strongly suggest that the cloned gene encodes a membrane transport protein that is developmentally induced when the parasite enters its insect vector. Regulated membrane transporters may be required for the parasite to adapt to the environment of the insect gut.\r"

  ".U": "90046662\r", 
  ".W": "Aromatic amines are well known as occupational carcinogens and are found in cooked foods, tobacco smoke, synthetic fuels, and agricultural chemicals. For the primary arylamines, metabolic N-oxidation by hepatic cytochromes P-450 is generally regarded as an initial activation step leading to carcinogenesis. The metabolic activation of 4-aminobiphenyl, 2-naphthylamine, and several heterocyclic amines has been shown recently to be catalyzed by rat cytochrome P-450ISF-G and by its human ortholog, cytochrome P-450PA. We now report that human hepatic microsomal caffeine 3-demethylation, the initial major step in caffeine biotransformation in humans, is selectively catalyzed by cytochrome P-450PA. Caffeine 3-demethylation was highly correlated with 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation (r = 0.99; P less than 0.0005) in hepatic microsomal preparations obtained from 22 human organ donors, and both activities were similarly decreased by the selective inhibitor, 7,8-benzoflavone. The rates of microsomal caffeine 3-demethylation, 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation, and phenacetin O-deethylation were also significantly correlated with each other and with the levels of immunoreactive human cytochrome P-450PA. Moreover, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to human cytochrome P-450PA was shown to inhibit strongly all three of these activities and to inhibit the N-oxidation of the carcinogen 2-naphthylamine and the heterocyclic amines, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline. Human liver cytochrome P-450PA was also shown to catalyze caffeine 3-demethylation, 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation, and phenacetin O-deethylation. Thus, estimation of caffeine 3-demethylation activity in humans may be useful in the characterization of arylamine N-oxidation phenotypes and in the assessment of whether or not the hepatic levels of cytochrome P-450PA, as affected by environmental or genetic factors, contribute to interindividual differences in susceptibility to arylamine-induced cancers.\r"

The protein spots were collected from multiple gels, rehydrated, concentrated by stacking into a new gel, electroblotted onto inert membranes, and in situ-digested with trypsin. Peptides eluting from the membranes were separated by HPLC and sequenced. Using this procedure, it was possible to generate partial sequences from 13 human proteins recorded in the amnion cell protein data base. Eight of these sequences matched those of proteins stored in data bases, demonstrating that a systematic analysis of proteins by computerized two-dimensional gel electrophoresis can be directly linked to protein microsequencing methods. The latter technique offers a unique opportunity to link information contained in protein data bases derived from the analysis of two-dimensional gels with forthcoming DNA sequence data on the human genome.\r"

The algorithm does not include tertiary interactions or pseudoknots and employs a crude model for single-stranded regions. The only favorable interactions are base pairing and stacking of terminal unpaired nucleotides at the ends of helixes.

The chicken intestinal epithelial cell MHC shows overall similarity in primary structure to other MHCs in the areas of the reactive thiol residues and in areas contributing to the ATP binding site and actin binding site. The globular head domain is followed by an alpha-helical coiled-coil region, and as in smooth muscle MHC there is a short uncoiled sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. Comparison of amino acid sequences in the rod regions between human and chicken cellular MHCs shows a remarkable 92% identity.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) is a zinc-containing dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase widely distributed in mammalian tissues and is thought to play a critical role in blood pressure regulation. Testis contains a unique, androgen-dependent ACE isozyme of unknown function. We have determined the cDNA sequence for human testicular ACE; it encodes a protein that is identical, from residue 37 to its C terminus, to the second half or C-terminal domain of the endothelial ACE sequence [Soubrier, F., Alhenc-Gelas, F., Hubert, C., Allegrini, J., John, M., Tregear, G. & Corvol, P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 9386-9390]. The full-length human testis ACE cDNA was constructed from a composite of cloned cDNAs, obtained by a combination of (i) immunoscreening and hybridization screening of a human testicular cDNA library in lambda gt11 and (ii) hybridization screening of human testis cDNAs constructed with ACE-specific primers and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The protein sequence inferred consists of a 732-residue preprotein including a 31-residue signal peptide. The mature polypeptide has a molecular weight of 80,073. The testis enzyme contains the second of the two putative metal-binding sites (His-Glu-Met-Gly-His) identified in endothelial ACE. This indicates that the functionally active catalytic site is within the C-terminal domain of the endothelial enzyme, accounting for the previous finding that these two structurally dissimilar isozymes are virtually identical catalytically. Of 22 testis ACE cDNAs cloned and sequenced, 3 have unique 5' regions, consisting of inserted, deleted, or substituted sequences up to 328 base pairs long, which have apparently arisen by alternative pre-mRNA splicing.\r"

Simulations are carried out for a series of solutions containing double-helical DNA oligomers of varying numbers of phosphate charges N (8 less than or equal to N less than or equal to 100) and univalent electrolyte at fixed activity (a +/- = 1.76 mmol/dm3). These results are used to evaluate as follows: C+N(a), the local concentration of cations at various axial positions along the oligomer surface; C+N(a), the axial average of these concentrations; TN, the preferential interaction coefficient expressed per oligomer charge, which is directly related to the fractional thermodynamic extent of association of counterions. A sufficiently long oligomer (N greater than or equal to 48 under the conditions simulated) is characterized by an interior region over which C+N(a) is uniform and equal to C+ infinity (a), the polyion limit. This interior region is flanked by two symmetric terminal regions, in which C+N(a) varies linearly with axial position from the end of the oligomer to a distance approximately 18 monomer units (approximately 3.1 nm) from that end. For long oligomers, the characteristics of the terminal regions [length and axial profile of C+N(a)] do not vary with N and, by inference, also pertain to the polyion under the same conditions. Both C+N(a) and TN approach their polyelectrolyte limits as linear functions of 1/N. These linear dependences can be attributed to the increasing predominance of the contribution due to the polyion-like interior of the oligomer as N increases.\r"

P450scc mRNA increased by 2 hr and was maximal by 8 hr; polymerase run-on experiments showed this was due to increased P450scc gene transcription. MA-10 cells are a hormonally homogeneous population, as all cells expressed P450scc mRNA and responded to cAMP equally. cAMP-stimulated accumulation of P450scc mRNA continued in the presence of cycloheximide. Gonadotropins stimulated testicular steroidogenesis by coordinate cAMP-induced increases in P450scc gene transcription, mRNA accumulation, and P450scc activity. We cloned rat P450c17 cDNA and showed it detected no P450c17 mRNA in control or cAMP-stimulated MA-10 cells by RNA transfer blots or RNase protection assays. Similarly, HPLC detected no 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone or testosterone synthesis in MA-10 cells. Thus MA-10 cells, unlike untransformed Leydig cells, do not express detectable amounts of P450c17 mRNA or P450c17 activity.\r"

To assess the role of this enhancer in the activation of MLC expression during development, transgenic mice were generated carrying multiple copies of a MLC1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) transcription unit linked to a genomic fragment including the enhancer. CAT expression was detected in four mouse lines, up to 1000-fold higher in skeletal muscles than in other tissues. Activation of endogenous MLC1 transcription in these animals 4 days before birth was reflected in the onset of CAT transgene expression. This study identifies the transcriptional control elements necessary to activate the 21-kilobase MLC1/3 locus at the appropriate fetal stage and indicates that the MLC enhancer is sufficient to induce developmentally regulated expression from the MLC1 promoter exclusively in skeletal muscle cells.\r"

By using this technique, we show that several regions of the 3' splice site of mRNA precursors are protected during the formation of splicing-specific ribonucleoprotein complexes in an in vitro splicing system. These regions include the 3' intron/exon junction and a portion of the adjacent exon, the polypyrimidine tract, and the site of branch formation. These protections appear to be due to splicing specific complexes since their formation is sensitive to point mutations at crucial residues and requires ATP and incubation. The formation of these protected regions is independent of the presence of a 5' splice site.\r"

  ".W": "Two forms of erythropoietin, EPO-bi and EPO-tetra, with different biological activities were isolated from the culture medium of a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, B8-300, into which the human erythropoietin gene had been introduced. EPO-bi, an unusual form, showed only one-seventh the in vivo activity and 3 times higher in vitro activity of the previously described recombinant human EPO (standard EPO). In contrast, EPO-tetra showed both in vivo and in vitro activities comparable to those of the standard EPO. EPO-bi, EPO-tetra, and the standard EPO had the same amino acid composition and immunoreactivity. However, structural analyses of their N-linked sugar chains revealed that EPO-bi contains the biantennary complex type as the major sugar chain, while EPO-tetra and the standard EPO contain the tetraantennary complex type as the major sugar chain. From examination of various preparations of recombinant human EPO, we found a positive correlation between the in vivo activity of EPO and the ratio of tetraantennary to biantennary oligosaccharides. These results suggest that higher branching of the N-linked sugar chains is essential for effective expression of in vivo biological activity of EPO.\r"

The cells transfected with this construct showed foci of densely growing, morphologically altered cells, when grown either in low-serum (0.05%) or in serum-free medium. The c-ets-2-derived foci contained additional copies of the c-ets-2 gene, Northern blot analysis demonstrated overexpression of a c-ets-2-specific 2.5-kilobase RNA, and ets-specific antiserum recognized a 56-kDa protein. Overexpression of the c-ets-2-encoded protein stimulated cell proliferation and abolished their serum requirement. The c-ets-2 transfected cells formed colonies in semisolid medium and induced tumors in nude mice, indicating that c-ets-2 can be a transforming gene when overexpressed in these cells. This work demonstrates that a member of the c-ets gene family has transforming and mitogenic activity. In addition, the role of c-ets-2 in cell proliferation and its location in the minimal Down syndrome region on chromosome 21 implicates its involvement in the phenotypic changes associated with Down syndrome.\r"

Unlike the two previous preparations of insulin receptor kinase in this expression system, this molecule contains the complete unmodified sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor beta subunit. Our construct allows high-level expression of the recombinant protein in cultured Sf9 cells and in cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) larvae. An improved purification procedure yields greater than or equal to 95% pure protein in 55% yield from the cells. The specific activity of this purified protein is 3.5-fold greater than from the previously described baculovirus insulin receptor kinase (that included residues 946-1343 from the proreceptor). Like the latter molecule, the insulin receptor kinase molecule reported here sediments as a monomer, and its autophosphorylation occurs by an intramolecular process. Preliminary data about the spectroscopic features of the cytosolic domain of the human insulin receptor are presented.\r"

A thiol-reducing agent and Mg2+ are required for catalysis of the arsenolysis reaction by protein C.

  ".U": "90046696\r", 
  ".W": "A cDNA clone encoding a human cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein (p58) has been isolated. The human sequence was found to be homologous to that of rat pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) subtype M2. p58 is a monomer that has approximately 5% the enzymatic activity of the tetrameric pyruvate kinase M2. The tetrameric M2 does not bind 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Binding of p58 to T3 and its analogs resulted in the inhibition of its pyruvate kinase activity. The apparent Ki values of T3, L-thyroxine, and D-T3 are 30 nM, 100 nM, and 2 mM, respectively. L-Thyronine and 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine had no effect. This order of activity correlates with the thermogenic effects reported for T3 and its analogs. Conversion of p58 to the tetramer is reversible and is under the control of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The conversion is inhibited by T3 in a dose-dependent manner. Since pyruvate kinase is a key enzyme in regulating cellular ADP, ATP, and pyruvate, our findings suggest that p58 may be involved in mediating some of the cellular metabolic effects induced by thyroid hormones.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a modified attractor neural network in which neuronal dynamics takes place on a time scale of the absolute refractory period but the mean temporal firing rate of any neuron in the network is lower by an arbitrary factor that characterizes the strength of the effective inhibition. It operates by encoding information on the excitatory neurons only and assuming the inhibitory neurons to be faster and to inhibit the excitatory ones by an effective postsynaptic potential that is expressed in terms of the activity of the excitatory neurons themselves. Retrieval is identified as a nonergodic behavior of the network whose consecutive states have a significantly enhanced activity rate for the neurons that should be active in a stored pattern and a reduced activity rate for the neurons that are inactive in the memorized pattern. In contrast to the Hopfield model the network operates away from fixed points and under the strong influence of noise. As a consequence, of the neurons that should be active in a pattern, only a small fraction is active in any given time cycle and those are randomly distributed, leading to reduced temporal rates. We argue that this model brings neural network models much closer to biological reality. We present the results of detailed analysis of the model as well as simulations.\r"

In the BR-568 to M-state transition, which is known to be a key step in transmembrane proton pumping, reversible structural changes of the protein were detected. These structural alterations occur in the neighborhood of the cyclohexene ring and at the Schiff's base end of the chromophore retinal. They are interpreted as a 1-2 degree tilt of three or four of the transmembrane alpha-helices or as positional changes of four or five amino acids. The structural changes observed are inherent in the transport mechanism of bacteriorhodopsin.\r"

  ".U": "90046700\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium plays a crucial role in many cellular processes. Its functions are directly dependent on the high specificity for Ca2+ exhibited by the proteins and ion carriers that bind divalent ions. To elucidate the basis for this specificity we have calculated the relative energies of solvation of calcium and magnesium ions in complexes with cyclo(-L-Pro-Gly-)3, a small synthetic peptide that binds Ca2+ with an affinity comparable to those of the naturally occurring proteins. The results show that the ion selectivity of the peptide resides in the difference in the solvation energies of the competing ions in water. Although the peptide is able to complex Mg2+ better than Ca2+ in the stoichiometries in which cyclo(-L-Pro-Gly-)3 binds divalent ions, it is not always able to provide as much stabilization for Mg2+ as water does. These results also explain why cyclo(-L-Pro-Gly-)3 binds Ca2+ and Mg2+ with different stoichiometries and indicate the source for expected differences in the structures of complexes of the two ions.\r"

A cellular factor from pea and tobacco leaf tissue, which recognizes nucleotides in a tandemly repeated TGACG motif at the -75 region of this promoter, has been detected by DNase I footprinting and gel retardation assays. This factor is named activation sequence factor 1 (ASF-1). A cellular factor binding to the two TGACG motifs can also be detected in tobacco root extracts. Mutations at these motifs inhibit binding of ASF-1 to the 35S promoter in vitro. When examined in transgenic tobacco, these mutations cause a 50% drop in leaf expression of the 35S promoter. In addition, these same mutations attenuate stem and root expression of the 35S promoter about 5- to 10-fold when compared to the level of expression in leaf. In contrast, mutations at two adjacent CCAAT-box-like sequences have no dramatic effect on promoter activity in vivo. A 21-base-pair element containing the two TGACG motifs is sufficient for binding of ASF-1 in vitro when inserted in a green-tissue-specific promoter. In vivo, the insertion of an ASF-1 binding site caused high levels of expression in root. Thus, a single factor binding site that is defined by site-specific mutations is shown to be sufficient to alter the expression pattern of promoters in vivo.\r"

Cultures of Swiss 3T3, Swiss 3T6, A431, DDT1-MF2, and HFF cells were used. The percent of cell nuclei labeled with [3H]thymidine and cell number were also increased. ADP was equally mitogenic, while UTP and ITP were much less active. The effect of ATP was not due to hydrolysis by ectoenzymes to form adenosine, a known growth factor. Thus, the nonhydrolyzable analogue adenosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate was mitogenic. In addition, it was found that ATP showed synergism in 3T6 and 3T3 cells when present for only the first hour of an incorporation assay, during which time no significant hydrolysis occurred. Furthermore, prolonged preincubation of cells with ATP reduced the mitogenic response to ATP but not to adenosine; preincubation with adenosine or N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine had the reverse effect. Finally, the effect of adenosine, but not of ATP, was inhibited by aminophylline. We conclude that extracellular ATP is a mitogen that interacts with P2 purinoceptors on the plasma membrane.\r"

We have examined the template activities of nuclear DNAs using the HeLa cell in vitro transcription system. All of the three photosynthesis genes from the green cell line and act from both cell types were well transcribed in vitro, but these photosynthesis genes from the white cell line were not, indicating that the transcriptional regulation is ascribable to DNA templates. Digestion of nuclear DNA with methyl-sensitive and -insensitive isoschizomeric endonucleases and the subsequent Southern hybridization showed that each gene has the identical recognition sites of restriction enzymes in the green and white cell lines, but some of the sites were methylated only in the photosynthesis genes in the white cells. There was observed a clear inverse relationship between the level of expressed transcripts and the extent of DNA methylation. Thus, it is inferred that the selective methylation of DNA is a likely mechanism for suppressing transcription of nuclear genes for photosynthesis in the nonphotosynthetic plant cells.\r"

Although it has been possible to introduce genes into mammalian cells and to control their expression, it has proven difficult to introduce mammalian cells as carriers of the modified genetic information into hosts. The successful implantation of selective cells cannot be achieved without adequate vascular support, an essential step toward integration and reconstitution of a new biological function. Although a partial solution to this problem has been found by inducing specific site-directed neovessel formation using heparin-binding growth factor 1 (HBGF-1) adsorbed to a collagen matrix, these implants function for only a short period (weeks). We now report the formation of organoid neovascular structures using polytetrafluoroethylene fibers coated with collagen and HBGF-1 implanted in the peritoneal cavity of the rat. The organoid structures contained readily visible vascular lumina and nonvascular structures that resemble nerve tissue. It was also possible to demonstrate that the vascular system on the implant is continuous with the vascular tree of the host. This feature was used to demonstrate that the organoid structures are capable of sustaining the biological function of implanted normal rat hepatocytes over long periods of time (months) in the homozygous Gunn rat, thereby facilitating future applications involving the delivery of new genetic information.\r"

Using data gathered during a 10-yr study of breeding success, we found that males with familiar neighbors fledged, on average, significantly more offspring annually than males without familiar neighbors. We also found that the same males, breeding in different years on the same territories, had significantly larger harems in the years they had familiar neighbors. Improved reproductive success was due to the males' abilities to attract more females to nest in their territories. Alternative hypotheses to explain the positive relationship between familiar neighbors and breeding success were not supported by our data. Relatively high reproductive success for breeders with long-term neighbors may provide a basis for the evolution of cooperative behavior in this and other species.\r"

The disease was first described in humans but was recently reported in dairy cattle in Australia. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the normal bovine cDNA for argininosuccinate synthetase and the mutation present in animals with citrullinemia. Analysis of DNA from affected animals by Southern blotting did not readily identify the mutation in the bovine gene. RNA (Northern) blotting revealed a major reduction in the steady-state amount of mRNA in the liver of affected animals to less than 5% of controls. The bovine cDNA was cloned and sequenced and revealed 96% identity with the deduced human sequence at the amino acid level. Starting with mutant bovine liver, the mRNA was reverse-transcribed; the cDNA product was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence revealed a C----T transition converting arginine-86 (CGA) to a nonsense codon (TGA). A second C----T transition represented a polymorphism in proline-175 (CCC----CCT). The mutation and the polymorphism were confirmed by amplification of genomic DNA and demonstration with restriction endonuclease enzymes of both the loss of an Ava II site in DNA from mutant animals at codon 86 and the presence or absence of a Dde I site at codon 175. The loss of the Ava II site can be used for rapid, economical, nonradioactive detection of heterozygotes for bovine citrullinemia.\r"

  ".W": "Both the polycythemia-inducing and the anemia-inducing strains of Friend spleen focus-forming virus can induce acute erythroleukemia in susceptible adult mice. However, only cells infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain become erythropoietin-independent for proliferation and differentiation. The sequences responsible for the altered erythropoietin responsiveness have previously been localized to a 678-base-pair EcoRI-Cla I fragment at the 3' end of the envelope gene. This region is now further analyzed by dividing it into two fragments by using the Fok I restriction site. Two recombinants were made by replacing either the 558-base-pair EcoRI-Fok I or the 113-base-pair Fok I-Cla I env gene fragments from the anemia-inducing strain of spleen focus-forming virus with sequences derived from the polycythemia-inducing strain. Our results indicate that the 113-base-pair Fok I-Cla I fragment, which encodes primarily the transmembrane domain of the envelope protein, determines erythropoietin-independent growth.\r"

This library was used to complement Dictyostelium strain HPS400, which lacks thymidylate synthase activity and requires exogenous thymidine for growth. We have used a modified high-frequency transformation protocol that allows the introduction of the library into a sufficient number of Dictyostelium cells to select complementing plasmids. Using this approach, we have isolated a gene (Thy1) that complements the thymidine growth requirement of HPS400. The gene encodes a 1.2-kilobase RNA and the derived amino acid sequence shows no homology to thymidylate synthase, a protein highly conserved throughout evolution, or any other protein sequence in the data base examined. Thy1 provides an important selectable marker for transforming Dictyostelium cells. In addition, this work suggests that it will be possible to isolate genes that are essential for developmental processes in Dictyostelium by complementation.\r"

  ".W": "Nearly half the adult human population does not perceive an odor when sniffing androstenone (5 alpha-androst-16-en-3-one), a volatile steroid found in human perspiration, boar saliva, some pork products (e.g., bacon), truffles, and celery. This variation in ability to perceive androstenone has a significant heritable component, suggesting that androstenone insensitivity is in part determined genetically. We now report that the ability to perceive androstenone was induced in 10 of 20 initially insensitive subjects who were systematically exposed to androstenone. Since olfactory neurons of the olfactory epithelium undergo periodic replacement from differentiating basal cells, and assuming the induction of sensitivity to be peripheral, we propose that a portion of the apparently anosmic human population does in fact possess olfactory neurons with specific receptors for androstenone. Such neurons may undergo clonal expansion, or selection of lineages with more receptors or receptors of higher affinity, in response to androstenone stimulation, much in the manner of lymphocytes responding to antigenic stimulation, thus raising odor stimulation to the level of conscious perception. As a guide to further study of the genetics and mechanism of variation of androstenone perception, we provisionally envisage three categories of human subjects, the truly anosmic, the inducible, and those subjects who either are constitutionally sensitive or have already experienced incidental induction.\r"

The potential for standard base pairing between acceptor stem positions 1 and 72 is disrupted in the mutant sufS627. This disruption may interfere with the interaction of the tRNA with elongation factor-Tu.GTP or an as-yet-unspecified domain of the ribosome. The potential for standard base pairing in part of the TFC stem is disrupted in mutant sufS625. The nearly universal C-61 base of the TFC stem is altered in mutant sufS617, and the TFC loop is extended in mutant sufS605. These changes are expected to interfere with the stability of the TFC loop and its interaction with the D arm. The mutation in mutant sufS605, and possibly other mutants, alters nucleoside modification in the D arm. Three mutants, sufS601, sufS607, and sufS609, have a cytidine substituted for the modified uridine at position 34, the first anticodon position. None of the alterations grossly disrupts in-frame triplet decoding by the mutant tRNAs. The results show that -1 frameshifting in vivo can be caused by tRNAs with normal anticodon loop size and suggest that alternative conformational states of the mutant tRNAs may allow them to read a codon in frame or to shift reading frame.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the genetic regulation of TL expression, 12 transgenic mouse strains on a C3H (TL-nonexpressing) background have been derived: two Tg.Tlaa-3 strains with Tlaa-3 isolated from A-strain TL+ thymocytes, four Tg.T3b strains with T3b from a TL+ leukemia arising in a C57BL/6 (TL-) mouse, three Tg.Con.3 strains with an H-2Kb/T3b chimeric gene (construct 3,5'flanking region and exon 1 of H-2Kb and exons 2-6 of T3b), one Tg.Con.4 strain with a T3b/H-2Kb chimeric gene (construct 4, 5' flanking region and exon 1 of T3b and exons 2-8 of H-2Kb), and two Tg.H-2Kb strains with H-2Kb. Expression of the transgenes was determined by the presence of TL or H-2Kb products or transcripts. Both Tg.Tlaa-3 strains expressed high levels of TL antigen in thymus, indicating that (i) the 9.6-kilobase Tlaa-3 DNA fragment contains sufficient information for correct tissue-specific expression in thymocytes and (ii) TL- thymocytes of C3H provide conditions for the transcriptional activation of Tlaa-3. In contrast, neither the four Tg.T3b strains nor the Tg.Con.4 strain expressed transgenes, indicating that (i) T3b lacks elements necessary for TL expression in normal thymocytes and (ii) the corresponding endogenous TL genes of C3H mice also lack these elements. The pattern of TL expression in two of the three Tg.Con.3 strains was similar to that of H-2Kb expression, indicating that transcription of this H-2Kb/T3b chimeric gene was driven by the regulatory sequences of H-2Kb. The thymuses of mice derived from the Tg.Tlaa-3-1 strain were smaller than C3H thymuses, and the surface phenotype of Tg.Tlaa-3-1 thymocytes resembled thymocyte precursors (TL+L3T4-Lyt-2-Thy-1+H-2+). These mice developed a high incidence of lymphomas with the same thymocyte precursor phenotype. The study of TL transgenic strains should prove useful in defining the role of TL in normal and abnormal T-cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular mechanism by which interleukin 6 (IL-6) induces terminal differentiation of B cells was investigated in a subpopulation of the clonal human B-lymphoblastoid cell line CESS selected for high density of cell surface IgG1. Induction of CESS cells with IL-6 resulted in a 15-fold preferential accumulation of secreted-specific gamma 1 (gamma 1s) mRNA but not of the alternatively processed membrane-specific gamma 1 (gamma 1m) mRNA. Similarly, microseconds mRNA but not the microns mRNA of the nonproductively rearranged mu heavy-chain allele was also increased. Accompanying the differential accumulation of gamma 1s mRNA was a 4.5-fold increase in lambda light-chain mRNA, leading to secretion of IgG1. Analyses of transcription in isolated nuclei demonstrated that transcriptional activation was the primary mechanism for quantitative increase of immunoglobulin mRNAs (5.5-fold for gamma 1 and mu and at least 2-fold for lambda). Since polymerase loading is diminished by 75% before reaching the downstream gamma 1m polyadenylylation site in CESS cells, irrespective of IL-6 induction, transcriptional pausing/termination appears intrinsic and contributes to the selection of gamma 1s and gamma 1m polyadenylylation sites in activated B cells. Furthermore, differential mRNA stabilization is likely to contribute to the alteration of the gamma 1s/gamma 1m mRNA ratio at IL-6 induction.\r"

Equilibrium binding studies have identified a class of IL-1 receptors on T cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells that have 2- to 5-fold higher affinity than the receptors on bone marrow cells, pre-B cells, and macrophage cell lines. Affinity cross-linking with human 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha (125I-IL-1 alpha) labels an approximately 100-kDa protein on T cells and fibroblasts and an approximately 80-kDa protein on pre-B cells and macrophage cell lines. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for the IL-1 receptor on T cells and fibroblasts block human 125I-IL-1 alpha binding to T cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells but cannot block IL-1 binding to bone marrow cells, pre-B cells, and macrophages. These antibodies immunoprecipitate the IL-1 receptor-human 125I-IL-1 alpha complex from T cells and fibroblasts but not from pre-B cells and macrophage cell lines. An S1 nuclease protection assay demonstrated that T cells and fibroblasts contain identical IL-1 receptor mRNA but that pre-B cells and macrophages do not contain this receptor mRNA. Taken together, the data demonstrate that mouse T cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells express an identical IL-1 receptor, whereas the IL-1 receptor on pre-B cells, macrophages, and bone marrow cells represents a different gene product.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that binding of interleukin 1 (IL-1) to its receptor and intracellular processing of the IL-1/IL-1 receptor complex appear to be different in B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines. In this study we used a B-lymphoid cell line, 70Z/3, and T-lymphoid cell line, EL-4 6.1 C10, to explore further the differences that exist between IL-1 receptors on cells of B and T lineage. We show that a monoclonal antibody against the IL-1 receptor on EL-4 cells does not bind to the IL-1 receptor on 70Z/3 cells. This finding suggests that there are structural differences in the extracellular domains of the IL-1 receptors on the two cell lines. Furthermore, affinity crosslinking showed that the molecular mass of the IL-1 receptor on EL-4 is 87 kDa, whereas that of 70Z/3 is significantly lower (66 kDa). Activation of phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) greatly reduced the number of IL-1 binding sites on 70Z/3. But, in sharp contrast, PMA had no effect on surface IL-1 receptor expression on EL-4 cells despite having an equally potent effect in activating protein kinase C. The different effects of protein kinase C suggest that the cytoplasmic domains of the IL-1 receptors in 70Z/3 and EL-4 may also be different. Lastly, a probe containing the entire coding region of the murine T-cell IL-1 receptor hybridized under high stringency conditions with mRNA from EL-4 cells but not with mRNA from 70Z/3 cells. Taken together, the observations made in this study suggest that major structural differences exist between the IL-1 receptors on B and T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebrovascular amyloid is the main constituent of the perivascular and neuritic plaques typical of Alzheimer disease, whereas neurofilaments and microtubule-associated tau protein have been considered primary contributors to the formation of the characteristic Alzheimer tangles. Plaques and tangles and their constituents have at times been ascribed a role in pathogenesis of the disease. Normally, neurofilaments become phosphorylated only upon axonal entry. In many neurologic disorders, neurofilament phosphorylation, as detected by any of the available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to neurofilament phosphorylated epitopes is shifted from an axonal to a cell-body location. An exception is provided by Alzheimer disease, where tangles (which are neuronal cell-body-derived structures) exhibit only one phosphorylated epitope. However, the very presence of neurofilaments in tangles and plaques has been questioned because of a reported cross-reaction of mAbs to phosphorylated neurofilaments with tau protein. On reinvestigating this cross-reactivity we found that four of five mAbs to phosphorylated neurofilaments and four of five mAbs to nonphosphorylated neurofilaments failed to react with tau protein. A fifth mAb (07-5) to phosphorylated neurofilament cross-reacted with partially denatured tau protein at an affinity 1/1700th of that for denatured neurofilaments; nondenatured tau protein in tissue sections did not cross-react. A fifth mAb (02-40) to nonphosphorylated neurofilament also cross-reacted weakly. In Alzheimer disease normal-appearing axons were revealed with all the mAbs to phosphorylated neurofilaments, but tangles were revealed with only one of them (mAb 07-5). mAb to tau protein did not stain or did so indistinctly. Four of five mAbs to nonphosphorylated neurofilaments failed to reveal axons. Upon dephosphorylation of tissue, staining by mAbs to phosphorylated neurofilaments disappeared, and axons were revealed with the mAb to tau protein and all mAbs to the nonphosphorylated neurofilaments. Tangles became stained with tau mAb and one mAb to the nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (mAb 10-1). Quantitative evaluation of immunocytochemical staining intensities and immunoblot cross-reactivity showed that neurofilaments are, indeed, constituents of tangles--apparently exceeding the concentration of tau protein 17-fold. Contribution of both conformation and primary structure to IgG specificity may explain the lack of any cross-reaction of mAbs to neurofilaments with tau protein in intact tissue and the appearance of cross-reaction in immunoblots where conformation specificity may be largely lost.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

An initial retrospective analysis of antibodies to synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins representing env, pol, and gag regions of HIV-1 was carried out. Sera studied were from 33 children who were born to HIV-infected mothers and whose clinical outcome was known at the time of analysis. Sera, collected within the first 6 months of life, of uninfected at-risk children were found to selectively contain maternal antibodies to certain peptides containing epitopes of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120. To confirm the predictive role of maternal antibodies to defined HIV-1 epitopes, a prospective analysis was then performed on sera from 21 HIV-seropositive mothers and their infants, whose clinical and immunological status was then followed up for a period of at least 15 months. As expected, antibodies to the same envelope protein peptides were detected almost exclusively in sera from mothers of uninfected children. Our data suggest that antibodies against select epitopes of HIV envelope protein gp120 might play an important role in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, site-directed serology might be used to predict the outcome of an at-risk pregnancy of an HIV-infected woman.\r"

Whether its platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-like product functionally activates its receptors within the cell or at the cell surface has potential implications in efforts to intervene with the v-sis-transformed phenotype. We demonstrate that intracellular as well as cell surface forms of two PDGF receptor gene products are tyrosine phosphorylated in v-sis transformants. In a chemically defined medium in which cell growth was dependent on v-sis expression, proliferation was partially inhibited by PDGF neutralizing antibody but completely blocked by suramin. Suramin treatment resulted in a marked reduction in tyrosine phosphorylated cell surface PDGF receptors but had no effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular receptor species. All of these findings demonstrate that the v-sis-encoded mitogen can bind and activate its receptors internally but that activated receptors must achieve a cell surface location in order to functionally couple with intracellular mitogenic signaling pathways.\r"

The hybrid AAV-B19 genome was rescued from a recombinant plasmid and then the DNA was replicated upon transfection into adenovirus 2-infected human KB cells in the presence of AAV genes coding for proteins required for AAV DNA replication (AAV-Rep proteins). In addition, in the presence of AAV genes coding for the viral capsid proteins (AAV-Cap proteins), the rescued/replicated hybrid AAV-B19 genomes were packed into mature AAV progeny virions, which were subsequently released into culture supernatants. The recombinant AAV-B19 progeny virions were infectious for normal human bone marrow cells and strongly suppressed erythropoiesis in vitro. The availability of an infectious recombinant B19 virus should facilitate the mutational analysis of the viral genome, which, in turn, may yield information on individual viral gene functions in B19-induced pathogenesis. The hybrid AAV-B19 genome may also prove to be a useful vector for gene transfer in human bone marrow cells.\r"

  ".W": "Laron-type dwarfism is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is characterized by high levels of growth hormone and low levels of insulin-like growth factor I in the circulation. Several lines of evidence suggest that this disease is caused by a defect in the growth hormone receptor. In order to analyze the receptor gene in patients with Laron-type dwarfism and with other growth disorders, we have first determined the gene structure in normal individuals. There are nine exons that encode the receptor and several additional exons in the 5' untranslated region. The coding exons span at least 87 kilobase pairs of chromosome 5. Characterization of the growth hormone receptor gene from nine patients with Laron-type dwarfism shows that two individuals have a deletion of a large portion of the extracellular, hormone binding domain of the receptor gene. Interestingly, this deletion includes nonconsecutive exons, suggesting that an unusual rearrangement may have occurred. Thus, we provide direct evidence that Laron-type dwarfism can result from a defect in the structural gene for the growth hormone receptor.\r"

Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence alignments of the FIV coding sequences with analogous sequences of other lentiviruses revealed significant identities only in the gag and pol genes.

  ".W": "Area 17 in the neonate of numerous species receives projections from cortical areas that do not project to area 17 in the adult. To investigate if this were the case in the developing primate, we have made injections of retrograde tracers in area 17 of newborn monkeys (Macaca irus) and examined the areal distribution of labeled neurons. Neurons projecting to area 17 were found to be restricted to those cortical regions that project to area 17 in the adult. The projection to area 17 in the neonate did appear to be very different in that in the superior temporal sulcus there was a large contingent of labeled neurons in supragranular layers. This constitutes a transient projection because in the adult area 17 projecting neurons in this cortical region originate almost exclusively from infragranular layers. To test if a change in the laminar distribution of area 17 projecting neurons in extrastriate cortex is a general feature of postnatal development, we have computed in neonates and adults the proportion of area 17 afferent neurons in infra- and supragranular layers for each cortical region that projects to area 17. This revealed (i) that in the adult the laminar distribution of area 17 afferents is characteristic for each cortical area and (ii) that this distribution emerges during development from an immature state in which labeled neurons are more numerous in supragranular layers. These results show that there is an extensive remodeling of the neuronal circuitry connecting visual cortical areas during postnatal development in the monkey and that the transient connectivity of primate area 17 is very different from that observed in other mammalian species.\r"

  ".W": "A central theme in neurobiology is the search for the mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Since the seminal work, first of Cajal and later of Hebb, the synapse is thought to be the basic \"storing unit.\" Hebb proposed that information is stored by correlation: synapses between neurons, which are often coactive, are enhanced. Several recent findings suggest that such a mechanism is indeed operative in the central nervous system. Pairing of activity on presynaptic fibers with strong postsynaptic depolarization results in synaptic enhancement. While there is substantial evidence in favor of a postsynaptic locus for detection of the synchronous pre- and postsynaptic event and subsequent initiation of synaptic enhancement, the locus of this enhancement and its ensuing persistence is still disputed: both pre- and postsynaptic contributions have been suggested. In all previous studies, the enhancement was presumed to be specific to the synapses where synchronous pre- and postsynaptic stimulation was applied. We report here that two recording techniques--optical recording, using voltage-sensitive dyes, and double intracellular recordings--reveal that synaptic enhancement is not restricted to the stimulated cell. Although we paired single afferent volleys with intracellular stimulation confined to one postsynaptic cell, we found that strengthening also occurred on synapses between the stimulated presynaptic fibers and neighboring cells. This suggests that synaptic enhancement by the \"paired-stimulation paradigm\" is not local on the presynaptic axons and that, in fact, the synapses of many neighboring postsynaptic cells are enhanced.\r"

Sequence analysis of this gene and its corresponding cDNA showed that the EH gene is 7.8 kilobases and consists of three exons. Exon I is totally nontranslated; exon II contains a 26-amino acid signal peptide and amino acids 1-4 of the EH peptide, and exon III encodes the remainder of the peptide. The EH gene is present in a single copy per haploid genome and transcribes an 0.8-kb mRNA that is expressed in larval, diapausing pupal, and developing adult brains but not in the ventral nerve cord or in nonneural tissues. In situ hybridization showed that the EH gene is expressed in two pairs of ventromedial neurosecretory cells in brains of both larvae and developing adults.\r"

The X chromosome-linked human disorder Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of disorders that demonstrate a striking failure of oligodendrocyte differentiation. This disease appears pathologically and genetically to be similar to the disorder seen in the dysmyelinating mouse mutant jimpy, which has a point mutation in the gene encoding an abundant myelin protein, proteolipid protein (PLP). We report that the molecular defect in one Pelizaeus-Merzbacher family is likewise a point mutation in the PLP gene. A single T----C transition results in the substitution of a charged amino acid residue, arginine, for tryptophan in one of the four extremely hydrophobic domains of the PLP protein. The identification of a mutation in this Pelizaeus-Merzbacher family should facilitate the molecular classification and diagnosis of these X chromosome-linked human dysmyelinating disorders.\r"

The channel responds to histamine concentrations of 1 microM or more, is permeable primarily to Cl-, is more active at depolarized potentials, and has a conductance of 44 pS in the American lobster and 66 pS in the Caribbean spiny lobster. The expression of this ligand-gated channel in olfactory receptor neurons implies that these neurons are targets of a regulatory or feedback process.\r"

Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to construct and screen rat liver cDNA libraries, and three clones were isolated and sequenced. The 2 kilobases of DDC cDNA cloned consisted of a 5'-noncoding segment of 78 nucleotides, a coding region of 1440 nucleotides, and a 3'-noncoding region of 438 nucleotides. The encoded protein of 480 amino acid residues had a molecular weight of 54,000. A special feature of the primary structure of rat DDC was a repeating structure consisting of 29 amino acid residues. A sequence of 58 amino acid residues, including this repeating structure of rat DDC, was found to show homologies with those of rat tyrosine hydroxylase, human dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and bovine phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, other mammalian enzymes that synthesize catecholamines. These results indicate that catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes are structurally related and suggest that their homologous domains are important for catechol-protein interactions.\r"

Of six antibodies directed against different intracellular domains of the sodium channel alpha subunit, only an antibody directed against a highly conserved intracellular segment between homologous transmembrane domains III and IV induced late single channel openings and prolonged single channel open times during depolarizing test pulses, resulting in nearly complete inhibition of sodium channel inactivation. The antibody effect was not observed if the membrane patches were depolarized to inactivate sodium channels before exposure to the antibody, indicating that the intracellular sequence recognized by the antibody is rendered inaccessible by inactivation. The results show that a conformational change involving the intracellular segment between domains III and IV of the alpha subunit of the sodium channel molecule is required for fast sodium channel inactivation and suggest that this segment may be the fast inactivation gate of the sodium channel.\r"

Evidence in support of the hypothesis includes the following: MTs are ubiquitous and vital cell components, unequally distributed, with the highest concentration in the brain; various abnormalities, including the key neuropathologic lesions, can be explained by impairments of the MT system; and experiments utilizing pharmacologic agents known to disrupt MTs have reproduced certain abnormalities observed in AD. The hypothesis provides a framework for systematic investigations of MTs at the cellular and molecular levels as well as the basis for in vivo diagnostic tests for AD.\r"

We discuss the results of searches for three sample pharmacophores. Two have been proposed by others based on the conformational analysis of active compounds, and one is inferred from the crystal structure of a protein-ligand complex. These examples show that such searches can identify classes of compounds that are structurally different from the compounds from which the pharmacophore was derived but are known to have the appropriate biological activity. Occasionally, the searches find bond \"frameworks\" in which the important groups are rigidly held in the proper geometry. These may suggest new structural classes for synthesis.\r"

One major difference is that tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant cardiac Na+ channels are blocked by 1-10 microM TTX, whereas TTX-sensitive nerve Na+ channels are blocked by nanomolar TTX concentrations. We constructed a cDNA library from 6-day-old rat hearts, where only low-affinity [3H]saxitoxin receptors, corresponding to TTX-resistant Na+ channels, were detected. We isolated several overlapping cDNA clones encompassing 7542 nucleotides and encoding the entire alpha subunit of a cardiac-specific Na+ channel isoform (designated rat heart I) as well as several rat brain I Na+ channel cDNA clones. The derived amino acid sequence of rat heart I was highly homologous to, but distinct from, previous Na+ channel clones. RNase protection studies showed that the corresponding mRNA species is abundant in newborn and adult rat hearts, but not detectable in brain or innervated skeletal muscle. The same mRNA species appears upon denervation of skeletal muscle, likely accounting for expression of new TTX-resistant Na+ channels. Thus, this cardiac-specific Na+ channel clone appears to encode a distinct TTX-resistant isoform and is another member of the mammalian Na+ channel multigene family, found in newborn heart and denervated skeletal muscles.\r"

Immunochemical analysis of overlapping, synthetic octapeptides covering the capsid protein of the Johnsongrass strain of Johnsongrass mosaic virus (JGMV-JG) has delineated the peptide sequences recognized by five polyclonal rabbit antisera and two mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The antibodies characterized were (i) three virus-specific rabbit polyclonal antisera and one virus-specific mouse mAb (1/25) raised against native virus particles, (ii) one polyclonal antiserum raised against trypsin-derived core particles of JGMV-JG, (iii) one group-specific polyclonal antiserum raised against the denatured, truncated coat protein from trypsin-derived core particles of JGMV-JG, and (iv) one group-specific mouse mAb (1/16) raised against native virus particles.

The group-specific epitope seen in JGMV-JG by mAb 1/16 was also recognized strongly in potato virus Y, the type member of the potyvirus group. The multiple epitopes seen by the cross-reactive polyclonal antisera were distributed across the entire core region of the coat protein and their relative antibody binding responses varied between JGMV-JG, potato virus Y, and six other distinct potyviruses.\r"

Here we describe the identification of an IL-6 responsive element (IL-6RE) present in the promoter of the human hemopexin gene.

A liver-specific nuclear protein (IL-6DBP) binds to the hemopexin IL-6RE as well as to similar sequences on the promoter of other acute-phase genes.

The predicted S. mansoni HMG-CoA reductase protein contains a hydrophobic amino terminus consisting of seven potential transmembrane domains that are structurally conservative but are not identical in amino acid sequence with HMG-CoA reductases from other species. The hydrophilic carboxyl terminus of the S. mansoni HMG-CoA reductase protein, however, shares 48-52% sequence identity with the carboxyl termini of other HMG-CoA reductases in a region that contains the catalytic domain. When expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the schistosome protein exhibits HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity.\r"

Antibodies recognizing native PDGF receptors through peptide-domain epitopes coprecipitated 4-fold more PLC activity with receptors from PDGF-stimulated than from unstimulated BALB/c 3T3 cells, despite equivalent PDGF receptor recovery. Activity coprecipitated from unstimulated cells was comparable to nonspecific activity recovered with preimmune sera or in the presence of competing peptide immunogen. PLC activity coprecipitating with PDGF receptors represented 60% of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-recovered activity from PDGF-stimulated cells. Coprecipitation was rapidly induced in cells treated with PDGF at 4 degrees C, reversibly lost with acid dissociation of PDGF from receptors, and recovered with PDGF readdition. PDGF concentrations effecting coprecipitation correlated with stimulation of intact-cell inositol phosphate production. Monoclonal antibodies to PLC gamma (145 kDa) coprecipitated from PDGF-stimulated cell lysates (but not from unstimulated cell lysates) tyrosine kinase activity that phosphorylated PDGF receptor and PLC gamma. Stable physical association of PDGF receptors with PLC may participate in coupling ligand binding to increased PLC activity.\r"

  ".W": "A rationale for the antitumor activity of 4-methoxy- and 4-amino-8-(beta-D-ribofuranosylamino)pyrimido-[5,4-d]pyrimidine (beta-MRPP and beta-ARPP, respectively) was studied by a molecular modeling method. Although these nucleoside analogues are structurally different from adenosine, they act as substrates for adenosine kinase. The molecular modeling method, which considered the three-dimensional structure and atom-based physicochemical properties of the nucleosides to quantify the molecular similarities, showed that certain low-energy conformations of the beta anomers of a series of nucleosides including beta-MRPP, beta-ARPP, and their 4-hydroxy, 4-amino-6-chloro, 4-methylthio-2,6-dichloro, 4,6-diamino, 4-dimethylamino, 4-methylamino, and 4-hydroxy-2,6-dichloro analogues have remarkable structural similarity to adenosine. The method also suggested that the selection of the reference compound adenosine in the structural comparison is of primary importance to gain insight into the observed antitumor activity. The success of the present method led to AM1 (Austin model 1) molecular orbital calculations and experimental studies indicating that the antitumor activity of the alpha anomer of ARPP is probably due to equilibration to the beta anomer. The AM1 calculation of the protonation energy of N5 of pyrimido[5,4-d]pyrimidines, which occupies the same position in space as the N1 of adenosine, gave a direct correlation between the basicity of the nitrogen with a lone pair of electrons and the observed antitumor activity.\r"

  ".W": "The cytochrome P-450 superfamily of enzymes catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of innumerable lipophilic compounds (e.g., drugs, carcinogens, steroids). Although the three-dimensional structure of a soluble bacterial P-450 (P-450cam) has been solved, little is known about the structures of the membrane-bound mammalian P-450s. Thus, the structural features of these enzymes that determine their multisubstrate specificity are unknown. In this report, we identify a segment of the primary structure of the structurally similar but functionally distinct cytochromes P-450IIC5 and P-450IIC4, which determines the apparent affinity of these cytochromes for the conversion of progesterone into the mineralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone. P-450IIC5 exhibits a greater than 10-fold lower apparent Km than P-450IIC4 for progesterone 21-hydroxylation. Chimeric cDNAs were constructed and expressed in COS-1 cells, which encode hybrids between these enzymes. The hybrid enzymes were assayed for catalytic activity and compared to the parental proteins. A segment of P-450IIC5 was identified that conferred the lower Km of P-450IIC5 to P-450IIC4. Sequential reduction of the length of the exchanged segments led to a hybrid enzyme with a high affinity derived largely from P-450IIC4, which contains three amino acid residues derived from P-450IIC5 clustered between positions 113 and 118. This suggests that this region is part of a substrate binding domain. This region maps by alignment of amino acid sequences to a residue of P-450cam, which has been implicated in substrate binding, suggesting that these segments of the primary structure serve a similar functional role in these two distantly related proteins.\r"

We characterized the cap structure of human U6 snRNA and show that the gamma phosphate of the 5' guanosine triphosphate is methylated. The mobilities of in vivo-modified gamma phosphate from the 5' end of HeLa U6 RNA were identical to the synthetic monomethyl phosphate (CH3-O-P) in two-dimensional chromatography and two-dimensional electrophoresis.

PN-1 was recently shown to be identical to a glial-derived neurite-promoting factor/glial-derived nexin present in rat brain. Its neurite outgrowth activity depends on inhibition of thrombin, presumably because thrombin brings about neurite retraction. Here we show that human brain contains PN-1 and that PN-1 activity in brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) was only 14% of control values (total of 14 AD patients and 7 control individuals). PN-1 activity in the hippocampus, a region with marked neuropathology in AD, was 15% of control values (10 AD patients and 4 control individuals). Western blot analysis indicated a large decrease in free PN-1 protein and an increase in PN-1-containing complexes that comigrated with PN-1-thrombin complexes. Northern blot analysis indicated that PN-1 mRNA levels were about equal in brains from AD patients and control individuals. Thus these results suggest that the decreases in PN-1 activity and free PN-1 protein are due to formation of PN-1-protease complexes.\r"

The CRE has two factor-binding sites, region I and region II, both of which elicit enhancer function. By screening a mouse lambda gt 11 library with the CRE as a probe, we isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a protein capable of binding to region II of the CRE. This protein, H-2RIIBP (H-2 region II binding protein), bound to the native region II sequence, but not to other MHC cis-acting sequences or to mutant region II sequences, similar to the naturally occurring region II factor in mouse cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of H-2RIIBP revealed two putative zinc fingers homologous to the DNA-binding domain of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors. Although sequence similarity in other regions was minimal, H-2RIIBP has apparent modular domains characteristic of the nuclear hormone receptors. Further analyses showed that both H-2RIIBP and the natural region II factor bind to the estrogen response element (ERE) of the vitellogenin A2 gene. The ERE is composed of a palindrome, and half of this palindrome resembles the region II binding site of the MHC CRE. These results indicate that H-2RIIBP (i) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors and (ii) may regulate not only MHC class I genes but also genes containing the ERE and related sequences. Sequences homologous to the H-2RIIBP gene are widely conserved in the animal kingdom. H-2RIIBP mRNA is expressed in many mouse tissues, in agreement with the distribution of the natural region II factor.\r"

The affinity-purified receptor preparations contained a single class of high-affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled human choriogonadotropin, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 x 10(-9) M, which is comparable to the Kd values for membrane-bound and solubilized receptors. The purified receptor appeared as two dominant bands with molecular weights of 135,000 and 92,000 after sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) under nonreducing conditions. These two bands were also detected in subsequent direct ligand blotting analysis when the purified receptor was electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane after SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions. When the individual affinity-purified receptor bands were electroeluted from the gel and analyzed again by SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions, both the Mr 92,000 and the 135,000 proteins retained their original molecular form even when 8 M urea was included in the gel. However, when the electrophoretically purified Mr 92,000 and 135,000 bands were subjected to SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions, the Mr 135,000 species was almost completely converted to a Mr 92,000 band, but the Mr 92,000 species did not undergo any alteration in molecular weight. The results suggest that the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor from rat ovary exists in two molecular forms, and the higher molecular weight form appears to be composed of disulfide-linked Mr 92,000 subunit, which comprises the hormone-binding domain.\r"

By using site-directed mutagenesis, charged amino acids in bovine rhodopsin transmembrane helix C were systematically replaced. Substitution of glutamic acid-134 or arginine-135 did not affect spectral properties. However, substitution of glutamic acid-122 by glutamine or by aspartic acid formed pigments that were blue-shifted in light absorption (lambda max = 480 nm and 475 nm, respectively). While the substitution of glutamic acid-113 by aspartic acid gave a slightly red-shifted pigment (lambda max = 505 nm), replacement by glutamine formed a pigment that was strikingly blue-shifted in light absorption (lambda max = 380 nm). The 380-nm species existed in a pH-dependent equilibrium with a 490-nm species such that at acidic pH all of the pigment was converted to lambda max = 490 nm. We conclude that glutamic acid-113 serves as the retinylidene Schiff base counterion in rhodopsin. We believe that this opsin-chromophore interaction is an example of a general mechanism of color regulation in the visual pigments.\r"

Thus, each receptor is independently capable of coupling with mitogenic signal-transduction pathways inherently present in these cells. Activation of either receptor also resulted in chemotaxis, alterations in inositol lipid metabolism, and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The magnitude of these functional responses correlated well with the binding properties of the different PDGF isoforms to each receptor. Thus, availability of specific PDGF isoforms and relative expression of each PDGF-receptor gene product are major determinants of the spectrum of known PDGF responses.\r"

In-IGF-BP thus purified appeared to be homogeneous and unique by the following criteria. (i) N-terminal sequence analysis yielded a unique sequence (Asp-Glu-Ala-Ile-His-Cys-Pro-Pro-Glu-Ser-Glu-Ala-Lys-Leu-Ala).

In-IGF-BP inhibited basal, IGF-stimulated bone cell proliferation and serum-stimulated bone cell proliferation. Forskolin increased synthesis of In-IGF-BP in TE85 human osteosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner.

USA 83, 8069-8072] proposed that the delta CP degree of protein folding could be used to quantify the contribution of the burial of nonpolar surface (the hydrophobic effect) to the stability of a globular protein. We demonstrate that identical correlations between the delta CP degree and the change in water-accessible nonpolar surface area (delta Anp) are obtained for both the transfer of nonpolar solutes from water to the pure liquid phase and the folding of small globular proteins: delta CP degree/delta Anp = -(0.28 +/- 0.05) (where delta Anp is expressed in A2 and delta CP degree is expressed in cal.mol-1.K-1; 1 cal = 4.184 J). The fact that these correlations are identical validates the proposals by both Sturtevant and Baldwin that the hydrophobic effect is in general the dominant contributor to delta CP degree and provides a straightforward means of estimating the contribution of the hydrophobic driving force (delta Ghyd degree) to the standard free energy change of a noncovalent process characterized by a large negative delta CP degree in the physiological temperature range: delta Ghyd degree congruent to (80 +/- 10)delta CP degree.\r"

The bleach does not recover on the time scale of a few picoseconds but does recover by approximately 4% within 1 ns, which suggests that a barrier to recombination is formed within a few picoseconds. The CO spectrum does not change significantly between 300 fs and 1 ns, suggesting that the CO quickly finds some locations in the heme pocket that are not more than a few angstroms from the iron. The de-ligated CO appears in its ground vibrational level. There is evidence that 85 +/- 10% of this CO remains in the heme pocket at 1 ns; it probably resides there for 50 ns.

Initially, the RNase A molecules lie flat-on the mica with their smallest axis perpendicular to and their active site facing the surface. As adsorption proceeds, the molecules slowly reorient until at long times they lie end-on with their largest axis perpendicular to the surface and their active site partially exposed to the free solution. A translational diffusion process is indicated for the phase transition and molecular reorientation of the RNase A molecules.\r"

In this study, volume changes of cells of the J774 murine macrophage-like cell line were monitored by recording the intensity of light scattered by the cells. We investigated the effects of several inhibitors of glucose transport on cell membrane osmotic water permeability as calculated from the rates of cell volume change. Cytochalasin B (2.5 micrograms/ml), phloretin (20 microM), and tomatine (3 microM) reversibly blocked glucose uptake into these cells. All three inhibitors reversibly decreased the osmotic water permeability of J774 cells from 89.6 +/- 3.2 to 27.2 +/- 1.4 microns/sec. We conclude that a major component of the osmotic water flow across the plasma membranes of these cells is accounted for by water traversing their glucose transporters.\r"

This construction was introduced into tobacco cells via a Ti plasmid-based vector. Northern blot analysis of transgenic plants demonstrated the presence of an RNA of the size expected from the construction of pPB-3, and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a protein that comigrated with authentic HC, indicating that the proteolytic activity necessary to produce mature-sized HC was encoded by pPB-3.

PGs that did not affect K562 cell replication did not induce p74 synthesis. p74 was found to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm of PG-treated cells, but moderate amounts were found also in dense areas of the nucleus after PGJ2 treatment. p74 synthesis was not necessarily associated with cytotoxicity or with inhibition of cell protein synthesis. The results described support the hypothesis that synthesis of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins is associated with changes in cell proliferation. The observation that PGs can induce the synthesis of heat shock proteins expands our understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds whose regulatory role is well known in many physiological phenomena, including the control of fever production.\r"

The carotid artery was then denuded of endothelium with a 2 French balloon catheter, after which no platelets were found adhering to the exposed subendothelium. In control animals, platelets adhered instantly to the denuded artery. Six hours after denudation mRNA for ornithine decarboxylase, a marker for early G1 events, was found to be elevated in both thrombocytopenic and control arteries. Two days after injury the smooth muscle cell replication rate in thrombocytopenic rats was found to be significantly elevated as compared with that in uninjured carotids (13.7% +/- 8.4% vs. 0.65% +/- 0.23%) but was similar to the replication rate observed in denuded carotid arteries from animals treated with nonimmune IgG. One important difference between these animals was that no intimal thickening was observed in thrombocytopenic animals at day 4, and by day 7 the intimas were still significantly smaller than those from control rats. In a separate group of animals which were thrombocytopenic for the entire experiment, no intimal lesions were observed 7 days after injury by balloon catheter. From these results, we conclude that platelets do not play a role in the initiation of smooth muscle cell proliferation after injury by balloon catheter but may regulate their movement into the intima.\r"

The effect of TNF-alpha on the phosphorylation state of p28 was rapid (4-fold increase within 15 min) and persistent, remaining above the basal level for at least 2 hr. The specific binding of 125I-labeled TNF-alpha to cell-surface binding sites, the stimulation of p28 phosphorylation by TNF-alpha, and the inhibition of cell proliferation by TNF-alpha occurred with nearly identical dose-response relationships. Two-dimensional SDS/PAGE resolved p28 into two isoforms having pI values of 6.2 and 6.1. A phosphorylated cap-binding protein was substantially enriched from lysates of control or TNF-alpha-treated ME-180 cells by affinity chromatography with 7-methylguanosine 5'-triphosphate-Sepharose. The phosphoprotein recovered from this procedure was the substrate for TNF-alpha-promoted phosphorylation, p28. Thus, TNF-alpha stimulates the phosphorylation of this mRNA cap-binding protein, which may be involved in the transduction of TNF-alpha-receptor binding into cellular responses.\r"

Cellular binding at 4 degrees C of 125I-labeled human recombinant ANG was time and concentration dependent, reversible, and saturable in the presence of increasing amounts of the unlabeled molecules. The interaction was shown to be specific since a large excess of unlabeled ANG reduced labeled ANG binding by 80%, whereas similar doses of RNase A, a structurally related protein, had no effect. Scatchard analyses of binding data revealed two apparent components. High-affinity sites with an apparent dissociation constant of 5 x 10(-9) M were shown to represent cell-specific interactions. The second component, comprising low-affinity/high-capacity sites with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.2 x 10(-6) M, was essentially associated with pericellular components. High-affinity ANG binding sites varied with cell density and were found on other endothelial cells from bovine aorta, cornea, and adrenal cortex capillary but not on Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. Divalent copper, a modulator of angiogenesis, was found to induce a severalfold increase in specific cell-bound radioactivity. Placental ribonuclease inhibitor, a tight-binding inhibitor of both ribonucleolytic and angiogenic activities of ANG, abolished 125I-labeled human recombinant ANG binding only in the absence of copper.\r"

To determine the nature and location of sequences controlling this expression, transgenic mice with various lengths of the human PGK2 5' region fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were analyzed for expression. A 323-base-pair region 5' to the coding region was found to contain information essential for both tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression of the CAT reporter gene. Transgenic mice containing a PGK2/luciferase-coding construct were compared with mice containing an equivalent CAT construct. Luciferase gene expression was also testis-specific and was more sensitive than CAT gene expression, but otherwise regulation of the two reporter genes was similar in the germ cells of transgenic mice. Translation of both PGK2/CAT and PGK2/luciferase fusion genes was seen concurrently with the first detectable transcripts.\r"

This process has not taken place randomly; instead, the expansion of the modern segment has been progressive from 3' to 5' end, thus adding vectorially regions that have been defined as early, middle, and late. The relatedness of the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla may be analyzed with greatest sensitivity by comparing their middle regions. The chimpanzee involucrin gene is more closely related to that of the gorilla than to that of the human.\r"

The present studies characterize the human and mouse cDNAs and indicate that the MEA gene is conserved at both nucleic acid and protein levels. The corresponding mRNA encodes proteins of 18-20 kDa. The phylogenetic conservation could be extended to other mammalian species by Southern blot analysis. Although the Mea gene was transcribed as a 1-kilobase mRNA in most tissues, it was expressed at the highest level in adult testis. The testis-enhanced expression of the Mea gene was associated with germ cell development at late stages of spermatogenesis. Chromosome walking experiments identified two linked genes, A and B, located within 38 kilobases of human genomic sequence. Like the MEA gene, genes A and B were coordinately transcribed in the testis, which suggests that MEA and genes A and B are members of a gene family. In situ hybridization studies localized the MEA gene to the short arm of human chromosome 6 at band p21.1-21.3, close to the major histocompatibility complex locus. The genetic conservation and testis-specific expression of the MEA gene support the hypothesis that it plays an important role in mammalian spermatogenesis and/or testis development.\r"

Transcriptional and translational reporter gene fusions were identified by screening for APH(3')II enzyme activity in diverse tissues of transgenic plants. The frequency of gene fusions, estimated by determination of the copy number of T-DNA insertions, showed that on average 30% of T-DNA inserts induced gene fusions in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana. Gene fusions were rescued from plants by transformation of the T-DNA-linked plasmid and flanking plant DNA into Escherichia coli. By dissection of gene fusions and construction of chimeric genes, callus- and root-specific promoters were identified that showed an altered tissue specificity in the presence of a 3'-downstream-located 35S promoter.

Deficiency of STS (steryl-sulfatase; steryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase, EC 3.1.6.2) activity produces the syndrome of X chromosome-linked ichthyosis, which is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism in man. Approximately 90% of STS- individuals have large deletions at the STS locus. We and others have found that the end points of such deletions are heterogeneous in their location. One recently ascertained subject was observed to have a 40-kilobase deletion that is entirely intragenic, permitting the cloning and sequencing of the deletion junction. Studies of this patient and of other X chromosome sequences in other subjects permit some insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for generating frequent deletions on the short arm of the X chromosome.\r"

We have applied this protocol in producing a library of mouse chromosome 16, consisting of 14,200 clones or two \"chromosome equivalents.\" Each clone occupies an individual well in a microtiter tray, allowing the entire library to be repeatedly and reproducibly plated and analyzed by hybridization. Further, we have established a protocol for making cDNA probes specifically depleted of highly repetitive sequences for probing libraries of genomic clones. By screening the chromosome 16 library with cDNA probes from mouse liver and brain, we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying expressed sequences and characterizing their patterns of expression.

Most (20/21) stable transformants contained only recombinant linear palindromic rDNA molecules carrying rDNA sequences from both the donor plasmid and the recipient cell, as shown previously. However, in one transformant, the circular plasmid initially outreplicated the endogenous rDNA and was the major rDNA form for up to 65 generations. Stable circular replicons have not been reported previously in Tetrahymena. A single point mutation (+G) was identified in the repeated promoter of the plasmid maintained in this transformant. After recovery from the Tetrahymena transformant and recloning in Escherichia coli, the mutated circular plasmid again transformed Tetrahymena with stable maintenance of the circular rDNA plasmid. Transformants containing circular replicons were also obtained by using a similar plasmid from which the repeated promoter, but not the repeated replication origin, had been removed by BAL-31 deletion. We therefore propose that repeated rRNA promoters are deleterious in vivo in Tetrahymena, which normally lacks them. Transformants were obtained in 2-5 days compared with the 7-14 days required for transformation with unmutated rDNA plasmids by recombination. Similar results were obtained when a 550-base-pair segment containing the telomerase RNA gene of T. thermophila was inserted in the polylinker of the plasmid. We suggest that this plasmid is a useful vector system for transformation of Tetrahymena.\r"

While much is known about the recognition and processing of antigens, the nature of T-cell recognition sites on MHC molecules is poorly understood. Both structural and functional studies have suggested that the two major alpha-helical regions of the class I MHC molecule not only define the site for binding of antigenic peptide but also provide potential sites for interaction of the MHC molecule with the T-cell receptor. A peptide derived from one of these regions on the H-2Kb molecule, peptide Kb163-174, was previously shown to specifically inhibit the stimulation of an alloreactive T-cell hybridoma. To further investigate the role of this region in the recognition of H-2Kb, the effects of peptide Kb163-174 on allospecific T-cell lines and clones were studied. When peptide Kb163-174 was cocultured with either an H-2Kbm10 anti-H-2Kb cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone or a CTL line, this peptide inhibited lysis of H-2Kb targets. Pretreatment experiments showed that the blockade was due to interaction of the peptide with the effector T cells. Surprisingly, peptide Kb163-174 also inhibited lysis of H-2Kb targets by H-2Kbm1-, H-2Kbm3-, H-2Kbm6, and H-2Kbm8-anti-H-2Kb CTLs. These CTLs, which identify multiple antigenic sites on H-2Kb in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains, are not directed against amino acid residues 163-174 of H-2Kb. In addition, peptide Kb163-174 specifically blocked lysis of only H-2Kb and not H-2Ld targets by a single bulk CTL culture that was alloreactive on both H-2Kb and H-2Ld. These results indicate that peptide Kb163-174 interferes with T-cell receptor engagement of a contact site on the H-2Kb molecule. Thus, amino acid residues 163-174 define a site used by many alloreactive T cells to engage the H-2Kb molecule.\r"

Transient transfection studies employing internally deleted forms of the IL-2R alpha promoter localized a negative regulatory element (NRE) between nucleotides -400 and -368 relative to the major distal transcription start (cap) site. This 31-base-pair (bp) element is involved in the attenuation of both basal and inducible IL-2R alpha promoter activity. Comparison of this IL-2R alpha NRE with other known regulatory motifs revealed an 11-bp core element (TTCATCCCAGG) that was strikingly similar to a protein-binding domain within the long terminal repeat of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). This viral domain has been previously implicated in the negative control of HIV-1 gene expression. In vitro protein-DNA binding studies demonstrated that the same constitutively expressed approximately 50-kDa protein (SP-50) specifically bound to both the IL-2R alpha and HIV-1 NRE core elements. Mutation of the 11-bp IL-2R alpha NRE core element, which disrupted protein binding, significantly augmented basal as well as Tax protein- or phorbol ester-induced IL-2R alpha promoter activity in vivo, suggesting that SP-50 functions as a transcriptional silencer.\r"

Through the use of an L3T4-negative murine T-cell hybridoma infectant expressing the human CD4 gene and having antigen specificity for HLA-DR, we show that binding of the Ti-CD3 complex with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody induces its redistribution proximal to cell-surface CD4. FRET efficiency was 9.4% on cells labeled with rhodaminated anti-CD3 and fluoresceinated anti-CD4. FRET was found to be temperature dependent, since similarly treated cells held at 4 degrees C displayed a FRET efficiency of less than 1%. Energy transfer was evident within 3 min after warming cells to 37 degrees C. Energy transfer was not detected between Ti-CD3 and the abundantly expressed leukocyte common antigen (CD45). Of greater significance was our observation that hybridomas infected with a truncated CD4 gene lacking the cytoplasmic domain failed to transfer energy despite the fact that CD4 was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to or greater than the wild type. These studies suggest that after crosslinking of the Ti-CD3 on CD4+ T cells, a physical association occurs between the antigen receptor complex and CD4 and that the association is dependent upon the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of CD4.\r"

Using four homeobox probes from the HOX2 locus and a previously undescribed homeobox cDNA (PL1), we screened mRNAs from 18 human leukemic cell lines representing erythroid, myeloid, and T- and B-cell lineages. Complex patterns of lineage-restricted expression are observed: some are restricted to a single lineage, while others are expressed in multiple lineages. No single homeobox gene is expressed in all types of hematopoietic cells, but each cell type exhibits homeobox gene expression. HOX2.2 and -2.3 homeobox-containing cDNAs were cloned from an erythroleukemia cell (HEL) cDNA library, while the homeobox cDNA PL1 was isolated from a monocytic cell (U-937) library. Differentiation of HEL and K-562 cells with various inducers results in modulation of specific homeobox transcripts. In addition, HOX2.2 is expressed in normal bone marrow cells. We have demonstrated (i) lineage-restricted expression of five homeobox genes in erythroid and monocytic cell lines; (ii) expression of additional homeobox genes in other cell lineages (HL-60 and lymphoid cells); (iii) expression of one homeobox gene in normal marrow cells; and (iv) modulation of expression during differentiation. These data suggest that these genes play a role in human hematopoietic development and lineage commitment.\r"

Numerous nerve cells were specifically labeled in preoptic and ventrolateral nuclei of the hypothalamus, as well as in the cornu ammonis region of the hippocampus and throughout all layers of the cerebral cortex, with the highest concentration in layer III. The present results firmly establish that nerve cells constitute the major source in NGF in the brain.

The highest level of hybridization was found in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. High mRNA content was observed in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, the nuclei caudate-putamen and accumbens, and the olfactory tubercle. Lower levels were seen in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area, as well as in the lateral mammillary body. In these areas the distribution was comparable to that of the dopamine D2 receptor binding sites as visualized by autoradiography using [3H]SDZ 205-502 as a ligand. However, in some areas such as the olfactory bulb, neocortex, hippocampus, superior colliculus, and cerebellum, D2 receptors have been visualized but no significant hybridization signal could be detected. The mRNA coding for these receptors in these areas could be contained in cells outside those brain regions, be different from the one recognized by our probes, or be present at levels below the detection limits of our procedure. The possibility of visualizing and quantifying the mRNA coding for dopamine D2 receptor at the microscopic level will yield more information about the in vivo regulation of the synthesis of these receptors and their alteration following selective lesions or drug treatments.\r"

The data show that HIV-1 isolates from the CNS can be distinguished from peripheral blood isolates by their (i) relative inability to infect established T-cell lines, (ii) reduced cytopathogenicity, (iii) inability to modulate CD4 antigen expression on infected cells, (iv) efficient replication in peripheral blood macrophages, and (v) insensitivity to serum neutralization. Paired CNS and peripheral blood isolates from the same individual also display some differences in cellular tropism. The blood isolates replicate better in T-cell lines and glioma cell lines, whereas the paired CNS isolates replicate more efficiently in primary macrophages. These results suggest that viruses isolated from the CNS of infected individuals may represent a specific HIV-1 subgroup.\r"

In contrast, antibodies prepared against peptide CP1, which represents the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues predicted by cloning and sequence analysis of the alpha 1 subunit, recognized a minor, previously undescribed 212-kDa protein, which is the size predicted for the full length of the alpha 1 subunit from cDNA cloning [Tanabe, T., Takeshima, H., Mikami, A., Flockerzi, V., Takahashi, H., Kangawa, K., Kojima, M., Matsuo, H., Hirose, T. & Numa, S. (1987) Nature (London) 328, 313-318]. Both the 175-kDa and 212-kDa forms were phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and both were present in isolated transverse tubule membranes. The 175-kDa form may arise from posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of the C terminus of the 212-kDa form of the alpha 1 subunit predicted by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis. Partial amino acid sequencing of the 54-kDa beta subunit of the calcium channel indicated this protein was not derived from the proteolytically cleaved C terminus of the alpha 1 subunit. This analysis identified a threonine residue in the sequence (Lys/Arg)-Arg-Pro-Thr-Pro of the beta subunit that was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of this residue in the beta subunit may play a role in modulation of calcium channel function. Separate functional roles of the 175-kDa form of the alpha 1 subunit in excitation-contraction coupling and of the 212-kDa form in ion conductance are proposed.\r"

The vectors integrated into and replicated within the respective host genomes. After intrachromosomal replication, the DNA sequence in the vicinity of the originally adducted site of each integrated vector was amplified from the host genome by using the polymerase chain reaction and was analyzed for mutations. High levels of mutation were observed from the O6-methylguanine- and O6-ethylguanine-containing vectors replicated in mex- cells (approximately 19% for O6-methylguanine and approximately 11% for O6-ethylguanine). DNA sequencing revealed the induced mutations to be almost exclusively G----A transitions. By contrast, little or no mutagenesis was detected when the adducted vectors were introduced into mex+ cells, indicating the significant role of the O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase in the repair of O6-methylguanine and O6-ethylguanine in these mammalian cells.\r"

The other three glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes encode mRNAs that have the SL1 but not the SL2 sequence at their 5' ends.

  ".W": "Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the cotranslational linkage of myristate to the N-terminal glycine residues of several cellular, viral, and oncoproteins. We have recently synthesized a series of sulfur- and oxygen-substituted analogs of myristic acid that are similar in length to the 14:0 fatty acid yet have hydrophobicities equivalent to dodecanoate or decanoate. Previous in vitro enzyme assays and metabolic labeling studies indicate that some of these analogs are excellent substrates for NMT and are incorporated into subsets of cellular N-myristoyl proteins. Their sequence-specific incorporation probably arises from cooperative interactions between the acyl CoA and peptide binding sites of NMT. The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) depend on myristoylation of gag polyprotein precursors for assembly. We have tested four analogs--12-methoxydodecanoic acid, 10-propoxydecanoic acid, 5-octyloxypentanoic acid, and 11-ethylthioundecanoic acid--for their ability to block replication of these retroviruses. All reduce HIV-1 replication when incubated with CD4+ H9 cells for 10 days at 10-100 microM. 12-Methoxydodecanoic acid is most effective, producing a concentration-dependent decrease in (i) reverse transcriptase activity (to levels that were 5-10% of control at 20-40 microM), (ii) p24 levels, and (iii) syncytia formation. This degree of inhibition of HIV-1 replication is equivalent to that seen with 5 microM 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and is accomplished without apparent toxicity, as measured by cell viability, protein, and nucleic acid synthesis. 5-Octyloxypentanoic acid inhibits MoMLV assembly in a dose-dependent fashion without accompanying cellular toxicity, while 12-methoxydodecanoic acid has no effect. These data suggest that the use of cellular NMT activity to deliver analogs of myristate with altered physical-chemical properties to proteins that undergo this cotranslational modification may represent an effective anti-viral therapeutic strategy as well as a way to investigate the role of covalently bound fatty acid in viral assembly.\r"

  ".W": "We provide evidence that a plant rhabdovirus, sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV), is similar to most animal rhabdoviruses in the order of structural genes and in the nucleotide sequences at the gene junctions but that it differs in the presence and location of a putative nonstructural gene. From the patterns of hybridization of a library of recombinant DNA clones, we have shown that the SYNV genome is transcribed into a short 3'-terminal \"leader RNA\" and six mRNAs. The proteins encoded by the SYNV mRNAs, in order of the appearance of their genes in the SYNV genome, are designated 3'-N-M2-sc4-M1-G-L-5' (N, nucleoprotein; M, matrix protein; sc, protein encoded by SYNV complementary RNA; G, glycoprotein; L, large protein). The intergenic and flanking gene sequences are conserved and consist of a central core of 14 nucleotides (3'-UUCUUUUUGGUUGU/A-5') whose sequence is similar to the sequence at the gene junctions of vesicular stomatitis and rabies viruses. The SYNV core consists of an 8-nucleotide (3'-UUCUUUUU-5') transcription termination signal at the 5' terminus of each gene, a dinucleotide (GG) spacer whose complement does not appear in mRNA, and a tetranucleotide (3'-UUGU/A-5') that is complementary to the first four nucleotides at the 5' terminus of the SYNV mRNAs. These results, when compared with structural information available on animal rhabdoviruses, suggest that organization of structural genes and maintenance of signals thought to play important roles in regulation of transcription have been conserved during evolution in plant, insect, and vertebrate hosts. However, differences in number and location of putative nonstructural genes reveal some flexibility in genome organization that may be important in deducing taxonomic and evolutionary relationships among viruses causing diseases in phylogenetically diverse hosts.\r"

  ".W": "Polyoma virus medium tumor antigen forms specific complexes with several cellular proteins; among these is a protein of approximately 61 kDa. With antibodies directed against medium tumor antigen, the 61-kDa protein was purified from human 293 cells that were infected with a hybrid adenovirus and overexpressed medium tumor antigen. The purified 61-kDa protein was partially digested with protease V8, and one of the protease V8 fragments was isolated and partially sequenced. The amino acid sequence information was used to design mixed oligonucleotide probes for screening a cDNA library from human placenta. A clone was isolated that hybridized with two separate probes; the clone contained an insert with an open reading frame for 589 amino acids. By in vitro translation of the transcript from this insert, a protein was generated that had the same size and yielded the same pattern of protease V8 fragments as the original 61-kDa protein. Its amino acid sequence reveals 15 repeats, the majority of which are 39 amino acids long. This protein bears no resemblance to proteins in the data bank that was searched.\r"

  ".U": "90046857\r", 
  ".W": "Major progress has been made in elucidating the calcium release mechanism involved in excitation-contraction coupling. The ryanodine receptor of sarcoplasmic reticulum has been isolated and found to be morphologically identical to the foot structure, which is involved in the junctional association of terminal cisternae with the transverse tubule. The foot structure also contains the calcium release channel itself. For this reason, we refer to the foot structure as the junctional channel complex (JCC). The JCC consists of an oligomer of a single high molecular weight protein. Although progress has been made in characterizing important aspects of the structure and function of the JCC, further understanding of the JCC protein subunit awaits the molecular cloning of the JCC. We report on the isolation of cDNA clones encoding portions of the JCC from rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle and its tissue distribution and expression. The large size and lack of solubility of the JCC protein posed particular challenges to cloning this molecule. Among these was the necessity to develop techniques for partially digesting the JCC protein subunit with endoproteases in the presence of detergent. With this approach we obtained partial amino acid sequences from regions of the JCC and designed oligonucleotide primers and probes to synthesize and screen cDNA libraries. The rabbit skeletal muscle JCC mRNA encodes an approximately 16-kilobase mRNA present in skeletal, heart, and aortic smooth muscle, as determined by RNA blot analysis with a 700-base-pair cDNA probe. Whereas the JCC mRNA appears to be relatively abundant in adult rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle, it is much less abundant in heart and smooth muscle. The JCC mRNA in BC3H1 (a myoblast cell line) is reversibly regulated by growth factors in a manner similar to muscle-specific contractile protein genes.\r"

  ".W": "A series of anti-human placental uracil DNA glycosylase monoclonal antibodies was used to screen a human placental cDNA library in phage lambda gt11. Twenty-seven immunopositive plaques were detected and purified. One clone containing a 1.2-kilobase (kb) human cDNA insert was chosen for further study by insertion into pUC8. The resultant recombinant plasmid selected by hybridization a human placental mRNA that encoded a 37-kDa polypeptide. This protein was immunoprecipitated specifically by an anti-human placental uracil DNA glycosylase monoclonal antibody. RNA blot-hybridization (Northern) analysis using placental poly(A)+ RNA or total RNA from four different human fibroblast cell strains revealed a single 1.6-kb transcript. Genomic blots using DNA from each cell strain digested with either EcoRI or Pst I revealed a complex pattern of cDNA-hybridizing restriction fragments. The genomic analysis for each enzyme was highly similar in all four human cell strains. In contrast, a single band was observed when genomic analysis was performed with the identical DNA digests with an actin gene probe. During cell proliferation there was an increase in the level of glycosylase mRNA that paralleled the increase in uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme activity. The isolation of the human uracil DNA glycosylase gene permits an examination of the structure, organization, and expression of a human DNA repair gene.\r"

  ".W": "Two long-standing questions in the control of eukaryotic gene expression have been how the structure of transcribing chromatin compares with that of nontranscribing chromatin and how chromatin structure differs among various eukaryotic organisms. We have addressed aspects of these two questions by characterizing the rotational flexibility of the DNA of the simian virus 40 (SV40) transcription complex. When transcription complex samples are incubated with topoisomerase at 0 degrees C or 37 degrees C, the DNA of the 37 degrees C sample is unwound by 1.8 turns relative to that of the 0 degrees C sample. This amount of unwinding is similar to that observed for bulk, untranscribed SV40 minichromosome DNA, indicating that the chromatin structure of a transcribed gene resembles that of a nontranscribed gene in the degree of constraint that it imposes on its DNA. However, this amount of unwinding differs substantially from the value observed for yeast plasmid chromatin DNA, suggesting that yeast chromatin differs significantly from mammalian chromatin in this fundamental property.\r"

To analyze the gene product(s) of FLG, we have generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide from FLG and used it to immunoprecipitate biosynthetically labeled FLG protein from a variety of human cell lines. These antibodies specifically recognized glycoprotein(s) of 100, 120, and 135 kDa with protein cores of 90 and 110 kDa. Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of FLG in vitro and in living cells, suggesting that FLG encodes the membrane receptor for aFGF. Further supporting evidence came from cross-linking experiments on intact cells with the covalent cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate and 125I-labeled aFGF as a specific probe. The cross-linked 125I-labeled aFGF-aFGF receptor complex was specifically immunoprecipitated with FLG antipeptide antibodies. It appears, therefore, that the receptor(s) for aFGF is related to the FLG gene product.\r"

Cataracts are associated with glutathione deficiency in the lens epithelium, which undergoes severe degeneration. The findings indicate that glutathione normally functions in the protection of the lens and lens epithelium against oxidative injury, suggesting that procedures that increase lens glutathione levels might be useful for prevention of other types of cataracts. Relatively low doses of buthionine sulfoximine produce cataracts in newborn animals, and treatment of pregnant mice with buthionine sulfoximine during the last part of gestation leads to cataract formation in the offspring. The high sensitivity of the developing lens to the effects of glutathione deficiency suggests that this tissue may be a useful model for studies on glutathione function.\r"

  ".W": "Long-range chiral organization of the pigment-protein complexes in mature granal chloroplasts has been established by differential polarization imaging and local circular dichroism spectra. Linear and circular dichroism images of oriented chloroplasts were obtained in a confocal differential polarization microscope. The circular dichroism images display signals of opposite signs emerging from discrete regions with local dichroic values much larger than anticipated, indicating domains in the thylakoid membranes having long-range chiral organization. These domains are associated with positive and negative circular dichroism bands obtained at specific locations on the chloroplasts. Surprisingly, the local circular dichroism spectra do not display the excitonic shape of spectra obtained for macroscopic suspensions, but the latter can be produced by superposition of two local spectra of opposite sign. These data are evidence for the existence of long-range chiral order of the pigment-protein complexes in thylakoid membranes. The possible role of the long-range chiral domains in the efficiency of energy delocalization through the thylakoid membranes is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To test the proposal that ATPase activity is coupled to the rotation of muscle cross-bridges (myosin heads attached to actin), we have used saturation-transfer EPR to detect the rotational motion of spin-labeled myosin heads (subfragment 1; S1) bound to actin following the photolysis of caged ATP (a photoactivatable analog of ATP). In order to ensure that most of the heads were bound to actin in the presence of ATP, solutions contained high (200 microns) actin concentrations and were of low (36 mM) ionic strength. Sedimentation measurements indicated that 52 +/- 2% of the spin-labeled heads were attached in the steady state of ATP hydrolysis during EPR measurements. Five millimolar caged ATP was added to the actin-S1 solution in an EPR cell in the dark, with no effect on the intense saturation-transfer EPR signal, implying a rigid actin-S1 complex. A laser pulse produced 1 mM ATP, which decreased the signal rapidly to a brief steady-state level that indicated only slightly less rotational mobility than that of free heads. After correcting for the fraction of free heads, we conclude that the bound heads have an effective rotational correlation time of 1.0 +/- 0.3 microseconds, which is about 100 times shorter (faster) than that in the absence of ATP. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence that myosin heads undergo rotational motion when bound to actin during the ATPase cycle. It is likely that similar cross-bridge rotations occur during muscle contraction.\r"

The bilayers are prepared from a perdeuterated phospholipid labeled with a pair of 19F atoms at the 7 position of the 2-sn acyl chain. Phospholipid-cholesterol or phospholipid-gramicidin interactions are characterized by measuring the relaxation rates as a function of the bilayer orientation, the locking field, and the temperature. Our studies show that cholesterol or gramicidin can specifically enhance the relaxation due to slow motions in phospholipid bilayers with correlation times tau s longer than 10(-8) sec. The perturbations of the geometry of the slow motions induced by cholesterol are qualitatively different from those induced by gramicidin. In contrast, the presence of cholesterol or gramicidin slightly suppresses the fast motions with correlation times tau f = 10(-9) to 10(-10) sec without significantly affecting their geometry. Weak locking-field and temperature dependences are observed for both pure lipid bilayers and bilayers containing either cholesterol or gramicidin, suggesting that the motions of phospholipid acyl chains may have dispersed correlation times.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-suppressor genes control the neoplastic phenotype of tumor cells, but the function of these genes in normal cells is unknown. In this report we show that the loss of a tumor-suppressor gene function releases negative controls on the growth of cells in agar. This conclusion is based on observations of cell hybrids and studies of cell variants that have retained or lost a tumor-suppressor gene function. Nontumorigenic cell hybrids between normal Syrian hamster embryo cells and a benzo[a]pyrene-transformed tumor-cell line (BP6T) continued to secrete autocrine and/or paracrine growth factors produced by the tumor cells but failed to respond to these factors by growing in agar. Normal diploid cells also failed to grow in agar in response to the growth factors produced by the tumor cells. Clonal variants of nontumorigenic, immortal Syrian hamster cell lines were isolated that either retained (termed supB+) or had lost (termed supB-) the ability to suppress tumorigenicity of BP6T tumor cells after cell hybridization. Neither supB+ nor supB- variants grew in agar under conditions that allowed efficient growth of the tumor cells. However, supB- cells were reversibly induced to grow in agar with high colony-forming efficiencies in the presence of tumor cell-conditioned medium or by supplementation of the medium with a combination of growth factors. Under the same conditions, the supB+ cells failed to grow in agar. This enhanced growth-factor responsiveness in agar was used to select for supB- variants existing at a low frequency in the supB+ population. These two phenotypes, loss of tumor-suppressor function and enhanced growth-factor responsiveness in agar, were seen to cosegregate. These results indicate the tumor-suppressor gene function in these cells negatively regulates the growth response of cells in agar to mitogenic stimuli. This growth regulation may depend on cell shape or adhesion because supB+ and supB- cells grown attached to plastic responded similarly to growth factors.\r"

Hydrocortisone (20 microM) significantly increased synthesis of fibrinogen, as determined by incorporation of [35S]methionine. FDP-D and FDP-E did not increase fibrinogen synthesis in the presence of hydrocortisone. However, hepatocytes cultured without hydrocortisone displayed increased fibrinogen synthesis (2.0- to 2.8-fold) with FDP-D (2.6-6.7 microM) but not with FDP-E (5.7 microM). At these FDP concentrations the synthesis of albumin, haptoglobin, and transferrin was not increased. FDP-D-induced fibrinogen synthesis was inhibited (greater than 90%) by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that the increase in [35S]methionine incorporation was from de novo protein synthesis. The role of FDP-D was further substantiated by showing that FDP-D, but not FDP-E, bound to the hepatocytes. These data indicate that FDP-D, but not FDP-E, directly and specifically stimulates fibrinogen synthesis in rat hepatocytes; this stimulation does not require any additional serum or protein cofactors.\r"

Osteogenin stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis in periosteal cells. The cAMP response to parathyroid hormone in periosteal cells was increased by osteogenin. In primary cultures of calvarial osteoblasts, osteogenin stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity, the cAMP response to parathyroid hormone, and the synthesis of collagenous and noncollagenous proteins; however, cell proliferation was not affected. Osteogenin increased the production of sulfated proteoglycans in fetal rat chondroblasts and in rabbit articular chondrocytes. The present experiments demonstrate the significant influence of osteogenin in the stimulation of osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypes in vitro.\r"

Human apoE was detected in the systemic circulation of graft-bearing animals as long as the graft remained on the animal. Within 24 hr of graft removal, human apoE was not detectable in plasma, indicating that apoE resulted from continuous production of the protein by grafted keratinocytes. These results show that proteins as large as apoE (299 amino acids) traverse the epidermal-dermal barrier and achieve systemic distribution where they may produce effects on distal tissues. The feasibility of using grafts of genetically-altered keratinocytes for the delivery of secreted proteins is clearly reinforced by the demonstration that an epidermally derived protein exhibits systemic distribution. Finally, by virtue of its systemic distribution, apoE produced in a peripheral tissue such as skin, may function in the reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver.\r"

Their actions may be mediated by the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) and the cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). As a step towards understanding the possible function for CRABP and CRBP in morphogenesis, we have used in situ hybridization to analyze their expression during mouse development. Both CRABP and CRBP transcripts were detected at embryonic days 9.5-14.5. (i) In the nervous system, CRABP transcripts were found in the mantle layer of the dorsal spinal cord and hindbrain and in the marginal layer of the midbrain, whereas CRBP transcripts were found in the ependymal and mantle layer of the ventral spinal cord and of the forebrain as well as in the spinal nerves and the roof plate of the spinal cord. (ii) In the eye, CRABP is expressed in the retinal layer, and CRBP is expressed in both retinal and pigmented layers. (iii) In the craniofacial region, CRABP transcripts were found in the mesenchyme of the frontonasal mass and mandible, while CRBP transcripts were found in the mesenchyme of the nasolachrymal duct and surrounding the auditory vesicle. Two general conclusions can be made. First, all of the tissues that are known to be teratogenic targets of retinoic acid and retinol also express CRABP and CRBP transcripts. Second, the specific expression of CRABP and CRBP in numerous developing tissues indicates that these proteins may perform specific functions during morphogenesis of a broad variety of embryonic structures.\r"

The sequences of the amylomaltase gene of all of the strains and of the PBP2B gene of the penicillin-sensitive strain show that S. pneumoniae is genetically very uniform. In contrast the PBP2B genes of the penicillin-resistant strains show approximately equal to 14% sequence divergence from those of the penicillin-sensitive strains and the development of penicillin resistance has involved the replacement, presumably by transformation, of the original PBP2B gene by a homologous gene from an unknown source. This genetic event has occurred on at least two occasions, involving different sources, to produce the two classes of altered PBP2B genes found in penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. There is considerable variation among the PBP2B genes of the resistant strains that may have arisen by secondary transformation events accompanied by mismatch repair subsequent to their original introductions into S. pneumoniae.\r"

  ".W": "Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC), epidemiologically associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, has historically been felt to be caused by the activation or introduction of an oncogene. However, transforming sequences from human PHC have not been reproducibly isolated. In this paper, evidence is presented that suggests PHC may result instead from the loss of an anti-oncogene. Seven of 12 human primary liver tumors tested against a panel of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) demonstrated loss of constitutional heterozygosity for markers on chromosome 4. Tumor and nontumor liver tissue were typed for 11 chromosome 4 RFLPs. In addition, at least one RFLP on nine other chromosomes (1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 17) was tested for allelic loss. Seven of nine tumors constitutionally heterozygous for chromosome 4q markers showed allele loss in tumor tissue. Six of the seven samples were jointly informative for both 4p and 4q markers. Five of the six demonstrated loss for only 4q RFLPs. In one individual, in which two samples were taken from distant locations within the same tumor, both samples showed loss of the same alleles. Among the other chromosomes informative for allele loss, one tumor showed changes on 13q. No other changes were observed in RFLPs located on the eight other chromosomes tested. These results indicate that an anti-oncogene may be located on 4q and suggest a mechanism for PHC and other cancers seroepidemiologically related to virus infection. Liver cancer caused by chronic HBV infection or other environmental agents may be linked through genetic events responsible for the loss of a tumor suppressor locus (anti-oncogene) located on chromosome 4.\r"

To obtain an initial bank of molecular probes for the region of mouse chromosome 7 associated with the albino-deletion complex, random anonymous DNA clones, derived from a library constructed from flow-sorted chromosomes, were screened on DNAs from Mus musculus-Mus spretus F1 hybrids carrying large, multilocus, lethal albino deletions. Clones falling within a given deletion interval can easily be recognized because hybridization bands that represent restriction fragment length polymorphisms specific for the mutant (deleted) chromosome inherited from the M. musculus parent will be absent. Among 72 informative clones used as probes, one, which defines the locus D7OR1, mapped within two deletions that are 6-11 centimorgans in length. Submapping of this anonymous clone across a panel of 27 smaller deletions localized D7OR1 distal to a chromosomal subregion important for survival of the preimplantation embryo, proximal to globin [beta-chain (Hbb)], and near the shaker-1 (sh-1) locus. The results of these deletion-mapping experiments were also confirmed by standard three-point linkage analysis. This strategy for selection and rapid mapping of anonymous DNA probes to chromosomal segments corresponding to germ-line deletion mutations should contribute to the generation of more detailed physical and functional maps of genomic regions associated with mutant developmental phenotypes.\r"

A set of mouse-human hybrid cell lines, each containing a single Ecogpt-marked human chromosome, was used as a source of donor chromosomes. Chromosome transfer to XPTG-1 cells, a hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient mutant of simian virus 40-transformed complementation group A cells, was achieved by microcell fusion and selection for Ecogpt. Chromosome-transfer clones of XPTG-1 cells, each containing a different human donor chromosome, were analyzed for complementation of sensitivity to UV irradiation. Among all the clones, increased levels of resistance to UV was observed only in clones containing chromosome 9. Since our recipient cell line XPTG-1 is hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficient, cultivation of Ecogpt+ clones in medium containing 6-thioguanine permits selection of cells for loss of the marker and, by inference, transferred chromosome 9. Clones isolated for growth in 6-thioguanine, which have lost the Ecogpt-marked chromosome, exhibited a UV-sensitive phenotype, confirming the presence of the repair gene(s) for complementation group A on chromosome 9.\r"

  ".W": "Long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) are transposable elements present in many species. In mammals they are difficult to study because most of them are defective and their transposition frequency is low. The I factor of Drosophila melanogaster is a LINE element that is particularly interesting because its transposition occurs at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis. This phenomenon occurs when males from the class of inducer strains are crossed with females from the class of reactive strains. Inducer strains contain several complete 5.4-kilobase I factors at various sites on the chromosomal arms. Reactive strains are devoid of complete I factors. Many results indicate that active I factors have invaded the D. melanogaster genome recently. To study the evolutionary history of I elements, we have cloned and sequenced a potentially active I factor from Drosophila teissieri. It is flanked by a target-site duplication and terminates at the 3' end by tandem repeats of the sequence TAA. When introduced into the germ line of a reactive strain of D. melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation, it is able to transpose and induces hybrid dysgenesis. This strengthens the hypothesis of a recent reinvasion of the D. melanogaster genome by active I factors giving rise to the inducer strains. They could have originated by horizontal transfer from another species. Such events also could occur for other LINE elements and might explain the spread of new variants in mammalian genomes. Moreover, the results give a further insight into I factor functional organization.\r"

Such stability of expression may depend on vector design, including the presence or absence of specific sequences within the vector, in combination with the nature and efficiency of infection of the hematopoietic target cells. We have previously reported successful transfer of human DNA encoding adenosine deaminase (ADA) into CFU-S (colony-forming unit-spleen) stem cells using simplified recombinant retroviral vectors. Human ADA was expressed in CFU-S-derived spleen colonies at levels near to endogenous enzyme. However, because of the lack of an efficient dominant selectable marker and low recombinant viral titers, stability of long-term expression of human ADA was not examined. We report here the development of an efficient method of infection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) without reliance on in vitro selection. Peripheral blood samples of 100% of mice transplanted with HSC infected by this protocol exhibit expression of human ADA 30 days after transplantation. Some mice (6 of 13) continue to express human ADA in all lineages after complete hematopoietic reconstitution (4 months). The use of recombinant retroviral vectors that efficiently transfer human ADA cDNA into HSC leading to stable expression of functional ADA in reconstituted mice, provides an experimental framework for future development of approaches to somatic gene therapy.\r"

Interleukin 3 (IL-3) was required for CFU-S survival in culture, and the combination of IL-3 and interleukin 6 (IL-6) increased the number of CFU-S in culture 10-fold over the number obtained with IL-3 alone. Stem cell function was measured by competitive repopulation; IL-3 was required, and IL-3 and IL-6 appear to act synergistically to enhance stem cell recovery from these cultures. These data appear to be relevant for retroviral-mediated gene transfer into stem and progenitor cells. Murine bone marrow cells were infected with a retrovirus containing the human beta-globin gene in the presence of various growth factors. Only 2 of 17 mice reconstituted with cells infected in the presence of IL-3 alone showed long-term expression of the human beta-globin gene (12 months), as opposed to 6 of 11 mice reconstituted with cells infected in the presence of IL-3 and IL-6. Medium conditioned by 5637 bladder carcinoma cells, a source of several hematopoietic growth factors, increased the frequency of infection of CFU-S but did not enhance stem cell infection or the repopulating potential of cultured bone marrow cells. Stem cells containing the human beta-globin provirus from these animals were shown to be capable of reconstituting secondary recipients in which the human beta-globin gene was expressed.\r"

High-titer retroviral vectors containing the human GC cDNA were constructed. Mouse bone marrow cells were stimulated with hematopoietic growth factors, infected by coculture with producer cells, and injected into lethally irradiated animals. Four vectors were compared with respect to gene-transfer efficiency into CFU-S progenitors. One vector (G vector) required high concentrations of interleukins 3 and 6 during stimulation and coculture for efficient transduction of CFU-S progenitors. The remaining three vectors (NTG, GTN, and GI vectors) transduced these progenitors at infection frequencies approaching 100% using low concentrations of hematopoietic growth factors to stimulate cell division prior to and during the infection. Vectors using the viral long terminal repeat enhancer/promoter to drive the human GC cDNA produced high levels of human GC RNA in the progeny of CFU-S progenitors after gene transfer. When an internal herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter assisted by a mutant polyoma enhancer was used to drive the human GC cDNA (NTG vector), little or no human GC RNA was detected in transduced CFU-S colonies. All three vectors producing human GC RNA in CFU-S colonies can generate human GC as detected by immunochemical analysis of CFU-S colonies. NTG vector-infected bone marrow cells were transplanted into W/Wv recipients to generate long-term reconstituted mice. The capacity of the viral long terminal repeat and the internal thymidine kinase promoter to direct synthesis of RNA in transduced bone marrow and spleen cells 5 months after bone marrow transplantation reflected the performance of these promoters in NTG-transduced CFU-S colonies.\r"

However, because of the absence of good animal models, it has not been possible to estimate the wavelengths or wavelength regions involved. We have developed a useful animal model from crosses and backcrosses of platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus) and swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri). Two strains of these fish are susceptible to invasive melanoma induction by exposure to filtered radiation from sunlamps in the wavelength ranges lambda greater than 290 nm and lambda greater than 304 nm. Multiple exposures on 5-20 consecutive days beginning on day 5 after birth or a single exposure of approximately 200 J/(m2.day) of lambda greater than 304 nm result in a tumor prevalence of 20% to 40% at 4 months of age compared with a background rate of 12% in one strain and 2% in another. Exposure of the fish to visible light after UV exposure reduces the prevalence to background. The melanomas are similar in many respects to mammalian melanomas, as judged by light and electron microscopy. The genetics of the crosses determined by others and the high sensitivity of the hybrids to melanoma induction indicate that the UV radiation probably inactivates the one tumor repressor gene (or a small number of tumor repressor genes) in the hybrid fish. The small size of the animals and their high susceptibility to melanoma induction make them ideal for action spectroscopy.\r"

Our working hypothesis, based on those findings, is that A alpha-(148-160) is buried in fibrinogen and becomes accessible to proteins such as plasminogen and/or tissue-type plasminogen activator when fibrinogen is converted to fibrin. To test this hypothesis we have raised a monoclonal antibody against synthetic A alpha-(148-160) and found that this antibody reacts with fibrin and not with fibrinogen.

This region is known to encode the tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) alpha and beta, B144, and the major heat shock protein HSP70. Moreover, a cluster of genes, BAT1-BAT5 (HLA-B-associated transcripts) has been localized in the vicinity of the genes for TNF alpha and TNF beta. An additional four genes were identified by isolation of corresponding cDNA clones with cosmid DNA probes. These genes for BAT6-BAT9 were mapped near the gene for C2 within a 120-kb region that includes a HSP70 gene pair. These results, together with complementary data from a similar recent study, indicated the presence of a minimum of 19 genes within the C2-HLA-B interval of the MHC class III region. Although the functional properties of most of these genes are yet unknown, they may be involved in some aspects of immunity. This idea is supported by the genetic mapping of the hemopoietic histocompatibility locus-1 (Hh-1) in recombinant mice between TNF alpha and H-2S, which is homologous to the complement gene cluster in humans.\r"

  ".W": "CD45 is a family of high molecular weight leukocyte cell surface glycoproteins. Recently, two related subregions of the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 have been shown to have 30-40% amino acid identity with a human placental protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase, and CD45 isolated from human spleen was found to exhibit intrinsic protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48) activity. In the present studies, we demonstrate that each of the known isoforms of murine CD45 has an equivalent basal level of protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and establish that this enzymatic activity is associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein. Studies with three independent sets of well-characterized parental CD45+, mutant CD45-, and revertant CD45+ lymphoma cell lines indicate that loss of CD45 increases the phosphorylation of the src-related leukocyte-specific tyrosine protein kinase p56lck on tyrosine-505, a putative negative regulatory site. This suggests that CD45 may play a role in leukocyte growth regulation by altering the kinase activity of p56lck.\r"

Using CCK-JMV-180, a recently developed CCK analog that acts as an agonist at high-affinity CCK receptors but antagonizes the effect of CCK at low-affinity receptors, we have determined that caerulein induces pancreatitis by interacting with low-affinity CCK receptors. Those low-affinity receptors mediate CCK-induced inhibition of digestive enzyme secretion from the pancreas. Our observations, therefore, suggest that this form of experimental pancreatitis results from the inhibition of pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion.\r"

The results show that these two visual functions develop at different rates in normal monkeys and are disrupted differentially by abnormal early visual experience.

The mature hormones are released into the peripheral circulation from the neural (posterior) lobe of the pituitary and have also been implicated in the regulation of anterior lobe. We have used Northern blotting and in situ hybridization to RNA in tissue sections to describe the presence, anatomical localization, and regulation of VP and oxytocin RNAs in the pituitary gland itself. We were unable to detect VP transcripts in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. Rather we found low levels of VP RNA in the neural lobe. Furthermore, the osmotic stimulation of a 2% (wt/vol) NaCl drinking diet resulted in a marked accumulation of VP RNA in the neural lobe. We suggest that VP, locally synthesized in pituicytes, may have paracrine effects on VP receptors in the neural lobe.\r"

  ".U": "90046919\r", 
  ".W": "By use of a sensitive in vitro microsuperfusion method, the cholinergic prsynaptic control of dopamine release was investigated in a prominent striosome (areas poor in acetylcholinesterase activity) located within the core of cat caudate nucleus and also in adjacent matrix area. The spontaneous release of [3H]dopamine continuously synthesized from [3H]tyrosine in the matrix area was found to be twice that in the striosomal area; the spontaneous and potassium-evoked releases of [3H]dopamine were calcium-dependent in both compartments. With 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin, 5 x 10(-5) M acetylcholine stimulated [3H]dopamine release in both striosomal and matrix areas, effects completely antagonized by atropine (10(-6) M), thus showing the involvement of muscarinic receptors located on dopaminergic nerve terminals. Experiments without tetrodotoxin revealed a more complex regulation of dopamine release in the matrix: (i) In contrast to results seen in the striosome, acetylcholine induced only a transient stimulatory effect on matrix dopamine release. (ii) Although 10(-6) M atropine completely abolished the cholinergic stimulatory effect on [3H]dopamine release in striosomal area, delayed and prolonged stimulation of [3H]dopamine release was seen with atropine in the matrix. The latter effect was completely abolished by the nicotinic antagonist pempidine (10(-5) M). Therefore, in the matrix, in addition to its direct (tetrodotoxin-insensitive) facilitatory action on [3H]dopamine release, acetylcholine exerts two indirect (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) opposing effects: an inhibition and a stimulation of [3H]dopamine release mediated by muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, respectively.\r"

A TH-positive clone was identified by biochemical assay and immunohistochemical staining.

The axospinous contacts invariably formed part of a synaptic complex in which the dendritic spine of a pyramidal neuron was the target of both a DA-positive symmetric and an unlabeled asymmetric bouton. This arrangement allows direct DA modulation of the overall excitability of cortical projection neurons by altering local spine responses to excitatory inputs.\r"

We have analyzed the anatomical distribution of site-selective ligand binding for dopamine uptake sites in the striatum of rat, cat, and monkey. We report here that desipramine-sensitive [3H]mazindol binding sites have highly heterogeneous distributions in the dorsal and the ventral striatum. In the caudate nucleus of cat and monkey, [3H]mazindol binding observes striosomal ordering, being reduced in striosomes and heightened in the extrastriosomal matrix. Some local heterogeneity appears in the ventral caudoputamen of the rat. Different subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens also have different binding levels. These findings suggest that some functional effects of psychoactive drugs, such as cocaine, that bind to the dopamine-uptake complex could be related to the distribution of these specific uptake sites. The findings also raise the possibility that these distributions could result in selective neuronal vulnerability to neurotoxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+), that depend on the dopamine-uptake complex for entry into neurons.\r"

  ".W": "The central nervous system of individuals with multiple sclerosis contains lesions specifically characterized by breakdown of myelin sheaths associated with a general failure of repair of demyelinating damage. The cause of myelin breakdown is unknown. Although immune mechanisms have been implicated in this breakdown, no convincing demonstrations of specific immune reaction against myelin have yet been provided in multiple sclerosis patients. Similarly, the cellular biological mechanisms which underlie the failure of myelin repair are unknown. We have found that (i) oligodendrocytes, the cells that produce myelin sheaths in the central nervous system, and (ii) oligodendrocyte/type-2 astrocyte (O/2A) progenitor cells derived from optic nerves of adult rats bind and activate complement in the absence of antibody in vitro, leading to destruction of these cells. Susceptibility to antibody-independent lysis by complement was a cell-type-specific trait of oligodendrocytes and adult O/2A progenitors and was not shared by perinatal O/2A progenitors, type-2 astrocytes, type-1 astrocytes, meningeal cells, or Schwann cells. We suggest that the susceptibility of oligodendrocytes and adult O/2A progenitor cells to complement-induced lysis, combined with other specific properties of adult O/2A progenitors, are consistent with--and may be a contributing factor--both in the generation of demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis and also in the failure of these lesions to be successfully repaired in adult multiple sclerosis patients.\r"

  ".U": "90046925\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the release of two peptide cotransmitters from the terminals of a cholinergic motor neuron in Aplysia. Identified motor neuron B15 synthesizes the two small cardioactive peptides (SCP) A and B in addition to acetylcholine. A symmetrical pair of B15 neurons innervate symmetrical buccal muscles, termed I5, which are involved in generating biting movements. The amplitude of I5 contractions is enhanced by the SCPs. Intracellular stimulation of one B15 produces depletion of the SCPs from the stimulated muscle as compared to the unstimulated control muscle. Significant depletion requires either high-frequency stimulation or prolonged bursts at lower frequencies. A second cholinergic motor neuron, B16, also innervates I5 but does not synthesize the SCPs. Stimulation of B16 produced no depletion of the SCPs. Exogenous SCPs potently increase cAMP levels in the muscle. If depletion is a reflection of release, it should be possible to demonstrate an effect of B15 stimulation on muscle cAMP levels. Indeed, stimulation of B15 did elevate cAMP levels in I5. Stimulation of B16 had no effect on cAMP levels. Increases in cAMP were observed only when B15 was stimulated in a manner that would produce significantly facilitated acetylcholine release. This facilitation could be produced by increased stimulation frequency, longer burst durations, or shorter interburst intervals. However, B15 is capable of producing cholinergically mediated contractions with stimulation parameters that would not cause release of the SCPs. Thus, B15 appears to function as a purely cholinergic motor neuron when firing slowly, and as a cholinergic/peptidergic neuron when firing rapidly.\r"

The Q angles of 100 individuals (50 men, 50 women), who had no history of knee disorders, were measured goniometrically. The hip widths and femur lengths of all subjects were measured with calipers. The mean Q angle for women was 15.8 +/- 4.5 degrees and for men was 11.2 +/- 3.0 degrees. Using a point biserial correlation, we found a relationship between gender and Q angle (r = -.517) that remained significant (p less than .01) when the effects of femur length and hip width were controlled. The relationships identified between Q angle and the anatomical measurements were no longer significant when the effect of gender was eliminated. The results substantiate the belief that women have larger Q angles than men, but they fail to provide clinicians with an anatomical explanation or new predictor of Q angle.\r"

Integrated electromyographic data were recorded in relaxed and erect postures at L2 and L5 in 20 volunteers. Lumbar curvature was measured with a flexible ruler. Analyses of variance for repeated measures (p = .05) and paired t tests were used to compare the IEMG and LC measurements. During relaxed postures, there was more IEMG activity and greater LC in standing than in the OC or the SBC. During erect postures, there was more IEMG activity in standing than in the OC and no difference in LC between chairs. The IEMG activity at L5 was greatest on the left side across chairs. In typing and writing, significant differences in IEMG activity were found between sides, but not between chairs. The LC was greater in the BC than in the SBC in relaxed sitting, typing, and writing. The pattern of IEMG activity is not similar to corresponding LC measurements. Care and prevention of low back injury is a critical focus in physical therapy. The BC could contribute to treatment.

The electrophysiologic responses of the sural nerve were determined at different temperatures in 22 healthy adults. Distal sensory latency and amplitude of the sural SNAP was determined at 1 degree C intervals over a limb temperature range of 23 degrees to 40 degrees C. Limb temperature was monitored with a thermistor probe placed subcutaneously near the sural nerve. Ice bath soaks were used for cooling and infrared radiation for warming the limbs. An analysis of covariance was performed for the SNAP latencies and amplitudes to determine the effect of gender and leg (right or left) at each temperature level. No effect of gender or leg on neural conduction was detected in individual subjects. A regression analysis was then used on pooled data to determine the effect of temperature on sural SNAP latency and amplitude. An inverse linear change in the latency of sural SNAP was observed over the temperature ranges used. Mean latency increased 0.1 msec per 1 degree C increase in subcutaneous temperature. A direct relationship between amplitude of the SNAP and temperature was determined. Mean amplitude increased 0.3 muV per 1 degree C increase in subcutaneous temperature. The results of this study support previous reports, which state that SNAP latency is indirectly related to the intraneural temperature. Clinical electromyographers must monitor the temperature of the lower leg and foot whenever sensorineural conduction of the lower limbs is performed.\r"

  ".W": "In this article, we present a systematic approach to physical therapy management of individuals with Parkinson's disease. This approach is based on a model that relates knowledge of the underlying pathology of the disease to impairments and disability. We discuss use of the model to evaluate, interpret, and treat impairments and disabilities of the patient with Parkinson's disease. We emphasize the relative influence of impairments that arise directly from the neuroanatomical pathology and those that arise indirectly through subsequent musculoskeletal alterations. We illustrate the use of the model in setting goals and in developing a treatment program. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the application of this approach to specific patient care. These case studies suggest the efficacy of physical therapy initiated early in the disease process. The first case study illustrates improvements of balance, gait, and functional movement made by an individual who was not yet receiving medication for Parkinson's disease. The second case study illustrates improvements of balance, gait, and functional movement made by an individual who was already receiving medication for the disease. These case studies illustrate the dramatic improvements that can be achieved in the patient with Parkinson's disease.\r"

What differentiates diagnosis by the physical therapist from diagnosis by the physician is not the process itself but the phenomena being observed and classified. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps is one clinical taxonomy available to help physical therapists diagnose and classify clinical phenomena important to their scope of practice. Developing and applying classification systems to order its observations is a critical stage in the physical therapy profession's efforts to develop its scientific base.\r"

I strongly value the profession of physical therapy and the services we provide to this society. Most of all, I value our education programs and our academicians, without whose efforts none of us would be gathered here today. Early in this Address, I indicated my belief that our education programs have an awesome influence on this profession. But the goals proposed for the twenty-first century pose a challenge to all physical therapists. I make this challenge to academicians, clinical practitioners, educational institutions, and the APTA at all levels. It is imperative that we all join together to identify ways to support, strengthen, and improve our modes of professional education for the twenty-first century. We must do so in pursuit of the educational excellence that has been our consistent endeavor and hallmark for more than 68 years.\r"

Ear frameworks, including the helix, anthelix, concha, and tragus, were prepared using autologous rib cartilage. Based on the surface area of the normal adult auricle, the silicone expander was tentatively shaped and sized into a rotated semiellipse and expanded with 70 cc saline. Auricular reconstruction on the framework was completed at the time of insertion in four of the seven patients, requiring no elevation of the ear. The reconstructed auricle was satisfactory in both color and texture and had nearly normal sensation. Mild complications were noted in three of the seven patients. However, no resorption of the inserted rib cartilage has been observed 14 months to 2 years and 5 months after the operation. Slight shrinkage of the expanded skin was noted in each patient.\r"

Our observations, modifications of the standard surgical technique, and the results of orbital decompression for this condition are presented. Through a transverse incision close to the lower eyelid margin, the floor and the lateral orbital wall are explored. The posterior part of the orbital floor and the zygomatic part of the lateral orbital wall, as well as the periorbital fat, are removed. Through an incision made over the medial margin of the orbit, the medial orbital wall is explored and its ethmoidal part is removed. By the same approach, further retrobulbar fat is removed. Through an upper eyelid incision, fat is removed from the eyelid region and the levator aponeurosis is divided. This produces satisfactory symmetrical decompression of the orbit with good correction of exophthalmos and a significant decrease in the signs and symptoms of this condition.\r"

This report presents three patients with composite tissue defects of the face aesthetically reconstructed with a chondrocutaneous postauricular free flap. For its safe surgical application, additional anatomic knowledge was refined with cadaver study. Use of the chondrocutaneous postauricular free flap has some merits. Its dissection is straightforward and safer than when only the cutaneous unit is used. It also offers a more dependable vascularized composite tissue as a one-stage operation. With freedom of design, a variable combined facial defect can be delicately reconstructed. The final aesthetic results obtained were gratifying, and the donor-site deformity was minimal.\r"

To investigate the possibility of developing a more radiolucent implant, radiographs were obtained of silicone shells that contained silicone gel, saline, silicone gel and saline, polyurethane-covered silicone gel, gelatin, sunflower oil, and peanut oil. All radiographs were obtained using a Siemens Mammomat by placing the implant over an American College of Radiology mammography phantom. Results were measured by the ability to visualize or resolve the artifacts in the mammography phantom. The silicone shell alone minimally altered artifact resolution. Silicone shells filled with silicone gel, silicone gel and saline, saline alone, polyurethane-covered silicone gel, and gelatin were equal in radiodensity and completely obscured all phantom artifacts. Silicone shells filled with peanut oil and sunflower oil had equal radiodensity and allowed visualization of large microcalcifications and some soft-tissue masses. Current implants used for augmentation mammaplasty can totally obscure mammographic detection of microcalcifications and soft-tissue masses. A more radiolucent breast implant is possible, and further research is needed to define the best filler material and test its biocompatibility.\r"

It is also unknown whether onlay membranous bone grafts in immature animals have the ability to grow. To examine these questions, a model was developed in New Zealand white rabbits in which a segment of the zygomatic arch was transferred to the subjacent mandible as either a vascularized or nonvascularized transfer. At harvest 16 weeks later, residual graft volume and bone architecture were analyzed. Results demonstrate no improved survival for vascularized membranous grafts in adult animals (n = 7), while in the immature animals (n = 6), growth of the vascularized bone transfers was documented. We conclude that in the majority of instances in craniofacial reconstruction, nonvascularized onlay membranous grafts are to be preferred. Specific instances for the use of vascularized transfers will be discussed.\r"

To eliminate individual variation, the vasculature of each flap was evaluated by injecting dye prior to ligating either or both of the pedicle vessels. Seventy-five male Wistar rats divided into four groups were used. Six of the rats died, so 69 rats were evaluated. Statistically, the dye distance of each group was the same. In the control group of 29 rats, survival length was directly proportional to dye distance. Although the mean values of the survival length minus the dye distance of each flap (delta S.L.) in the venous inadequacy group were not different from those of the control group, there was significant difference between the mean values of the arterial insufficiency and the venous inadequacy plus arterial insufficiency groups and those of the control group. In the pedicle island flap, mild venous inadequacy was less responsible for necrosis when the arterial inflow was sufficient. However, when the arterial inflow was impaired, even mild venous inadequacy affected flap survival.\r"

DHV-PGE2ME and placebo were applied to bilateral island flaps on 70 anesthetized rats; then the vascular pedicle of each flap was clamped for 10 hours. Treated flaps evidenced significantly better reperfusion, as documented by quantification of fluorescein dye delivery at 90 minutes after clamp release, and they had significantly greater ultimate viability (p less than 0.05, by ANOVA). While less than 3 percent of untreated flaps survived, those treated with 1.75 and 17.5 microgram/cm2 of drug evidenced 76 and 86 percent survival, respectively. Treatment of a given flap did not affect its contralateral mate, since there was no evidence of a systemic effect. Especially since its effect can be limited to the site of application, DHV-PGE2ME should be valuable for the treatment of compromised perfusion in a variety of settings.\r"

Qualitative and, more important, quantitative information will be essential elements in the process. This information will need to be viewed in the light of the expectations of radiologists. These expectations may be referred to as guidelines, standards, or practice parameters. If radiologists wish to be active participants in the process rather than passive observers, they need to develop their own standards of practice. For the development of standards, the authors propose a unifying approach based on the concept of components of radiology service and the service as a whole. The concept provides a flexible framework for building a list of standards. This list may be shortened or expanded in response to available resources and changing practice patterns.\r"

  ".W": "The bowler-hat sign has been described both with colonic polyps and with diverticula. The authors describe a simple principle for evaluating a bowler-hat sign in order to determine whether it is caused by a polyp or a diverticulum. If the bowler hat points toward the center of the long axis of the bowel, it represents an intraluminal structure (ie, a polyp). If, however, it points away from the center of the long axis of the bowel, it represents an extraluminal structure (ie, a diverticulum). Only if the bowler hat is located in the midline or is directly parallel to the long axis of the bowel is it impossible to classify the abnormality as a polyp or a diverticulum. The value of this principle was confirmed with both a radiographic model and a blinded review of radiographs from 37 cases demonstrating the bowler-hat sign. When a bowler hat is present on a double-contrast barium enema examination, use of this principle provides a simple and objective means of differentiating a polyp from a diverticulum.\r"

CT results were classified into three groups. Category 1 included injuries limited to superficial subcutaneous tissue (n = 174); category 2, injuries to the retroperitoneal compartment (n = 18); and category 3, injuries within the peritoneal cavity (n = 13). Fifty patients underwent surgery, including 30 with category 1 injuries, nine with category 2 injuries, and eleven with category 3 injuries. CT categorization of injury, compared with surgical findings in these 50 patients, had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 93%. The CT interpretation was considered correct if it demonstrated peritoneal penetration or retroperitoneal injury potentially requiring surgery. The remaining 155 patients were managed nonoperatively, and none had late complications. Abdominal CT is a reliable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of penetrating injury to the back.\r"

Three of the twelve who improved underwent operations for attempts at surgical cure or debulking of tumor volume despite an initial \"good\" response to percutaneous drainage. Of the nine patients who did not undergo surgery after percutaneous drainage, four underwent catheter removal after 5 weeks of drainage and had no recurrence of infection, two remained alive with the catheter in place up to 8 months and 1 year after drainage, and two died with the catheter in place. One patient had the catheter removed inadvertently after 3 weeks of drainage and had recurrences that required replacement of the catheter until his death. The major differences between drainage of necrotic tumors and drainage of standard abscesses were the need for surgery in the majority of the cases and the fact that patients needed the catheters for continued palliation until their death.\r"

All patients were imaged with CT arterial portography (CTAP), delayed CT of the liver, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. All CTAP studies were evaluated for a \"straight line,\" a linear variation in contrast within the liver. Sixteen patients (36%) demonstrated the straight line sign. All 16 had a mass at the proximal portion of the defect. Nine of 16 had defects that clearly correlated with portal venous distribution seen at limited digital angiography. Fourteen of the 16 patients showed loss of the straight line sign at delayed CT and/or MR imaging of the liver. These defects are thought to be due to vascular obstruction. The straight line sign will probably be seen more frequently as CTAP is more commonly used. Recognition of the sign is important in the evaluation of primary liver carcinomas, since it signifies that the tumor may be inoperable. Also, if metastatic disease is present, it alerts the surgeon to the proximity of the portal vein to the neoplasm.\r"

In 18 patients with known hepatic tumors, hepatic artery perfusion scans were obtained with the concurrent infusion of technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin and escalating doses of epinephrine (0-10 micrograms/min). Regions of interest were drawn around tumor and adjacent normal liver in three planes, and the average tumor-to-liver ratio (T:L) was calculated. In all 18 patients, there was a measurable baseline T:L perfusion advantage (range, 1.7-18.7; mean, 4.8). In 12 of 18 patients, this ratio increased with epinephrine (range, 1.1-53.6 times the baseline value; mean, 7.1). In six patients, no improvement in T:L could be demonstrated. In 14 patients the lung shunt index, a measurement of arteriovenous shunting, increased with escalating doses of epinephrine. This pilot study suggests that the infusion of epinephrine may improve the therapeutic index of certain regional therapies such as bolus drug infusions, hepatic arterial embolization, and radioactive microsphere therapy.\r"

Eighty-two patients with isolated and syndromal synostoses were imaged with CT and three-dimensional CT, and 42 with skull radiography. Three-dimensional CT scan processing was performed by shaded-surface reconstruction, volumetric, and depth-coded methods. Two trained observers read each scan series in a blinded fashion. Diagnostic utility of the images was determined with receiver operating characteristic analysis. The observers ranked three-dimensional shaded images higher than the other types, with three-dimensional volumetric images second and three-dimensional surface images ranked third. Results of this study demonstrate that three-dimensional shaded-surface reconstruction from CT scans is superior to conventional plain radiographs and CT scans in diagnosing craniosynostosis.\r"

A significant frequency of VUR was demonstrated in boys studied for various other conditions. Excretory urography in 588 boys revealed congenital anomalies of the upper urinary tract in 72, with VUR in 26 (36.1%), which was significantly higher than that in boys with hypospadias (P greater than .01). There was no significant difference between the frequency of VUR in boys with hypospadias with or without meatal stenosis (P greater than .9) and in boys with meatal stenosis with or without hypospadias (P greater than .9); thus, VUR seems to be independent of mild urethral obstruction and hypospadias. VUR was more frequent in boys with posterior urethral valves (62.5%, P less than .002). VUR in boys with urinary tract infection is as common as in girls. In most cases, its frequency in many apparently unrelated conditions is suggestive of its primary nature.\r"

Of 73 nonpalpable carcinomas, fourteen (19%) had radiographic features of radial scar. Only the presence of microcalcifications in 11 of those patients helped the authors distinguish carcinoma from radial scars. Four of nine biopsy-proved radial scars had a dense central region, simulating the appearance of scirrhous carcinoma.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis for detection of simulated nodules and monitoring devices (nine readers, 4,608 observations) showed that digital radiography was superior to conventional radiography (P less than .05) for four of the nine readers and equivalent to conventional radiography for five readers. The authors concluded that digital radiography produces more consistent and ideal image density and performs at least as well as conventional radiography under phantom test conditions.\r"

Images were obtained with standard spin-echo sequences and electrocardiographic triggering before and after intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Thirty-seven of 48 lesions seen on MR images were nodular infiltrates; 34 of these had a targetlike appearance, with hypointense centers and iso- or hyperintense rims. Twenty-three of 37 nodular lesions contained areas of hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. All 37 had enhanced rims on postcontrast MR images. The remaining 11 lesions were segmental infiltrates, seven of which were predominantly hyperintense on T1-weighted images. In one patient with nodular lesions, MR imaging findings were correlated with those from pathologic analysis of a resected upper lobe. Areas of hyperintensity corresponded to subacute hemorrhage permeated by Aspergillus organisms. The authors believe that the typical targetlike appearance of nodular lesions on MR images and the potential that MR imaging has to reveal hemorrhagic content will prove useful in the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\r"

The normal anatomy of the triangular fibrocartilage and the intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments could be demonstrated effectively with MR imaging. MR imaging was effective in the evaluation of triangular fibrocartilage tears with a sensitivity of 1.0, a specificity of 0.93, and an accuracy of 0.95 when compared with arthrography; 0.89, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively, when compared with arthroscopy and arthrotomy. MR imaging could also be used effectively to evaluate tears of the intercarpal ligaments, particularly the scapholunate ligament. Disruptions of the extrinsic ligaments, articular cartilage defects, and subluxations of the distal radioulnar joint were also well demonstrated. MR imaging is an effective procedure in assessing patients with chronic wrist pain.\r"

In those patients with follow-up, each sequence demonstrated 100% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 94% accuracy for evaluation of the medial meniscus and 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 100% accuracy for evaluation of the lateral meniscus.

In the 37 patients without follow-up, only two discrepancies were found between the 2D SE and the 3D FISP images for meniscal evaluation. Three discrepancies were found in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament, two of which were likely false-positive 3D FISP results. We conclude that 2D SE and 3D FISP imaging provide comparable data for meniscal evaluation. FISP images are slightly less accurate than SE images of comparable resolution for the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament.\r"

A 9-minute 3D FASTER data acquisition achieves nearly isotropic voxels for the calculation of any desired image plane without a significant loss in image quality. Image contrast is optimized for visualization of knee anatomy in a single sequence. An image-processing workstation is used to speed the multiplanar image calculation and display for more efficient analysis of the complex 3D data set. The 3D FASTER images were superior or equal to 2D images (which took three times longer to acquire) in demonstrating meniscal tears, ligament tears, bone marrow disease, and osteochondral defects. The combined advantages of improved imaging capability and efficiency could make 3D FASTER imaging a routine MR method for knee imaging.\r"

Eight of the piglets underwent early occlusion of the vascular pedicle to one flap that resulted in flap failure in all cases. Six piglets underwent late occlusion of the vascular pedicle to one flap that resulted in flap survival in all cases. Spin-echo T1- and T2-weighted MR images were obtained from all piglets 2 and 24 hours after occlusion. Additional gadolinium diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-enhanced serial T1-weighted images were obtained in four piglets who underwent early occlusion and in four piglets who underwent late occlusion of the pedicle. The T2-weighted images showed increased signal intensity in both occluded and control flaps and thus did not help predict flap viability. Gd-DTPA-enhanced images enabled accurate prediction of flap viability. The images of early-occluded (non-viable) flaps demonstrated no contrast material enhancement, while both the late-occluded (viable) flaps and the control flaps were contrast enhanced. The authors conclude that Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging can help predict myocutaneous flap viability in piglets.\r"

T2-weighted MR images were acquired before and for 1 hour after intravenous administration of 1 mmol/kg of Dy-DTPA-BMA. Before administration of the contrast medium, signal intensity (SI) in the ischemic region was significantly greater than that in the normal myocardium; however, the borders of the ischemic region were not consistently distinct. The contrast medium caused marked decrease in SI of normal myocardium (18% +/- 3% of the control value), only slight decrease in the jeopardized region (76% +/- 6% of the control value), and no discernible effects on heart rate or blood pressure. Substantial contrast between normal and ischemic myocardium persisted for 1 hour. Moderate signal loss was observed in skeletal muscle. Dy-DTPA-BMA has the potential to demarcate the myocardial area in jeopardy as a region of high signal intensity because it erases signal preferentially in the normal myocardium.\r"

No perfusion defects or areas of redistribution were noted in any of the scans. Mean absolute myocardial T1-201 uptake was 1.3 times greater with AI than with EST. Mean absolute extracardiac uptake was 2.0 times greater with AI. Mean T1-201 myocardial clearance was virtually the same in all AI and EST views. During AI, 70% of the subjects experienced subjective side effects, mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 15%, and heart rate increased by 48%. The effects of adenosine on T1-201 kinetics in the myocardium are similar to those of EST. Adenosine may be useful as a pharmacologic stress agent in patients undergoing T1-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy.\r"

In 65% of the vessel pairs studied, a portion of the CFA overlapped the CFV in an anteroposterior plane. In addition, more than 25% of the artery overlapped the vein in 8% of the vessel pairs. This variation in anatomic relationship between the CFA and CFV is clinically significant, since a femoral vein puncture can be associated with simultaneous passage of the entry needle through the artery and thus formation of an arteriovenous fistula.\r"

Meticulous angiographic evaluation of the hepatic vascular anatomy, its variations, and hemodynamics is necessary for correct catheter placement to achieve total liver perfusion without significant extrahepatic perfusion. Satisfactory hepatic perfusion should be documented before drug infusion. Hepatic arterial radionuclide flow imaging with technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated serum albumin remains the most reliable means of assessing hepatic perfusion following catheter placement.

This clinical syndrome is caused by microembolization to small vessels from a proximal source.

All seven had prompt healing of the ischemic toes, and none required surgical revascularization or amputation. One patient developed a recurrent stenosis at the atherectomy site and had a second episode of digital ischemia, which was treated by means of atherectomy with a larger device. Histologic study of atherectomy specimens suggests that emboli arise from adherent fibrinoplatelet aggregates or thrombus and less often from cholesterol-rich atheromatous plaque. Although either percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or atherectomy can be used to treat the underlying stenosis, percutaneous atherectomy offers the advantage of nonsurgical removal of embologenic material and provides material for histologic study. Percutaneous atherectomy is an effective method of treating embologenic superficial femoral stenoses in patients with ipsilateral blue toe syndrome.\r"

The titanium GF has a longer leg length (49 mm vs 43 mm), a greater span (38.5 mm vs 28.0 mm), and a larger hook angle (41 degrees vs 23.5 degrees). In vitro tests demonstrated approximately sevenfold greater filter length shortening (a measure of filter splaying) for the titanium GF in response to a given applied load. These differences resulted in marked filter splaying and inferior vena cava (IVC) perforation in three patients in whom a titanium GF had been inserted. The aorta was penetrated by a filter leg in one patient, and abdominal or back pain was present in all three patients. In vitro tests involving thrombosis within a latex balloon revealed that the titanium GF, but not the stainless steel GF, remained splayed even in the face of clot retraction. Design modifications, possibly using shorter, thicker filter legs and using reduced hook angles, should be made in the titanium GF to decrease the risk of filter splaying and IVC perforation before widespread use of this device.\r"

In vivo, 10.63 +/- 6.64 intact glomeruli were retrieved, and a definitive histologic diagnosis was achieved in 86% of patients. The frequency of major complications with this needle was 3.5%, and of minor complications, 5.8%. No major complications occurred after biopsy was performed with 18-gauge needles of the same design. However, the retrieval rate of glomeruli with these smaller needles was insufficient. An 18-gauge needle with two cutting edges yielded tissue cores of 11.0 mm +/- 3.5 in length. In vitro, 6.6 +/- 2.3 glomeruli were retrieved; in vivo, 9.92 +/- 6.65. A definitive histologic diagnosis was achieved with this needle in 75% of patients, and rates of 7.1% for major complications and 10.7% for minor complications were encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Most tumors in the parotid gland are either benign neoplasms or low-grade malignancies. The magnetic resonance (MR) images of 29 patients with such tumors were reviewed. These masses typically have low T1-weighted and high T2-weighted signal intensities and have clearly defined margins. The signal characteristics presumably reflect the serous and mucinous products that are characteristic of these lesions. The MR images of six patients with aggressive parotid tumors were reviewed and correlated with operative and pathologic findings. These high-grade parotid lesions are uncommon, usually have poorly defined margins, and have low T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities. These signal characteristics presumably reflect the lack of serous and mucinous products, the high mitotic ratio, and the high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios that are characteristic of these lesions. The authors conclude that the findings of these tumors on MR images are characteristic and should be suggestive of their diagnosis. The preoperative diagnosis of these high-grade tumors allows a more radical surgical treatment to be well planned before surgery. The primary differential diagnoses of these aggressive tumors with MR imaging include fibrosis and sialolithiasis.\r"

Our study was undertaken to evaluate image quality and level of patient discomfort during examinations with water-soluble contrast agents (iohexol [Omnipaque 240], iopamidol [Isovue 200 and 300], and 52.7% diatrizoate meglumine and 26.9% iodipamide meglumine [Sinografin]) compared with the iodized oil-based contrast agent Lipiodol. Fifty-five dacryocystograms were obtained from 41 consecutive patients. The procedure was performed first with a water-soluble contrast agent, then repeated with Lipiodol. A distention technique was used with conventional radiography. Patients were asked to evaluate their level of discomfort (none, mild, moderate, severe). The images were evaluated separately by two radiologists, blinded to which water-soluble agent was employed, and the images were graded on a five-point scale. Images obtained with Lipiodol were significantly better than those with other agents (P less than .02), and image quality deteriorated as iodine concentration decreased. Use of Isovue 300 and Sinografin produced significantly more patient discomfort (P less than .03) than the use of other agents. The authors conclude that, in most instances, Lipiodol is the contrast agent of choice with regard to both highest level of patient comfort and greatest conventional radiographic image quality among the agents compared.\r"

Spin-echo images obtained with flow presaturation demonstrated the nidus of the AVM in all cases, but it was difficult to determine feeding vessels. These vessels were directly visualized with three-dimensional MR angiography; their presence could be indirectly determined by means of selective presaturation of individual vessels, which resulted in a marked decrease in signal within the portion of the AVM supplied by that vessel. Vascular supplies from the internal carotid artery and anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries were detected in all cases, but in three large malformations it was not possible to demonstrate small feeding vessels. MR angiograms were also helpful for further defining the nidus. The combination of MR angiographic and spin-echo methods provides information useful for therapeutic planning not provided by either technique alone.\r"

In addition to intramedullary expansion, areas of patchy, multifocal, parenchymal enhancement and areas of linear peripheral enhancement were seen in all three patients; these findings have not been previously reported and are unusual for other more common spinal cord lesions. This observation led to a correct diagnosis and a limitation of the extent of biopsy in two of the cases. Unfortunately, this enhancement pattern is not specific for sarcoidosis, as the authors have observed similar findings in two cases of biopsy-proved myelitis and multiple sclerosis. The peripheral enhancement is thought to be located in the leptomeninges due to leptomeningeal involvement, which was proved histologically in one case. This pattern of involvement, while not specific, is certainly consistent with and, in the appropriate clinical setting, highly suggestive of sarcoidosis.\r"

In 19 of 20 visualized cases (95%), the carcinoma was seen as an area of low signal intensity within the peripheral zone on T2-weighted images. However, in one case the signal intensity of the carcinoma was higher than that of the remainder of the peripheral zone. All carcinomas were located within the peripheral zone. The accuracy of MR imaging in the prediction of extraglandular tumor spread was 82%, with a sensitivity of 37.5% and a specificity of 100%. Nineteen patients (67%) exhibited histologically benign hyperplasia, which could be identified on MR images in 10 cases (53%). The signal intensities of the nodules varied. All areas of benign hyperplasia were located within the central zone. The location of the pathologic changes must therefore be considered in differential diagnosis.\r"

In a surgical technique termed ovarian transposition, the ovary is repositioned to the iliac fossa or paracolic gutter outside the radiation field. The computed tomographic (CT) scans and sonograms of five patients with cervical carcinoma who underwent this procedure were reviewed. The normal transposed ovary was of soft-tissue attenuation, often with one or more small cysts. Large cysts developed in the ovaries of three patients. One cyst was functional, another was due to a mesothelial inclusion cyst, and the third was most probably related to the transposition itself. Since the transposed ovary is difficult to palpate, CT or sonography can be used to demonstrate and follow up a cystic mass. Recognition of the appearance and location of the transposed ovary is important to avoid misinterpretation of a solid or cystic mass in patients who are at risk for tumor recurrence.\r"

The median interval from the bite to the appearance of EM was 9 days (range, 1-36 days). Forty-one (17%) of the patients had multiple EM lesions. Of the 237 patients, 128 (54%) manifested major extracutaneous signs and symptoms. Although EM also has a variable histologic picture, the presence of a deep and superficial perivascular and interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrate containing plasma cells is diagnostic. Spirochetes can be demonstrated with Warthin-Starry staining in approximately 40% of the biopsy specimens. Concomitant cutaneous lesions appeared on some patients before and during antibiotic therapy. Nine patients with serologic evidence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection had cutaneous lesions other than EM, including granuloma annulare (three), erythema nodosum (two), papular urticaria (two), Henoch-Schonlein-like purpura (one), and morphea (one). Whether these entities are cutaneous markers of Lyme disease or are coincidental findings is yet to be determined.\r"

In some patients, the full extent of the infection consists of a stage I acute systemic viral-like illness. Stage II primarily involves the cardiovascular system (myocarditis) and/or the central nervous system (CNS) (meningoencephalitis, polyradiculitis). More inflammatory cells are found in the heart and nervous system structures during this intermediate stage than are found in any tissues involved during stage I. Stage III is characterized by peripheral neuropathy and CNS disorders such as dementia or transverse myelitis and arthritis and synovitis of large joints such as the knee. Chronic Lyme disease is also associated with multiple and seemingly unrelated cutaneous manifestations such as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, sclerodermoid-like reactions, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, subcuticular fibrous nodules, eosinophilic fasciitis-like lesions of the extremities, and, possibly, granuloma annulare. With care, spirochetes can be recovered or demonstrated by silver staining in most of the above lesions. Spirochetes have yet to be seen in the tissues of autonomic ganglia or peripheral nerves.\r"

However, this relation is true only for pure-tone signals (spectral pitch); it can be quite different in the case of complex auditory stimuli (virtual pitch), thus requiring a multistage process for pitch formation. Neuromagnetic measurements showed that the tonotopic organization of the primary auditory cortex reflects the pitch rather than the frequency of the stimulus; that is, the pitch formation process must take place in subcortical regions.\r"

Loss of either of these two metabolic requirements was used as a selectable marker for the repopulation of rho 0 cells with exogenous mitochondria by complementation. Transformants obtained with various mitochondrial donors exhibited a respiratory phenotype that was in most cases distinct from that of the rho 0 parent or the donor, indicating that the genotypes of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes as well as their specific interactions play a role in the respiratory competence of a cell.\r"

It is now shown that a mutation that prevents the normal amino-terminal myristoylation of a prominent cellular substrate of protein kinase C, and appears to prevent its membrane association, does not prevent the normal phosphorylation of this protein in intact cells in response to phorbol esters. Thus, membrane association may not be required in order for protein kinase C substrates to undergo phosphorylation.\r"

The recombinant fragment of the myosin heavy chain was purified 2400-fold from one of the resulting cell lines and was found to be functional by the following criteria: the myosin head fragment copurified with the essential and regulatory myosin light chains, decorated actin filaments, and displayed actin-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity. In addition, motility assays in vitro showed that the recombinant myosin fragment is capable of supporting sliding movement of actin filaments.\r"

The mRNAs of certain regulatory cellular proteins such as oncogenes, cytokines, lymphokines, and transcriptional activators are extremely labile. These messages share a common AUUUA pentamer in their 3' untranslated region, which confers cytoplasmic instability. A cytosolic protein was identified that binds specifically to RNA molecules containing four reiterations of the AUUUA structural element. This protein consists of three subunits and binds rapidly to AUUUA-containing RNA. Such protein-RNA complexes are resistant to the actions of denaturing and reducing agents, demonstrating very stable binding. The time course, stability, and specificity of the protein-AUUUA interaction suggests the possibility that the formation of this complex may target susceptible mRNA for rapid cytoplasmic degradation.\r"

It has, however, not been possible to identify the genes or their products. An MHC class I (Dd) transgene introduced in C57BL donors prevented the rejection of their bone marrow by NK cells in irradiated allogeneic and F1 hybrid mice expressing the Dd gene. Conversely, H-2Dd transgenic C57BL recipients acquired the ability to reject bone marrow from C57BL donors but not from H-2Dd transgenic C57BL donors. These results provide formal evidence that NK cells are part of a system capable of rejecting cells because they lack normal genes of the host type, in contrast to T cells, which recognize cells that contain abnormal or novel sequences of non-host type.\r"

This ligation mediated, single-sided PCR technique permits the exponential amplification of an entire sequence ladder. Several footprints were detected in terminally differentiated muscle cells where the MCK gene is actively transcribed. None were observed in myogenic cells prior to differentiation or in nonmuscle cells. Two footprints appear to correspond to sites that can bind the myogenic regulator MyoD1 in vitro, whereas two others represent muscle specific use of apparently general factors. Because MyoD1 is synthesized by undifferentiated myoblasts, these data imply that additional regulatory mechanisms must restrict the interaction between this protein and its target site prior to differentiation.\r"

The full-length complementary DNA sequence predicts a protein with an unusually simple structure, including four tandem EGF-like repeats and a hydrophobic leader, but lacking a potential transmembrane domain. Sequence similarities suggest that the peptides are homologous to two peptides from a different sea urchin species, which cause a classic developmental defect, exogastrulation, when added to the seawater outside of embryos. The SpEGF2 messenger RNA begins to accumulate at blastula stage, and in pluteus larvae it is distributed in discrete regions of ectoderm that are not congruent with known histological borders. One region corresponds to that expressing the homeodomain-containing protein, SpHbox1. The structure of the SpEGF2 protein and the pattern of accumulation of its messenger RNA suggest that it may have important functions as a secreted factor during development of sea urchin embryos.\r"

A newly developed genomic sequencing procedure in which a ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used generates high quality, reproducible sequence ladders starting with only 1 microgram of uncloned mammalian DNA per reaction. Different sequence ladders can be created simultaneously by inclusion of multiple primers and visualized separately by rehybridization. Relatively little radioactivity is needed for hybridization and exposure times are short. Methylation patterns in genomic DNA are readily detectable; for example, 17 CpG dinucleotides in the 5' region of human X-linked PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) were found to be methylated on an inactive human X chromosome, but unmethylated on an active X chromosome.\r"

Complementary human DNA was prepared from a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid that contained less than 1% human DNA, by using consensus 5' intron splice sequences as primers. These primers would select immature, unspliced messenger RNA (still retaining species-specific repeat sequences) as templates. Screening a derived complementary DNA library for human repeat sequences resulted in the isolation of human clones at the anticipated frequency with characteristics expected of exons of transcribed human genes--single copy sequences that hybridized to discrete bands on Northern (RNA) blots.\r"

Inactivation is rapid (10(3) per second per molar concentration) and reactivation very slow (2.2 X 10(-6) per second). Apparently concerted with the inactivation, one equivalent (with respect to the enzyme) of m-hydroxybenzoate is released. Reactivation is accelerated by hydroxylamine and benzohydroxamate. This suggests that the loss of enzyme activity is due to phosphonylation of an active site functional group. This discovery holds the promise of a new general class of beta-lactamase inhibitors and, perhaps, antibiotics.\r"

Bilayers do not need to \"overcome\" some repulsive force barrier, such as hydration, before they can fuse. Instead, once bilayer surfaces come within about 1 nanometer of each other, local deformations and molecular rearrangements allow them to \"bypass\" these forces.\r"

Although the native composition is alpha beta, a mixture of equal amounts of alpha alpha and beta beta is produced by refolding dissociated alpha and beta at low temperature in vitro. Refolding kinetics showed that alpha alpha formed first and was relatively stable with regard to chain exchange below approximately 20 degrees C. Equilibration of the homodimer mixture at 30 degrees and 34 degrees C for long times, however, resulted in the formation of the native alpha beta molecule by chain exchange.  Biosynthesis of alpha beta from separate alpha and beta genes is, therefore, favored thermodynamically over the formation of homodimers, and biological factors need not be invoked to explain the preferred native alpha beta composition.\r"

Changing Glu113 to Gln causes a dramatic shift in the absorption maximum from 500 nanometers to 380 nanometers, a decrease in the pKa (acidity constant) of the protonated Schiff base of the chromophore to about 6, and a greatly increased reactivity with hydroxylamine. Thus Glu113 appears to be the counterion to the protonated Schiff base. Wavelength modulation in visual pigments apparently is not governed by electrostatic interaction with carboxylate residues, other than the counterion.\r"
