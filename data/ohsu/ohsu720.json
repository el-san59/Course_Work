Normal epidermis does not react with the antibody, but the inflamed epidermis may react. In this immunocytochemical study we have investigated the intracytoplasmic expression of the MAC 387 antigen in biopsies of a variety of skin disorders. In lichen planus the basal cells were usually negative, whilst suprabasal cells were positive. In the majority of other inflammatory dermatoses studied, there was positive staining of basal and suprabasal cells. A parallel frozen- and paraffin-section study of biopsies of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and inflammatory conditions failed to demonstrate HLA Class II expression in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes. Expression of the MAC 387 antigen in the epidermis is directly associated with cell-mediated activity in the papillary dermis, but is not related to HLA Class II expression.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that sebum permits the growth of Pityrosporum ovale, and hence the development of seborrhoeic dermatitis, was tested by observing whether a reduction of sebum production by isotretinoin would improve the disorder. In 10 male patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis, treatment with isotretinoin for 6 weeks reduced the mean sebum excretion rate by 70% and improved the severity of the rash, but with a site difference in magnitude of response. It is concluded that the residual pool of sebum is important for the growth of P. ovale and that, within the physiological range, sebum has a permissive effect on the growth of this yeast. Variation in the pools of residual sebum explains a number of features of the disease such as site of involvement and greater prevalence in males than females. The pathological increase in the residual pool of sebum due to immobility explains the frequent occurrence of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with a variety of neurological disorders.\r"

The coefficient of variation was 4% and the correlation coefficient 0.959, yet the limits of agreement were very wide. Applying these limits to centile charts of symphysis-fundal height shows that the fundal height cannot be measured by different observers with sufficient agreement to separate small fundal heights from those which are not small, and this severely limits the usefulness of measurement of the symphysis-fundal height as a screening test for intrauterine growth retardation. We conclude that inter-observer variation should be assessed by the method of limits of agreement, and not by calculating the coefficient of variation or the correlation coefficient.\r"

The analyses indicated that vomiting was associated with decreased risk of miscarriage (adjusted odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.53); women with nausea but no vomiting had a miscarriage risk equal to that in the sample overall. Among the subsample of women with signs of threatened miscarriage, those who had experienced vomiting had a decreased risk of miscarriage (10.3% vs 31.7% in the subsample). No statistically significant association was observed between nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and other pregnancy outcomes (perinatal mortality, fetal anomalies, neonatal anthropometric measures).\r"

A statistical meta-analysis confirmed the decreased risk of miscarriage associated with gestational nausea and vomiting (common odds ratio = 0.36, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.42) and indicated that the association with decreased fetal mortality was restricted to the first 20 weeks gestation.

Sixty women were randomized 2:1 for domiciliary surveillance or for conventional hospital care, with 40 and 17 records finally available for analysis. The groups were well matched for maternal, obstetric and socio-economic characteristics. In the domiciliary group, 21 (53%) of the women avoided hospital admission altogether, the admission rate was more than halved, and the mean proportion of the time spent in hospital was reduced from 50% to 16% of the observation period. The women who received domiciliary care were generally satisfied with the scheme. Our study confirms expectations that carefully planned domiciliary surveillance can reduce the number and duration of hospital admissions.\r"

We have determined the serum LH range during ovarian stimulation for IVF with a single regimen of clomiphene citrate/hMG from 102 consecutive IVF conception cycles. The results show a non-Gaussian distribution of LH values. Application of this LH range to a consecutive series of 596 women undergoing IVF treated with this single regimen showed no difference in pregnancy rates, fertilization rates, median number of oocytes fertilized or retrieved when analysed with respect to serum LH concentrations above the 75th or 95th centile for greater than or equal to 3 days of an IVF treatment cycle. We conclude that follicular-phase LH concentrations do not predict IVF fertilization rates or clinical outcome and are not clinically useful in individual patient management.\r"

Pruritis was the commonest symptom at presentation (59%). Of the 46 patients 44 were treated by laser skinning vulvectomy, local excision or simple vulvectomy. Symptomatic relief was best achieved by local excision. Clinical and definitive relapse occurred more often in the laser-treated group. The median time to relapse was 38 months in the laser-treated group and 74 months in the surgically treated group (excision and simple vulvectomy). Two patients have not been treated and their disease has not progressed. The carbon dioxide laser almost certainly has a role in conservative management and although our data possibly do not reflect its full potential they demonstrate a need for a controlled prospective study.\r"

Corneal decompensation leading to bullous keratopathy was the most frequent reason for failure, followed by glaucoma and intraocular inflammation. Of 18 cases in which inflammation was the principal clinical cause of failure 12 presented as infectious endophthalmitis, but minor degrees of sterile uveitis were fairly common. Retinal detachment was seen in seven cases. The interval between IOL implantation and the onset of serious complications varied from one month to 29 years, indicating that the presence of prosthesis will always entail a latent risk of an adverse tissue response, albeit slight.\r"

As well as measuring the demand incidence of cataract in Leicester's two main racial groups the data are used to investigate other risk factors. For both communities the demand incidence of cataract is significantly higher in women than in men, and it is significantly higher in people of Indian descent who emigrated directly from India than in those who emigrated from East Africa. Religious subgroups within the immigrant community also show small differences in their demand incidence. The possibility that these differences are linked to diet is considered.\r"

Patients were studied in whom PSC had followed probable exposure to low levels of radiation or in whom PSC had developed before the age of 60 without known exposure. The patients with cataract were compared with age and sex matched controls without cataract. Radiation sensitivity was estimated by measuring clonal growth of skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes after exposure to graded doses of radiation and by measuring postirradiation reconstruction of separated nuclear material from lymphocytes. The results show variations in the level of radiation sensitivity between the patients, without significant differences from the controls. It is concluded that radiation hypersensitivity, as tested by the methods used in this study, is not normally associated with the development of posterior subcapsular cataract.\r"

In a subgroup of 10 patients the treatment was continued for one week. In this group the final pretreatment IOP was 25.9 (SEM 1.3) mm Hg. The reduction 24 hours later was 4.5 (SEM 0.6) mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The effect was maintained and even slightly increased during the week, and on the seventh day of treatment the IOP reduction ranged between 4.8 and 7.6 mm Hg compared with the pretreatment IOP.

GMP-140, an integral membrane glycoprotein found in secretory granules of platelets and endothelium, is rapidly translocated to the cell surface after cellular activation. It shares sequence similarity with two leukocyte adhesion molecules, ELAM-1 and a lymphocyte homing receptor. We have recently shown that neutrophils bind to purified GMP-140 in a Ca2(+)-dependent fashion, and that GMP-140 participates in adhesion of neutrophils to activated endothelium. In this study we demonstrate that GMP-140 also mediates adhesion of neutrophils to stimulated platelets. Fixed thrombin-activated human platelets, but not unstimulated platelets, formed rosettes around neutrophils in the presence of Ca2+. The binding of platelets to neutrophils was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to GMP-140 and by purified GMP-140. By promoting close cell-cell contact, GMP-140 may recruit both platelets and neutrophils to sites of tissue injury as well as modulate the function of each cell type by the other.\r"

Four groups were investigated in detail: recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts with GVHD, recipients of T-cell depleted allografts, and recipients of genetically identical twin transplants. Decreased relapse was observed in recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts with acute (relative risk 0.68, P = .03), chronic (relative risk 0.43, P = .01), and both acute and chronic GVDH (relative risk 0.33, P = .0001) as compared with recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts without GVHD. These data support an antileukemia effect of GVHD. AML patients who received identical twin transplants had an increased probability of relapse (relative risk 2.58, P = .008) compared with allograft recipients without GVHD. These data support an antileukemia effect of allogeneic grafts independent of GVHD. CML patients who received T-cell depleted transplants with or without GVHD had higher probabilities of relapse (relative risks 4.45 and 6.91, respectively, P = .0001) than recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts without GVHD. These data support an antileukemia effect independent of GVHD that is altered by T-cell depletion. These results explain the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in eradicating leukemia, provide evidence for a role of the immune system in controlling human cancers, and suggest future directions to improve leukemia therapy.\r"

During the early stages of this induction, steady-state levels of cellular IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH), messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein are increased, perhaps because of cellular compensation for the inhibition of IMPDH activity. The subsequent decrease in IMPH mRNA and protein levels after several days of treatment suggests a change in the control of IMPDH expression. In contrast to the pattern of increased IMPDH expression observed in the mycophenolic acid-treated cells, treatment of HL-60 cells with two other inducers of differentiation, namely retinoic acid and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, resulted in stable or decreased levels of cellular IMPDH mRNA and protein. However, the kinetics of this expression were different. These results suggest that a number of factors influence the regulation of IMPDH expression during the induction of HL-60 cell differentiation, including the nature of the inducer. A decrease in the cellular IMPDH activity was observed for all of the inducers, suggesting that this decreased activity may be a determining factor in the acquisition of a mature phenotype in the HL-60 cells.\r"

It is generally assumed that polycythemia results from the secretion of erythropoietin (Epo) by the malignant cells. However, there is no direct proof supporting this hypothesis. Three patients with typical renal adenocarcinoma and polycythemia were studied. All three exhibited high Epo serum levels as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). A strong Epo signal was observed on Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from the renal tumors. The Epo message seemed to be of normal size and no Epo gene rearrangement was observed with the restriction enzymes tested. Using the in situ hybridization technique, a significant labeling was constantly observed on the tumor cells. Immunohistochemical studies showed that these tumor cells, known to be of tubular origin, were labeled by an anti-cytokeratin antibody and therefore were of epithelial nature. Thus, this study demonstrated that malignant cells of tubular origin were able to produce Epo constitutively, whereas in the mouse hypoxic kidney, peritubular cells (probably capillary endothelial cells) were the major site of Epo synthesis.\r"

The thromboxane-dependent aggregation of blood platelets is blocked by R68070, whereas no inhibition of thromboxane independent pathways occurs. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over study was performed on nine volunteers, comparing 400 mg placebo, 400 mg aspirin, and 400 mg R68070. Thromboxane-dependent aggregations were significantly inhibited by R68070 and by aspirin, the latter still having the most pronounced action. However, R68070 was clearly more powerful than aspirin (P less than .0005) in prolonging the bleeding time. Serum TxB2 formation was completely inhibited with both treatments, whereas serum 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 and intralesional 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were inhibited after aspirin and stimulated after R68070. We conclude that R68070 inhibits platelet thromboxane synthase and its thromboxane receptor both in vitro and in vivo; local reorientation of cyclic endoperoxide metabolism toward prostacyclin induces a stronger inhibition of hemostasis than that produced by aspirin.\r"

  ".W": "Southern blotting was performed with cDNA probes for the human von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene on six patients with severe type III von Willebrand's disease (vWD). A partial deletion in the 3' end of the vWF gene was demonstrated in one individual whose parents were related and who had an alloantibody inhibitor to vWF. A resulting novel 2.0-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment was used for carrier detection within the patient's family, and seven carriers of this recessive trait were identified. Of the six tested, five had normal or only slightly reduced levels of vWF antigen, but with generally higher levels of factor VIII. The sixth carrier had moderately severe vWD and it is proposed that this patient is heterozygous for the defective vWF gene and a second recessive vWF defect. The novel 2.0-kb EcoRI restriction fragment was cloned and sequenced, and compared with that of the corresponding normal 4.2-kb EcoRI fragment that includes exons 41 and 42 of the vWF gene. A deletion of 2,320 base pairs (bp) which included exon 42, was identified and a novel 182-bp insert was found between the breakpoints. This insert was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification both in the patient's DNA and in his carrier relatives.\r"

Because this gene alteration is not present in his parents or in 50 normal and 25 affected subjects, and the restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes are inherited normally in the patient's family, we suggest that a de novo mutation is present. Bands with reduced intensity and additional fragments, observed in several restriction digests, hybridize with noncontiguous copy DNA (cDNA) portions, thus indicating the presence of a heterozygous gene deletion. The deletion removes a genomic region containing at least codons 1147 through 1854 and corresponding to the D3-A3 homologous protein domains. The extent of the vWF pseudogene on chromosome 22 is roughly similar to that of the deleted area. However, the pseudogenic nature of the deletion is excluded by the mapping of bands with reduced intensity in the patient to the true vWF gene. The vWF antigen levels are one fourth of normal and ristocetin cofactor activity is severely impaired. The reduction of high molecular weight multimers in plasma and platelets and the altered triplet morphology are compatible with the presence of a dominant variant of type II von Willebrand disease.\r"

When radiolabeled Naka-negative platelets were used as a source of target antigens, no radiolabeled proteins were precipitated. The analyses using nonreduced-reduced two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and using rabbit antiglycoprotein (GP)IV demonstrated that this protein corresponds to GPIV (alternatively GPIIIb). Furthermore, in dot immunobinding, anti-Naka antibody bound to purified GPIV. Our results provide definitive evidence that the Naka alloantigen is carried on GPIV. These results also demonstrate that, on occasion, antibodies against GPIV may play an important role in refractoriness to platelet transfusions.\r"

  ".W": "The protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used to upregulate viral replication in a clone of promonocytic cells chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. Induction of virus could be inhibited by the triphenylethylene anti-estrogen tamoxifen at concentrations that had minimal effects on cellular DNA synthetic responses and cell cycle kinetics. This effect correlated with tamoxifen's ability to block PMA-mediated enhancement of HIV-promoter-driven transactivation in cells of monocyte and CD4+ T-lymphocyte lineages. No interference with a primary infection was noted. Tamoxifen's mechanism of action may relate both to its capacity to inhibit PKC and to consensus sequences for gonadal steroid responsive elements in the HIV long terminal repeat, as it was able to partially inhibit another HIV activator, 5-azacytidine, which does not modulate PKC function. The finding that regulation of HIV in a model for low-level chronic or latent infection is amenable to a nonimmunosuppressive steroid antagonist may suggest approaches to pharmacologic intervention early in HIV infection.\r"

The granular lymphocytes studied were characterized by morphologic, immunophenotypic, and immunogenotypic analyses. Cytolytic functions of the lymphocytes assayed included nonmajor histocompatibility complex-requiring cytotoxicity, anti-CD3-redirected cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The results showed that in lymphocytes with strong cytolytic functions high levels of perforin mRNA existed, whereas in lymphocytes with weak or undetectable levels of cytolytic functions, low levels of perforin mRNA existed. Because the levels of perforin mRNA correlated with those of cytolytic functions, perforin is probably a mediator in cytolytic functions of granular lymphocytes in patients with GLPDs. When the lymphocytes were cultured for 1 day, however, the levels of cytolytic activity were increased, and those of perforin mRNA were decreased. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that factors other than perforin protein are involved in the cytolytic functions of granular lymphocytes.\r"

The K422 cell line has a unique karyotype; this is the first occasion that the t(4;11) translocation has been described in a t(14;18) lymphoma.

  ".U": "90123191\r", 
  ".W": "Regulatory effects of glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) on myeloma cells as well as bone resorption in multiple myeloma were investigated. Glucocorticoids significantly inhibited proliferation of myeloma cells, and decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and secretory type immunoglobulin G (IgG). The inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on myeloma cell proliferation could be due to the decreased expression of IL-6 mRNA, decreased IL-6 production, and thus suppression of autocrine growth by IL-6, which is an autocrine growth factor for myeloma cells as reported previously (Nature 332:83, 1988). Glucocorticoids also inhibited M-protein secretion by decreasing the levels of secretory type Ig mRNA. On the other hand, because IL-1 beta rather than lymphotoxin is considered to be a major osteoclast activating factor (OAF) produced by myeloma cells, and glucocorticoids decreased the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA and markedly suppressed the bone resorbing activity induced by IL-1 beta OAF in 45Ca-release bone resorption assay, it is suggestive that glucocorticoids could inhibit bone resorption induced by IL-1 beta OAF in multiple myeloma. Therefore, from these data it is concluded that glucocorticoids could be more effective chemotherapeutic agents in multiple myeloma than we expected, especially with regards to the inhibitory effects on proliferation and M-protein secretion from myeloma cells, as well as bone resorption by myeloma cells.\r"

Anti-neutrophil antibodies were found in the sera of 36 of these patients by either 125I-staph A binding or immunofluorescence cytometric techniques that detected increased binding of patients' IgG to normal neutrophils. Anti-neutrophil antibody positive sera were then evaluated for specific binding to electrophoretically separated neutrophil membrane-associated proteins by immunoblotting. A 43-Kd protein was consistently identified by eight anti-neutrophil antibody positive sera. The specificity of binding to this protein was confirmed with affinity purified IgG and F(ab')2 fragments prepared from these sera. Sera from 20 healthy normal controls and from 22 non-neutropenic, anti-neutrophil antibody negative rheumatoid arthritis patients failed to bind this protein. Separate studies identified the 43-Kd protein as actin. Purified Acanthamoeba actin comigrated with the protein and was specifically bound by anti-neutrophil antibody positive IgG. Moreover, two actin-specific monoclonal antibodies bound to the 43-Kd membrane-associated protein in immunoblots. In addition, a rabbit anti-actin antiserum not only bound to this same 43-Kd protein but also expressed anti-neutrophil antibody activity against normal human neutrophils, as did purified human anti-actin IgG prepared by affinity chromatography from the serum of one of the index patients. These studies indicate that the anti-neutrophil antibodies of certain patients with autoimmune neutropenia include autoantibodies specific for actin. The molecules on the surface of neutrophils, which have actin-like antigenic epitopes and are recognized by these anti-actin antibodies, remain to be characterized.\r"

Alloimmunization to the antigen NB1 is a clinically important cause of neonatal neutropenia and febrile transfusion reactions. To study the immunochemistry of the NB1 antigen, we prepared neutrophil plasma membranes and granules by nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation and then analyzed them by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting with alloantibodies to several neutrophil-specific antigens. Two different antisera to the neutrophil-specific antigen NB1 identified an approximately 55-Kd protein by immunoblotting on neutrophil membranes from four NB1-positive donors but not on neutrophil membranes from five NB1-negative donors. Four anti-NB1 antisera immunoprecipitated a 58- to 64-Kd protein from extracts of NB1-positive neutrophils surface-labeled with 125I using lactoperoxidase, but not from similarly treated NB1-negative neutrophils. Normal human serum did not immunoprecipitate or immunoblot any proteins from these same neutrophil preparations. The NB1 antigen was detected by immunoblotting in secondary granules but was not found in primary granules. The electrophoretic mobility of the antigen was decreased slightly by reduction, suggesting that intrachain disulfide bonds were present. After reduction, the antigen could no longer be recognized by anti-NB1 antisera, but treatment of the antigen with periodate had no effect on the ability of anti-NB1 antisera to recognize the antigen, suggesting that it is not a carbohydrate. The data suggest that the neutrophil-specific antigen NB1 is present on a 58- to 64-Kd surface glycoprotein that is also present in secondary granules, and that the NB1 epitope is not a carbohydrate but probably resides in the tertiary structure of the protein backbone.\r"

To prove that this single point mutation results in increased promoter strength, we transfected erythroid and nonerythroid cell lines with constructs containing normal and mutant promoters linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. Differences in transfection efficiency were controlled by cotransfection of pRSVgpt. In K562 erythroleukemia cells, the -175 HPFH promoter directed three- to fourfold more CAT activity than its wild type counterpart. However, in HeLa cells the two promoters were similar in strength. The -195 to -165 region of the gamma-globin promoter contains binding sites for two proteins: a ubiquitously distributed octamer binding protein, OBP, and the erythroid-specific protein, GF-1. We find that while the GF-1 binding site is highly conserved among related primate gamma-globin genes, the octamer binding site is not. The evolutionary conservation of GF-1 as well as its erythroid-specific distribution suggest that this protein is important in gamma-globin gene expression. A role for OBP in the regulation of gamma-globin, if any, must have arisen recently in primate evolution.\r"

  ".W": "Erythrocytes from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are deficient in decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a factor called C8-binding protein or homologous restriction factor, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3). These proteins share a common feature that glycan-inositolphospholipid anchors the protein to the membrane, suggesting that an abnormality related to this glycolipid causes multiple protein deficiencies. The relationship between the DAF, AchE, and LFA-3 defects was studied by fluorescent flow cytometric analysis. In five patients, DAF-negative erythrocytes were also AchE-negative. In three patients, a fraction of DAF-negative erythrocytes expressed subnormal levels of AchE, indicating that AchE was synthesized in these DAF-negative cells. Erythrocytes from the patients having DAF-negative, AchE-positive cells were separated according to density and analyzed for expression of DAF and AchE. Both proteins decreased with increase of cell density, suggesting that DAF-negative, AchE-positive cells become AchE-negative during erythrocyte maturation by losing AchE. A low level of LFA-3 was found on DAF-negative erythrocytes from one patient and decreased with erythrocyte maturation. These results support an idea that complete deficiency of glycan-inositolphospholipid-anchored proteins on erythrocytes could result from abnormally early termination of surface recruitment of these proteins, and subsequent dilution through cell divisions and loss from the surface.\r"

The first isozyme (HKI) eluted as a sharp peak at the same position as HKI of human liver. The second isozyme eluted between HKI and HKII of human white blood cells, and it appeared to be unique to the RBC (it was designated HKR). From a gel filtration column, HKR eluted before HKI, suggesting that it was larger than HKI by several kilodaltons. In a mitochondria-enriched fraction from human reticulocytes, no HKR was found; thus, HKR was not a mitochondrial enzyme. Despite these differences in chromatographic behavior, size, and mitochondrial binding, both forms behaved kinetically as HKI. RBC from normal blood contained HKI and HKR at an equal activity, but in reticulocyte-rich RBC, HKR dominated. When RBC of increasing age was separated by buoyant density ultracentrifugation, the total HK activity decayed in a biphasic manner, with half-lives respectively of approximately 15 and approximately 51 days. When isolated by MonoQ column from each age-separated fraction, HKR was the major form in the youngest RBC, and decreased rapidly with cell age, with a t 1/2 of approximately 10 days, representing a negligible activity in the oldest RBC. Instead, HKI was relatively stable through the entire life span of the RBC, with a t 1/2 of approximately 66 days. Thus, HKR appears to be an RBC-specific isozyme that is predominant in the reticulocyte and is then rapidly degraded. During maturation of the RBC, the fast decay of HKR contributes to the early sharp decline of HK activity and the slow decay of HKI to the later gradual decline.\r"

Ex vivo T-cell depletion of the marrow graft has decreased the incidence and severity of GVHD, but has resulted in a higher incidence of graft failure and of relapse of the disease. In order to find an optimal T-cell number that avoids the extreme risks on both sides, we performed BMTs with a fixed low number of T cells. Thirty-one patients received marrow grafts, containing 1 x 10(5) T cells per kilogram body weight, from their HLA-identical sibs. All patients, except one, received cyclosporin A. Engraftment of donor marrow cells occurred in all patients and (late) graft rejections are not observed to date. Eighteen of 30 (60%) evaluable patients had acute GVHD, grade I (10 patients) or grade II (8 patients), limited to the skin in all patients. Chronic GVHD, also limited to the skin, was found in 9 of 27 (33%) evaluable patients. Incidence but not severity of GVHD in our study seems similar to that observed in non-T-cell depleted marrow grafting. Relapse was observed in 1 of 13 leukemic patients transplanted in first (or second) remission or first chronic phase with a follow-up of at least 6 months. These results suggest that with a fixed low number of T cells severe GVHD and failure to engraft can be avoided. More patients and longer follow-up are necessary for conclusions regarding relapse rate and late graft failure.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated infusion-related toxicities in 82 recipients of autologous bone marrow grafts. The grafts were cryopreserved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide and stored in liquid nitrogen. All grafts were concentrated and buffy-coat cells were collected. Forty-seven grafts were treated ex vivo with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) at 100 micrograms/mL; 26 grafts were further processed using density-gradient separation and treated with 4-HC at 60 micrograms/mL. Nine buffy-coat concentrates were frozen without drug treatment. Before infusion, patients were medicated with mannitol, hydrocortisone, and diphenhydramine. Grafts were rapidly thawed and immediately infused without further manipulation. During the infusions, 33 (70%) recipients of treated buffy-coat, 5 (56%) recipients of untreated buffy-coat, and 6 (23%) recipients of density-gradient separated grafts experienced varying symptoms including nausea, abdominal cramping, and flushing. Forced vital capacities for 83% of the recipients of treated buffy-coat concentrates decreased after the graft infusion; six of these patients complained of dyspnea and one patient experienced an acute episode of respiratory decompensation. Decreased heart rates were observed in 98% of the recipients of treated buffy-coat cells with asymptomatic bradycardia occurring in 45%. Forty-five patients (96%) in this group experienced transient hypertension, with 18 (38%) requiring additional medications within 6 hours after the infusion for control of blood pressure. Similar cardiovascular changes were observed in the recipients of untreated buffy-coat concentrates. One recipient of an untreated buffy-coat concentrate had 2 degrees heart block after the graft infusion. Twenty-three (88%) recipients of density-gradient separated grafts had decreased heart rates and 21 (81%) had increased blood pressure. However, the degrees of change were less than those experienced by the recipients of treated buffy-coat cells (P less than .01). Forced vital capacities were not affected by the infusion of the density-gradient separated grafts. No renal failure or obvious hemolytic episodes occurred for any patient group. Minor to moderate toxicities were associated with cryopreserved graft infusions. Recipients of buffy-coat separated grafts, both treated and untreated, experienced more complications than the recipients of density-gradient separated grafts. These toxicities may relate to the volumes of cryoprotectant and cell lysis products infused, which were less for the more highly purified density-gradient separated grafts.\r"

  ".W": "A retroviral vector (N2-SV-GC) was constructed by inserting a normal human glucocerebrosidase (GC) cDNA under control of the SV40 early region promoter into the Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived N2 vector. N2-SV-GC produced human GC in murine 3T3 fibroblasts at levels in the range of the endogenous murine GC as determined by enzymatic assay and Western blot analysis. The N2-SV-GC retroviral vector was used for studies of gene transduction of murine hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Infection of bone marrow cultured for 2 to 10 days in medium containing hematopoietic growth factors was significantly more efficient than infection of freshly isolated marrow cells (24% to 32% G418-resistant CFU-GM v 15%, respectively). The marrow infected by N2-SV-GC was maintained in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) and had a stable level of G418-resistant HPC over 2 months of serial assays. The human GC gene of the vector was persistently expressed in the nonadherent cell fraction of the murine LTBMC as determined by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining using a monoclonal antibody specific for human GC. N2-SV-GC also expressed the human GC gene in day 12 CFU-S. LTBMC represents a novel system for retroviral vector-mediated gene transduction of HPC and may accurately predict the activities of vectors in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90123202\r", 
  ".W": "Incubation of murine bone marrow and splenocytes with the dipeptide methyl ester, L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (Leu-Leu-OMe), which results in the selective depletion of cytotoxic T cells and their precursors, natural killer cells, and monocytes, completely protected 30 recipients of fully allogeneic donor grafts from lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These results were comparable with those obtained in 30 recipients of anti-Thy 1.2 plus complement (C')-treated donor marrow. However, in contrast to antibody- and C'-dependent T-cell depletion, which reduces the level of donor cell engraftment in our model system, we did not observe such effects using Leu-Leu-OMe marrow pretreatment. As compared with the 24 H-2 typed recipients of anti-Thy 1.2 + C'-treated donor grafts, the 29 H-2 typed recipients of Leu-Leu-OMe-treated donor grafts had significantly (P less than .001) higher percentages of donor cells (mean = 93% v 74%) and significantly (P less than .001) lower percentages of host cells (mean = 6% v 15%) posttransplantation. In vitro limiting dilution assay (LDA) was performed to assess the comparative efficacy of cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) precursor depletion by Leu-Leu-OMe or anti-Thy 1.2 + C' pretreatment. We observed greater levels of CTL precursor depletion in Leu-Leu-OMe treated as compared with anti-Thy 1.2 + C'-treated bone marrow plus spleen cells (BMS) obtained from nontransplanted mice. This suggests that the in vivo results cannot simply be attributed to a less efficacious functional inactivation of cytolytic T-cell precursors by Leu-Leu-OMe treatment as compared with anti-Thy 1.2 + C' treatment. Immunoreconstitution was similar in recipients of Leu-Leu-OMe-treated grafts and anti-Thy 1.2 + C'-treated grafts 100 days posttransplant. In our opinion, Leu-Leu-OMe marrow pretreatment deserves further investigation as a methodology to achieve GVHD prevention without significantly reducing the propensity toward host cell repopulation.\r"

  ".W": "The transfer of antigen-specific cellular immunity in human bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was studied in 49 donor-recipient pairs, using a varicella-zoster-virus (VZV) specific lymphoproliferative response (LPR) assay. Posttransplant VZV-LPR could be serially measured in 31 long-term surviving recipients. VZV-specific T-cell immunity was detected in the early posttransplant period in 4 of 16 recipients who were, and whose donors were, immune to VZV before BMT, but two of those positive responses diminished in the first 100 days posttransplant. No positive response was detected in the immediate posttransplant period when either only the recipient or the donor was immune to VZV pretransplant. Herpes zoster or chickenpox developed in the recipients depending on a history of pretransplant VZV infection when the VZV-LPR became negative, and recovery from VZV infection was always followed by quick conversion of VZV-LPR. Long-lasting positive VZV-LPR was observed in the two recipients who experienced VZV infection in the immediate pretransplant period and received marrow graft from an immune donor. Our results indicate that a simple or direct transfer of VZV-specific cellular immunity from a marrow donor to a recipient cannot be expected in usual clinical bone marrow transplantation and that there might be a collaboration or recruitment of immune responses involving both donor and recipient that permits the VZV-LPR to remain positive posttransplant.\r"

A striking positive correlation was established between urinary oxalate concentration and calcium oxalate crystal concentration as well as incidence of calcium oxalate crystals and aggregates seen by microscopy. A less striking relationship, also supported by light microscopy, was found between calcium oxalate crystal concentration and urinary calcium concentration. A small rise in calcium oxalate crystalluria was seen with increasing osmolality, but no relationship found between concentration or urinary urate, citrate or magnesium and that of calcium oxalate crystals. Higher levels of calcium oxalate crystal concentration appeared in alkaline urines in association with calcium phosphates. The dominance of urinary oxalate as a risk factor for calcium oxalate crystalluria is confirmed.\r"

In contrast, urinary macromolecules showed a strong inhibitory effect. THGP should, therefore, not be considered the main component of urinary macromolecules which have a strong inhibitory effect on crystal growth. However, THGP did enhance crystal production in the early phase of crystallisation. It appears that THGP should be viewed as a promoter rather than an inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystallisation at physiological concentrations.\r"

The basal cells contain prominent nuclei with condensed chromatin, nucleoli and nuclear bodies. The cytoplasm of these cells is rich in mitochondria. The profiles of the urothelial cells become progressively elongated, their nuclei increasingly smaller and their content of cell organelles gradually reduced as the luminal surface is approached. The squamous surface cells, linked by desmosomes, retain many longitudinally arranged fine filaments, together with an occasional degenerate nucleus. The mitotic index of pseudomembranous trigonitis is 0.17% (SD 0.09%), i.e. significantly higher than normal (0%).\r"

The results indicate that the natural history of sensory urgency is one of spontaneous resolution; all treatments of detrusor instability (including surgery) produced an unsustained short-term symptomatic response. This pattern of response to therapy may be interpreted as being largely of a placebo nature and this emphasises the need for long-term follow-up in the assessment of new treatment modalities.\r"

The Pereyra technique was first described in 1959 and modified by Raz in 1981. Stamey first described his technique in 1973 and this has been modified in a number of ways. The reported cure rates are 54 to 94% for the Pereyra-Raz procedure and 61 to 92% for the Stamey procedure. We present a comparative review of the technical results of treatment of 30 patients with a modified Stamey procedure and 17 patients with a modified Pereyra-Raz technique. The age range of the 2 groups was comparable. A successful result, with either complete continence or only minor occasional leaks after surgery, was achieved in 80% with the Stamey techniques and 76% with the Pereyra technique. Those patients not helped by the procedure had nearly all undergone previous surgery for incontinence. The Pereyra technique was used more frequently in patients who had failed previous incontinence surgery (including the Stamey technique). Complications were minor; 5 buffer infections occurred (3 buffers were removed). Both techniques offer a significant improvement in continence, but previous surgery is associated with a higher failure rate.\r"

The mean bowel frequency of patients during the test was 3 motions/day this being significantly different from their pre-operative bowel habit.

Thirty-six patients had a serum PSA greater than 10 micrograms/l and 7 had PAP levels greater than 5 iu/l. In no instance was the PAP elevated without an associated increase in PSA concentration. Patients with raised markers underwent further investigations which included prostatic biopsy and/or resection; 17 patients were proved to have carcinoma of the prostate, 9 of whom had distant metastases. The specificity of PSA for detecting prostate cancer in this study was 90% with a sensitivity of 89.5%, in contrast to values for PAP of 100% and 36.8%. The routine use of PAP as a marker for prostatic cancer should be abandoned. The use of PSA as a screening test in a group of patients with prostatism appears justified, but with a positive predictive value of only 47%, its use in a mass unselected screening programme is not recommended.\r"

A direct comparison with the normal population of different regions was available from the General Register Office of Scotland, obviating the need to use female statistics for comparison. The results showed that only very late surgical treatment of unilateral cryptorchidism affected fertility.\r"

There was a statistically significant difference in median between the 2 groups, but when a discriminant analysis was applied, sperm density could predict fertile status with only 68% accuracy at optimum cut-off. Sperm density is valueless in distinguishing fertile from infertile men and is neither useful in diagnosis nor in monitoring the progress of treatment for male infertility. It should be abandoned as a quotable measurement of male fertility.\r"

For only 17 patients was the question of future fertility of no importance. Pre-treatment semen cryopreservation was requested by 91 patients, but poor semen parameters made this procedure impossible in 38. Of 99 evaluable patients, 44 had a post-treatment sperm count greater than or equal to 10 x 10(6)/ml and 22 of these fathered a child after treatment. Post-treatment fertility was observed to the same degree in patients who had pre-treatment semen cryopreservation as in those in whom this procedure could not be performed. Four of 53 patients used their deep-frozen semen but only 1 pregnancy resulted. The intensity of treatment, especially the extent of retroperitoneal surgery, had a significant effect on post-treatment fertility in the individual patient. Pre-treatment cryopreservation of semen may be psychologically useful in patients with newly diagnosed testicular cancer, but its clinical significance is doubtful.\r"

This group included 1 of 20 patients in whom the retroperitoneal masses were less than or equal to 10 cm2 3 to 4 weeks after chemotherapy and 4 of 15 patients whose residual masses were greater than 10 cm2. Four of 11 patients with mediastinal tumours achieved a complete remission (mediastinal masses less than or equal to 1 cm2). However, 2 of these 4 patients relapsed, as did 2 of the 4 who achieved a partial remission. In no case was the original size of the tumour significantly related to treatment failure. Three patients had residual lung masses; 1 of these contained histological evidence of viable tumour. In one-third of the irradiated relapse-free patients, slightly enlarged masses were visible on follow-up computed tomography scans taken several years after treatment, even in patients without tumour activity. There is a 25% risk of relapse in patients with advanced seminoma who have retroperitoneal masses greater than 10 cm2 following cisplatin-based chemotherapy. They should be followed up regularly for many years.\r"

Cumulative graft patency was 58% (7 of 12 patients) up to 21 months but only 4 patients developed almost normal erections. Digital angiography, with and without the intracavernous injection of papaverine, was performed during follow-up to determine the vascular physiological status. At flaccidity, the corpora cavernosa were never opacified in the absence of a venocorporeal shunt. The penile glans was always visualised. Opacification of the deep dorsal vein and the circumflex system decreased with penile rigidity, resulting from their compression between Buck's fascia and the tunica albuginea. Intracavernous pressure recorded before and after the surgical procedure showed a marked increase when a caverno-venous shunt was performed. Hypervascularisation of the glans occurred in 2 cases. The relevance of this new surgical technique and its functional mechanism are discussed.\r"

Both 5-FU and 6-MP were effective in delaying iris tumour growth, as judged by daily clinical examination, histopathological study and reduction in tumour weight compared with control eyes after 17 days (group 2: p less than 0.001, p less than 0.05; group 3: p less than 0.025, p less than 0.05). The delay was correlated with earlier onset of treatment (group 2 v. 3: 5-FU, p less than 0.025; 6-MP, p less than 0.05). ARA-C and methotrexate were ineffective at the dosages used. Our results suggest that subconjunctivally administered 5-FU and 6-MP significantly delay tumour growth in this experimental model of iris melanoma and that efficacy is correlated with earlier initiation of treatment.\r"

Of these patients, 429 received postoperative irradiation (XRT) before adjuvant therapy. A group of 178 historical control patients had mastectomies and received irradiation after surgery without chemotherapy. The rates of locoregional recurrence alone in the three groups were as follows: FAC, 12%; FAC plus XRT, 5%; and XRT, 10%. The difference in recurrence rates between the FAC group and the FAC plus XRT subgroup was significant (P less than 0.01). Local failure rates were evaluated by stage and nodal status; patients with Stage III disease and those with four or more disease-positive nodes had a higher incidence of local failure than did patients with Stage II disease or those who had one to three positive nodes. Systemic chemotherapy and local therapies resulted in 50% local control at the time of locoregional recurrence in patients treated with FAC, whereas local control was achieved in 18% of patients with local recurrence in the XRT subgroups. Overall life-time local control of disease was similar whether irradiation was administered initially (in the period after operation) or at the time of local recurrence. Irradiation after mastectomy remains an integral part of a combined modality approach in selected groups of patients.\r"

Using a modified M.D. Anderson Hospital clinical staging system, 42 (69%) were Stage I, 16 (26%) were Stage IIA, and three (5%) were Stage IIB. Radiologic staging included both lymphangiogram (LAG) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Among Stage I disease, nine patients had false-positive CT scans, determined by negative LAG. Six patients had false-negative CT scans and were upstaged to Stage IIA by LAG. Treatment portals were altered in 15 of the 39 patients (38%) who had both LAG and CT scan. Overall actuarial survival (Kaplan-Meier method) was 97% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. Five-year survival corrected for intercurrent disease was 100% for Stage I, 100% for Stage IIA, and two of three in Stage IIB patients. There were two distant treatment failures among the entire cohort. One patient who had Stage I disease was salvaged with local-field radiation and chemotherapy and is now without evidence of disease for 6 years. The second patient with Stage IIB seminoma receiving the same treatments disseminated and died. There were no significant acute toxicities or serious complications. In summary, proper staging with information gained from LAG and adequate radiation dose led to a 92% 10-year disease-free survival.\r"

  ".W": "Primitive neuroectodermal tumors/medulloblastoma (PNET/MB) are the most common posterior fossa tumors in childhood. Despite surgery and radiation therapy, 40% to 50% of children with PNET/MB will have recurrent disease. Various chemotherapeutic agents are transiently effective in recurrent PNET/MB, but long-lasting responses are rarely attainable. To increase the rate and duration of response in children with recurrent PNET/MB, the authors treated seven patients (ages 2-18 years; median, 10 years) with lomustine (CCNU) (100 mg/m2), cisplatin (CPDD) (90 mg/m2) and vincristine (VCR) (1.5 mg/m2; maximum, 2 mg) in a 6-week cycle for a maximum of eight cycles. Six of six evaluable patients responded to chemotherapy. Four patients had a complete response; three with complete disappearance of tumor by imaging studies; and one with eradication of extraneural disease for a median of 24 months from relapse (13-29 months). Overall disease-free survival was 18.5 months. All six patients have subsequently died of recurrent tumor. Major toxicities consisted of reversible bone marrow suppression (six of six), high frequency hearing loss (six of six) and decreased renal function (three of six). All patients required dosage modification for toxicity. A regimen of CCNU, VCR, and CPDD is effective therapy in children with relapsed PNET/MB and can produce relatively long-term disease control with good quality of life. Further investigation into the efficacy of this combination as adjuvant chemotherapy in newly diagnosed high-risk PNET/MB is now being performed.\r"

Partial responses occurred in 11 of 44 evaluable patients (25%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13% to 40%). The median time to disease progression in responding patients was 4 months (range, 3 to 6+ months), whereas the median time to disease progression and survival for all patients who were treated were 3 and 7 months, respectively. There was marked toxicity related to this protocol treatment including pancytopenia, gastrointestinal upset, and renal insufficiency. Two treatment-related deaths occurred; one from sepsis and one from renal failure. Thus, this regimen, as second-line chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer, resulted in moderate, short-term, antitumor activity at the expense of marked toxicity.\r"

This was followed 24 hours later by a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at a dose of 960 mg/m2/d for five days every 3 to 4 weeks. There was universal alopecia. The other toxicities were mild and consisted of mucositis, nausea, vomiting, reversible creatininemia, and transient azotemia. After chemotherapy, five patients had a clinical partial response and one had a complete response. Of the five patients with no metastases, three had residual unresectable tumors. These three patients received radiation and survived for 6, 8, and 20 months after the start of chemotherapy. The other two patients were rendered disease-free by surgery. The first patient, who was a partial responder to chemotherapy, survived for 26 months. The second patient, who was a clinical complete responder, had excision of microscopic disease and is disease-free at 32+ months after the start of chemotherapy. This is the first article to report that the combination of cisplatin and 5-FU is active in penile and urethral carcinomas. After chemotherapy, surgery may be useful in selected patients to accurately assess response and excise localized residual tumors. Patients rendered tumor-free may achieve long-term survival.\r"

Dose intensity of high-dose methotrexate and doxorubicin was greater for the patients treated with the protocol initiated in 1977. The proportion of long-term disease-free survivors on the two protocols are 46% and 56%. A better outcome (P = 0.042) was seen for the latter group, which received more intensive chemotherapy. Overall, metastases developed in 35 patients; in 19 who were receiving chemotherapy and in 16 after chemotherapy. The outcome for these two protocols, compared with two control groups that were given no chemotherapy or ineffective chemotherapy (biweekly vincristine and cyclophosphamide), confirms the results of controlled studies that showed an advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy after amputation for osteosarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "A study was undertaken to test whether indium 111 (111In)-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (type ZCE 025) monoclonal intact antibody (MoAb) would concentrate in primary lung cancer enabling its detection and localization by scintigraphy. The scintigraphic results were correlated with chest radiograph, computed tomograph (CT), bronchoscopy, surgical resection, and tumor CEA analysis. Twenty adult male patients with clinical suspicion of primary lung cancer were studied. Each subject was infused with 4 to 5 mCi of 111In anti-CEA ZCE 025 MoAb, and planar and tomographic scintiphotos were obtained on days 3 and 6 or 7 postinfusion. The scintigraphy was true-positive in 12 of 16 patients with primary lung cancer, eight of nine patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and four of seven with adenocarcinoma; it was true-negative in three of four patients with benign lung disease with an overall accuracy of 75%. In seven patients with confirmed primary lung cancer, but with negative bronchoscopic findings, the scintigraphy was true-positive in four. In 11 patients with definitely positive or suspicious malignancy by bronchoscopy the monoclonal scintigraphy was positive in eight. In true-positive cases, the location and size of the lesion by 111In anti-CEA ZCE 025 MoAb imaging correlated well with CT findings and also tumor mass at surgery. Only one of 12 tumors stained positive for CEA had serum CEA levels greater than 10 ng/ml, indicating nonleakage of the tumor antigen into general circulation in early lung cancer. It is concluded that 111In anti-CEA ZCE 025 MoAb planar and tomographic imaging shows potential to serve as a noninvasive diagnostic test in the evaluation of primary lung cancer. The lung lesion is likely to be malignant if it concentrates 111In anti-CEA ZCE 025 MoAb and benign if it does not. Further studies in large number of patients with suspected primary lung cancer are needed to define the ultimate role for MoAb scintigraphy.\r"

The results of this analysis showed that the NC activity of patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy protocols that included dexamethasone was reduced significantly 24 hours after treatment compared with before treatment (P less than 0.001). The addition of dexamethasone (at a concentration equivalent to the plasma level of patients treated with dexamethasone) to the in vitro assay of NC activity caused a significant decrease in NC activity compared with when dexamethasone was not added (P less than 0.001). There was no cumulative effect of dexamethasone in that the reduction of NC activity by dexamethasone was not significantly different in patients who had been treated previously at least four times and in patients who were treated for the first time. When dexamethasone was not included in the chemotherapy protocol the NC activity of 19 patients was not reduced 24 hours after treatment. These results indicate that dexamethasone causes a significant reduction in NC activity. Although the tumor surveillance role of human NC cells in vivo has not been established, the effect of dexamethasone on NC cells suggests that additional research of the effect of dexamethasone in cisplatin-based chemotherapy protocols is warranted.\r"

Few have attempted to confirm these findings. Given the potential application of the observations of Nieburgs et al., a quantitative investigation seemed necessary. Two groups were studied: 40 patients with malignant disease outside the oral cavity and 40 healthy patients attending for routine dental treatment. Both groups were matched for age and sex, with anemia excluded. Quantitative cytologic assessment of nuclear (NA) and cytoplasmic area (CA) and DNA distribution (using DNA cytophotometric study) were calculated from cells in normal buccal mucosal smears. No significant difference in NA (P = 0.28) was found between the two groups. However, a significant reduction in CA (P = 0.005) was found within the distant malignancy group. DNA distribution was invariably diploid. Previous studies on the effect of distant malignancy and nutritional deficiency have concentrated on examination of the nucleus, with exclusion of the cytoplasm. Important changes, such as the one reported, may therefore have gone unrecorded, particularly since oral smears have rarely been quantitatively assessed. The cause of this decrease in CA in distant malignancy patients is discussed with regard to the patients' nutritional state. The buccal smear may yet prove of value in assessing nutritional deficiency consequent to internal malignancy.\r"

Tumor cells stained positively for tissue factor, a protein that is capable of activating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation (the components of which have been seen within small cell carcinoma of the lung [SCCL] tissue), and for proteins C and S antigens. Fibrin was seen in a focal distribution at the host-tumor interface, indicating that thrombin had acted upon the fibrinogen found throughout the tumor stroma. Staining with a neoepitope-specific antibody, which does not discriminate between fibrinogen fragment D and fibrin fragment D-dimer, was similar to that of the fibrin antibody. High molecular weight urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activators were seen in vascular endothelium, but neither existed within the tumor. Low molecular weight urokinase was found in rare isolated foci of tumor cells primarily adjacent to areas of necrosis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-3 occurred in tumor cell cytoplasmic blebs and in necrotic tumor cells, but plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 were not seen. Our data suggest a mechanism for thrombin generation and fibrin formation within SCCL tissues that could support cell proliferation, stroma formation, and preservation. These features could be conductive to perpetuation of this tumor and conceivably could form the basis of the beneficial effects of antithrombotic therapy seen in SCCL.\r"

When the occurrence of the GM2 antigen was tested in 107 cases of human germ cell tumors by the immunohistochemical technique using these antibodies, seminoma was characterized as having the highest frequency of N-acetyl GM2 (89.4%, 42 of 47 cases) among germ cell tumors, followed by embryonal carcinoma (40.0%), and teratocarcinoma (26.6%). Compared with this, yolk sac tumors and choriocarcinoma had a much lower positive incidence of the N-acetyl GM2 antigen. On the other hand, the N-glycolyl GM2 antigen was not found at all in 47 cases of seminoma (0%), and the positive incidence was very low in embryonal carcinoma (6.6%), although considerably higher incidences were obtained with choriocarcinoma (25.0%), yolk sac tumor (22.2%), and teratocarcinoma (13.3%). The presence and molecular species of the GM2 antigens in these human germ cell tumors were also ascertained chemically by the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining of the ganglioside fractions prepared from primary germ cell tumors. These results indicate that seminoma specifically contains N-acetyl GM2 and no N-glycolyl GM2, suggesting that N-acetyl GM2 could be a good marker for seminoma. On the other hand, non-seminomatous germ cell tumors were characterized by the presence of N-glycolyl GM2, one of the Hanganutziu-Deicher antigens (H-D antigens). Moreover, the positive occurrence of N-glycolyl GM2 correlated very well with the degree of differentiation of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, i.e., the differentiated tumors such as yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinoma, and teratocarcinoma had a higher positive incidence of N-glycolyl GM2 type H-D antigen but a lower positive incidence of N-acetyl GM2 when compared with embryonal carcinoma, the most undifferentiated tumors among non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.\r"

Most, if not all, bronchial mucus obtained from patients without pulmonary diseases during general anesthesia contained remarkably high levels of CA125, CA19-9, and CEA ranging from 190 to 41,000 U/ml (594-4803 U/mg protein), 210 to 95,000 U/ml (294-197,917 U/mg protein), and 6 to 940 ng/ml (14-209 ng/mg protein), respectively, whereas serum antigen levels were normal in all cases examined.

Morphologically identified tumor cells were analyzed by an image cytometric method. The DNA histograms were classified (1) by an objective method in which the degree of aneuploidy was defined as the percentage number of tumor cells with DNA values exceeding the 90th percentile of diploid control cells (P90), and (2) according to a subjective evaluation of whether the DNA profiles represented a euploid or an aneuploid DNA pattern. Both classifications separated groups with marked differences (P less than 0.001) in survival. A multivariate proportional hazards analysis indicated that each method provided additional information when the other one was taken into account. In patients whose tumors were classified according to the objective P90 method 1, the relative hazards (with 95% confidence interval) in the groups with P90 values of 36% to 69% and greater than or equal to 70% were 1.6 (0.9-2.8) and 2.1 (1.1-4.0) respectively, compared with the reference group. With the subjective method 2 the corresponding figure for the group with aneuploid tumors was 1.7 (1.0-2.0) compared with the group with euploid tumors.\r"

The proliferations were divided into regular or ordinary intraductal hyperplasia (IDH) (117 cases) and atypical intraductal hyperplasia (AIDH) (82 cases). The average length of follow-up was 14 years for the patients with IDH and 12.4 years for the patients with AIDH. Of the 117 patients with ordinary IDH, carcinoma subsequently developed in six (5%); three of these were invasive carcinomas (2.6%). All three invasive carcinomas were in the ipsilateral breast, but of the three intraductal carcinomas (IDCa), two were in the contralateral breast. Of the 82 patients with AIDH, invasive carcinoma subsequently developed in eight (9.8%); six of these were located in the ipsilateral breast and two in the contralateral breast. One of these six patients died of disseminated carcinoma. The average interval to the subsequent carcinoma (intraductal and invasive carcinoma) was about the same in the two groups (8.3 years for AIDH and 8.8 years for IDH lacking atypia). When considering only subsequent invasive carcinomas, the interval was 8.3 years for the AIDH and 14.3 years for the IDH lacking atypia. Of the 14 patients with IDH and a family history of breast carcinoma, invasive carcinoma subsequently developed in one (7%) as compared with two (2%) of the 91 with a negative family history. Among patients with AIDH, invasive carcinoma subsequently developed in two of the 13 (15%) of those with a family history of breast carcinoma as compared with one of 57 (1.8%) of the women with a negative family history. The presence of atypia in epithelial hyperplasia is a significant factor in increasing the likelihood of the development of subsequent invasive carcinoma (P = 0.03; two-tailed test). Of women with AIDH, invasive carcinoma subsequently developed in 17% of those with sclerosing adenosis (SA) as compared with 4.2% of those without it. Therefore, SA may be a contributing factor to increased risk. A positive family history also appears to increase the likelihood of the subsequent development of invasive carcinoma, particularly in patients with AIDH.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the prognostic value of DNA ploidy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we performed a flow cytometric study using paraffin-embedded archival material from 158 patients who underwent surgical resection between 1980 and 1982. Single-variable histograms were examined and the results of these histograms were correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics and outcome. Histograms that could be analyzed were obtained in 146 cases, of which 85 (58%) were aneuploid and 61 (42%) were diploid. Survival analysis showed that patients with diploid squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) survived significantly longer than those with aneuploid SCC (a 5-year survival rate of 70% as compared with 26% [P = 0.002], respectively), and the results were independent of stage. However, DNA ploidy was not a significant prognostic factor in non-SCC (P = 0.337). Ploidy did not correlate with other clinicopathologic variables such as stage, nodal status, degree of differentiation, nuclear grade, and mitotic rate. These results suggest that DNA ploidy, as determined by flow cytometric analysis, provides an independent prognostic variable for patients with SCC and that it should be considered in treatment planning. However, non-SCC of lung may have different biologic variables, and their prognostic variables should be evaluated separately.\r"

Seventy-seven of the 82 cases had at least a 5-year follow-up and 50 had at least a 10-year follow-up. Three of these 77 cases had Grade 1 (well-differentiated) metastases, 59 (77%) had Grade 2-3 (moderately differentiated) metastases, and 15 (19%) had Grade 4 (poorly differentiated) metastases (M. D. Anderson Hospital [MDAH] grading system). The patients with moderately differentiated metastases had 5-year and 10-year survival rates of 79% and 34%, respectively, whereas the patients with poorly differentiated metastases had 5-year and 10-year survival rates of 13% and 0%, respectively (P less than 0.0001). This study demonstrates a statistically significant difference between the prognosis of Stage D1 patients with moderately differentiated metastases and Stage D1 patients with poorly differentiated metastases. Consequently, the evaluation of the histologic appearance of Stage D1 metastases may be of clinical importance.\r"

The results show numeric differences between the two groups for the first five parameters. A statistical analysis was performed between BCC1 and BCC2 for all the considered parameters using a two-sided t test for independent samples. The test showed significant differences between the first five parameters except for the two form factors. A multivariate analysis was performed using area and perimeter values of the compared groups that amplified the discrimination threshold between the two groups.

Median age was 34 years (range, 17-64 years). Original stage distribution was as follows: 32 Stage II, 46 Stage III, and four Stage IV. Peritoneal implants in 72 patients were classified as benign (22 patients), noninvasive (37), or invasive (13). For ten patients, implants were clinically documented but histologic material was unavailable. The most common sites of peritoneal implants included the pelvic peritoneum (42), omentum (33), uterus (33), and fallopian tube (26). All patients underwent primary surgery. Postoperative therapy consisted of radiotherapy in 18 patients, single-agent chemotherapy in 37 patients, combination chemotherapy in 25 patients, and no therapy in two patients. Second-look laparotomy documented response to chemotherapy in 42% of patients with no gross residual disease and in 80% of patients with macroscopic residual disease (40% complete response, 40% partial response). Disease-free survival rates were 95% at 5 years and 91% at 10 years. The International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage, extent of residual disease, type of postoperative treatment, and type of peritoneal implants had no effect on survival. Based on a comparison of the present study's findings with those in the literature, the authors propose possible explanations for differences in survival by type of peritoneal implants and outline recommendations for clinical management until further studies elucidate the role of postoperative therapy.\r"

Two pulmonary carcinomas were excluded because neuroendocrine features could not be demonstrated; two additional cases also were excluded because the tumors grossly invaded the chest wall and their pulmonary origin was not substantiated. Thirty-four tumors were confirmed to be small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC). Only seven of 11 (64%) patients with T1N0,T2N0 tumors survived more than 1 year; one of 11 (9%) patients survived more than 2 years. In 12 cases, the diagnosis was changed to well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (WDNC). Of these, nine of nine (100%) patients with T1N0,T2N0 tumors survived more than 1 year; six of eight (75%) patients survived more than 2 years. These observations strongly indicate that a significant number of long-term survivors with the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma may, in fact, have a distinctly less aggressive type of pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. It was concluded that the distinction between small cell and well-differentiated types of neuroendocrine carcinomas has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "The clinicopathologic features and response to therapy of 28 patients with non-Ewing's flat bone sarcoma treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, over a 25-year period were reviewed. Twenty-two patients had osteosarcoma, four malignant fibrous histiocytoma, one chondrosarcoma, and one fibrosarcoma. Ages at diagnosis ranged from 3 to 24 years (median, 15 years). Primary sites were craniofacial bones in ten patients, pelvis eight, scapula four, ribs two, metatarsal bones two, clavicle one, and vertebra one. All primary tumors were associated with soft tissue extension; none of the patients had metastatic disease at presentation. Six cases represented second malignancies that arose 5 to 16 years after irradiation for an unrelated tumor. Complete excision was possible in ten patients, eight of whom received postoperative chemotherapy. Five of these patients remain free of disease 1.8+ to 13+ years (median, 8.1 years) from diagnosis. Prolonged remissions after adjuvant chemotherapy were achieved in only two of 18 patients after incomplete surgical resection or biopsy. The median survival time in this group was 1 year (range, 0.2-7.7+ years). The remaining 16 patients had progressive local disease, but only two developed concurrent metastases. Thus, complete surgical resection appears to maximize disease-free survival in patients with non-Ewing's flat bone sarcoma. For the large percentage of patients in whom total resection is not possible, because of soft tissue extension and local invasion of bulky tumors, preoperative chemotherapy may increase the likelihood of complete excision and improve long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate can be difficult on needle biopsy specimens. Nucleolar prominence has proven to be a useful diagnostic variable, but its objective evaluation has had limited study. To find nucleolar criteria that might differentiate benign from malignant conditions, we examined 41 open prostatectomy specimens, 25 of which were removed for well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and 16 of which were removed for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Four acini of carcinoma, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), nodular hyperplasia, and normal tissue were examined. The total number of nuclei with nucleoli 3 microns or greater (N'), the fraction of nuclei with nucleoli 3 microns or greater (N'/N), and the average diameters of nucleoli 3 microns or greater (AVG) were recorded. Hyperplastic and normal areas, when compared with carcinoma, had significantly smaller N',N'/N, and AVG values (P less than 0.005). The N' and N'/N values were significantly higher in hyperplasia when compared with normal acini (P less than 0.005). In addition, N' and N'/N values in PIN were significantly greater than those in AAH (P less than 0.0001). In comparing prostates with and without carcinoma, N' and N'/N were significantly different for hyperplastic areas. In only two cancer areas and one PIN area was the N'/N ratio less than 0.31, which was the highest value for either hyperplastic or normal areas. Although AVG also were significantly different, they did not improve discrimination between the groups. We conclude that N'/N ratios are useful in diagnosing well-differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma on small tissue samples.\r"

The intestinal location of the tumor, its high-grade malignancy and B-cell origin are all features of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

  ".W": "Eighty-six cases of advanced gastric carcinoma simulating early gastric carcinoma were studied clinicopathologically. Cytophotometric DNA analysis was also performed in 33 cases. Most of these particular carcinomas were of the depressed type on gross inspection. Histologically, the tumors were of diffuse type in 60%. The rate of the carcinomas restricted to within the muscularis propria was 48% and high in comparison with those in conventional advanced gastric carcinomas. There were four main growth patterns: small invasion type (Type A, 43 cases), ulcer-connected type (Type B, 19 cases), vessel permeation type (Type C, six cases), and diffusely infiltrative type (Type D, 13 cases). There was a relationship between growth patterns, lymph node metastasis, and prognosis: Types A and B had a small percentage of lymph node metastasis and a good prognosis, whereas Types C and D a high percentage and a poor prognosis. DNA analysis revealed that two thirds of the examined cases showed a low ploidy pattern. The DNA ploidy patterns were concerned with the tumor growth pattern: high-ploidy cases were rarely seen in Types A and B yet were frequent in Types C and D. The 5-year survival rate was 73%, but results were poor in cases of tumors with blood vessel permeation, in those with lymph node metastasis, in those with the Type D or C growth patterns, and in those with high DNA ploidy pattern. Since these carcinomas can be understaged endoscopically and by gross examination, a precise study of the surgically excised tissues will aid in making an accurate prognosis.\r"

When compared with a similar survey that studied prescription practices 10 years ago, there was a 30% increase in the use of psychotropic agents. Whereas prescription rates for different drug classes remained relatively stable, psychotropic drugs are now used for a greater range of reasons. The introduction of several new agents, especially short-acting benzodiazepines, has altered the physician's choices. Despite awareness of the different properties of psychotropic medications and their increased use, they are still underused, especially the antidepressants and antipsychotics when prescribed for psychologic distress.\r"

Also, the status of the newborn was evaluated. There were 33 pregnancies in 25 patients (10 pregnancies were terminated, 2 patients had spontaneous abortions, and 19 patients gave birth to full-term offspring without fetal malformation). Two patients were still pregnant at the time of this report. The median interval between the completion of chemotherapy and pregnancy was 12 months. Eight patients who became pregnant experienced temporary amenorrhea during chemotherapy. Of the 25 patients who became pregnant, recurrent disease subsequently developed in 7 and 3 died. A patient's disease-free and overall survival status was not adversely effected by pregnancy. These data illustrate that in a sizeable fraction of patients 35 years of age or younger treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-containing therapy, ovarian function remained intact and subsequent pregnancy did not affect the disease-free or overall survival of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-three patients with nonmetastatic inflammatory breast carcinoma have been treated by initial doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) combination chemotherapy. After three chemotherapy cycles, responding patients underwent surgery. Chemotherapy was then completed for nine cycles of FAC followed by locoregional radiation therapy. All patients received tamoxifen 40 mg/day for 1 year from the time of diagnosis. Thirty-eight patients (88%) had a clinical response to chemotherapy and underwent surgery. On histologic examination 17 patients had a residual tumor mass less than 1 cm diameter or a complete tumor disappearance; lymph nodes dissection was negative in 15 patients. With a median follow-up of 48 months, the predicted 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) is 48% (median DFS, 46 months). Analysis of prognosis factors shows that age, menopausal status, and histologic grade have no predictive value. The DFS and overall survival were significantly improved by the presence of hormonal receptors and a low number of positive lymph nodes (less than 4) at surgery. The most significant prognosis factor was the residual tumor mass after initial chemotherapy with an 80% predicted 5-year DFS for the responding patients versus 30% for the no responding patients (P less than 0.001).\r"

  ".W": "A Phase II study of the combination of etoposide (VP-16) and cyclophosphamide (CPM) was conducted in an attempt to identify active and potentially less toxic agents for treating patients with osteogenic sarcoma (OS). VP-16 was given as a 72-hour infusion for a total dose of 600 mg/m2. CPM was given as six pulses of 300 mg/m2 every 12 hours for a total dose of 1800 mg/m2. Seventeen newly diagnosed patients, including five (29%) with metastatic disease, were evaluated before and after two courses of VP-16 and CPM for clinical, radiologic, and biochemical (serum alkaline phosphatase [SAP]) responses of the primary tumor and metastases. Fifteen (88%) patients achieved complete or partial clinical responses. Fourteen (82%) patients achieved radiologic responses. Thirteen (87%) of 15 patients with higher than normal SAP levels for their age showed partial or complete responses. Three (60%) of the five patients with metastatic disease achieved complete or partial responses. The only major toxicity was myelosuppression, which led to 21 (62%) brief admissions after 34 courses of chemotherapy for intravenous antibiotic therapy for fever and neutropenia, without associated mortality. It was concluded that the combination of VP-16 and CPM is effective chemotherapy for both primary and metastatic OS. Although myelosuppression is inevitable, it is rapidly reversible in the drug dosages used. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of these drugs in combination with established agents in improving the disease-free survival of patients with OS.\r"

Six patients were ineligible for the following reasons: poor performance status (two patients); ineligible diagnosis (three patients, two with Ewing's sarcoma of bone and one with metastatic chondrosarcoma); and evaluable but nonmeasurable disease (one patient with bone-only disease). Of the 40 fully evaluable patients, 34 had received prior chemotherapy; treatment was with cisplatin (40 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days). Cisplatin was mixed in 250 ml of 3% NaCl and hydrated with a normal saline solution at a rate of 250 ml/h, beginning 12 hours before the first dose of cisplatin was specified. The second treatment was given 3 weeks after the first, with all subsequent treatments given every 4 weeks. After three cycles of treatment, responding patients were treated at a cisplatin dose of 20 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days. Leukopenia was of Grade 3 or 4 in seven patients, whereas thrombopenia was of Grade 3 or 4 in eight patients. More severe myelosuppression was produced in patients who had received prior radiotherapy. A single case of reversible Grade 4 nephrotoxicity was produced; neurotoxicity was observed in 11 cases, but was of Grade 3 in only 2 cases. Of the 40 evaluable cases, six showed partial responses or no responses, for a major response rate of 15%. High-dose cisplatin has minor activity and major toxicity in the treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcomas, and should be considered investigational.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the possible cardiosparing effect of a prolonged infusion of doxorubicin as compared with the standard mode of administration 62 consecutive patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast or carcinoma of the ovary Stage III or IV were prospectively randomized to receive doxorubicin either as a rapid infusion over 15 to 20 minutes at 8 AM or as a continuous infusion over 6 hours, 8 AM to 2 PM. The remaining protocol was identical for the two groups. The cardiotoxic effect of doxorubicin was evaluated by history and physical examination and by the decline in resting ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by gated pool radionuclide angiography with technetium 99m (99mTc) and by the decline in the height of the QRS complexes in the standard leads of the echocardiogram (ECG). Initially there were 31 patients in each group. The cumulative dose of doxorubicin, was 410 mg/m2 +/- 42 SD in the standard infusion group and 428 mg/m2 +/- 48 SD in the 6-hour infusion group. The mean decline in LVEF after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 was 17% in the first group and only 4.1% in the second. After 400 mg/m2 the mean fall in LVEF was 21% in the first group and 6% in the second. The mean decline in QRS voltage after 300 mg/m2 was 29% and 1.5%, respectively. Four patients, all in the standard infusion group, developed congestive heart failure. These data suggest that slow infusion of doxorubicin is associated with reduced cardiotoxicity.\r"

The other two patients received prolonged antifungal treatment concurrently with chemotherapy and both are alive, one of them cured and in complete remission. The increasing frequency of this infection in recent years and the importance of a prompt and prolonged administration of antifungal therapy to obtain the cure are discussed.\r"

Therefore, the authors prospectively assessed the thrombogenicity of this agent by studying ten patients, six with head and neck cancer and four with gastrointestinal malignancies, receiving 5-FU (1 g/m2/day) as a constant intravenous infusion over a 4-day or 5-day period. The six patients with head and neck cancer also received a single dose of 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 1. Blood samples were obtained preinfusion, 24 hours into the infusion, and postinfusion. Samples were assayed for fibrinopeptide A (FpA) by enzyme-linked immunoassay, for protein C activity (PCa) using a chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme PCa), and protein C (PCag) and free protein S antigen (PSag) by electroimmunoassay. No patient experienced a thrombotic event. A significant increase was observed in FpA levels during the infusion which returned toward baseline at the conclusion of the infusion. After infusion of 5-FU, the PCa value was significantly lower than the PCag (37 +/- 17 versus 69 +/- 24%; P less than 0.002). No effect on protein S was observed. The changes in the patients receiving 5-FU alone were comparable to those who also received CDDP. The authors conclude that during the infusion of 5-FU, the rise in FpA activation and reduction in PCa as compared to PCag are compatible with activation of coagulation.\r"

All ten patients, had typical pancreatographic findings of CP, combined with an elongated narrowing of the duct of Wirsung. Marked localized irregularity of the adjacent main duct and of side branches were found in all ten patients. Such findings were not detected in the other 45 patients with CP only. Ultrasonography or computed tomography have detected a definite pancreatic mass in only five of these patients, and in six patients with CP without malignancy. It is concluded that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is highly accurate in detecting pancreatic cancer coexisting with CP. It is primarily helpful in elderly patients having severe degrees of CP to rule out cancer.\r"

To clarify the mechanism of this resistance, the boundaries of hepatocellular carcinomas and their relationship to the blood supply were studied. The boundaries of the hepatocellular carcinomas studied were classified as one of five types: encapsulated, granulation, stromal, replacing, or sinusoidal. The granulation and stromal types had a capsule-like structure, but lacked the hyalinization which is the hallmark of a true tumor capsule. The granulation and stromal types could also be differentiated from the encapsulated type because of their different blood supplies and the differing effects of transcatheter arterial embolization. When barium sulfate was infused into the portal vein, it did not enter into encapsulated tumors, but it entered granulation and stromal type tumors. Small nodules such as daughter nodules and intrahepatic metastases do not have capsules, and so have a blood supply that makes them resistant to conventional transcatheter arterial embolization therapy.\r"

Cells cultured in a medium that contains various concentrations (from 10 to 1000 IU/ml) of interferons showed a growth inhibition, which reaches the maximum after a 6-day treatment, at the highest dose used. Furthermore, we studied the effect of both beta-IFN and alpha-IFN on the level of glucocorticoid receptors. This was enhanced more than 30% with respect to control in HL-60 cells exposed for 24 hours to concentrations of beta-IFN that ranged from 100 to 1000 IU/ml. The increase of the receptor amount was seen even if cells were treated for 5 days, and was not accompanied by a modification of antigen expression of HL-60 cells. alpha-IFN did not modify the glucocorticoid receptor level substantially in our experimental conditions. Our data indicate that both beta-IFN and alpha-IFN regulate HL-60 cell proliferation. Additional studies are required to clarify if modifications of the receptor level induced by beta-IFN could be related to the modulation of hormone-sensitivity in this model.\r"

The NK cell activity was markedly decreased in HCC patients and the LC group as compared with the control group, but there was no statistical difference between the NK cell activity of the HCC group and the LC group. The depression of NK cell activity in HCC patients was inversely correlated with the patient's age, and the HCC patients with venous invasion or with both lobes involved had lower NK cell activity. These results suggest that the decreased NK cell activity in HCC patients might be related to the coexistent liver disease, and marked decrease in NK cell activity might be one of the causes for the early development and invasion of HCC.\r"

  ".W": "Cytogenetic analyses were performed on 12 adult patients with abnormal megakaryoblastic proliferation which was detected by ultrastructural cytochemical study (platelet peroxidase) and platelet-megakaryocytes-specific monoclonal antibodies (TP-80, Plt1, AN51, and KOR-77). The patients consisted of two patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), three with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), six with megakaryoblastic transformation in Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-meg-BC), and one case of chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD). Among them, an inversion of the long arm of chromosome 3 [inv(3)(q21q26)] was found in one AMKL patient with a normal platelet count. Chromosome change at band 3q26 was also found in one MDS patient without thrombocythemia. Furthermore, the long arm of chromosome 13, where rearrangements in myelofibrosis are clustered (13q12----q22) was seen in one MDS patient. Trisomoy of chromosome 19 was found in one AMKL patient and three CML-meg-BC patients. These findings indicate that cytogenetic abnormalities involving 3q26, 13q, and trisomy 19 are associated with hematologic neoplasia with megakaryocytic lineage in adult patients, although these abnormalities were not related to the survival of the patients. During the period of this study, two acute myelogenous leukemia patients (AML-M2 and AML-M5b) with chromosome rearrangements at band 3q21 and thrombocythemia were found, indicating that chromosome abnormality at band 3q21 is related to quantitative platelet dysfunction, whereas that at 3q26 is related to hematologic malignancies with a proliferation of megakaryocytic lineage.\r"

  ".W": "The concentrations of three sex steroids, estradiol, progesterone and testosterone, were analyzed by radioimmunoassay after celite chromatography in brain tumor and breast cancer tissues. The concentrations in malignant gliomas and breast cancers showed interindividual variations, especially evident with regard to estradiol. High estradiol concentrations were recorded in two patients with malignant astrocytoma. The concentrations of 1.00 pg/mg and 3.32 pg/mg were 10 to 30 times as high as in normal female brain. In five of ten astrocytomas the estradiol concentration was higher than the lowest breast cancer value. The distribution of progesterone seemed more even, and the level was significantly lower in brain tumors and breast cancers as compared with female brain, perhaps indicating an increased metabolism. Testosterone levels were somewhat higher in brain tumors, as compared with breast cancers, but not different from values in brain tissue. There were no significant age or sex correlation or differences in the concentrations of steroids in the brain tumors. The results suggest that manipulation of sex steroid metabolism in malignant brain tumors can be of beneficial therapeutic value as has been shown for breast cancer and prostatic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Total, free, and acetylated polyamine concentrations were measured simultaneously in colon tissue, serum, and urine of 50 patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer, 40 patients with nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases, and 30 healthy volunteers. Compared with histologically unaffected colon tissue, concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher for putrescine, elevated for cadaverine, and nearly identical for spermidine and spermine in colon carcinoma, whereas N1-acetylated and N8-acetylated spermidine were detectable in cancer tissue only. Serum and urine concentrations of all polyamines except total cadaverine and spermine in serum and free spermine in urine were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls and highest sensitivity for colon cancer was found for total spermidine (89.15%) in serum and acetylputrescine (84.5%), total putrescine (84.0%), N1-acetylspermidine (79.3%), and total spermidine (92.1%) in urine. However, nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases partly showed similar elevations which resulted in a low specificity for polyamines in colorectal cancer. Therefore, polyamines are of little value only as diagnostic markers in colorectal carcinoma. Since polyamine concentrations in serum and urine normalized in patients after curative operation while they were further elevated in patients with proven tumor relapse or metastases, these substances might play a clinical role in predicting therapeutic success or indicating relapse of the tumor. Although a significant dependency of polyamine concentrations in serum or urine to Dukes' classification, tumor localization, CEA, CA 19-9, or CA 125 did not exist, a significant linear correlation was found for tumor size.\r"

Sections of all lymph nodes were also examined by immunohistochemical study for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) expression using the indirect immunoperoxidase staining method. All 49 lymph node metastases (100%) from 20 patients stained positively for CEA and 45 (92%) expressed EMA. Of the 200 lymph nodes without metastases on light microscopic examination, anti-CEA revealed a single micrometastasis in a patient staged as Dukes' B. No additional metastases were detected with anti-EMA. In this series of patients immunohistochemical study has, therefore, influenced the histologic staging in only one patient (2%) and thus does not offer a significant benefit over conventional histologic staging.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of 78 cases of peripheral/post-thymic T-cell lymphomas are described. These neoplasms were extremely heterogeneous and were classified as small lymphocytic, mixed small and large cell, large cell, lymphoepithelioid cell, angiocentric, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma type. Some cases revealed angioimmunoblastic or Hodgkin's-like features. These neoplasms mainly affected older adults (mean age, 57 years; median age, 60 years). Lymphadenopathy represented the most frequent clinical presentation, although most patients demonstrated both nodal (87%) and extranodal involvement (77%) during the course of disease. Sites of extranodal disease included skin/soft tissue, spleen, lung, liver, bone, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, peripheral blood, nasopharynx, and retrovaginal tissue. Splenomegaly at presentation was most frequently observed in lymphoepithelioid cell lymphomas. Angiocentric lymphomas involved lung. A mediastinal presentation was typically observed in young adults and associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with gastrointestinal lymphomas presented with bleeding and/or malabsorption. B symptoms were present in most cases (65%). Hypercalcemia occurred in four patients. Phenotypic studies of T-cell antigens demonstrated the loss of one or more pan-T-cell markers in eight of 47 cases evaluated. Assessment of T-cell subsets revealed a helper/inducer phenotype for nearly all immunoreactive cases. For the overall series, 32 patients died of disease (median survival time, 11.5 mo). There was a statistical difference between the combined groups of small lymphocytic and lymphoepithelioid cell types as compared with mixed and large cell types, with a poorer survival for the latter group. Angiocentric and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma were associated with poor survival. This series of T-cell lymphomas further documents the marked heterogeneity of this group of neoplasms as well as the poor prognosis observed for certain histologic types.\r"

Recognition of the symptoms characteristic of these fractures (vague thigh pain, diffuse tenderness, no trauma) will assist early diagnosis. Early definitive diagnosis can be made by radionuclide scanning or later, by plain radiography, if symptoms have been present for a sufficient period. Diagnosis is not limited to novice runners since runners with significant mileage, or baseball or basketball players, can develop femoral shaft stress fractures.\r"

Thus, the effect of central beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with L-propranolol (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg) on ischemia-induced VF vulnerability was evaluated in the psychologically stressed pig model and compared with Ringer's solution and D-propranolol (0.05 mg/kg). The ischemia of a maximum 15-minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was used since we previously determined that pigs surviving 15 minutes usually do not fibrillate. Time to the onset of VF was analyzed by time-to-event analysis and ranged from 0.75 to 13.8 minutes in vulnerable pigs. Intracerebroventricular administration of L-propranolol (0.05 mg/kg) prolonged the time to VF compared with Ringer's solution and D-propranolol (p less than 0.05). The high dose of L-propranolol also reduced the incidence of VF (7/15 fibrillated) compared with Ringer's solution (12/12 fibrillated) and D-propranolol (6/7 fibrillated). The lower dose of L-propranolol was without effect on VF vulnerability (7/9) fibrillated). The plasma concentration resulting from central administration of 0.05 mg/kg L-propranolol was found to be 9.05 +/- 3.25 ng/ml, which is significantly below therapeutic antiarrhythmic blood levels. We conclude that the reduced vulnerability to ischemia-induced VF after intracerebroventricular administration of propranolol is due to alteration of a central beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated phenomenon as opposed to an effect on the heart directly or to nonspecific membrane stabilization.\r"

The purpose of these studies was to characterize the rates of pyruvate and lactate oxidation during comparable periods of reflow. In the main protocol, pyruvate oxidation was defined at two conditions of coronary flow and at two levels of fatty acids in the coronary perfusate. Twenty animals were prepared using the extracorporeally perfused, working swine heart model. In five control (group 1) hearts, flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery was maintained at aerobic levels during a 115-minute perfusion trial. In 15 hearts (groups 2 and 3), flow was held at aerobic levels for 30 minutes, reduced acutely by 60% for 45 minutes, and restored again to aerobic levels for the final 40-minute reflow. In the five control hearts and in 10 of the reperfused hearts (group 2), 20% Intralipid (KabiVitrum, Alameda, California) with heparin was infused to raise serum fatty acids to an average of 0.95 +/- 0.08 mumol/ml, whereas in the five remaining nonsupplemented group 3 hearts, serum levels of fatty acids were 0.49 +/- 0.10 mumol/ml. Ischemia in supplemented and nonsupplemented hearts caused a decline in regional mechanical performance (-40 delta % and -39 delta % below aerobic values in active shortening) that failed to recover completely (-16 delta % and -25 delta % below aerobic values in active shortening) during reflow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ischemia in the dog produces denervation of myocardium apical to the ischemic area. To investigate the mechanism(s) of the denervation, we tested the effects of hypoxia and some components of ischemia including high K+, low pH, and adenosine on efferent cardiac autonomic responses. In anesthetized, open-chest dogs, we occluded a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery and perfused it with hypoxic Tyrode's solutions (PO2 less than 50 mm Hg). We found that effective refractory period (ERP) shortening induced by bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation at myocardium basal and apical to the perfusing area did not change during a 20-25 minute period of perfusion with hypoxic normal Tyrode's solution. During perfusion with hypoxic combined Tyrode's solution containing 12 mM K+, pH 6.8, and 10 microM adenosine, ERP shortening at basal sites induced by bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation remained unchanged but was attenuated at apical sites (16 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 1 msec, mean +/- SEM, n = 35, p less than 0.001), and seven apical sites exhibited denervation (less than or equal to 2-msec shortening). The maximum extracellular K+ concentration of the perfusing area, measured with a K(+)-sensitive electrode, was 5.1 +/- 0.9 mM (N = 3 dogs) during perfusion with normal Tyrode's solution and was 11.8 +/- 0.1 mM (N = 3 dogs) during perfusion with hypoxic combined solution (p = 0.017). In a separate group of dogs, the effects of high K+, low pH, and adenosine in the absence of ischemia were examined. Oxygenated Tyrode's solutions were instilled into the pericardial cavity to superfuse epicardial nerves. The Tyrode's solutions containing high K+ (12 mM), low pH (6.4), or adenosine (10 microM), individually or combined, reduced ERP shortening induced by bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation in the ventricular intramyocardium to 46%, 55%, 56%, and 33% of each control value obtained during superfusion with normal Tyrode's solution and reduced the magnitude of ERP lengthening induced by bilateral cervical vagal stimulation to 57%, 71%, 61%, and 39%, respectively. ERP responses of the test sites to infused norepinephrine and methacholine, however, remained unaffected by superfusion with combined Tyrode's solution. Thus, high K+, low pH, and adenosine each inhibit efferent sympathetic and vagal neurotransmission presynaptically in the canine heart and may contribute to the development of denervation during early ischemia.\r"

Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to continuous or intermittent ischemia. A single 5-minute period of continuous ischemia did not result in a significant decrease in the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide pool; a single 10-minute period of ischemia resulted in a decrease of approximately 17%. Next, the adenine nucleotide content of mitochondria from preischemic and 30-minute continuous ischemic hearts was compared with two groups of hearts undergoing intermittent ischemia (both groups receiving a total of 30 minutes of ischemia). One group received three 10-minute episodes of ischemia interrupted by 5-minute periods of reperfusion (3 x 10-minute intermittent ischemia); the other intermittent ischemic group received six 5-minute episodes of ischemia interrupted by 5-minute periods of perfusion (6 x 5-minute intermittent ischemia).

An elevated cholesterol level in the cells precultured with patients' sera was retained several days after the removal of the examined serum from culture. The accumulation of intracellular cholesterol was accompanied by enhanced synthesis of DNA, total protein, collagen, sulfated glycosaminoglycans, and hyaluronic acid. Enhanced DNA and total protein synthesis was retained for at least 9 days after the serum had been removed from culture. The obtained results suggest that the sera of CHD patients possess an atherogenic potential that manifests itself at the arterial cell level in the stable stimulation of atherosclerotic cellular processes: proliferation, lipidosis, and fibrosis. The examined sera of healthy donors were devoid of such an atherogenic potential. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction (density, 1.030-1.050 g/cm3) obtained from an atherogenic serum had the same atherogenic potential as a whole serum. Atherosclerotic alterations in cultured intimal cells caused by atherogenic LDL were retained for at least 3 days after the removal of the lipoprotein from culture. Preincubation of intimal cells with LDL obtained from healthy donors had no effect on the intracellular cholesterol level or the synthesis of DNA and extracellular matrix. One may assume that the atherogenic potential of CHD patients' sera is related to the presence of LDLs that are qualitatively different from the LDL of healthy subjects.\r"

The effects of endothelium removal and of local incubation with the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (ICI Pharma 209000) on the carotid compliance (CC) were compared with the effects of total abolition of the vascular smooth muscle tone by potassium cyanide. CC measured for pressures ranging from 50 to 175 mm Hg had maximal values (0.22 +/- 0.07 microliter/mm Hg and 0.13 +/- 0.03 microliter/mm Hg, respectively, for WKY and SHR, p less than 0.001) for pressure values close to the operating pressures in both groups. Maximal values of CC were increased by 35% and 45% in WKY and SHR, respectively, after potassium cyanide poisoning (p less than 0.01). The endothelium removal induced a significant increase in CC compared with their control values (+37%, p less than 0.01, and +25%, p less than 0.01, respectively, in WKY and SHR). CC measured after endothelium removal did not significantly differ from its values measured after potassium cyanide poisoning in normotensive animals. In contrast, in hypertensive animals, CC was significantly lower after endothelium, removal than after potassium cyanide poisoning (p less than 0.01). In the presence of intact endothelium, local incubation with converting enzyme inhibitor increased CC by 23% (p less than 0.05) in WKY rats and by 14% (p less than 0.01) in SHR. In contrast, after endothelium removal, converting enzyme inhibitors did not significantly increase further CC in either strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of treadmill exercise on regional myocardial blood flow and function were examined in 10 adult, conscious dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) induced by aortic banding in puppies, which resulted in a left ventricular (LV) weight/body weight ratio of 8.5 +/- 0.3. Data were compared with results from eight control dogs with an LV weight/body weight ratio of 4.9 +/- 0.2. At rest, LV systolic and end-diastolic pressures were significantly greater (p less than 0.01), and mean arterial pressure was significantly less (p less than 0.05) in LVH dogs. Mean myocardial blood flow (control dogs, 0.98 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g; LVH dogs, 1.16 +/- 0.06 ml/min/g) and the transmural blood flow distribution at baseline, as assessed by endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio (control, 1.35 +/- 0.12; LVH, 1.21 +/- 0.09), were similar in the two groups. During exercise to a target heart rate (240 beats/min), LVH dogs demonstrated greater (p less than 0.01) increases in LV systolic and end-diastolic pressures. In control dogs, as expected, exercise augmented velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (16 +/- 9%) and shortening fraction (15 +/- 5%), but in LVH dogs, exercise reduced the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (-14 +/- 6%) and shortening fraction (-17 +/- 5%). Exercise also increased full wall thickening (35 +/- 5%), subendocardial wall thickening (66 +/- 10%), and subepicardial wall thickening (44 +/- 9%) in control dogs. In LVH dogs, exercise increased subepicardial wall thickening (31 +/- 9%) and reduced subendocardial wall thickening (-40 +/- 7%); full wall thickening did not change (-11 +/- 9%). This was associated with a fall in endocardial/epicardial flow ratio to 0.72 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.01) in LVH dogs. The subendocardial dysfunction persisted late into recovery, at a time when the transmural blood flow distribution had returned to baseline; this occurrence suggested myocardial stunning. Thus, in dogs with LVH, selective subendocardial hypoperfusion and profound selective depression in subendocardial wall thickening are observed during exercise. The subendocardial dysfunction persisted into recovery despite resolution of the perfusion abnormality.\r"

  ".U": "90124865\r", 
  ".W": "This study analyzes the importance of the source and rate of ATP production (glucose flux, glycogenolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation) in the prevention of ischemic contracture in isolated rat hearts. Ischemic contracture was initiated at about 10 minutes by buffer perfusion with nonglycolytic substrates whereas the addition of 11 mM glucose prevented contracture for 2 hours. Tissue values of ATP, phosphocreatine, and lactate could be dissociated from onset of ischemic contracture. In hearts perfused with acetate or free fatty acid, with 11 mM glucose, glycolytic ATP production was 2.3-2.8 mumol/g fresh wt/min; as initial rates of glycogenolysis fell, glycolysis was maintained by a steady increase of glucose flux to values in excess of 2 mumol ATP/g fresh wt/min. Decreasing the glucose flux by lowering the perfusate glucose or by the addition of 2-deoxyglucose precipitated ischemic contracture. When oxidative phosphorylation was further reduced by hypoxia, glucose still prevented ischemic contracture; however, when oxidative phosphorylation dropped to near zero (near-anoxic) rates, glycolysis was inhibited, and glucose could only delay ischemic contracture to about 45 minutes. Combined ATP production rates could be dissociated from contracture. The metabolic parameter that correlated best with prevention or delay of ischemic contracture was the rate of glycolytic flux from glucose, which in this model of global low-flow ischemia had to accelerate to provide a rate of ATP production from glucose in excess of 2 mumol/g fresh wt/min within 30 minutes of the start of ischemia to prevent ischemic contracture.\r"

  ".U": "90124866\r", 
  ".W": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relation between magnesium and calcium on vascular smooth muscle tone in bovine pulmonary artery and vein. Rapid removal of magnesium from Krebs-bicarbonate medium used to bathe isolated rings of precontracted artery or vein caused transient endothelium- and calcium-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation. Both responses were antagonized by oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, or superoxide anion and were enhanced by superoxide dismutase. The transient relaxation was followed by sustained endothelium-independent contraction. Endothelium-denuded vascular rings contracted in response to extracellular magnesium depletion without alteration in cyclic GMP levels. The data suggest that vascular endothelium-derived nitric oxide is responsible for the calcium-dependent relaxation elicited by extracellular magnesium depletion. Indeed, in bioassay cascade studies, magnesium removal from the medium used to perfuse intact artery or vein enhanced the formation and/or release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor by calcium-dependent mechanisms. In the absence of both extracellular magnesium and calcium, calcium readdition caused transient endothelium-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation, and both responses were abolished by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. In the presence of magnesium, however, readdition of calcium to calcium-depleted medium caused only contractile responses. Addition of magnesium to calcium-containing medium consistently caused endothelium- and cyclic GMP-independent relaxation that was not altered by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. Thus, magnesium and calcium elicit reciprocal or mutually antagonistic effects at the levels of both endothelium-derived relaxing factor formation and/or release and smooth muscle contraction. This relation may be of physiological importance, and the possibility that a reduction in circulating magnesium levels could lead to calcium-mediated vasospasm may be of pathophysiological concern.\r"

  ".W": "A computer model of a ring-shaped, one-dimensional cardiac fiber was used for examination of responses of propagation to premature stimuli applied under different degrees of both cell-to-cell coupling and membrane excitability. Results demonstrated the importance of cellular uncoupling in the genesis of unidirectional block and reentry. Propagation of excitation itself created a certain degree of functional inhomogeneity that provided necessary conditions for unidirectional block and reentry. The likelihood of induction of unidirectional block was proportional to the degree of cellular uncoupling. In contrast, uniform reduction in sodium channel conductance decreased the inducibility of unidirectional block. Nonsustained and sustained reentry was induced by a properly timed single premature stimulus during the refractory period of a propagating action potential. Reduction of the size of the reentry pathway resulted in an increased degree of interaction between the wavefront and its tail, which, in turn, changed the kinetics of the slow ionic channels, bringing about shortening of action potential duration. Alternans in action potential duration were also demonstrated during circus movement and were caused by the alternating kinetic properties of the slow ionic currents. Inhomogeneity along the reentry pathway in refractory period, in membrane excitability, in fiber cross-sectional area, or in gap junction resistance also provided conditions necessary for unidirectional block. The simulations suggested that an important role was played by cellular uncoupling in the genesis and maintenance of unidirectional block and reentry.\r"

We, therefore, examined in rabbits the effect of treatment with dexamethasone (2.5 mg/kg) for 6 days on vascular responses to pressor prostanoids in aortic and carotid arterial rings and in the isolated perfused kidney. Isometric tension development to prostaglandin F2 alpha and U46619, a thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide mimetic, was markedly reduced in vessels from dexamethasone-treated rabbits. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on vascular reactivity was manifested by an increase in the concentration of agonist for threshold tension development and a reduction in the maximal response to prostaglandin F2 alpha and U46619. In contrast, reactivity to phenylephrine, potassium, histamine, or endothelin was not affected by dexamethasone treatment. In addition, pressor responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha and U46619 in Krebs'-perfused kidneys from dexamethasone-treated rabbits were also diminished. These data suggest that dexamethasone selectively interferes with the expression of receptor-mediated contractile responses to eicosanoids.\r"

Aortic pressure and heart rate were held constant by an aortic snare and atrial pacing, respectively. Distal pressure of the left anterior descending coronary artery was controlled by a screw occluder on the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and monitored with a 24-gauge plastic cannula inserted into the branch or distal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Distal pressure of the left anterior descending coronary artery was stepwisely reduced to 59 +/- 1 mm Hg (mild stenosis, n = 20) and 38 +/- 1 mm Hg (severe stenosis, n = 16). In the left circumflex coronary artery area, myocardial blood flow measured with radioactive microspheres to subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium did not change with the mild and severe stenosis from control. In the left anterior descending coronary artery area, myocardial blood flow to each layer remained at nearly control level with the mild stenosis but was reduced in midmyocardium and subendocardium with the severe stenosis. With the mild stenosis, diameters of coronary arterial microvessels less than 100 microns in diameter dilated, and those larger than 100 microns in diameter did not change. The magnitude of vasodilation in small arterial microvessels was inversely related to control diameter. With the severe stenosis, small arterial microvessels dilated, and simultaneously, large arterial microvessels constricted. Again, the magnitude of vasodilation in small arterial microvessels was inversely related to control diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemorrhage at a constant rate (0.5 ml/kg/min) was continued until mean arterial pressure fell to 40 mm Hg or 30 ml/kg of blood was withdrawn. Hemorrhage (20 ml/kg) decreased mean arterial pressure similarly in the intact group (-15 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) and CD group (-17 +/- 3.2 mm Hg), but to a greater extent in the SAD (-53 +/- 3.4 mm Hg) and SAD + CD (-49 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) groups. Total peripheral resistance increased similarly in the intact (20.4 +/- 3.0 mm Hg/l/min) and CD (22.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg/l/min) groups, but did not increase in SAD and SAD + CD groups. Acute cardiac denervation induced with intrapericardial lidocaine in either the intact or SAD groups resulted in similar responses of mean arterial pressure to hemorrhage as those observed in the chronic CD and chronic SAD + CD groups, respectively. Thus, dogs with cardiac denervation withstand hemorrhage and increase total peripheral resistance to a similar extent as intact dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 60% of adult canine Purkinje fibers respond to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation with a decrease in automaticity. Recent studies of disaggregated Purkinje myocytes have suggested that this negative chronotropic effect results from alpha 1-adrenergic activation of the Na-K pump. In this study we evaluated 1) whether Na-K pump activation is associated with the negative chronotropic effect of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in adult canine Purkinje fibers and 2) if the effect of alpha-agonists on the pump is direct or mediated by an increase in intracellular sodium activity (aNai). We used sodium selective microelectrodes to determine the effects of 5 x 10(-9) and 5 x 10(-8) M phenylephrine on aNai. Phenylephrine decreased automaticity in five of eight Purkinje fibers while an increase occurred in the other three. The rate decrease was always accompanied by a decrease in aNai (-3.9 mM; p less than 0.05), whereas in fibers showing an increase in rate, aNai was unchanged. To evaluate the effect of phenylephrine in the absence of changes in automaticity, 10 Purkinje fibers were studied during pacing. A clear-cut reduction in aNai (-2.8 mM) was present in six fibers; no change was seen in the other four. The effect of phenylephrine was blocked by prazosin but not by propranolol. We conclude that the effect of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation to reduce aNai is consistent with activation of the Na-K pump. Moreover, this action of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation is closely linked to its negative chronotropic effect.\r"

  ".W": "We created an animal model to understand better the pathogenesis and underlying mechanism of progressive central pulmonary venous (PV) obstruction, a condition not amenable to current therapy. Twenty piglets underwent banding of their PVs, 18 had a sham operation, and 12 were nonoperated controls. After 1, 3, and 6 weeks hemodynamic data were obtained and correlated with ventricular weights, PV and pulmonary artery (PA) distensibilities (at 1 week), morphometric structural and ultrastructural analyses, and biochemical assessment of elastin determined gravimetrically (and by desmosine level at 1 week), collagen, and elastase activity. At 1 week, PV banding was associated with increased PV compliance (p less than 0.05). At 3 weeks, an increased PA pressure (Ppa) (p less than 0.05) was observed, unaccompanied by a rise in PV pressure (Pcw). In the PV, however, there was breakdown of the internal elastic lamina with apparent migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelium. At 6 weeks, a rise in Pcw (p less than 0.01), a further rise in Ppa (p less than 0.01), and right ventricular hypertrophy (p less than 0.005) were observed. We also observed mild PV intimal thickening (p less than 0.01), complete degradation of elastic laminae (p less than 0.05), and an increase in collagen assessed morphometrically (p less than 0.01). The banding procedure resulted in an overall increase in PV elastin synthesis and in the proportion of elastin determined gravimetrically (p less than 0.05 for both) but not by desmosine level, suggesting the possibility of poor cross-linking of elastin, which might account for the early increased distensibility of the PV. However, our assay could not detect an increase in elastase activity associated with either the increased distensibility or the ultrastructural changes of elastin degradation. The increased Ppa was not associated with significant PA biochemical or structural changes. We speculate that in response to distal venous obstruction, early remodeling of the PVs increases distensibility, protecting the lung from venous congestion and blunting a rise in Pcw. PA hypertension precedes the rise in Pcw, likely because of reflex vasoconstriction. The subsequent modest rise in Pcw is already associated with extensive fibrosis of the PV, suggesting a reason for unsuccessful current therapy and a need for consideration of earlier assessment and intervention.\r"

The effect of an increase in oxygen consumption elicited by either beta-adrenergic stimulation or an increase in contraction frequency on interstitial fluid and coronary effluent ADO levels was investigated in isolated perfused isovolumically contracting rat hearts. ADO in left ventricular surface transudates and coronary effluents was rendered fluorescent with chloroacetaldehyde, and the formed ethenoadenosine derivative was quantitated with high-performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection. Heart preparation integrity was verified by determining the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and ADO deaminase in the transudates. Isoproterenol (10(-8) M) elicited a 45% increase in oxygen consumption and a 54% increase in developed left ventricular pressure in hearts paced at 240 beats/min. With isoproterenol the control transudate ADO concentration (304 pmol/ml) increased 493%, and the control effluent ADO concentration (48 pmol/ml) increased 259%. Increasing the contraction frequency from 180 to 300 beats/min in the presence of 10(-6) M propranolol increased oxygen consumption by 45% and decreased left ventricular pressure by 29%. With the increase in contraction frequency, the transudate ADO concentration did not increase significantly. However, the ADO concentration in the effluent was an average of 269% greater in hearts contracting at the higher frequency. Increasing the contraction frequency of hearts treated with both 10(-6) M propranolol and 10(-5) M atropine also had no significant effect on the level of transudate ADO. The effluent level of ADO increased only 78%. Levels of ADO in transudates were not significantly affected by mesothelial cell metabolism. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic stimulation the interstitial level of ADO in the heart increases to levels that are sufficient to manifest its antiadrenergic effects. Furthermore, there is not always a correlation between the levels of ADO found in the interstitial and effluent fluid compartments.\r"

The present study was designed to examine electrophysiological properties of single cardiac myocytes enzymatically isolated from the endocardial and epicardial surfaces of the cat left ventricle and to determine whether the differential responses to ischemia of intact tissue occur in single cells. Action potentials recorded from the isolated single cells of epicardial surface had lower action potential amplitude and a prominent notch between phase 1 and phase 2, compared with those of the cells isolated from the endocardial surface; these findings are similar to those in intact endocardial and epicardial preparations. Resting membrane potentials recorded from both endocardial and epicardial single cells were sensitive to the change in extracellular K+ concentration and had properties of a K+ electrode. Action potential duration was frequency dependent in both cell types and was shorter in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells at a stimulation rate of 3 Hz. When the cells were superfused with Tyrode's solution that was altered to mimic an ischemic environment in vivo (PO2, 30-40 mm Hg; pH 6.8; [K+], 10 mM; and glucose free), resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, and action potential duration were reduced, and the refractory period was shortened in both endocardial and epicardial single cells, but there were no differences in the degree of changes in action potentials and refractory periods induced between the two cell types. Action potential changes induced by L-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine (5-40 mg/l) were also similar in endocardial and epicardial single cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For this purpose, we directly measured internal diameters and red blood cell velocities in arterial and venous coronary microvessels during long diastoles under maximal vasodilation. The epicardial coronary microcirculation was viewed in anesthetized, open-chest mongrel dogs through an intravital microscope equipped with a newly developed floating objective. Coronary microvascular diameters and red blood cell velocities were measured with high-speed cinematography. During maximal vasodilation (150 micrograms/kg body wt i.v. dilazep), long diastoles were induced by vagal nerve stimulation. Internal diameters of all small arteries and arterioles (n = 12) gradually declined with decreasing aortic pressure during long diastoles, and the reduction of the diameter was greatest when aortic pressure was less than 35 mm Hg. The mean internal diameter (88.8 +/- 52.2 microns) at minimal aortic pressure (19.2 +/- 6.4 mm Hg) was significantly less than that at an aortic pressure of 100 mm Hg (116.2 +/- 68.5 microns, p less than 0.01). The internal diameters of small veins and venules remained nearly constant during long diastoles. When red blood cell progression in coronary microvessels stopped at the nadir of aortic pressure, all arterial coronary microvessels remained open; that is, there was no evidence of \"critical closure.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Normally, cardiac mast cell density in 11-12-day-old animals is very low, but increases markedly in the following 2-3 weeks to its highest values, with a subsequent decline toward adult values. At the peak of mast cell density, the percentage of mast cells in close proximity to capillaries is also highest. In adult animals, mast cell counts are significantly higher in the right ventricle than in the left. This relation is preserved even when the right ventricle is hypertrophic, as in rats born at simulated high altitude. Chronic hypertension and swimming have little effect on the mast cell density in rat hearts. Conspicuous changes in the mast cell density at the time of capillary proliferation seem to indicate a special role played by these cells in the formation of new vessels.\r"

Capillaries were cannulated in situ and perfused with frog Ringer's solution containing 10 mg/ml albumin and human erythrocytes while the mesentery was continuously superfused with frog Ringer's solution (15 degrees C). Lp was first measured under normoxic (room air equilibrated) conditions by the modified Landis microocclusion method. Repeated measurements of filtration coefficient under control conditions, for periods up to 80 minutes, demonstrated that Lp did not change with time in normoxic vessels (n = 18). After initial control measurement (Lpo), perfusion with 1 microM acetylcholine increased Lp by 4.6 +/- 1.0-fold (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). The response to acetylcholine was antagonized by the addition of 10 microns atropine to the perfusate (Lp/Lpo = 1.8 +/- 0.4). Perfusion with atropine alone reduced Lp in three of six capillaries Lp/Lpo = 0.56 +/- 0.04); Lp in the remaining three vessels was unaffected. Tissue hypoxia was simulated by exposing the mesentery to deoxygenated superfusate Po2 less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) for 10-15 minutes. Tissue hypoxia had no effect on Lp in atropine-treated vessels (n = 8). Without atropine, tissue hypoxia increased Lp by 2.3 +/- 0.7-fold, whereas the addition of atropine completely antagonized this response (n = 5). In contrast to the inhibitory action of atropine during tissue hypoxia, Lp rose 5.2 +/- 1.6-fold (n = 4) in vessels simultaneously exposed to deoxygenated perfusate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Supernormality, which can be defined as greater than normal excitability during or immediately after action potential repolarization, has been observed in a variety of cardiac preparations. However, as yet, no description of the dynamics of tissue response to repetitive stimulation in the presence of supernormal or relatively supernormal excitability has appeared. Isolated sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers (2-5 mm in length) were superfused with Tyrode's solution and stimulated with depolarizing current pulses through a suction pipette. Recovery of excitability, restitution of the action potential duration, and response patterns were measured in each fiber for a wide range of current amplitudes and stimulation frequencies. When the potassium chloride concentration of the Tyrode's solution was decreased from 7 to 4 mM, the excitability recovery function consistently changed from monophasic (\"normal\") to triphasic (\"supernormal'). During repetitive stimulation at increasing rates, normal preparations responded only with gradual changes in the activation ratio, expressed as periodic phase-locked responses (i.e., Wenckebach-like patterns, etc.). Supernormal preparations showed a nonmonotonic change in the activation ratio, as well as complex aperiodic response patterns. Numerical results from an analytical model gave a quantitative basis for the relation between nonmonotonicity in the excitability function and the development of complex rhythms in cardiac Purkinje fibers. Both our experimental and theoretical results indicate that the presence of supernormality and the slope of the action potential duration restitution curve at short diastolic intervals are responsible for the development of chaotic dynamics. Moreover, our results give an accurate description of the supernormality phenomenon, predict the behavior expected under such conditions, and provide insight about the role of membrane recovery in determining regular and irregular frequency-dependent rhythm and conduction disturbances.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in energy substrate utilization during reperfusion of ischemic hearts can influence the functional recovery of the myocardium. Energy substrate preference by the reperfused myocardium, however, has received limited attention. Therefore, we measured oxidation rates of glucose and palmitate during reperfusion of ischemic hearts. Isolated working rat hearts were perfused with 1.2 mM palmitate and 11 mM [14C]glucose, 1.2 mM [14C]palmitate and 11 mM glucose, or 11 mM [14C]glucose alone, at an 11.5 mm Hg preload and 80 mm Hg afterload. Hearts were subjected to 60-minute aerobic perfusion or 25-minute global ischemia followed by 60-minute aerobic reperfusion. Steady-state oxidative rates of glucose or palmitate were determined by measuring 14CO2 production. In hearts perfused with glucose alone, oxidative rates during reperfusion were not significantly different than nonischemic hearts (1,008 +/- 335 vs. 1,372 +/- 117 nmol [14C]glucose oxidized/min/g dry wt, respectively). In the presence of palmitate, glucose oxidation was markedly reduced in reperfused and nonischemic hearts (81 +/- 11 and 101 +/- 15 nmol [14C]glucose oxidized/min/g dry wt, respectively). Palmitate oxidation rates were not significantly different in reperfused compared with nonischemic hearts (369 +/- 55 and 455 +/- 50 nmol [14C]palmitate oxidized/min/g dry wt, respectively). [14C]Palmitate was incorporated into myocardial triglycerides to a greater extent in reperfused ischemic hearts than in nonischemic hearts (26.0 and 13.8 mumol/g dry wt, respectively). Under the perfusion conditions used, palmitate provided over 90% of the ATP produced from exogenous substrates. Addition of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, ethyl 2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (Etomoxir, 10(-6) M), during reperfusion stimulated glucose oxidation and improved mechanical recovery of ischemic hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The reduction in Ca2+ concentration during diastole and relaxation occurs differently in normal hearts and in hypertrophied hearts secondary to pressure overload. We have studied some possible molecular mechanisms underlying these differences by examining the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the expression of the gene encoding its Ca2(+)-ATPase in rat hearts with mild and severe compensatory hypertrophy induced by abdominal aortic constriction. Twelve sham-operated rats and 31 operated rats were studied 1 month after surgery. Eighteen animals exhibited mild hypertrophy (left ventricular wt/body wt less than 2.6) and 13 animals severe hypertrophy (left ventricular wt/body wt greater than 2.6). During hypertrophy we observed a decline in the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum as assessed by the oxalate-stimulated Ca2+ uptake of homogenates of the left ventricle. Values decreased from 12.1 +/- 1.2 nmol Ca2+/mg protein/min in sham-operated rats to 9.1 +/- 1.5 and 6.7 +/- 1.1 in rats with mild and severe hypertrophy, respectively (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively, vs. shams). This decrease was accompanied by a parallel reduction in the number of functionally active CA2(+)-ATPase molecules, as determined by the level of Ca2(+)-dependent phosphorylated intermediate: 58.8 +/- 7.4 and 48.1 +/- 13.5 pmol P/mg protein in mild and severe hypertrophy, respectively, compared with 69.7 +/- 8.2 in shams (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively, vs. shams). Using S1 nuclease mapping, we observed that the Ca2(+)-ATPase messenger RNA (mRNA) from sham-operated and hypertrophied hearts was identical. Finally, the relative level of expression of the Ca2(+)-ATPase gene was studied by dot blot analysis at both the mRNA and protein levels using complementary DNA clones and a monoclonal antibody specific to the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase. In mild hypertrophy, the concentrations of Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA and protein in the left ventricle were unchanged when compared with shams (mRNA, 93.8 +/- 10.6% vs. sham, NS; protein, 105.5 +/- 14% vs. sham, NS). in severe hypertrophy, the concentration of Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA decreased to 68.7 +/- 12.9% and that of protein to 80.1 +/- 15.5% (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively), whereas the total amount of mRNA and enzyme per left ventricle was either unchanged or slightly increased. The slow velocity of relaxation of severely hypertrophied heart can be at least partially explained by the absence of an increase in the expression of the Ca2(+)-ATPase gene and by the relative diminution in the density of the Ca2+ pumps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In guinea pig cardiac myocytes quinidine (20 microM) caused less than 10% tonic block reduction of the sodium current at -120 mV, but a fast pulse train reduced it more than 90%. Recovery from use-dependent block was time and voltage dependent, and was always slow (tau = 34 +/- 10 seconds at -160 mV; tau = 90 +/- 35 seconds at -120 mV; n = 15, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.001, paired t test). However, in association with repeated activation a fast component of recovery from block was observed: use-dependent unblocking. Availability of sodium channels for use-dependent unblocking was enhanced by hyperpolarization until a plateau was reached near -160 mV. Compared with the availability of drug-free sodium channels (h-curve), the voltage dependence of availability for use-dependent unblocking (h'-curve) was shifted by about 30 mV to more negative potentials, and its slope was reduced 2.5-fold. At -160 mV, the kinetics of development of availability of sodium channels for use-dependent unblocking were rapid (tau less than 10 msec). Depolarization to -120 mV reduced the availability of sodium channels for fast unblocking with a time constant of 191 +/- 46 msec (n = 14). Finally, block established by frequent brief depolarizations (activations) declined during prolonged inactivation. From these results we concluded that the time and voltage dependence of the availability of sodium channels for unblocking are considerably different from the availability for activation of drug-free channels, that rested drug-associated channels do exist, and that drug-associated channels do not conduct (or at least have a greatly reduced conductance) upon activation unless they first unblock. Furthermore, activated and inactivated channels have a different affinity for quinidine, and since quinidine can occupy the channel receptor even when \"guarded,\" our results are incompatible with the guarded receptor hypothesis but can be explained within the framework of the modulated receptor hypothesis.\r"

All experiments were performed in the presence of propranolol (1 mumol/l) and LiCl (10 mmol/l). Products measured after separation with high-performance liquid chromatography were inositol 1-phosphate (1-IP1), inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (1,4-IP2), inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (1,3,4,-IP3), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3), and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (1,3,4,5-IP4). All inositol phosphates increased after stimulation with phenylephrine. 1,4,5-IP3 was the first compound to rise maximally within 30 seconds; this rise was followed by an increase in 1,3,4,5-IP4 and 1,4-IP2 beginning within 2 minutes. The increase in 1,3,4-IP3 and 1-IP1 was slower and did not reach steady state within 15 minutes. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine was maximal after 5 minutes. It is concluded that the increase in the presumed second messengers 1,4,5-IP3 and 1,3,4,5-IP4 coincides with the positive inotropic effect after alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Since the increase in 1,4,5-IP3 precedes the increase in force of contraction, 1,4,5-IP3 may initiate the positive inotropic effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists and 1,3,4,5-IP4 maintains the increase in force of contraction.\r"

  ".W": "A large atrial contribution to left ventricular (LV) filling (%A) in patients with LV hypertrophy has been assumed by some to indicate abnormal LV compliance. We tested this assumption by examining the influence of short- and long-term changes in load on compliance and filling dynamics using nitroprusside to decrease load in 11 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and ergonovine to increase load in nine normal subjects. LV angiographic volume was analyzed frame-by-frame simultaneous with micromanometer pressure recordings. Operative LV chamber compliance (dV/VdP) and a time constant for isovolumic relaxation rate were computed using three-constant exponential equations fit to the data. Compared with normal subjects, resting left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased and dV/VdP was reduced in AS, but %A was not different. %A was inversely related to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = -0.48, p = 0.02) and positively correlated with dV/VdP (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001) within the AS group. Nitroprusside infusion reduced LV peak systolic pressure by 11%, end-diastolic pressure by 38%, and end-diastolic volume by 12% (p less than or equal to 0.004 for each) and tended to increase dV/VdP by 26% (p = 0.23). These alterations in load resulted in a 21% decrease (-16 ml) in the early filling volume (p less than 0.05) and variable increases (mean, +7 ml; p = NS) in the late atrial filling volume and in the percent atrial contribution to ventricular filling (26 +/- 19% to 35 +/- 25% for the AS group, p = NS) that were related to changes in compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although increased blood viscosity occurs in several cardiovascular diseases, little is known of factors influencing blood rheology in normal adults. Accordingly, we examined the relations of whole blood viscosity (WBV) to its rheologic determinants (hematocrit level, plasma viscosity, protein concentration, and red cell aggregability and rigidity), to demographic and laboratory variables, and to cardiovascular risk factors in 128 normotensive employed adults. Hematocrit levels accounted for 67-84% of variability of WBV at shear rates from 208 to 0.1 sec-1 with lesser contributions from plasma viscosity, red cell aggregability, and rigidity (multiple r = 0.95-0.97); WBV was predicted accurately from standard measurements of hematocrit and total plasma protein levels (multiple r = 0.78-0.92 in \"learning\" and \"test\" analysis). Male sex, obesity, dietary Na+ intake, and increasing age had additive effects on WBV (multiple r greater than or equal to 0.59, p less than 0.00001); the last three of these factors and black race independently predicted plasma viscosity (multiple r = 0.36, p less than 0.001). Among regulators of plasma volume, plasma renin activity and urinary Na+ excretion bore independent positive relations to WBV. Diastolic and mean blood pressures were independent predictors of WBV and hematocrit levels (all p less than 0.05). Conventional risk factors (e.g., triglycerides, obesity, and cholesterol levels) were positively related to WBV or plasma viscosity. Thus, in apparently normal adults, 1) WBV or plasma viscosity are increased by male sex, obesity, high sodium intake, aging, and black race, 2) WBV is positively related to plasma renin activity, 3) WBV or plasma viscosity are related to diastolic and mean blood pressures, triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations, and 4) WBV can be predicted from simple measurements of hematocrit and total plasma protein levels.\r"

Eight patients remained palliated throughout the 3-year period; neither the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (153 +/- 15% of normal vs. 157 +/- 19%, p = NS) nor a load-independent index of contractility (rate-corrected velocity of shortening [VCFc]/end-systolic meridional stress [ESSM]) changed. Eleven patients underwent a Fontan operation during the study and were reevaluated at least 6 months after surgery; left ventricular dimension decreased (130 +/- 15% vs. 114 +/- 19%, p less than 0.001), and the contractility index VCFc/ESSM improved (p less than 0.05). Fourteen patients had undergone a Fontan operation 0.9-9.5 years (mean, 4.2 years) before initial examination in 1985. Over the 3-year period, left ventricular dimensions did not change (121 +/- 17% vs. 118 +/- 11%, p = NS), but the contractility index showed significant improvement (p less than 0.01). Eight additional patients were studied just before and after a Fontan operation to examine the early effects of surgery. Left ventricular dimensions decreased from 130 +/- 14% to 100 +/- 13% by 10 days p less than 0.001) with no further change at 2 months. An inappropriate degree of ventricular hypertrophy was observed in only the early postoperative period. Successful Fontan repair results in rapid reduction of left ventricular size, followed by regression of hypertrophy to a normal mass-to-volume ratio. Operating at more favorable dimensions and loading conditions results in an early increase in left ventricular contractility, which further improves in the medium term follow-up.\r"

Late arrhythmic deaths after successful procedures have been reported; however, the magnitude remains unknown. This study was undertaken to identify the magnitude of late sudden death and the significant factors associated with it. From 1965 through 1985, 118 patients underwent corrective operation for double-outlet right ventricle; of these, 23 died in the hospital and six were lost to follow-up. The 89 remaining patients (52 male and 37 female) made up the study population. Their mean age (+/- SD) was 10.3 +/- 7.8 years at the time of repair. The mean duration of follow-up was 82 months. Of the 22 late deaths, 16 (73%) were sudden. Eight (50%) of the sudden deaths occurred within 1 year of operation. Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis revealed the following significant risk factors for late sudden death: older age at the time of operation, perioperative or postoperative ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and third-degree atrioventricular block. Factors not associated with late sudden death included year of operation, sex, type and number of associated cardiac anomalies, preoperative functional class, previous palliative procedures, surgical technique, perioperative or postoperative single premature ventricular contractions, and postoperative left or right bundle branch block with or without fascicular block. We conclude that the incidence of late sudden death after successful surgical repair of double-outlet right ventricle is very high. Complete corrective operation at an early age and aggressive diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and conduction defects after operation are warranted.\r"

Diagnoses were made by pediatric cardiologists' clinical evaluations, echocardiography, catheterization, surgery, or autopsy. During this study period, 2,509 of 379,561 liveborn infants were diagnosed, a prevalence rate of 6.6/1000. The rates for whites was significantly higher than for blacks or Mexican-Americans--7.2/1,000, 5.6/1,000, and 5.9/1,000, respectively. The rate for severe cases requiring cardiac catheterization or surgery or undergoing autopsy was 3.1/1,000 and did not differ among the three groups. The time trend for rates of congenital heart disease suggested an apparent increase in prevalence rate during the 1970s; however, the prevalence rate of severe forms remained relatively stable. This indicates that the apparent rise in prevalence could be accounted for by an increase in detection of mild cases. These findings were interpreted as reflecting a greater tendency for pediatricians to refer asymptomatic children with significant heart murmurs to a pediatric cardiologist.\r"

QT, RR, and QTc intervals (by Bazett's method) were evaluated at rest and at 3 minutes of exercise in both groups. At rest, there was no significant difference in the QT interval (410 +/- 13 vs. 386 +/- 11 msec), RR interval (890 +/- 56 vs. 781 +/- 43 msec), or corrected QT interval (438 +/- 10 vs. 438 +/- 4 msec) in the case patients and the control patients. Both groups demonstrated a similar chronotropic response to exercise. The QT interval shortened in both groups with exercise (p less than 0.001), but the degree of shortening tended to be greater in the control patients (to 310 +/- 9 msec) than in the case patients (to 357 +/- 11 msec) (p = 0.06). Thus, there was a paradoxical increase in the QTc interval in the patients who experienced a proarrhythmic effect of type Ia drugs but not in the control patients (to 482 +/- 8 vs. 431 +/- 5 msec; p less than 0.001). Ten of 11 case patients but only one of 11 control patients had an increase in QTc interval of more than 10 msec with exercise (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 12 patients (aged 64 +/- 10 years) with femoropopliteal occlusions (1-27 cm; average, 8.4 cm length) that could not be recanalized by standard guidewire-balloon angioplasty techniques, percutaneous laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was performed by use of a new fluorescence-guided dual-laser system. Plaque detection by 325-nm laser-excited fluorescence spectroscopy provided real-time feedback control to a 480-nm pulsed dye laser (2-microseconds pulses) for atheroma ablation. By means of a common 200-microns optical fiber, after diagnostic fluorescence sensing, computer algorithms directed a fire or no-fire signal (5 Hz) to the treatment laser for selective plaque removal. Laser recanalization (15-50 mJ/pulse) was successful in 10 of 12 patients; this procedure was followed by definitive balloon angioplasty in seven of 12 patients with increased ankle/arm indexes (from 0.60 +/- 0.12 at baseline to 0.84 +/- 0.11 after treatment, p = 0.0043). In laser and balloon angioplasty failures, all femoropopliteal occlusions were heavily calcified, and there were two mechanical guidewire perforations without clinical sequelae. Ablation of calcified lesions required higher pulse energies and greater total energy per centimeter of recanalized tissue (1,837 +/- 1,251 mJ/cm vs. 90 +/- 39 mJ/cm, p = 0.0036). Fluorescence spectroscopy (n = 219 sites) was helpful in flush occlusions and correctly identified plaque, underlying media, and thrombus by changes in fluorescence intensity, shape, and peak position. Thus, when fluorescence-guided laser angioplasty was used in a subgroup of patients refractory to standard angioplasty techniques, primary recanalization and subsequent balloon angioplasty of femoropopliteal occlusions was successful in 83% and 58% of the patients, respectively. Importantly, treatment of heavily calcified lesions accounted for all of the failures and will require modified delivery systems to create larger primary channels and to increase catheter-tip control, which should improve clinical results in the future.\r"

Recent evidence in experimental models has suggested involvement of the complement system in microvascular and macrovascular injury subsequent to AMI. With respect to angina pectoris, whether or not the complement system is activated is not clear. The present study assessed the role of complement as a mediator of myocardial inflammation by quantifying products of complement activation, including C3d, C4d, Bb, and SC5b-9 complexes, in 31 patients with AMI, 17 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 19 patients with stable angina pectoris, and 20 normal volunteers. The plasma C3d levels increased in patients with AMI and in those with unstable angina pectoris (p less than 0.01). The plasma levels of C4d, Bb, and SC5b-9 increased only in patients with AMI (p less than 0.01). The plasma SC5b-9 level was related to peak creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.71) and inversely related to the ejection fraction (r = -0.71). The plasma SC5b-9 level of patients with congestive heart failure was higher than that of patients without congestive heart failure in AMI. These results show that activation of complement system occurs after AMI and show an association of myocardial damage with complement activation. With respect to angina pectoris, the complement system is mildly activated in patients with unstable angina pectoris; however, the cardiac function of patients with unstable angina pectoris is not damaged. The complement system of patients with stable angina pectoris is not activated.\r"

To establish its origin, an intracoronary infusion of increasing adenosine concentrations was given in 22 patients with stable angina pectoris. During adenosine infusion, 20 patients had chest pain without electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. They all reported that the chest pain was similar to their usual anginal pain. In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors. Aminophylline decreased the severity of adenosine-induced chest pain (assessed with a visual analog scale) from 42 +/- 22 to 23 +/- 17 mm (p less than 0.002). In the remaining five of the 22 patients, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the coronary sinus during intracoronary adenosine administration showed that maximum coronary vasodilation was achieved at doses lower than those responsible for chest pain. A single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effect of aminophylline on exercise-induced chest pain was also performed in 20 other patients with stable angina. Aminophylline, compared with placebo, decreased the severity of chest pain at peak exercise from 67 +/- 21 to 51 +/- 23 mm (p less than 0.02), despite the achievement of a similar degree of ST-segment depression. Finally, the effect of intravenous adenosine was compared in 10 patients with predominantly painful myocardial ischemia and in 10 patients with predominantly silent ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were 11 BHT men (age, 24.6 +/- 1.2 years) and 10 NT men (age, 23.5 +/- 1.0 years). Subjects were studied while on both low potassium, high sodium (30 meq/day, 400 meq/day) diets and high potassium, high sodium (100 meq/day, 400 meq/day) diets, each taken for 6 days. During the low potassium diet, daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure increased in both NT (123 +/- 5 mm Hg, low potassium, vs. 116 +/- 4 mm Hg, high potassium, p less than 0.01) and BHT groups (134 +/- 3, low potassium, vs. 124 +/- 3, high potassium, p less than 0.001). Mean blood pressure was not different in NT during the two diets but was significantly higher during the low potassium diet in BHT subjects (97 +/- 2 mm Hg low potassium, vs. 92 +/- 1 mm Hg, high potassium, p less than 0.05) without change in heart rate in BHT subjects during the two diets. Low potassium diet increased the postural rise in diastolic blood pressure when subjects changed from the supine position to quiet standing (standing diastolic blood pressure for NT: low potassium, 79 +/- 2 mm Hg vs. high potassium, 72 +/- 2 mm Hg; for BHT: low potassium, 89 +/- 2 mm Hg vs. high potassium diet, 83 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). The effects of low potassium diet on blood pressure were not related to marked changes in renal hemodynamics, in plasma renin activity, in aldosterone, or in norepinephrine, nor to increases in forearm vascular resistance or in muscle sympathetic nerve activity. In fact, muscle sympathetic nerve activity decreased in the BHT group during low potassium compared with high potassium diets (p less than 0.001) and did not change in the NT group. Sympathetic nerve activity was also higher in BHT compared with the NT group during high potassium and low potassium diets, p less than 0.001. In the NT group, the low potassium diet was associated with lower hematocrit levels, weight gain, and increased 24 hour urinary calcium levels. After the low potassium diet, serum potassium fell in both groups, and serum phosphorus fell significantly in the BHT group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

As a result, many clinicians administer the two agents together in an attempt to augment their effects. Although this approach seems rational, it has never been proven effective. We evaluated the cardiovascular and hyperglycemic actions of epinephrine (10 and 30 ng/kg/min), with and without calcium chloride administration (10 mg/kg bolus followed by 2 mg/kg/hr infusion), in a prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover designed study. Twelve adult patients were studied 1 day after aortocoronary bypass surgery. Calcium chloride raised ionized calcium levels from 1.06 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SEM) to 1.44 +/- 0.05 mM (p less than 0.05). Calcium raised mean arterial pressure from 85 +/- 1 to 94 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) but had no significant effect on cardiac index. Epinephrine alone at 10 and 30 ng/kg/min significantly raised cardiac index from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.0 +/- 0.2 (p less than 0.05) and 3.6 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) l/min/m2. After calcium, epinephrine failed to significantly increase cardiac index. Epinephrine at 30 ng/kg/min significantly increased mean arterial pressure from 87 +/- 1 to 95 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). After calcium, epinephrine had no significant effect on blood pressure. In addition, epinephrine's hyperglycemic effect was blunted by calcium. Plasma epinephrine levels were similar during control and calcium infusions. We conclude that calcium blunts epinephrine's beta-adrenergic actions in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.\r"

To determine whether the conversion from a normal to an abnormal ST segment response might identify individuals at high risk for a future coronary event, we analyzed the results of serial exercise tests performed at 2-4-year intervals in 726 male and female volunteers, aged 22-84 years (mean, 55.1 years), from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). All subjects were free of cardiovascular disease at entry by history, physical examination, and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram. Over a mean overall follow-up of 7.4 years, coronary events occurred in 34 of 178 (19.1%) of those with an abnormal ST response to exercise versus 30 of 548 (5.5%) in those with a normal response (p = 0.001). Angina pectoris was the most common presenting coronary event regardless of ST segment exercise response. Among individuals with an abnormal ST segment response, the incidence of events was virtually identical between those with an initially abnormal response (group 1) and those who converted from a normal to an abnormal response (group 2), 19.8% versus 18.5%. After adjustment for standard coronary risk factors by proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of a coronary event relative to subjects with persistently normal ST segment responses (group 3) remained nearly identical in the two groups, 2.72 in group 1 (p less than 0.003) and 2.80 in group 2 (p less than 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the relation between occurrence of myocardial oxidative stress and functional recovery during postischemic reperfusion in 20 selected patients subjected to aortocoronary bypass grafting. Patients were selected for having normal percent ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure before the operation. Occurrence of oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the formation and release of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in the coronary sinus immediately before aortic cross-clamp, 1, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after removal of aortic cross-clamp, and 10 and 20 minutes after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Reduced glutathione (GSH), lactate, and creatine phosphokinase release were also monitored with the same timing. Standard hemodynamic measurements were recorded by means of a triple-lumen thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter before sternotomy, 15 minutes after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, and during the 24 hours after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Reperfusion in patients after a short period of ischemia (less than 30 minutes; group 1) resulted in a small and transient release in the coronary sinus of GSSG and GSH and in a progressive improvement of hemodynamic parameters reaching a stable state 4 hours after the operation. In patients with a period of ischemia longer than 30 minutes (group 2), reperfusion induced a marked and sustained release of lactate, GSH, and GSSG; the arteriocoronary sinus difference for GSSG was still negative after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. The arteriocoronary sinus difference for creatine phosphokinase also remained negative for as long as 20 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass, and the rate of functional recovery was significantly delayed, reaching the values of group 1 only 12 hours after the operation. In these patients there was a positive correlation (r = 0.88, p less than 0.01) between the duration of ischemia and the myocardial arteriovenous difference for GSSG. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the arteriocoronary sinus difference for GSSG and cardiac index measured 2, 4, and 6 hours after the operation. These data suggest for the first time that, depending on the severity of the ischemic period, oxidative stress occurs during reperfusion of patients with coronary artery disease who are subjected to heart surgery and that it may be linked with a delay in postoperative recovery of cardiac function.\r"

Evidence of platelet involvement in these syndromes includes increased thromboxane A2 synthesis during ischemic events and enhanced in vitro sensitivity to agonists. To determine the density and affinity of platelet thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptors in patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris, the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) per platelet and the dissociation constant (Kd) of the TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist, [125I]-PTA-OH, was determined at equilibrium in washed platelets. Patients with acute myocardial infarction had a significantly (p = 0.006) higher Bmax (4,468 +/- 672 sites/platelet, n = 9) compared with controls (2,206 +/- 203 sites/platelet, n = 8). Restudied at a time when the patients' coronary artery disease was clinically stable, Bmax values for the myocardial infarction group had returned to within normal limits. The dissociation constant for [125I]-PTA-OH was not significantly different in the acute myocardial infarction patients compared with controls. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, the duration of chest pain was positively correlated (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02) with the number of [125I]-PTA-OH binding sites (Bmax). In vitro platelet sensitivity to the TXA2/PGH2 mimetic, U46619, was assessed in aggregation studies. The maximal velocity of aggregation (slope) correlated with platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor number (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001) and was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) in the acute myocardial infarction patients compared with the other study groups.

Intravenous injection of heparin (200 units/kg) failed to prevent occlusion within 60 minutes in all 10 rabbits, whereas intravenous argatroban infusion at a rate of 100 or 200 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes, which prolonged the thrombin time more than fourfold, prevented thrombosis in nine of 13 rabbits (p = 0.002 vs. i.v. heparin). Intra-arterial infusion of 200 units/kg heparin over 60 minutes prevented occlusion in six of nine rabbits (p = 0.003 vs. i.v. heparin), whereas intra-arterial argatroban at a rate of 100 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes prevented thrombosis in all 10 rabbits (p = 0.00001 vs. i.v. heparin). Patency of femoral arterial segments was maintained after the end of the intra-arterial heparin and intravenous or intra-arterial argatroban infusion for up to 3 hours despite normalization of the thrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Pathologic examination of the graft revealed that the inverted adventitial surface was covered by layers of platelets without platelet aggregation or fibrin deposition. These findings indicate that thrombin plays an important role in platelet-rich arterial thrombosis, and that the thrombogenic stimulus is rapidly attenuated by short-term infusion of the synthetic thrombin inhibitor. Selective thrombin inhibition can constitute an alternative approach to the prevention of arterial occlusion after angioplasty or thrombolytic therapy in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.\r"

There were no significant differences between groups in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, rate-pressure product, or LCCA blood flow that could account for a reduced infarct size. Regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) was determined with 15-microns radiolabeled microspheres. Transmural blood flows (ml/min/g) within the region of myocardium at risk were not statistically different between treatment groups. Infarct size in both groups was related to regional myocardial blood flow, and the relation was shifted downward in the group treated with the anti-Mo1 F(ab')2 antibody (analysis of covariance, p = 0.01). Thus, anti-Mo1 F(ab')2 produces a sustained limitation of myocardial infarct size compared with controls under similar hemodynamic conditions and a similar degree of myocardial ischemia as determined by RMBF. These data suggest that inhibition of neutrophil adhesive interactions (as suggested by the inhibitory effect of anti-Mo1 on canine neutrophil aggregation) may be an effective mechanism for protection against myocardial injury secondary to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

Accordingly, we measured coronary blood flow and reserve using radioactive microspheres in rats 4 weeks after induction of an MI by ligation of the left coronary artery. Maximal coronary dilation was induced by Carbochrome, a potent coronary vasodilator, infused at a rate of 0.45 mg/kg/min up to a total dose of 12 mg/kg. Sham-operated rats served as controls. All animals in the infarct group had a large MI affecting 30-51% (average, 41%) of the left ventricle. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly elevated (30 +/- 6.5 vs. 8.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg in sham-operated rats, p less than 0.01) and baseline hemodynamic indexes of cardiac performance were significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in this group. Myocyte cross-sectional area measurements were used as an index to quantify the degree of reactive hypertrophy and indicated that the infarcted animals had, on average, a 30% hypertrophic response of the surviving left ventricular myocardium. In the infarcted animals, both coronary flow and vasodilator reserve in the surviving myocardium were depressed. Maximal coronary blood flow in the remaining myocardium was significantly lower than that measured in the sham-operated animals (839 and 1,479 ml/min/100 g, respectively; p less than 0.001). Similarly, minimal coronary resistance was significantly higher in the MI group as compared with the sham group (0.12 vs. 0.07 mm Hg/ml/min/100 g, respectively; p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The weak relation of systolic blood pressure to left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients is often interpreted as evidence of nonhemodynamic stimuli to muscle growth. To test the hypothesis that left ventricular chamber size, reflecting hemodynamic volume load and myocardial contractility, influences the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension, we studied actual and theoretic relations of left ventricular mass to left ventricular diastolic chamber volume, pressure and volume load, and an index of contractility. Data were obtained from independently measured M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiograms in 50 normal subjects and 50 untreated patients with essential hypertension. Two indices of overall left ventricular load were assessed: total load (systolic blood pressure x left ventricular endocardial surface area) and peak meridional force (systolic blood pressure x left ventricular cross sectional area). A theoretically optimal left ventricular mass, allowing each subject to achieve mean normal peak stress, was calculated as a function of systolic blood pressure and M-mode left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. Left ventricular mass measured by M-mode echo correlated better with two-dimensional echocardiogram derived left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001) than with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.45, p less than 0.001) and best with total load or peak meridional force (r = 0.68 and 0.70, p less than 0.001). In multivariate analysis both end-diastolic volume and blood pressure were independent predictors of systolic mass (p less than 0.001) and explained most of its variability (R = 0.75, p less than 0.001). Theoretically optimal left ventricular mass was more closely related to end-diastolic volume (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) than to systolic blood pressure (r = 0.46, p less than 0.001); thus, the relatively weak correlation between blood pressure and optimal mass reflected the influence of left ventricular cavity size, rather than a lack of proportionality between load and hypertrophy. Actual and theoretically optimal left ventricular mass were closely related (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001), indicating that left ventricular hypertrophy in most cases paralleled hemodynamic load. Left ventricular mass was positively related to stroke index and inversely to contractility (as estimated by the end-systolic stress/volume index ratio), the main determinants of left ventricular chamber volume. In multivariate analysis, systolic blood pressure, stroke index, and the end-systolic stress/volume index ratio were each independently related to left ventricular mass index (all p less than 0.001, multiple R = 0.81) and accounted for 66% of its overall variability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied an in vitro model of reentrant tachycardia in a ring of ventricular endocardial tissue surrounding the canine mitral and aortic valves to understand how the response of a reentrant tachycardia to premature impulses can provide insight into the underlying tachycardia mechanism, circuit characteristics, and nature of the central barrier. Reproducible regular reentrant tachycardias (cycle length range, 177-450 msec) were induced with programmed stimulation in 19 intact preparations studied at 34-38 degrees C. Tachycardias were sustained and stable until terminated by programmed stimulation in 95% of preparations. Reentry was reliably reinitiated during experiments lasting 2-15 hours. Data supporting reentry as the mechanism of these tachycardias included sequential activation around the ring that spanned the cycle length of the tachycardia, unidirectional block during initiation of the reentrant rhythm, and termination of the tachycardia after interruption of the circuit. Tachycardias in 13 preparations were systematically reset by premature stimuli. During reentry, each of these preparations had full recovery of excitability by the end of their excitable gap as evidenced by a flat portion along their resetting response curve (eight of 13) or by lack of faster conduction velocity during the second poststimulus beat after premature impulses that produced a long return cycle (13 of 13). From analysis of the conduction of premature impulses and their return cycles, we reached several conclusions useful for interpreting resetting response curves when the reentrant circuit is not fully accessible for study. The duration of a flat portion of the resetting response curve indicated the duration of the shortest fully recovered excitable gap in the reentrant circuit. The window of reset of the tachycardia reflected only the local excitable gap at the site of stimulation and did not define the shortest excitable gap within the circuit. The extent of advancement of the tachycardia provided a lower-limit estimate of the shortest excitable gap in the reentrant circuit. Advancement of a tachycardia in time by premature stimuli indicated advancement at each point in the circuit. Finally, for tachycardias advanced by premature impulses, the length of the reentrant path cannot be determined by the recovery of a refractory barrier.\r"

  ".W": "Classic cable theory was used to analyze the relation between the activation-recovery interval measured from unipolar electrograms and transmembrane action potential duration. Theoretic analysis demonstrated that the temporal derivative of the extracellular potential is proportional to a spatial weighting of the third temporal derivative of the transmembrane action potentials along a cable with uniform propagation in a homogeneous medium. Thus, the activation-recovery interval, measured as the interval between times of minimum derivative (Vmin) of the QRS and maximum derivative (Vmax) of the T wave, should be related to action potential duration, measured as the interval between times of Vmax of the upstroke and Vmin of the downstroke of the transmembrane action potential. This relation was examined experimentally in 12 anesthetized dogs. Unipolar electrograms and transmembrane action potentials were recorded simultaneously from sites within 2 mm of each other during control states, cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation, localized epicardial warming, and graded reductions in myocardial perfusion. The heart was paced from several sites. There was close correlation between activation-recovery interval and action potential duration measurements taken during cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation and local epicardial warming (r = 0.96 and 0.99 for cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation and warming, respectively). In five animals in which coronary perfusion pressure was gradually lowered, the variables correlated closely over a range of values from 62 to 212 msec (r = 0.98). However, although the overall correlation was good and mean differences between activation-recovery interval and action potential duration were small, in individual cases there were differences up to 24 msec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial imaging with thallium 201 has proven to be an important clinical procedure to assess the severity of the myocardial ischemic insult. Uptake of 201Tl is related to perfusion to and extraction by intact myocardium. Recently, a newer group of agents based on 99mTc alkyl isonitriles has been developed and appears promising for myocardial imaging. Although the distribution of this new agent has been shown to be related to myocardial perfusion, its dependence on myocardial integrity has not been established. This study compared the distribution of 99mTc-2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) with that of 201Tl in a clinically relevant canine model of ischemic insult. Fifteen adult dogs underwent 2 hours of occlusion by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation followed by reperfusion. In one group of dogs, 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI were administered 5 minutes before 35 minutes of reflow (group 1, n = 5). In the other animals, the agents were given 5 minutes after onset of reflow, and dogs were killed after 10 (group 2, n = 5) and 35 minutes of reperfusion (group 3, n = 5). 99mTc-MIBI activity was significantly correlated with 201Tl activity (r = 0.91, 0.77, and 0.92, for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Both 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI activities were correlated similarly with blood flow in all models. In groups 1 and 2, 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI activities correlated directly with microsphere-determined blood flow, whereas in group 3, they correlated inversely. The present study shows that in these models of myocardial ischemic insult, 99mTc-MIBI distribution is closely related to that of 201Tl.\r"

  ".U": "90124919\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed a method to quantify and map regional wall thickening throughout the left ventricle (LV) with magnetic resonance imaging. In contrast to methods that measure planar wall thickness and thickening, this method uses the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the left ventricle to calculate the perpendicular thickness of the wall. We tested this method at three levels of increasing complexity using 1) phantom studies, 2) in vivo experiments in dogs with normal cardiac function, and 3) in vivo studies in dogs during acute ischemia. Experiments were conducted in 15 open-chest dogs imaged by a 0.38 T iron core magnet. Five short-axis images at end diastole and end systole were obtained with the spin echo technique by use of the QRS as a trigger for end diastole and the second heart sound, S2, to time end systole. After acquisition of preischemic images, acute ischemia was induced by either coronary artery ligation (n = 5) or intracoronary dental rubber injection (n = 5), which produced severe transmural ischemia. By use of computer-aided contouring of the endocardial and epicardial borders, each image was divided into 16 segments with radial lines originating from the midwall centroid. A 3D volume element was defined as that generated by connecting two matched planar segments in two adjacent image planes. This defined 64 volume elements comprising the entire left ventricle. Thickness and thickening before and during ischemia were then calculated by using the planar segments and the 3D volume elements. In phantom studies, the 3D method was accurate, independent of the angle of inclination of the image plane to the phantom wall, whereas the planar method showed considerable overestimation of thickness when the image plane was oblique to the phantom wall. In the dogs before induction of ischemia, the 3D method demonstrated the well-established normal taper in end-diastolic wall thickness from 1.10 +/- 0.02 cm at the base to 1.05 +/- 0.11 cm at the apex (p less than 0.01). By contrast, the planar method did not detect the decrease in thickness toward the apex (1.13 +/- 0.07 cm at the base vs. 1.16 +/- 0.14 cm at the apex, p = NS). During acute ischemia, thickening was calculated by both methods at the center of the ischemic zone defined by Monastral blue nonstaining and compared with the preischemic values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The device was small enough to be introduced in a 7F or 8F sheath, and it measured 20-25 mm. It has no hooks and consists of a foam occluder from the left atrium and a counter-occluder from the right atrium, buttoned independently. The animals were observed by angiography and color flow mapping, and they were electively killed at various intervals up to 2 months after occlusion. The device was not thrombogenic and had endothelialized by 2-3 weeks. All atrial defects were found to be completely occluded. Complications occurred only with the first three prototype devices, including counter-occluder detachment, right atrial perforation, and need for double occlusion and pulmonary artery embolization. No such complications occurred in the last 17 experiments because of modifications of the device and operator experience. These observations showed the feasibility of occlusion of moderate-size atrial septal defects in piglets by a new device introduced through a small sheath. The method appears promising for potential human application.\r"

Resting myocardial oxygen consumption in the 13 shunt lambs was significantly higher than in the nine control lambs (989 +/- 104 [+/- SEM] vs. 432 +/- 41 mumol/min/100 g left ventricle). This was achieved by a significantly higher left ventricular myocardial blood flow (294 +/- 33 vs. 143 +/- 16 ml/min/100 g left ventricle) because the arteriovenous oxygen concentration difference across the left ventricular free wall was similar in shunt and control lambs. Infusion of nitroprusside did not significantly change myocardial oxygen consumption and regional myocardial blood flows at 10 and 50 minutes after the onset of the infusion. This occurred despite a substantial drop in aortic and left atrial pressures and stroke volume, which decreases wall stress as well as external work of the left ventricle. Heart rate, however, increased significantly. We postulate that, during infusion of nitroprusside, the potential decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption due to a decrease in wall stress and external work of the left ventricle is neutralized by the consequences of the increased heart rate. In view of this and because of its hemodynamic effects, we do not consider sodium nitroprusside useful in the treatment of circulatory congestion in patients with left-to-right shunts, normal arterial pressures, and normal systemic blood flows.\r"

Calculations of left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes from 2DE were compared with cast volumes of these ventricles. Also, at different levels of left atrial pressure, left ventricular stroke volumes calculated from 2DE were compared with stroke volumes measured simultaneously by an electromagnetic flowmeter. There was a good correlation between volumes determined from 2DE (y axis) and from casts (x axis) for both the left (r = 0.92; y = 0.2 + 1.1x; SEE = 0.19 ml) and right ventricle (r = 0.90; y = 0.7 + 0.9x; SEE = 0.21 ml).

These effects were evaluated by use of an experimental model of orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). AVRT was induced in 15 dogs over a wide range of retrograde conduction times before and after two doses of diltiazem. Diltiazem produced a tachycardia-related suppression of atrioventricular nodal conduction resulting in greater efficacy for faster than for slower AVRTs. The degree of slowing for tachycardias that remained inducible after diltiazem administration was greater for AVRTs with a rapid initial rate (dose 1, 29%; dose 2, 40%) than for slower AVRTs (dose 1, 11%, p less than 0.01; dose 2, 18%, p less than 0.001). Rate-dependent AVRT slowing occurred because of a time-dependent phase of AH interval prolongation after the onset of tachycardia, which was observed only after diltiazem administration. to further clarify the mechanism of diltiazem's selective actions against faster tachycardias, its effects on the minimum pathway for reentry, or wavelength, were examined in four dogs. The ratio of refractory period to revolution time (RP/RT), an index of wavelength, was measured for each AVRT before and after diltiazem administration. Diltiazem increased the positive slope of the relation between RP/RT and the AVRT rate threefold compared with control (p less than 0.05). This rate-dependent effect prevented AVRT when RP/RT became greater than unity. In conclusion, rate-dependent atrioventricular node depression by diltiazem results in greater tachycardia slowing and higher rates of termination during atrioventricular reentrant tachycardias with faster initial rates and shorter retrograde conduction intervals.\r"

Group 2 included nine dogs in whom VT developed 16-24 hours after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (abnormal automaticity group). Group 3 included six dogs with normally conducted sinus beats, whereas group 4 consisted of six animals having a ventricular escape rhythm. With the exception of group 3, all dogs had surgically induced complete atrioventricular block. All animals were studied while conscious and without premedication.

In groups 3 and 4, 2 mg/kg flunarizine was given after the rhythm was registered for 20 minutes. The cycle lengths of the different rhythms were compared before and after flunarizine.

  ".W": "This study tested the feasibility of neodymium:YAG laser photocoagulation of selected sinus node areas to depress sinus rate responsiveness. In 14 open-chest dogs, origin of the sinus impulse (O point) was electrically mapped from the epicardium before and during isoproterenol infusion. Epicardial laser photocoagulation was applied to the O point observed during isoproterenol infusion and stepwise to remapped new O points until a 30 +/- 5% decrease in heart rate occurred. Long-term effects were assessed by Holter monitoring and electropharmacologic testing preoperatively and up to 10 weeks or 6 months. Mean (+/- SEM) percent decreases were observed at 10 weeks in the following parameters: average 24-hour heart rate, 17.4 +/- 5.0%; maximum heart rate on Holter, 30.5 +/- 3.5%; heart rate during pharmacologic autonomic blockade, 32.7 +/- 3.5%; and maximum heart rate on isoproterenol, 23.1 +/- 4.6% (all p less than 0.01). Curves with pacemaker recovery time plotted against control cycle length remained unchanged. Holter monitoring did not show excessive bradycardic episodes even after administration of propranolol. In three control dogs (sham operation), sinus node function remained unchanged. Histologic study of the irradiated area showed replacement by inflammatory cells, fibrosis, and cartilage formation with surrounding normal cells and occasional cells resembling pacemaker-like cells at the caudal end of the sinoatrial node. This study suggests that 1) map-guided graded laser photocoagulation of sinus node regions showing earliest activation during catecholamine stimulation successfully limits maximum heart rates without causing significant bradycardia, 2) the effects are long lasting, and 3) the remaining pacemaker behaves like the sinus node. Laser modification of sinus node function could become a form of nonpharmacologic heart rate control in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing surgery and in the syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "After a change in cardiac output, the magnitude of potential blood volume redistribution was investigated in 10 dogs anesthetized with chloralose. All of the venous return was pumped into a reservoir, using servocontrolled pumps to maintain fixed superior and inferior vena cava pressures. The cardiac output was set at various levels by pumping from the reservoir into the right atrium. Changes in reservoir volume were assumed to reflect the changes in vascular blood volume. After measuring the control responses, cardiovascular reflexes were blocked with hexamethonium. Reducing the cardiac output, for example, from 110 to 80 ml/(min.kg) with reflexes intact, caused a 9.2-ml/kg transfer of blood from the dog to the reservoir. With reflexes blocked, the same change in cardiac output caused 6.8 ml/kg of the blood to be transferred. Under the control conditions, throughout the range of 50-140 ml/(min.kg), an increase or decrease of cardiac output of 1 ml/(min.kg) elicited a 0.304 +/- 0.086 (mean +/- SD) ml/kg change in dog blood volume; with reflexes blocked, the flow sensitivity was 0.239 +/- 0.062 ml/kg. Thus, only 21% of the total blood volume redistribution was attributable to active reflex responses. Deterioration of the preparation may have attenuated the magnitude of active reflex activity. Neither the systemic vascular compliance of 1.80 +/- 0.35 ml/mm Hg.kg nor the fraction of venous return from the superior vena cava of 26.5 +/- 4.6% was significantly changed by reflex blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to investigate further the mechanism by which thromboxane synthesis inhibition improves recovery of function in stunned myocardium (15 minutes of coronary occlusion and 3 hours of reperfusion) in barbital anesthetized dogs. The recovery of regional myocardial wall function (percent segment shortening, % SS) following treatment with two doses (0.5 and 10 mg/kg) of a thromboxane receptor blocker, BM 13.505, given prior to coronary occlusion, was not different from that of a control group (3-hour % SS of pretreatment control, PTC, 12 +/- 11) throughout reperfusion (3-hour % SS of PTC with BM 13.505: 0.5 mg/kg 14 +/- 10; 10 mg/kg, 27 +/- 9). In contrast, the specific thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel (3.0 mg/kg), significantly improved % SS throughout reperfusion (3-hour % SS of PTC, 66 +/- 8). In addition, while dazmegrel produced a marked decrease in thromboxane, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was significantly increased in coronary venous blood throughout the occlusion and reperfusion period. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, had no beneficial effect on functional recovery (3-hour % SS of PTC, 5 +/- 6), attenuated the dazmegrel induced shunting to prostacyclin, and completely prevented the beneficial effects of dazmegrel on functional recovery (3-hour % SS of PTC, 17 +/- 12). Thus, a redirection to endogenous cardioprotective prostanoids, such as prostacyclin, appears to be responsible for the beneficial effect of thromboxane synthesis inhibition on postischemic recovery in stunned myocardium whereas thromboxane does not appear to be an important mediator of the stunning phenomenon.\r"

Forty-eight hours later (72-96 hours after onset of chest pain), patients were injected with 2.2 mCi thallium 201, and two sets of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained simultaneously using dual energy windows set for the 247 keV indium photopeak and the 70 keV thallium peak. Seventeen patients had repeat scans at 4 hours. 111In AM uptake and 201Tl defects were localized to one or more of 24 coronal and sagittal segments. Scans with only 201Tl defects and corresponding 111In AM uptake were classified as matches; scans with unmatched 201Tl defects in addition to matching regions corresponding to electrocardiographic infarct location were classified as mismatches; and scans with 201Tl and 111In AM uptake in the same segments were classified as overlap. Scan patterns were correlated with clinical evidence for residual ischemia occurring within 6 weeks of infarct and including infarct extension, recurrent angina, and positive predischarge low-level or 6-week symptom-limited stress tests and with coronary anatomy. Fourteen patients had only matching patterns (group 1), 23 had mismatches (group 2), and five had 201Tl-111In overlap as the predominant pattern. None of the patients in group 1 had previous myocardial infarction; in each, the matched area corresponded to the Q wave location on electrocardiogram, and none had further in-hospital ischemic events or positive stress tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of mitral flow dynamics during exercise is critically important in patients who receive percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) because limited mitral flow during exercise provokes hemodynamic deterioration and involves cardiogenic symptoms in patients with mitral stenosis. To examine mitral flow dynamics during exercise, we applied continuous wave Doppler technique in 20 patients with mitral stenosis. Exercise Doppler study was performed 2 days before and 5 days after PTMC. PTMC increased mitral valve area from 1.0 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SD) to 1.9 +/- 0.5 cm2 and decreased mean transmitral pressure gradient from 8 +/- 2 to 4 +/- 1 mm Hg at rest. Moreover, PTMC decreased mean transmitral pressure gradient from 21 +/- 6 to 11 +/- 4 mm Hg at submaximal exercise. The extent of an increase in mitral valve area by PTMC correlated with a decrease in the mean transmitral pressure gradient at the submaximal exercise (r = -0.76, p less than 0.01) and that at rest (r = -0.52, p less than 0.05). Heart rate after PTMC during exercise was significantly lower than that before PTMC, indicating that the compensatory mechanism (tachycardia) to increase cardiac output during exercise is less necessary after PTMC. Thus, we conclude that the mitral flow dynamics during exercise is improved, as well as the resting mitral flow dynamics 5 days after PTMC, and that exercise Doppler study enabled us to make a noninvasive evaluation of the mitral flow dynamics in patients who receive PTMC.\r"

Serum PIIINP was increased on the second to third postinfarction day (p less than 0.01) and remained elevated for more than 4 months. Peak values were observed on the third to seventh postinfarction day. The individual peak changes were correlated to infarction size calculated from serum CK-MB and serum lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.60, p = 0.02). The changes in distribution of PIIINP-related antigens in serum after gel chromatography were similar to changes observed during wound healing in humans. PIIINP is cleaved off procollagen type III during the biosynthesis of type III collagen, which characterizes the early stages of repair and inflammation. Our findings suggest that serum PIIINP reflects the repair processes and scar formation following acute myocardial infarction. The serum PIIINP alterations in acute myocardial infarction differ essentially from the changes in myocardial enzymes reflecting myocardial injury. Serum PIIINP may therefore provide new and clinically relevant information on the healing of myocardial infarction.\r"

Selective H1-receptor stimulation was achieved by infusing histamine into the left coronary artery at a rate of 2.0 micrograms/min for 5 minutes after pretreatment with cimetidine (25 mg/kg). Plasma histamine concentration in the coronary sinus, coronary sinus blood flow, heart rate, and aortic pressure were measured before, during, and after the histamine infusion. Coronary arterial diameter was measured by cinevideodensitometric analysis of coronary arteriograms performed before and immediately after the histamine infusion. During the histamine infusion, plasma histamine concentration in the coronary sinus increased from 0.33 +/- 0.06 to 5.86 +/- 0.71 ng/ml (p less than 0.01); coronary sinus blood flow increased from 98 +/- 12 to 124 +/- 13 ml/min (p less than 0.01), and coronary vascular resistance decreased from 1,113 +/- 117 to 851 +/- 91 mm Hg.min/l (p less than 0.01).

A characteristic response pattern to dipyridamole (DIP) infusion has been previously described in syndrome X and arterial hypertension: ST segment depression without any measurable systolic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to establish whether acute cardiac rejection might induce electrocardiographic alterations during DIP infusion. Changes in the 12-lead electrocardiogram and two-dimensional echocardiogram during high-dose DIP infusion (up to 0.84 mg/kg in 10 minutes) were evaluated within 24 hours of endomyocardial biopsy in 14 transplanted patients. A total of 47 biopsy-controlled DIP studies were performed within 5 weeks after cardiac transplantation. For each patient, at least 7 days elapsed between two consecutive studies. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic tracings were analyzed without prior knowledge of endomyocardial biopsy findings. No remarkable side effects occurred in any case, so that the DIP study could be completed in all patients. A diagnostic (greater than 0.1 mV) ST segment depression was found in 11 studies. The sensitivity and specificity of DIP-induced ST segment depression for the detection of biopsy-proven acute rejection were 72% and 94%, respectively. These data show that DIP stress is feasible and safe in transplanted patients and that acute cardiac rejection can be accompanied by DIP-induced ST segment depression without detectable impairment in systolic function. These changes might provide noninvasive markers for surveillance of rejection.\r"

We hypothesized that among patients currently considered appropriate for transplantation who could nonetheless subsequently be stabilized on medical therapy tailored to hemodynamic goals, survivors after 6 months of sustained medical therapy would demonstrate exercise capacity comparable to that of survivors of transplantation. Of 146 patients referred, 118 (81%) were discharged on tailored therapy without transplantation, and 88 (60%) were stable for at least 1 month. Stability after discharge was more likely in patients with lower right atrial pressures and better renal function on therapy. Of the 88 stable patients, 45 patients were listed for transplant, and 43 were ineligible or unwilling. From these patients, 42 survivors for more than 6 months follow-up after cardiac transplantation or tailoring of medical therapy underwent exercise testing. Baseline functional and hemodynamic status and left ventricular ejection fraction (15 +/- 4%) were not different between the transplant and sustained medical survivor groups at the time of initial evaluation.

During atrial fibrillation, the mean ventricular cycle length decreased from 434 +/- 88 to 352 +/- 56 msec (p less than 0.001), and the shortest preexcited RR interval decreased from 302 +/- 56 to 256 +/- 43 msec (p less than 0.01). In another seven patients, propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) was administered before atropine, and atropine lengthened the anterograde block cycle length and the effective refractory period of the accessory AV connection; the magnitude of these effects was similar to that in the patients who did not receive propranolol. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that resting vagal tone exerts a direct depressant effect on accessory AV connections that does not require background sympathetic activity to be manifest.\r"

  ".W": "Although a silent ischemic electrocardiographic response to treadmill exercise in clinically healthy populations is associated with an increased likelihood of future coronary events (i.e., angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death), such a response has a low predictive value for future events because of the low prevalence of disease in asymptomatic populations. To examine whether detection of reduced regional perfusion by thallium scintigraphy improved the predictive value of exercise-induced ST segment depression, we performed maximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and thallium scintigraphy (201Tl) in 407 asymptomatic volunteers 40-96 years of age (mean = 60) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. The prevalence of exercise-induced silent ischemia, defined by concordant ST segment depression and a thallium perfusion defect, increased more than sevenfold from 2% in the fifth and sixth decades to 15% in the ninth decade. Over a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, cardiac events developed in 9.8% of subjects and consisted of 20 cases of new angina pectoris, 13 myocardial infarctions, and seven deaths. Events occurred in 7% of individuals with both negative 201Tl and ECG, 8% of those with either test positive, and 48% of those in whom both tests were positive (p less than 0.001). By proportional hazards analysis, age, hypertension, exercise duration, and a concordant positive ECG and 201Tl result were independent predictors of coronary events. Furthermore, those with positive ECG and 201Tl had a 3.6-fold relative risk for subsequent coronary events, independent of conventional risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the relation of uncomplicated angina symptoms to risk of coronary heart disease mortality within 3 years in a prospective study of 8,359 people aged 65 and older residing in three communities. From baseline (1981-1983) to the third year of follow-up (1984-1986), there were 245 deaths from coronary heart disease. Three classifications of chest pain were defined using the Rose Questionnaire: nonexertional chest pain, chest pain on exertion (including angina), and angina. Exertional chest pain was a strong, independent predictor of coronary heart disease death for older men and women. There were no differences in the prognostic implications of this symptom between the sexes; the relative risks being 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.4) in men and 2.7 (1.7-4.2) in women. The risk of coronary heart disease mortality for those reporting chest pain on exertion was at least as high as that for participants whose symptoms met the Rose Questionnaire criteria for angina. The association between exertional chest pain and coronary heart disease mortality was independent of other coronary risk factors. The relation was specific for deaths from coronary heart disease, as there was no association between exertional chest pain and noncoronary causes of death. Chest pain on exertion conveys important prognostic information about risk of coronary death in older populations, regardless of gender.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of acute coronary occlusion on systolic and diastolic left ventricular pressure-volume relations was studied in 10 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Pressure-volume relations were obtained by conductance catheter and micromanometer techniques and with volume load altered by transient inferior vena caval occlusion. End-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relations were obtained at baseline, during 60-90 seconds of ischemia, and at return to baseline after angioplasty balloon deflation. Coronary occlusion significantly altered systolic and diastolic chamber function. Systolic dysfunction was characterized by a reproducible rightward shift of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (+25.4 +/- 18.4 ml) that was greater for proximal left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery occlusions (+41 ml) than for distal or right coronary artery occlusions (+15.4 ml, p less than 0.05). Occlusion also lowered chamber systolic function indexes, such as the end-systolic pressure-volume relation slope (from 4.2 to 2.8 mm Hg/ml) and preload recruitable stroke work (from 97 to 78.6 mm Hg). All systolic (and diastolic) changes were resolved with successful angioplasty. Diastolic abnormalities during angioplasty were characterized by prolonged pressure relaxation and an upward shift of the resting diastolic pressure-volume data and by an apparent increase in chamber elastic stiffness. However, when end-diastolic data from multiple beats during inferior vena caval occlusion were compared, control and ischemic end-diastolic pressure-volume relations displayed little or no difference. Thus, elevations in resting diastolic pressure-volume relations and apparent increase in chamber elastic stiffness during coronary occlusion in humans appear dominated by altered right ventricular or pericardial loading. These data indicate that pressure-volume analysis is useful in assessing the functional significance of coronary lesions and reperfusion.\r"

Eighty-seven unipolar electrocardiograms distributed over the anterior chest and the back were recorded simultaneously before and after the submaximal treadmill exercise. For each lead, the duration from the QRS onset to the time of the most rapid decrease in QRS voltage was measured (index of ventricular activation [IVA]). Based o the data provided by these 87 leads, IVA isochrone maps (IVA map) in preexercise and in postexercise, as well as IVA maps showing the difference between preexercise and postexercise, were constructed. The IVA was defined as abnormal when it exceeded (mean + 2 SD) the normal range. We called the area with the abnormal IVA, the \"+2SD area.\" In patients having a stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, the +2SD area in each map was located mainly on the left anterior chest, whereas in patients having a stenosis in the right coronary artery, the +2SD area in each map was located mainly on the right lower thoracic surface. Moreover, the +2SD area of patients with both left anterior descending and right coronary artery disease appeared on both the left anterior chest and the right lower thoracic surface. In patients with left circumflex artery disease, however, the location of the +2SD area did not suggest a stenotic site because of its small population. On the other hand, it was difficult to determine the ischemic site from the body surface distribution of ST segment depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with pericardial effusion in the early phase of myocardial infarction, 330 patients with acute Q wave infarction were studied. According to echocardiography, 83 patients had pericardial effusion on the third day of hospitalization, and careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was absent in 45 patients and was present in 38 patients. Based on seven clinical variables, multivariate analysis was performed to determine the important variables related to the occurrence of pericardial effusion with and without pericardial rub. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and left ventricular segments with advanced asynergy were the significant factors related to the occurrence of pericardial effusion without a pericardial rub. The presence of ventricular aneurysmal motion, left ventricular segments with advanced asynergy, and alveolar arterial oxygen difference were related to pericardial effusion with a pericardial rub. Therefore, a hemodynamic factor was the major mechanism associated with the increase in extravascular myocardial fluid and the consequent occurrence of hydropericardia in the absence of a pericardial rub, whereas an increase in the microvascular permeability in the myocardium with excessive fluid exudating through the irritated epicardial surface was the mechanism related to pericardial effusion with a pericardial rub in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".U": "90124955\r", 
  ".W": "Prognosis in classically described dilated congestive cardiomyopathy has been reported to be related to ventricular size. Mildly dilated congestive cardiomyopathy (MDCM) has been defined as end-stage heart failure of unknown etiology (New York Heart Association class IV, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%), occurring with neither typical hemodynamic signs of restrictive myopathy nor significant ventricular dilatation (less than 15% above normal range). The present study includes follow-up in 12 nontransplant patients. In the first 4 months after diagnosis, two patients improved and are living, and two showed cardiac dilation and clinical deterioration and died. Six of the remaining eight with persistent MDCM died (four with intractable heart failure and two, sudden deaths) without change in ventricular size before death, despite medical therapy over 20 +/- 8 months. Eight comparable transplanted patients with persistent MDCM demonstrated improved total survival by life table analysis (p less than 0.05). A family history of congestive cardiomyopathy was found in nine of 16 patients (56%) with persistent MDCM. Nontransplant patients were older (p less than 0.02), but other findings were similar in the two groups. Endomyocardial biopsies available in 14 of 16 cases showed little or no myofibrillar loss in spite of severe hemodynamic impairment. The degree of myofibrillar loss did not correlate with hemodynamic parameters but showed good correlation with left ventricular size, that is, five of six patients with no myofibrillar loss had normal ventricular size, whereas all eight patients with mild myofibrillar loss had mild cardiomegaly (p less than 0.002). Our current experience suggests a somewhat variable but negative prognosis after prospective diagnosis of MDCM, with poor survival in patients with persistence of the original diagnostic features during follow-up. Preservation of heart size in MDCM is probably related to lack of significant myofibrillar loss. Thus, irrespective of heart size or myofibrillar preservation on biopsy, heart transplantation should be strongly considered in MDCM if signs of severe cardiac dysfunction persist despite therapy.\r"

The present study provides an analysis of substrate and enzyme content, fiber typing, and capillarization in skeletal muscle biopsy samples obtained at rest from the vastus lateralis in 11 patients with long-term heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction, 21 +/- 8%) and nine normal subjects. Patients demonstrated a reduced peak exercise oxygen consumption (13.0 +/- 3.3 ml/kg/min) when compared with normals (30.2 +/- 8.6 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.001) and had an accelerated rise in blood lactate levels during exercise. In mixed fiber skeletal muscle, total phosphorylase and glycolytic enzyme activities were not different in the two groups, whereas mitochondrial enzymes involved in terminal oxidation were decreased in patients as compared with normal subjects as indicated by reductions in succinate dehydrogenase (51 +/- 15 vs. 81 +/- 17 microM/g protein/min, p less than 0.001) and citrate synthetase (26 +/- 7 vs. 43 +/- 20 microM/g protein/min, p less than 0.05). 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase, an important enzyme mediating beta-oxidation of fatty acids, was also reduced in patients as compared with normals (18 +/- 7 vs. 27 +/- 10 microM/g protein/min, p less than 0.05). There was no difference in high-energy phosphagens or lactate concentration of mixed muscle in the two groups, whereas glycogen content was decreased in patients (262 +/- 29 vs. 298 +/- 35 microM glucosyl units/kg dry wt, p = 0.01). Patients demonstrated a reduced percentage of slow twitch type I fibers (36 +/- 7% vs. 52 +/- 22%, p less than 0.05) and had a higher percentage of type IIb fast twitch fibers (24 +/- 9% vs. 11 +/- 12%, p = 0.02), which were smaller than the type IIb fibers seen in normal subjects (p less than 0.05). In patients, the number of capillaries per fiber was decreased for type I and type IIa fibers (both, p less than 0.03), but the ratio of capillaries to cross-sectional fiber area was not different for the two groups. These data demonstrate major alterations in skeletal muscle histology and biochemistry in patients with long-term heart failure, including fiber atrophy, a decrease in percentage of composition of type I fibers, and an increase in type IIb fibers accompanied by a decrease in oxidative enzyme capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the hypertensive group, LV mass index correlated with nighttime (8:00 PM to 6:00 AM) systolic (r = 0.51) and diastolic (r = 0.35) blood pressure more closely than with daytime (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM) systolic (r = 0.38) and diastolic (r = 0.20) BP, or with casual systolic (r = 0.33) and diastolic (r = 0.27) BP.

Dynamic 24-hour recordings were obtained in two groups of ambulant subjects. In 18 hospitalized patients free to move, direct high-fidelity arterial pressures and electrocardiograms were recorded, and in an additional 28 nonhospitalized subjects, only electrocardiograms were obtained. Spectral analysis of systolic arterial pressure and of RR interval variabilities provided quantitative markers of sympathetic and vagal control of the sinus node and of sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone. With this approach, the low-frequency (approximately 0.1 Hz) component of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities is considered a marker primarily of sympathetic activity, whereas the high-frequency (approximately 0.25 Hz) component of RR interval variability, related to respiration, seems to be a marker primarily of vagal activity. We observed a pronounced and consistent reduction in the markers of sympathetic activity and an increase in those of vagal activity during the night. In the invasive studies, while the subjects were still lying in bed after waking up, the markers of sympathetic activity rose rapidly and concomitantly with a simultaneous vagal withdrawal. Noninvasive studies confirmed the early morning rise of the markers of sympathetic activity and the circadian pattern of sympathovagal balance. These data indicate that the ominously increased rate of cardiovascular events in the morning hours may reflect the sudden rise of sympathetic activity and the reduction of vagal tone.\r"

  ".W": "Mitral valve repair provides substantial advantages over mitral valve replacement in patients with severe mitral regurgitation. However, because of the possibility of persistent regurgitation, an intraoperative technique is needed to provide an immediate and accurate assessment of the adequacy of the repair before closure of the chest. One hundred patients with pure mitral regurgitation were studied with intraoperative epicardial Doppler color flow mapping immediately before and after valve repair. Intraoperative assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation showed good agreement with preoperative left ventriculography and with standard precordial Doppler echocardiography before and after surgery. Postrepair intraoperative Doppler studies showed satisfactory surgical results in 92 patients. Postrepair intraoperative Doppler studies in the remaining eight patients demonstrated unsatisfactory results: persistent significant regurgitation in four, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in three, and a persistent flail leaflet in one. In six of the eight patients, further surgery was performed during the same thoracotomy. In two patients, the intraoperative postrepair Doppler findings of persistent regurgitation were confirmed on precordial Doppler studies within 5 days, and mitral reoperation was required. Intraoperative epicardial Doppler color flow mapping provided a \"safety net\" that ensured a successful outcome in all 100 patients by providing the surgeon with a direct means to assess the success of the operation and the need for further surgery.\r"

Coronary spasm involved the right coronary artery in 15 patients (group 1) and the left anterior descending coronary artery in 10 patients (group 2). Biventricular function was assessed by radionuclide angiography under basal conditions, during spontaneous or ergonovine-induced ischemia, and after resolution of the ischemic attack. Myocardial perfusion was assessed by thallium 201 scintigraphy in 21 patients of this series during superimposable ischemic episodes. In group 1, ischemia caused RV (14 of 15 patients) and LV (13 of 15 patients) regional dysfunction with significant reduction in RV and LV ejection fractions. The interventricular spetum was involved in six of 15 patients, causing a more pronounced LV impairment. In group 2, all patients showed septal dyssynergies associated with a reduction of LV ejection fraction; absent or trivial RV involvement was observed. In both groups, LV perfusion defects were present in all patients with LV wall motion abnormalities during ischemia, matching the site of regional dyssynergies. Thus, in a group of patients with variant angina and single-vessel disease, transient occlusion of the right coronary artery directly caused RV and LV impairment; in these patients, the extent of LV but not RV dysfunction appeared related to the presence of septal ischemia. Vasospasm of the left anterior descending coronary artery consistently caused LV dysfunction not associated with secondary effects on RV systolic function.\r"

To establish ECG features that suggested the presence of multiple accessory pathways in these patients, we initially studied the 12-lead ECG during maximal preexcitation in 101 patients with single accessory pathways. Distinctive 12-lead ECG patterns were noted for six defined anatomic areas around the right and left atrioventricular groove. Multiple preexcited QRS morphologies, each typical for a separate accessory pathway, and atypical preexcited QRS morphologies were recorded during atrial fibrillation in 31 of 47 (66%) patients with multiple accessory pathways. By comparison, the ECG during sinus rhythm and rapid atrial pacing identified 14 (32%) and 26 (55%) of the patients, respectively. In 12 (26%) patients in whom evidence for multiple accessory pathways was absent from endocardial mapping data, atrial fibrillation provided the diagnosis. In five (11%) patients, atrial fibrillation was the only method that demonstrated the presence of multiple accessory pathways. A combination of ECG findings during atrial fibrillation and rapid atrial pacing plus endocardial mapping data identified 43 (91%) of the patients with multiple accessory pathways. There were two unique fusion patterns on the 12-lead ECG that were characteristic of specific multiple accessory pathway combinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum thiocyanate and cotinine levels were used as measures of smoke exposure in the children and thiocyanate was proportional to the number of parental cigarettes smoked each day (p = 0.0001). Paternal smoking had no effect on these measures. Whole blood 2,3-diphosphoglycerate was higher in smoke-exposed than unexposed children (p less than 0.01) and was related to the thiocyanate level (p less than 0.02). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was lower in passive smoking children (p less than 0.05); the HDL2 subfraction was reduced in passive smoking boys, while the HDL3 subfraction was reduced in passive smoking girls. Significant adverse alterations in systemic oxygen transport and lipoprotein profiles are already present in preadolescent children exposed to long-term passive cigarette smoke, primarily from maternal smoke. Children with long-term exposure to passive smoke may be at elevated risk for the development of premature coronary heart disease.\r"

Studies were performed before and 20 minutes after sublingual administration of nifedipine (20 mg). Heart rates were held constant (79 +/- 12 beats/min, mean +/- SD) by right atrial pacing. Left ventricular volumes and instantaneous rates of left ventricular volume were derived from frame-by-frame (20-msec) analyses of left ventricular biplane angiograms. Left ventricular peak systolic pressure (from 122 +/- 21 to 108 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.01 vs. control) and mean aortic pressure (from 96 +/- 15 to 87 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) decreased significantly with nifedipine.

  ".W": "Repeat low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis and blood flow determinations in the forearm and leg were performed in 10 patients (age range, 13-49 years; four male, six female) with familial hypercholesterolemia (eight homozygous, two heterozygous). To perform LDL apheresis, plasma was first separated by a polysulphone hollow fiber filter; then, LDL was selectively removed from plasma by dextran sulphate cellulose beads packed in columns. Blood flows in the forearm and leg were determined at rest and during a reactive hyperemia test (peak flow). This test was performed noninvasively by a strain-gauge plethysmograph with semicontinuous registration of arterial blood flow variables before the first apheresis and 3 weeks after the last of six procedures for apheresis. Resting arterial blood flows in the forearm and leg were slightly increased after repeat LDL apheresis (p less than 0.05). Peak blood flow in the leg significantly increased (+34%, p less than 0.01). No change in peak blood flow in the forearm was observed. Systolic blood pressures were slightly but significantly reduced (p less than 0.05); forearm peripheral resistances were also reduced (p less than 0.05). Flow response was not related to LDL receptor status. Blood and plasma viscosities were determined before and 7 days after the last apheresis. Blood viscosity was significantly reduced after LDL apheresis at shear rates of 11.25-450 sec-1. Plasma viscosity did not change.\r"

Imaging, however, will need to be performed with exercise or dipyridamole to detect ischemia and to differentiate salvaged but still ischemic myocardium from scar. Accordingly, 12 dogs were given mild-to-moderate left circumflex coronary stenoses (group 2), and 10 dogs were given severe stenoses (group 3). In five control dogs (group 1), there was no stenosis. After an intravenous infusion of dipyridamole (0.08 mg/kg/min for 4 minutes), Tc-MIBI was injected into the right atrium. Over the next 4-hour study period, myocardial Tc-MIBI activities were continuously monitored in both the left anterior descending (LAD) (normal) and left circumflex (LCx) (ischemic) coronary artery (ischemic) zones using miniature cadmium telluride radiation detectors and serial gamma camera images were acquired when necessary. Tc-MIBI was rapidly taken up by nonischemic, mild-to-moderate, and severe ischemic myocardium. The initial myocardial uptake of Tc-MIBI was linearly related (r = 0.97) to regional myocardial blood flow at rates up to 2.0 ml/min/g. After the initial uptake, the mean 4-hour fractional myocardial clearance was similar between the control (0.09 +/- 0.03 [+/- SEM]) and group 2 (0.07 +/- 0.03) and group 3 (0.09 +/- 0.03) ischemic zones. Tc-MIBI blood clearance was rapid and biexponential with an initial fast clearance phase followed by a slow clearance phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cumulative release of enzymes in plasma was calculated from these data by using a previously validated two-compartment model for circulating enzymes. Regional myocardial ischemia was measured by injection of radiolabeled microspheres. After 48 hours, the dogs were killed, and a detailed map of left ventricular enzyme activity was obtained from 108 tissue samples. Cumulative release into plasma of CK and HBD was 96 +/- 20% and 112 +/- 26%, respectively, of the total activities depleted from the heart (mean +/- SD, n = 11). The scatter in these values is inherent to the calculations, and it is concluded that both enzymes are recovered completely in plasma and, thus, can be used as quantitative markers of injury. Discrepancies between this result and earlier reports on the recovery of CK are only partly apparent and can be explained partly by underestimation of the elimination rate of CK from plasma, irregardless of tissue edema and incomplete extraction of enzyme activity from tissue.\r"

To evaluate the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, intravascular endoprosthetic stents of titanium-nickel-alloy were implanted transluminally in seven normal and 21 atherosclerotic rabbits. In normal rabbits, a 3.5-mm diameter stent was implanted in the aorta and a 2.5-mm diameter stent in the right iliac artery, which were followed with serial angiograms from 6 weeks (n = 7) to 8 months (n = 4). There was a mean stenosis of 13.1% in the 2.5-mm and 13.6% in the 3.5-mm stent. There was no significant narrowing compared with the adjacent control segments of artery; histopathology showed a thin, fibrous neointima with smooth muscle cells. Each atherosclerotic rabbit was balloon dilated at two separate stenotic sites; each site was 2.0 cm in length. The aortic site (with 28.8 +/- 13.8% mean stenosis [+/- SD]) was dilated with a 3.5-mm balloon, and the iliac site (with 36.5 +/- 14.2% stenosis) was dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon. In each site, an intravascular stent of corresponding diameter and 7-mm length was implanted in one half of the dilated segment, assigned randomly, and the other half served as the angioplasty control. Angiographically observed restenosis rates and the corresponding histopathology were similar in the atherosclerotic segments that had angioplasty alone versus the atherosclerotic segments that had angioplasty plus stenting. The mean neointimal thickness in the aortas and iliac arteries, respectively, measured 247 +/- 181 microns (+/- SD) and 218 +/- 77 microns after 6 weeks (n = 8) versus 321 +/- 168 and 308 +/- 189 microns after 20 weeks (n = 5, p = NS). At 20 weeks follow-up, there was 29.1 +/- 29.8% (median, 16.4%) stenosis in the aortic stent versus 38.9 +/- 24.1% (median, 34.0%) stenosis in the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty control segment of aorta (n = 5, p = NS) and 81.4 +/- 25.5% stenosis in the iliac artery stent versus 89.3 +/- 15.3% stenosis in the PTA control segment of the right iliac artery (n = 5, p = NS). Comparing stenotic arterial segments treated with angioplasty alone with angioplasty plus intravascular stenting in the atherosclerotic rabbits showed that there was no significant difference in either the histopathologic changes or the restenosis rates.\r"

In contrast, agents that exhibit normal use-dependent prolongation of refractoriness hold great promise: While having relatively less effects on the normal heart beat, they could induce self-termination of a tachycardia. Prolongation of refractoriness can be achieved by lengthening of action potential duration and delaying recovery of excitability. Combination of these drug actions may yield important clinical applications.\r"

Although some degree of diastolic failure exists in most patients presenting clinically with heart failure, a substantial subset of patients have relatively pure diastolic heart failure with normal systolic function. Diastolic heart failure can be due to structural abnormalities that increase resistance to ventricular inflow, and these structural abnormalities can be extramyocardial (e.g., constrictive pericarditis and mitral stenosis) or intramyocardial (e.g., fibrosis and amyloidosis). In addition to structural abnormalities, physiological derangement of myocardial inactivation and relaxation can contribute importantly to diastolic dysfunction in patients with heart failure. There is mounting evidence that advanced myocardial hypertrophy is associated with increased resistance to ventricular diastolic inflow due to both structural alteration (increased wall thickness and altered collagen matrix) and impaired diastolic relaxation of the hypertrophied myocardium. Physiological mechanisms for impaired relaxation in advanced hypertrophy remain controversial but can include disordered function of myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum, subendocardial ischemia, and altered adenylate cyclase function. Diastolic dysfunction can play an important role in the genesis of flash pulmonary edema seen in patients with ischemic heart disease because myocardial ischemia is associated with a decline in relaxation rate, increased resistance to early diastolic filling, and in some cases, a striking upward shift in the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty minutes after drug infusion (0.3-10 mg), heart rate (78 +/- 17 to 71 +/- 16 beats/min, p less than 0.0003), left ventricular systolic pressure (-9 mm Hg, p less than 0.0004), and plasma norepinephrine concentration all decreased significantly. The isovolumic indexes of inotropic state also decreased slightly (-10% in dP/dtmax, p less than 0.001), whereas the ejection fraction (39 +/- 16% to 41 +/- 16%, p less than 0.08) and the end-systolic volume (-6%, p less than 0.04) tended to improve, probably because of the afterload reduction (-13% in mean systolic wall stress, p less than 0.05). After benazeprilat administration, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was unchanged at the group level, but there was a consistent downward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation during rapid filling, and the mean diastolic wall stress decreased from 99 +/- 73 to 69 +/- 42 kdyne/cm2 (p less than 0.007). These data indicate that the acute administration of benazeprilat has a dual action on left ventricular pump function, which is that the negative inotropic effect of bradycardia and reduced sympathetic drive are compensated by afterload reduction. The drug also improved left ventricular diastolic distensibility and significantly reduced wall stress during diastole. The beneficial effects on diastolic function were noted both in patients with mild left ventricular dysfunction and in patients with heart failure.\r"

To study the effects of nicardipine on systolic and diastolic myocardial function, we used three experimental models. In isolated feline papillary muscle, nicardipine produced a dose-dependent calcium antagonistic effect manifested by depressed indexes of contraction and relaxation. In an autoregulating blood-perfused isolated rabbit heart preparation, nicardipine markedly increased coronary blood flow and slightly decreased systolic pressure at a given end-diastolic pressure. The systolic pressure and +dP/dt versus volume curves, however, were shifted to the left during nicardipine administration, indicating improved systolic function. This increase was accompanied by decreased volume elastance and is probably due, at least in part, to the coronary turgor effect. In humans at rest, intravenous nicardipine administration produced pronounced coronary and systemic vasodilation with improved left ventricular systolic performance and enhanced relaxation accompanied by reflex sympathetic activation. With exercise to ischemia, nicardipine preserved the salutary effects on left ventricular function seen at rest and significantly blunted the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure observed in the control setting. Administration of intracoronary nicardipine to patients produced a slight and transient depression of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function that was accompanied by a pronounced coronary vasodilator response and later by improved ventricular function. This improvement was manifested by decreased end-systolic volume and increased +dP/dt without changes in heart rate, arterial pressure, end-diastolic pressure, or end-diastolic volume. Global diastolic function indexes, including the time constant for isovolumic relaxation, peak filling rate normalized for stroke volume, and volume elastance, were unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left ventriculography was performed at baseline (after pretreatment with propranolol to minimize reflex changes) and was repeated after the intravenous administration of 2.5 mg nicardipine. Regional peak filling rate and time to peak filling rate were determined in eight ventricular segments before and after nicardipine. At baseline, the time from the R wave to the regional peak filling rate was 380-680 msec, and there were a large number of segments with depressed peak filling rate (p less than 0.001, vs. distribution of regional peak filling rate in normal subjects using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), indicating both asynchrony of filling (p less than 0.001, vs. distribution of time to peak filling rate in normal subjects) and nonhomogeneity of diastolic distensibility. Nicardipine administration significantly reduced the distribution of the time to peak filling rate (p less than 0.001) and increased regional peak filling rate (p less than 0.001) in a large subset of segments. Segments with normal values of peak filling rate at baseline, however, frequently did not improve or even decreased their peak filling rate. The changes in global left ventricular filling rate after drug administration also correlated with the number of segments improved after nicardipine.

  ".W": "The pericardium, because of the nature of its pressure-volume relation, can influence left ventricular diastolic and systolic pump function. During an acute increase in heart size that results in the stretching of the pericardium, the elastic properties of the pericardium restrict further cardiac dilatation and curtail the ability of the ventricles to increase stroke volume. In addition, the pericardium enhances the degree to which increments in right ventricular volume would alter left ventricular diastolic distensibility. Ventricular interdependence is enhanced as a direct consequence of pericardial elastic properties. During the heightened venous return associated with marked muscular work, we found evidence of pericardial constraint in 31 of 61 patients with heart failure of varying severity and diverse etiology. The occurrence of pericardial constraint, which was characterized by stroke volume becoming invariant and an equivalent rise in right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures as work load was raised during incremental upright exercise, was independent of the degree to which maximum oxygen consumption was reduced or, equivalently, the severity of heart failure. In contrast, when pericardial constraint was not apparent during our exercise protocol, stroke volume did not become invariant, and the increments in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were two- to threefold that of right atrial pressure. Thus, the pericardium can have a substantial role in determining the limits to left ventricular diastolic and systolic function.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular Ca2+ release and reuptake are necessary for normal contraction and relaxation of the human heart. Intracellular Ca2+ transients were recorded with aequorin during isometric contraction of myocardium from patients with end-stage heart failure. In contrast to controls, contractions and Ca2+ transients of muscles from failing hearts were markedly prolonged, and the Ca2+ transients exhibited two distinct components. Muscles from the failing hearts showed a diminished capacity to restore a low resting Ca2+ level during diastole. These data obtained in actively contracting human myocardium suggest that intracellular Ca2+ handling is abnormal and might cause both systolic and diastolic dysfunction in heart failure. The inotropic effectiveness of drugs that act to increase intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), such as beta-adrenergic agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, was markedly reduced in muscles from patients with heart failure. In contrast, the effectiveness of inotropic stimulation with drugs that act by cyclic AMP-independent mechanisms, such as the cardiotonic steroids and DPI 201-106, were preserved. Stimulation of intracellular cyclic AMP production by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin restored the inotropic response to phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These studies indicate that an abnormality in cyclic AMP production may be a fundamental defect in patients with end-stage heart failure that may markedly diminish the effectiveness of agents that depend on generation of this nucleotide for a positive inotropic effect. Moreover, deficient production of cyclic AMP seems, at least in part, to account for the reversal of the force-frequency relation that characterizes failing myocardium. Of interest, direct measurement of total cellular cyclic AMP content and protein kinase activity did not reveal significant differences between the control and myopathic tissue, suggesting the presence in human ventricular muscle of physiologically distinct compartmentalized pools of cyclic AMP. Finally, changes in the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ca2+ also seem to play an important role in the differential responsiveness to drugs of myopathic versus normal human myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The potential adverse effect of 1) electrical nonuniformity induced by right ventricular pacing and 2) mechanical nonuniformity observed in a model of stunned myocardium induced by 1 hour of severe coronary artery stenosis on left ventricular contraction and relaxation was studied in conscious dogs instrumented for long-term measurements of global and regional left ventricular function. Altering the sequence of electrical activation resulted in a significant change in contraction and relaxation predominantly through asynchrony rather than through changes in inotropy or loading conditions. In the presence of abnormal depolarization, sympathetic stimulation induced by treadmill exercise does not restore synchrony but, on the contrary, results in a significant prolongation of relaxation constant T1. During the early phase of reperfusion after 1 hour of severe coronary artery stenosis, left ventricular relaxation constant T1 is prolonged, whereas at the same time, temporal and regional asynchrony between the normal zone and the stunned zone are significantly augmented. The similarity between the time course of recovery of both global left ventricular relaxation and asynchrony suggests that asynchronous contraction, rather than regional relaxation abnormalities of the stunned myocardium, is the major cause for prolonged relaxation constant T1 during recovery from myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated in 41 heart transplant patients during acute rejection by an analysis of echocardiograms and surgically implanted intramyocardial tantalum markers. In 35 patients, isovolumic relaxation time was calculated from M-mode tracings selected from two-dimensional echocardiographic recordings. A total of 84 biopsy findings of no rejection, moderate rejection, and severe acute rejection after treatment were correlated with measurements of isovolumic relaxation time. In six patients, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and peak filling rate were obtained from biplanar cineradiographic images of intramyocardial markers. Data from 11 prerejection periods were compared with those of moderate acute rejection. All echocardiograms and marker images were analyzed without previous knowledge of biopsy findings. At times of acute rejection, isovolumic relaxation time decreased from 107 to 65 msec (p less than 0.01) and returned to 98 msec after immunosuppressive therapy. Ejection fraction and end-systolic volume did not change significantly with acute rejection, whereas stroke volume decreased from 76 to 67 ml (p less than 0.05). In contrast to the effects on systolic function, episodes of acute rejection were accompanied by a decrease in end-diastolic volume from 166 to 153 ml (p less than 0.01) and a reduction in peak filling rate from 514 to 460 ml/sec (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that acute cardiac rejection is associated with relative preservation of left ventricular systolic performance but with alterations in diastolic dynamics similar to those seen in \"restrictive\" cardiomyopathy.\r"

Ejection fraction, peak emptying, and peak filling rates, in addition to times to reach peak rates, were evaluated after constructing a global time-activity curve and its first time derivative. In addition, we computed the first time-derivative curves for each image pixel and obtained functional images (MIN/MAX images) representing the distribution of times to peak emptying or filling rates Using a left ventricular region of interest, time histograms were generated, and indexes of dispersion of times to peak rates, defined as the full width at half maximum of the histograms, were obtained. Significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) differences were observed among all groups for ejection fraction, peak emptying rate, and peak filling rate. The decrease of the peak filling rate still remained significant from group G1 to group G3 even after adjustment for differences in ejection fraction and heart rate. Peak filling rate was linearly correlated with ejection fraction in the population with ischemic heart disease (G2 + G3) (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The association between pressure overload, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and failure, and abnormalities in diastolic function has been described both clinically and experimentally. The mechanisms underlying this association, however, are complex and controversial. Factors that have been implicated include mechanical alterations due to hypertrophy alone, changes in collagen type and content, alterations in beta-adrenergic responsiveness, and chronic myocardial ischemia. Studies in our laboratory have identified limitations in subendocardial flow reserve in compensated LV hypertrophy and near exhaustion in subendocardial reserve in animals with decompensated LV hypertrophy and failure. These abnormalities in coronary reserve are associated with impaired diastolic function, particularly during periods of physiological stress. For example, with pacing-induced stress, impairment in diastolic function was observed in conscious dogs with compensated LV hypertrophy. In conscious dogs with LV hypertrophy and failure, isoproterenol also resulted in altered diastolic function. Thus, in the model of severe pressure-overload hypertrophy, which is characterized by limitations in coronary reserve, the mechanism of subendocardial ischemia might be responsible in part for the impairment in diastolic function observed in response to superimposed stress.\r"

  ".W": "Acute intravenous administration of the new beta 1-adrenergic receptor partial agonist xamoterol lowers left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and improves the isovolumic indexes of inotropic state and relaxation. To determine if these hemodynamic changes were maintained after prolonged administration, the dose-response relation to cumulative doses of xamoterol was determined in a group of 14 patients with mild (n = 6)-to-serve (n = 8) ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. These patients had been treated with xamoterol (200 mg, b.i.d.) for a mean of 51 +/- 17 months, and the drug had been stopped for 72 hours before testing the responsiveness to xamoterol. In these patients, xamoterol administration still induced dose-dependent decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 21.4 +/- 8.2 to 15.8 +/- 7.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01, vs. baseline and vs. the control data 51 +/- 17 months before). Peak positive dP/dt and dP/dt normalized to a developed pressure of 40 mm Hg [( dP/dt]/DP40) increased by 14% and 23%, respectively (p less than 0.01), whereas the rate of isovolumic pressure decrease improved by 12% (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that the myocardial response to xamoterol is maintained after years of continuous therapy, and that in patients with heart failure, this response was expressed mainly as a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.\r"

Based on 902 hospitalized patients, a mean annual incidence of 4.9 cases per 100,000 children and adults was found. Although adult patients predominated (60%), the incidence was far higher in children, 13.8 per 100,000 compared with 3.9 per 100,000 in adults. Two peaks in incidence were identified, one for the youngest children, and the second for young adults (15-29 years). Over the years the incidence varied little in adults, but decreased significantly in children over the last 6 years studied. The data presented indicate acute epiglottitis to be a more frequent disorder than previously believed but with less risk of a fatal outcome. The mortality rate was below 1% in children and adults and the annual incidence of death from acute epiglottitis was estimated at 0.5 cases per million. The primary admission of these patients to ENT units seems to be the single factor having the most powerful impact on mortality.\r"

The mean period of ventilation by Goode's tubes before removal or extrusion was 18.4 months. The tubes became infected in 70.4% and were spontaneously extruded in 44.9% of patients. Permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane ensued in 47.5% of patients and significantly more often in those aged between 10 and 20 years (P less than 0.002). Patients aged less than 10 years were significantly less likely to develop a retraction of their tympanic membranes after removal of the Goode's tube than those older (P less than 0.02). No significant relationship was found between the development of these complications and the period of ventilation, past experience of otitis media, consistency of effusion, degree of tympanosclerosis or the preoperative presence of tympanic retraction.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has become available for treatment of growth failure in uremic children. Since GH raises the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in healthy individuals, there has been concern that treatment with rhGH, by its action on glomerular hemodynamics, may adversely affect the progression of renal failure. To further address this issue, inulin clearance (enzymatic steady-state infusion technique) was measured in 7 healthy normotensive adult volunteers and 7 patients with chronic renal failure from glomerular or non-glomerular causes. Subjects were given 4.5 U bid of rhGH by s.c. injection for 3 days. In volunteers, a significant increase in Cin was noted 72 h after start of rhGH administration from 120 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range 91-158) to 133 (108-167) (p less than 0.02). In contrast, no significant increase in Cin was noted in patients with chronic renal failure (baseline Cin 21 ml/min/1.73 m2, 15-32; after rhGH 22 ml/min/1.73 m2, 15-32) despite pronounced effects of GH on S-cholesterol and urea excretion rate. The results show that stimulation of GFR by short-term administration of rhGH is obliterated in chronic renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study the possibility of abnormal differentiation and proliferation of T-cell precursors in chronic renal failure (CRF), we studied T-cell colony formation in CRF patients. The two-step monolayer method, with phytohemagglutinin-P as the inducer, was used for T-cell colony formation. In our results, colony formation was markedly reduced in CRF patients in comparison with normal controls, with about half of the former showing no colony growth. All cases showed a significant increase in colony numbers with in vitro plasmapheresis (the replacement of autologous plasma in the culture system with normal AB plasma). A significant increase in colony numbers was also seen with the addition of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). The addition of IL-2 in the presence of normal plasma, in particular, induced an increase in colony numbers to near the levels in normal subjects. These results suggest that T-cell precursors exist in near normal numbers in CRF patients and that there are uremic inhibitors in the plasma. A reduced production of IL-2 is also indicated. These factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of immunodeficiency in CRF patients.\r"

  ".W": "Some literature reports associate a reduced weekly duration of treatment (3 x 4 h/week) for patients on maintenance hemodialysis with an increased cardiovascular mortality. To determine whether the improved survival of patients on long weekly hemodialysis (LHD: 3 x 8 h/week) can be associated with different cardiac changes, the cardiac characteristics of a group of 50 patients on LHD were analyzed in a non-invasive assessment. The main findings were an increased left ventricular (LV) muscle mass (176 + 54 g/m2), mass/volume ratio (1.69 + 0.37 g/ml) and left atrial diameter (39.7 + 5.7 mm). The increase in LV muscle mass was due mainly to a high prevalence of asymmetric septal thickening. The ratio septum/LV posterior wall was directly correlated with the left atrial diameter (r = 0.52), LV end-diastolic diameters were inversely correlated with hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.62). LV dilatation and/or LV systolic dysfunction were not characteristic findings: Only 6% of patients had a moderately enlarged (less than 65 mm) LV diameter, LV ejection fraction was decreased in 12%. There was no significant correlation between the degree of LV hypertrophy or left atrial dilatation and patient age, total dialysis duration, interdialytic weight gain, hemoglobin concentration, parameters of blood purification, blood pressure before and after dialysis, history of hypertension. We conclude that cardiac characteristics in patients on LHD are comparable to those described for large patient groups on short hemodialysis. Our findings do not explain improved survival on LHD.\r"

There have been a few recently reported cases with dialysis amyloidosis in which extra-articular amyloid deposition resulted in overt clinical problems.

Dilator studies were performed in vessels preconstricted by a continuous infusion of noradrenaline. 3. In the endothelium-intact vessel the dose-response to acetylcholine was biphasic; low doses produced venodilatation with higher doses causing venoconstriction. 4. Dilatation to low doses of acetylcholine was abolished by prior irrigation with distilled water, consistent with denudation of the endothelium by this process. Irrigation augmented the constriction seen in response to higher doses of acetylcholine. 5. This is the first demonstration of an endothelium-dependent biphasic dose-response to acetylcholine in man. The results raise questions as to the possible physiological actions of endogenous acetylcholine and as to the use of the acetylcholine dose-response curve as a marker of endothelial function.\r"

  ".W": "1. There is a familial tendency to abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have followed up a previous report of a weak association between the haptoglobin 2-1 phenotype and aortic aneurysm and investigated polymorphisms of the haptoglobin gene and neighbouring cholesterol ester transfer protein gene on the long arm of chromosome 16 in patients with atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm, patients with stenosing aortic atherosclerosis and healthy control subjects. The protein polymorphism of haptoglobin results from variant alpha-chains, alpha 1 and alpha 2, the phenotype nomenclature describing the two alpha-chains. We have also investigated whether the different haptoglobin phenotypes influence the degradation of aortic connective tissue. 2. The frequency of the haptoglobin alpha 1 allele was increased in patients with aneurysms compared with healthy control subjects (0.51 versus 0.35, P less than 0.05). Patients homozygous for the alpha 2 allele had the highest mean age at aneurysm resection. The frequency of a rare polymorphism at the cholesterol ester transfer protein locus was also increased in aneurysm patients (0.15 versus 0.05 in control subjects, P less than 0.01). These two genetic markers appear to act independently. Haptoglobins containing an alpha 1-chain accelerated two- to four-fold the degradation by elastases of aortic elastin in vitro. 3. Genetic variation in the haptoglobin and cholesterol ester transfer protein genes appears to influence dilatation of the abdominal aorta. Variation at the haptoglobin locus could have a direct effect on the degradation of elastin in atherosclerotic aorta, whereas variation at the cholesterol ester transfer protein locus could affect lipid metabolism and promote atherosclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MAP duration was measured at 90% repolarization. Local conduction was measured as the delay between the pacing artefact and upstroke of the MAP. 2.

The ventilatory response to adenosine infusion varied from a 7% decrease to a 25% increase in ventilation. 4. Those patients with intact hypoxic ventilatory drive showed respiratory stimulation, whereas of the two patients with attenuated chemoreflexes, one showed no stimulation and the other depression of ventilation in response to adenosine infusion. 5. We conclude that adenosine exerts its respiratory stimulant effect via an action on the peripheral chemoreceptors. This may coexist with a centrally mediated respiratory depression that is masked when the carotid bodies are intact.\r"

Inhibition of 11 beta-dehydrogenase (e.g. after liquorice ingestion) results in cortisol acting as a potent mineralocorticoid. We have evaluated the effect of the synthetic liquorice derivative, carbenoxolone, on this enzyme complex. 2. Carbenoxolone given to six volunteers in metabolic balance produced sodium retention with suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Plasma potassium fell, although there was no kaliuresis. This was associated with inhibition of 11 beta-dehydrogenase (as measured by a rise in the plasma half-life of [11 alpha-3H]cortisol). Unlike liquorice, however, carbenoxolone also inhibited 11-oxoreductase (as measured by the generation of cortisol after oral cortisone acetate). 3. The mineralocorticoid activity of carbenoxolone, like liquorice, is mediated via cortisol by inhibition of 11 beta-dehydrogenase. Carbenoxolone, however, also inhibits 11-oxoreductase activity and this may relate to its effect on renal potassium excretion.\r"

During the pre-replicative phase of the regenerating rat liver some interesting changes occur, which might selectively modify some mechanisms involved in bile formation, such as those responsible for the hypercholeretic effect of ursodeoxycholic acid. The aim of the present work was to gain information on this point. 2. Anaesthetized male Wistar rats (approximately 250 g) were used. The animals underwent two-thirds hepatectomy 1, 6 or 12 h before collection of bile samples was begun. Very early after hepatectomy (1 h) spontaneous bile flow and bile acid output were increased. Both returned to values not significantly different from those of the controls at 6 h. Bile flow increased again at the end of the pre-replicative phase. Taurocholate infusion (200 nmol min-1 g-1 calculated liver weight) induced increases in bile flow and bile acid output that were similar in both the control and hepatectomized rats, regardless of the time of the pre-replicative phase considered. 3. Cholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid were infused (300 nmol min-1 g-1 calculated liver weight) into control and partially hepatectomized rats (at the mid-point of the pre-replicative phase, i.e. 6 h after surgical liver resection). Cholic acid-induced bile flow, bile acid and bicarbonate output expressed per g of remaining liver were similar in control and in hepatectomized rats. By contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid-induced choleresis were profoundly altered during the pre-replicative phase. As expressed per g of remaining liver, bile flow was markedly reduced (-17%, P less than 0.05), in spite of total bile acid output being greatly increased (+ 148%, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The recent development of a sensitive method allowed the demonstration of a deficit of vitamin K1 in the circulation of osteoporotic subjects. 3. Vitamin K2, namely the menaquinones of various chain-lengths, has been shown by others to be more effective than vitamin K1 in the curative rat bioassay. 4. Earlier reports had shown that the concentration of menaquinones in human liver may exceed that of vitamin K1. But previous methods were too insensitive for testing the normal circulating levels of menaquinones in the human. 5. The new sensitive method has now been applied to measuring the circulating levels of vitamin K1 and of two of the menaquinones, namely menaquinone-7 and menaquinone-8. 6. In normal individuals, the circulating levels of vitamin K1 were the same, irrespective of age. 7. In young normal subjects, the combined levels of menaquinone-7 and menaquinone-8 were at least the same as the level of vitamin K1. In elderly normal subjects, there was a marked deficit of menaquinone-8.\r"

  ".W": "1. The intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in washed human platelets was measured using the fluorescent indicator, fura-2, in a cross-sectional study of 36 normotensive, primigravid volunteers, 12 in each trimester of pregnancy and a further 12 at 6 weeks post partum. The results were compared with those obtained from 30 normal female volunteers not using oral contraception. 2. The mean basal [Ca2+]i in the platelets of the pregnant women in the first two trimesters (115.6 +/- 6.7 and 120.1 +/- 5.7 nmol/l, respectively) was not shown to differ significantly from that of normal non-pregnant volunteers (112.3 +/- 2.9 nmol/l). However, during the third trimester a significant increase in [Ca2+]i was noted (134.0 +/- 4.9 nmol/l; P less than 0.05), with a return to normal values in the post-partum period (108.2 +/- 6.1 nmol/l). 3. [Ca2+]i was also measured in the platelets of a group of 12 primigravid pregnant women in the third trimester whose pregnancies were complicated by gestational hypertension (pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia). A significant rise in basal [Ca2+]i was noted in the platelets of primigravidae whose pregnancies were complicated by pre-eclampsia (163.6 +/- 8.8 nmol/l) as compared with normotensive, third-trimester primigravidae (P less than 0.02). However, no correlation could be demonstrated between [Ca2+]i and systemic blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "1. Peripheral adrenergic responses were studied in eight obese women before and after 15 days of caloric restriction (2500 kJ/day) and in eight sex- and age-matched lean controls. 2. beta-Adrenergic sensitivity (defined as the dose of isoprenaline required to increase resting heart rate by 25 beats/min) was evaluated before and after the diet. Density and affinity (determined as the apparent dissociation constant) of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, and plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels, were measured after overnight bed-rest and after 9 min of standardized exercise performed before and after the low caloric diet. 3. Before the diet basal antecubital venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations were lower in obese women when compared with lean women (0.94 +/- 0.06 vs 1.27 +/- 0.17 nmol/l, P less than 0.02). Isoprenaline sensitivity did not differ between lean and obese women. 4. At rest, platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density was lower in overweight than in lean women (129 +/- 21 vs 168 +/- 16 fmol/mg of protein, P less than 0.02). Exercise significantly increased platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density and decreased affinity in lean women. This decrease correlated with the rise in plasma noradrenaline. 5. In obese women exercise did not modify platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density or affinity, despite a significant increase in plasma catecholamines. However, the increase in plasma noradrenaline during exercise was lower in obese women. 6. The low caloric diet produced a beta-adrenergic supersensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forearm vasodilator responses to acetylcholine, ATP and sodium nitroprusside were examined in healthy young (20 +/- 1 years, n = 9), middle-aged (46 +/- 2 years, n = 6) and old (57 +/- 1 years, n = 6) subjects. 2. A brachial artery was cannulated with a 20-gauge cannula through which drugs at graded doses were locally infused for 2 min at each dose. During drug infusions, forearm blood flow was continuously measured at 15 s intervals using a plethysmograph. Forearm vascular resistance was calculated from forearm blood flow and mean blood pressure obtained in the opposite arm. Basal forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance did not differ between the three groups. 3. Acetylcholine and ATP were used to examine endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, and sodium nitroprusside was used to examine endothelium-independent vasodilatation. All three drugs caused dose-dependent increases in forearm blood flow (P less than 0.01) and decreases in forearm vascular resistance (P less than 0.01). The increases in forearm blood flow or decreases in forearm vascular resistance in response to infusions of the three drugs did not differ between the three groups. 4. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation in forearm resistance arteries do not alter with ageing in humans.\r"

  ".W": "1. The effect of doubling doses of angiotensin II on maternal systemic blood pressure and arcuate and fetal umbilical artery Doppler velocity profiles has been investigated in 10 women in first- and 10 in second-trimester pregnancy. Ten non-pregnant women were also studied. 2. A progressive decrease in the pressor response to angiotensin II in early pregnancy as previously described was confirmed. 3. Angiotensin II induced a significant dose-dependent increase in the pulsatility index (a measure of downstream resistance) in the umbilical artery in both first- and second-trimester patients. There was an apparent increase in the threshold response of the pulsatility index to angiotensin II in the umbilical artery as pregnancy progressed. There was also a significant correlation between changes in maternal systolic or diastolic pressure and change in umbilical artery pulsatility index, but this did not differ between the two trimesters. This suggests that the increase in pulsatility index is related to blood pressure rather than angiotensin II. This is consistent with reports that angiotensin II does not cross the haemomonochorial placenta. 4. Basal pulsatility index in the arcuate artery fell with increasing gestation. There was a significant inverse association between the evoked change in maternal systemic blood pressure and the change in arcuate artery pulsatility index, suggesting local vasodilatation. 5. We conclude that acutely increasing maternal blood pressure leads to increased vascular resistance on the fetal side of the circulation.\r"
