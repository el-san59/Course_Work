  ".W": "Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) has frequently been described as a motility disorder characterized by simultaneous, high-amplitude contractions. We reviewed the results of esophageal manometry testing on a total of 1480 patients referred to our lab over 36 months. Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was determined by a mean of four station pull-through. Esophageal body motility was assessed following 10 wet swallows. In our lab a diagnosis of DES is made when greater than 10% but less than 100% of contractions are simultaneous. Manometric findings of DES were rare, with an overall prevalence of 4% (56/1480). Of the 56 patients with a manometric diagnosis of DES, high-amplitude (mean greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg) peristaltic contractions were found in only two (4%). No simultaneous contractions with amplitude greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg were seen. Pressures of simultaneous contractions were consistently lower than peristaltic contractions. A hypertensive LES pressure (greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg) was present in 5/56 DES patients (9%). Poor LES relaxation was found in 7/56 DES patients (13%). We conclude that DES is a rare manometric finding, regardless of the reason for referral, and that the occurrence of high-amplitude contractions in DES is equally rare.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is believed to be an inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. In patients with achalasia the concentration of VIP and the number of VIP-containing nerve fibers are reduced or absent. It has been suggested that the response to low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be mediated by a nonadrenergic noncholinergic pathway in which the release of VIP is responsible for the smooth muscle relaxation. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of TENS on LES pressure and on VIP plasma concentrations in six patients with achalasia (five female, one male). TENS was performed daily during one week for 45-min sessions with a pocket stimulator that delivered low-frequency pulses (6.5 Hz), at 10 pulses/sec of 0.1-msec duration at intensities of 10-20 mA until rhythmic flexion of the fingers was obtained without producing pain. LES pressure and VIP levels were obtained before TENS, after the first 45-min session, and after a week of daily stimulation. After 45-min, TENS produced a significant reduction (P less than 0.01) in LES resting pressure from the mean value 56 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 42.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg; with LES relaxation improvement from 50.6 +/- 3% to 63.1 +/- 3.2% (P less than 0.01). After one week of daily TENS, an additional reduction in LES resting pressure (40.3 +/- 4 mm Hg) was observed (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Esophageal motility and pH were recorded concurrently before and after a standard meal. In the patients with symptomatic reflux, the meal induced a four- to sevenfold increase in the gastroesophageal reflux through two mechanisms: a four- to fivefold increase in the rate of transient LES relaxations and an increase in the proportion of transient LES relaxations accompanied by reflux from 47% to 68%. Overall the rate of reflux episodes that occurred by mechanisms other than transient LES relaxation did not increase significantly. An exception to these findings were those in six patients with chronically absent basal LES pressure in whom transient LES relaxations could not be scored. In these patients, reflux increased postprandially through mechanisms other than transient LES relaxation. These findings confirm the pivotal importance of transient LES relaxations in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy exists over whether diazepam can be used for sedation during esophageal manometry studies without affecting the results. To evaluate the effect of diazepam, 20 healthy asymptomatic volunteers were studied using a standard manometry protocol employing an Arndorfer capillary infusion system. Following a baseline manometry, each subject received 0.1 mg/kg diazepam intravenously over 1 min and underwent repeat manometry 5 min after completion of the injection. All manometry recordings were coded and read blindly. The amplitude of the lower esophageal sphincter was significantly reduced by diazepam from 26.2 +/- 10.9 and 30.0 +/- 10.9 mm Hg to 18.8 +/- 7.6 and 24.5 +/- 9.7 mm Hg by rapid and station pull-through methods, respectively (P less than 0.01 both methods). Esophageal contraction wave duration was significantly increased following diazepam at 3, 8, and 13 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (P less than 0.01 all levels). There was a trend toward increased contraction wave amplitude following diazepam administration in the lower three fourths of the esophagus. On the basis of these results, we conclude that diazepam sedation may produce misleading results when used during esophageal manometric testing. It is recommended that diazepam not be used in manometric studies of normal subjects or patients with reflux esophagitis and that manometric findings in patients with hypertensive or spastic disorders be interpreted with caution if diazepam is given as a premedication.\r"

No differences were observed between the groups (P greater than 0.3). No change in hysteresis was observed in either group. The group with esophageal varices had significantly higher collagen content in the distal esophagus when compared to controls (P less than 0.05). No difference was demonstrated in the proximal part. No correlation was demonstrated between the collagen content and esophageal compliance.

  ".W": "Possible differences in the abilities of esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter muscles to utilize substrates to support agonist-induced contractions were studied. Strips of longitudinal, circular, and lower esophageal sphincter muscle from the opossum esophagus were first contracted to approximately 70% of the maximal contraction elicited by acetylcholine, histamine, or substance P. The tissues were then exhausted by exposure to 5 x 10(-4) M carbachol and a 15% O2-5% CO2-80% N2 gas mixture for 90 min. They were next reequilibrated with one of a number of alternative substrates and 95% O2-5% CO2 for 3 hr. Responses to the initial agonist doses were again noted and compared to controls. The alternative substrates were: 2-deoxyglucose, glucose, fructose 1-6 diphosphate, pyruvate, lactate, acetate, butyrate, caprylate, histidine, leucine, aspartate, alanine, succinate, acetoacetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. The results obtained show qualitative differences in the ability of the three muscle types to use these substrates. More importantly, however, the ability of any one substrate to support contractions was a function of the agonist used to stimulate the muscle. The evidence suggests, therefore, that not all pharmacologic receptors have equal access to intracellular energy sources.\r"

No structural abnormalities of gastrointestinal tract and organic disorders were detected in the patients. In a high proportion of both groups of patients we found manometric abnormalities of interdigestive and fed motor patterns that were not seen in the controls: absence of antral phase III of MMC; significant decrease of antral and/or duodenal motor activity during fasting and/or fed periods; abnormal propagation or configuration of MMC phase III that was significantly shorter than in controls; bursts of sustained fasting and/or fed phasic duodenal activity, frequently uncoordinated with adjacent gut segments. When compared to controls, the mean intragastric concentration of bile salts during all MMC phases and the mean 1-hr percent gastric activity of the radiolabeled milk were significantly higher in the two groups of patients. We conclude that in a high proportion of children with nonulcer dyspepsia and of children with GER disease, gastrointestinal manometry may reveal significant irregularities of antral and duodenal motility, which are associated with increased duodenogastric reflux and delayed gastric emptying.\r"

The H+ output over 6 hr with vagotomy by chemoneurolysis (10.5 +/- 0.7 mumol, mean +/- SEM, N = 10) or truncal vagotomy and chemoneurolysis (10.9 +/- 1.1 mumol, mean +/- SEM, N = 10) was similar to that with transection vagotomy, but significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than that with truncal vagotomy by chemoneurolysis (17.9 +/- 1.1 mumol, N = 10). The latter output was similar to that of truncal vagotomy performed surgically (18.2 +/- 1.3 mumol, N = 10). Reserpine (0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneal) stimulated gastric acid secretion relative to control values (207 +/- 3.1 mumol vs 67 +/- 3.2 mumol, N = 10, P less than 0.001) and transection vagotomy, vagotomy by chemoneurolysis, or truncal vagotomy and chemoneurolysis were more effective (P less than 0.01) than truncal vagotomy performed surgically or by chemoneurolysis in preventing this stimulation. Insulin stimulated the H+ output (184 +/- 2.9 mumol vs 62 +/- 3.1 mumol, N = 10, P less than 0.001) and transection vagotomy, vagotomy by chemoneurolysis, or truncal vagotomy and chemoneurolysis were more effective (P less than 0.01) than truncal vagotomy done surgically or by chemoneurolysis in preventing this action. These results were reproducible in experiments done after three months. This investigation shows that transection vagotomy, vagotomy by chemoneurolysis, and truncal vagotomy plus chemoneurolysis are equally effective in achieving vagal denervation of the rat stomach and are superior in this respect to truncal vagotomy done surgically or by chemoneurolysis.\r"

The results from India were compared to studies from other parts of the world. Two hundred thirty-eight individuals ages 3 to 70 participated. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age (P less than 0.01) and was greater than 80% by age 20. H. pylori infection was present in 79% of the population studied; there was no gender-related difference in prevalence of H. pylori infection. IgG antibody against hepatitis A (HAV) was rapidly acquired in Hyderabad; in a subset of 58 children between the ages of 3 and 21 tested, the frequency of anti-HAV was 98.2%. The prevalence of H. pylori infection increases with age in both developed and developing countries. The high age-specific prevalence of H. pylori infection in developing countries is probably a reflection of the lower socioeconomic level of those areas.\r"

High gastric ammonia and low urea in Helicobacter-positive patients, and the converse in Helicobacter-negative subjects, were observed. There was a significant correlation between gastric ammonia and interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration (P less than 0.05), suggesting a causal link. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori was associated with a decrease of ammonia and an increase of urea (P less than 0.01). The significant correlation between the severity of gastric inflammation and the gastric juice ammonia concentration suggests that ammonia may play a pathogenic role in Helicobacter-associated gastric injury.\r"

No abnormalities were found during the filling phase of the gallbladder but seven of the 10 patients showed a 50% reduction in the ejection fraction (39.4% +/- 30.4 vs 80.3 +/- 8.3 of controls, mean +/- SD, P = 0.007) and a slower than normal ejection phase (9.1%/min +/- 6.6 vs 18.1 +/- 4.5, P = 0.02. In eight of the 10 patients, gastric liquid emptying was accelerated with a T1/2 of 41.5 min +/- 15.4 vs 74.7 min +/- 11.5 in the controls (P = 0.007). It is concluded that in some achalasia patients extraesophageal functional abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract may be found. Whether these findings are promoted by degenerative charges of extraesophageal nerve fibers as well as their clinical significance require further investigations.\r"

Other factors, namely cirrhosis, inflammation, alcohol intake, and viral superinfections, could promote the oncogenetic process induced by HBV-DNA integration. We studied the impact of HDV infection in the pathogenesis of HCC in 62 consecutive patients. Their mean age was 59 years (range 25-75 years), 54 were male and eight female; 58 had cirrhosis. The findings suggest that HBsAg-positive patients with HDV superinfection developed cirrhosis and HCC at an earlier age than HBsAg carriers without HDV infection. HDV appears to represent a \"promotion\" factor for HCC in subjects with an oncogenic risk induced by HBV. A long-lasting necroinflammatory lesion of the liver substained by productive HBV and HDV infections may be a major pathogenetic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the epidemiological evidence of a correlation between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma, some of the results of experimental and clinical studies remain controversial. Apart from inducing cirrhosis, which may be viewed as a precancerous liver lesion, ethanol may act as a cocarcinogen. Most investigations on this topic have focused on two aspects: ethanol's capacity to induce the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal biotransformation system and its interference with at least one DNA repair mechanism. Ethanol exposure enhances the capacity of mixed function oxidases to activate many chemical carcinogens, such as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). On the other hand, ethanol exposure fails to influence DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis. The capacity of alcohol to inhibit DMN-demethylase activity has not been clearly demonstrated in experiments carried out with human tissue. In conclusion, both the effects of ethanol and their underlying mechanisms as regards liver carcinogenesis are open to debate. The link between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be mediated mainly by its capacity to induce cirrhosis.\r"

Two of the three with cirrhosis were HBsAg positive at the time their HCC was detected. The remaining case had seroconverted to HBsAb but HBV-DNA integration could be demonstrated in the absence of cirrhosis; moreover HBV antigens were not expressed in the tissue of this case. The interval between HBV infection and HCC appearance in these three cases ranged from six to 11 years. A similarity between these three Italian cases and the majority of HCC arising in chronically infected children in the Far East is noted.\r"

Histologic examination of the myenteric plexus using the sections taken along the longitudinal axis of the intestine, stained with silver by the Smith technique, disclosed decreased numbers of argyrophilic neurons and degeneration of neurons and axons; however, there was no reactive increase in the number of glial cell nuclei. The patient's mother had suffered from chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, which did not abate following extensive small bowel resection. This is the third family reported with an autosomal dominant enteric neuropathy unassociated with evidence of extrinsic autonomic or peripheral neuropathy. Subtotal resection of the small bowel was followed by recurrence of the pseudoobstruction syndrome in both affected members of the family.\r"

Despite these difficulties, treatment is an important part of reducing morbidity and mortality from vascular events.

The baseline cohort included 7028 men, 6093 who had a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of plasma insulin and glucose levels (0 and 2 h) and 125 who were known non-insulin-treated diabetic patients. After a mean follow-up of 11 yr, 126 deaths ascribed to CHD were reported. Major independent predictors of CHD death were blood pressure, smoking, plasma cholesterol level, and fasting and 2-h postload plasma insulin level. Impairment of glucose tolerance, including overt diabetes, did not rank as an independent predictor when other baseline variables were accounted for. In the subset of the baseline cohort who presented with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (n = 943), 26 died from CHD during the follow-up. The strongest independent predictor of subsequent CHD death in this subsample with abnormal glucose tolerance was plasma triglyceride level. In view of the accumulating evidence that hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia generally occur in the same type of subjects, in relation to insulin resistance and central obesity, the epidemiological findings of the Paris Prospective Study and of other investigations support the hypothesis that a constellation of mild metabolic abnormalities may play a deleterious role with regard to cardiovascular disease risk.\r"

  ".U": "91323228\r", 
  ".W": "The association of obesity with hypertension has been amply demonstrated in cross-sectional, longitudinal, and dietary-intervention studies, but the mechanisms remain enigmatic. Both conditions are independently characterized by similar metabolic alterations, i.e., glucose intolerance, dyslipoproteinemia, elevated serum uric acid, and inadequate Na+ transport. Obesity, hypertension, and these metabolic alterations are associated with hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance. The degree of these alterations is lowest in lean hypertensives, intermediate in obese normotensives, and greatest in obese hypertensives, but mortality risk is highest in lean hypertensives. This apparent discrepancy may be related to the divergent hemodynamic characteristics, possibly indicating different etiology, of lean and obese hypertensives, i.e., contracted blood volume, increased total vascular peripheral resistance, and normal sympathetic drive in the former, expanded blood volume, normal peripheral resistance, and increased sympathetic drive in the latter. Current knowledge suggests that the interrelationships of obesity and hypertension with the metabolic alterations could be mediated by high carbohydrate and fat consumption and low physical activity, resulting in obesity and separate pathways in hyperinsulinemia and increased sympathetic drive, leading to a double vicious cycle. In one, hyperinsulinemia and the consequent insulin resistance would compound one another. In the second, the increasing hyperinsulinemia would increasingly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This double vicious cycle could result in increasing hemodynamic and metabolic derangements causing hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The association of lean hypertension with ASCVD may be through other mechanisms, e.g., hemodynamic forces on the vascular endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "There is a close association of obesity with hypertension through mechanisms not now understood. Hypertension occurs frequently in industrialized societies where weight gain with advancing years is a common feature and is rare in primitive societies where weight and age are negatively correlated. Hemodynamically, obesity is characterized by an expanded blood volume and increased cardiac output. Hypertension results if/when systemic vascular resistance fails to decrease as cardiac output increases. When calorie restriction leads to weight loss, both blood volume and cardiac output decrease; when the blood pressure falls, this is because peripheral resistance is unchanged. Weight-loss programs are helpful for the obese hypertensive because when hypertension is mild, blood pressure often (but not always) normalizes. Also, weight loss has been shown to decrease antihypertensive drug requirements. Interest in obesity-associated hypertension focuses on hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance as causative factors. Although the evidence is tempting, it is far from conclusive and it seems likely that the mechanism of this type of hypertension is as multifactorial as those of other types.\r"

  ".W": "Data suggest a critical role for Ca metabolism in the pathophysiology of hypertensive disease. Intracellularly, all hypertension displays elevated cytosolic free-Ca2+ and suppressed free-Mg2+ levels. Extracellularly, however, heterogeneous defects in Ca and Mg metabolism are observed. This apparent divergence may be explained by considering all hypertension as the expression, in varying degrees, of two underlying Ca-related mechanisms: one (salt sensitive, low renin, Ca(2+)-antagonist sensitive) dependent on inappropriate cellular Ca2+ uptake from the extracellular space and the other (salt insensitive, renin dependent, Ca(2+)-antagonist insensitive) dependent on increased cellular Ca2+ release from intracellular sites. Recent work highlights the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and the newly described parathyroid hypertensive factor in volume-dependent low-renin forms of hypertension. Altered cellular ion handling may also explain metabolic and clinical correlates of hypertension, e.g., peripheral insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Thus, all subjects with NIDDM, whether hypertensive or not, display the same elevated cytosolic free-Ca2+ and suppressed free-Mg2+ levels observed in hypertension. Furthermore, adiposity, the level of blood pressure, and fasting and postglucose hyperinsulinemia are all closely and quantitatively related to intracellular free-Ca2+, free-Mg2+, and pH levels. This suggests a broader hypothesis, in which hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, and NIDDM, each usually considered a distinct clinical entity, represent different clinical expressions of a common defect in cellular ion handling, hence explaining their frequent clinical coexistence in the general population.\r"

  ".U": "91323231\r", 
  ".W": "The Na(+)-H+ exchanger is a ubiquitous transport system that is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell growth and proliferation, cell volume regulation, and transepithelial absorption of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3-. Altered activity of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger has been implicated as a mechanism contributing to the development of high blood pressure in subgroups of patients with essential hypertension and in various animal models of hypertension. Many of these studies measured Na(+)-Li+ exchange rather than Na(+)-H+ exchange, hypothesizing that Na(+)-Li+ exchange represents a functional mode of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. However, this is a controversial assumption. Several studies have also shown an association between erythrocyte Na(+)-Li(+)-exchange rate and predisposition to nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The recent cDNA cloning of at least one isoform of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger will help clarify the cellular mechanisms of regulation of the exchanger and its possible role in pathophysiological states such as hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "91323764\r", 
  ".W": "The Bernstein test has been used as a test of oesophageal acid sensitivity for over 30 years but its clinical value has been challenged by the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring. Furthermore, the relation between mucosal acid sensitivity, symptomatic reflux, and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time is unclear. This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn. Symptomatic reflux was defined as a greater than or equal to 50% temporal association between pain episodes and reflux events (pH less than 4) during pH monitoring. A positive acid perfusion test (in which the patient's usual symptoms were evoked by acid, though not saline) had a 100% sensitivity, 73% specificity, and 81% accuracy for the detection of symptomatic reflux. All 10 patients with symptomatic reflux during pH monitoring had evidence of mucosal acid sensitivity. A negative acid perfusion test made symptomatic reflux unlikely. However, symptomatic reflux or a positive acid perfusion test, or both, were found in some patients with a normal oesophageal acid exposure time during pH monitoring. Mucosal acid sensitivity, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time, and symptomatic reflux should be regarded as separate, though related aspects of reflux disease. The Bernstein test is simple, safe, and easily performed. A positive test helps to identify an oesophageal cause of symptoms, particularly in patients in whom other aspects of 'gastro-oesophageal reflux disease' are absent, or who do not have symptoms during pH monitoring.\r"

Simultaneous oesophageal manometry and pH studies were performed on two separate days in each subject in the fasting and postprandial periods. The frequency of reflux tended to be higher in the upright position. The most prevalent mechanism of reflux in either position was transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. The frequency of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation was higher in the upright than in the supine position. There was no difference in the total reflux time, acid clearance time, and number of reflux episodes lasting longer than five minutes in the two positions. We suggest that daytime reflux (upright) may be as important as night time (supine) reflux in the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis and needs to be considered when treating patients with reflux disease.\r"

The scanning and transmission electron microscopic findings show bacteria which invade and damage gastric mucosal cells. These organisms are similar to the spiral shaped bacteria found in the stomachs of cats and dogs and non-human primates. In eight patients organisms were not detected after four weeks of treatment with bismuth salts. The disappearance of the organisms coincided with resolution of the chronic active gastritis and the symptoms.\r"

Ninety four per cent of abnormalities in frequency were detected by visual analysis and 93.7% by computer analysis. Abnormalities involving a loss of coupling, however, were not recognised by transcutaneous recordings. Transcutaneous recordings of gastric electrical activity assessed by computer analysis can usually recognise normal gastric electrical activity and tachygastria. Current techniques, however, are unable to detect abnormalities in electrical coupling.\r"

Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment.\r"

Patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children over the three years (1984-7) with diarrhoea and EPEC infection were reviewed. Clinical details, features of small intestinal mucosa, and treatment were recorded in those who developed chronic diarrhoea with failure to thrive. Twenty six children with EPEC required hospital admission for diarrhoea and six of these (23%) developed chronic diarrhoea. In contrast only two (5%) of 42 with other serogroups of E coli (p less than 0.01) and 28 (4%) of 764 children without EPEC admitted with acute diarrhoea developed chronic symptoms (p less than 0.01). EPEC serogroups detected in the stool of the six children with chronic diarrhoea were 0128 in three, 0114 in two, and 0119 in one. The patients' clinical characteristics were: previous good health, no significant immunodeficiency, age 4-10 months, foreign travel (three of six), severe life threatening secretory diarrhoea from 0.5 to 1.5 1 per day (four of six), small intestinal enteropathy (five of six) three of whom showed mucosal adherent, non-invasive E coli of the same serotype as that in the stool, in association with microvillous loss and pedestal formation. All were treated with hypoallergenic feeds, two with parenteral nutrition, and three with parenteral antibiotics. All eventually recovered. EPEC infection is a common treatable cause of life threatening chronic diarrhoea in infancy.\r"

Cytotoxic anticolon antibody was present in 20% overall and was strongly associated with disease activity; it did not correlate with the presence of 'classical' anticolon antibody.

At trial entry each patient underwent a rectal biopsy and sections were graded independently by two histopathologists. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of varying severity was present in all biopsy specimens, and 58% had crypt architectural irregularities. In addition, 32% had evidence of acute inflammatory activity: 28% acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, 11% crypt abscesses, and 22% mucin depletion. Agreement between the two histopathologists for the presence of each of these features was 94% (90-98%). During the 12 month follow up 27 patients (33%) relapsed after a mean interval of 18 weeks (range 3-44 weeks). Relapse rates were unrelated to duration or extent of disease or to the type of maintenance drug treatment. In patients with an acute inflammatory cell infiltrate 52% relapsed, whereas in the absence of such an infiltrate only 25% relapsed (p = 0.02). Similarly, relapse rates were higher in the presence of crypt abscesses (78% v 27%, p less than 0.005), mucin depletion (56% v p less than 0.02), and breaches in the surface epithelium (75% v 31%, p = 0.1). The presence of a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate or crypt architectural irregularities, however, bore no relation to the frequency of colitis relapse.\r"

Fifty two consecutive patients with active ulcerative colitis each ingested 10 radio-opaque markers nightly for 14 days. Minimum colonic transit times were derived from counts of retained markers shown by plain abdominal radiography on the 15th day. The transit times for each patient were related to their disease extent and bowel frequency. Four patients had colonic transit times greater than one week and two others had evidence of relative stasis. The results indicate that approximately 10% of attacks of distal colitis are associated with faecal stasis.\r"

  ".W": "Morphometric measurements were performed on rectal biopsy specimens from 10 normal control subjects and 33 patients with a relapse of distal ulcerative colitis before and after treatment for four weeks in a double blind controlled trial with oral eudragit S coated 5 amino salicylic acid (n = 12) or rectal prednisolone enemas (n = 15). Measurements were assessed using a computer aided measuring system and a counting technique. When untreated patients were compared with the control group there were significant decreases in the area and height of the surface epithelium, in the area of crypt epithelium, and in the ratios of goblet cells to epithelial cells and of surface epithelium to lamina propria. The vascular and lamina propria areas and the number of intraepithelial polymorphs were increased. Treatment with 5 amino salicylic acid and corticosteroids resulted in similar morphological improvements: there was an increase in the area and height of the surface epithelium and the ratios of surface epithelium to lamina propria and of surface to crypt cell height. The ratio of goblet cells to epithelial cells also increased after treatment, while the numbers of polymorphs in the surface and crypt epithelium and lumen decreased. In conclusion, computerised morphometry is valuable for the assessment of the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis and that in the doses used both treatments were of similar efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "The value of the bipolar electrocoagulator in the haemostasis of bleeding ulcers is controversial. We have therefore investigated the effect of different coagulation times on vessel weld strength achieved by the bipolar device. Welds were then made in vessels of known diameter using a standard 10F endoscopic haemostatic probe at coagulation times of two and 20 seconds. The intravascular temperature achieved at each time was measured. Vessel weld strength achieved by bipolar electrocoagulation was much greater at 20 seconds (approximately twice that at two seconds) and was highly significantly greater at all vessel diameters. There was a gradual reduction in weld strength with increasing vessel diameter, an effect that was seen for both two and 20 seconds of electrocoagulation. Intravascular temperature was significantly higher at 20 seconds than at two seconds. We conclude that vessel weld strength is related to coagulation time and that any future studies comparing the bipolar electrocoagulator with other haemostatic devices should use longer periods of bipolar electrocoagulation and record the coagulation time in order to optimise the clinical value of the device.\r"

The aims of this study were to determine if normal colonic epithelial cells have uPA activity and whether this is concentrated at the cell membrane. In addition, the contribution of colonic epithelial cell associated uPA activity to disease related pertubations of mucosal uPA activity were examined. A highly enriched population of colonic epithelial cells was isolated from resected colon or biopsy specimens by an enzymatic technique. uPA activity was measured in cell homogenates by a specific and sensitive colorimetric method and expressed relative to cellular DNA. In two experiments subcellular fractionation of colonic epithelial cells was performed by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation over a linear sucrose gradient. The fractions collected were analysed for uPA and organelle-specific enzyme activities. Normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity (mean (SEM) 5.6 (1.1) IU/mg, n = 18). This colocalised with fractions enriched for leucine-beta-naphthylamidase and 5'-nucleotidase, markers of plasma membrane. uPA activities in epithelial cells from cancerous colons (9.8 (3.1) n = 7) or from mucosa affected by inflammatory bowel disease (3.8 (0.7) n = 15) were not significantly different from normal (paired t test), while that in epithelial cells from greatly inflamed mucosa was similar to that from autologous normal or mildly inflamed areas (4.4 (1.2) v 5.9 (3.6), n = 9). Thus normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity which is concentrated on the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of uPA receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The binding of Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA) isolectins L4 and E4 to the brush border membrane of differentiated Caco-2 cells was studied and the impact on cellular metabolism and microvilli was assessed. Computer analysis of the data based on binding experiments with peroxidase conjugated isolectins gave mean (SD) values for maximal binding of 2540 (151).10(-9) M for PHA-L4 and 2104 (140).10(-9) M for PHA-E4 per mg of brush border membrane protein. The dissociation constants for L4 and E4 binding were 4.3 (1.4).10(-6) M and 1.1 (0.8).10(-6) M, respectively. Incubation of differentiated Caco-2 cells for 30 minutes with ferritin conjugated PHA isolectins showed that, as indicated by the number of ferritin particles, PHA-E4 bound to the microvilli to a greater extent than PHA-L4. Ferritin particles were also localised intracellularly over endocytotic invaginations and vesicles. After incubation for 48 hours with PHA-L4 or PHA-E4, the relative incorporation of precursors for DNA, RNA, and (glyco)protein synthesis into the trichloroacetic acid insoluble fraction of the Caco-2 cells was determined. Both isolectins stimulated the incorporation of thymidine and glucosamine, but neither PHA-L4 nor PHA-E4 were able to influence the incorporation of uridine. With respect to fucose, methionine, and N-acetyl mannosamine, the stimulatory effect remained confined to PHA-E4. Since PHA-L4 and PHA-E4 were tested at the same concentrations, PHA-E4 is more effective than PHA-L4. The changes in the uptake of radioactive precursors were lost after heat inactivation of PHA-E4. Compared with control and PHA-L4 incubated Caco-2 cells, the microvilli of PHA-E4 incubated cells were shortened significantly (p less than 0.01).\r"

  ".W": "Amenorrhoea is common in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease, but little is known about its causes or consequences. We investigated 12 young women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease and amenorrhoea and compared them with 11 healthy age matched controls studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. None of the patients had raised serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone suggesting primary gonadal failure, but the variance in serum concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol, prolactin, and luteinising hormone were significantly greater in chronic liver disease patients than control subjects (p less than 0.01). Seven of the 12 chronic liver disease patients had low serum luteinising hormone concentrations, and compared with controls these patients also had significantly reduced median values of oestradiol (64 pmol/l), testosterone (1.1 nmol/l), and follicle stimulating hormone, and were significantly underweight as assessed by skinfold thickness measurements (all comparisons p less than 0.025). In the group with chronic liver disease skinfold thickness was significantly correlated with serum luteinising hormone (p less than 0.02). The five patients with normal serum luteinising hormone had higher median values of both oestradiol (237 pmol/l) and testosterone (3.0 nmol/l) than the control subjects (oestradiol: 113 pmol/l, testosterone: 1.9 nmol/l) but were not more obese or hirsute. Amenorrhoea was unrelated to the duration or severity of liver disease. The metacarpal cortical bone area (an index of bone density) was inversely related to the duration of amenorrhoea (p less than 0.02). We conclude that amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease arises from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and can occur at any stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hepatic tissue iron index proposed by Bassett et al was evaluated in 35 patients with homozygous genetic haemochromatosis, 67 patients with alcoholic liver disease, and 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease with and without cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis hepatic tissue iron concentration reliably differentiated alcoholic liver disease from genetic haemochromatosis. Although mean iron concentration was greater in patients with prefibrotic haemochromatosis than in those with prefibrotic alcoholic liver disease, some overlap occurred and complete differentiation of the two conditions was not possible. This overlap was particularly evident in some young patients with haemochromatosis in whom the tissue iron concentration grade fell in the range commonly seen in alcoholic haemosiderosis. Inability to differentiate early genetic haemochromatosis from alcoholic liver disease complicated by haemosiderosis was also a problem with standard Perls's staining. When the hepatic tissue iron index was calculated (hepatic tissue iron concentration/patient's age in years), clear differentiation of genetic haemochromatosis from both alcoholic liver disease and other forms of chronic liver disease was obtained in both cirrhotic and precirrhotic patients. This study confirms that the hepatic tissue iron index is a useful means of differentiating patients with genetic haemochromatosis from those with alcoholic liver disease. We suggest that biochemical estimation of tissue iron concentration and calculation of the tissue iron index in all patients in whom genetic haemochromatosis is a possible diagnosis will reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosing this as alcoholic liver disease.\r"

In this study we compared the in vitro dissolving capacity of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), mono-octanoin, limonene, and limonene/mono-octanoin (70%/30%). From nine sets of five human gall stones obtained at cholecystectomy, four stones were used for dissolution and the fifth was used for chemical analysis of cholesterol, calcium, and bilirubin contents. Eight sets were cholesterol stones with a mean (SD) cholesterol content of 89.9 (5.6)%. These stones dissolved completely in either solvent, often leaving sand-like debris, with the exception of one stone. MTBE dissolved cholesterol gall stones 100 times faster than mono-octanoin and 10 times faster than limonene or the limonene/mono-octanoin mixture (p less than 0.001). The combination of limonene and mono-octanoin was as effective as limonene alone. Of the four solvents, MTBE is the best one to evaluate for dissolution of residual fragments after ESWL treatment of gall bladder stones.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the role of cholecystokinin in pancreatic enzyme secretion stimulated by bombesin and a meal by (a) comparing the pancreatic enzyme output during bombesin infusion and after a meal to output during caerulein infusion and (b) comparing the inhibitory effect of the cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist lorglumide (CR-1409) on enzyme output in response to bombesin and food with the response to caerulein. Bombesin (90 pmol/kg per h) and caerulein (30 pmol/kg per h) were infused into seven dogs in doses giving similar plasma cholecystokinin peak increments as a meal (mean (SEM) 6.8 (0.8), 6.3 (1.2), and 5.7 (0.8) pM, respectively), together with either saline or 2 mg/kg per h of lorglumide. A background infusion of synthetic secretin 20.5 pmol/kg per h was given in each experiment. In addition, gastric acid secretion was determined in the experiments with bombesin and caerulein infusion. Pancreatic protein responses to bombesin (1231 (247) mg/h) and food (1430 (220) mg/h) were similar to the responses to caerulein (1249 (201) mg/h). Lorglumide inhibited pancreatic protein output during stimulation with bombesin by 60%, after the meal by 45%, and during caerulein infusion by 68%. Pancreatic bicarbonate output by bombesin, caerulein, and food was inhibited by lorglumide by 28%, 40%, and 38%, respectively. In contrast, lorglumide significantly increased gastric acid secretion from 1.12 to 7.98 mmol/h during bombesin infusion and from 0.52 to 7.62 mmol/h during caerulein infusion. In conclusion, cholecystokinin plays an important part in the stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion by bombesin and a meal in conscious dogs and it is involved in the regulation of gastric acid during stimulation by infusions of caerulein and bombesin.\r"

Furthermore, portal hypertension is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with hepatic amyloidosis.\r"

In technique success, the sighted diabetics out did the blind and the non-diabetics, long term. Short term, the blind performed better than sighted diabetics. The key to success and longer survival on CAPD depended on motivation on the part of the patient, patient's acceptance of given disability, family (social) support, and willingness on the part of renal care personnel to train the disabled diabetic to perform CAPD. With adequate education and support, blind diabetics did CAPD as well as sighted patients. There was no increased frequency of peritonitis in blind diabetics compared to sighted diabetics. Both blind diabetics and non-diabetics had fewer episodes than sighted diabetics. Intraperitoneal route of insulin administration achieved good glycemic control in diabetic population. Refractory congestive cardiac failure and/or fatal arrhythmias was the most common cardiac cause of death in diabetics on CAPD.\r"

Deterioration of end organ function may be taken as a second factor indicating the need for mechanical support as patients with acute onset of shock may react differently from patients with chronic deterioration. Preoperative need for dialysis largely reduces the chances of long-term survival. The time on support should be long enough to normalize or at least improve secondarily damaged organ systems, but with time infectious and thromboembolic complications will increase. So optimal periods for artificial heart support range between two days and four weeks. Age less than 40 years is a positive predictor for outcome in TAH bridging. The general guidelines, however, do not preclude a favourable outcome in complicated cases, as we show in our own series.\r"

The time of mechanical support ranged from 2 to 60 days, for a mean of 19.2 days. Twenty-three patients received heart transplants, with 74% 30-day survival and 52% long-term survival. Implantation of a mechanical support system became indicated in those patients whose hemodynamic and clinical condition deteriorated despite treatment with enoximone in addition to maximal sympathomimetic medication. The strategy to administer enoximone routinely was the result of a prospective study on 24 pretransplant patients in whom enoximone therapy reduced the need for mechanical assistance by 62%. At the time of device implantation shock-related organ impairment such as cerebral, renal, hepatic, and respiratory dysfunction was present in 62% of patients. In addition, 7 patients had pneumonia. During mechanical support complete recovery of end-organ failure and resolution of pneumonia was observed in the majority of patients. The results indicate that end-organ dysfunction per se should not be considered a contraindication to mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. However, further clinical investigations are needed to identify predictive indicators of irreversible organ damage.\r"

Comparing patients successfully transplanted (n = 20) or weaned (n = 9) who survived initial hospitalization, and those who died on mechanical support, there were no differences in preoperative renal, hepatic or pulmonary functions. Postoperative urinary output and bilirubin levels were the earliest variables affecting survival, and urinary output 24 hours after implant was discriminative in patients who survived (p less than 0.01). Age (above or below 40 years) and modality of terminal heart failure (acute versus chronic) were the most important factors affecting survival in the bridge to transplant group: 82% of young patients with acute decompensation were transplanted and 63% are long-term survivors while all patients over 40 years with chronic heart failure died on mechanical support (MS). In postcardiotomy patients, duration of cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was significantly different comparing survivors with those who died in either bridge or recovery groups and all patients who had a CPB greater than 4 hours died on MS or after transplantation or weaning. In conclusion, preoperative indices indicating reversibility of multiple organ dysfunction remain to be identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This paper reports on two patients implanted with a Jarvik - 70 cc TAH, who died after 1 and 3 days, both with an irreversible drop of SVR related to a complete loss of vascular tone but not related to sepsis. Activation of multiple cascades of inflammation, triggered by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), is maintained during TAH support.

  ".W": "The aim of the project was to develop laboratory test devices for studies of the cinematics and sticking behaviour of technical valve protheses. The second step includes testing technical valves of different types and sizes under static and dynamic conditions. A force-deflection balance was developed in order to load valve rims by static radial forces until sticking or loss of a disc (sticking- and clamping-mould point) with computer-controlled force deflection curves. A second deflection device was developed and used for prosthetic valves in the aortic position of a pulsatile mock circulation loop with simultaneous video-cinematography. The stiffness of technical valve rims varied between 0.20 (St. Jude) and about 1.0 N/micron (metal rim valves). The stiffness decreased significantly with increasing valve size. Sticking under pulsatile flow conditions was in good agreement with the static deflection measurements. Hence, valve sticking with increasing danger of thrombus formation is more likely with a less stiff valve rim. In the case of forces acting perpendicularly to the pendulum axis, the clamping mould-point of the valve can be reached, followed by disc dislodgement.\r"

The PU-FBNG material was processed through a spraying, phase-inversion technique to fabricate porous tubular conduits. FBNG was subsequently converted into covalently cross-linked fibrin (FBN) through the action of thrombin (Th), fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF), and calcium ions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the cross-linked blend was more stable than native cross-linked FBN. Tensile behaviors of the PU-FBN materials closely matched those of a natural artery on varying the ratio PU/FBN. Implantation experiments in the rat model showed a mature internal capsule and good tissue organization of PU-FBN (50%) grafts in the regenerated arterial wall. However, 50% of FBN did not assure adequate mechanical resistance, and aneurysmal changes were seen in some grafts. DSC of CLG-based materials, processed by casting, showed that the synthetic component offered definite advantage compared to the CLG denaturation temperature, particularly noticeable for CLG-PAA and CLG-PVAL blends. Material advantages and drawbacks are discussed.\r"

Large-scale generation of ex vivo activated Mo from the blood of cancer patients proved feasible. We report our experience with a fixed rotor speed counterflow centrifugation elutration (CEE) procedure using the newly available Beckman high capacity JE-5.0 rotor system that reproducibly isolates up to 1.0-1.5 x 10(9) Mo with greater than 90% purity, in suspension and functionally intact derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-enriched suspensions obtained by leukapheresis (LP) from healthy volunteers and cancer patients. The semiclosed, easy to handle CCE system, was adapted to a sterile technique that permitted clinical trials in adoptive monocyte immunotherapy. Freshly isolated Mo did not lose morphological or functional integrity and had no spontaneous activation. Their abilities to become activated to the cytotoxic state after 18-h stimulation with 500 U/ml rIFN-gamma or 1 microgram/ml L-MTP-PE and to differentiate into matured M phi in vitro were not altered. The system was therefore used to isolate large numbers of Mo for a phase I clinical trial of intraperitoneal immunotherapy with L-MTP-PE activated autologous Mo in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Each patient received weekly Mo infusions (n = 5) with an intrapatient dose escalation schedule (from 10(7) to 10(9) Mo). Toxicities were mild including fever, chills and abdominal pain. There was no treatment-induced thromboembolic event or capillary leak syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because the pleural pressure gradient and regional distribution of pulmonary function are gravity dependent, substantial changes may be expected during weightlessness. Although very few measurements have been made during spaceflights, a number of observations during brief periods of weightlessness inside aircraft flying with parabolic trajectories confirm these predictions. Single-breath N2 washouts suggest a marked reduction in the inequality of ventilation distribution seen at 1 G. Similarly, inferences made from cardiogenic oscillations during single-breath washouts suggest a greater uniformity of perfusion during weightlessness. This is supported by changes seen on chest radiographs as well as by more direct measurements of regional blood flow distribution using radioactive iodine-labeled macroaggregates. Vital capacity is only slightly reduced, but functional residual capacity decreases by approximately 10% and maximum expiratory flow rates are slightly decreased, especially at low lung volumes. Weightlessness decreases abdominal girth, increases abdominal compliance, and substantially increases the abdominal contribution to tidal volume during resting breathing. Despite these changes, there does not appear to be any alteration in the temporal pattern of breathing. However, the deposition of inhaled medium-sized aerosol particles is substantially reduced, as predicted by model analyses of gravitational sedimentation. Virtually all these observations describe effects at the very onset of weightlessness. Practically nothing is known of slower functional changes and adaptations to prolonged weightlessness. Systematic repeated measurements during manned spaceflights will hopefully begin to provide some information on this subject in the near future.\r"

Twenty-seven healthy women were randomly assigned to either a control or exercise group. The program was satisfactorily completed and adequate biopsy material obtained from 6 controls and 13 exercisers. After initial testing of baseline maximal strength, exercisers began a training regimen consisting of seven exercises that stressed primary muscle groups of the lower extremities. No active intervention was prescribed for the controls. Increases in muscle strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. No significant strength changes were observed in the controls. Cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers significantly increased in the exercisers (20.1 +/- 6.8%, P = 0.02) compared with baseline. In contrast, no significant change in type II fiber area was observed in the controls. No significant changes in type I fiber area were found in either group. We conclude that a program of resistance exercise can be safely carried out by elderly women, such a program significantly increases muscle strength, and such gains are due, at least in part, to muscle hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Hormone and substrate responses to mild and heavy treadmill exercise were compared in women who used oral contraceptives (OC group; n = 7) and in normally menstruating women (control group; n = 8). Venous blood samples were obtained before exercise (-5 min), during exercise (15, 30, 45, and 60 min), and 30 min after exercise. All samples were analyzed for glucose, lactate, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), human growth hormone (hGH), cortisol, insulin, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P). Substrate patterns during exercise were not altered by the phase of the menstrual cycle or OC usage. However, in the OC group the FFA concentrations were consistently higher during mild exercise and the glucose concentrations were lower at rest and during exercise than in the control group (P less than 0.05). No differences in lactate or glycerol responses were observed between the groups (P greater than 0.05). The responses of insulin and hGH to exercise were not related to the OC use per se but rather to the steroid status, either endogenous or exogenous. Specifically, during the steroid phases (OC use phase and luteal phase) 1) insulin concentrations were not quite as markedly reduced (i.e., 12% higher when luteal phase and OC usage phase data were combined; P less than 0.05), and 2) hGH concentrations at rest and during light exercise were higher in the OC group during the OC use phase (P less than 0.05). LH patterns were not affected by exercise (P greater than 0.05), but a slight decrease was found in FSH (P less than 0.05). Increments in P and E2 were observed in the control group in both the follicular and luteal phase (P less than 0.05), but much greater increments in P occurred in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (P less than 0.05). In contrast to the control group, no increments in P, E2, or cortisol occurred in the OC users during exercise (P greater than 0.05). Therefore the new observations in this study are that 1) insulin and growth hormone respond in a complex manner during exercise with either the phase of the menstrual cycle or the phases of OC use and disuse and 2) the steroid concentrations (P, E2, cortisol) are increased in the controls but not in the OC users during exercise. The latter point suggests that normal steroid increments are due to an increased rate of secretion rather than a decrease in the hepatic clearance of these steroids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The flow rate of the following solutions was measured sequentially: normal saline, polycation protamine sulfate (0.08 mg/ml), cationic dextran (0.1 or 1.5%) or anionic dextran (0.1 or 1.5%), and hyaluronidase (testes, 0.02%) solution. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.35-7.40. The ratios of the flow of protamine sulfate and cationic dextran to that of saline averaged 2.3 +/- 0.92 (SD, n = 7) and 3.0 +/- 1.2 (n = 6), respectively. The anionic dextran-to-saline flow ratio averaged 0.72 +/- 0.28 (n = 13). Flow increased in the presence of positively charged molecules and decreased in the presence of negatively charged molecules. At a lower pH of 5.0-6.0, only 0.1% cationic dextran had an effect on interstitial conductivity. Thus pulmonary interstitium at physiological pH has the properties of a negatively charged membrane. The increased interstitial conductivity caused by the positively charged molecules was not observed after treatment with hyaluronidase. These effects of electric charge on interstitial conductivity were partly attributed to the presence in the interstitium of negatively charged hyaluronan.\r"

The contractile performance of perfused contracting rat diaphragms was manipulated with theophylline (10(-4) M), induced fatigue, or both. The increased contractility associated with theophylline was related to significant increases in 45Ca levels without changes in cAMP levels. Fatigue-diminished contractility was associated with increases in both 45Ca and cAMP levels. The increased 45Ca and cAMP levels associated with fatigue persisted, even in the presence of theophylline. Calcium channel blockade with 10(-4) M verapamil blocked the positive inotropic influence of theophylline as well as the theophylline-associated increase in 45Ca levels. Verapamil had no effect on either the fatigue-associated decreases in contractility or the fatigue-enhanced 45Ca uptake. The results of this study strongly suggest that the enhanced contractility associated with theophylline is related to its influence on cellular calcium metabolism. The elevated level of isotopic calcium measured in fatigued muscle probably represents calcium sequestered in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the result of cAMP-enhanced Ca-adenosine triphosphatase activity.\r"

The mean cross-sectional area of the fibers was 3,186 +/- 521 microns2, i.e., similar to those of Caucasian elite high-altitude climbers (3,108 +/- 303 microns2) and a group of climbers after a 6- to 8-wk sojourn at 5,000-8,600 m (3,360 +/- 580 microns2) but significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that of unacclimatized climbers (4,170 +/- 710 microns2) and slightly, although not significantly, lower than that of sedentary lowlanders (3,640 +/- 260 microns2). The number of capillaries per square millimeter of muscle cross section was 467 +/- 22, not significantly smaller than those of climbers on return from a Himalayan expedition (538 +/- 89) and elite high-altitude climbers (542 +/- 127) but significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than that of sedentary lowlanders (387 +/- 25). The volume density of mitochondria was 3.96 +/- 0.54%, significantly (P less than 0.05) less than the values found for any other investigated group, including sedentary subjects at sea level (4.74 +/- 0.30%).

  ".W": "Hydrogen sulfide is an irritant and chemical asphyxiant gas that exerts its primary toxic effects on the respiratory and neurological systems. Exposure to hydrogen sulfide above a threshold value of 200-300 ppm is characterized by the sudden onset of hemorrhagic pulmonary edema. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this response is associated with changes in the surface properties of pulmonary surfactant. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was retrieved from the lungs of Fischer 344 rats exposed to two concentrations of hydrogen sulfide or fresh air for 4 h. Surface tension-lowering properties were assayed using a captive bubble surface tensiometer. Lung injury was assessed by histopathology and measurements of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase activity in the lavagate. Marked abnormalities in surfactant activity were demonstrated in the lavagates from rats exposed to the highest concentration (300 ppm) of hydrogen sulfide. These involved the properties of adsorption to the air-water interface and surface tension lowering under quasi-static interfacial compression. Exposure to 200 ppm hydrogen sulfide had no effect on minimum surface tension despite a significant increase in protein and lactate dehydrogenase in the lavagate. This would suggest a threshold-type response for the inhibition of surfactant activity by hydrogen sulfide. In vitro studies using normal rat surfactant showed that the abnormalities in surfactant activity were due to inhibitors in the edema fluid and not to a direct effect of sulfide on surfactant. The pathophysiological consequences of increased alveolar surface tension after hydrogen sulfide exposure may need to be considered in the clinical setting.\r"

Capsaicin in doses from 10(-10) to 10(-7) mol induced a dose-dependent increase in airway opening pressure and release of SP-LI and NKA-LI. Airway opening pressure changes and the recovery of SP-LI and NKA-LI were significantly greater in lungs superfused with the NEP inhibitor SCH 32615 than in control lungs. ACE inhibition with captopril did not increase the mechanical response or the recovery of SP-LI compared with lungs not receiving captopril. In lungs from guinea pigs pretreated with high doses of capsaicin 7-10 days before study, a regimen designed to deplete endogenous tachykinins, there was a significant decrease in the content and release of NKA-LI and SP-LI. There were no detectable airway effects of acute capsaicin infusion even after doses of 10(-5) mol. Because NEP is important in modulating the airway effects of endogenously released tachykinins after tracheal infusion of capsaicin, but ACE is not, it seems likely that tracheal administration of capsaicin releases tachykinins from epithelial rather than endothelial loci.\r"

We studied the relationship between VO2 and DO2 of kidney and whole body during graded progressive exsanguination. The relationship between whole body VO2 and DO2 was biphasic, and whole body VO2 decreased by 5.6 +/- 14.4% (P = NS) from the initial value to the value nearest whole body DO2c. Kidney DO2 decreased in direct proportion to whole body DO2 such that the average R2 value describing the linear regression of kidney DO2 vs. whole body DO2 was 0.94 +/- 0.02. The relationship between kidney, like whole body, VO2 and DO2 appeared biphasic; however, kidney VO2 decreased by 63.3 +/- 10.4% (P less than 0.0001) from the initial value to the value nearest kidney DO2c. Renal O2 extraction ratio was relatively constant over a wide range of kidney DO2, whereas whole body O2 extraction ratio increased progressively at all whole body DO2 values as whole body DO2 decreased. However, final values of O2 extraction ratio were indistinguishable for whole body (0.86 +/- 0.1) and kidney (0.86 +/- 0.06) (P = NS).

  ".W": "Two metabolic features of altitude-adapted humans are the maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) paradox (higher work rates following acclimatization without increases in VO2max) and the lactate paradox (progressive reductions in muscle and blood lactate with exercise at increasing altitude). To assess underlying mechanisms, we studied six Andean Quechua Indians in La Raya, Peru (4,200 m) and at low altitude (less than 700 m) immediately upon arrival in Canada. The experimental strategy compared whole-body performance tests and single (calf) muscle work capacities in the Andeans with those in groups of sedentary, power-trained, and endurance-trained lowlanders. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor noninvasively changes in concentrations of phosphocreatine [( PCr]), [Pi], [ATP], [PCr]/[PCr] + creatine ([Cr]), [Pi]/[PCr] + [Cr], and pH in the gastrocnemius muscle of subjects exercising to fatigue. Our results indicate that the Andeans 1) are phenotypically unique with respect to measures of anaerobic and aerobic work capacity, 2) despite significantly lower anaerobic capacities, are capable of calf muscle work rates equal to those of highly trained power- and endurance-trained athletes, and 3) compared with endurance-trained athletes with significantly higher VO2max values and power-trained athletes with similar VO2max values, display, respectively, similar and reduced perturbation of all parameters related to the phosphorylation potential and to measurements of [Pi], [PCr], [ATP], and muscle pH derivable from nuclear magnetic resonance. Because the lactate paradox may be explained on the basis of tighter ATP demand-supplying coupling, we postulate that a similar mechanism may explain 1) the high calf muscle work capacities in the Andeans relative to measures of whole-body work capacity, 2) the VO2max paradox, and 3) anecdotal reports of exceptional work capacities in indigenous altitude natives.\r"

  ".W": "Although total respiratory compliance (Crs) has been shown to fall in adults on induction of halothane anesthesia, no successful paired studies have been reported in children. The multiple occlusion technique was used to measure Crs in 17 infants and young children during sedated sleep (CrsS) and shortly after, following induction of halothane anesthesia (CrsA). Crs fell in all but one infant after induction of anesthesia, with a mean fall of 34.7% (range 0-58%). This was accompanied by a reduction in tidal volume and increase in frequency in every case. In 7 of the 17 children, who were to be paralyzed for surgical purposes, Crs was also measured in this anesthetized-paralyzed state. When tidal volume administered during manual ventilation was similar to that observed during measurement of CrsA, Crs during this low-volume ventilation was similar to CrsA. When tidal volume was increased and Crs remeasured, there was a significant increase in every case, with the high-volume Crs within 10% of CrsS in all but one child, in whom there was a 31.4% increase with respect to CrsS. Changes in tidal volume accounted for approximately 50% of the variability in each state. These results demonstrate a highly significant fall in Crs in infants and young children after induction of halothane anesthesia. In addition it appears that this reduction in Crs can be reversed by paralyzing the child and manually ventilating with tidal volumes approximating those seen during sedation.\r"

During E, peak inspiratory mouth pressure was 65.7 +/- 1.8% (SD) of the maximum at functional residual capacity. However, during resistive runs, peak inspiratory mouth pressure was 41.1 +/- 2.8% of the maximum at functional residual capacity. In 36 paired runs, where both work rate and pressure-time product were within 10%, VO2resp for E was less than for R (81 and 96 ml/min, respectively; P less than 0.01). During loaded and unloaded breathing with the same tidal volume, we measured the changes in anteroposterior diameter of the lower rib cage in five subjects. In four subjects we also recorded the electromyograms of several fixator and stabilizing muscles. During E and R, the change in anteroposterior diameter of the lower rib cage was -116 +/- 5 and -45 +/- 4% (SE), respectively, of the unloaded value (P less than 0.01), indicating greater deformation during E. Although the peak electromyographic activity was 72 +/- 16% greater during E (P less than 0.01), there was no difference between the loads for area under the electromyogram time curve (P greater than 0.05). However, the time to 50% peak activity was less during R (P less than 0.02). We conclude that, even when work rate and pressure-time product are matched, VO2resp during R is greater than that during E. This difference may be due to preferential recruitment of faster and less efficient muscle fibers.\r"

Mean pulmonary P-Q coordinates were obtained during hypoxic ventilation and during ventilation with 100% O2 at normal and at increased left atrial pressure. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that, over a wide range, changes in left atrial pressure would alter the effects of hypoxic ventilation on pulmonary P-Q characteristics. Seven dogs were studied. When left atrial pressure was normal (5 mmHg), the mean value of the extrapolated intercept (PI) of the linear P-Q relationship was 10.9 mmHg and the slope (incremental vascular resistance, IR) of the P-Q relationship was 2.2 mmHg.l-1.min. Hypoxic ventilation increased PI to 18 mmHg (P less than 0.01) but did not affect IR. Subsequently, during ventilation with 100% O2, when left atrial pressure was increased to 14 mmHg by inflation of left atrial balloon, PI increased to 18 mmHg. IR was 1.6 mmHg.l-1.min. Again, hypoxic ventilation caused an isolated change in PI. Hypoxia increased PI from 18 to 28 mmHg (P less than 0.01). As in the condition of normal left atrial pressure, hypoxic ventilation did not affect IR. We conclude that, in an anesthetized intact canine preparation, hypoxic ventilation causes an isolated increase in the extrapolated pressure intercept of the pulmonary P-Q relationship. Furthermore the effects of hypoxic ventilation on pulmonary P-Q characteristics are not affected by the resting left atrial pressure.\r"

Thirteen male subjects resting in a supine position and wearing only shorts were exposed to 10 degrees C air (42% relative humidity and less than 0.4 m/s airflow) for 2 h. Measurements included surface electromyogram recordings at six muscle sites representing the trunk and limb regions of one side of the body, temperatures and heat fluxes at the same contralateral sites, and metabolic rate. The subjects were grouped according to lean (LEAN, n = 6) and average body fat (NORM, n = 7) content. While the rectal temperatures fluctuated slightly but not significantly during exposure, the skin temperature decreased greatly, more at the limb sites than at the trunk sites. Muscles of the trunk region began to shiver sooner and at a higher intensity than those of the limbs. The intensity of shivering and its increase over time of exposure were consistent with the increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient calculated from skin temperatures and heat fluxes. Both the onset of shivering and the magnitude of the increase in metabolic rate due to shivering were higher for the LEAN group than for the NORM group. A regression analysis indicates that, for a given decrease in mean skin temperature, the increase in metabolic rate due to shivering is attenuated by the square root of percent body fat. Thus the LEAN group shivered at higher intensity, resulting in higher increases in metabolic heat production and convective heat loss during cold air exposure than did the NORM group.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of xanthine oxidase in the microvascular dysfunction produced by activated granulocytes, we examined the effect of xanthine oxidase depletion or inhibition on the increase in microvascular permeability produced by infusion of the neutrophil activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Changes in vascular permeability were assessed by measurement of the solvent drag reflection coefficient for total plasma proteins (sigma) in rat hindquarters subjected to PMA infusion in xanthine oxidase-replete and -depleted animals, in animals pretreated with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol, and in animals depleted of circulating neutrophils by pretreatment with antineutrophil serum (ANS). Xanthine oxidase depletion was accomplished by administration of a tungsten-supplemented (0.7 g/kg diet) molybdenum-deficient diet. In animals fed the tungsten diet, muscle total xanthine dehydrogenase plus xanthine oxidase activity was decreased to less than 10% of control values. Estimates of sigma averaged 0.84 +/- 0.04 in control hindquarters, whereas PMA infusion was associated with a marked increase in microvascular permeability (decrease in sigma to 0.68 +/- 0.03). PMA infusion also caused an increase in the amount of the radical-producing oxidase form of xanthine oxidase (from 3.9 +/- 0.05 to 5.6 +/- 0.4 mU/g wet wt). ANS pretreatment attenuated this permeability increase (sigma = 0.77 +/- 0.04) and diminished the rise in xanthine oxidase activity (4.9 +/- 0.5 mU/g wet wt). Xanthine oxidase depletion with the tungsten diet or pretreatment with oxypurinol had no effect on this neutrophil-mediated microvascular injury (sigma = 0.69 +/- 0.06 and 0.67 +/- 0.03, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study of 27 healthy subjects examines the effects of restricted environmental stimulation technique (REST) on plasma levels of cortisol and variability in plasma cortisol levels across repeated REST sessions. The REST environment consisted of a 1.2 X 1.2 X 2.4-m ovoid chamber containing 25 cm of saturated MgSO4 solution (sp gr 1.28) maintained at 34.5 degrees F. The buoyant supinely floating subject experienced a minimum of light, sound, and temperature awareness and spatial orientation. The non-REST environment was a cushioned reclining chair in a quiet dimly lit room. The 5-wk protocol consisted of four visits for blood sampling during a 2-wk baseline followed by eight REST or non-REST sessions, 40 min each, with blood samples taken on four nonsession days between sessions 5 and 8. Variability in plasma cortisol was expressed in terms of standard deviation. REST was associated with across-session decreases of 21.6% in plasma cortisol and 50.5% in plasma cortisol variability, whereas no changes in these measures occurred in non-REST. It is concluded that REST influences both static and dynamic aspects of adrenocortical function, possibly altering the feedback monitoring of plasma cortisol.\r"

Activation of the expiratory muscles was invariably associated with a decrease in lung volume below the relaxed position of the respiratory system, a volume equal to 41.3 +/- 8.4 ml. This volume represented roughly 20% of tidal volume generated during spontaneous breathing. The fractional expiratory contribution to the tidal volume was unrelated to the size of the animal. Traction on the forelimbs (limb extension), however, tended to enhance the phasic expiratory activation of both the triangularis sterni and the transversus abdominis in the majority of animals. Moreover, after limb extension, the fractional contribution of tidal volume attributed to the phasic activation of the expiratory muscles increased in all but one animal. During spontaneous breathing with the forelimbs extended, roughly 25% of tidal volume was found to be due directly to phasic expiratory muscle contraction. The present observations firmly establish that in supine lightly anesthetized dogs breathing at rest the expiratory component of tidal volume represents a substantial contribution.\r"

The initial VO2max determined before training on the eight male subjects was 53.0 +/- 2.0 (SE) ml.kg-1.min-1. Analysis of samples obtained by needle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle before exercise (0 min) and at 15, 60, and 99 min of exercise indicated that on the average training resulted (P less than 0.05) in a 6.5% higher concentration of creatine phosphate, a 9.9% lower concentration of creatine, and a 39% lower concentration of lactate. Training had no effect on ATP concentration. These adaptations were also accompanied by a reduction in the utilization in glycogen such that by the end of exercise glycogen concentration was 47.1% higher in the trained muscle. Analysis of the maximal activities of representative enzymes of different metabolic pathways and segments indicated no change in potential in the citric acid cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase), beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase), glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase), or potential for glycogenolysis (phosphorylase) and glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase). With the exception of increases in the capillary-to-fiber area ratio in type IIa fibers, no change was found in any fiber type (types I, IIa, and IIb) for area, number of capillaries, capillary-to-fiber area ratio, or oxidative potential with training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Extracellular (ECW) and total body water (TBW) were determined by bromide and heavy water dilution techniques, respectively. Baseline impedance obtained from proximal electrodes was related to ECW (r = 0.95, P less than 0.001) and TBW (r = 0.80, P less than 0.02). After saline infusion, proximal electrodes detected a significant fall in impedance (P less than 0.001), whereas distal electrodes did not (P = 0.06). Furthermore, ECW and TBW could be estimated from the drop of proximal impedance after this bolus infusion (r = 0.82, P less than 0.02, and r = 0.86, P less than 0.01, respectively), but not from distal impedance measurements. Proximally placed impedance electrodes are superior to traditionally used distal electrodes for assessment of body fluid changes in the dog.\r"

Phrenic neural output during spontaneous breathing (SB) was compared with that occurring during constant-flow ventilation (CFV) at several levels of eucapnic hypoxemia. Hypoxia caused an increase in both the frequency and the amplitude of the moving time average (MTA) phrenic neurogram during both SB and CFV. The change in frequency as arterial saturation was reduced from 90 to 60% during SB was significantly higher than that during CFV [SB, 32.3 +/- 10.9 (SD) breaths/min; CFV, 10.3 +/- 5.8 breaths/min; P = 0.001]. By contrast, the increase in the amplitude of the MTA phrenic neurogram was smaller (SB, 0.62 +/- 0.68 units; CFV, 1.35 +/- 0.81 units; P = 0.01). The changes in frequency with hypoxia during both modes of ventilation resulted primarily from a shortening of expiratory time. Both inspiratory time and expiratory time were greater during CFV than during SB, but their change in response to hypoxia was not significantly different. We conclude that the amplitude response of the MTA phrenic neurogram to hypoxia is similar to that seen during hypercapnia; in the presence of phasic afferent feedback the MTA amplitude response is decreased and the frequency response is increased relative to the response observed in the absence of phasic afferents.\r"

Theophylline, another methylxanthine, has been shown to be effective during exercise but not at rest during cold stress. Therefore we hypothesized that caffeine ingestion before exercise in cold air would have a thermal-metabolic impact by increasing fat metabolism and increasing oxygen consumption. Young adult men (n = 6) who did not normally have caffeine in their diet performed four double-blind trials. Thirty minutes after ingesting placebo (dextrose, 5 mg/kg) or caffeine (5 mg/kg) they either exercised (60 W) or rested for 2 h in 5 degrees C air. Cold increased (P less than 0.05) plasma norepinephrine while both caffeine and exercise increased (P less than 0.05) epinephrine. Serum free fatty acids and glycerol were increased, but there were no differences between rest and exercise or placebo and caffeine. Caffeine had no influence on either respiratory exchange ratio or oxygen consumption either at rest or during exercise. The exercise trials did not significantly warm the body, and they resulted in higher plasma norepinephrine concentrations and lower mean skin temperatures for the first 30 min. The data suggest that skin temperature stimulates plasma norepinephrine while caffeine has little effect. In contrast, caffeine and exercise stimulate plasma epinephrine while cold has minimal effect. Within the limits of this study caffeine gave no thermal or metabolic advantage during a cold stress.\r"

Ten healthy subjects cycled to volitional exhaustion at 90% of their maximal capacity. Oxygen consumption, breathing pattern, and a visual analogue scale for respiratory effort were measured. Exercise was performed on three separate occasions, once immediately after induction of fatigue, whereas the other two episodes served as controls. Fatigue was achieved by having the subjects breathe against an inspiratory threshold load while generating 80% of their predetermined maximal mouth pressure until they could no longer reach the target pressure. After induction of fatigue, exercise time was reduced compared with control, 238 +/- 69 vs. 311 +/- 96 (SD) s (P less than 0.001). During the last minute of exercise, oxygen consumption and heart rate were lower after induction of fatigue than during control, 2,234 +/- 472 vs. 2,533 +/- 548 ml/min (P less than 0.002) and 167 +/- 15 vs. 177 +/- 12 beats/min (P less than 0.002). At exercise isotime, minutes ventilation and the visual analogue scale for respiratory effort were larger after induction of fatigue than during control. In addition, at exercise isotime, relative tachypnea was observed after induction of fatigue. We conclude that induction of inspiratory muscle fatigue can impair subsequent performance of high-intensity exercise and alter the pattern of breathing during such exercise.\r"

By using intracellular recording, miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) were first recorded in a normal [K]o Krebs solution. Subsequently, MEPPs were recorded in high [K]o Krebs solutions with four different Ca concentrations: Ca-free/ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mM Ca. In both the normal [K]o Krebs and the Ca-free-high [K]o Krebs solutions, MEPP frequency was lower at old than at young nerve terminals. In the three high [K]o Krebs solutions with Ca, MEPP frequency was progressively higher at old than at young nerve terminals with higher Ca concentrations. Periodic oscillations were observed in MEPP frequency of depolarized nerve terminals. The period of oscillation was inversely proportional to spontaneous transmitter release. These results demonstrate that when the nerve terminal is depolarized, permeability of the terminal membrane to Ca increases because of opening of voltage-dependent Ca channels. In the present study resting MEPP frequency was lower at old than at young terminals. On depolarization, MEPP frequency became higher at old than at young terminals. The study demonstrates that voltage-dependent Ca entry increases during aging at the soleus nerve terminal.\r"

The purpose of this study was to measure changes in hemodynamics, pulmonary mechanics, extravascular lung water, and lung morphometry after selectively injuring the bronchial vasculature in anesthetized sheep. In two groups of seven sheep, we injected oleic acid (0.1 ml/kg) or normal saline directly into the bronchoesophageal artery. We measured systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac output, oxygen saturation, pulmonary resistance and compliance, and lung volumes before and 1 and 4 h after injection. The lungs were removed for measurement of extravascular water, histology, and morphometry. Four hours after injection of oleic acid, cardiac output decreased but pulmonary arterial pressure did not change. In addition, pulmonary resistance increased and dynamic compliance and vital capacity decreased. Extravascular lung water was slightly but significantly greater in the oleic acid group. Histological examination showed interstitial edema and leukocytes in airway walls and sloughing of bronchial epithelium but little or no alveolar edema. Morphometric analysis showed significant thickening of airway walls. We conclude that direct injury to the bronchial vasculature increases lung resistance, decreases dynamic compliance, and increases extravascular lung water by the accumulation of an inflammatory infiltrate in airway walls.\r"

This study shows that laryngeal cooling affects the pattern of breathing in the guinea pig and assesses the potential role of cold receptors in this response by using a specific stimulant of cold receptors (l-menthol). The response to airflows (30 ml/s, 10-s duration) through the isolated upper airway was studied in 23 anesthetized (urethan, 1 g/kg ip) guinea pigs breathing through a tracheostomy. Respiratory airflow, tidal volume, laryngeal temperature, and esophageal pressure were recorded before the challenges (control), during cold airflows (25 degrees C, 55% relative humidity), and during warm airflows (37 degrees C, saturated) with or without the addition of l-menthol. Whereas warm air trials had no effect, cold air trials, which lowered laryngeal but not nasal temperature, reduced ventilation (VE) to 85% of control, mainly by prolonging expiratory time (TE, 145% of control), an effect abolished by laryngeal anesthesia. Addition of l-menthol to the warm airflow caused a greater reduction in VE (41% of control) by prolonging TE (1,028% of control). Nasal anesthesia markedly reduced the apneogenic effect of l-menthol but did not affect the response to cold air trials. In conclusion, both cooling of the larynx and l-menthol in the laryngeal lumen reduce ventilation. Exposure of the nasal cavity to l-menthol markedly enhances this ventilatory inhibition; considering the stimulatory effect of l-menthol on cold receptors, these results suggest a predominant role of nasal cold receptors in this response.\r"

  ".W": "Full methacholine dose-response curves were performed on anesthetized tracheostomized Fischer 344 adult rats treated neonatally with capsaicin (50 mg/kg) or with vehicle alone. Capsaicin, the hot extract of pepper, releases substance P (SP) from nonmyelinated sensory nerve endings and causes acute bronchoconstriction and airway microvascular leakiness. Chronic treatment with capsaicin leads to depletion of SP and other tachykinins from afferent C-fibers and can therefore be used as a tool to investigate the contribution of SP innervation to airway responses. The rats (9 controls and 6 treated with capsaicin) were paralyzed with succinylcholine and mechanically ventilated at a constant tidal volume and frequency. Airway resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were determined at each dose of methacholine from measurements of volume, flow, and transpulmonary pressure. Capsaicin-treated rats were found to have a significantly reduced baseline RL [0.150 +/- 0.039 (SD) vs. 0.225 +/- 0.050 cmH2O.ml-1.s, P = 0.009] and a correspondingly significantly elevated Cdyn (0.371 +/- 0.084 vs. 0.268 +/- 0.053 ml/cmH2O, P = 0.012). There was no significant difference in sensitivity to methacholine, but the maximal response to methacholine was significantly greater in the capsaicin-treated rats. In terms of RL, the maximal response for capsaicin-treated rats was 6.03 x baseline +/- 0.98 vs. 4.30 x baseline +/- 1.80 (P = 0.05) for controls, and for Cdyn changes the maximal decrease was 5.75 x baseline +/- 1.22 vs. 3.83 +/- 0.69 (P = 0.002). The observed differences in RL and Cdyn coupled with the differences in maximal responses can be attributed to the selective destruction of a subpopulation of pulmonary afferent C-fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increased NH3 production during submaximal exercise has been attributed to the activity of the purine nucleotide cycle, without consideration of any possible contribution from AA. Six men cycled at 75% of maximal O2 uptake until exhaustion on two occasions after 2.5 days of ingestion of a high-carbohydrate or mixed diet. Plasma samples (antecubital vein) and muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained at rest and during exercise and analyzed for plasma and muscle NH3 and AA as well as muscle metabolites. There were no significant diet effects in these parameters, so the majority of results focus on the effects of exercise. Plasma and muscle NH3 increased significantly from the onset and continued to increase throughout exercise. The total and total essential [AA] of muscle were significantly increased at exhaustion, whereas both the plasma and muscle branched-chain AA contents were unchanged. This suggests that protein catabolism was occurring during exercise and the branched-chain AA were used for energy and NH3 production.\r"

Steady-state prenodal lung lymph flows (Qw,l) and protein clearances were measured over a 2-h period at a constant capillary pressure (Pc, 13-33 cmH2O). Comparison between QA,t and QA,l as a function of Pc suggests that little of the albumin that crossed the capillary wall remained in the lung tissue, with most leaving in the lymph. Qw,l increased significantly as Pc increased, but lung tissue water was minimally affected. From the ratio of the clearance-Pc slopes for albumin and water, the albumin reflection coefficient was estimated to be 0.81 using QA,l and Qw,l and 0.56 using Qa,l and Qw,l. The permeability surface area product for the sum of blood-to-tissue and blood-to-lymph fluxes of labeled albumin (QA,t + QA,l) was 31 +/- 9 microliters/min, whereas that calculated from the blood-to-lymph flux of endogenous albumin (Qa,l) was 97 +/- 22 microliters/min. These data suggest that 1) both tissue and lymph accumulations of albumin must be considered when microvascular permeability is evaluated using protein tracers; 2) lymph clearance, but not tissue accumulation of albumin, was filtration dependent; and 3) lymph flow was an important contributor to the safety factor against edema formation over a moderate range of capillary pressures.\r"

Time to fatigue at 30% MVC was significantly less in sedentary subjects before training than in the other subject groups, but it was similar to the other groups posttraining. Stereological analyses of type I fibers indicated that Vvmit/Vvmyo was less in bodybuilders than in other subjects. Training at 30% MVC increased type I fiber Vvmit/Vvmyo of the soleus by 11% but did not affect the gastrocnemii. Training at 100% MVC did not alter Vvmit/Vvmyo in any muscle, nor was this ratio changed in type II fibers by either training program. Despite the morphological differences, both training protocols increased relative endurance, although greater fatigue resistance was seen after training at 30% MVC. Correlation analyses indicated that isometric endurance and improvements in muscle endurance by isometric exercise were not dependent on increasing interfibrillar Vvmit or Vvmit/Vvmyo in either fiber type.\r"

The time course of this failure of pulmonary blood flow regulation was investigated in six chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep after infusion of Escherichia coli LPS (1 microgram/kg). The change in left pulmonary arterial blood flow (LPBF, ultrasonic transit time) in response to unilateral lung hypoxia (10 min of N2 alternately to the left and right lungs) was compared before and at various time intervals after the administration of LPS. During baseline conditions, LPBF was 33% of total cardiac output and decreased to 15% when the left lung was ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture. One hour after endotoxin infusion, LPBF remained at 33% of total cardiac output yet only decreased to 28% during the hypoxic challenge. The response to one-lung hypoxia was still significantly depressed 10 h post-LPS administration. It is concluded that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is almost completely abolished for a prolonged time period after a small dose of LPS.\r"

Occlusion data were obtained from isolated dog lung lobes under normal control conditions, during hypoxia, and during histamine or serotonin infusion. The data used in the analysis include the slope of the arterial pressure curve and the zero time intercept of the extrapolated venous pressure curve after venous occlusion, the equilibrium pressure after simultaneous occlusion of both the arterial inflow and venous outflow, and the area bounded by equilibrium pressure and the arterial pressure curve after arterial occlusion. We analyzed these data by use of a compartmental model in which the vascular bed is represented by three parallel compliances separated by two series resistances, and each of the three compliances and the two resistances can be identified. To interpret the model parameters, we view the large arteries and veins as mainly compliance vessels and the small arteries and veins as mainly resistance vessels. The capillary bed is viewed as having a high compliance, and any capillary resistance is included in the two series resistances. With this view in mind, the results are consistent with the major response to serotonin infusion being constriction of large and small arteries (a decrease in arterial compliance and an increase in arterial resistance), the major response to histamine infusion being constriction of small and large veins (an increase in venous resistance and a decrease in venous compliance), and the major response to hypoxia being constriction of the small arteries (an increase in arterial resistance). The results suggest that this approach may have utility for evaluation of the sites of action of pulmonary vasomotor stimuli.\r"

Removal of RE had no effect on the values of the resting membrane potential of ASM cells. In the presence of RE in the preparation, both electrical and contractile responses to PMA (10(-5) M) were significantly different compared with the response of ASM to PMA without RE. When the RE was present, stimulation of protein kinase C caused only a biphasic response in both membrane potential and isometric force. In either the presence or absence of RE, amiloride (10(-5) M) and a low-sodium solution inhibited both electrical and contractile changes of ASM cells caused by PMA. In the presence or absence of RE, verapamil (10(-5) M) attenuated (P less than 0.05) both electrical and contractile responses of ASM cells as induced by PMA. Verapamil, however, had no effect on the last phase of PMA-induced response. Pretreatment of preparations with indomethacin (10(-6) M) changed the PMA-induced response of ASM with RE to a response usually observed in ASM without RE. Finally, the incubation of tracheal preparations without RE with prostaglandin E2 (10(-8) M) altered the response of these preparations in such a way that their electrical and contractile response to PMA was essentially identical to the PMA response observed in preparations with an intact RE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inflated lungs are characterized by a short nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decay (rapid disappearance of NMR signal), likely due to internal (tissue-induced) magnetic field inhomogeneity produced by the alveolar air-tissue interface. This phenomenon can also be detected using temporally symmetric and asymmetric NMR spin-echo sequences; these sequences generate a pair of NMR images from which a difference signal (delta) is obtained (reflecting the signal from lung water experiencing the air-tissue interface effect). We measured delta in normal excised rat lungs at inflation pressures of 0-30 cmH2O for asymmetry times (a) of 1-6 ms. Delta was low in degassed lungs and increased markedly with alveolar opening when measured at a = 6 ms (delta 6 ms); delta 6 ms varied little during the rest of the inflation-deflation cycle. Delta 1 ms (a = 1 ms) did not vary significantly on inflation and deflation. Measurements of delta at a = 3 and 5 ms generally lay between those of delta 1 ms and delta 6 ms. These findings, which are consistent with theoretical predictions, suggest that measurements of delta at appropriate asymmetry times are particularly sensitive to alveolar opening and may provide a means of distinguishing alveolar recruitment from alveolar distension in the pressure-volume behavior of the lung.\r"

To investigate the importance of these factors on the cardiovascular response, we administered five doses [0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)] of enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane to each of six dogs. Twelve hemodynamic variables were measured. For all variables, a change in the dose of each drug produced a consistent effect in each dog. Increases in dose resulted in significant decreases in seven variables [left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI), and heart rate (HR)] and a significant increase in one variable [central venous pressure (CVP)]. In contrast, the response of individual dogs to different drugs was not consistent. For seven variables [MAP, MPAP, LVSWI, CVP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), and end-systolic volume index (ESVI)], a significant difference in the responses of a dog to two drugs was greater than zero, whereas a significant difference in the response of at least one other dog to the same two drugs was less than zero (discordant dog-drug interactions). Thus, in contrast to the consistency of the cardiovascular response to changes in dose, the hemodynamic response to different drugs was inconsistent among dogs. We also studied the effect of fluid challenge on hemodynamic response at 1.5 or 2.0 MAC of the three drugs given to each dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For both MRI and CT, AT volumes (cm3) per transverse slice (3-mm thickness, 21-mm centers) were determined using a computer-based image analysis system that permitted detailed comparisons of both visceral and subcutaneous AT depots. Total AT volumes were calculated using a linear interpolation of AT areas obtained on consecutive slices. Correlation coefficients between MRI and CT for visceral [r = 0.98, standard error of estimate (SEE) = 6.8 cm3], subcutaneous (r = 0.98, SEE = 6.5 cm3), and total AT volumes (r = 0.99, SEE = 9.0 cm3) were highly significant (P less than 0.001).

Post hoc Scheffe contrasts demonstrated that the mean AT and lipid mass values derived by the three methods were not significantly different (P = 0.01).

For this purpose, a Cushing response was elicited repeatedly during incomplete global CI in anesthetized artificially ventilated cats after vagotomy and baroreceptor denervation. In control animals without CI, sympathetic activity in response to brief elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) showed a well-repeatable two-phase reaction. During CI there was a progressive deterioration of background sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) over a period of 30 min. SND response to repeated elevation of ICP was initially similar to control response but later with progression of CI was seriously changed. 1) Instead of the usual hyperactivation, sympathetic nerve activity was depressed during intracranial hypertension. 2) The characteristic desynchronized activity either appeared later during the reperfusion period or remained absent. The progressive loss of SND response to raised ICP in developed CI was compared with the changes seen in experiments in which repeated ICP elevations were superimposed on asphyxia. These findings suggest that the sympathetic component of the Cushing reaction strongly depends on the actual state of brain stem autonomic circuits and may be seriously altered in pathological situations involving ischemic brain injury.\r"

Quantitative serial section analyses of vascular perfusion-fixed rat lungs were used to determine the anatomic dead space proximal to specific ventilatory units as well as the gas volume of these ventilatory units. Three reconstructions, each consisting of ventilatory units distal to a specific bronchus, were carried out. The number of ventilatory units for each reconstruction varied from 26 to 71. The average ventilatory unit volume for the three reconstructions [0.53 +/- .03 (SE) mm3] was not significantly different from measurements based on random sampling. The distribution of ventilatory unit volume was diverse, with 15% of the population having a volume less than 0.3 mm3 and 9% of the population having a volume greater than 1.0 mm3. For a gas of relatively low reactivity (e.g., oxygen) the predicted oxygen uptake per unit surface area did not vary significantly between ventilatory units. The predicted oxygen uptake was approximately 92% of the uptake in the absence of gradients in oxygen concentration between ventilatory units. For a highly reactive gas (e.g., ozone), the predicted uptake per unit surface area in the proximal portions of larger ventilatory units was significantly greater than the average uptake. These results suggest that focal areas of injury likely result from exposure to inhaled reactive gases.\r"

  ".W": "We compared regional measurements of the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (rPTCER) for 68Ga-transferrin, obtained by positron emission tomography (PET), with morphometric data obtained from corresponding tissue samples in six anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs, 1 h after oleic acid administration to either the left caudal lobe (0.015 ml/kg; Lobar group, n = 3) or the right atrium (0.08 ml/kg; Diffuse group, n = 3). Data were obtained from 48 regions in both injured and control lobes (right caudal lobes from the Lobar group). The volume density of edematous or hemorrhagic alveoli at the light-microscopic level was directly related to rPTCER (r = 0.82 for regions with rPTCER values less than 700 x 10(-4) min-1). Likewise, the relative surface of abnormal capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium at the electron-microscopic level correlated well with rPTCER (r = 0.87 for regions with rPTCER less than 1,200 X 10(-4) min-1). We conclude that the rPTCER measurements obtained with PET reflect the morphological heterogeneity present in oleic acid-damaged lung tissue. Thus rPTCER measurements should be useful as a noninvasive quantitative index of lung injury. Furthermore, the tomographic image display of rPTCER may allow PET to be used as a \"physiological probe\" to guide tissue excision for later histological evaluation when lung injury is heterogeneous.\r"

To examine the respiratory-related electrical activity of the CT, we measured its electromyogram (EMG) and compared it with that of the alae nasi (AN) in eight healthy subjects. During quiet breathing the CT EMG phasing was inspiratory in seven subjects. This pattern was similar to the AN with respect to phasing and shape of the integrated EMG. The onset of phasic CT and AN activity related to inspiration preceded flow by 173 +/- 39 and 570 +/- 76 (SE) ms, respectively (P less than 0.01). We measured the duration from onset of phasic activity to peak of the EMG (TA) and the total cycle duration (TT). TA/TT of the CT was 0.29 +/- 0.02, similar to that of the AN (0.28 +/- 0.03). Inspiratory resistive loading, panting, and voluntary hyperventilation increased CT activity above the peak level seen during tidal breathing. Voluntary glottic closure increased CT activity to a level above tonic but below peak tidal activity. The findings suggest that the phasic electrical activity of the CT simulates predominantly that of an upper airway dilator.\r"

During both progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia and hypoxia, peak integrated inspiratory activity (moving time average, MTA) of the CT and AN increased as a power function of mean inspiratory flow (ratio of tidal volume to inspiratory time, VT/TI), given by MTA = a(VT/TI)b + c (where a, b, and c are constants). The exponent b varied from 0.009 to 3.4 among subjects but was correlated between CT and AN both during hypercapnia (r = 0.86) and hypoxia (r = 0.81). The onset of inspiratory activity of the CT and AN preceded that of inspiratory flow. Expressed as a percentage of expiratory time, the CT lead time rose from 7% at rest to 20% during hyperpnea. The corresponding values for the AN were from 22 to 52% (both P less than 0.03). Thus the pattern of response of the CT and AN is similar and related to that of the inspiratory muscles in a curvilinear manner. The findings suggest that during chemical stimulation the electrical activity of the CT is analogous to that of the AN, an upper airway dilator.\r"

The pressure was generated 1) \"actively\" by subjects inspiring against an externally occluded airway or 2) \"passively\" by external suction at the mouth during voluntary glottic closure with no inspiratory effort. Airway dimensions were imaged with X-ray fluoroscopy and anteroposterior diameters measured at levels corresponding to cervical vertebra 3 and 4 (C3 and C4). Cephalad axial displacement of the hyoid bone (CDHY) was also measured. During the \"active\" maneuver, airway diameters and position were maintained at resting levels despite airway pressure up to -15 cmH2O. In contrast, during the passive maneuver at -15 cmH2O, C3 was only 15 +/- 9% and C4 only 47 +/- 8% of control; CDHY was 5.6 +/- 1.8 mm. In three subjects airway wall apposition occurred and persisted until an active inspiratory effort. We conclude that, in the absence of inspiratory effort, negative oropharyngeal airway pressures result in marked narrowing and cephalad displacement of the upper airway, even during wakefulness. Therefore, our data suggest that the complex interaction of upper airway and thoracic muscle activity is critical in determining the effective compliance and patency of the upper airway, which is readily collapsible even in normal subjects.\r"

The PCA activity was recorded using bipolar fine-wire electrodes, expressed as a percentage of the quiet breathing level and altered by mechanical ventilation, changes in lung volume, and chest wall compression. Subglottic pressure was recorded while a constant flow of air was passed through the upper airway. In the absence of PCA activity the PV relationship was alinear and could be described by a power function (P = K0Va, where K0 and a are constants). The slope of the log P-log V plots in the absence of PCA and thyroarytenoid activity was 1.83 +/- 0.02 (SD), whereas with increasing PCA activity it was 1.88 +/- 0.11. An effective hydraulic diameter (DH) was calculated for 20% increments of PCA activity, and in two dogs glottic diameter (Dg) was calculated from glottic area measurements obtained by fiber-optic laryngoscopy. Both DH and Dg increased linearly with increasing PCA activity. Denervation of the cricothyroid muscle had no systematic effect on laryngeal resistance. The results indicate that the PV relationship of the larynx may be described by a power function with a single exponent, the magnitude of which is independent of glottic dilator muscle activity and consistent with orifice flow. However, laryngeal diameter increases linearly with PCA activity in the range studied.\r"

Exercise evoked stimulus-dependent and marked elevations of RVR, arterial NE, epinephrine (Epi), and DA. RVR increased by 140% and the renal overflows of NE and DA increased by 1,331 and 179%, respectively, at 188 W. A net removal of NPY-LI at rest turned into a small net renal overflow, which correlated with increases in RVR at 188 W. Increases in renin release (+1,200% at 188 W) correlated with increases in renal NE and DA overflows and with arterial Epi levels. Arterial ANG II levels increased stimulus dependently (by 264% at 188 W) and correlated more closely with increases in RVR than did other variables. Thus dynamic exercise is a potent stimulus for renal nerve activation in humans, and renal sympathetic nerve activity may contribute to increased RVR both directly (NE and, at exhaustive work loads, possibly NPY) and indirectly (via renin-mediated ANG II formation).\r"

Also described is its validation and use in assessing the changes in chest wall shape after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in 12 patients. The positions of a small number of anatomic locations on the thoracic spine, ribs, manubrium, and sternum are measured from lateral and posterior-anterior chest radiographs. The computer program puts these two views together removing the magnification and reconstructs any missing points to give a three-dimensional picture of the rib cage to which mathematical models of the bones are scaled. The patients had chest radiographs taken at total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) to investigate the source of the restrictive ventilatory defect that follows CABG. The predictions from the model were tested by comparing full-sized computer plots with the actual chest radiographs. The estimates of the bony structures were accurate to +/- 3 degrees for orientations and +/- 6 mm for positions. We found reduced rib motion both \"pump-handle\" (theta) and \"bucket handle\" (psi) going from theta, psi left, psi right = 9 degrees, 10 degrees, 14 degrees to 4 degrees, 10 degrees, 9 degrees, respectively, after surgery with P less than 0.025, 0.42, 0.07. The angles were measured from the horizontal and increased caudally. There was also reduction in the range of angles subtended by the arc of the thoracic vertebrae between TLC and RV, which went from 12 degrees to -1 degrees (P less than 0.015). These data explain the fall in lung volumes that follow CABG and provide insight into the contribution made by the ribs and spine in full inspiration and full expiration.\r"

The rats underwent one of three levels of dietary treatment: ad libitum (AL), moderate restriction (MR), and severe restriction (SR). Compared with AL-CC (cage confined; 647 +/- 13 g), the AL-E (84% of AL-CC), MR-CC (77%), MR-E (77%), SR-CC (63%), and SR-E (63%) groups were all reduced in body mass. At the MR level, E significantly reduced fat mass (FM; MR-CC 73 +/- 5, MR-E 45 +/- 5 g) and increased water mass (WM; MR-CC 307 +/- 5, MR-E 329 +/- 5 g) compared with CC. In contrast, no significant differences existed between the SR-CC and SR-E groups. Exercise training did not result in conservation of protein mass at any level of dietary intake. Exercise training significantly elevated RMR (on a kg0.75 basis) by approximately 7% for the AL-E and MR-E groups compared with their respective dietary counterparts. These findings may help reconcile the conflicting results present in the literature with respect to the effects of exercise training during diet-induced weight loss. That is, studies using relatively severe dietary restrictions are less likely to demonstrate exercise-induced changes in RMR, FM, and WM than those employing moderate dietary restrictions.\r"

The Tri-mag processing unit outputs the position of each sensor relative to the transmitter in three orthogonal coordinates, and this information is communicated to the PC. First, we demonstrated that within a defined octant of a sphere in which the center is the transmitter, we can measure radial distances with an accuracy of +/- 1 mm over a range extending from 10 to 70 cm from the transmitter. Second, we recorded the three-dimensional movement of sensors on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the chest wall during maximum voluntary ventilation in four normal men; all sensors were placed in the midsagittal plane of the body. Anterior sensors were located on the sternum at the level of the third intercostal space and at 2 cm above the umbilicus, whereas posterior sensors were located on the posterior spine at the same vertical levels as the anterior sensors. In all subjects the following was found. 1) Both anterior sensors moved anterior and cephalad during inspiration. The anterior thoracic sensor showed greater vertical than anteroposterior (A-P) movement, whereas the anterior abdominal sensor showed greater A-P than vertical movement. 2) Inspiration was associated with spinal extension, whereas expiration was associated with spinal flexion. Third, we used Tri-mag information to 1) measure tidal volume (VT) over a range extending from 500 ml to inspiratory capacity and 2) measure the change in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) over a range extending from FRC to FRC plus a minimum of 1.5 liters. Our results indicate that greater than 96% of the changes in VT and greater than 82% of the changes in EELV can be accounted for by changes in A-P, vertical, and lateral dimensions of the chest wall.\r"

One day after sciatic nerve sectioning, when decreases in the stimulation of soleus 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake by insulin (-51%, P less than 0.001), contractions (-29%, P less than 0.05), or insulin and contractions in combination (-40%, P less than 0.001) were observed, there was a slight (-18%, NS) decrease in GLUT-4 protein. By day 3 of denervation, stimulation of 2-DG uptake by insulin (-74%, P less than 0.001), contractions (-31%, P less than 0.001), or the two stimuli in combination (-59%, P less than 0.001), as well as GLUT-4 protein (-52%, P less than 0.001), was further reduced. Soleus muscle from hindlimb-suspended rats, which develops an enhanced capacity for insulin-stimulated glucose transport, showed muscle atrophy similar to denervated soleus but, in contrast, displayed substantial increases in GLUT-4 protein after 3 (+35%, P less than 0.05) and 7 days (+107%, P less than 0.001). These results indicate that altered GLUT-4 expression may be a major contributor to the changes in insulin-stimulated glucose transport that are observed with denervation and unweighting. We conclude that muscle activity is an important factor in the regulation of GLUT-4 expression in skeletal muscle.\r"

Compensatory hypertrophy, which induces slow myosin expression, was produced by surgical removal of a synergistic hindlimb muscle. Hyperthyroidism increased the percentage of type II fibers and the fast myosin isoforms in both the plantaris and soleus muscles. Hypertrophy significantly increased the percentage of type I fibers and the slow myosin type in the plantaris and soleus muscles. However, with the simultaneous introduction of hyperthyroidism and hypertrophy, only the hyperthyroid effects were observed. Hyperthyroidism and not physiological demand was found to be the dominant regulator of skeletal muscle myosin expression.\r"

Many of these questions can be attacked by imaginative use of the tools already in hand. The need is urgent.

Detailed neurologic, medical, and angiographic information was obtained for all patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: (1) stenosis of VA with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; (2) very tight stenosis (greater than 75%) of the dominant VA with stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral VA; (3) very tight stenosis of VA with bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA); (4) very tight stenosis of VA with homolateral ICA lesion eligible for simultaneous repair; (5) very tight stenosis of VA and very tight stenosis of the homo or contralateral carotid siphon. There were 15 isolated vertebral lesions (group I), and 22 were VA lesions associated with lesions of the supraaortic trunks which were simultaneously treated (group II). The reconstructions of the first portion of the VA were 30 (12 of group I and 18 of group II) and reimplantation of the VA into the common carotid artery was the procedure of choice. There were 7 revascularizations of the third portion of the VA at C1-C2 level (3 of group I and 4 of group II): carotid-vertebral bypass, using an autogenous vein graft, was the procedure of choice. Three patients in group II died in the immediate postoperative period from myocardial infarction but no patient presented immediate postoperative neurologic deficits. All symptomatic patients but one were relieved of their symptoms in a median follow-up of 31 months. No postoperative complications were observed. Long-term results were satisfactory in all the 28 patients at their last follow-up visit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the exception of one patient who died of stroke, none of the patients developed a permanent neurologic deficit. The cumulative death rate was 6.5%; myocardial infarction was the most common cause (3 out of 7). Anatomic progression of plaques was determined by duplex scanning in 22% of the internal carotid arteries. No relationship between progression of these plaques and the development of new TIAs was evident. We conclude that, in this group of patients, TIAs do not inevitably lead to stroke and that TIAs are not predictable based on risk factors or plaques characteristics.\r"

  ".U": "91324347\r", 
  ".W": "Although carotid endarterectomy is the standard procedure, the purpose of this paper is to describe a new surgical technique and indicate its role in the surgery of cervical cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of resection of the pathologic carotid artery bifurcation followed by its total replacement with a bifurcated thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft constructed by the surgeon. Prosthetic graft reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation (PGRCB) was performed in 21 patients (25 procedures) from November 1984 to May 1987. Many patients were over 70 years old. The indications for surgery were transient ischemic attacks (TIA)'s in 10 patients (high-grade stenosis), established stroke with mild deficit in 3 patients (high-grade stenosis). Eight patients (high-grade stenosis) were asymptomatic and 4 had vertebro-basilar symptoms. In 11 procedures the indications were the same as for standard carotid endarterectomy (significant stenosis and/or ulcerated plaque). In 14 cases, the procedure was justified by extensive lesions involving a long segment of the internal carotid artery (2 restenoses, 12 calcified lesions). In the perioperative period, there were no deaths and no TIA's. The 25 procedures were assessed one month postoperatively by ultrasonic imaging and venous substraction angiography. All the grafts were patent with perfect restoration of the carotid bifurcation anatomy. Systematic follow-up study was carried out in 1987. Three patients had died of non-neurologic causes and one was lost to study. The remaining 19 procedures were evaluated with an average follow-up of 19 months (range 7 to 32 months). The patients were asymptomatic and all the grafts remained patent including one stenosis (greater than 50%) at the common carotid artery anastomosis. Because recent studies have documented a much higher rate of technical defects or recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we believe that PGRCB merits consideration, particularly in difficult endarterectomies, and in recurrent carotid stenosis. Furthermore it seems acceptable to advocate PGRCB in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery and in post-irradiation arteritis.\r"

Duplex scanning and computerised tomography were valuable adjuncts in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was confirmed by aortography in 52 patients. Of 49 patients operated upon electively three died with a mortality rate of 6.1%; of the 4 patients operated upon as emergencies 2 died. Fifty patients survived the operative procedure and of the 3 operated upon under normothermia 1 developed paraplegia, whereas of the 47 patients operated upon under moderate hypothermia (30 degrees-31 degrees C) only 1 developed paraplegia.\r"

  ".W": "We performed descending thoracic aorta to femoral bypass in six selected patients over the past four years. An alternative inflow source was selected because the standard transabdominal approach was contraindicated or considered hazardous. The inflow consisted of a single Dacron tube from the descending thoracic aorta to the left groin, and a femorofemoral bypass to the right groin. There was no operative mortality or major morbidity related to the surgical procedure. After an average follow-up of 17.1 months (range 6 to 23 months), all thoracofemoral grafts remained patent. One patient had repeated occlusions of the femorofemoral graft related to right lower extremity outflow disease, while the remaining five crossover grafts are patent. One patient died 22 months postoperatively from a myocardial infarct, with a patent bypass. Although this series represents a small group of patients, we feel that descending thoracic aortofemoral bypass offers excellent inflow and reliable patency, and is a good alternative when reoperation on the abdominal aorta is undesirable. This procedure may also be considered for conversion of an axillofemoral bypass that has failed repeatedly.\r"

Four asymptomatic, early cases of HUN were observed in the 57 ureters examined (7%); all four complications regressed in less than 30 days. No cases of symptomatic early or late HUN were observed in this series. Asymptomatic early HUN was a frequent complication in our series (7%) but its benign course does not justify systematic screening. These asymptomatic complications contrast with the symptomatic cases of early or late HUN reported in the literature which necessitated urologic and vascular investigations.\r"

We report 84 cases of the simultaneous association of direct arterial surgery and angioradiological procedures to treat 82 patients with arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs. Sixty-five patients (79.2%) were affected by severe claudication and 14 (19.6%) presented with rest pain or gangrene. One patient (1.2%) had signs of acute ischemia. PTA or LPTA were utilized as an inflow procedure in 41 cases (48.8%), as an outflow procedure in 24 (28.6%) and in 19 cases (22.6%) to recanalize an arterial occlusion in the contralateral limb opposite to surgical interventions. Immediate postoperative patency was achieved in 79 cases (94.0%), while in 5 cases (6.0%) it was impossible to perform a satisfactory balloon dilatation. The complication rate was 16.6%: 10 perioperative thromboses, 1 plaque dissection, 1 peripheral embolus, 1 haemorrhage and 1 femoral nerve lesion. No perioperative mortality occurred in this group of patients. Long term patency, analyzed with the life-table method (mean follow-up: 28 months) was respectively 78.0%, 76.3% and 78.9% at 5 years. These data indicate that the combined revascularization technique should always be recommended in properly selected patients because it is less invasive, the surgical risk and operative time are reduced and associated with early and long term cumulative patency rates comparable to those of extensive surgery.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the rehabilitation potential of patients undergoing amputation for vascular disease. A total of 101 patients were studied with a mean age of 69 +/- 14 years, 26 of whom were over age 80. Operative indications were gangrene or ulceration in 80% with rest pain in 20%. Eighteen patients were bilateral amputees. Fifty per cent of the patient population had previous vascular operations. The operative mortality was 13% and was not affected by the age of the patients or the presence of diabetes. Most operative deaths were due to cardiac or septic respiratory complications. Twenty-four of 88 surviving patients were not considered candidates for rehabilitation and the major determining factor was the occurrence of a remote or perioperative stroke. None of these 24 patients was discharged from institutional care. Sixty-four patients were considered rehabilitation candidates with equal distribution in all age groups. Ninety-five per cent of these patients were discharged home with 80% of those patients over 80 being discharged. Eighty-seven per cent of the elderly rehabilitation candidates were fitted with prostheses which compares favourably to other age groups. Seventy-three per cent of the elderly reached their rehabilitation goals (most frequently ambulation with the aid of a walker) which is only slightly less than the younger amputation group. From this study we conclude that amputations which are done for ease of nursing care and patient comfort in debilitated patients have a high mortality rate and rehabilitation goals are unlikely to be met. We have demonstrated high success rates with rehabilitation including patients over age 80. The majority of these patients may be discharged home after a period of aggressive rehabilitation.\r"

Five dogs had a preliminary procedure consisting of the creation of a latissimus dorsi flap and a thoracotomy in which the flap was wrapped around the descending aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. An epicardial lead was placed on the left ventricle and a nerve stimulating lead placed around the thoraco-dorsal nerve. Three weeks later, both leads were connected to a cardiomyostimulator programmed to function in a counterpulsation mode with a 1:2 assist frequency. Hemodynamic measurements were made at 6 and 8 and 10 and 12 weeks and the dogs were sacrificed. Three dogs had all sets of hemodynamic measurements made. Two of the three dogs demonstrated diastolic augmentation at 6 and 8 and 10 and 12 weeks average 20 to 25 mmHg. The third dog failed to demonstrate any change. All dogs were sacrificed at 12 weeks and specimens were submitted for histologic evaluation. The muscle flap was preserved in all animals. The aorta subjacent to the flap showed, (1) normal intima with no evidence of disruption or thrombus in all animals, (2) in the animals in whom counterpulsation was observed, there appeared to be thinning of the media in the aorta subjacent to the muscle flap, and (3) no evidence of distal emboli. This study demonstrated that chronic counterpulsation can be obtained with a latissimus dorsi flap. The actual hemodynamic benefits are not determined from this study. The medial thinning in the aortic wall may limit the long-term benefit of this procedure.\r"

Fifty-four patients with main left coronary obstruction (greater than 50%) were divided in three groups: Group I (20), TP less than 5 minutes; Group II (15), TP = 5-15 minutes; and Group III (19), TP greater than 15 minutes. Monitoring parameters included: systemic perfusion pressure during TP, perfusion flows, length of TP, time of ischemia, myocardial temperatures during ischemia, postoperative CK-MB level, EKG-detectable infarction, and postoperative therapeutic support requirements. Results: Intraoperative myocardial infarction by EKG was 0% in Group I, 7% in Group II, and 26.3% in Group III; mortality was 0%, 0%, and 15.7%, respectively. CK-MB values were 18 +/- 3.2 IU, Group I; 18.3 +/- 2.5 IU, Group II; and 49.4 +/- 10.3 IU, Group III. Group I vs. III: P 0.01. Levels of postoperative support: Level A, less than 12 hours; Level B, 12-36 hours; and Level C, greater than 36 hours. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was considered Level C.

Between 1974 and 1988, 1175 prosthetic valves were implanted in 1026 patients by one cardiac surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. Of these 539 (52.5%) were aortic (AVR), 334 (32.6%) mitral (MVR), 7 (0.7%) tricuspid, and 144 (14%) AV and MV double valve replacements (DVR). There were only 2 triple valve replacements. The prosthetic valves implanted were the Starr-Edwards (7%), Bjork Shiley (11.8%), Lillehei-Kaster (23%), Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthesis (35.2%), Duromedics bileaflet (16.4%) and a variety of other mechanical and bioprosthetic valves (6.6%). Over the 15 year period there were a total of 82 (7%) valve failures of which PPL was diagnosed in 29 (2.5%) valves in 24 patients. Presenting features included cardiac decompensation in 72%, bacterial endocarditis in 12% and haemolytic anaemia in 12%. One patient (4%) had no symptoms. Nineteen patients underwent re-operation. Median time to re-operation was 15 months (range 1-65 months) with a re-operative mortality of 22%. Clinical evidence of prosthetic valve infection was found in 79% of MVR and 67% of AVR. A heavily calcified aortic annulus, found in 47% of patients, may also have contributed to PPL after AVR.\r"

One hundred and forty randomly selected patients with isolated mitral insufficiency were studied, half of whom had MVR with preservation of the posterior leaflet (Group I), whereas in the other half conventional MVR was performed, without preservation of the posterior leaflet (Group II). Within these two groups there were no in hospital deaths, but 5 patients in Group II were admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure and 3 of them died after approximately 6 months. Long term mortality rate was 4.2% in Group II. Ejection fraction (EF) decreased postoperatively from 56% to 50% in Group I (p less than 0.05), and from 59% to 49% in Group II (p less than 0.05). Fifteen patients in each group and aged below 30 with sinus rhythm and in the first functional capacity according to the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) were subjected to exercise study, 18 months after the operation. After exercise EF increased from 47% to 64% in Group I and decreased from 51% to 47% in Group II. These findings suggested that MVR with the preservation of the chordae tendineae can be done with a low morbidity and mortality rate in the early and late postoperative period.\r"

It was found that CK-MB, LDH, LDH1 and myoglobin showed significant elevations which mimicked a perioperative myocardial infarction. SGOT also increased, but remained within the normal range. CK-MB, LDH and LDH1 increased more in the coronary bypass grafted patients whereas myoglobin increased in the patients who had atriotomies. It was concluded that in order to demonstrate a perioperative myocardial infarction it is necessary to determine at least two of these enzymes for a long period and to correlate these results with the clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the occurrence and outcome of patients with this complication. At our institution between 1985 and 1989 1712 patients underwent open heart surgery and 4 female patients suffered from intestinal ischemia. The early mortality was 2.5% for the whole group and 100% for the group with intestinal ischemia. All these 4 patients were elderly and had a history of hypertension and hyperlipoproteinemia. Three of the four patients with intestinal ischemia had various risk factors for thromboembolic events such as pre-existing occlusive arterial disease and cardiac dysrhythmias or had a complicated postoperative course. In two patients an enormous increase in serum lactate to over 10 mmol/l occurred prior to the intestinal ischemia. We therefore consider advancing age, female gender and a susceptibility for thromboembolic events as important risk factors for the development of intestinal ischemia. A serum lactate over 10 mmol/l should lead to an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach including exploratory laparotomy.\r"

Tubules were perfused with an ultrafiltrate-like solution and bathed in a serum-like albumin solution. Neither a physiologic (5 x 10(-10) M), nor a pharmacologic (5 x 10(-8) M) dose of growth hormone had an effect on PCT phosphate or bicarbonate transport, or volume absorption. Addition of 5 x 10(-9) M and 5 x 10(-8) M IGF-I, but not 5 x 10(-10) M IGF-I, to the bathing solution resulted in an increase (12-15%) in phosphate transport, but no change in volume absorption or bicarbonate transport. Addition of IGF-I to the luminal perfusate also stimulated phosphate transport. The effect was noted at a concentration of 5 x 10(-11) M IGF-I (27% stimulation) and was maximal at a concentration of 5 x 10(-10) M IGF-I (46% stimulation). There was no effect of luminal IGF-I on volume absorption or bicarbonate transport. These data indicate that growth hormone has no direct effect on PCT transport. In the PCT, IGF-I stimulates phosphate transport specifically and acts via both basolateral and apical membranes. However, the magnitude of the maximal response to the luminal addition of IGF-I was threefold greater than that measured upon addition of the hormone to the bath, and the stimulation occurred at a 100-fold lower concentration. These data are consistent with IGF-I mediating the in vivo stimulation of phosphate transport by growth hormone.\r"

The number of sodium channels was assessed with a radioligand assay using the sodium channel-specific toxin [3H]batrachotoxinin benzoate ([3H]BTXB). The administration of mexiletine to rats induced a dose-dependent increase in [3H]BTXB total specific binding (Bmax) on isolated cardiac myocytes. Sodium channel numbers were 15 +/- 5, 29 +/- 9, and 54 +/- 4 fmol/10(5) cells after 3 d treatment with 0, 50 mg/kg per d, and 150 mg/kg per d mexiletine (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance). Sodium channel number increased monoexponentially to a steady-state value within 3 d with a half-time of increase of 1.0 d. After cessation of treatment with mexiletine the number of sodium channels returned to normal within 12 d. Finally, treatment with mexiletine altered only sodium channel number; the Kd for [3H]BTXB and the IC50 for mexiletine were not different for myocytes prepared from control and mexiletine-treated rats.\r"

However, the cells involved in production of complement have not been identified. In this study metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) synthesize a 180-kD precursor of C3 that is secreted after proteolytic cleavage into a disulphide linked two-chain molecule as found in plasma. C3 present in culture supernatants of PTEC was functionally active, however, during the culture period there was a partial inactivation of the C3 molecule as assessed by hemolytic titration. Recombinant IL-2 enhances the rate of C3 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner reaching maximal stimulation at doses of 200-400 U/ml IL-2. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a 5.2-kb C3 mRNA species present in PTEC that was increased within 24 h of IL-2 treatment. IL-2-induced enhancement of C3 production by PTEC could be neutralized with specific antibodies to IL-2. This study demonstrates that C3 synthesis in PTEC is upregulated by IL-2, the major cytokine produced by activated T cells.\r"

We wondered if glucocorticoids might induce expression of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors, which could contribute to the increased sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle to catecholamines that may occur with glucocorticoid excess. We examined the effects of dexamethasone on the expression of the alpha 1B adrenergic receptor gene in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. Dexamethasone (10(-6) M) produced a 1.8 +/- 0.2-fold increase in expression of alpha 1B receptors determined with [3H]prazosin. Steady-state values of alpha 1B adrenergic receptor mRNA, analyzed by Northern blotting, increased 2.8 +/- 0.7-fold after 48 h exposure to dexamethasone. This effect of dexamethasone occurred in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. alpha 1B receptor mRNA abundance was also increased by testosterone and aldosterone, whereas beta estradiol and progesterone had no effect. The alpha 1B receptor gene transcription rate, determined in nuclear run-off assays, increased 2.6 +/- 0.6-fold in cells treated with dexamethasone for 24 h. The half-life of the alpha 1B receptor mRNA was unchanged by dexamethasone. These data indicate that glucocorticoids regulate expression of alpha 1B receptors by increasing the rate of transcription of this gene.\r"

Sensitive Clark-type O2 microelectrodes were inserted into renal cortex and medulla of anesthetized rats. The inhibitor of NO formation, L-NG-monomethylarginine (LNMMA), while increasing blood pressure and reducing renal blood flow, decreased medullary pO2 from 23 +/- 3 mmHg to 12 +/- 3 (P less than 0.001), with no change in the cortex. These responses were promptly reversed by L-arginine, which bypasses the LNMMA blockade. In isolated rat kidneys, LNMMA reduced perfusion flow without altering glomerular filtration rate, and augmented deep medullary hypoxic injury to thick ascending limbs from 68 to 90% of the tubules (P less than 0.02). These changes were prevented by L-arginine. Nitroprusside had a protective effect upon thick limb injury. Finally, in a previously reported model of radiocontrast nephropathy (1988. J. Clin. Invest. 82:401), LNMMA increased the severity of renal failure (final plasma creatinine from 2.3 +/- 2 mg% to 3.4 +/- 3, P less than 0.005) and the proportion of damaged thick limbs (from 24 +/- 6% to 53 +/- 9, P less than 0.01). Nitrovasodilatation may participate in the balance of renal medullary oxygenation and play an important role in the prevention of medullary hypoxic injury.\r"

Net magnesium absorption was measured in normal subjects after they ingested a standard meal supplemented with 0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mEq of magnesium acetate. Although absorption increased with each increment in intake, fractional magnesium absorption fell progressively (from 65% at the lowest to 11% at the highest intake) so that absorption as a function of intake was curvilinear. This absorption-intake relationship was almost perfectly represented by an equation containing a hyperbolic function plus a linear function. Our results are statistically compatible with a magnesium absorption process that simultaneously uses a mechanism that reaches an absorptive maximum, plus a mechanism that endlessly absorbs a defined fraction (7%) of ingested magnesium. Compared to previous studies of calcium absorption, much less magnesium that calcium was absorbed at intakes above 8 mEq/meal, apparently due to greater restriction of intestinal permeability to magnesium. We also found that magnesium from a high magnesium-containing food source, almonds, was just as bioavailable as from soluble magnesium acetate. In contrast, magnesium absorption from commercially available enteric-coated magnesium chloride was much less than from magnesium acetate, suggesting that enteric coating can impair magnesium bioavailability.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumocystis carinii is an extracellular organism which is thought to require attachment to alveolar epithelial cells for its growth and replication in humans. Fibronectin (Fn) binding to P. carinii is essential for optimal P. carinii attachment. This study demonstrates that gp120, a 110-120-kD membrane glycoprotein on P. carinii, mediates attachment of the organism to cultured lung cells and is the site of Fn binding to P. carinii. A 51Cr-labeled P. carinii binding assay was used to quantify attachment of the organism to the alveolar epithelial cell line A549. Addition of free gp120, purified from whole P. carinii organisms, caused a significant decrease in attachment of P. carinii to A549 cells from 44.2 +/- 5.5% to 22.4 +/- 4.2% (P less than 0.01). Preincubation of the P. carinii organisms with a polyclonal antibody to gp120 also resulted in a marked decrease in P. carinii attachment to A549 cells from 46.8% +/- 5.2% to 21.3 +/- 4.8% (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, addition of free gp120 to P. carinii organisms caused a significant reduction in specific binding of 125I-Fn to P. carinii (from 83.3 +/- 8.5 ng to 47.1 +/- 5.9 ng, P less than 0.01). Similarly, anti-gp 120 antibody decreased specific Fn binding to P. carinii from 74.3 +/- 8.4 ng to 25.5 +/- 5.3 ng (P less than 0.001). Solubilized P. carinii organisms separated by gel electrophoresis and blotted with 125I-Fn demonstrated specific binding of the 125I-Fn to gp120. In addition, a specific anti-beta 1-integrin antiserum reacted with gp120 by Western blot, suggesting structural homology between gp120 and the beta-subunit of integrins. Thus, the data suggest that the P. carinii membrane glycoprotein gp120 functions as a Fn binding protein and is required for optimal P. carinii attachment to alveolar epithelial cells.\r"

Feeders stably producing 7 ng/ml IL-3, or LTC to which 10 ng/ml IL-3 was added daily for 5 wk, but not once or twice weekly for the same time period, increased the output of mature nonadherent cells and progenitors from LTC as compared to control cultures. At the time of the weekly half-medium change, when primitive clonogenic progenitors in the adherent layer of standard LTC are quiescent, such cells were actively cycling in cultures containing a continuous source of an adequate dose of IL-3. In LTC, where the proportion of IL-3-producing cells in the feeder layer was diluted to 10% and no IL-3 was detectable in culture medium, primitive adherent layer progenitors were, nevertheless, maintained as a population of continuously proliferating cells. Thus, the presence of IL-3 in LTC can enhance the proliferation and differentiation of very early human hematopoietic cells, but the concentration, duration of exposure, and method of IL-3 presentation are important determinants of the ultimate effects observed.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of osmotic water permeability (Pf) by vasopressin (VP) in kidney collecting tubule involves the exocytic-endocytic trafficking of vesicles containing water channels between an intracellular compartment and apical plasma membrane. To examine effects of transcellular water flow on vesicle movement, Pf was measured with 1-s time resolution in the isolated perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubule in response to addition and removal of VP (250 microU/ml) in the presence of bath greater than lumen (B greater than L), lumen greater than bath (L greater than B), and lumen = bath (L = B) osmolalities. With VP addition, Pf increased from 12 to 240-270 x 10(-4) cm/s (37 degrees C) in 10 min. At 1 min, Pf was approximately 70 x 10(-4) cm/s for B greater than L, L greater than B, and L = B conditions. At later times, Pf increased fastest for L greater than B and slowest for B greater than L osmolalities; at 5 min, Pf was 250 x 10(-4) cm/s (L greater than B) and 158 x 10(-4) cm/s (B greater than L). With VP removal, Pf returned to pre-VP levels at the fastest rate for B greater than L and the slowest rate for L greater than B osmolalities; at 30 min, Pf was 65 x 10(-4) cm/s (B greater than L) and 183 x 10(-4) cm/s (L greater than B). For a series of osmotic gradients of different magnitudes and directions, the rates of Pf increase and decrease were dependent upon the magnitude of transcellular volume flow; control studies showed that paracellular water flux, asymmetric transcellular water pathways, or changes in cell volume could not account for the data. VP-dependent endocytosis was measured by apical uptake of rhodamine-dextran; in paired studies where the same tubule was used for + and - gradients, B greater than L and L greater than B osmolalities gave 168% and 82% of uptake measured with no gradient. In contrast, endocytosis in proximal tubule was not dependent on gradient direction. These data provide evidence that transcellular volume flow modulates the vasopressin-dependent cycling of vesicles containing water channels, suggesting a novel driving mechanism to aid or oppose the targeted, hormonally directed movement of subcellular membranes.\r"

Under control conditions (Na HCO3- = 13 mM, perfusion rate approximately 17 nl/min-1) net bicarbonate transport (JHCO3-) was unsaturated, flow- and concentration-dependent, and increased linearly until a bicarbonate load of 1,400 pmol.min-1 was reached. Methazolamide (2 x 10(-4) M) reduced JHCO3 by 70%; the amiloride analogue ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) (2 x 10(-4) M) reduced JHCO3 by 40%; neither methazolamide nor EIPA affected net water flux (Jv). The H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (10(-5) M) reduced JHCO3 by 20%; the Cl- channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2'-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (2 x 10(-4) M) and the Cl(-)-base exchange inhibitor diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate (5 x 10(-5) M), had no effect on fractional bicarbonate reabsorption. Bumetanide (10(-6) M) stimulated bicarbonate transport (net and fractional JHCO3-) by 20%, whereas furosemide (10(-4) M) had no effect on bicarbonate reabsorption; both diuretics reduced Jv. In summary: (a) the LOH contributes significantly to urine acidification. It normally reabsorbs an amount equivalent to 15% of filtered bicarbonate; (b) bicarbonate reabsorption is not saturated; (c) Na(+)-H+ exchange and an ATP-dependent proton pump are largely responsible for the bulk of LOH bicarbonate transport.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether measurement of integrated backscatter could be used detect the progressive transmural shift of myofiber alignment that occurs from epicardium to endocardium in human ventricular wall segments. Integrated backscatter was measured at 32 transmural levels in seven cylindrical biopsy specimens (1.4 cm diam) sampled from normal regions of six explanted fixed human hearts by insonification of samples at 180 independent angles in 2 degrees steps around their entire circumference with a 5-MHz broadband piezoelectric transducer. Histologic analysis was performed to determine fiber orientation. Integrated backscatter varied approximately as a sinusoidal function of the angle of insonification at each transmural level. Greater integrated backscatter was observed for insonification perpendicular as compared with parallel to fibers (difference = 14.5 +/- 0.6 dB). Ultrasonic analysis revealed a progressive transmural shift in fiber orientation of approximately 9.2 +/- 0.7 degrees/mm of tissue. Histologic analysis revealed a concordant shift in fiber orientation of 7.9 +/- 0.8 degrees/mm of tissue. Thus, human myocardium manifests anisotropy of ultrasonic scattering that may be useful for characterization of the intramural fiber alignment and overall three-dimensional organization of cardiac myofibers.\r"

  ".W": "Prostacyclin is a critical mediator of structure and function in the pulmonary circulation, causing both the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth and vasodilation via the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. To examine the potential role of alterations in prostacyclin production or mechanism of action in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we determined the effects of prolonged (7 d) in vivo hypoxia on in vitro prostacyclin synthesis and mediation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat main pulmonary arteries. In control arteries prostacyclin production exceeded that of prostaglandin (PG) E2 by 25-fold, with 42% originating from the endothelium. Studies utilizing indomethacin revealed that endogenous prostaglandins mediate at least 69% of basal adenylate cyclase activity. Prostacyclin-stimulated enzyme activity was enhanced by exogenous GTP, indicating that this is a receptor-mediated process involving G protein amplification. Comparable dose-related responses to prostacyclin and PGE2 suggest that these agents may activate a common receptor. After 7 d of in vivo hypoxia there was a 2.7-fold increase in in vitro prostacyclin production, with equivalent increases in synthesis in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. However, despite this increase there was no change in basal adenylate cyclase activity, and this was associated with attenuated sensitivity of the enzyme to prostacyclin stimulation. Concomitant diminution of the response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, with previously-demonstrated beta receptor downregulation and unaltered postreceptor-mediated activity, suggests that the blunted response to prostacyclin is due to receptor downregulation. Parallel studies of the thoracic aorta indicated that these changes are specific to the pulmonary artery. It is postulated that attenuation of the response of adenylate cyclase to prostacyclin may contribute to the structural changes and hypertension observed in the pulmonary vasculature of the rat with chronic hypoxia.\r"

Secretion of IGF-I immunoreactivity by cells from TC-1 murine bone marrow stromal cells was time-dependent and inhibited by cycloheximide. Gel filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions of TC-1 conditioned medium demonstrated two major peaks of apparent IGF-I immunoreactivity with molecular weights of approximately 7.5-8.0 kD, the size of native IGF-I, and greater than 25 kD. Expression of IGF-I mRNA was identified by both RNase protection assay and reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether the greater than 25-kD species identified by RIA possessed IGF-binding activity, a potential cause of artifactual IGF-I immunoreactivity, charcoal adsorption assay of these gel filtration fractions was performed. The peak of IGF-binding activity coeluted with apparent IGF-I immunoreactivity suggesting that TC-1 cells secrete IGF-binding protein(s). Unfractionated conditioned medium exhibited linear dose-dependent increase in specific binding of [125I]-IGF-I with a pattern of displacement (IGF-I and IGF-II much greater than insulin) characteristic of IGF-binding proteins. Western ligand analysis of conditioned medium showed three IGF-I binding species of approximately 31, 38, and 40 kD. These data indicate that TC-1 bone marrow stromal cells synthesize and secrete IGF-I and IGF-binding proteins and constitute a useful model system to study their regulation and role in hematopoiesis.\r"

We extended the observation of self-binding anti-PC antibodies to naturally occurring human anti-PC antibodies. Anti-PC antibodies were purified from normal donor sera and shown to bind to monoclonal antiidiotypic anti-T15 antibodies originally raised against the murine T15 idiotype. These human antibodies are self-binding which is inhibitable by the PC hapten and the murine T15 (50-73)-derived Vh peptide. The anti-PC antibodies were further separated into id-positive and id-negative anti-PC antibodies. Only the T15 id-positive preparation was self-binding. These findings demonstrate an evolutionary, conserved biological property between mouse and man associated with a naturally occurring antibacterial antibody. This conserved biological and structural property may have been selected in evolution because it is part of an important immune defense mechanism against bacterial and other environmental pathogens.\r"

All the heterozygotes had a raised level of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, but were remarkably free from premature coronary disease. Determination of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) phenotype and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration in plasma revealed that in many instances, involving individuals with various apo(a) phenotypes, there was no difference in plasma Lp(a) concentration between an FH heterozygote and an unaffected sibling with the same apo(a) phenotype. No significant difference in Lp(a) concentration was observed between groups of FH and non-FH of the same apo(a) phenotype, although in each case the mean value for the FH group was greater than that for the non-FH group. There was also evidence for an inherited trait that markedly increased Lp(a) concentration, which did not segregate with apo(a) phenotype or the defective LDL-receptor allele. The data provide no evidence for a strong multiplicative interaction between the gene loci for apo(a) and the LDL receptor.\r"

We report here that tryptase, a trypsin-like serine proteinase of mast cell secretory granules, is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts in vitro. Nanomolar concentrations of dog tryptase strongly stimulate thymidine incorporation in Chinese hamster lung and Rat-1 fibroblasts and increase cell density in both subconfluent and confluent cultures of these cell lines. Tryptase-induced cell proliferation appears proteinase-specific, as this response is not mimicked by pancreatic trypsin or mast cell chymase. In addition, low levels of tryptase markedly potentiate DNA synthesis stimulated by epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, or insulin. Inhibitors of catalytic activity decrease the mitogenic capacity of tryptase, suggesting, though not proving, the participation of the catalytic site in cell activation by tryptase. Differences in Ca++ mobilization and sensitivity to pertussis toxin suggest that tryptase and thrombin activate distinct signal transduction pathways in fibroblasts. These data implicate mast cell tryptase as a potent, previously unrecognized fibroblast growth factor, and may provide a molecular link between mast cell activation and fibrosis.\r"

In these conditions an increased cardiovascular reactivity to noradrenaline (NA) and angiotensin II (AII) can be observed. Using the euglycemic clamp technique, we determined the cardiovascular reactivity to graded infusions of NA and AII in nine healthy males before (Bas), and 1 and 6 h after infusion of insulin (50 mU/kg per h) was started. On separate days control experiments were carried out to control for any circadian variation. Insulin led to a decrease of the amount of circulating NA necessary to increase the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 20 mmHg (actual experiment [mean +/- SEM]: Bas, 23.1 +/- 5.0; 1 h, 14.8 +/- 3.0; and 6 h, 12.3 +/- 3.1; and control experiment: Bas, 20.7 +/- 5.0; 1 h, 18.6 +/- 3.5; and 6 h, 17.3 +/- 3.3 nmol/liter; Bas vs. 1 and 6 h: P less than 0.05). Although the amount of NA infused to raise DBP 20 mmHg showed a similar decline after 1 h of insulin infusion, no such change from baseline could be observed at 6 h. This appeared to be due to an increase in NA clearance with more prolonged insulin infusion. Insulin exerted no effect on the amount of AII infused to increase DBP 20 mmHg (actual experiment: Bas, 27.6 +/- 6.4; 1 h, 28.8 +/- 10.0; and 6 h, 21.2 +/- 5.3; and control experiment: Bas, 33.6 +/- 5.7; 1 h, 34.2 +/- 6.1; and 6 h, 23.4 +/- 4.7 ng/kg/min; NS). We did observe a circadian variation in AII reactivity. Whether the increase in cardiovascular responsiveness to NA after administration of insulin contributes to the elevation in blood pressure frequently observed in patients with insulin resistance remains to be proven.\r"

To define the relationship between gene mutations and enzyme deficiency, we generated missense mutations of the 21-hydroxylase cDNA at three different sites and characterized the mutant proteins after expressing them in cultured mammalian and yeast cells. Among them, Ser268 and Val281 have been found to be mutated in CAH patients, whereas Cys428 has been implicated as the heme ligand. Our results show mutations at these sites result in complete, partial, or no loss of the enzymatic activity. All the Cys428 mutants had neither enzymatic activity nor P450 absorption, thus supporting the notion that Cys428 is the heme ligand. All the 268-mutants exhibited the same activity as normal 21-hydroxylase, demonstrating that the clinically observed Ser268----Thr change represents a polymorphism rather than the cause of the enzyme deficiency. The 281-mutants had normal Km but greatly reduced Vmax values that also paralleled the reduction in the heme content, in the order Val281 (normal, 100%) greater than Ile281 (50%) greater than Leu281 (20%) greater than Thr281 (10%). Our findings suggest that the methyl group at the beta-carbon of Val281 is required for heme incorporation and consequently enzymatic activity.\r"

In the diabetic group, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR, iothalamate clearance) exceeded the control value by 15% (140 +/- 6 vs. 122 +/- 5 ml/min, P less than 0.01). A corresponding 12% increase in renal plasma flow (RPF) was not statistically significant and did not account fully for the observed hyperfiltration, suggesting a concomitant elevation of the ultrafiltration pressure or coefficient. The median albumin excretion ratio in NIDDM exceeded control by almost twofold (10.1 vs. 5.8 mg/g creatinine), a trend which just failed to achieve statistical significance (P = 0.06). Fractional clearances of dextrans of broad size distribution were also elevated in diabetic subjects, significantly so for larger dextrans of between 48 and 60 A radius. A theoretical analysis of dextran transport through a heteroporous membrane revealed glomerular pores in NIDDM to be uniformly shifted towards pores of larger size than in controls. We conclude that an impairment of barrier size selectivity combined with high GFR elevates the filtered protein load in NIDDM of recent onset. We propose that enhanced transglomerular trafficking of protein may predispose to sclerosis of glomeruli in those Pima Indians with NIDDM who ultimately develop diabetic nephropathy.\r"

We have determined the effect of changes in PA production on O2 consumption in intact PMN and the level of NADPH oxidase activity measured in a cell-free assay. Pretreatment of cells with various concentrations of propranolol enhanced (less than or equal to 200 microM) or inhibited (greater than 300 microM) PLD-induced production of PA (mass and radiolabel) in a manner that correlated with enhancement or inhibition of O2 consumption in PMN stimulated with 1 microM FMLP in the absence of cytochalasin B. The concentration-dependent effects of propranolol on FMLP-induced NADPH oxidase activation was confirmed by direct assay of the enzyme in subcellular fractions. In PA extracted from cells pretreated with 200 microM propranolol before stimulation with 1 microM FMLP, phospholipase A1 (PLA1)-digestion for 90 min, followed by quantitation of residual PA, showed that a minimum of 44% of PA in control (undigested) sample was diacyl-PA; alkylacyl-PA remained undigested by PLA1. Propranolol was also observed to have a concentration-dependent enhancement of mass of 1,2-DG formed in PMN stimulated with FMLP. DG levels reached a maximum at 300 microM propranolol and remained unchanged up to 500 microM propranolol. However, in contrast to PA levels, the level of DG produced did not correlate with NADPH oxidase activation. Exogenously added didecanoyl-PA activated NADPH oxidase in a concentration-dependent manner (1-300 microM) in a reconstitution assay using membrane and cytosolic fractions from unstimulated PMN. In addition, PA synergized with SDS for oxidase activation. Taken together, these results indicate that PA plays a second messenger role in the activation of NADPH oxidase in human PMN and that regulation of phospholipase D is a key step in the activation pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) integrin is a cell surface receptor involved in the interaction of lymphoid cells with both extracellular matrix (ECM) and endothelial cells. We have investigated the expression and function of VLA-4 fibronectin (FN) receptors on T cells localized in the inflammed synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A high proportion of T cells in both synovial membrane (SM) and synovial fluid (SF) expressed the activation antigens AIM (CD69) and gp95/85 (Ea2) as well as an increased number of VLA-4 alpha and beta 1 adhesion molecules, as compared with peripheral blood (PB) T cells from the same patients. Furthermore, the majority of these activated SF T cells were able to adhere to a 38-kD FN proteolytic fragment containing the connecting segment-1 (CS-1) specifically through VLA-4 receptors, whereas a significantly lower proportion of PB T cells displayed this capacity. Therefore, our results show that activated T cells selectively localize at sites of tissue injury in RA disease and provide evidence for the in vivo regulation of the expression and function of the VLA-4 integrin. This regulatory mechanism may enable T cells either to facilitate migration or to persist at sites of inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous apolipoprotein E in VLDL is poorly expressed in receptor binding processes. Yet catabolism of VLDL-remnants by cellular receptors depends on functional apo E molecules. To better understand remnant catabolism phenomena, we determined the metabolism of VLDL and post-lipolysis VLDL by cultured cells. Partial lipolysis was achieved by incubation of VLDL with lipoprotein lipase in vitro (human) or recirculation (rat) in supradiaphragmatic animals. Lipolyzed VLDL exhibit metabolic activities 2-20-fold higher than control VLDL, that are saturable and dependent on the presence of LDL receptors. The ligand responsible for receptor interaction of lipolyzed VLDL (apo E or apo B-100) and its source (endogenous or transferred) was studied with monoclonal antibodies and with lipoproteins from E-3/3 and E-2/2 subjects. The data unequivocally proved that lipolysis causes exposure of unreactive endogenous apo E-3 at the VLDL surface, possibly by a change of conformation of the protein. Apo B-100 becomes biologically expressed only in lipolyzed VLDL-III. Lipolyzed VLDL, however, is less reactive to exogenous apo E-3 than control VLDL indicating that endogenous and exogenous apo E are oriented differently in VLDL. It is proposed that VLDL delivers triglycerides to tissues when apo E is unreactive but becomes a remnant after the protein becomes exposed and directs the particles from lipoprotein lipase sites to cellular receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in eight clinically stable cirrhotic patients and in 12 controls. OGTT was normal in cirrhotics but plasma insulin response was increased approximately twofold compared with controls. Subjects received a three-step (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mU/kg.min) euglycemic insulin clamp with indirect calorimetry, [6-3H]-glucose, and [1-14C]-palmitate. During the two highest insulin infusion steps glucose uptake was impaired (3.33 +/- 0.31 vs. 5.06 +/- 0.40 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01, and 6.09 +/- 0.50 vs. 7.95 +/- 0.52 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01). Stimulation of glucose oxidation by insulin was normal; in contrast, nonoxidative glucose disposal (i.e., glycogen synthesis) was markedly reduced. Fasting (r = -0.553, P less than 0.01) and glucose-stimulated (r = -0.592, P less than 0.01) plasma insulin concentration correlated inversely with the severity of insulin resistance. Basal hepatic glucose production was normal in cirrhotics and suppressed normally with insulin. In postabsorptive state, plasma FFA conc (933 +/- 42 vs. 711 +/- 44 mumol/liter, P less than 0.01) and FFA turnover (9.08 +/- 1.20 vs. 6.03 +/- 0.53 mumol/kg.min, P less than 0.01) were elevated in cirrhotics despite basal hyperinsulinemia; basal FFA oxidation was similar in cirrhotic and control subjects. With low-dose insulin infusion, plasma FFA oxidation and turnover failed to suppress normally in cirrhotics. During the two higher insulin infusion steps, all parameters of FFA metabolism suppressed normally. In summary, stable cirrhotic patients with normal glucose tolerance exhibit marked insulin resistance secondary to the impaired nonoxidative glucose disposal. Our results suggest that chronic hyperinsulinism may be responsible for the insulin resistance observed in cirrhosis.\r"

The present work has examined EGR gene expression during differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells along the monocytic lineage and in activated monocytes. Low levels of EGR-1 transcripts were detectable in untreated U-937 and HL-60 leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment of these cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was associated with increases (within 1 h) in EGR-1 mRNA levels. The induction of monocytic differentiation by TPA and other agents was further associated with increases in EGR-2, but not EGR-3 or EGR-4, mRNA levels in these cells. Treatment of resting peripheral blood monocytes with the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was also associated with rapid (within 15 min) increases in expression of the EGR-1 and EGR-2 genes. The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that EGR-1 mRNA levels are increased in part by transcriptional activation of this gene in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes. The results also demonstrate that both EGR-1 and EGR-2 mRNA levels are regulated at the posttranscriptional level by a labile protein that destabilizes these transcripts. Finally, we demonstrate that dexamethasone, an inhibitor of monocytic differentiation, blocks the associated increases in EGR-1 and EGR-2 expression. Taken together, the results indicate that the EGR-1 and EGR-2 early response genes are involved in the induction of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation along the monocytic lineage and in the activation of human monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the source(s) of carbon for the indirect pathway of hepatic glycogen synthesis, we studied nine 42-h fasted conscious dogs given a continuous intraduodenal infusion of glucose, labeled with [1-13C]glucose and [3-3H]glucose, at 8 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 240 min. Glycogen formation by the direct pathway was measured by 13C-NMR. Net hepatic balances of glucose, gluconeogenic amino acids, lactate, and glycerol were determined using the arteriovenous difference technique. During the steady-state period (the final hour of the infusion), 81% of the glucose infused was absorbed as glucose. Net gut output of lactate and alanine accounted for 5% and 3% of the glucose infused, respectively. The cumulative net hepatic uptakes were: glucose, 15.5 +/- 3.8 g; gluconeogenic amino acids, 32.2 +/- 2.2 mmol (2.9 +/- 0.2 g of glucose equivalents); and glycerol, 6.1 +/- 0.9 mmol (0.6 +/- 0.1 g of glucose equivalents). The liver produced a net of 29.2 +/- 9.6 mmol of lactate (2.6 +/- 0.8 g of glucose equivalents). Net hepatic glycogen synthesis totaled 9.3 +/- 2.5 g (1.8 +/- 0.4 g/100 g liver), with the direct pathway being responsible for 57 +/- 10%. Thus, net hepatic glucose uptake was sufficient to account for all glycogen formed by both the direct and indirect pathways. Total net hepatic uptake of gluconeogenic precursors (gluconeogenic amino acids, glycerol, and lactate) was able to account for only 20% of net glycogen synthesis by the indirect pathway. In a net sense, our data are consistent with an intrahepatic origin for most of the three-carbon precursors used for indirect glycogen synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of PMN with inflammatory mediators markedly augments Fc and CR1 receptor-mediated ingestion. However, CD11/CD18-deficient PMN from three patients with complete leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) failed to recruit phagocytic function in response to phorbol esters, cytokine, or Arg-Gly-Asp-containing ligand stimulation. Because stimulated ingestion is protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent, our data indicate that LAD PMN exhibit only PKC-independent phagocytosis. The defect in PKC-dependent ingestion is specific for CD11b/CD18 and not secondary to the chronic or recurrent infections which occur in this disease. The LAD phenotype for phagocytic function can be reproduced in normal PMN by the anti-CD11b MAbs OKM1 and OKM10. In contrast, MAb Mo1 (anti-CD11b) and MAb IB4 (anti-CD18) inhibit both CD11b/CD18-dependent and -independent mechanisms of ingestion by normal PMN. Their ability to inhibit CD11b/CD18-independent ingestion may be mediated by cAMP, as shown by experiments with a protein kinase A inhibitor HA1004 and by direct measurement of cAMP levels in immune complex- and FMLP-stimulated PMN. These data indicate that CD11b/CD18-independent and -dependent mechanisms of phagocytosis exist and that some effects of anti-CD11b/CD18 MAbs may be mediated by alterations in cAMP levels.\r"

Intravenous infusion of a monoclonal rat anti-mouse IgE produced a marked tachycardia, diminutions in Cdyn and GL, and death in +/+ but not W/Wv mice, and +/+ mice sensitized to develop high circulating levels of IgE exhibited HR, Cdyn, and GL responses to rat anti-IgE challenge which were significantly less intense than those in nonimmunized +/+ mice. By contrast, virtually identical cardiopulmonary responses were observed in either +/+ or W/Wv mice challenged to elicit pure active anaphylactic responses or simultaneous active and anti-IgE-dependent anaphylaxis. These findings show that anaphylactic responses associated with significant tachycardia, reductions in Cdyn and GL, and death can occur in the virtual absence of tissue mast cells. This is true even though, in normal mice, such responses are associated with extensive degranulation of tissue mast cells. By contrast, certain models of anaphylaxis, such as that induced in nonsensitized mice by anti-mouse IgE, can not be elicited in the absence of mast cells.\r"

Splanchnic palmitate release was determined in 16 of these subjects. Results: total palmitate release was greater in UB Ob (P less than 0.005) than LB Ob or Non Ob women (161 +/- 16 vs. 111 +/- 9 vs. 92 +/- 9 mumol/min, respectively). Despite increased leg fat mass in obese women, leg palmitate release was similar in each group. Therefore, leg fat palmitate release was greater in Non Ob women than LB Ob (P less than 0.01) or UB Ob (P = 0.06) women (3.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg fat-1.min-1, respectively).

Splanchnic palmitate release accounted for 20-32% of upper body fat palmitate release in each group (P = NS between groups). Leg fat palmitate release was significantly less than upper body fat palmitate release. We conclude that the major difference in resting FFA metabolism between UB Ob and LB Ob women is the ability of the later to down-regulate upper body fat lipolysis to maintain normal FFA availability.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo effects of 300-min infusions of recombinant insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II on glucose and protein metabolism have been investigated in awake, fasted lambs. Two doses of recombinant human (rh) IGF-I were infused: 6.7 nmol/kg.h, which induced hypoglycemia, and 2.0 nmol/kg.h, which did not. The effects were compared with an insulin infusion (0.17 nmol/kg.h) that had the same hypoglycemic potential as the high dose rhIGF-I infusion. rhIGF-II was infused at a rate of 6.7 nmol/kg.h. Primed constant infusions of isotopically labeled glucose, urea and leucine tracers were used to determine glucose and protein kinetics. rhIGF-I lowered blood glucose by increasing the rate of glucose clearance (P less than 0.01), in contrast to insulin, which both increased clearance and reduced glucose production. Net protein loss was reduced after infusion of low and high dose rhIGF-I and insulin by 11% (P less than 0.05), 15% (P less than 0.01), and 12% (P less than 0.05), respectively. rhIGF-II infusion did not alter the rate of net protein loss. In contrast to insulin, high dose rhIGF-I infusion increased the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal (P less than 0.05) and cardiac muscle (P less than 0.01) and in hepatic tissue (P less than 0.05). We conclude that (a) protein metabolism is more sensitive than glucose metabolism to rhIGF-I infusion, as protein loss was reduced by an rhIGF-I infusion that did not alter glucose kinetics; (b) protein synthesis is increased by rhIGF-I infusion but not by insulin infusion; and (c) rhIGF-II is a less effective anabolic agent than rhIGF-I. We speculate that the effects of rhIGF-I on protein metabolism are not mediated by insulin receptors.\r"

A single intravenous injection of the antibody resulted in enhanced glomerular synthesis of thromboxane (Tx)B2, leukotriene (LT)B4, and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), whereas that of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha was either unaltered or impaired. The enhanced eicosanoid synthesis was associated with decrements in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF). Complement activation mediated both the increments in TxB2, LTB4, and 12-HETE and the decrements in GFR and RBF. The decrements in GFR were abolished by the TxA2 receptor antagonist SQ-29,548. Although both neutrophiles and Ia (+) leukocytes infiltrated glomeruli, glomerular LTB4 originated mainly from the latter. Platelets entirely accounted for the enhanced 12-HETE synthesis in isolated glomeruli and to a lesser extent for that of LTB4 and TxB2. Glomerular PGE2 and PGF2 alpha originated from mesangial cells as their impaired synthesis coincided with extensive mesangial cell lysis. The observations indicate that in mesangial cell immune injury vasoactive and proinflammatory eicosanoids originate from recruited or activated Ia (+) leukocytes and platelets and may exert paracrine effects on mesangial cells.\r"

During a systematic search for suitable, naturally occurring candidates an intracellular protein was isolated from the ribosomal pellet of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3, a bacterial strain associated with reactive arthritis in humans. The protein is highly cationic, contains two 19-kD polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, and reveals a strong tendency for spontaneous aggregation. It is suggested to be a nucleic acid binding protein. We tested this antigen for its ability to induce arthritis after intra-articular challenge in preimmunized rats. An acute inflammatory phase followed by transition to chronicity was observed both by technetium-99m scintigraphy and from histology. Massive polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration of the synovium was seen early on and fibrosis and thickening of the joint capsule occurred in later stages. Control groups showed no evidence of inflammation. Western blot and ELISA analysis of unselected sera from Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3-infected patients revealed antibodies to the antigen in the majority of cases, whereas healthy individuals rarely reacted. This is the first report of a naturally occurring cationic antigen capable of inducing immunologic tissue injury; it justifies the speculation that cationic antigens from prokaryotic cells could trigger reactive arthritis in humans.\r"

Genealogical studies revealed that these probands share common ancestry in the 17th century. In a group of 128 family members, spanning three generations, 37 additional heterozygous APOE*3-Leiden gene carriers were detected. Although with a variable degree of severity, all carriers exhibited characteristics of FD such as (a) elevated levels of cholesterol in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) fractions, (b) elevated ratios of cholesterol levels in these density fractions over total plasma levels of triglycerides, and (c) strongly increased plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that most of the variability in expression of FD in APOE*3-Leiden allele carriers can be explained by age. Body mass index showed a less significant influence on the expression of FD. Gender had no effect on the expression in E*3-Leiden allele carriers, nor did it influence the age of onset of FD. In the group of APOE*3-Leiden allele carriers, we found that the E*2 allele enhances the expression of FD, whereas the E*4 allele had the opposite effect. Isoelectric focusing of plasma and of isolated VLDL, IDL, and high density lipoprotein density fractions showed that in E*3-Leiden allele carriers the apoE3-Leiden variant largely predominates over its normal apoE counterpart, especially in the VLDL and IDL density fractions. We conclude that in APOE*3-Leiden allele carriers FD is dominantly inherited with a high rate of penetrance, i.e., the presence of normally functioning apoE molecules in the plasma does not prevent the age-related expression of this disease.\r"

Therefore we studied taurine transport in MDCK cells grown on porous supports and then studied the effect of hypertonicity which is known to elicit increased uptake of some other nonperturbing osmolytes by MDCK cells. Basal uptake exceeded apical uptake, with Km and Vmax of 56 microM and 933 pmol/min.mg protein on the basal surface and 10 microM and 50 pmol/min.mg protein on the apical surface. On both surfaces, virtually all taurine uptake was Na+ and Cl- dependent. 24 h after cells were shifted to hypertonic medium (500 mosmol/kg), taurine uptake doubled on the basolateral surface without change on the apical surface. The response to hypertonicity was the result of an increase in Vmax without change in Km. There was no change in taurine efflux when cells were shifted from isotonic to hypertonic medium. When cells adapted to hypertonic medium were shifted to isotonic medium, a large transient basolateral efflux of taurine occurred within 10 min. We conclude that taurine can function as a nonperturbing osmolyte in MDCK cells and that tonicity-regulated taurine transport is a basolateral function in MDCK cells.\r"

  ".W": "In patients dying with acute lung injury, interstitial mesenchymal cells migrate into the airspace where they replicate and deposit connective tissue. We therefore hypothesized that peptides capable of promoting mesenchymal cell migration and replication would be present in the alveolar airspace. To examine this hypothesis, patients with severe acute diffuse lung injury (n = 26) underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Acutely ill patients without lung injury served as controls (n = 12). Recovered effluent was examined for mesenchymal cell growth-promoting and migration-promoting activity. Lavage cell supernates from both patients and controls were devoid of bioactivity. However, substantial growth-promoting and migration-promoting activity was present in lavage fluid from nearly every patient, whereas little or none was present in fluid from controls. Characterization of the bioactivity indicated a significant proportion consisted of three peptides related to PDGF: (a) a 14-kD peptide that shared with PDGF several biophysical, biochemical, receptor-binding, and antigenic properties; (b) a 29-kD peptide that appeared identical to PDGF of platelet origin; and (c) a 38-kD peptide that was biophysically and antigenically similar to PDGF. These data indicate that peptide moieties are present in the airspace of patients after acute lung injury that can signal mesenchymal cell migration and replication.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of alveolar oxygen tension on lung lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia was evaluated by using isolated rat lungs perfused with synthetic medium. After a 5-min equilibration period, global ischemia was produced by discontinuing perfusion while ventilation continued with gas mixtures containing 5% CO2 and a fixed oxygen concentration between 0 and 95%. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of tissue thiobarbituric acid-reactive products and conjugated dienes. Control studies (no ischemia) showed no change in parameters of lipid peroxidation during 1 h of perfusion and ventilation with 20% or 95% O2. With 60 min of ischemia, there was increased lipid peroxidation which varied with oxygen content of the ventilating gas and was markedly inhibited by ventilation with N2. Perfusion with 5-, 8-, 11-, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid indicated that generation of eicosanoids during ischemia accounted for approximately 40-50% of lung lipid peroxide production. Changes of CO2 content of the ventilating gas (to alter tissue pH) or of perfusate glucose concentration had no effect on lipid peroxidation during ischemia, but perfusion at 8% of the normal flow rate prevented lipid peroxidation. Lung dry/wet weight measured after 3 min of reperfusion showed good correlation between lung fluid accumulation and lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that reperfusion is not necessary for lipid peroxidation with ischemic insult of the lung and provide evidence that elevated PO2 during ischemia accelerates the rate of tissue injury.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing evidence suggests that autoantibodies in the rheumatic diseases are a consequence of immune selection by self-material, but the nature of the in vivo immunogen is unknown. Insight into this problem may be obtained by measuring autoantibody binding to various forms of a target antigen. Antihistone antibodies arising as a side effect of therapy with various drugs offer an opportunity to explore this premise because many forms of histone have been characterized and adapted to ELISA formats. Two patterns of antibody reactivity were observed. All 21 patients with symptomatic procainamide-induced lupus and 7 of 12 patients with quinidine-induced lupus had IgG antibodies reacting predominantly with the (H2A-H2B)-DNA complex and with chromatin. In contrast, antibodies in 19 of 24 patients taking procainamide without accompanying lupus-like symptoms did not show any pattern. The second pattern was observed in 18/19 chlorpromazine-treated patients and 14/17 patients with hydralazine-induced lupus in which IgM antibodies displayed more reactivity with DNA-free histones than with the corresponding histone-DNA complexes and almost no binding to H1-stripped chromatin. Absorption studies were entirely consistent with these results. Thus, the two patterns of reactivity with nucleosomal components reflect the molecular substructure of chromatin, suggesting that two processes underlie antihistone antibody induction by drugs. In one, IgG autoantibodies appear to be elicited by chromatin, whereas in the other, autoimmune tolerance to native chromatin appears largely intact, and IgM antibodies may be driven by DNA-free histone.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that treatment of mammalian cells with ionizing radiation is associated with activation of gene expression. Although the signal transduction pathways stimulated by ionizing radiation remain unclear, our previous findings indicate that radiation induces specific genes at the transcriptional level. The present work has examined the effects of ionizing radiation on the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The results demonstrate that ionizing radiation activates DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF)kappa B. This effect was detectable at 2 grays (Gy) and reached a maximum at 5-20 Gy. At a dose of 20 Gy, the increase in NF-kappa B binding activity was maximal at 2-4 h and then declined to pretreatment levels. The results also demonstrate that ionizing radiation transiently increases NF-kappa B mRNA levels. However, the finding that induction of NF-kappa B binding to DNA occurs in the presence of cycloheximide indicates that ionizing radiation activates preexisting NF-kappa B protein. NF-kappa B exists as a cytoplasmic protein before activation. Thus, our results suggest that ionizing radiation induces transduction pathways which include cytoplasmic signaling events.\r"

We investigated the IL-6 requirements for the growth of two human myeloma cell lines, U 266 and RPMI 8226. These cell lines secreted minute amounts of IL-6 (20 U/ml) and featured IL-6 mRNA. IL-6 receptors were detectable at the surface of malignant cells by immunofluorescence. Antibodies to IL-6 did not alter the proliferation of these myeloma cells. There was a dose-dependent decrease, however, in [3H]-thymidine uptake in the presence of IL-6 antisense (and not sense) oligodeoxynucleotides; in the presence of 20 microM IL-6 antisense, an 80 and 95% inhibition of the proliferation of U 266 and RPMI 8226 cells was observed, respectively. These results provide strong evidence for an IL-6 autocrine proliferation of myeloma cells which may occur via internal interaction between IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor.\r"

To investigate the failure of many ER-positive breast cancers to respond to antiestrogen therapy, we examined by gel-shift assay the ability of tumor ER to bind its cognate estrogen response element (ERE). Analysis of 38 primary breast cancers showed that some tumors containing abundant immunoreactive ER failed to demonstrate DNA binding ER. In many other ER-positive tumors, the fraction of DNA binding ER was low and consisted primarily of truncated receptor forms, which on Western analysis were revealed to be 50 kD homodimers and 67-50 kD ER heterodimers. The use of protease inhibitors during tumor extraction and the demonstration of nuclear-localizing ER and ERE-binding COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) protein in these tumors indicated that the truncated forms of ER were likely present in vivo. The presence of intact DNA binding ER correlated with higher tumor content of immunoreactive sex steroid receptors (ER and/or PR), standard predictors of tumor responsiveness to antiestrogen, suggesting that loss or truncation of DNA binding ER may be an important prognostic parameter accounting for some forms of clinical resistance to antiestrogen therapy.\r"

In this report, antibodies against CFTR peptides were used to localize the CFTR protein in human pancreas. An affinity purified antibody (alpha-1468) raised against a synthetic CFTR peptide identified a 155-170-kD protein on immunoblot. Cytochemical studies with alpha-1468 localized CFTR to small branching, tubular structures. The same structures were recognized by two other antibodies raised against different regions of the CFTR molecule. To identify the cells being stained, double-label immunofluorescence studies were performed using alpha-1468 and a monoclonal antibody which stains pancreatic centroacinar and intralobular duct cells. Both antibodies localized to the same population of cells, with alpha-1468 being confined to the apical domain of these cells. No conclusive staining of acinar cells was evident. These findings suggest that proximal duct epithelial cells play a key role in the early events leading to pancreatic insufficiency in CF, and imply that apical chloride transport by these cells is essential for normal pancreatic secretory function.\r"

We now report that low-dose irradiation permits the engraftment of BB rat fetal liver stem cells in scid recipients. We observed that BB rat fetal liver cells injected into irradiated scid mice establish a rat hemopoietic system in the scid mouse bone marrow and populate the scid mouse thymus. These stem cells generated rat-origin thymocytes that migrated to the scid mouse spleen, a peripheral lymphoid organ. Finally, we found that xenogeneic chimeras created using fetal liver cells from the abnormal (lymphopenic, diabetes prone) subline of BB rats recapitulated both the quantitative and phenotypic abnormalities of the donor rat. Xenogeneic lymphohemopoietic chimeras established in scid mice may provide a powerful new tool in the study of immune system development and autoimmunity.\r"

Macrophages were detected in all the samples studied and were located in the germinal matrix zone, in perivascular spaces throughout the brain, and in the leptomeninges and subependymal layer. Well differentiated microglia were present in all cases examined after 35 weeks' gestation and less well ramified forms were seen at earlier stages of gestation. HLA-DR antigens were detected on a small number of macrophages, chiefly in a perivascular location, in all but three cases. The fewest reactive cells and the weakest reactions occurred in the youngest fetuses. One case of SIDS showed increased foci of microglia in perivascular white matter: this case and one other case of SIDS were the only cases with well ramified microglia that expressed HLA-DR antigens. These findings may be relevant to an understanding of local immune responses in fetal brain infections, including human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

With mechanical isolation the percentage of positivity ranged from 85 to 100%, while with collagenase isolation it ranged from 22 to 49% on immediate testing, and from 53 to 80% after 24 hour incubation. Class II antigens were only detected in one patient with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and two with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Flow cytofluorimetric analysis in 11 cases confirmed class II or class I positivity, or both, on isolated hepatocytes, allowing MHC antigen expression on hepatocytes to be measured. Class I and II antigen detection on hepatocytes is influenced by the technique used. Although class I antigens are invariably expressed on hepatocytes, class II antigens are only found on hepatocytes from patients with immune mediated liver disorders.\r"

DNA suitable for the reaction was obtained from these tissues by simple extraction methods, without previous dewaxing of tissue sections. When compared with unfixed material, the reaction efficiency was compromised, so that an increased number of amplification cycles were required to produce equivalent amounts of amplified product. This in turn led to an increase in amplification artefacts, which can be minimised by a simple modification of the standard reaction. Amplification of relatively large DNA fragments was not always successful, and it seems prudent to bear this in mind when designing oligonucleotide primers which are to be used for the amplification of archival material. The efficiency of the procedure can be improved by dividing the amplification cycles into two parts: this reduces the amount of reagent needed, is relatively simple and inexpensive, and can be performed in one working day.\r"

Samples measured using the R1000 showed a negligible decrease in the reticulocyte count over five days at room temperature, although there was evidence of continuing intracellular maturation: with thiazole orange there was an apparent increase. A practical reference range of 20-70 x 10(9)/l was established from 89 normal subjects. The close correlation between the two independent estimates indicates the validity of the quantitation of the reticulocyte count and shows that automation allows significant changes within and below the normal range to be detected with a degree of reliability which was not previously possible.\r"

The addition of exogenous haem in several of the test samples resulted in a slight to pronounced increase in the alpha:beta ratios, particularly in group I. In 92% of the high risk cases (refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML] or 87.5% of patients who finally developed acute non-lyphoid leukaemia (ANLL) low or normal alpha:beta ratios were found. No significant correlation was noticed between alpha:beta ratios and various haematological variables or survival. It is concluded that in MDS the alpha:beta ratio varied enormously across the entire population of patients, as well as within each FAB subtype, thereby restricting its prognostic value. Although haem deficiency may be implicated in some cases of MDS, why this should be remains unclear.\r"

PAI-1 was localised in tissues by an immunochemical method, using monoclonal antibodies. PAI-1 occurred throughout the body; its concentration and activity differed considerably from organ to organ. Extracts of liver and spleen had the greatest abundance of PAI-1, but the activity of the inhibitor was much higher in liver than in spleen: the liver may be a source of plasma PAI-1. Immunochemical staining for PAI-1 was observed in endothelium, platelets and their precursor cells, the megakaryocytes, and locations central to the process of haemostasis. PAI-1 also occurred in neutrophil polymorphs and macrophages, cells important in inflammatory and immune processes, but not in lymphocytes. Other cell types, in particular, vascular smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells, also stained positively for PAI-1 and such cells seem to represent an important reservoir of PAI-1.\r"

Amylase was expressed in 21 of 24 (88%) thyroid cancers by polyclonal antiserum analysis. Analysis by monoclonal antibodies, however, showed that only 13 (54%) cases and three (13%) cases contained salivary-type and pancreatic-type amylases, respectively. Moreover, immunoreactivity for pancreatic-type amylase was detected only in medullary carcinoma; other histological types were positive for salivary-type amylase. These results show that thyroid cancer frequently expresses amylase, and suggest that the differences between amylase isoenzymes in thyroid cancer may correlate with those found between cellular origin of tumour.\r"

Some of the limitations and problems associated with image analysis which came to light included an unacceptably high coefficient of variation (CV) and a \"left-shift\" in the DI in most DNA histograms obtained when using image analysis of 5 microns sections. In contrast, the DNA histograms generated using image analysis of cytospun nuclei from paraffin wax blocks were of good quality and similar to those obtained using flow cytometry. Variability in Feulgen staining was common and an important source of error despite rigorous control of the staining technique. This could be overcome by using internal controls such as fibroblasts rather than external controls (rat hepatocytes) to determine the diploid DI with image analysis. A thorough understanding and appreciation of the methodological problems associated with image analysis and flow cytometric determination of DNA content is required before these methods find widespread clinical application.\r"

The organism rapidly dies in vitro in the presence of urea at pH 6. When incubated in citrate buffer (pH 6) plus urea (10 mM) the five minute survival was 26% compared with 96% without urea and the survival progressively decreased with increasing urea concentrations, being only 9% in 50 mM urea. The bactericidal effect depended on pH as the organism survived in citrate buffer (pH 7) plus urea (50 mM). The death of the organism at pH 6 in the presence of urea was prevented by the addition of the competitive urease inhibitor hydroxyurea. These findings indicate that destruction of the organism is mediated by its exceptionally high urease activity. Harnessing this enzyme to induce self-destruction could provide a new approach to eradicating this common infection.\r"

One hundred and fifty one Streptococcus spp were received from 78 United Kingdom laboratories in one year. Strains were identified using the API 20 Strep, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of penicillin were determined using the spiral gradient plate method. Penicillin tolerance was detected by spraying beta-lactamase over inoculated gradient plates, reincubating for 48 hours and counting the number of surviving organisms represented by colonies. There were 57 different API identification profiles encountered in the survey. Most S sanguis I/1 strains were penicillin tolerant, most S sanguis II strains were non-tolerant. The overall geometric mean MIC of penicillin was considerably lower for S sanguis I/1 than for all other biotypes. The distribution of biotypes and the geometric mean MIC of penicillin for each biotype were not significantly different for infective endocarditis strains than for all strains tested, suggesting little or no association between penicillin tolerance and the seeding of endocardium. When the reactions obtained using API 20 Strep were compared with a recent taxonomic study of viridans streptococci, 22 of 38 S sanguis I/1 strains could be reclassified as S gordonii; all these strains were penicillin tolerant. Such reclassification would allow likely penicillin tolerant strains to be predicted.\r"

Absolute discrimination of HPV types, therefore, was not possible with the monoclonal antibodies used in this study. The relative sensitivities of these antibodies were also lower than NISH. Sequential immunocytochemistry and NISH on the same section showed that 2.9-13.0 times as many cells were positive by NISH than by immunocytochemistry using the most sensitive monoclonal antibody.

HbA1c decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.2% (mean value +/- SEM) to 7.2 +/- 0.1% in the ICT group, and from 9.4 +/- 0.2% to 8.7 +/- 0.1% in the RT group (difference between the groups, P less than 0.001). Retinopathy increased in both groups (P less than 0.001), but after 5 years it was worse in the RT group (P less than 0.05). The urinary albumin excretion rate was higher in the RT group than in the ICT group after 5 years (239.9 +/- 129.7 micrograms min-1 vs. 46.0 +/- 26.1 micrograms min-1, P less than 0.05). Eight RT patients developed manifest nephropathy, compared with none in the ICT group (P less than 0.01). After 5 years the conduction velocities of the sural (P less than 0.05), peroneal (P less than 0.01) and tibial (P less than 0.001) nerves were lower in the RT group. The respiratory sinus arrhythmia was 12.1 +/- 1.2 beats min-1 in the RT group and 16.7 +/- 1.4 beats min-1 in the ICT group at the end of the study (P less than 0.01). The increases in retinopathy (P less than 0.01), nephropathy (P less than 0.01) and neuropathy (P less than 0.001) were all related to the mean HbA1c value during the study. Smoking habits only influenced the progression of retinopathy (P less than 0.05). Serious hypoglycaemia occurred in 34 ICT patients and 29 RT patients (242 and 98 episodes, respectively) (P less than 0.05). Whereas weight was stable in the RT group, the body mass index increased by 5.8% in the ICT group (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, microvascular complications of diabetes were retarded by intensified conventional insulin treatment. However, such treatment increased the frequency of serious hypoglycaemia, and led to an increase in body weight.\r"

Of the total patient sample, 3954 subjects were non beta-thalasaemics (NBTs), and 447 subjects were heterozygous beta-thalassaemics (HBTs). AMI was diagnosed in 384 patients, of whom 17 individuals were HBTs and 367 subjects were NBTs. The prevalence of HBTs in this group was significantly lower than expected (4.43%, P less than 0.0001). Furthermore, an analysis by sex showed that this lower prevalence could be attributed to male patients. Moreover, only in male subjects was a significant negative correlation observed between AMI and HBT. The mean age at which AMI occurred in male HBTs was significantly higher than in male NBTs (72 +/- 2.69 vs. 63 +/- 0.7 years, P less than 0.05), while no differences were found in the mean age at which AMI occurred between HBT and NBT female subjects. This study demonstrates that the thalassaemic trait may afford some protection against the occurrence of AMI in men.\r"

Sinemet CR4 offers a theoretically attractive method of achieving gradual sustained release of levodopa over time which may be more physiological to striatal dopamine receptors in the early stages of the disease. This study evaluated 20 patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease who were treated with Sinemet CR4 over a 1-year period. Eleven patients completed the full year on therapy, and nine subjects withdrew. Of the withdrawals, two subjects died from non-Parkinson's disease-related illness, three showed no therapeutic benefit, and four responded well for a minimal 6-month period, but then lost therapeutic benefit and developed more severe dystonias. A higher overall levodopa dosage was required by all patients, and side-effects of levodopa were still present in most patients. However, the nocturnal benefit of this long-acting preparation was observed by all the patients in the study. Slow onset of action of Sinemet CR4 resulted in early-morning immobility. Sinemet CR4 cannot replace standard Sinemet, but appears to be a useful form of adjunct therapy in selected patients.\r"

Those two groups did not differ from the biopsy-verified group with respect to SMR, sex distribution or age. In the group of patients with department-diagnosed GCA (definite + probable = 180 patients), the 95% confidence interval for the SMR of the women included 1.0. In all other subgroups there was a significant excess mortality. Excess mortality has been found in two of seven previous studies on survival in GCA.

Arterial hypertension was associated with OSAS, but not with smoking or the degree of obesity. Antihypertensive treatment was received by nine of the 27 patients; six of them had OSAS. Thus six of the 11 (54.5%) patients with OSAS and three of the 16 (18.8%) nonapnoeic patients were treated for arterial hypertension (Fisher exact test, P = 0.042). The odds ratio of OSAS for arterial hypertension is 5.2 (95% CI, 0.71-43.6). Vertical-banded gastroplasty was performed in 14 patients, three of whom had OSAS. The selection of patients for gastroplasty was made without taking into account the results of sleep recordings. In the three OSAS patients, a 30-38% reduction in BMI was achieved by surgery. Eight patients with OSAS were treated with an intensified dietary regimen, and the reduction in BMI ranged from -2.6 to 33%. OSAS was either cured or significantly improved in six (55%) patients, with a mean reduction in BMI of 27%, while in patients with persistent OSAS the mean reduction in BMI was only 7%.\r"

A sample of 96 lean NIDDM patients (body mass index less than 25 kg m-2 in men and less than 27 kg m-2 in women) were divided into two groups: group I, where the HbA1c concentration had been less than 6% for the previous 3 months, and group II, where the HbA1c concentration had been greater than 8% for the previous 3 months. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol levels showed no significant differences between groups I and II. Furthermore, serum levels of apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, CII, CIII, and E did not differ significantly between groups I and II. These results suggest that glycaemic control did not influence lipid metabolism in lean NIDDM patients.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 34 severely obese men with a history of heavy snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness indicative of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) were studied prospectively. Their mean age was 46 years, and mean body mass index was 41.6 kg m-2. During a 4-year follow-up, 15% (5/34) of these subjects died (three cases of acute myocardial infarction and two cases of pulmonary oedema), all of them suddenly and unexpectedly, outside hospital. On autopsy the degree of atherosclerosis was found to be moderate in all cases. In 68% (15/22) of the men a pathological apnoea index (mean value 46 +/- 20) confirmed the OSAS diagnosis. Exercise tests and neurological examinations did not reveal any other causes of daytime sleepiness. Mean blood pressure at rest and during exercise was normal, and mean serum lipid and blood glucose levels were normal. Spirometry revealed intrapulmonary restrictive changes that could not be attributed to the heavy thoracic wall. Compliance was reduced to about 50% of reference values, and the mean pCO2 level (5.8 kPa) was close to the upper reference limit. Blood tests suggested that high alcohol consumption may be an important factor contributing to OSAS. These results demonstrate that morbidly obese men with a history of OSAS have a high risk of sudden cardiovascular death, despite the absence of other conventional risk factors.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this long-term ECG (LTER) study in 394 68-year-old men, selected at random from the general population of Malmo, Sweden, was to determine the prevalence and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and their impact on morbidity and mortality from IHD. According to Lown classification, 29.4% (116 men) had ventricular arrhythmia (VA) group 4-5. Serious ventricular arrhythmia (Lown group 4-5) was more common in men with asymptomatic ischaemic type ST-segment depression (STD) than in those without it (37.8% vs. 26.7%: P less than 0.05). During the mean follow-up period of 53.1 months there were seven IHD deaths (6%) among the 116 patients with VA, Lown 4-5, and nine IHD deaths (3.2%) among the 278 patients without serious VA, Lown 0-3, (P = 0.26). Six and three of these deaths, respectively, were considered to be sudden (P = 0.022). The increased cardiac event rate (fatal or non-fatal MI or deaths due to chronic IHD) associated with a serious ventricular arrhythmia disappeared when history of IHD at baseline and occurrence of STD during LTER were taken into account. The study did not provide any evidence to suggest that ventricular arrhythmia was triggered by myocardial ischaemia. Five of 9 (56%) deaths due to IHD in men with STD occurred among the 38% (37/98) of patients who belonged to Lown class 4-5. It is concluded that the prognostic information derived from LTER can be improved by combined monitoring of STD and ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Simvastatin had a persistent hypolipidaemic effect; the mean reduction in serum cholesterol was 36-51%, and the mean reduction in serum triglycerides was 32-55%. The decrease in serum lipids was caused by a decline in VLDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels; the mean ratio between VLDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides decreased significantly from 1.06 to 0.73. There was no significant difference between the once-a-day and twice-a-day regimens. Simvastatin was well tolerated; no serious side-effects were observed.

The design consisted of a prospective, before-after trial: the same consecutive patients were studied before and after intervention with observation periods 1 year before and 1 year after intervention. The investigation took place within a tertiary care centre (university hospital). A total of 142 consecutive patients were referred for in-patient treatment of their asthma, of whom 132 (93%) patients participated in the follow-up examination. The intervention consisted of a structured 5-d in-patient treatment and teaching programme presented by a specialized nurse educator. The aim of the programme was for the patient to assume greater responsibility for disease management, including self-monitoring of peak expiratory flow and qualified self-adaptation of drug therapy. The main outcome measures were the frequency of severe asthma attacks, hospitalization, and absenteeism from work (data provided by health insurance companies), patients' compliance and management skills. During the year before and the year after the intervention 71% and 36%, respectively of patients had one or more severe asthma attacks (mean difference 35%, 95% CI: 25-45%, P less than 0.0001). The percentage of patients who were hospitalized because of asthma decreased from 39% to 22% (mean difference 17%, 95% CI: 7-27%, P less than 0.002). The percentage of employed patients (n = 67) who were absent from work because of asthma decreased from 60% to 43% (mean difference 17%, 95% CI: 4-30%, P less than 0.04). The patients' adherence to maintenance drug therapy and their management skills improved significantly. It was concluded that the participation of patients with moderate to severe asthma in a structured treatment and teaching programme resulted in a substantial reduction in asthma morbidity in the year following the intervention.\r"

Fifty-three of the 73 undiagnosed patients appeared to be completely without signs of cirrhosis (silent cirrhosis). In the diagnosed group, 70% of patients died from hepatic causes, in contrast to 16% in the undiagnosed group. At autopsy, the following complications of cirrhosis were found more frequently in the diagnosed group than in the undiagnosed group: ascites (41% vs. 8%), oesophageal varices (44% vs. 10%), splenomegaly (52% vs. 29%). The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ significantly in the two groups (12% vs. 8%).

He experienced severe AmpB-related side-effects, and was subsequently successfully treated with a pharmaceutical preparation of AmpB (5.7 g) entrapped in sonicated liposomes, composed of lecithin, cholesterol and stearylamine in a molar ratio of 4:3:1. Three months later, during maintenance chemotherapy, liposomal AmpB (5.1 g) was reinstituted due to the finding of biopsies positive for Candida albicans at bronchoscopy. After healing of the patient's fungal infection a left upper lobe resection was performed, which showed advanced fibrosis with signs of inflammation, but no evidence of fungal disease. Since no acute side-effects and only moderate hypokalaemia were observed, it appears that liposomal AmpB is superior to conventional AmpB treatment in granulocytopenic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis and unbearable therapy-related side-effects.\r"

In an attempt to quantitate and explain this situation, the acute motor responses to intravenous injections of the dopamine agonist, (-)-N-n-propyl-norapomorphine hydrochloride (NPA), were compared with those of the dopamine precursor, levodopa. At optimum dose levels, the acute anti-Parkinsonian efficacy of NPA averaged only about 50% of maximum, while essentially total symptom suppression was obtained with levodopa in patients previously treated with the amine precursor. Dyskinesia severity, however, was similar with the two drugs. These differences in anti-Parkinsonian efficacy may reflect the fact that while NPA acts mainly on D-2 dopamine receptors, levodopa results in stimulation of both the D-1 and D-2 subsets of receptors at a more physiological ratio. Future efforts to develop dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms may thus have to consider focusing on drugs having pharmacological profile more similar to that of dopamine.\r"

The occurrence of stable remission (SR) (that is, complete clinical drug-free remission that remains stable for all the subsequent follow up) was the endpoint of survival analyses and the distribution of SR time (SRT, that is, the interval from thymectomy to the occurrence of SR) was assessed by actuarial and Cox multivariate analyses. SRT distribution after surgery showed a slow progressive increase of cumulative SR rate that could both be ascribed to a delayed effect of thymectomy as well as reflect the natural history of MG, itself characterised by an increasing probability of spontaneous remission with time. SRT distribution was similar after stratification for all variables studied except when patients without thymoma were stratified for the need for immunosuppressive treatment in addition to thymectomy. Patients without thymoma who did not require additional immunosuppressive therapy (n = 130) had the highest SR rate occurring in the two years after thymectomy, and differed from patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs who showed the highest SR rate five years after surgery. Actuarial analysis has therefore identified a subgroup of patients where SR, occurring in the first years after surgery, is more likely to be ascribed to thymectomy than merely reflect the natural course of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by intrathecal synthesis of IgG, less frequently of IgA and IgM. Local production of antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP) and other myelin components has also been reported, and autoimmune pathogenesis has been postulated. Whether MS is accompanied by a systemic B cell response is less clear. To elucidate this question, we examined bone marrow and peripheral blood from patients with MS and controls for cells secreting IgG, IgA and IgM, as well as anti-MBP antibodies of these three isotypes. Patients with MS without any signs of concurrent infections had higher numbers of IgG + IgA + IgM secreting cells both in bone marrow and peripheral blood compared with healthy controls. The same abnormalities were observed in patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND). When analysing individual isotypes, patients with MS and OIND had higher numbers of IgA secreting cells both in bone marrow and blood compared with healthy controls. Only one of 13 MS patients examined had anti-MBP antibody secreting cells in bone marrow and blood. The systemic B cell response registered in MS is also present in other inflammatory neurological diseases and its specificity and possible role in the pathogenesis of MS remains unknown.\r"

Twenty seven (60%) experienced benign vascular sexual headache alone and eighteen (40%) had experienced both benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache on at least one occasion. The mean age was 34.3 years with a male:female ratio of 5.4:1. Thirty patients with a history of benign vascular sexual headache were followed for an average of 74 months. A personal history of migraine was found in 47% of cases and a family history of migraine in 30%. Forty one per cent of patients with benign vascular sexual headache alone had recurrences after diagnosis, and stress and fatigue were considered major contributing factors to the initial and recurrent headache. Nine patients had experienced benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache within 72 hours of each other on at least one occasion, often with a residual headache between the two. Four patients experienced their benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache separated by months to years. The prognosis of benign vascular sexual headache and the clinical and possible pathophysiological relationships between benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache are discussed. Knowledge of the interrelationships of these varieties of headache is valuable in the counselling of patients.\r"

  ".W": "We report a series of 14 cases of psychosis occurring in patients with severe intractable epilepsy, following the prescription of vigabatrin, a new antiepileptic drug. Nine patients had no previous history of psychosis. In eight patients the psychosis occurred following a change in the habitual pattern of seizure activity; in four it developed after a period of seizure freedom followed by a cluster of seizures, and in the other four patients an alternating psychosis was observed. In five patients there was no clear relationship to seizure pattern. Another patient developed psychosis after taking an overdose of between eight and 12 g of vigabatrin. A further three patients, who developed psychosis following vigabatrin withdrawal, were not included in this series. The mean dose at onset of the psychosis (excluding the patient who took an overdose) was 2580 mg, and the period from initiation of therapy to the onset of psychosis varied from five days to 32 weeks (and occurred 24 hours after the overdose of vigabatrin). In all cases the psychosis resolved, but necessitated the withdrawal of vigabatrin, except in the single patient who took the overdose. The mechanism of this behaviour change is unclear, but in some instances may reflect vigabatrin's powerful anti-epileptic action. This is clearly not the case for all patients. Vigabatrin should be started with caution in patients with severe epilepsy, particularly in the presence of a previous history of psychosis, and such patients should be carefully monitored.\r"

The low intracranial pressure is secondary to net loss of intracranial CSF. It has, however, not been possible to measure intracranial CSF volume accurately during life until recently. Intracranial CSF volume can now be measured non-invasively by a MRI technique. The changes in intracranial CSF volume were studied in 20 patients who had LP. Total intracranial CSF volume was reduced in 19 of the 20 patients 24 hours after LP (range -1.8 mls to -158.6 mls). Most of the CSF was lost from the cortical sulci. Very large reductions in intracranial CSF volume were frequently related to post-LP headache but some patients developed headache with relatively little alteration in the intracranial CSF volume. There was not a measurable change in position of the intracranial structures following LP.\r"

Initial clinical features included letter-by-letter alexia, visual anomia, acalculia, mild agraphia, constructional apraxia, and visuospatial compromise. Serial testing demonstrated relentless deterioration with additional development of transcortical sensory aphasia, Gerstmann's tetrad, and severe visuoperceptual impairment. Amnesia was not an early clinical feature. Judgment, personality, insight, and awareness remained preserved throughout most of the clinical course. Extinction in the right visual field to bilateral stimulation was the sole neurological abnormality. Early CT was normal and late MRI showed asymmetrical bioccipitoparietal atrophy with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. Results from positron emission tomography (PET) showed bilaterally asymmetric (left greater than right) occipitotemporoparietal hypometabolism. The metabolic decrement was strikingly asymmetric with a 50% reduction in glucose consumption confined to the left occipital cortex. The picture of occipitotemporoparietal compromise verified by MRI, PET, and neurobehavioural testing would be unusual for such degenerative dementias as Alzheimer's (AD) and Pick's disease, although atypical AD with predominant occipital lobe involvement cannot be excluded. This case supports the concepts of posterior cortical dementia (PCD) as a clinically distinct entity and for the first time documents its corresponding metabolic deficit using PET.\r"

The removal of creatine phosphate (CP) greatly affected the Ca++ sensitivity and induced a leftward shift of the pCa++ tension curve. Addition of ADP beta S (10-300 microM) also caused a leftward shift of the pCa++ tension curve. Ca++ solutions (0.3-10 microM) containing 0.1 mM ATP did not induce contraction. However, the addition of CP in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP dose-dependently increased force development which reached a maximum around 3 mM CP. A 10 microM Ca++ solution containing 0.1 mM ATP and 1 mM CP was much more effective in inducing contraction than a 10 microM Ca++ solution containing 1.1 mM ATP alone, although the total concentration of phosphagen (ATP + CP) was the same. Application of 0.1 mM ATP solution containing various concentrations of Ca++ after the maximal Ca+(+)-induced contraction relaxed the tissue, with the higher Ca++ concentrations inducing the faster relaxation. The same pattern of the relaxation was seen when the tissue was pretreated with adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) beforehand. The contractile state observed in the Ca+(+)-free solution containing 0.1 mM ATP and 0.1 mM CP was completely relaxed by 1 mM vanadate, consistent with the idea that the sustained contraction was due to accumulation of the actomyosin-ADP complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is considered to play a primary role in normal mnemonic functioning. Although most research has centered on the central muscarinic cholinergic system, of recent interest in normal and pathologic cognitive processing is the role of the nicotinic cholinergic system. The purpose of this research was to further characterize the role of the nicotinic system in learning and memory processing in a classical passive avoidance task by rats. The centrally acting nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine produced a dose-dependent impairment of performance in the passive avoidance task, however, the peripherally acting nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium was ineffective in this test. To elucidate the potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying mecamylamine's amnestic effect, we examined the ability of the drug to alter specific dynamic components of rat brain cholinergic systems in five brain regions. Mecamylamine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the synthesis of [3H]ACh from pulse-injected [3H]choline in all regions examined, but was without effect on endogenous, steady-state levels of ACh. As with the behavioral study, administration of hexamethonium was without effect on [3H]ACh synthesis. Calculation of the turnover rates of ACh allowed a correlation between the inhibition of the behavioral task and the inhibition of central cholinergic function. The high degree of correlation obtained (as well as earlier studies in nonhuman primates) underlined the possibility that presynaptically located nicotinic receptors on brain cholinergic neurons are tonically active and mediate a positive feedback mechanism for controlling cholinergic neuronal activity. These receptors may be the neurochemical substrate which underlie the behavioral changes after administration of nicotinic agonists and antagonists.\r"

Electrophysiologic testing was performed on conscious male mongrel dogs (14.5-21.5 kg) 3 to 5 days after surgical induction of an anterior myocardial infarction by occlusion (2 h)-reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared to saline-treated control animals, UK-68,798 at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg i.v. did not (P = .083) suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation. Six of 12 UK-68,798-treated dogs remained inducible, whereas 10 of 12 vehicle-treated dogs responded to electrical induction of arrhythmia. When compared to predrug inducibility, UK-68,798 significantly (P = .007) reduced the incidence of programmed electrical stimulation-induced ventricular tachycardia. In five of the six dogs inducible after UK-68,798 administration, the cycle length of the induced ventricular tachycardia was prolonged (P = .007) compared to the predrug cycle length. Heart rate, PR interval and QRS duration were not affected by UK-68,798 administration. The rate-corrected QT interval was prolonged (P less than .05) by UK-68,798. The ventricular effective refractory period was increased by UK-68,798 (158 +/- 7 msec, predrug vs. 185 +/- 7 msec, postdrug). Subsequent to programmed electrical stimulation, a 150 microA anodal current was applied to the luminal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery to induce transient episodes of posterolateral ischemia in response to electrolytic injury of the vessel wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies by our laboratory have indicated that inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs) express a novel dopamine (DA) receptor, designated DA2K, that is linked to stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production. This receptor has a distinct pharmacological profile and is similar in size, but not homologous to, the brain D2 receptor. Because the DA2-selective antagonist domperidone blocks DA-mediated stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production in IMCD cells, we utilized [3H]domperidone to study the binding characteristics of the DA2K receptor in IMCD cells. [3H]Domperidone binding was saturable and best fit to a single high density site (KD, 57.6 +/- 10.5 nM; Bmax, 14.9 +/- 2.7 pmol/mg protein). The specificity of [3H]domperidone binding in IMCD cells was verified by competition analysis with a variety of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic agents. Dopaminergic drugs were less potent competitors for [3H]domperidone binding in IMCD cells than previously reported for brain DA receptors, but the rank order was consistent with the labeling of a DA receptor [antagonists: domperidone greater than spiperone greater than haloperidol greater than Sch 23390 much greater than (-)-sulpiride; agonists: norapomorphine greater than fenoldopam much greater than dopamine = quinpirole], and was better correlated with the pharmacological profile for the brain D2 receptor than the brain D3 receptor. In addition, quinpirole, the most D3-selective ligand currently available, did not compete for [3H]domperidone binding in IMCD cells. These results add further support to the existence of a novel high density DA receptor, DA2K, expressed in IMCD cells.\r"

  ".W": "The smooth muscle of guinea pig uterus is contracted by adenosine in a manner consistent with the presence of a purine nucleoside receptor of the P1-A1 subtype that is uncoupled from adenylate cyclase. Here we investigate the signal transduction mechanism responsible for adenosine's ability to contract uterine smooth muscle. The A1 adenosine receptor antagonist [3H]-8-cyclopentyl-1.3- dipropyl xanthine ([3H]CPX) bound reversibly to a large number (172 +/- 25 fmol/mg of protein) of receptors in myometrial smooth muscle membranes from estrogen-primed virgin guinea pigs with an affinity (KD = 1.77 +/- 0.21 nM) similar to that expected of [3H]CPX binding to both central and peripheral A1 receptors. In the absence of the stable GTP analog, guanosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate], agonist competition of [3H]CPX binding resulted in a biphasic curve that was best fit assuming the presence of equal populations of two affinity states of the receptor. Addition of guanosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate] (10 microM) resulted in a monophasic competition curve of low affinity suggesting coupling of this A1 receptor to effector via a GTP binding protein. In [3H]myo-inositol labeled strips of myometrial smooth muscle, the adenosine agonist R-phenylisopropyl adenosine (R-PIA) stimulated the rapid formation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) that was antagonized by addition of the nucleoside receptor antagonist 8-sulfophenyl theophylline. Prostaglandin stimulation of myometrial strips also increased InsP3 formation. Furthermore, R-PIA stimulated the disappearance of inositol phosphate (InsP) in a fashion consistent with agonist stimulation of an inositol phosphatase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

EEDQ alone results in an acute mild hyperalgesic effect. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine, clonidine and ST-91 result in a dose-dependent increase in the hot plate response latency: ED50 (95% confidence interval) = 13 (2.1-73), 120 (52-310) and 21 (1.3-240) nmol, respectively. Pretreatment with intrathecal EEDQ (8.1-810 nmol) caused a rightward shift of dose-response curve and reduction of maximal effect of alpha-2 agonists used. For example, 24 hr after 81 nmol of EEDQ, the degree of the rightward shift and the depression of slope was ST-91 greater than clonidine greater than dexmedetomidine. Analysis of the double reciprocal plot indicated that at the ED50, intrathecal dexmedetomidine, clonidine and ST-91 required an apparent occupancy of 10, 36 and 30%, respectively. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine has a higher intrinsic efficacy than clonidine or ST-91.\r"

  ".W": "Pigment aggregation in melanophores from the cuckoo wrasse (Labrus ossifagus L.) has previously been shown to be mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In the present investigation, the effect of amiloride on pigment aggregation induced by noradrenaline and B-HT 920 was studied. Amiloride caused a parallel shift to the right in concentration-response curves for 5-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrothiazolo-[4,5-d]azepine-dihyd roc hloride: (B-HT 920), with no change in the maximal response, indicating simple competitive inhibition. Subsequent Schild plot analysis gave a straight line with a slope of almost unity (0.95) and a KB of 5 x 10(-6) M. In contrast to the effect of amiloride on B-HT 920-induced pigment aggregation, only a very high concentration of amiloride (1 x 10(3) M) inhibited the corresponding effect of noradrenaline. Na+/H+ exchange has been suggested as a possible mechanism for alpha-2 adrenoceptors, and the amiloride analogs 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride are known to be more specific than amiloride itself in this respect. However, these analogs inhibited the effect of B-HT 920 significantly less effectively than amiloride. Furthermore, manipulating the extracellular pH between 6.8 and 7.8 did not affect the concentration response curves of B-HT 920. Neither did the prostanoid pathway inhibitors, quinacrine or indomethacin, inhibit the pigment-aggregating effect of B-HT 920. The present results suggest that amiloride competes with B-HT 920 as receptor antagonist, and that Na+/H+ exchange is insignificant for the alpha-2 adrenoceptor-stimulated pigment aggregation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the first screening in the presence of cocaine and 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015), a L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, L-dopa (1-100 nM) concentration-dependently facilitated NE release. L-dopa (1 microM) reduced NE release. D-dopa, L-phenylalanine, 3-O-methyl-dopa, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or L-dopa-phosphate at 1 to 1000 nM, and carbidopa (1-10 nM), did not mimic L-dopa. L-dopa methyl ester (0.3-10 nM) concentration-dependently decreased NE release, suggesting that it is antagonistic, whereas L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (0.001-1 nM) concentration-dependently mimicked L-dopa. At the second screening in the additional presence of S-sulpiride, L-dopa (1-1000 nM) concentration-dependently facilitated NE release. Maximum effect was seen at 0.3 to 1 microM. Pretreatment with carbidopa (0.1-10 nM) or L-dopa phosphate (0.01-0.1 nM) was somewhat antagonistic. L-Dopa methyl ester (3-30 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner shifted the concentration-facilitation curve for L-dopa to the right: Schild plots gave a straight line with a slope of 1.00 and pA2 was 8.9, whereas l-propranolol (1-100 nM) concentration-dependently reduced maximal effect of L-dopa without rightward shift of the curve.

Any improvement of our understanding of the mechanisms through which these seizures are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs is therefore of considerable importance. By examining the effects of the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin in a large group of kindled rats, a widely used model of complex partial seizures, animals with different sensitivity to this drug were selected. Using determination of the focal seizure threshold for evaluation of phenytoin's anticonvulsant effect, most animals (about 60%) showed variable effects in response to phenytoin. However, about 20% of the animals (\"phenytoin nonresponders\") showed no increase in their focal seizure threshold at repeated test trials with phenytoin, and 20% (\"phenytoin responders\") exhibited reproducible increases in focal seizure threshold after injection of phenytoin. Phenytoin responders and nonresponders thus selected were used for subsequent experiments. The different response of focal seizures to phenytoin was not related to differences in pharmacokinetics or location of the stimulating electrode. Although phenytoin reproducibly increased the threshold for induction of afterdischarges in responders, it did not alter severity or duration of the elicited seizure response. In contrast to phenytoin, carbamazepine induced increases in focal seizure threshold in all kindled rats. Duration of seizures and afterdischarges were significantly reduced by carbamazepine in phenytoin responders, but not in nonresponders, although plasma levels of carbamazepine were the same in both groups. The difference in response of kindled rats to phenytoin was restricted to kindled seizures, because phenytoin induced the same anticonvulsant effect on the threshold for generalized tonic electroconvulsions (determined via transauricular electrodes) in both groups of kindled rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adenosine, 2-[p-(carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N- ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680), 2-chloroadenosine (CADO), 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), R(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and 1-deaza-2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (DCCPA) were applied by adding them to the superfusion solution. Adenosine (30 nM to 30 microM) depolarized S-type neurons neurons and this was mimicked by analogs with potency order: CGS21680 = NECA greater than R-PIA greater than CADO greater than adenosine greater than CHA much greater than DCCPA. 8-Cyclopentyltheophylline (CPT) blocked the depolarizing action of CADO or R-PIA; this antagonism was surmountable and the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) estimated by the Schild method was 295 nM. Synaptic potentials were evoked by focal stimulation of nerve strands running between submucosal ganglia. The nicotinic excitatory postsynaptic potential was reduced by adenosine and analogs with potency order CHA = R-PIA greater than DCCPA = NECA = CADO greater than adenosine much greater than CGS21680; CPT competitively antagonized this effect of CADO or CHA with a KD of 13 nM. The noradrenergic inhibitory postsynaptic potential was also reduced; the potency order was R-PIA greater than CHA = CADO = NECA = DCCPA greater than adenosine much greater than CGS21680; the KD of CPT as an antagonist was 7 nM. It is concluded that adenosine directly depolarizes submucosal neurons by acting at an A2 receptor, and that it inhibits the release of acetylcholine (from intramural nerves) and noradrenaline (from sympathetic nerves) by acting at a presynaptic A1 receptor.\r"

Neostriatal slices from Fischer 344 rats aged 3, 10 and 28 months were prepared and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer oxygenated with 95% O2/5% CO2. Acetylcholine release from slices of each age group was monitored in the presence or absence of muscarinic agents, and the release in the presence of the drug was compared to the release from slices of age-matched controls in the absence of drug. The muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, and two muscarinic antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, were tested for their effects on acetylcholine release. Pirenzepine is selective in its interaction with the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype; atropine and oxotremorine are nonselective in their actions. Of the three drugs tested, pirenzepine displayed a significant age-related difference in its effects on acetylcholine release. Whereas the effects of pirenzepine (50 microM) on acetylcholine release modulation in slices from the 3-month rats were negligible, the M1-selective antagonist increased the release of acetylcholine from slices of 10- and 28-month rats by another 42 and 192% (P less than .05), respectively. Atropine (1 microM) was also tested, and an increase in acetylcholine release by another 64, 104 and 218% (all P less than .05) was observed in slices from the 3-, 10- and 28-month rats, respectively. In the presence of oxotremorine (50 microM), acetylcholine release decreased in slices from the 3-month rats by 35% (P less than .1), but changed by only 7 and 15% in the 10- and 28-month slices, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In binding to opioid receptors in monkey brain membranes, mirfentanil was much more selective for mu sites (7.99 nM) than for either kappa (1428 nM) or delta (480 nM) sites as measured by displacement of [3H]DAMGO. [3H]U-69.593 or [3H]DPDPE, respectively. In morphine-treated pigeons discriminating among naltrexone, saline and morphine, mirfentanil failed to substitute for either training drug; in morphine-abstinent pigeons, mirfentanil reversed responding on the naltrexone key (i.e., reversed withdrawal). In morphine-treated monkeys discriminating between saline and naltrexone, mirfentanil substituted completely for naltrexone, and this effect was attenuated by an acute injection of morphine; mirfentanil also attenuated the withdrawal-reversing effects of alfentanil in morphine-abstinent monkeys. Administered i.v., mirfentanil maintained rates of self-administration responding only slightly below rates maintained by alfentanil, and this effect of mirfentanil was antagonized by quadazocine. Small doses of mirfentanil (0.032-0.32 mg/kg) antagonized the analgesic effects of alfentanil; larger doses of mirfentanil both antagonized the analgesic effects of alfentanil and produced analgesic effects when administered alone. The analgesic effects of mirfentanil were not attenuated by large doses of opioid antagonists. Mirfentanil had modest respiratory depressant effects that were not altered by quadazocine; however, mirfentanil antagonized the respiratory depressant effects of large doses of alfentanil. Both in vivo and in vitro, mirfentanil appears to have selectivity for opioid mu receptors. Moreover, at doses larger than those which exert opioid effects, mirfentanil has nonopioid analgesic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The analgesic and hyperthermic responses were determined before and at 30-min intervals for a period of 360 min after the morphine injection and were expressed as area under the time-response curve. Blood samples were collected periodically for a period of 24 h. Serum was separated and was used for the estimation of morphine by the highly sensitive radioimmunoassay. The pharmacokinetic parameters, half life, the terminal elimination rate constant, the mean residence time, the apparent volume of distribution at steady state and the total clearance were determined by using noncompartmental analysis. The area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity was related to the dose of morphine. The other parameters were the same for all the doses of morphine, except the serum levels of morphine extrapolated to zero time which increase gradually with the dose. Dose-dependent analgesic and hyperthermic responses were related to the area under the serum concentration-time curve. It is concluded that the dose-dependent pharmacological effects of morphine were related to the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity for serum levels of morphine but not to the other pharmacokinetic parameters.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cannabinoids produce antinociception spinal and supraspinal sites of action. The antinociceptive effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (3 or 10 mg/kg), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, and CP-55,940 (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg), a potent synthetic cannabinoid, were assessed in spinally transected and intact rats. Each drug, administered i.v., produced a potent, long-lasting elevation of tail-flick latencies in the intact animals. This antinociception was significantly attenuated by spinal transection. Administration of each cannabinoid (i.t.) to the lumbar region of the spinal cord produced a weak, but long-enduring antinociceptive effect. In contrast, spinal administration of CP-55,940 to the upper thoracic region failed to elevate tail-flick latencies above base-line values. Additionally, i.t. administration of CP-55,940 (30 or 100 micrograms) continued to have a weak antinociceptive effect in spinal rats. In contrast, i.t. administration of CP-56,667, the (+)-enantiomer of CP-55,940, failed to elevate tail-flick latencies above base line at a dose of 1000 micrograms, thus indicating stereoselectivity. Finally, the biodisposition of 3H-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol after either i.v. or i.t. administration to spinal and intact rats was also assessed. The levels of radioactivity did not differ between spinal and intact animals in either whole brain, spinal cord, or plasma when the drug was administered i.v. When the drug was administered i.t., however, surgical transection of the spinal cord led to a decreased concentration of labeled substances in the whole brain and plasma. These converging lines of evidence indicate that cannabinoids produce antinociception through multiple mechanisms at the spinal and supraspinal levels of the central nervous system.\r"

ET-1 produced biphasic increases in Ca++i consisting of a transient peak elevation followed by a sustained plateau phase. Both peak and plateau Ca++i responses to 5 nM ET-1 were reduced by depletion of extracellular Ca++. Peak responses were also attenuated by inhibitors of inositol phosphate metabolism, whereas plateau responses were affected by dihydropyridine Ca++ channel agonists and antagonists and by differentiation. These results suggest that peak Ca++i responses to ET-1 involve mobilization of Ca++ from inositol phosphate-sensitive intracellular stores and influx of extracellular Ca++ through nonclassical Ca++ channels, whereas plateau responses are mediated by Ca++ influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-gated channels.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacological analysis of the effects of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonists on contraction of guinea pig airway smooth muscle to leukotrienes reveals the presence of two subtypes of the LTD4 receptor. This finding is, however, inconsistent with [3H]LTD4 equilibrium binding results, which show no evidence of a heterogeneity of pulmonary [3H]LTD4 binding sites. It is possible that LTD4 binds to the two receptor subsets with equal affinity, and the pharmacological difference between them lies in the relative ability of leukotriene (LT) agonists and antagonists to interact at the receptor sites. This study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the rank order of potency of LTs and ICI-198,615 in competing with [3H]LTD4 for their respective binding sites in guinea pig lung membranes. To determine precisely the inhibitory constant (Ki) of LTC4, we used the irreversible gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitor, acivicin (AT-125), to prevent LTC4 metabolism. Incubation of lung membranes with 5 mM AT-125 for 120 min at 25 degrees C resulted in greater than 98% recovery of LTC4. Unlike L-serine-borate complex, AT-125 failed to inhibit pulmonary [3H]LTD4 binding. These results suggest that AT-125 can be used in this study. Nonlinear least squares analysis of the results of LTD4/[3H]LTD4 or ICI-198,615/[3H]LTD4 competitive binding reveals that either LTD4 (Ki = 0.49 nM) or ICI-198,615 (Ki = 6.89 nM) interacts at a single homogenous population of [3H]LTD4 binding sites. However, the data of competitive binding results of LTC4 (in the presence of AT-125) or LTE4 are best fitted for its interaction with high- and low-affinity [3H]LTD4 binding sites, designated as LTD4 alpha and LTD4 beta sites, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of hepatic organic cation transport were examined in isolated rat hepatocytes, using the model compound [methyl-3H]tributylmethylammonium (TBuMA). [3H]TBuMA is shown to be taken up into rat hepatocytes by two carrier-mediated systems in addition to a nonsaturable process. The transport mechanisms for TBuMA share common features with both the type I and type II carrier systems reported for exogenous organic cations such as procainamide ethobromide and vecuronium, respectively. Only slight effects were seen in the presence of relatively high concentrations of endogenous organic cations such as thiamine, choline and N1-methyl nicotinamide. The total uptake of [3H]TBuMA was neither influenced by an electronegative membrane potential and variations in external and internal pH, nor by the absence of Na+, K+ or Cl- in the incubation medium. The presence of the inorganic anion I- stimulated the uptake of [3H]TBuMA. An improved presentation or binding to the carrier may be involved because symport with the anion could not be demonstrated. Lowering of the temperature produced a significant reduction in the uptake velocity of [3H] TBuMA, whereas metabolic inhibitors such as valinomycin and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorphenylhydrazone reduced the uptake rate by 80 and 90%, respectively, which was correlated with the extent of ATP depletion. It is concluded that the monovalent cationic drug TBuMA can be considered as a mixed type I/type II compound that exhibits an electroneutral and anion-sensitive uptake mechanism, depending on metabolic energy. The uptake mechanism is dissimilar from Na(+)-dependent and H(+)-dependent transport systems that have been described for endogenous cations, such as thiamine, choline and N1-methylnicotinamide.\r"

  ".U": "91325099\r", 
  ".W": "Using rats with chronic i.t. catheters, dose-response curves were carried out using the hot plate (HP) test for a number of receptor-preferring opioids. The ordering of activity (i.t. ED50; nmol) on the HP was: (D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol) enkephalin (DAMGO 0.5); sufentanil (0.4); and morphine (6.6). To assess the effects of pretreatment with the irreversible mu ligand beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), rats received saline, 0.2, 2.0 or 20.0 nmol of beta-FNA. After 24 hr, base-line response latencies were not different from control animals. Dose-response curves for morphine, sufentanil and DAMGO were then obtained. Pretreatment with beta-FNA resulted in a concentration-dependent rightward shift in the agonist dose-response curves with the dose-ratio values of the respective doses of beta-FNA being for morphine: 3.5, 15.7, and 37.3; sufentanil: 1.2, 1.9, and 5.3; and DAMGO: 1.9, 4.0 and 7.3. The slopes of the agonist dose-response curves also displayed mild reductions in slope, the magnitude of which was dependent upon beta-FNA pretreatment concentrations. Testing at 6 days after beta-FNA treatment revealed a significant recovery of effect. beta-FNA (20 nmol, i.t.) had no effect on a just maximally effective dose of ST-91 (90 nmol, i.t.), an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. beta-FNA (20 nmol, i.t.), but not 2.0 nmol resulted in a modest but significant reduction in the effect of the delta agonist DPLPE (120 nmol). These data are interpreted as supportive of the hypothesis that the mu-preferring ligands differ in the number of spinal receptors that must be occupied to produce a given antinociceptive effect (i.e., they differ in intrinsic efficacy).\r"

  ".W": "The narcotic antagonist naltrexone (NTX) has both depressant and excitatory effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity, and the present study was primarily concerned with mechanisms involved in the latter modulatory action. Single channel data were recorded in cell-attached mode from cultured embryonic chick skeletal muscle myotubes at 10 degrees C under control conditions (0.15 or 0.3 microM acetylcholine, ACh) or in the presence of NTX (0.15 microM ACh plus 0.1-5 microM NTX). Distributions of open and closed times indicated that there were at least two open and four closed channel states in all cases, and evidence for at least two gateways between the open and closed classes was provided by autocorrelation data. In the absence of NTX the proportion of long (greater than 2 msec) openings increased with increasing ACh concentration, suggesting that the channel in both the mono- and biliganded forms of the receptor could open. Three possible six-state models of channel kinetics which were compatible with these findings could not be distinguished on the basis of conventional Markov modeling of open and closed times; however when account was taken of burst distributions, one model was clearly superior. Estimated transition rates in this model showed that enhanced receptor activity in the presence of NTX was due mainly to increased cooperativity of ACh binding. The results suggest that in the chick nicotinic ACh receptor, low micromolar concentrations of NTX may cause enhancement and blockade of activity by binding to a site which is allosterically coupled to several activation and gating processes.\r"

However, the clinical data indicate that the burden of proliferating cells, cytotoxicity and the folate status are also determinants of extracellular Hcy. To evaluate this further, we investigated the modulation of cellular Hcy egress by MTX, rescue agents, cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Nontransformed and chemically transformed fibroblasts and murine lymphoma cells, which are characterized by different growth behavior and MTX response, were used. The Hcy export rate was correlated positively with the proliferation rate in all cell types. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate added to fibroblasts not exposed to MTX reduced the Hcy export rate, whereas the export from the lymphoma cells was not affected. All cells types exposed to MTX were rescued by thymidine + hypoxanthine, and this allowed the assessment of Hcy export during MTX exposure without interference from cytotoxicity. In the fibroblasts, MTX with thymidine + hypoxanthine rescue induced a marked increase in Hcy export, and the dose-response paralleled the cytotoxicity curves obtained for MTX without rescue. Nontoxic concentrations of MTX without rescue enhanced the Hcy export. When MTX concentration was increased further, Hcy export was stimulated initially, and then declined rapidly as cell death ensued. MTX did not enhance the Hcy export from the lymphoma cells and, in the absence of rescue, the Hcy export from these cells declined in proportion to inhibition of cell growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In elicited (mineral oil) peritoneal guinea pig macrophages, there was a specific [3H]platelet activating factor (PAF) binding which displayed concentration dependency, saturability, high affinity (Kd = 2.2 +/- 0.2 nM, n = 15), elevated capacity (Bmax = 122,808 +/- 10,234 sites/cell, n = 15) and irreversibility. PAF(C16) and the PAF antagonists RP 59227, Ro 19-3704 and WEB 2086 prevented the binding of [3H]PAF. RP 59227 (Ki = 3.1 +/- 0.3 nM, n = 5) was about 5- and 8-fold more potent than Ro 19-3704 and WEB 2086, respectively. In competition studies, RP 59227 produced dextral and concentration-dependent shifts of the sigmoidal inhibition curve of [3H]PAF binding by PAF(C16). Macrophages exposed to PAF produced chemiluminescence signals, the magnitude of which was concentration related (pD2 = 8.40 +/- 0.03, n = 13) and which were inhibited by the oxygen radical scavengers, superoxide dismutase, catalase, deferoxamine and mannitol. RP 59227 and WEB 2086 antagonized in a noncompetitive manner (pD'2 = 7.72 +/- 0.01 and 8.15 +/- 0.05, respectively) the control PAF concentration-response curve. By contrast, Ro 19-3704 behaved as a competitive antagonist (pA2 = 8.13 +/- 0.11). The apparent noncompetitive effects of RP 59227 were not due to undisplaceable binding to PAF receptors because washing of macrophages exposed to RP 59227 allowed the recovery of PAF luminescence and PAF binding. This procedure was poorly effective to lessen the inhibitory activity of WEB 2086. In human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the weak potency of PAF was enhanced by 10-fold (pD2 = 7.61 +/- 0.06, n = 6) when polymorphonuclear leukocytes were primed for 10 min with fMLP (5 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atipamezole (1-3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the ethanol-induced reduction in exploratory head-dipping in a holeboard test whereas L 659,066 was only effective at a dose of 1 mg/kg, higher doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) and a lower dose (0.3 mg/kg) were ineffective. Atipamezole was without effect on ethanol's locomotor stimulant effect in the holeboard but L 659,066 attenuated this effect at doses less than 3 mg/kg Many alpha-2 adrenoceptor ligands also have affinity for nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites. The role these sites may play in attenuating ethanol's effects was investigated by comparing RX 821002 (methoxy idazoxan), which has little or no affinity for imidazoline-binding sites with atipamezole. Both atipamezo 1 e (1 mg/kg) and RX 821002 (0.06-0.2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated ethanol-induced hypothermia, ataxia and reduction in head-dipping, but were without effect on ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation.

The development of tolerance was also shown by pretreating mice with i.c.v.

  ".W": "Substantial in vitro and animal data suggest that methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, act as adenosine receptor antagonists. To test this hypothesis in humans, we first determined if theophylline would antagonize the effects of adenosine. Intravenous administration of adenosine, 80 micrograms/kg/min, increased heart rate 28 +/- 6 bpm, systolic blood pressure 19 +/- 5 mm Hg and minute ventilation 6.1 +/- 2.2 liters/min. All these changes were significantly attenuated during theophylline administration (17 +/- 3 bpm and 1 +/- 2 mm Hg and 1.6 +/- 0.6 liters/min, respectively, P less than .05), at a dose (10 mg/kg over 1 hr, followed by 1.8 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) that produced plasma theophylline levels of 17 +/- 2 micrograms/ml (94 microM). We then determined if chronic caffeine consumption resulted in upregulation of platelet adenosine receptors in eight normal volunteers. After 7 days of caffeine abstinence, the adenosine analog 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin-induced aggregation (EC50 = 69 nM). Subjects then were given caffeine, 250 mg p.o. 3 times a day for 7 days. Actual caffeine withdrawal, that is, virtual disappearance of caffeine in plasma, was apparent 60 hr after the last dose of caffeine. Caffeine withdrawal produced a significant shift to the left of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine inhibition of aggregation (EC50 = 49 nM, P less than .01), implying sensitization and/or upregulation of adenosine receptors as seen after chronic exposure to an antagonist. These results suggest that methylxanthines act as adenosine receptor antagonists in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been suggested recently to play an important role in immune glomerulonephritis, favoring the formation of immune deposits in glomeruli and contributing to the local inflammatory reaction. Here we sought to investigate whether urinary PAF excretion was modified in New Zealand Black x New Zealand White mice a model of genetically determined immune complex disease which mimics systemic lupus in humans and whether changes in PAF urinary excretion values correlated with the extent of proteinuria. To clarify the possible \"in vivo\" relevance of these findings we evaluated whether PAF receptor antagonist has any influence on the evolution of renal disease and survival of these mice. Our results showed that: 1) in lupus mice urinary PAF excretion increased progressively with age in New Zealand Black x White; 2) the increase in PAF excretion correlated with the severity of proteinuria; and 3) the chronic administration of a PAF receptor antagonist [L-659,989 [(+/- )-trans-2-(3-methoxy-5-methylsulfonyl-4-propoxyphenyl)-5- (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran]] starting from 26 weeks of age significantly delayed the onset of proteinuria and prolonged survival.\r"

  ".W": "Tetanus toxin labeled by the Bolton-Hunter technique possesses high specific activity and retains substantial biological activity. This material can be used to characterize tetanus toxin binding to receptors in brain membrane preparations. In experiments aimed at measuring the absorption of labeled toxin, the displacement of labeled toxin by unlabeled toxin and the on-rate and off-rate constants, the data revealed two binding sites. The high affinity site had a Kd of 0.033 to 0.070 nM and a Bmax of 0.26 to 0.4 pmol/mg of protein; the low affinity site had a Kd of 0.89 to 6.9 nM and a Bmax of 1.55 to 3.0 pmol/mg of protein. The binding of tetanus toxin to brain membranes was enhanced greatly by low pH and ionic strength. Similarly to tetanus toxin, botulinum neurotoxin could be labeled by the Bolton-Hunter technique, and its binding to brain membranes was also enhanced by low pH and ionic strength. In studies with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against tetanus toxin, the antigen-antibody interaction was not significantly altered by media with low ionic strength and pH. On the other hand, the ability of the antibody to block toxin binding to brain membranes was reduced substantially in nonphysiologic media. In a bioassay aimed at determining the effect of pH and tonicity on tissue association by toxin, low pH and ionic strength did not enhance toxicity. The biological activity of tetanus toxin was unaffected and that of botulinum neurotoxin was greatly diminished. The present findings confirm the widely reported observation that low pH and ionic strength promote tissue association by tetanus toxin, but they challenge the premise that this binding is relevant to the normal process of cell poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the known lipogenic properties of progesterone (P) in vivo, one study had previously reported a direct in vitro lipolytic activity of P on isolated adipocytes from rat parametrial adipose tissue (Sutter-Dub et al., 1981). The aim of the present study was to further investigate this finding. Parametrial, but not retroperitoneal adipocytes, isolated from 6-week-old female rats, showed an increase in glycerol release under P stimulation. Estrone, estradiol, estriol and testosterone were inactive. At 12 weeks of age, parametrial adipocytes were bigger and failed to respond to P. P-stimulated glycerol release was concentration-related between 10(-7) M and 10(-5) M. Compared to norepinephrine, P activity displayed less potency (EC50 around 5 X 10(-7) M vs. 10(-6) M, and 4-fold vs. 2-fold maximal stimulation, respectively). Compared to P, synthetic progestins used in therapeutics (medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, megestrol acetate and nomegestrol acetate) were more active at 10(-7) M but did not induce a greater response at 10(-5) M. Some 17 alpha-hydroxy and 17 alpha-acetoxy derivatives of P or 19-norprogesterone were also tested at 10(-5) M. General agreement was found between experimental lipolytic activities and known progestative agonist properties, with the exception of 19-norprogesterone, which showed a reduced lipolytic activity compared to P, in contrast with its usually higher progestative potency. The direct in vitro lipolytic activity of P was characterized as specific of age and of the parametrial adipose tissue, concentration-related, and common to synthetic progestins.\r"

  ".W": "Squirrel monkeys were trained to discriminate the selective dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 (1-[2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methoxy] ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine) from saline in a two-lever drug-discrimination procedure. After i.v. injections of GBR 12909, 10 consecutive responses on one lever produced food, whereas after i.v. saline, 10 consecutive responses on the other lever produced food. By using a cumulative-dosing procedure, several inhibitors of monoamine uptake as well as dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists were evaluated for their ability to substitute for, or attenuate, the discriminative-stimulus effects of GBR 12909. Dopamine uptake inhibitors, including GBR 12909, cocaine, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane, mazindol, bupropion and methylphenidate, as well as the dopamine releasing drug (+)-amphetamine substituted fully (greater than 80% drug-lever responding) for the training dose of GBR 12909. In contrast, the selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitors, desipramine and talsupram, and the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, citalopram, occasioned averages of only 13 to 19% drug-lever responding. The dopamine D1 agonist SKF 81297 (6-chloro-7,8-ddhydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-[1H]-3- benzazepine), the D2 agonists, (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine and quinpirole, and the nonselective dopamine agonist, (-)-apomorphine, all occasioned a majority of responses (mean = 56-82%) on the drug-appropriate lever. The D1 partial agonists, R-SKF 38393 (R-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- [1H]-3-benzazepine) and SKF 75670 (7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5- tetrahydro-[1H]-3-benzazepine), however, occasioned an average of no more than 21% drug-appropriate responding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Microinjection of neuropeptide Y (NPY) into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) induces an initial and reversible fall in arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR), along with a delayed and long-lasting blockade of cardiovascular responses to L-glutamate (L-Glu) injected into the same site and an inhibition of the baroreflex arc. By injecting NPY-receptor subtype selective agonists and NPY-related peptides into NTS we have sought to characterize the receptors that mediate these responses. Unilateral injections into NTS (9-90 pmol) of NPY as well as the Y1 receptor selective agonist [34Pro]NPY and the Y2 receptor selective fragment NPY 13-36 evoked comparable dose-dependent falls of AP and HR in the anesthetized and paralyzed rat. Injections into NTS of peptide YY or pancreatic polypeptide had no effect. Preinjection of NPY, [34Pro]NPY, NPY 13-36 (all at 90 pmol) as well as norepinephrine (6.7 nmol) virtually abolished the fall in AP and HR evoked by subsequent injections of L-Glu into NTS. Injection of peptide YY or pancreatic polypeptide (both at 90 pmol) did not affect the cardiovascular responses evoked by L-Glu in NTS. Injection of NPY (90 pmol) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla induced a slight fall in AP of -17 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than .05) and a sustained fall in HR of -44 +/- 8 beats per min (P less than .01). Injection of NPY also abolished the fall in HR and AP evoked by L-Glu in the caudal ventrolateral medulla. The profile of the cardiovascular effects elicited by the NPY-related peptides in NTS does not correspond to either of the Y1 or the Y2 receptor subtypes. The findings suggest that NPY acts on an atypical receptor in NTS to lower AP and HR. Moreover, this receptor may also interfere with the L-Glu-evoked neurotransmission in the NTS. Finally, norepinephrine shared with NPY the ability to inhibit L-Glu-evoked responses in NTS; however, a much higher dose of norepinephrine (than NPY) was required.\r"

  ".W": "myo-Inositol uptake in prisms of rat parotid glands was investigated by measuring both the accumulation of free myo-[3H] inositol into the cytosol and its incorporation into phospholipids. Total myo-[3H]inositol uptake involved two distinct processes, a prominent one which is saturable and sodium-dependent (Km, 95 microM; Vmax, 8 pmol/mg of protein per min) and a minor one, nonsaturable and sodium-independent. Phloretin and cytochalasin B, two inhibitors of hexose transport, and D-glucose, but only at high concentrations (greater than 10 mM), inhibited myo-[3H]inositol uptake. Dixon plots of the data indicated that D-glucose inhibition was noncompetitive suggesting that myo-inositol and D-glucose are transported by different carriers. Electrogenic cotransport of sodium and myo-inositol, rather than energy derived from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, seems to be involved in the transport process. Thus, ouabain, monensin or veratridine, all of which increase intracellular sodium concentrations, reduced myo-[3H]inositol uptake, whereas dinitrophenol, potassium cyanide and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone were without effect. Substance P affected only the sodium-dependent uptake process of myo-[3H]inositol, this inhibitory effect requiring extracellular calcium. Similar observations were made with the muscarinic agonist carbachol. From these results, an increase in intracellular sodium concentration linked to the activation of calcium-sensitive cation-permeant channels appears to be responsible for the inhibitory effects of substance P and carbachol on myo-[3H]inositol uptake, these effects being mediated respectively by NK1 and muscarinic receptors coupled to a phospholipase C.\r"
