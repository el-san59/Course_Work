There were no significant differences between the randomized groups in terms of age, ulcer size, or transfusion requirements. We achieved hemostasis in 95% of all patients. Re-bleeding rates were 25% and 23% in patients treated with the multipolar probe and injection sclerosis, respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality (14% multipolar probe, 7% injection sclerosis). Patients over the age of 70, those whose onset of bleeding was while an inpatient, and those with an ulcer larger than 2 cm were more likely to have a poor outcome, regardless of the type of endoscopic therapy. Injection sclerosis and multipolar electrocoagulation are equally effective in controlling bleeding from peptic ulcer.\r"

Nine hundred and forty-eight consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent endoscopy and 91 patients with active bleeding from peptic ulcer were randomized to receive laser (N = 30), heater probe (N = 31), and bipolar electrocoagulation (N = 30). The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base was assessed at endoscopy. The three treatment groups were comparable in their clinical and endoscopic characteristics. There was no significant difference among patients treated with laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the rate of re-bleeding (10%, 19.4%, and 10%), duration of hospital stay (4, 4, and 5 days), and proportion requiring emergency surgery (7%, 13%, and 7%), but the cost per patient was higher with laser than heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulation. The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base did not affect the re-bleeding rate. No complication was reported. We conclude that the three modalities were equally effective and safe in endoscopic hemostasis but because bipolar electrocoagulation and heater probe were cheaper, they were recommended for use.\r"

Blood flow rate (BFR) from severed gastric serosal vessels (diameter, 1.6 to 2.2 mm) was measured for 3 min (ml/min) for a control group and the agent used. The agents tested were 5 ml of normal saline (NS), 5 ml of 3% hypertonic saline (HS), 5 ml of 1:10,000 epinephrine in NS, 5 ml of 1:10,000 epinephrine/HS, 5 ml of 1:20,000 epinephrine/HS, 2 ml of old thrombin \"cocktail\" (thrombin, cephapirin + 1% tetradecyl), and 2 ml of fresh thrombin cocktail (total seven). One agent was tested per dog; there were one to two dogs in each subgroup. All of the agents showed significant reduction in BFR (except old thrombin) when compared with BFR of control vessels. The reduction ranged from 30% to more than 75% after 1:10 epinephrine/HS. Complete hemostasis was achieved in up to 47% of vessels using 1:20 epinephrine/HS. Overall, the epinephrine solutions achieved the best results. No systemic effects were observed with the use of any of the agents. Histological studies showed that epinephrine caused mild tissue damage, whereas the cocktail caused significant tissue necrosis. This serosal vessel model permits comparison of the effectiveness of each agent; however, clinical extrapolation to mucosal vessels in a patient and the long-term histological changes are not known.\r"

We describe the time course of change in the ulcer size, and suggest that such ulceration can be used for the endoscopic assessment of factors important in ulcer genesis and healing. Endoscopic reflectance spectrophotometric measurement of indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2) were performed in a separate group of dogs (N = 4) with ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. We found a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in IHB and ISO2 immediately before (97 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 3, respectively) and after (138 +/- 7 and 21 +/- 5, respectively) the ethanol injection. At 24 hours after the ethanol injection, the IHB at the lesion margin (141 +/- 14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that at the adjacent mucosa (101 +/- 4), whereas the ISO2 measurements were not significantly different in these two locations, 34 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 2, respectively. We conclude that (1) injection of 3 mol of absolute ethanol into the submucosa of the canine stomach provides an animal model of gastric ulceration in which the ulcer can be examined repeatedly with the aid of the endoscope; (2) in this ulcer model, ischemia with congestion (increases IHB, decreases ISO2) precedes the development of gross mucosal ulcerations; and (3) the margin of the established ulceration in this model exhibits hyperemia (increases IHB, normal ISO2) which mimics that of a healing gastric ulcer.\r"

Patients referred for abnormal barium studies (100%), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement (97%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (83%) were most likely to have a procedure. Sixty-nine percent of consultations from medical specialties had endoscopy compared with 44% from surgical specialties and 45% from other specialties. There were no differences noted between the two practices. We conclude that gastroenterology is predominantly a procedure-oriented subspecialty. Procedures are performed most commonly on patients referred for conditions that are likely to require endoscopic biopsy or therapeutics and on patients referred from medical specialists.\r"

Among the minute lesions, aphthoid lesions were found in the highest incidence (85%). It was difficult to determine the presence of aphthoid lesions without the spray of indigocarmine, which facilitated detection. Histologically, granulomas were found in 15% of patients with Crohn's disease. Aphthoid lesions were not associated with superficial erosions and lymphoid follicles. The presence of aphthoid lesions in the rectum and sigmoid colon would be a strong indication of the presence of Crohn's disease.\r"

Recently, a new low-sodium cleansing solution was described and introduced as a major advance, allegedly providing a distinctly better taste and improving compliance. We compared the taste of both solutions, seeking a possible preference applying a double-blind randomized design. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers tasted one of the two solutions without a direct comparison. Both solutions were found to have a similar palatability and an equal salty taste. A different group of 50 volunteers compared the two solutions. Twenty-one preferred the standard solution, 25 preferred the new solution (not significant), and 4 subjects had no preference. Among the subjects basing their preference on the saltiness of the solutions, 18 estimated the standard solution to taste more salty than the new low sodium solution, while 18 volunteers found the new solution to taste more salty than the standard solution. This study does not confirm a taste preference for the new low-salt polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution as compared with the standard solution for colonic cleansing. The difference in the salt concentrations of the two solutions could not regularly be distinguished by a group of healthy volunteers.\r"

Total procedure time was 31 min for the atropine group and 35 min for the placebo group (p greater than 0.05), and there was no overall difference in the total amount of intra-procedural medications required. No statistically significant differences were observed relative to the number or severity of vagal episodes, and neither the endoscopist nor the patients noted any differences in the ease or tolerance of the procedure (p greater than 0.05). Although these results fail to demonstrate a significant benefit of atropine when given routinely as premedication for colonoscopy, this study does not rule out the potential usefulness of atropine in counteracting vagal episodes when they occur.\r"

  ".W": "Biopsies of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine are most often obtained using the traditional advance-and-close method with flexible endoscopes by extending an open forceps several millimeters beyond the endoscope tip to sample the mucosa, all under direct vision. We developed an alternative \"turn-and-suction\" endoscopic biopsy technique that permits the acquisition of larger mucosal samples. The biopsy forceps is advanced into the lumen, opened, and withdrawn backward until it is flush with the endoscope tip. Next, the endoscope tip is turned gently into the wall while air is suctioned from the lumen, and the biopsy forceps is very slightly advanced and then closed, usually without direct visualization. After straightening the endoscope tip, the biopsy is obtained by withdrawing the forceps and avulsing a superficial mucosal sample. By using this new method, we have safely taken over 10,000 biopsies without complications in endoscopic surveillance research protocols in patients at risk for gastrointestinal cancer. To compare the sizes of biopsies obtained with these two techniques, histologic sections of 341 mucosal samples from 12 patients with chronic ulcerative colitis were studied retrospectively. The mean greatest length of biopsy sections using the traditional technique was 4.72 mm, and using our new technique was 7.35 mm (56% longer). The turn-and-suction endoscopic biopsy method is best applied when flat mucosa is randomly sampled to seek microscopic pathologic changes that are not visible endoscopically, and may be advantageous for various non-histologic research analyses of gastrointestinal mucosa which are limited by tissue quantity.\r"

In an in vitro electrical circuit, equivalent current was measured in both the papillotome wire and the standard guidewire. Plastic-coated guidewires did not allow any current flow. The advantages of flexible single lumen papillotomes and maintenance of deep biliary cannulation over a guidewire may be combined if insulated plastic-coated guidewires are used.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study from 1988 to 1990, 132 patients with suspected pancreatic tumor were examined with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and ERCP. The final diagnosis of 102 pancreatic tumors of different origin (76 malignant and 26 inflammatory tumors) and the exclusion of a pancreatic tumor in 30 patients was made by operation (N = 47), puncture (N = 36), autopsy (N = 3), or follow-up of a mean of 51 weeks (N = 46). Sensitivity and specificity in pancreatic tumor diagnosis were significantly higher for EUS (99% and 100%) than for US (67%/40%) and CT (77%/53%) and equal to ERCP (sensitivity 90%). This was even more obvious in small pancreatic tumors of 3 cm and less. However, as with the other imaging procedures, EUS was not able to differentiate reliably malignant from inflammatory pancreatic masses (accuracy 76% for malignancy and 46% for focal inflammation). From analysis of the endosonographic pattern of pancreatic tumors, no consistent morphologic features were identified which could have been specifically attributed to malignant or inflammatory masses. Our results show that EUS is superior to US and CT and equal to ERCP in pancreatic tumor diagnosis. In contrast to the indirect evidence obtained by ERCP, EUS provides direct visualization of tumor size and shape in almost all patients examined. Thus, EUS should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic tumors.\r"

Using a limited number of drugs to provide anesthesia further improves predictability; it is more difficult to assign a cause for delayed emergence when multiple agents have been administered. We believe the recovery period is often more difficult to manage safely than induction and maintenance of anesthesia. During this phase, the effects of surgical trauma are superimposed on the patient's preexisting disease state, the anesthetic level is changing rapidly, respiratory function has not returned to normal, and circulatory reflexes may not have been regained. Because the patient is being moved from the operating room and care of the patient is being transferred from one person or team to others, vigilance and treatment may also be impaired. It is a period of care that warrants further study.\r"

Recognition that mechanical ventilation represents a major departure from spontaneous ventilation should enable anesthesiologists to compensate for the increases in dead space ventilation and the propensity for alveolar collapse that accompany low volume mechanical ventilation. The use of postoperative regional analgesic techniques to alleviate respiratory compromise constitutes both current clinical practice and an area of active, ongoing investigation. Gone are the days when the anesthesiologist's responsibility stopped at the recovery room door. Today, anesthesiologists with expertise in postoperative pain management, cardiovascular physiology, and intensive ventilatory care are able to provide patients an improved likelihood of avoiding postoperative respiratory complications.\r"

Restoration of muscle strength is a function of pharmacological antagonism of residual NMB, spontaneous recovery as the concentration of relaxant declines at the neuromuscular junction, or both. In addition to recovery of \"normal function\" by clinical and monitoring criteria, some margin of safety of neuromuscular function must be restored. As new relaxants with very short half-lives become available, it is likely that steady states of relaxation will increasingly be maintained with continuous infusions. In this setting, the rapid rate of spontaneous recovery of both clinical neuromuscular function and an adequate margin of safety may vastly reduce the need for pharmacological antagonism.\r"

During the hyperventilation per se, cluster headache patients and controls showed absolute values of end-tidal CO2 and of SaO2 of the same order of magnitude. In the posthyperventilation phase, however, the average of the lowest SaO2 levels was lower in controls than in cluster headache patients. In the posthyperventilation phase, headache patients outside the cluster period showed a trend more similar to that of the controls with respect to SaO2 than did those inside the cluster period. The observed discrepancy might, if reproducible, be a consequence of an altered chemoreceptor sensitivity in cluster headache patients during the bout.\r"

When the patients were treated with nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, the TXA2 increase in saliva did not occur. These results suggest both a systemic and local effect in the classical migraine attacks. We explain and discuss our results by referring to the PGI2: TXA2 equilibrium system. Nicardipine action might be related to its ability to reduce the calcium entry into the cell induced by thromboxane.\r"

After 5 months of continuous treatment, he developed scopolamine intoxication followed by the appearance of recurrent classic migraine attacks. He had never suffered from headache or migraine prior to TS intoxication. The migraine attacks comprised a prodrome of apathy, bad mood and loss of appetite lasting several hours. An aura of scintillating spots, left arm numbness and paresthesias lasting several minutes was followed by a severe throbbing unilateral headache with photophobia, sonophobia and nausea. After one year of repeated follow-up examination, he continued to suffer from the attacks once every 10 to 14 days, with no identified precipitating factors. We are not aware of similar cases in the medical literature. Although it is not possible to establish TS intoxication as a causal effect of the appearance of classic migraine in our patient, the temporal association and clinical course are very supportive of this assumption. Central nervous system neurotransmitter imbalance of cardiovascular alterations may possibly be implicated.\r"

The attacks lasted 1/2-1 min. and occurred only infrequently, i.e. once or twice in 1-4 weeks, except for a week recently when there were up to 20 or more typical attacks per day, with the usual ipsilateral, autonomic accompaniments. Due to the benign nature and low frequency of attacks, the diagnosis would have been most difficult to establish prior to the occurrence of this shortlasting period with more marked symptoms. A variety of precipitation mechanisms were present, partly concerning the V 2-3 areas, partly concerning the neck. Precipitation mechanisms in \"SUNCT\" to some extent seem to differ from those in trigeminal neuralgia. It is remarkable that all four hitherto reported cases are males.\r"

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are used as examples, providing the background for understanding weaning in difficult cases. Weaning is conceptualized as a process of three phases: preweaning, weaning, and extubation. Important considerations during each phase are examined.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine how care givers adapt to having ventilator-dependent adults at home. Twenty families were interviewed in their homes by using an eight-question semistructured interview guide. The Roy model was used as a framework to analyze these data. Two instruments, the Family Coping Scale (F-COPES) and the Family APGAR, were administered to measure family coping and function. Patients, aged 18 to 74 years, required 24-hour (n = 9), 12- to 15-hour (n = 5), or 8- to 12-hour (n = 6) home ventilatory support and had neuromuscular or trauma-related diagnoses. Months receiving ventilation ranged from 2 to 312. Care givers, aged 20 to 74 years, were all relatives. Six care givers reported using support services outside their extended family. F-COPES scores fell within national norms whether the patient required 24-hour or less ventilation. Family APGAR results revealed satisfaction with overall family function although scores decreased over time. Interview data indicated that essential knowledge and skills are taught but additional information is desired. Both positive and negative responses to care giving were identified, with the majority of responses being concerned with role mastery, self-concept, and dependency issues. Positive themes in the interviews reflected confidence in ventilator care, satisfaction with the decision to care for their family member at home, and improved quality of life. Negative themes in the interviews reflected the burden of care giving, the dependence of the patient on the care giver, resentment, and hopelessness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dyspnea, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and difference between real and ideal weight had the most marked effects on the correlation between the two methods, with lesser influence by left ventricular ejection fraction, height, weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and aortic regurgitation. TEB and thermodilution cardiac outputs were correlated, at r = 0.51 (p less than 0.00009), but the low reliability and low percentage of TEB readings within 0.5 L/min of thermodilution cardiac outputs (31%) renders TEB inadequate for clinical measurement of cardiac outputs in this patient population.\r"

Thirty patients with MI were tested during their first and second self-bath on 2 consecutive days between 2 and 9 days after MI. The bathing methods produced significant increases from the resting values in all the variables (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant differences between the resting and recovery values existed (p greater than 0.05). Ten subjects experienced atypical responses to bathing as indicated by heart rate and blood pressures. Fatigue was the most frequently encountered symptom at rest and during the bathing activities. The findings suggest that low-risk patients with MI can choose between a sitting sink bath or a sitting shower as their first self-bath after MI, based on preferences. However, because the bathing activity (and not the bathing method) did produce some atypical responses in one third of the subjects, readiness to engage in bathing activities should be individually assessed by objective and subjective criteria.\r"

A correlational survey design was used to assess patients' (n = 46) illness responses 9 weeks after the cardiac event. Patients also participated in a symptom-limited exercise test. The findings suggested that the individual's return to greater activity levels after a cardiac illness was associated with less depression and illness severity, and higher levels of objective physical functioning, physical recovery, and self-esteem. Further, patients' objective physical functioning was associated not only with greater subjective physical functioning but also with greater levels of physical recovery and mastery.\r"

The Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) has been used by several researchers to identify the needs of family members when a relative is admitted to a critical care setting. However, no research to date has comprehensively evaluated the instrument's content validity, test--retest reliability, or readability. The CCFNI, after review by a panel of 16 experts, was given on two separate occasions to a random sample of 51 family members of adult patients in both medical and surgical intensive care units. Overall content validity was established, but the panel found numerous redundancies among the need statements, suggesting that several items might need to be eliminated or combined. Among family members, a percentage of exact agreement of 70% or greater was calculated for 86.7% of the need statements demonstrating acceptable test--retest reliability. The Gunning Fog Index, used to evaluate readability, was calculated at 9.0, indicating that the CCFNI could be read and understood by those with a ninth grade reading level. Suggestions are made for additional studies to establish the reliability and validity of this widely used instrument.\r"

Eighty-eight consecutive patients who had had a laminectomy for degenerative lumbar stenosis between 1983 and 1986 were studied. Eight of the patients had had a concomitant arthrodesis. The follow-up evaluation included a review of charts and standardized questionnaires that were completed by the patients. One year postoperatively, five patients (6 per cent) had had a second operation and five still had severe pain. By the time of the latest follow-up, in 1989, fifteen (17 per cent) of the original eighty-eight patients had had a repeat operation because of instability or stenosis; twenty-one (30 per cent) of the seventy patients who were evaluated by questionnaire in 1989 had severe pain. The factors found to be associated with a poor long-term outcome, defined as severe pain or the need for a repeat operation, or both, included co-existing illnesses (such as osteoarthrosis, cardiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic pulmonary disease) (p = 0.004), the duration of follow-up (p = 0.01), and an initial laminectomy involving a single interspace (p = 0.04). We concluded that the long-term outcome of decompressive laminectomy is less favorable than has been previously reported, and that co-morbidity and a single-interspace laminectomy are risk factors for a poor outcome.\r"

The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine.\r"

The meaning of these morphological changes is not clear. However, the spatial relationship between the various cells suggests the possibility that the transformed endothelial cells, reticular cells, and polymorphic mesenchymal cells may be interrelated and may either be osteoblast progenitor cells or may in some way lead to the appearance of osteoblasts in the early callus.\r"

At the time of the most recent follow-up, twenty-one implants (19 per cent) had failed, all due to problems with the tibial component. A patellar component was not used, and no noteworthy patellar problems were encountered after the operation. There were no infections about the prostheses, and no femoral implant was revised. The most common cause of failure was collapse of the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau, which occurred in fourteen knees. The prosthesis loosened without collapse of bone in two knees, and five knees were revised because of gross wear of the polyethylene. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which revision of the prosthesis was recommended, the cumulative rate of survival was 84 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, +/- 7 per cent) at five years and 77 +/- 10 per cent at six years. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which the knee replacement was actually done, the five-year rate of survival was the same. No significant differences were demonstrated between groups that were stratified by age, sex, weight, or primary diagnosis. We therefore do not recommend the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement of the design that was evaluated in this study.\r"

Eleven of the twenty index procedures were performed on patients who were one year old or less. A progressive flexion deformity of the knee developed after all twenty index procedures. Twenty-six secondary procedures were needed, including disarticulation at the knee, posterior release, extension osteotomy, femorofibular arthrodesis, and biceps-to-quadriceps transfer, and one patient had a second attempt at centralization of the fibula. The duration of follow-up after the initial centralization of the fibula ranged from four years to twenty-two years and seven months (average, twelve years and four months). Seven patients (eight limbs) in whom the index procedure resulted in failure had a satisfactory result after disarticulation at the knee. The patients who did not have secondary disarticulation at the knee are also considered to have had a failed index procedure because they had a flexion deformity at the latest follow-up. Attempts to reconstruct the knee joint by centralization of the fibula are not warranted for patients who have congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete. Early disarticulation at the knee and fitting with a prosthesis, with close follow-up, is the treatment of choice.\r"

  ".W": "The role of revascularization in the nutritional support of repair of the flexor tendons is not completely understood. To explore the extent to which intrasynovial flexor tendons revascularize after transection and suture, a vascular injection study was carried out in a canine model. The tendons to the second and fifth digits of the forepaw in twelve adult mongrel dogs were transected and repaired. There were twenty-four experimental tendons and twenty-four normal tendons. The limb was placed in a polyurethane shoulder-spica cast, and the paw was treated with immediate protected passive mobilization. At three, seven, ten, seventeen, and twenty-eight days, the animals were killed and the major arteries supplying both the paw that had been operated on (left) and the contralateral normal paw (right) were injected with 200 milliliters of India ink. Segments of repaired and normal tendons were then clarified by a modified Spalteholz technique. The normal tendons demonstrated a well developed mesotenon that provided vascularization of the proximal portion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon. A consistent three-cubic-millimeter avascular intrasynovial portion of tendon was noted. Distally, vessels arose from the vinculum breve, supplying the terminal twenty millimeters of tendon substance. In the experimental tendons, longitudinal and transverse clarified sections showed consistent revascularization of the site of repair by proximal vessels in the absence of ingrowth of peripheral adhesions. Vessels in the epitenon progressively extended for a distance of ten millimeters, through normally avascular regions, to reach the site of repair by the seventeenth postoperative day. Intratendinous vessels about the site of repair consistently originated from surface vessels, rather than from extensions of pre-existing intratendinous vessels. New vessels penetrated all areas, including the normally avascular volar segments of tendon, irrespective of previous topical zones of avascularity. Proximal vascular plexi were characterized by large tortuous vessels with frequent circuitous branches. More distal vessels had a longitudinally oriented, feathery appearance.\r"

  ".W": "A study was performed on the effect of the addition of an extra-articular procedure involving tenodesis of the iliotibial band to a reconstruction with a bone-patellar ligament-bone allograft for the treatment of chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. One hundred and four patients were divided into two groups for comparison: Group 1 (sixty-four patients) was treated with only an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and Group 2 (forty patients), with both an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and the extra-articular procedure. Preoperatively, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of twenty variables, including body weight, level of activity, anterior-posterior displacements, number of previous operations, and duration of follow-up. All of the patients returned for follow-up evaluation twenty-three to fifty-four months (mean, thirty-five months) postoperatively. All were treated with the same postoperative program of immediate motion of the knee and rehabilitation. The results were evaluated with the use of a comprehensive subjective and objective system that rated the twenty factors. Both procedures proved to be effective in decreasing functional limitations and symptoms and in improving the level of sports activity and the over-all scores. The results in Group 2 were significantly better than those in Group 1, as measured with tests done with the KT-1000 arthrometer (p less than 0.01) and with regard to the level of sports activity (p less than 0.05) and the over-all scores (p less than 0.01). There was no postoperative difference between the two groups in terms of the results on pivot-shift or isokinetic testing, patellofemoral crepitus, functional limitations, or symptoms. The program of rehabilitation effectively restored 0 to 135 degrees of motion to all but four knees, which lacked 5 degrees of extension at the most recent follow-up. The over-all rate of failure for both groups was 11 per cent. However, the rate of failure was 16 per cent (ten of sixty-four knees) in Group 1 and only 3 per cent (one of forty knees) in Group 2. This difference was significant (p less than 0.05). The extra-articular procedure appeared to provide support to the healing intra-articular allograft by reducing deleterious forces and tibial displacements, and to restore the secondary restraints provided by the lateral iliotibial band. The results suggest that the combination of the procedures is of value in young, athletically active people who have chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The limbs in which the fracture was treated with external fixation and supplemental lag-screws had more than twice the rate of refracture of the control limbs (11 compared with 5 per cent), and the percentage of fractures having supplemental lag-screw fixation that needed bone-grafting to achieve union was more than twice that in the group treated with external fixation alone. We concluded that the routine use of supplemental lag-screw fixation is not indicated in patients who have an open fracture of the tibial shaft that has been stabilized with external fixation.\r"

  ".W": "The cases of twenty patients who had an arthrodesis in which an intramedullary nail was used for stabilization were reviewed at an average follow-up of six years. The predominant indications were infection after total knee arthroplasty and post-traumatic pain and instability. Other indications included aseptic loosening of the components of a total knee arthroplasty, reconstruction after resection of a giant-cell tumor, non-union of a fracture of the distal part of the femur or the proximal part of the tibia, and failed external-compression arthrodesis. Success was achieved in seventeen patients (85 per cent), and functional stability immediately postoperatively was gained in all twenty. Of the three patients in whom the arthrodesis failed, all had sustained an intraoperative fracture, and infection eventually developed. Of the twelve nails that were secured to the greater trochanter with a loop of stainless-steel wire, none showed evidence of proximal migration. Of the eight nails that were not thus secured, two migrated proximally, necessitating removal of the nail. Two drawbacks to this operation are the long duration and the large amount of blood that is lost. The major advantage is that a high percentage of patients have progression to a stable fusion despite serious problems. Furthermore, all but seven patients (including the six who had a tumor or who had sustained an intraoperative fracture) were able to bear full weight by the second postoperative week. Only a few patients needed an external support for walking.\r"

  ".W": "The histomorphometric, material, and structural properties of the reparative tissue and bone that formed in a two-millimeter tibial defect in dogs were determined at two, four, eight, and twelve weeks after the operation. At two weeks, the tibial defect was filled mainly with undifferentiated connective tissue. After two weeks, the relative proportion of undifferentiated connective tissue decreased and the amount of bone progressively increased throughout the twelve weeks. New bone formed primarily by intramembranous ossification, with a small degree of endochondral ossification. At twelve weeks, bone occupied 62 per cent of the defect. The calcium content of the reparative tissue increased between four and eight weeks and then, at twelve weeks, reached a plateau of 77 per cent that of normal cortical bone. Anisotropy of the new bone that formed in the defect increased from 13.8 per cent to 26 per cent, and the mean width of the trabecular bone increased 27 per cent between the eighth and twelfth weeks. Maximum torque and torsional stiffness increased between two and eight weeks and then, by twelve weeks, the values leveled off at 44 and 29 per cent of the values for intact bone. Indentation stiffness increased between the fourth and twelfth weeks; at twelve weeks, it was 22 per cent of the stiffness of normal cortical bone. Indentation stiffness increased 283 per cent between eight and twelve weeks, despite insignificant changes in calcium content, amount of new bone, non-osseous space, water content, or volume of trabecular bone during this time. This change in indentation stiffness did correlate with increases in anisotropy of the new bone between eight and twelve weeks.\r"

Only one specimen showed radiographic evidence of loosening; the other 15 were stable to mechanical testing at 17.0 Nm of torque. In all 16 specimens, the cement-bone interface was intact with little fibrous tissue formation. By contrast, separation at the cement-prosthesis interface and fractures in the cement mantle were frequent. The most common early feature was debonding of the cement from the metal, seen at the proximal and distal ends of the prosthesis. Specimens which had been in place for longer also showed circumferential fractures in the cement, near the cement-metal interface, and radial fractures extending from this interface into the cement and sometimes to the bony interface. The most extensive cement fractures appeared to have started at or near sharp corners in the metal, or where the cement mantle was thin or incomplete. Fractures were also related to voids in the cement. The time relationship in this series suggested that long-term failure of the fixation of cemented femoral components was primarily mechanical, starting with debonding at the interface between the cement and the prosthesis, and continuing as slowly developing fractures in the cement mantle.\r"

Histology showed a fibroblastic reaction with abundant titanium lying free and within histiocytes, and a scanty foreign-body giant-cell reaction. Surface analysis of the removed femoral components and chemical analysis of the excised tissues is described. Tissue reaction in response to the metal-wear debris may have contributed to the early failure of these implants.\r"

A further six hips were radiologically and symptomatically loose. Pain was mild or absent in 83%. Over half were able to walk a mile or more; 70% flexed more than 70 degrees; 15% had a flexion deformity, but in only 7% was this more than 10 degrees. The mean Harris hip score was 74.

At surgery we found tissue discoloration and macroscopic corrosion in four of the nine prostheses, located at the head-neck junction. Histological examination in most cases showed extensive necrosis associated with metal particles, indicating metal toxicity. Metallographic examination of the prosthetic heads revealed structural imperfections and inhomogeneity of the metal. We suggest that the crevice between the head and neck is a potential site of corrosion in modular designs.\r"

Significantly more cables broke when placed inside the femoral canal than when the cable was placed round the femoral shaft (58% as against 9.5%, difference p less than 0.01). The high incidence of breakage may have resulted from contact between the stainless steel cable and the titanium prosthesis, from the acute angulation, or because of the lower fatigue strength of stainless steel. Better results have been obtained using cables with a higher fatigue strength, passed outside the proximal femur.\r"

In every case the cartilage and bone erosion was centred anteriorly on the plateau and the posterior cartilage was intact. The site of the lesion and the intact state of the cruciate ligaments taken together explain why varus deformity was observed only in the extended knee, and why the deformity was correctable and had not become fixed. Failure of the anterior cruciate ligament may allow the erosion to extend posteriorly, producing fixed varus deformity and leading to degeneration of the lateral compartment. Anteromedial osteoarthritis is a distinct clinicopathological entity; its radiographic features enable it to be diagnosed from lateral radiographs; its anatomical features render it suitable for treatment by unicompartmental arthroplasty.\r"

During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines. In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium. The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomy of the cubital tunnel and its relationship to ulnar nerve compression is not well documented. In 27 cadaver elbows the proximal edge of the roof of the cubital tunnel was formed by a fibrous band that we call the cubital tunnel retinaculum (CTR). The band is about 4 mm wide, extending from the medial epicondyle to the olecranon, and perpendicular to the flexor carpi ulnaris aponeurosis. Variations in the CTR were classified into four types. In type 0 (n = 1) the CTR was absent. In type Ia (n = 17), the retinaculum was lax in extension and taut in full flexion. In type Ib (n = 6) it was tight in positions short of full flexion (90 degrees to 120 degrees). In type II (n = 3) it was replaced by a muscle, the anconeus epitrochlearis. The CTR appears to be a remnant of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle and its function is to hold the ulnar nerve in position. Variations in the anatomy of the CTR may explain certain types of ulnar neuropathy. Its absence (type 0 CTR) permits ulnar nerve displacement. Type Ia is normal and does not cause ulnar neuropathy. Type Ib can cause dynamic nerve compression with elbow flexion. Type II may be associated with static compression due to the bulk of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle.\r"

The indication for surgery was based on the severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia. The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47.7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes. On final review the average score was 88. The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72% of hips and dysplasia was improved in all cases. The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change.\r"

In the patients with transient synovitis, capsular distension was attributed to synovial effusion, while in the patients with Perthes' disease it was produced by thickening of the synovial membrane. Neither capsular distension nor thickening of the joint cartilage was seen in the contralateral normal hip in the patients with transient synovitis, but they were common in early Perthes' disease. Ultrasonography may provide significant diagnostic clues to differentiate early Perthes' from transient synovitis.\r"

The injuries resulted from falls or motor vehicle accidents, with considerable delay in diagnosis. Flexion radiographs showed atlas-dens intervals (ADI) of 6, 7, 8 and 13 mm; all four patients were treated by posterior fusion at C1-C2 after the failure of conservative treatment. In one child with quadriparesis and a fixed ADI of 13 mm, transoral anterior resection of the odontoid was performed before the fusion. Diagnosis of this traumatic lesion requires a high level of suspicion. Conservative treatment is likely to fail; surgical stabilisation is indicated.\r"

This difference may be because patients with lower limb symptoms had been referred later in the course of the syndrome. We showed by repeated tests that after an average of 49 days there was a slow return to normality. The estimation of pressure-pain thresholds may help in the earlier diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy.\r"

At hemiarthroplasty the articular surface also appears to be offset posteriorly with respect to the humeral shaft. Coracoid impingement may occur if this offset is not accommodated. An analysis was made of 29 cadaveric humeri using an industrial co-ordinate measuring machine. The position of the centre of the head was defined with respect to the humeral shaft and transepicondylar plane. The humeral articular surface was found to be retroverted by 21.4 degrees and its centre offset posteriorly by 4.7 mm. Previous interpretation of retroversion did not take into account the posterior displacement, and this may be of importance in improving future prosthetic design.\r"

Both clinical and mechanical healing were enhanced in the group subjected to micromovement, compared to those treated with frames in a fixed mode possessing an overall stiffness similar to that of others in common clinical use.

The annual incidence was 0.4 per 100,000, comprising 32% of all soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities or the trunk wall. Compared to deep-seated sarcomas, subcutaneous tumours were half the size at diagnosis, more common in the lower leg and foot, more often malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and of a lower grade of malignancy. None of the low-grade and only 7% of the high-grade tumours recurred locally after wide local excision without radiotherapy. The cumulative five-year survival for all 129 patients was 80%. Multivariate analysis identified only high grade of malignancy and the size of the tumour (greater than 5 cm) as independent prognostic factors. We conclude that systemic or local adjuvant therapy is not generally indicated for subcutaneous sarcoma because of the good prognosis and low local recurrence rate after wide excision.\r"

Shortening of as much as 7.5 cm in the femur and 5 cm in the tibia was achieved in men of normal height without any loss of function. Complications were seen with all surgical techniques despite the use of modern implants. Most problems arose from inadequate stabilisation of the osteotomy. The most reliable method of femoral shortening was open subtrochanteric osteotomy with preservation of the isthmus, and fixation with an intramedullary nail locked at its proximal end. In tibial shortening, bone excision should be at the level of the flare in the lower diaphysis in order to achieve reliable bone healing. Simple intramedullary nail fixation should be supplemented with a long-leg cast for six weeks or the nail should be locked at both ends to prevent postoperative distraction or rotation.\r"

Efficacy in reducing pressure-induced wheals and flares was evaluated. Histologic changes were also assessed with the skin window technique in weight-induced wheals. Results showed a statistically significant reduction in weight-induced wheal area (p less than 0.01) after cetirizine therapy; this improvement was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in eosinophil recruitment as demonstrated by the skin window technique (p = 0.0029). Subsequently, 14 patients with delayed pressure urticaria underwent biopsy before and after 3 weeks of cetirizine therapy to evaluate the drug's histologic effects. A blinded observer performed the histologic studies. Weight-induced lesions showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, primarily polymorphonuclear (neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas the unchallenged skin sites were normal. Cell counts from pressure-induced lesions showed a significant reduction in eosinophils after cetirizine treatment.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews the contribution of cell-mediated inflammatory responses to the immediate immunoglobulin E-dependent allergic reaction. Apparently eosinophils play an important part in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions. Some new H1 antihistamines may also have non-H1-mediated antiinflammatory properties. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies of allergic and normal subjects, we showed that oral cetirizine, at dosages of 10 and 20 mg/day, significantly inhibited wheal-and-erythema reactions induced by grass pollen, 48/80, histamine, platelet-activating factor acether, and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. In the first study, cutaneous eosinophil migration was significantly inhibited by cetirizine at pollen and 48/80 skin test sites (61%, p less than 0.01, and 53%, p less than 0.01, respectively), although no change was observed at histamine skin test sites. Inhibition of neutrophil accumulation was also observed at pollen and 48/80 sites (41%, p less than 0.1, and 31%, p less than 0.1, respectively). Monocyte accumulation was not affected by cetirizine. In the second study, cetirizine suppressed the eosinophil influx induced by pollen, platelet-activating factor, 400 ng, and platelet-activating factor, 40 ng (63%, p less than 0.001; 58.5%, p less than 0.001; and 57.8%, p less than 0.01, respectively). This inhibition was effective 2 hours after challenge and persisted through hours 4, 8, and 24. N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine induced a weak eosinophil accumulation that was inhibited by cetirizine.\r"

  ".W": "Atopic dermatitis is a genetically determined inflammatory condition in which the primary defect is expressed in one or more hematopoietic cells that infiltrate the skin. It is a multifactorial disease with inflammation triggered by a variety of factors. Among these, atopic dermatitis has been experimentally induced and reproduced by emotional-stress interviews and food challenges only. The inflammatory events of atopic dermatitis appear to initiated by mast cells, but eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes (predominantly CD4) also are present in lesions. The secondary effects of inflammation are a dry, brittle stratum corneum and pruritus, causing excoriation and a lichenified epidermal layer resulting from chronic rubbing. Therapeutic approaches to atopic dermatitis may be directed at several points in the evolution of the disease. Agents including emollients are needed to preserve and restore the stratum corneum barrier, and effective antipruritics are required to reduce the self-inflicted damage to the involved skin. Various other agents may be needed to antagonize mediators or cytokines and to inhibit cytokine expression and release from lesional, immune-effector cells. Likewise, new phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium-active agents, and antiallergic drugs may be used to reduce the quantity and pathologic functioning of inflammatory infiltrating cells in the skin.\r"

  ".W": "Eosinophils are frequently observed in cutaneous inflammation, but little is known of their significance in the pathophysiology of cutaneous disease. Recent studies of the structure, content, and activities of the eosinophil have shown that it has potent toxic proteins with the potential to mediate tissue damage. Furthermore, immunofluorescent localization of eosinophil granule proteins has shown that eosinophils disrupt in tissue and deposit toxic granule proteins. The deposition of granule proteins in several diseases is vastly out proportion to the number of identifiable cells and indicates that eosinophil involvement in cutaneous disease cannot be judged by the number of intact eosinophils in the tissue. Specifically, deposition of eosinophil granule proteins outside of eosinophils has been observed in eczematous lichenified disorders with elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E, in urticarial and angioedematous disorders, and in bullous diseases. The structural, compositional, and functional characteristics of eosinophils are reviewed, and evidence of eosinophil degranulation in cutaneous diseases is presented. Mechanisms whereby eosinophil degranulation may mediate pathophysiologic effects are also discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91302633\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of cetirizine (C), a new generation, nonsedative, H1-antihistamine drug, were studied on human isolated bronchi. C is a potent antagonist of the bronchial muscle contraction induced by histamine, irrespective of whether C is administered by cumulative addition or prophylactically. In the former case, this effect of C was significant at a concentration of 3 X 10(-8) mol/L and was maximal at a concentration of 10(-5) mol/L. The -log of concentration of C causing 50% of the maximal effect induced was 7.30 +/- 0.05 (n = 6), and the effect produced was not significantly modified by bronchial epithelium removal. When C was administered prophylactically, the concentration-response curves to histamine were displaced to the right, but the reduction of maximum histamine response suggests a noncompetitive type of antagonism. C is devoid of notable anticholinergic effects. At concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-7) mol/L, C proved capable of enhancing the relaxant effect produced by salbutamol (10(-7) to 3 X 10(-7) mol/L) on human isolated bronchi that had been contracted by either histamine or acetylcholine (ACh). The synergy appeared to be additive or potentiating, depending on salbutamol (SAL) concentrations. Under similar conditions, mepyramine does not potentiate the effects of SAL against histamine. Finally, at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L, C reduced the functional antagonism observed between SAL and ACh, as can be observed by the increase, in the presence of C, of the maximal relaxant effect of SAL on contractions produced by 10(-3) mol/L of ACh. We may, therefore, conclude that C appears to be a specific antihistamine on human isolated bronchi and that it appears to potentiate the bronchodilator effect of SAL on this preparation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate (Ins[1,4,5]P3) mass, calcium mobilization, and the release of granule enzymes was studied on guinea pig peritoneal eosinophils (EOSs). PAF evoked a concentration-dependent accumulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 with a drug concentration that elicits 50% of the maximum attainable response (EC50) of 10 nmol/L; the production of this second messenger was maximal at 1 mumol/L of PAF. Kinetic analysis of PAF (1 mumol/L)-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation demonstrated it to be transient with a 3.8-fold increase over resting levels observed at 5 seconds. Thereafter, the level of Ins(1,4,5)P3 declined, returning to vehicle-treated levels 60 seconds after PAF challenge. Lyso-PAF, the inactive precursor and metabolite of PAF, was inactive at all concentrations examined. PAF also induced a rapid, concentration-dependent (EC50, 12 nmol/L) rise in the cytosolic-free calcium concentration ([Ca++]i) in fura 2-AM-loaded EOSs that was transient, peaking after the maximum increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 mass was observed. A highly significant positive correlation was found between the peak increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the peak rise in [Ca++]i. Functionally, PAF evoked a concentration-dependent release of granule constituents from both the small (arylsulfatase B; EC50, 3 nmol/L) and specific (EOS peroxidase; EC50, 2.7 nmol/L) granules that lagged, temporally, behind both Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation and the rise in [Ca++]i. Both the biochemical and functional effects of PAF examined in this study were antagonized by WEB 2086 (300 nmol/L), a selective PAF receptor-blocking drug. It is concluded that stimulus (PAF)-response coupling in guinea pig peritoneal EOSs may involve the receptor-mediated formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and subsequent release of intracellularly stored Ca++. This sequence of events may link PAF receptor activation to Ca(++)-dependent cellular responses, such as degranulation.\r"

  ".W": "From 1981 to 1987, 26 outbreaks of asthma have occurred in the city of Barcelona, Spain, affecting a total of 687 subjects and causing 1155 emergency room admissions. Assays of urban aerosols collected with high-volume samplers between October 1986 and May 1989 have indicated that soybean dust originating from harbor activities (and not traffic or industrial pollution) is the causal agent for these epidemics. Soybean particulates in the filters have been characterized from the composition of the alcohol fraction, namely, campesterol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, n-triacontan-1-ol, and n-dotriacontan-1-ol, constituting a series of aerosol components correlated with the epidemiologic data. This result has also been confirmed by immunochemical assay of specific soybean allergens. The concentration of these sterols in the air corresponds to a 24-hour average level of soybean dust in the order of 25 micrograms/m3 on epidemic days. These results suggest the advisability of monitoring soybean dust in air particulates of populated areas surrounding soybean storage or processing plants. The techniques presented here afford a simple way for the recognition of soybean dust in aerosols containing high concentrations of organic pollutants of traffic or industrial origin.\r"

In the first study, three groups of subjects participated: one group with no treatment (N = 19), one group with 10 months of IT, reaching maintenance at 2 micrograms of Amb a I (antigen E) (N = 15), and one group with 22 months of IT, reaching maintenance at 24 micrograms of Amb a I (N = 10). The percent of EOSs in nasal lavages performed during December before and 24 hours after nasal challenge with ragweed extract was determined. No significant difference between groups existed before challenge. The no treatment group demonstrated a significant increase in the percent of EOSs from 26% to 69.5% (p less than 0.008), whereas the treated groups demonstrated no significant change. In the second study, 45 patients were divided into four groups based on maintenance dose in micrograms of Amb a I and duration of treatment: (1) no treatment (N = 15), (2) 1 year at 2 micrograms (N = 13), (3) 2 years at 2 micrograms (N = 11), and (4) 3 years at 24 micrograms (N = 9). Nasal mucosal brushings were done during the ragweed season. A significantly smaller percentage of EOSs in 3-year IT-treated individuals was obtained compared to the control group (18 versus 8.4; p less than 0.04). The smaller dose of IT, regardless of duration, did not reveal a reduction compared to that in the no-treatment group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To define better the sources of nasal secretion produced during rhinitis, nasal allergen challenges were performed on nine atopic subjects with seasonal rhinitis. A single dose of allergen was sprayed into one side of the nose, and nasal lavages were collected bilaterally for 7 hours. Nasal lavages were assayed for protein (total protein, albumin, lactoferrin, and lysozyme) and mediator (histamine and prostaglandin D2) content. Protein concentrations increased and remained elevated above baseline levels in both ipsilateral and contralateral secretions for up to 3 hours after allergen challenge. The proportion of albumin relative to total protein (the albumin percent) increased on the ipsilateral side, whereas the relative proportions of lactoferrin and lysozyme (the lactoferrin percent and lysozyme percent) increased on the contralateral side. Prostaglandin D2, but not histamine, increased selectively on the ipsilateral side. These data suggest that the ipsilateral protein secretory response is due to allergen-induced mast cell mediator release causing increased vascular permeability, whereas the contralateral protein secretory response is primarily a reflex-induced glandular secretion.\r"

The maintenance dose was defined as that dose effective in grass-pollen IT in previous experiments. The same equipotent maintenance dose was administered for all pollen species. Symptom-medication scores during the pollen season and nasal challenge with orchard grass-pollen grains demonstrated that grass pollen-allergic patients had a significantly improved efficacy by comparison to placebo treatment, whereas polysensitized patients had a nonsignificant improvement.

Ninety-four percent of CBD cases (16/17) had abnormal blood LTT results, and all 18 beryllium-exposed control subjects had normal blood LTT results. Split samples for 10 beryllium disease cases and eight control subjects demonstrated that the blood LTT was reproducible between two separate laboratories. The LTT was equally sensitive with 10% and 20% serum in the culture medium. We conclude that an abnormal blood LTT can be used to diagnose CBD in patients with compatible lung pathology.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the study was to describe the bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine and exercise in a randomly selected group of 527 children and adolescents from Copenhagen, aged between 7 to 16 years. The distribution of the bronchial responsiveness was described as (1) the provoking concentration that causes a 20% reduction in FEV1 (2) the dose-response slope (DRS), that is, the linear slope of the dose-response curve, and (3) reduction in FEV1 after 6 minutes of exercise on a treadmill. The distribution of the concentration that causes a 20% reduction in FEV1 in the responsive range was not significantly different from a unimodal distribution, although the findings were skewed toward the less responsive end of the range (p greater than 0.05). The subjects with asthma represented a subgroup within the responsive distribution tail rather than a separate distribution peak. In asymptomatic individuals, the values of DRS were distributed symmetrically on a logarithmic scale. The deviation from normal was such that the standard deviation only slightly underestimated the \"normal\" range. The distribution of the bronchial response to exercise was found to be significantly different from a normal distribution. However, a significant relationship was found between the bronchial response to inhaled histamine and exercise (p less than 0.0001). We conclude that there is a log-normal distribution of the bronchial response to inhaled histamine in a random sample of children and adolescents.\r"

  ".W": "Immunohistochemical procedures were performed to ascertain Fel d I antigen (Ag) distribution in cat fur and skin biopsy specimens and to analyze Fel d I allergen concentrations in fur. One hundred strands of fur and 24 skin biopsy specimens (6 by 4 by 3 mm) from shaved areas were collected from 11 different cats. Freshly depilated hairs were immunostained by free-floating monoclonal anti-Fel d I, avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex, and either processed for scanning electron microscopic examination or mounted on glass slides for computer-assisted densitometric analysis (SAMBA system). Skin biopsy specimens were promptly frozen and sectioned just before the immunohistochemical processing. Densitometric analysis of fur demonstrated that immunoprecipitate concentrations were tenfold higher at the root than at the tip. However, this finding may be explained by decrease of the thickness of the hair cortex that varied in similar proportions. The Ag accumulated on the strand surface but may focally penetrate into the medulla through the scale-like cortical interstices. In skin biopsy specimens, Fel d I Ag was found in epithelial squamous cells, within the epidermis and hair follicles, on the surface of the epidermis and hair follicles, and in sebaceous gland cells. These data suggest that Fel d I Ag is produced by sebaceous cells and, to a lesser extent, by basal squamous epithelial cells and that it is stored mainly on the surface of the epidermis and fur.\r"

This study was performed to elucidate determinants of Hdm sensitization in children living in the area. In a case-control study, 53 Hdm-sensitized children (cases), a group of non-Hdm-sensitized atopic children (N = 54), and a group of nonallergic neighborhood children (N = 53) were included. Mattress dust was analyzed with ELISA for content of Hdm allergens. Indoor humidity and temperature were measured, and questionnaire data were collected. Asthma was significantly more common in the Hdm-sensitized group than in the atopic control group. Hdm allergens were found in 40%, 19%, and 23% of the dust samples of the case group, atopic group, and neighborhood control groups, respectively. Only 15% of the dust samples of the Hdm-sensitized children contained Hdm allergens above the recommended threshold levels of sensitization of 2000 ng/gm of dust. Inadequate ventilation, which partly appeared to be a consequence of energy saving, appeared to be a risk factor for Hdm sensitization. This result may apply also to other temperate regions and suggests that the problem is preventable.\r"

These patients, most of whom were treated with intramuscular gamma globulin and long-term oral antibiotics, had very few pneumonias after diagnosis. The patients with XLA had 0.10 pneumonias per treatment year, and the patients with CVID had 0.18 pneumonias per treatment year. Seven of the 10 patients with XLA had normal chest x-ray films 8 to 15 years after diagnosis, and none had bronchiectasis. Pulmonary disease was more common and more severe in the group with CVID, but five patients in this group also had normal chest x-ray films after long follow-up. In the entire group of 22 patients, nine of the 10 patients with abnormal chest x-ray films on most recent evaluation already had pulmonary disease at the initial visit (p = 0.00002). These studies indicate that the best predictors of good pulmonary function in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are early diagnosis and good compliance with gamma globulin replacement therapy and oral antibiotics.\r"

Computerized analysis of the 24-hour recall data showed that there were few differences in nutrient intake between the Southeast Asian groups, except that the Cambodian group consumed significantly less fat, riboflavin, vitamin D, and calcium than the Vietnamese group. However, there were a number of differences between the nutrient intakes of the Southeast Asian groups and those of the non-Southeast Asian group. These included significantly lower intakes of fat, riboflavin, folate, vitamins D and E, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium and significantly higher intakes of thiamin, niacin, sodium, and selenium. These findings suggest that low-income Southeast Asian pregnant women have some good dietary habits that dietitians need to reinforce and other dietary habits that need improvement.\r"

A shopping mall intercept survey, which was administered by a marketing research firm, assessed consumer preferences for 12 label alternatives produced on Campbell's soup cans to portray nutrition information realistically; 252 of 258 respondents completed the computer interactive interview. Consumers significantly preferred the bar graph format to the bar graph/nutrient density and traditional label formats. Consumers considered the bar graph/nutrient density format to be as useful as the traditional label format. There was a highly significant difference among the three levels of information load; the most information load was preferred regardless of nutrient importance. Consumers significantly preferred nutrition information stated in absolute numbers and percentages vs in absolute numbers only in traditional, or in percentages only expressions. There was a significant difference between consumer preferences for the two types of information order. The findings indicate that consumers clearly preferred the nutrition label that displayed all nutrient values using a bar graph format, offered the most information load, and expressed nutrient values using both absolute numbers and percentages. Consumers also preferred nutrition information rearranged in an order that grouped nutrients that should be consumed in adequate amounts on the top, calories in the middle, and nutrients that should be consumed in lesser amounts on the bottom of the label.\r"

Nutrition labeling regulations were announced in 1973 and have been periodically amended since then. In response to requests from consumers and health care professionals for revision of the labeling system, the Food and Drug Administration initiated a three-phase plan for reform of nutrition labeling in 1990. President Bush signed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act in November 1990. Literature analysis revealed that only nine studies with an experimental design have focused on nutrition labeling since 1971. Four were conducted before 1975, which was the year that nutrition labeling was officially implemented, two were conducted in 1980, and three were conducted after 1986. Only two of the nine studies supported the traditional label format mandated by the Code of Federal Regulations, and one study partially supported it. Four of the nine studies that evaluated graphic presentations of nutrition information found that consumer comprehension of nutrition information was improved with a graphic format for nutrition labeling: three studies supported the use of bar graphs and one study supported the use of a pie chart. Full disclosure (ie, complete nutrient and ingredient labeling) was preferred by consumers in two of the three studies that examined this variable. The third study supported three types of information disclosure dependent upon socioeconomic class. In those studies that tested graphics, a bar graph format was significantly preferred and showed better consumer comprehension than the traditional format.\r"

Various kinds of soy protein, including soy flour, soy-protein concentrate, and isolated soy protein, are currently used in human foods. Soy proteins are used in infant formulas and enteral nutrition products, as ingredients in meat products, and as protein supplements. Although it is a plant protein, the protein quality of soy protein is excellent. Soy fiber is used in enteral nutrition products and some bakery goods. Research shows that soy fiber provides the important health benefits usually associated with dietary fiber, including improved laxation and cholesterol-lowering ability. This review provides background information on soy protein and soy fiber and their use in human foods.\r"

In human beings, substitution of soy protein for dietary animal protein or addition of soy protein to the diet lowers total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. Reductions of 20% or more have been obtained with diets high in protein (about 20% of total energy) and relatively low in fat. Triglycerides are also decreased, particularly in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia, but soy-protein diets appear to have little effect on high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Responses are similar in men and women, but may be greater in younger than in older subjects. The hypocholesterolemic effect is thought to be mainly attributable to the protein itself rather than to nonprotein components of soy-protein preparations. The mechanism of action is not known, and it may not be possible to explain the observed effects in human beings and in experimental animal models by the same mechanism. Although the hypocholesterolemic response to dietary soy protein has been observed by a number of European research groups, substitution of soy protein for animal protein in North American diets has generally had little effect, for reasons that are still not clear.\r"

Findings show that well-processed soy-protein isolates and soy-protein concentrates can serve as the major, or even sole, source of protein intake and that their protein value is essentially equivalent to that of food proteins of animal origin. The importance of the sulfur amino acid content of soy protein for practical human nutrition is also examined from nitrogen-balance data. Under conditions of an anticipated normal usage of soy protein, methionine supplementation is not only unnecessary but may even be undesirable for young children and adults. However, for newborns, the data suggest that modest supplementation of soy-based formulas with methionine may be beneficial. Soy proteins have also been found to be of good quality to include in hypocaloric diets for weight reduction in obese subjects. Finally, the data indicate that soy proteins are well-tolerated and of good acceptability.\r"

Although most of what is produced is used as animal feed, soy-protein products (eg, soy-protein flour, concentrates, and isolates) are used extensively by the food industry, primarily for their functional characteristics, such as emulsification. During the past decade, however, there has been a marked increase in the use of both traditional soyfoods, such as tofu and soymilk, and second-generation soyfoods, products which generally simulate familiar American dishes. Recently, attention has focused on the possible role of soybean consumption in reducing cancer risk. Soybeans contain, in relatively high concentrations, several compounds with demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity. Two of these compounds--protease inhibitors and phytic acid--have traditionally been viewed as antinutrients. The scientific community has begun to appreciate the potential importance of nonnutritive dietary compounds (phytochemicals) in foods such as soybeans. Dietitians need to become more aware of the phytochemical content of foods and the possible effect of phytochemicals on health and disease.\r"

  ".W": "Although coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of death and disability in old age, the relationship of serum cholesterol level to risk of coronary heart disease in old age is controversial. Data for 2,388 white persons aged 65-74 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) were examined to determine the relationship of serum cholesterol level to coronary heart disease incidence and whether activity level would modify this relationship. While there was no overall relationship between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease risk in either men or women, the relationship between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease differed within activity groups. For persons who were more active, serum cholesterol level was associated with a graded increase in risk of coronary heart disease, from 1.3 (95% CI 0.7, 2.3) in those with serum cholesterol level of 4.7-5.1 to 1.7 in those with serum cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or more (95% CI 1.0, 2.7), when compared with those with serum cholesterol level below 4.7. For the least active persons, all levels of cholesterol were associated with a significant inverse relative risk, including cholesterol of 6.2 mmol/L or more (Relative risk = 0.4 (95% CI 0.2, 0.7]. These data suggest that factors such as activity level may modify the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association in old age. The serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association in more active older persons resembles that seen in younger populations, whereas the association in less active persons is that of serum cholesterol level and risk of cancer or death. The modification of the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association by activity level may have implications for appropriate clinical management as well as appropriate design of research studies of this association.\r"

DESIGN: A two-phase design with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the screening phase and the Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMS) in the diagnostic phase. SETTING: Community survey including subjects in residential care. SUBJECTS: All (n = 1,259) inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands, aged 85 years and over on December 1, 1986. First phase participation rate was 71% (17% dropout due to death); second phase participation rate was 82%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: DSM-III diagnosis of dementia without further specification of the etiology of the dementia. RESULTS: An overall prevalence rate of 23% (95% C.I.: 19%-26%) was found. This included 12% mild dementia, 7% moderate and 4% severe dementia. The prevalence rate was higher among women (24%) than among men (18%). It increased with age from 19% (95% C.I.: 16%-22%) in the group of 85-89 years to 32% (95% C.I.: 26%-39%) in the group of 90-94 years to 41% (95% C.I.: 25%-58%) in the 95+ group. CONCLUSION: A fifth of the 85+ and a third of the 90+ population suffer from dementia with an indication that half of the 95+ population is affected. With the expected steep rise in the number of the oldest old, dementia will stay a major health problem in the near future.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of diagnosis and documentation of acute confusional states (ACS) in the medical records of patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: The diagnosis of ACS in two prospective clinical studies was compared to its diagnosis in the medical records of the same patients on the same hospitalization. In order to determine if the simultaneous prospective study influences the diagnostic and documentary practices evidenced in the medical records, a further comparison was done by reviewing medical records of two series of patients seen some years prior to the prospective studies. SETTING: Patients with femoral neck fractures treated at a department of orthopedic surgery in a university hospital and one retrospective control sample from a department of general surgery in a county hospital. SUBJECTS: Two prospective samples of patients 65 years and older treated for femoral neck fractures (n = 111 and n = 57, respectively) and two earlier retrospective samples (n = 66 and n = 68, respectively). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All comparisons showed that both physicians and nurses diagnosed ACS unsatisfactorily and documented the patients' mental status poorly. The analysis of the two retrospective medical record control samples gave the same results. Neither the physicians nor the nurses used any kind of diagnostic instrument to detect cognitive disorders in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: ACS is a common and severe complication in elderly people treated for femoral neck fractures. Acute confusional states have, by definition, one or more causes that can often be identified and treated. Poor assessment and documentation is a threat to the patients as a correct diagnosis of ACS is a prerequisite for further assessment of its underlying causes and the consequent necessary medical and nursing care.\r"

Cases and controls were selected from males age 65 years and older residing in the 120-bed McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center Nursing Home Care Unit over a 5-day interval. Historical data and serum free testosterone (fTe) were available on 17 subjects with MTHF and 61 controls. When groups were compared for differences in age, race, alcohol abuse, cigarette abuse, and diseases or drugs that may be associated with MTHF, only race was significantly different. Although 25.6% of residents were black, 100% of MTHF subjects were white (P = 0.004). Hypogonadism was defined as a random fTe less than 9 pg/mL (normal 9 to 46 pg/mL) and was found in 21 subjects (26.9%). Of cases with a MTHF, 58.8% were hypogonadal compared with only 18.0% of controls. Utilizing logistic regression, a highly significant association was found between hypogonadism and MTHF (P = 0.008), and using the odds ratio, subjects with hypogonadism were 6.5 times more likely to have a MTHF (95% CI 2.0 to 20.6). To adjust for race, the odds ratio was repeated excluding black subjects, and the results remained highly significant (4.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 16.2). We conclude that hypogonadal elderly white men may be at increased risk for MTHF.\r"

We retrospectively studied utilization rates of intensive care (IC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in admissions to a university hospital over 1 year (n = 9,998), to test whether these treatments are used more selectively for elderly patients. Overall utilization rates did not vary by age. However, among 524 terminal admissions, IC was used for 63% of patients age 35-74 but for only 50% of patients 75 and older (P less than 0.01). Among elderly patients, nursing home residence, diagnosis of advanced malignancy, severe chronic illness, and older age were independent predictors of withholding IC prior to death. Despite more selective use, survival rates were lower for elderly than for younger patients receiving IC (88% vs 78%, P less than 0.001). CPR showed similar but non-significant trends. Intensive care is being used less frequently prior to death for elderly patients, based on diagnosis and functional status as well as chronologic age.\r"

SUBJECTS: Convenience sample of 157 community-living women, aged 55 to 90 years, after completion of a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. METHODS: Eighty-two subjects were randomly assigned to the exercise protocol (with a 34% attrition rate). Pelvic muscle exercises were taught and monitored for 6 months. Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride was given to the other group in a dose of 50 mg a day, increasing to 50 mg twice a day. MAIN RESULTS: Treatment outcomes (subjective improvement, self recorded frequency of wetting) were equally satisfactory in both groups. The response to exercises was as good in 5 months as in 6. It was also as good when the minimum recommended number of exercises per day was 80 as when it was 125. CONCLUSIONS: Among those completing the protocol, pelvic exercises were beneficial in reducing stress incontinence, and the benefit was comparable to that produced by phenylpropanolamine.\r"

  ".W": "Newly enacted Federal regulations have focused increasing attention on the use of psychoactive drugs and on the treatment of disruptive behavior in the nursing home. To study the interaction between resident behavior and staff distress in nursing homes, we measured the frequency of seven types of behavior problems among 346 residents of intermediate care facilities who were receiving some form of psychoactive medication. Nurses were interviewed on two shifts to determine their perception of the frequency and severity of each behavior in each patient as well as the level of distress it caused among caregivers. The most common behavior problems noted were agitation (42%), withdrawal (33%), and noisiness (27%). Only half of the reported instances of behavior disorders were considered distressful by nursing home staff. While physical abuse caused distress 92% of the time and verbal abuse 90% of the time, wandering was seen as distressful to staff only 50% of the time. Nearly a third of \"wandering\" patients were restrained; they produced less distress than non-restrained wanderers. There was substantial disagreement, ranging from 6% to 22% for individual residents, over the presence of distress-causing behavior, although day and evening nursing shifts rated the frequencies of behavior and the degrees of distress equally on average. Residents with higher cognitive function were less likely to cause distress for all behaviors, except for verbal abuse where the reverse was true. Age and dependency in activities of daily living were not associated with problematic behavior or staff distress. These findings indicate that the existence of \"problematic\" behaviors in a given resident is often perceived differently by different staff, and its impact on staff also differs widely.\r"

  ".W": "Despite increases in geriatrics training at all levels of medical education, there is a nationwide shortage of geriatrics faculty. This shortage may be due in part to demands for clinical responsibilities that preclude adequate time for teaching and research. To learn about the professional activities of geriatrics faculty, we conducted a national survey of a 50% sample of all medical schools and their affiliated residency programs that focused on physician and non-physician geriatrics faculty in internal medicine, family practice, psychiatry, neurology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. Although we found minor differences across specialties, in general, approximately one-third of physician faculty time is spent in teaching, the majority of which is clinical teaching. Less than 15% of physician faculty time is spent in research, and fewer than 10% of physician geriatrics faculty devote over half of their time to research. The percentage of time that non-physician faculty (other than \"Research Only\" faculty) spend in research is only slightly higher. These findings suggest that efforts to increase geriatrics education at all levels and promote research advances will be limited unless geriatricians devote substantially more of their time to these responsibilities.\r"

Twelve-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats weighed approximately three times more than did 2-month-old rats of the same strain (761 +/- 61 g vs 223 +/- 8 g, p less than .001). Basal glycerol release was increased in the adipocytes of the 12-month-old rats (128 +/- 8 nmol/10(5) cells/L compared to the 2-month-old rats 51 +/- 3 nmol/10(5) cells/L). However, the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate glycerol release above basal was markedly decreased in the older and fatter Sprague-Dawley rats (178 +/- 15 nmol/10(5) cells/L vs 482 +/- 20 nmol/10(5) cells/L, p less than .001), and significant correlation coefficients between isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol release and both total body (r = .76, p less than .001) and fat pad (r = .83, p less than .001) weight were seen in Sprague-Dawley rats. Total body weights of 2-month (188 +/- 16 g), 12-month (393 +/- 15 g), and 27-month-old (402 +/- 36 g) Fischer 344 rats were less disparate. Isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol release was similar in the three groups of Fischer 344 rats, and there was no correlation between either total body or fat pad weight and lipolysis in these rats.\r"

In order to address this issue, we used two highly specific beta receptor ligands with lymphocytes from healthy aged (range: 51-90 years) and young (19-39 years) subjects in two separate studies. Because depression can reduce Bmax, potential aged subjects were excluded if they had high scores on tests for depression. Bmax was higher in the aged group of each study (33% higher in the first, p less than .01, and 72.5% in the second, p less than .02); the results were similar in both studies. Antagonist affinity did not differ between young and aged groups in either study. We suggest that some of the discrepancies in the literature could be due to differences in age ranges used or to inclusion of depressed subjects in prior studies.\r"

Levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) were determined by HPLC-EC. Compared with values from 6- and 18-mo rats, mean adrenal weight, DA and NE content and concentration, and E content were increased in the 30-mo rats; E concentration was not. The ratio of E:NE declined in the 30-mo group. Germ-free status and dietary restriction had little effect in modulating these age-related changes. Reanalysis of adrenal weights of 30-mo rats revealed two clear subgroups, hyperplastic and non-hyperplastic; the data from hyperplastic adrenals revealed an exaggerated form of the \"aged\" CA profile, whereas data from the nonhyperplastic adrenals more closely resembled that of younger rats. Thus, aging in LWR is associated with adrenal hyperplasia and a tendency toward elevated adrenomedullary stores of DA and NE, while E stores are maintained near levels found in young rats.\r"

Because dietary restriction (DR) of rodents has been shown to extend maximum life span, delay the onset of tumors, and improve many immunologic parameters in aged animals, we tested the effect of such a regimen on the immune response to the influenza virus. We report that DR significantly inhibited the age-related decline in antigen presentation and T-cell proliferation. It also reduced the decline in antibody production to the virus. This is the first demonstration of improved immunity to an actual infectious agent resulting from DR. The improvement appears to be on a number of levels and to reflect more than one operative mechanism.\r"

Labeling of the phagocytic cells with colloidal carbon showed that dividing cells in the peritoneal cavity of experimental mice are resident macrophages. Also shown was an increase in number of hyperdiploid metaphases in hyperimmune, older mice but not in the young ones. Statistical analysis showed these differences to be significant. G-banding of hyperdiploid cells of hyperimmune older mice showed trisomy of chromosome 15 in several metaphases analyzed. The absence of hyperdiploid metaphases in the bone marrow cells of hyperimmune mice and in exudate macrophages of mice that received the irritant thioglycollic acid suggests that hyperdiploidy occurs in resident macrophages in the peritoneal cavity but not in their precursors in the bone marrow. These results raise some questions such as, hyperimmune older mice resident macrophages being prone to hyperdiploidy and trisomy of chromosome 15.\r"

  ".W": "During the aging process modified functions of hypothalamic factors may cause sexually dimorphic changes in pituitary somatotropes and lactotropes. To test this hypothesis, pituitary tissue from young adult (4 months) and old (20-22 months) male and female rats was labeled immunocytochemically for growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). The total amount of immunoreactive material as well as the total area and number of immunoreactive structures were evaluated. With increasing age the intracellular GH content was moderately increased in male and decreased in female rats. An age-dependent PRL increase, due both to increased cell number and intracellular hormone content, was present only in female rats. The amount of GH- and PRL-immunoreactive material, distributed into classes of increasing density, differed both between sex and age groups. Our results indicate that the aging process of the somatotrope and lactotrope cell populations in rats appears to be different in the two sexes.\r"

Both modes of microscopy revealed substantial differences between the various age groups. Water content, as well as collagen concentration, decreased significantly from the 2-mo to the 12- or 36- mo groups. The concentration of the reducible crosslinks, associated with less mature tissue, was significantly greater in the younger tissues relative to the aged tissues. The nonreducible crosslink increased with maturation of the collagen in the 36-mo rabbits. Collagen synthesis rates fell from a highest value in the 2-mo group to the lowest in the 36-mo group.\r"

If this age effect on beta-ARs also applies to the pancreatic B-cell, it would result in relatively unopposed alpha-adrenergic inhibition of insulin secretion with adrenergic stimulation during stress states. This study compared insulin secretory responses to beta-AR stimulation (multiple IV doses of isoproterenol) with cardiac and circulating mononuclear lymphocyte (MNL) beta-AR responses in 9 healthy, non-obese young subjects, and 9 healthy, non-obese old subjects. We found no age-related decrease in the relationship between isoproterenol dose and insulin response. In contrast, the old subjects had significantly reduced heart rate responses to isoproterenol and generally lower MNL beta-AR function. We conclude that pancreatic B-cell beta-AR mediated function is not impaired in the elderly, suggesting that heterogeneity of tissue beta-AR mediated function exists in this population. Diminished pancreatic islet beta-AR mediated function does not appear to be a mechanism that predisposes healthy older individuals to the development of stress hyperglycemia.\r"

Evaluations included a detailed history, physical examination, performance-oriented mobility assessment, and laboratory studies. Primary causes including stroke, parkinsonism, blindness, drug-related hypotension, and arthritis were established for the most recent fall in 51 (73%) fallers. Eighteen fallers (26%) had multiple conditions that could not be prioritized for their contribution to the fall. Fallers were more often women, were functionally more impaired, and were taking more medications than nonfallers. Specific diseases did not distinguish fallers from nonfallers. Fallers of both sexes took more steps to turn 360 degrees, could not stand up from a chair without pushing off, had a higher prevalence of antidepressant use, and had impaired position sensation. These easily obtained clinical variables characterized nearly three-quarters of ambulatory elderly nursing home residents with a history of recurrent falls.\r"

One hundred ambulatory and independent volunteers (aged 62-96) were subjected to five types of balance tests: (a) spontaneous postural sway, (b) induced anterior-posterior sway, (c) induced medial-lateral sway, (d) one-leg stance, and (e) a clinical balance assessment scale. Pseudorandom platform motions were used in the induced-sway tests. The subjects were classified into both \"faller\"/\"nonfaller\" and \"fear\"/\"no-fear\" categories, to allow the influence of fear of falling and falling history to be separated in the analyses. Subjects who expressed a fear of falling were found to exhibit significantly poorer performance in blindfolded spontaneous-sway tests and in eyes-open, one-leg stance tests. The clinical scale was the only balance measure that showed a significant association with retrospective, self-reported falling history. We could not ascertain whether the fear of falling affected balance-test performance in an artifactual manner, or whether the fear and poorer performance were related to a true deterioration in postural control. Until this issue can be resolved, balance-test performance should be interpreted with caution when testing apprehensive individuals. Furthermore, studies of postural control and falling should allow for the potentially confounding influence of fear of falling.\r"

From the 3,841 households originally sampled, 810 individuals were selected for clinical psychiatric evaluation. Forty-one individuals were given a provisional diagnosis and referred to Stage 3 for differential diagnosis, with 32 individuals completing this evaluation. Thorough clinical evaluation of these cases resulted in an overall prevalence of dementia of 4.5% in those 65 years of age and older. The prevalence of specific dementing disorders was Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2.0%), Multi-Infarct Dementia (MID) (2.0%) and Mixed Dementia (MD) (0.5%). Prevalence increased with age for all dementias: Non-Whites had higher rates of dementia than Whites; females had higher rates of AD while males had higher rates of MID; and the prevalence of AD increased with increasing education, whereas the prevalence of MID decreased with increased education. Although this study includes only a small number of cases, necessitating some caution in interpreting the results, these figures do represent an estimate of the prevalence of severe dementing disorders and provide a basis for further community study.\r"

The 134-patient sample was given a comprehensive geriatric assessment which included the KPS, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, and other psychosocial and sensory tests. The KPS, ADL, and IADL were significantly correlated with each other, and the KPS showed the strongest associations with other functional measures. The KPS was also highly predictive of outcomes, performing better or equally well as the ADL and IADL. The KPS designation of high- and low-risk groups resulted in statistically significant score differences between groups in all but one assessment area, demonstrating better ability to discriminate than either the ADL or IADL. Thus, the KPS was shown to serve as an effective proxy score for a patient's health and functional status. It also was a significant predictor of hospitalizations, survival time, community residence, and institutionalization. Finally, the KPS was shown to adequately distinguish risk groups to aid in the targeting of services to ambulatory geriatric patients.\r"

These increases may be attributable to factors other than the change of method, however, including the change in time from 1975 to 1982 and the change from one state to three communities. The sex differences suggest that the added years of life that women have enjoyed over men are neither solely added years of vigor nor solely added years of disability, but added years with the same mix of independence/dependence that the shorter-lived males experience. The age patterns suggest that at any age the future presents a relatively constant expectation of the total duration of dependency, and concordantly, as one ages, there is a relatively uniform decrease in the proportion of active life to remaining years.\r"

Pulse increases in response to this hypotensive stress were markedly reduced in the elderly, but renin, vasopressin, and norepinephrine responses were not different between young and old.

A subsequent speeded recognition test required the participants to distinguish the learned facts from foils constructed by recombining the same concepts. On this recognition test, both groups showed an increase in response time and errors as the fan level of the probe increased. For older adults these effects were larger, however, indicating an age-related increase in interference effects in retrieval. These results are consistent with a theoretical framework (Hasher & Zacks, 1988) which proposes an age-related decline in the ability to screen irrelevant information out of working memory. The findings also have implications for age differences in discourse processing and other cognitive tasks that crucially depend on the timely and accurate retrieval of stored information.\r"

There were no differences between students and elders on any of the dependent measures. However, differences were found between elders and patients on each measure, and a discriminant function correctly classified the two groups with 93.3% accuracy. Subsequent discriminant analysis found patients could be correctly classified into diagnostic subgroups, i.e., dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and Korsakoff's disease (KD) with 80.8% accuracy. The model holds promise as a guide for clinicians who are asked to make differential diagnoses of memory-impaired individuals.\r"

The group with left temporal slow activity was significantly deficient on measures of memory savings and memory losses derived from the Logical Memory (Story Recall) Test in the Wechsler Memory Scale--Revised. There were no significant differences between these two groups on the non-memory cognitive tasks. This predominant verbal recent memory deficit profile is reasonably similar to the neuropsychological deficit profile of very mildly demented Alzheimer patients. Because left temporal slow EEG activity is also the predominant EEG abnormality in mild Alzheimer patients, a prospective study should be done to determine if this abnormality in non-demented elderly subjects is most often a preclinical sign of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

When irradiated conditioned young animals were used as recipients of antigen-challenged spleen cells from nonconditioned mice they were found to support a greater immune response than nonconditioned recipients. Similarly, cells from conditioned young mice gave a greater immune response in naive recipients than did cells from nonconditioned mice. Only when cells from conditioned young mice rather than conditioned \"aged\" mice were studied in irradiated conditioned young recipients was immunosuppression observed. These data are most consistent with a specific host cell:environment interaction being responsible for the conditioned immunosuppression observed in young mice. A deficit in both cells/environment apparently occurs during aging. At least one of these deficiencies seems related to loss of a suppressor T-cell population with age in conditioned mice.\r"

Thereafter, the same volunteers carried out a backward and forward masking task adapted to minimize noncognitive age-related influences: target and mask duration were individually adjusted to control for reduced eye transmissiveness. Attention was assessed with the electrooculogram; a dependent variable insensitive to sporadic decreases of attention was selected. Test-retest stability in the elderly after 2-4 weeks was r = .97 in backward and r = .86 in forward masking. As Alzheimer's disease mainly affects the cortex, backward masking, which is primarily cortical, may be useful to assess aspects of cognitive dysfunction.\r"

Young (n = 33; age range 20-36 years), middle-aged (n = 35; age range 40-55 years), and older (n = 32; age range 60-85 years) adults rated an extensive list of psychological attributes in terms of the degree of expected developmental increase across the adult life span (ages 20-90), the perceived controllability of these changes, their desirability, and their expected age-related timing. The findings indicate a substantial degree of similarity in young, middle-aged, and old adults' overall beliefs about controllability. The three adult age groups agreed in perceiving developmental changes in adulthood as fairly controllable, and with regard to their relative controllability (rank ordering of change-sensitive attributes). Changes expected to occur later in life were consensually perceived to be less desirable, and less desirable changes were perceived as less controllable. However, there were clear age-related differences involving both the age timing of expected changes and the age of respondents. A comparison between the three subject age groups revealed twofold differences: First, the relationship between desirability and perceived controllability was found to increase with subjects' age; second, Q-technique factor analysis showed that large subgroups of the young and the middle-aged adults, but not the old adults, tended to perceive psychological attributes associated with late onset decline as relatively lower in controllability.\r"

Elderly individuals are widely perceived to have less control over their environment than other adults. This lack of perceived control should have adverse affects on how they cope with stressful situations. However, most studies have shown that older adults differ little from younger adults in their approaches to coping with stress. This contradiction was investigated in a sample of 228 community-residing adults with a mean age of 42.16 (SD = 14.88). Path analysis revealed that appraisals and attributions do affect the use of coping strategies such as instrumental action and escapism in the expected directions, and age is negatively associated with perceived control. However, there was an independent and negative relationship between age and the reported use of escapist coping strategies, which mitigated the adverse effects of perceived lack of control. Neither age nor perceived controllability had direct effects on depression, but they had indirect effects through their influence on the use of coping strategies and perceived efficacy.\r"

A model of caregiving dynamics where the objective stressor, caregiver resources, and subjective appraisal of caregiving (operationalized as caregiving satisfaction and burden) were studied as they affected both positive affect and depression was tested. For spouses, caregiving satisfaction was not related to aspects of the stressor, but was a significant determinant of positive affect. Among adult children, high levels of caregiving behavior resulted in both greater caregiving satisfaction and burden. Burden, in turn, was related to depression in both groups but, among adult child caregivers, positive affect was not affected by caregiving satisfaction. Limited support was found for the hypothesis that the positive and negative aspects of caregiving contributed to analogous aspects of generalized psychological well-being but not to the opposite-valence outcomes.\r"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate an alternative view which suggests that particular kinds of stressful experiences (i.e., financial strain and the fear of crime) may actually promote greater isolation from others. The data reveal that chronic strain tends to promote distrust of others, and that distrust in turn leads to greater isolation from network members. However, the results further reveal that not all stressors are involved in this process. In particular, recent deaths are not related significantly to distrust or to social isolation. Finally, the data indicate that the process leading to less contact with others is more likely to involve older adults in lower social status positions. The impact of social isolation on depressive symptoms is also examined.\r"

The occurrence of cancer as a nonunderlying cause of death increased with age and was higher for treatable and slowly growing tumor types. These patterns persisted even if the cancer manifested changes in occurrence. Nonunderlying occurrences were highest in the 85 to 94 age group and were correlated with cancer survival. This suggests increased importance of cancer as a cause of death and a comorbid condition among oldest-old persons. The high rate of occurrence as an associated cause of death suggests that if life expectancy increases due to declines in circulatory and other chronic disease mortality, cancer could become the preeminent cause of death in the United States.\r"

We investigated the stimulation of T cell proliferation by synthetic peptides of sequences corresponding to the first polymorphic amino terminal domain of alpha- and beta-chains of self I-A molecules. Both unprimed and primed T cells responded to a number of peptides of alpha 1 and beta 1 domains of self I-Ad molecules. The response was dependent on the presentation of I-Ad peptides by syngeneic APC and was blocked by anti-class II MHC mAb. Upon further investigation it was observed that I-Ad peptides could inhibit the stimulation of Ag-specific MHC class II-restricted T cell hybridoma due to self presentation of peptides rather than to direct binding of free peptides to the TCR, further supporting their affinity/interaction with intact self MHC class II molecules. The peptide I-A beta d 62-78 showed high affinity toward intact self MHC II molecule as determined by the inhibition of Ag-specific T cell stimulation and yet was nonstimulatory for syngeneic T cells, therefore representing an MHC determinant that may have induced self tolerance. Thus we have shown that strong T cell proliferative responses can be generated in normal mice against the peptides derived from self MHC class II molecules and these cells are part of the normal T cell repertoire. Therefore complete tolerance toward potentially powerful immunodominant but cryptic determinants of self Ag may not be necessary to prevent autoimmune diseases.\r"

It has been suggested, recently, that autoreactive T cells that develop as a result of CsA treatment may result from inhibition of clonal deletion and could be responsible for the development of this disease. To test this hypothesis, TCR expression, as a measure of tolerance induction, was analyzed in a series of syngeneic radiation chimeras (inducible and noninducible for syngeneic GVHD), with and without CsA treatment. Clonal deletion, as assessed by anti-TCR V beta chain mAb, appeared to occur normally in strains of mice inducible for syngeneic GVHD. Conversely, animals in which T cells bearing self-reactive TCR could be detected, did not develop the disease. This discrepancy did not appear to be due to a generalized difference in the effects of CsA on the various strains of mice used, as the effects of the drug (i.e., decreased mitogen responsiveness, inhibition of thymocyte maturation, etc.) appeared similar in all strains tested. Therefore, the development of CsA-induced autoreactive T cells as assessed by V beta TCR expression showed strain variation that did not correlate with the induction of syngeneic GVHD and suggested that other mechanisms may be involved in the development of this autoimmune phenomenon.\r"

This increase in cell adhesion was not observed when a mutant T cell clone lacking TCR expression was utilized. However, upon stimulation by phorbol esters, both parent and mutant T cell clones exhibited a similar transient increase in adhesion to the three matrix proteins. The observed cell adhesion was extensively inhibited by antibodies to the integrin beta 1 subunit, indicating the involvement of VLA proteins. Despite changes in the adhesive properties, there was essentially no difference in the expression of VLA-1, -3, -4, -5, and -6 between resting and stimulated T cells. Together these results suggest that Ag stimulation transmits signals via the TCR complex resulting in a rapid, but transient, up-regulation of matrix protein binding by VLA proteins already present at the cell surface. Because the appropriate reagents that recognize individual mouse VLA proteins were not available, we used the human T cell line Jurkat to demonstrate that T cell binding to collagen, laminin, and fibronectin is mediated largely by VLA-2, VLA-6, and a combination of VLA-5 and VLA-4, respectively.\r"

Expression of PKC isozymes in thymocyte subsets (distinguished by the CD4 or CD8 Ag) was determined by message amplification phenotyping. The expression of mRNA for PKC-alpha, -beta, -epsilon, and -zeta, but not -gamma or -delta isozymes, was detected in all of the unstimulated thymocyte subpopulations analyzed. Thus no differences in the pattern of PKC isozyme expression were found that could be correlated with thymocyte phenotype. However, it was noted that the levels of PKC mRNA expression were affected by different stimuli in unfractionated thymocytes. Whereas mRNA levels of PKC-alpha and -beta were down-regulated by PMA and ionomycin treatment, no significant changes were seen in the levels of PKC-epsilon mRNA with these agents. PKC-epsilon mRNA decreased in thymocytes exposed to Con A similar to what has been reported for PKC-epsilon protein. PKC-zeta mRNA was also down-regulated by PMA or ionomycin, and the combination of both compounds caused a more rapid and drastic effect. Finally, PKC-delta mRNA expression was induced transiently in thymocytes only after exposure to PMA or Con A, and this induction was inhibited by ionomycin treatment. These results indicate that message levels of specific isoforms of PKC are uniquely regulated and suggest an additional level of control of PKC activity in activated lymphocytes.\r"

IL-2, which also activates IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation in T cells, was not able to induce NF-kappa B. TCR-mediated induction of NF-kappa B suggests a central role for this factor in activated T cells and also provides a mechanism for activation of latent HIV provirus during the normal immune response.\r"

To study the role of human CD4 in T cell activation we have used a murine T cell hybridoma, By 155.16, which produces IL-2 when stimulated by HLA-DR-bearing cells. Previously, we have shown that expression of human CD4 by this hybridoma enhances its ability to produce IL-2 in response to HLA-DR-bearing cells. Furthermore, deletion of the majority of the cytoplasmic domain renders CD4 less efficient at enhancing IL-2 production. We describe studies of a glycolipid-anchored mutant of the CD4 molecule, CD4PI. This mutant is composed of the entire extracellular domain of CD4 anchored to the outlet leaflet of the membrane via a covalent bond to glycosylphosphatidylinositol and, therefore, has no transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains. When expressed in By155.16, CD4PI shows no defect in its ability to increase intercellular adhesion but is unable to augment IL-2 production. These results clearly demonstrate that CD4 enhances T cell activation by mechanisms other than increasing intercellular adhesion.\r"

To investigate the potential for microbial SA to support Th cell-dependent, Ag-specific antibody responses, we have extended our studies to the murine system. BALB/c Th cell lines (TCL), specific for either the Mycoplasma arthritis-derived SA or the Staphylococcus aureus-derived toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) were generated. These TCL cells are SA-specific, functionally noncross-reactive, and utilize distinct TCR V beta gene families. Coculture of SA-reactive TCL cells and syngeneic B cells bearing the relevant SA results in B cell proliferation and polyclonal IgM and IgG production. In contrast, Ag-specific (SRBC-specific) antibody-forming cells are only generated in cultures that also contain SRBC. Thus, microbial SA-mediated Th-B cell interactions induce both polyclonal B cell activation and provide selective help for the proliferation and/or differentiation of B cells that have encountered specific Ag. In additional studies, we determined that the in vivo administration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 to young, athymic (nude) BALB/c mice results in SA binding to splenic B cells, rendering these B cells effective stimulators of and targets for SA-reactive helper TCL cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that microbial SA mediate productive Th-B cell interactions analogous to those that occur during allospecific Th-B cell interactions in vitro and GVHD in vivo. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that microbial SA represent environmental factors that may trigger autoimmune disease in the genetically susceptible host.\r"

In the present study, we show that THAM is the mouse counterpart of the human T cell-activating ectoenzyme CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV, DPP IV) and that highly purified THAM lacks neutral exoaminopeptidase activity. This conclusion is based on the following: 1) the N-terminal segments of the THAM Mr 110,000 and 128,000 components shared the same amino acid sequence with the rat DPP IV. These N-termini comprised a short intracytoplasmic tail of six residues followed by a downstream hydrophobic transmembrane segment. 2) THAM-specific mAb H194-112-Affi-Gel immunoadsorbent was capable of removing DPP IV enzymatic activity from mouse thymoma cell detergent extracts. 3) H194-112 reactivity pattern on developing thymocytes was found to parallel that previously reported for membrane-bound DPP IV enzymatic activity. The extent of THAM N-glycosylation, as measured by N-glycanase treatment of H194-112 immunoprecipitates, was found to be similar to that of human and rat DPP IV (i.e., approximately 20 kDa). Cross-linking experiments indicated that THAM was expressed at the cell surface as a dimer of approximately 220 kDa. Its two subunits were found to be structurally related but not identical as shown by their different Mr under nonreducing conditions and by their slightly distinct peptide profiles after proteolytic cleavage. We conclude from these data that DPP IV, in addition to its extracellular matrix receptor and ectoenzymatic functions, is a T cell-activating structure in both human and mouse species.\r"

  ".W": "Heparan sulfate is a biologically active glycosaminoglycan found in abundance in endothelium, epithelium, and connective tissues. Although heparan sulfate is an important part of the environment in which immune cells function, its effects on the immune system are largely unknown. When present during the first 24 h of an MLC consisting of MHC disparate murine splenocytes, heparan sulfate had a marked stimulatory effect on the proliferative response to alloantigens. Heparan sulfate also augmented the splenocyte response to suboptimal concentrations of the mitogens Con A, anti-CD3 mAb, and ionomycin. The stimulatory action of heparan sulfate was mediated, at least in part, by increased production of IL-1, because the increased splenocyte proliferation induced by heparan sulfate was substantially inhibited by anti-murine IL-1 alpha-antibodies. In contrast to these stimulatory effects, when heparan sulfate was added to MLC 48 to 72 h after onset, decreased splenocyte proliferation was observed. This inhibitory action was mediated by an increase in PGE2 production; the inhibitory effect could be abrogated with indomethacin. The fact that heparan sulfate is present on cells such as endothelial cells with which T cells interact and is released during activation of endothelial cells (thus making it available in soluble form to cells in the immune response) may allow heparan sulfate to play an important role in modulating cell-mediated immune responses in vivo.\r"

This could not be attributed to differences in cell surface TCR expression, TCR-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis or Ca2+ mobilization, or total cellular levels of TCR zeta- and eta-chains. Moreover, thymocytes of all ages were equally susceptible to corticosteroid- and Ca2+ ionophore-induced programmed cell death. These data are consistent with the notion that fetal and neonatal thymocytes represent a relatively synchronous wave of cells passing through phases in which they are susceptible and then resistant to TCR-induced programmed cell death. They also support the notion that the classical phenomenon of neonatal tolerance is due to clonal deletion and that the inability of allogeneic cells to tolerize mice at 1 week of age is because the thymocytes are refractory to TCR-alpha beta-mediated clonal deletion.\r"

  ".U": "91302791\r", 
  ".W": "It has been previously demonstrated that the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160 can inhibit the activation of T cells triggered by phytohemagglutinin, anti-CD3 antibody and Ag, caused in part by the modulation of the expression of CD4. In this study, we show that gp160 is also able to inhibit the Ag-independent adhesion of CD4+ T cells to B cells as anti-CD4 antibodies do. In addition, synthetic peptides (14 to 21 mer) derived from the gp160 sequence and analogous to the putative binding site of gp160 to CD4 (residues 418-460), and also covering residues 460 to 474 inhibit the capacity of both CD4+ T cell proliferation induced by tuberculin and anti-CD3 antibody and adhesion. This was not associated with inhibition of Ca2+ flux in T cell activation. These inhibitory activities are specific because a) CD4+ T cells but not CD8+ T cells are susceptible to their effects, and b) soluble CD4 neutralizes the inhibitory activities. Peptides are, however, about 100- to 1000-fold less potent inhibitors than the native gp160. In addition, they do not induce CD4 modulation. It is thought therefore that at least part of the gp160 inhibitory activity is not secondary to CD4 modulation but may rely either upon steric hindrance of CD4-MHC class II interaction, of CD4/CD3 TCR complex interaction, or upon negative signaling through binding to CD4. The latter hypothesis is suggested by the inhibition by gp160, gp160-derived peptides, and anti-CD4 antibodies of the Ag-independent adhesion of CD4+ T cells. This adhesion process has been previously shown to be mediated by the LFA-1 and CD2 molecules and not by the TCR/CD3 complex and by CD4. Together, these results support the role of part of the 418-460 region of gp160 as a binding site to CD4, and suggest that binding of part of this region to CD4 can alter T cell proliferation and adhesion. It is proposed that these effects are mainly mediated by negative signaling through CD4.\r"

In experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, immunization of LEW rats with bovine retinal S-Ag reveals the presence of three immunodominant T cell recognition sites located in regions containing sequence differences between bovine and rat S-Ag. Immune responses of LEW rats to self (rat) and nonself (bovine and human) peptide homologues representing these three sites were compared. The immunodominant sequences of heterologous S-Ag were found to predict new pathogenic T cell recognition sites in the corresponding autologous rat sequence. Furthermore, in vitro proliferative responses to the pathogenic autologous sequences are dramatically diminished relative to the responses of lymphocytes raised to the non-self homologues. A pathogenic T cell line, R858, efficiently transferred disease, but was unresponsive to the autologous S-Ag peptide in proliferation assays. However, responses to autologous peptides were readily detected using nonirradiated splenic APC. Detection of responses to non-self peptides was independent of this radiosensitive Ag-presenting activity. The lack of in vitro proliferative responses to pathogenic autologous sequences by T cells bearing self-specific receptors, contrasted with the strong proliferation induced by non-self peptide homologues, suggests a mechanism of unresponsiveness to self.\r"

  ".W": "Mixed essential cryoglobulinemia type II (monoclonal Ig/polyclonal IgG) is characterized by systemic vasculitis caused by the deposition of circulating immune reactants that include the monoclonal component. Such reactants may include immune complexes (IC) formed from exogenous Ag. IC binding to E C receptor type 1 appears to play a role in transport and buffering of such IC (immune adherence: IA). To define the mechanisms responsible for immune deposition, 7 patients with cryoglobulinemia type II (IgM kappa/polyclonal IgG) and 14 normal volunteers were injected i.v. with hepatitis B surface Ag/antibody complexes. Two minutes after injection, only 19.4% (mean) of the circulating complexes were bound to E in patients as compared with 63.1% in normal subjects. This IA correlated directly with C4 and inversely with the IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) titer. Disappearance of IC was faster in patients (mean elimination rate: 15.7%/min) than in normal subjects (9.3%). In vitro experiments demonstrated that C depletion, interference with IC opsonization by monoclonal IgM RF, and decreased binding of opsonized IC in the presence of monoclonal RF are each associated with decreased IA. These observations suggest that, in patients with cryoglobulinemia type II, monoclonal IgM RF and low C contribute to reducing IA of circulating IC that might be rapidly trapped in tissues, resulting in injury.\r"

Unstimulated EC were not lysed, but culture in the presence of murine rIFN-gamma resulted in the expression of class II MHC (Ia) molecules and the concomitant ability to function as effective target cells for lysis. The possible requirement for Ia molecules was further demonstrated by antibody-blocking experiments. Lysis of EC targets also required the presence of specific Ag (myelin basic protein); PPD-specific T cell lines also lysed the PPD-pulsed EC. In all cases, lysis was directly proportional to E:T ratios. In addition, continuous passage of T cell lines resulted in the concomitant loss of encephalitogenicity and ability to affect EC lysis, indicating a possible relationship between these two factors. These results demonstrate that CD4+ T cells interact with cerebral vascular EC. It is suggested that such interactions may be important in the pathogenesis of diseases involving migrations of these cells across the blood-brain barrier.\r"

However, C5-deficient mice were protected from these adverse effects. In this study, we show that in mice, platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist prevents TNF- and LPS-induced complement activation, bowel injury, and death, indicating that PAF mediates the actions of TNF and LPS. We then examined the role of the complement system in PAF-induced shock and tissue injury. We found that 1) PAF (3 micrograms/kg) induces shock, hemoconcentration, bowel necrosis, and death in normal mice, whereas C5-deficient mice are protected from these effects. (Protection was abrogated when the dose of PAF was raised to 5 micrograms/kg.) Furthermore, when C5-deficient mice were reconstituted with normal serum, they also developed shock, bowel injury, and death in response to PAF. Thus, C5 is required for PAF to induce injury. 2) PAF activates the complement system in vivo, but not in vitro. The mechanism of complement activation by PAF is unclear. Inasmuch as PAF stimulates neutrophils to release protease that may activate the complement system, we examined the effect of neutrophil depletion on PAF-induced injury and complement activation. We found that neutrophil depletion fails to prevent PAF-induced complement activation, although PAF-induced lethality is much reduced. We conclude that PAF causes complement activation, and acts in synergy with active complement fragments to produce shock and tissue injury. Neutrophils probably do not play the pivotal role in PAF-induced complement activation.\r"

To examine whether a particular IgG subclass is responsible for development of GN in these mice, first quantitative analysis of IgG subclasses in serum and in kidney eluates was performed. Although IgG2a was the dominant subclass in serum throughout the lifespan of mice, the IgG3 level in kidney eluates was three times higher than that of IgG2a at the 16 wk of age, which is the time of onset of development of severe GN. In sera of the 12-wk-old mice, half of the IgG3 was in immune complex form, whereas IgG2a in this form was only 17% of the total amount. Second, cyclosporin A, which ameliorates GN in MRL/lpr mice despite autoantibody production, was found to reduce serum IgG3 and mRNA levels, associated with the revision of cationic shift of the serum IgG3 spectrotype seen in isoelectric focusing. Third, among the hybrid mice with non-autoimmune-prone C3H/HeJ-lpr/lpr (C3H/lpr) mice, MRL/lpr x (MRL/lpr x C3H/lpr) F1, in which the genetic background for GN is likely segregated, the mRNA level for IgG3 correlated well with the degree of glomerular lesion. These findings indicate that production of IgG3 in MRL/lpr mice is one of the major factors responsible for development of GN in these mice, and that this is due to the genetic background of the MRL strain.\r"

  ".W": "Although numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that cytokines are involved in the generation of alloreactive effector cells, the role of these regulatory substances in vivo is less well defined. We have recently cloned and expressed cDNAs encoding both membrane bound and soluble forms of the murine IL-4R. The effects of murine rIL-4 and a recombinant, soluble, extracellular portion of the murine IL-4R soluble(s) IL-4R on the generation of alloresponsiveness in vivo were evaluated by measuring the lymphoproliferative response to a localized injection of allogeneic cells and the survival of cardiac allografts. Administration of IL-4 to BALB/c mice resulted in a slight augmentation of the anti-C57BL/6 lymphoproliferative response compared to that occurring in control, mouse serum albumin-(MSA) treated mice. In contrast, the sIL-4R suppressed this response to allogeneic cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a dose of 50 micrograms/kg/day causing nearly complete inhibition of the response as compared to the response observed in controls. The inhibitory effect of sIL-4R was reversed by simultaneous administration of IL-4. A neutralizing antibody against IL-4 (11B11) and another against the IL-4R (M1) were also effective inhibitors of the response when given at 100- to 1000-fold higher concentrations than the amount of sIL-4R required to inhibit the response. In cardiac allograft experiments, BALB/c mice were engrafted with newborn C57BL/6 hearts in the ear pinnae and treated with sIL-4R (50 micrograms/kg) or MSA. Such allografts survived an average of 4 days longer in sIL-4R-treated mice than in MSA-treated controls. In conclusion, neutralization of IL-4 inhibits alloresponsiveness in vivo. These results confirm a regulatory role for this pleiotropic cytokine in allograft rejection and suggest a therapeutic value for IL-4 antagonists alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive regimens.\r"

We studied the expression of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on T cells in short-term culture of normal human PBMC stimulated with 15 micrograms/ml PHA. PHA stimulation also resulted in the release of soluble Fc epsilon RII/CD23 (IgE binding factor). Using two-dimensional flow cytometry, more than 10% of the Fc epsilon RII/CD23+ cells were found to co-express CD3 Ag. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed Fc epsilon RII/CD23. The induction of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on PHA-activated T cells was enhanced by IL-2 as well as IL-4. Both IL-2 and IL-4 also augmented PHA-induced production of soluble Fc epsilon RII/CD23. The enhanced expression of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on T cells by both lymphokines was suppressed by rabbit anti-IL-4 antiserum, suggesting the involvement of an IL-4-dependent process even in the IL-2-dependent Fc epsilon RII/CD23 expression on T cells. The expression of mRNA for Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on PHA and IL-4-stimulated PBMC was examined by Northern blot analysis. Fc epsilon RII/CD23 mRNA was detected in RNA prepared from the T cell fraction depleted of B cells and macrophages (Fc epsilon RII+CD3+ = 6.2%, Fc epsilon RII+CD3- = 0.8%). The expression of the mRNA for Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on CD3+ T cells was also confirmed by in situ hybridization with Fc epsilon RII/CD23 cDNA combined with CD3 rosette formation at the single cell level.\r"

The data reveal that IL-2 gene transcription does not begin in the thymus until fetal day (Fd) 16. However, IL-2R beta-chain mRNA was detectable throughout the period of investigation, from Fd 14 to 20. This suggests that the potential for high or intermediate affinity IL-2 binding is present in the thymus before the IL-2 gene is actually expressed. Overall, cytokine gene induction occurred in two distinct patterns. In the first group, represented by IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IFN-gamma, and lymphotoxin (lymphotoxin or TNF-beta) there was detectable mRNA present from Fd 14 to 20. IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF followed a second pattern in which gene induction was delayed until Fd 16. The expression of IL-7 and IL-2 genes showed an interesting temporal relationship. IL-7 mRNA transcription occurred before IL-2 but diminished from Fd 16 after the onset of IL-2 gene induction. Because these data reflect the in vivo progression of gene expression during T cell ontogeny, they provide a guideline for assessing the physiologic significance of thymocyte responses to cytokines at different stages of fetal development.\r"

The numbers of c mu+/sIgM- cells were also increased in the IL-7-treated mice. Analysis of the expression of B220 and BP-1 on the sIgM- bone marrow cells revealed that the B220+/BP-1+ population was dramatically increased after IL-7 treatment and the size of the B220+/BP-1- population did not differ from control mice. The pre-B cell numbers declined rapidly after the cessation of IL-7 treatment. After 6 days of IL-7 treatment, a twofold increase in the number of B cells in the spleen and lymph node was observed. The B cell numbers declined to normal values within 6 days after the cessation of IL-7 administration. In the spleens of the IL-7-treated mice, there was a significant increase in the number of B cells with an immature phenotype (e.g., sIgMhi/sIgDlo, decreased levels of Ia and FcR expression). The numbers of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were also increased in the lymph node and spleen of the IL-7-treated mice. These numbers declined to normal levels after the cessation of IL-7 treatment.\r"

To assess the functional significance of the PBA results, the Nef peptides were also tested for their ability to inhibit the lytic activity of human or murine CTL. The PBA results showed that seven partly overlapping regions of the Nef protein contained MHC binding peptides (4-18, 46-67, 73-94, 100-128, 126-155, 182-198, and 192-206). Five of these seven regions included all the already described epitopes recognized by CD8+ human CTL. The two other regions, 4-18 and 46-67, are not yet described as antigenic for human CD8+ cells but they are located in the N-terminal part of Nef that was previously described as being stimulator for rat or chimpanzee CD4+ cells. Altogether, it can be concluded that 1) In virtually 100% of the cases, the PBA is capable to detect known antigenic peptides recognized by CTL. 2) The PBA and the functional inhibition assay provide similar results, supporting the functional significance of PBA results. 3) The PBA is easy to handle on a large scale, using multiple peptide and several MHC molecules, so that it can be used as a routine method for prevision of possibly epitopic sequences. 4) Systematic studies of peptides issued from the whole sequence of a given protein allow to map polyepitopic areas that are probably the most interesting parts of proteins for a vaccine purpose.\r"

Correlations have been searched between the PBA results and the peptide competitor activity in a functional test using HLA-A2-restricted CTL and target cells. A correlation between the data found in the PBA and well-defined CTL epitopes could be attempted only for the three Gag proteins. For these proteins, our results are in agreement with the known existence of epitopes reacting with human CD8+ CTL, with some exceptions. Together with the results reported with a panel of Nef peptides, these experiments showed that at least 18/20 of the already reported CTL epitopes from HIV-1 Gag, Nef, and Env proteins could be detected by the PBA, most (17/18) corresponding to strong reactivities. Perhaps more important, the regions of HIV-1 Gag p24 or Nef proteins that contain multiple associated CTL epitopes, with different HLA restrictions, were clearly identified by the reactivities in the PBA of several overlapping peptides and the major practical interest of the PBA might be the detection of such polyepitopic regions. Prediction are proposed in this report for 10 proteins, including several proteins for which CTL epitopes remain presently unknown.\r"

  ".W": "We probed the functional significance of the region around Cys-241 in human C2 by testing the hemolytic activity of a series of mutant rC2. Mutant C2 cDNA were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and expressed transiently in COS cells. Wild-type rC2 had threefold higher specific hemolytic activity than native serum C2. Substitution of Gly, Ala, or Ser for Cys-241 resulted in a slightly, but significantly, increased activity. In addition, I2 had no effect on the activity of these mutant C2. Substitution of Lys for Gln-243 increased the hemolytic activity by more than two-fold. Increased activity in all cases was due to slower decay rates of the C3 convertase. Finally, substitution of Leu or Ala for Asp-240 or Ser-244, respectively, resulted in more than 100-fold decrease of hemolytic activity. The results suggest that residues 240 to 244 of human C2 represent an important structural determinant of the C4b binding site of C2a. They also confirm that Cys-241 is the residue responsible for the increased activity of C2 reacted with I2.\r"

  ".U": "91302808\r", 
  ".W": "CR2 is a component of a signal transduction complex on B lymphocytes that augments B cell responses to Ag. We have quantitatively assessed binding by the two isotypic forms of CR2 for two of its ligands, the polymerized iC3b (p(iC3b)) fragment of C3, and gp350/220, the EBV membrane protein. The recombinant 15-SCR or 16-SCR forms of CR2 bound p(iC3b) with identical affinities. Full binding activity of CR2 for p(iC3b) was observed with a chimera comprised of SCR-1 and -2 of CR2 fused to SCR-17 through -30 of CR1. Therefore, the alternatively spliced SCR-10a has no role in binding p(iC3b), and the binding activity of wild type receptor for iC3b can be reconstituted with SCR-1 and -2 of CR2. The binding affinities of the two isoforms of CR2 for soluble gp350/220 were also similar. Additional sites in the C3c region of C3 have been postulated also to interact with CR2. However, monomeric iC3b and C3d were equally effective in inhibiting the binding of p(iC3b) to CR2, indicating that the C3c region of iC3b does not contribute to the interaction of iC3b with CR2. Finally, the relative abilities of C3b and iC3b to bind to CR1 and CR2 were compared. The conversion of C3b to iC3b generated a ligand with an approximate 100-fold decrease in affinity for CR1 and a 10-fold increased affinity for CR2, resulting in a 1000-fold greater likelihood for binding to the latter receptor that may then promote B cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "91302809\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the interaction of bispecific mouse mAb with human IgG Fc receptors, and assessed their ability to activate the monocytic cell line U937. Binding of monomeric hybrid anti-HuIgA1/HRP mAb to the high-affinity IgG receptor, Fc gamma RI, on U937 cells was only observed when mAb with one or more mIgG2a H chains (hybrid mIgG1-2a, mIgG2a-2b, and mIgG2a-2a) were used. These Fc gamma RI-bound hybrid mAb were capable of enhancing the internal free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in U937 cells only when bound mIgG were cross-linked using F(ab')2 fragments of goat anti-mIg antibody. A hybrid mIgG1-2a mAb were cross-linked using goat anti-mIgG1 antibody, showing that the hybrid mAb themselves mediate the induction of Ca2+ increase. Remarkably, anti-Fc gamma RII mAb IV.3 was able to inhibit the Ca2+ increase induced via mIgG2a-1 or mIgG1-2a hybrid mAb completely, despite the fact that we could not detect any effect of IV.3 on binding of monomeric hybrid mIgG1-2a or mIgG2a-1 mAb to U937. The hybrid mAb were also able to induce lysis of HuIgA1-coated E using U937 effector cells. This lysis was completely inhibited by preincubation of U937 cells with mIgG2a mAb TB-3, which blocks Fc gamma RI via its Fc-part (\"Kurlander phenomenon\"). In contrast, Fc gamma RII-blocking mAb IV.3 and CIKM5 caused a significant enhancement of the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity mediated by hybrid mIgG1-2a and mIgG2a-2b mAb. This enhancement did not occur when the parental anti-HuIgA1/2a or the hybrid anti-HuIgA1/HRP/2a-2a mAb were evaluated for ADCC activity. These findings suggest that hybrid mAb not only can bind to Fc gamma RI, but can mediate functional activation of myeloid cells. Given the effect of mAb IV.3 on [Ca2+]i changes and ADCC triggered through IgG1-2a mAb, we suggest that Fc gamma RII may have a role in the regulation of Fc gamma RI-triggered functions or signaling.\r"

Although Ii is not required for surface expression of HLA class II molecules, the influence of Ii on post-translational processing and maturation HLA class II molecules has not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, BALB/c 3T3 cells were transfected with HLA-DR alpha- and beta-chains with or without co-transfection with human Ii. Although Ii had no effect on the surface expression of DR, Ii did have a profound effect on the post-translational processing of both the alpha- and beta-chains. In the absence of Ii, the major species of alpha- and beta-chains were of lower m.w. than when expressed in the presence of Ii. The differences in m.w. were shown to be caused by differences in glycosylation with the majority of alpha- and beta-chains remaining unprocessed and endo H sensitive in the absence of Ii. The small proportion of alpha-chains that were processed in the absence of Ii showed an altered m.w. and altered sensitivity to treatment with endo H relative to alpha-chains processed in the presence of Ii. Pulse/chase studies demonstrated that although the majority of the alpha- and beta-chains remained unprocessed in the absence of Ii, the small amount that was processed was done so at a rate similar to that observed for alpha- and beta-chains processed in the presence of Ii. These studies demonstrate that Ii influences the post-translational processing of human class II molecules by affecting the proportion of alpha- and beta-chains that are processed and by determining the degree of processing of oligosaccharides on mature alpha-chains.\r"

Furthermore, using an assay of lymphocyte subset chemotaxis we have been able to show that TGF-beta can induce migration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in vitro. This study provides further evidence that TGF-beta acts as a cytokine, being able to attract T lymphocytes and monocytes to sites of inflammation. Its role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory reactions is likely to be complex.\r"

Monolayers of human endothelial cells (HEC) or PL coated with FCS, fibronectin, laminin, collagen types I and IV, fibrinogen, or fibrin were used as biologic surfaces. Only PMA and FMLP stimulated O2- generation by eosinophils in suspension. Eosinophils residing on HEC monolayers, either untreated or treated with LPS, were unresponsive to all stimuli except PMA. PMA induced O2- generation by eosinophils on all surfaces; FMLP on all surfaces but HEC monolayers; TNF and platelet-activating factor only on PL, fibrinogen, and fibrin; LPS and substance P only on PL. PMA was equally effective on eosinophils on surfaces and in suspension, whereas the effect of FMLP was greater on eosinophils on surfaces than on eosinophils in suspension. IFN-gamma was ineffective on any of the surfaces tested. These results indicate that biologic surfaces may profoundly affect the ability of eosinophils to respond with a respiratory burst to physiologically relevant soluble stimuli, the effect varying according to the nature of both the stimulus and the surface. Since the respiratory burst generates products of oxygen reduction that are toxic to several tissue components, it follows that biologic surfaces may modulate eosinophil-induced tissue injury.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) gene expression by phorbol esters and calcium ionophore (A23187) was studied in HL-60 cells. In untreated HL-60 cells, M-CSF transcripts were undetectable, but transcripts were present within 2 h of A23187 treatment or within 8 h of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu) treatment. Concurrent treatment of HL-60 cells with A23187 and cycloheximide (CHX) for 6 h led to a superinduction of message over A23187 treatment alone. But concurrent treatment with PdBu and CHX for 24 h abolished expression of the message normally present after 24 h of PdBu treatment. The role of new protein synthesis in transcriptional regulation of M-CSF was studied by run-on transcription assay. Untreated HL-60 cells or cells treated with CHX alone do not transcribe M-CSF mRNA. However, cells treated with A23187 for 6 h and CHX for 1, 3, or 6 h transcribed more M-CSF than cells treated with A23187 alone for 6 h. CHX also regulates M-CSF expression by message stabilization. The t1/2 of M-CSF mRNA was 45 min in cells treated with A23187 for 6 h or in cells treated with PdBu for 24 h, was over 2 h in HL-60 cells treated with A23187 for 6 h and CHX for 1 h, and was 3 h in cells treated with PdBu for 24 h and CHX for 1 h. We conclude that M-CSF gene expression can be differentially regulated in HL-60 cells and that new protein synthesis plays an important role in both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.\r"

  ".U": "91302816\r", 
  ".W": "Although most studies of protein phosphorylation have focused on intracellular protein kinases, evidence for protein kinase activity on the surface of several types of cells has been described. Evidence was recently provided for the existence of ecto-protein kinase activity on the surface of human neutrophils. Evidence for three distinct ecto-protein kinase activities was detected, one that phosphorylates endogenous surface proteins, one that phosphorylates exogenous substrates in a cAMP-independent manner and is released in the presence of substrate, and a low level of activity of one that phosphorylates exogenous Kemptide in a cAMP-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate its role in neutrophil function, we have characterized several properties of the releasable ecto-protein kinase activity on human neutrophils. This enzyme activity was inhibited by impermeant stilbene disulfonic acids, which are known to alter neutrophil function, as well as by impermeant sulfhydryl reactive agents. Enzyme activity was detectable at physiologic concentrations of Mg2+, but was higher in the presence of Mn2+. Protein kinase activity was strongly inhibited by heparin, whereas trifluoperazine, cAMP, and cGMP had little effect on kinase activity. Protein kinase activity was selectively removed from the cell surface by incubation with the ecto-kinase substrates casein and phosvitin, but the enzyme was not released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Repeated exposure of neutrophils to substrate depleted ecto-protein kinase activity from the cell surface, but activity was rapidly restored by incubation in buffer lacking substrate. The released protein kinase had a Km for ATP of approximately 0.5 microM and a pH maximum between 7.0 and 7.5. At least four ecto-protein kinase substrates were detected in serum; vitronectin was identified as one of these substrates by immunoprecipitation studies. Although the exact role of ecto-protein kinase activity in neutrophil function remains undefined, the identification of vitronectin as a serum substrate suggests that it interacts with a physiologically important substrate.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombospondin (TSP), a 450-kDa extracellular matrix protein secreted by platelets may be instrumental in triggering polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and mediating PMN-endothelial cell interactions. TSP alone had no effect on O-2 generation but caused a significant increase in the chemoattractant FMLP-mediated O-2 generation. Purified HBD, but not the 140-kDa COOH-terminal fragment of TSP, retained the priming activity indicating that the priming effect was mediated through the HBD of TSP. The priming of FMLP-mediated O-2 generation by TSP, and our recent studies demonstrating that TSP stimulates PMN adhesion and motility suggested the presence of specific receptors for TSP on PMN. Binding studies on unactivated PMN, using 125I-TSP and competition with excess unlabeled TSP, demonstrated 2.4 x 10(3) binding sites/cell with an apparent Kd of 7 nM. Heparin did not compete for binding as effectively as unlabeled TSP. There were 1.5 x 10(3) heparin-inhibitable binding sites/cell with an apparent Kd of 8 nM that represented approximately 60% of the TSP-specific sites. Therefore, two distinct TSP receptors appeared to exist on unactivated PMN; one interacting with the heparin-binding domain of TSP and one interacting with a different site. Treating PMN with cytochalasin B followed by FMLP caused a 30-fold increase in TSP receptor expression. Binding studies on activated PMNs revealed 7.6 x 10(4) sites/cell; 60% of which were heparin inhibitable. The majority (5.3 x 10(4) sites/cell) of receptors expressed had an affinity of approximately 20 nM. About 50% of these sites were heparin inhibitable. In addition, there were 2.3 x 10(4) higher affinity sites/cell with an apparent Kd of 6 nM. Heparin-inhibitable sites comprised 70% of the higher affinity sites. The existence of a subset of TSP receptors that were heparin-inhibitable on PMN suggests that binding of TSP may trigger functionally independent responses. Increased receptor expression and expression of two high affinity binding sites following PMN activation may modulate PMN-endothelium or PMN-basement membrane interactions localized at the blood vessel wall.\r"

Cells were activated by either an appropriate receptor-mediated stimulus or by ionophore A23187 in the presence of [3H]acetate. All cell types, with the exception of the platelet, responded to stimulation with at least a twofold increase in the formation of labeled 1-radyl-2-acetyl-GPC as compared with control values. A23187 was the more potent stimulus in all cell types examined except the lung mast cell, in which anti-IgE consistently induced the synthesis of more 1-radyl-2-acetyl-GPC. Human lung fragments stimulated by anti-IgE, Ag Amb a I (after passive sensitization), or A23187 also incorporated [3H]acetate into 1-radyl-2-acetyl-GPC. Subclass analysis of 1-radyl-2-acetyl-GPC produced by each cell indicated that the cell types examined can be divided into two groups according to the predominant type of 1-radyl-2-acetyl-GPC produced. Some cell types (mast cell, basophil, endothelial cell) produced predominantly 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC, whereas others (neutrophil, eosinophil, lung macrophage) produced almost exclusively PAF. In some cell types, such as the lung mast cell and the basophil, A23187 stimulation increased the synthesis of PAF relative to 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC as compared with anti-IgE stimulation. In the lung fragments, [3H]acetate was predominantly incorporated into 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC upon IgE-mediated stimulation (anti-IgE, Amb a I) and into PAF upon A23187 stimulation. The differential production of these two phospholipids was confirmed by determining their sensitivity to lipase A1 and phospholipase A2 hydrolysis and by HPLC. These data demonstrate that 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC can be synthesized by a variety of human cells involved in the inflammatory reaction. This finding raises fundamental questions about the biologic role of this molecule and the factors regulating its synthesis within inflammatory cells.\r"

Because this immunity is T cell dependent, it is essential to define those Th cell determinants that promote natural boosting of the protective antibody response. The gene for MOMP of serovar B was separated into nine overlapping fragments that represent the five C and four V regions. These fragments were expressed as fusion peptides with GST and used to identify the regions of the MOMP that contain T cell determinants recognized in BALB/c mice. We identified peptides that elicit a T cell response to Chlamydia by immunizing mice with the fusion peptides and testing the proliferative response of T cells in vitro to intact organism. For analysis of determinants seen after infection, animals were inoculated with live organism and the T cell proliferative response to each fusion peptide was measured in vitro. In contrast to proliferative analysis in which several regions of the MOMP elicited T cell responses, functional analysis demonstrated that a single fusion peptide, containing V segment three, elicited T cell help in vivo for the production of high titered antisera, specific for protective determinants on the MOMP.\r"

  ".W": "Markedly elevated titers of anti-leishmanial antibodies are a hallmark of kala-azar. We investigated the role played by the lipophosphoglycan (LPG) in determining the reactivity of kala-azar serum with the surface of Leishmania donovani promastigotes. In assays performed with liver parasites there was negligible agglutination or fluorescent staining of LPG-bearing promastigotes by kala-azar serum, but strong reactivity in both assays with the use of an L. donovani mutant strain (R2D2) that lacks surface expression of LPG. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of 125I surface-labeled promastigotes indicated that kala-azar serum has reactivity with several surface proteins common to both the wild-type and R2D2 strains, and no reactivity with surface proteins unique to R2D2. Although direct ELISA showed that kala-azar serum recognizes purified promastigote LPG, inhibition ELISA suggested that such recognition is based solely upon reactivity with the normally unexposed core-anchor region of the molecule. We conclude that the poor reactivity of kala-azar serum with the surface of L. donovani promastigotes is caused by its lack of recognition of the exposed phosphodisaccharide repeat units of LPG, which in turn effectively mask the surface molecules that are recognized by kala-azar serum antibodies.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse mannose-binding proteins, as with rat and the human forms, have an NH2 terminus that is rich in cysteine that stabilizes a collagen alpha helix followed by a carboxyl- terminal carbohydrate binding domain. We further show that the mouse mannose-binding protein A mRNA, as with the human, is induced like the acute phase reactant serum amyloid P protein, yet the expression of mouse mannose-binding protein C mRNA is not regulated above its low baseline level. The expression of both mannose-binding proteins A and C mRNA is restricted to the liver under basal and stress conditions.\r"

  ".U": "91302826\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study we provide the first evidence supporting the fact that the Kp43 NK-associated cell-surface dimer may be involved in regulating MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity. Our results indicated that incubation of IL-2-activated NK cells in a 51Cr-release assay with either the Kp43-specific mAb or its F(ab')2 fragments induced a significant cytolytic activity directed against normal autologous and allogeneic T cell blasts, which are relatively resistant to NK cell-mediated lysis. The cytotoxic effect was not observed in fresh CD3- CD16+ CD56+ Kp43+ lymphocytes and was only substantiated in IL-2-preactivated NK cells. Although stimulation with the Kp43-specific mAb did not significantly change the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, both Ca2+ and Mg2+ were required for the induction of cytotoxicity. The anti-Kp43-mediated activation of cytolysis was inhibited by anti-CD18 and CD11a mAb, whereas it was not significantly altered by either CD11b, CD11c, CD2, or LFA-3-specific mAb, rendering unlikely the participation of the latter. In contrast to these results the Kp43-specific mAb did not enhance the high levels of spontaneous cytotoxicity mediated by IL-2-activated NK cells against a panel of different tumor cell lines. An inhibitory effect mediated by anti-Kp43 mAb on the IL-2-dependent proliferation of NK cells was previously reported and appears, at least partially, secondary to the induction of an autolytic mechanism that is synergistically enhanced by anti-CD16 mAb. Altogether our results point out that interaction of the Kp43 dimer with its specific mAb is capable of inducing cytolytic activity and suggest that the molecule may play an important functional role in lymphokine-activated NK cells.\r"

  ".U": "91302828\r", 
  ".W": "Lymph nodes (LN) draining progressively growing tumors contain tumor-sensitized but not fully functional preeffector lymphocytes. These cells could acquire therapeutic efficacy and be expanded upon sequential culture with anti-CD3 mAb for 2 days followed by incubation in IL-2 for 3 days. Using the weakly immunogenic MCA 106 and MCA 205 murine sarcomas, we have further defined conditions of this anti-CD3/IL-2 activation with which preeffector cells differentiated into immune effector cells. In vitro activation and expansion of effector cells required sequential but independent stimulation with anti-CD3 and IL-2 because the simultaneous presence of both anti-CD3 and IL-2 at either stage did not enhance the efficacy of activation. Generation of effector cells by this two-stage activation was critically dependent on the optimal concentrations of anti-CD3 (1.0 microgram/ml) and IL-2 (2-10 U/ml). However, these conditions were not optimal for inducing the greatest cellular proliferation. In adoptive immunotherapy experiments, although the transfer of anti-CD3/IL-2-activated cells alone could mediate the regression of established metastases, the concomitant administration of IL-2 enhanced the in vivo activity of these cells. More importantly, tumor regression mediated by the anti-CD3/IL-2-activated cells was found to be immunologically specific. The specificity was determined by the tumor that stimulated the preeffector cell response. In spite of their in vivo antitumor effects, the anti-CD3/IL-2-activated tumor-draining LN cells did not exhibit detectable in vitro cytotoxicity against the tumor target in the 4-h 51Cr-release assay. In mice bearing progressive tumor, draining LN contained most preeffector cells. Some preeffector cells were also detected in the spleen whereas mesenteric LN did not demonstrate any reactivity. In kinetics studies, sensitization of preeffector cells in the draining LN occurred between 4 to 6 days after tumor inoculation. As the tumor progressed, the presence of preeffector cells declined gradually suggesting a tumor-induced suppression. These results define the conditions whereby tumor-draining LN cells could be stimulated, in the absence of tumor Ag, to develop into specific therapeutic effector cells. Our findings also raise the possibility of using similar approaches for isolating immune effector cells from cancer patients for adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium is essential for the movements of cells from the bloodstream into inflammatory sites. In the present study, dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMEC) isolated from normal porcine skin retained the capacity to adhere 51Cr-labeled porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), nylon-wool-purified T cells, and isolated monocytes. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta) decreased the capacities of DMEC to support the adhesion of these cells in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal inhibition was observed with a TGF-beta dose of 0.25 ng/ml and an incubation time of 6-12 h. TGF-beta did not affect the morphology of DMEC and had no adverse effect on the viability of the treated cells. The blocking effects of TGF-beta on PBMC adhesion to DMEC was neutralized by a polyclonal turkey anti-TGF-beta antiserum but not by control turkey serum. Although pretreatment of PBMC with TGF-beta decreased the capacity of these cells to adhere to normal DMEC monolayers, kinetic studies demonstrated that these effects required between 4 and 8 h incubation time. In addition, preincubation of DMEC with TGF-beta completely blocked their response to the stimulating effects of TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, or both cytokines. Furthermore, TGF-beta also abrogated the enhanced adhesiveness of DMEC pretreated with TNF-alpha and IL-1-beta. These findings suggest that TGF-beta may play an important role in the down-regulation of inflammatory responses by decreasing vascular endothelial adhesiveness for mononuclear cells and monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Elemental diets are reported to decrease activity of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. We tested the hypothesis that gluten, given in addition to an elemental diet, is responsible for the intestinal abnormalities, cutaneous immunoreactant deposition, and skin disease activity in dermatitis herpetiformis. At entry eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, who were consuming unrestricted diets, were stabilized on their suppressive medications at dosage levels that allowed individual lesions to erupt. Six patients were then given an elemental diet plus 30 of gluten for 2 weeks, followed by the elemental diet alone for 2 weeks. Conversely, two patients received an elemental diet alone for 2 weeks followed by an elemental diet plus gluten during the final 2 weeks. Small bowel biopsies, skin biopsies, and clinical assessments were done at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Suppressive medication dose requirement decreased over the 4 weeks by a mean of 66%. Six of eight subjects significantly improved clinically during the gluten-challenge phase of the elemental diet and all were improved at the end of the study. The amount of IgA in perilesional skin did not change significantly, but the amount of C3 increased in five of seven evaluable subjects after gluten challenge. Circulating anti-gluten and anti-endomysial antibodies were not significantly affected by the diets. All subjects completing evaluable small bowel biopsies (seven of seven) demonstrated worsening of their villus architecture (by scanning electron microscopy and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts) during gluten challenge and improvement (six of six subjects) after 2 weeks of elemental dietary intake. We conclude that 1) there is a significant improvement in clinical disease activity on an elemental diet, independent of gluten administration, 2) small bowel morphology improves rapidly on an elemental diet, and 3) complement deposition but neither IgA deposition nor circulating antibody levels correlate with gluten intake. It seems likely that dietary factors other than gluten are important in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis.\r"

  ".W": "The adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in conjunction with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) for the treatment of advanced cancer has recently been under intense investigation. Despite extensive research, the precise surface phenotype of TIL remains to be fully defined. To elucidate this unsolved problem, we established 11 TIL clones derived from rIL-2 expanded TIL obtained from B16-F10 murine melanoma tumors. These clones could be divided phenotypically into four groups: CD8 (+) T-cell clones, natural killer (NK)-cell clones, NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clones, and double negative T-cell clones. Functionally, CD8 (+) T-cell clones demonstrated specific cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 melanoma cells, whereas NK-cell clones and double negative T-cell clones demonstrated only non-specific cytotoxic activity against NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clones showed dual cytotoxic activity. Clones T1 [a CD8 (+) T-cell clone] and T2 [an NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clone] which had cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 melanoma cells, demonstrated a proliferative response against immunoblotted B16-F10 melanoma antigens, whereas clones T7 (an NK-cell clone) and T10 (a double negative T-cell clone), which had no cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 cells, demonstrated no proliferative response against them. Winn assays revealed that only the CD8 (+) T-cell clone (T1) had an antitumor effect in vivo, whereas the double negative T-cell clone (T10) and NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clone (T2) stimulated tumor growth in vivo. Adoptive immunotherapy using tumor-specific, highly cytotoxic TIL clones may represent a useful future immunotherapeutic option for the treatment of human tumors.\r"

We have examined 36 primary malignant melanomas (19 regressing, 17 non-regressing) and identified the cellular phenotypes and activation states of the cells infiltrating regressing and non-regressing primary melanomas by immunochemistry. We have found a significantly increased number of CD3-positive cells and an increased ratio of CD4/CD8-positive cells infiltrating regressing compared to non-regressing tumors. In addition, the expression of the interleukin 2 receptor, an activation marker for T cells, was increased. However, there were no significant differences in class II MHC, CD1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), or melanoma-associated differentiation-antigen expression in these tumors. These data are consistent with melanoma regression being induced by activated CD4 T cells and do not seem to be related to the differentiation markers we have examined on these tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure induces profound changes in the synthesis and secretion of various cytokines both in vivo and in vitro. Little is known regarding the mechanism of these responses. This investigation evaluated the effects of UVR on the ability of a murine keratinocyte line (PAM 212) to produce interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Subconfluent rapidly dividing PAM 212 cells were shown by RNA slot-blot hybridization studies to have increased levels of mRNA for both IL-3 and GM-CSF within 1 h of UVR exposure. However, only GM-CSF-specific bioactivity, as determined by antibody neutralization studies, was shown to increase above baseline in cell supernatants. Cells grown to confluence responded differently to UVR. Under these culture conditions an apparent decrease in bioactivity was detected after UVR exposure for both growth factors, and no change in mRNA levels was detected. In addition to culture density, removal of extracellular calcium or sodium during irradiation, treatment with amiloride, or inhibition of new mRNA synthesis with cordycepin was shown to influence the UVR-induced alteration in release of IL-3 or GM-CSF bioactivity from both confluent and subconfluent PAM 212 cells. These results demonstrate that UVR influences the release of the colony stimulating factors GM-CSF and IL-3 from keratinocyte, and suggests that the state of cell growth and conditions of membrane ion transport influence the mechanisms regulating secretion of those factors.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocytes from BALB/c mice photosensitized in vivo to tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA) were investigated to determine whether they could be stimulated to proliferate when cultured with Langerhans cell-enriched cultured epidermal cells (LC-EC) photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA radiation. Cultured LC-EC were photohapten-modified in vitro by irradiation in TCSA-containing medium using a 1000-watt solar simulator equipped with filters to deliver primarily UVA radiation (320-400 nm). Lymphocytes from TCSA-photosensitized mice were incubated with LC-EC that had been treated in vitro with 0.1 mM TCSA and 2 J/cm2 UVA radiation (TCSA + UVA). Responder lymphocytes demonstrated a significant increase in their blastogenesis response compared to lymphocytes that were incubated with LC-EC irradiated with UVA prior to treatment with TCSA (UVA/TCSA) or with LC-EC that had received no treatment. Lymphocytes from naive mice or mice photosensitized with musk ambrette (MA) demonstrated a significantly lower response to LC-EC modified with TCSA + UVA, indicating the specificity of the response. Maximum blastogenesis response was achieved when LC-EC were treated with 0.1 mM TCSA and a UVA radiation dose of at least 0.5 J/cm2. Epidermal cells depleted of LC by treatment with anti-Ia antibody plus complement or by an adherence procedure were unable to stimulate this blastogenesis response. Epidermal cells treated in vitro with TCSA + UVA demonstrated enhanced fluorescence compared to control cells. The fluorescence observed was not restricted to any specific epidermal cell type; however, fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that dendritic Ia-positive cells, presumably LC, were also TCSA fluorescent. Flow cytometry showed that Ia-positive epidermal cells demonstrated the greatest UV fluorescence when treated with TCSA + UVA compared to both cells irradiated with UVA and subsequently treated with TCSA and untreated cells. This is consistent with the enhanced antigen presentation capability of TCSA + UVA treated LC-EC, which leads to the conclusion that LC photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA demonstrate enhanced TCSA fluorescence and are capable of stimulating lymphocytes from TCSA photosensitized mice in an antigen-specific manner.\r"

No difference was found, however, for collagen III, collagenase, and fibronectin mRNA levels in SSc and control biopsies. The selective increase of collagen alpha 1(I) mRNA levels indicates a specific alteration of fibroblast metabolism in scleroderma.

  ".U": "91302873\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca++]i) play an important role in a variety of biochemical reactions that lead to cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation. The response of [Ca++]i to extracellular nucleotides (ATP, UTP, ITP, and AMP-PNP) was determined in individual canine keratinocytes using the fluorescent probe fura-2 and digital video fluorescence imaging microscopy. In the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular Ca++, 100 and 500 microM ATP caused a rapid (less than 9 sec) three- to twelvefold rise in [Ca++]i above resting levels of 50-150 nM followed by occasional fluctuations. Small responses were elicited with doses as low as 0.1 microM ATP. The response of cells stimulated with 500 microM ATP in Ca(++)-free medium was characterized by 1.5 to 3 times rapid initial peak followed by a decrease of [Ca++]i below resting levels. Loss of response occurred in the majority of keratinocytes preincubated for 30 min in Ca(++)-free medium. UTP was as effective as ATP in stimulating rises in [Ca++]i in keratinocytes. Smaller elevations in [Ca++]i up to four- to fivefold resting levels were noted with 100 microM AMP-PNP or 500 microM ITP. Desensitization of cells was demonstrated when a second stimulation followed the primary ATP or UTP treatment. These results are suggestive of the presence of purinergic receptors in the cytoplasmic membrane of canine keratinocytes. Experiments using the calcium channel blocker lanthanum suggest that ATP-induced initial rises and sustained levels of [Ca++]i are dependent on the release of Ca++ from intracellular stores. These intracellular Ca++ stores appear to be rapidly depleted after removal of extracellular calcium ([Ca++]e), thereby abolishing ATP-induced [Ca++]i increases.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing evidence suggests an immunoregulatory function of the potent steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) which has been successfully applied for treatment of psoriasis. The skin is both a site of production and a target of 1,25(OH)2D3. In vitro, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes. We investigated the in situ expression of vitamin D-receptors (VDR) in normal and psoriatic skin by immunochemical methods. The VDR were visualized using the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 9A7g to the VDR and the labeled avidinbiotin technique. Immunoreactivity was consistently confined to nuclei in all skin biopsies. In normal skin specimens (n = 10) VDR antigens were expressed in keratinocytes of all epidermal layers (except those of the stratum corneum) and in cells of the epidermal appendages. Double labeling experiments with MoAb to cluster-defined antigens indicated that melanocytes and approximately 75% of Langerhans cells exhibit 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in normal skin biopsies (n = 5). Depending on their localization in skin compartments 42-62% of CD11b+ positive macrophages and 45-75% of CD3+ T lymphocytes expressed VDR. Non-lesional psoriatic skin specimens (n = 8) revealed nearly identical staining patterns. Lesional psoriatic skin specimens (n = 8) exhibited a significant increase of VDR expression both in basal and suprabasal epidermal layers as measured by computer-assisted morphometry and showed a remarkable change of the immune cell pattern: the densitity and proportion of VDR positive T lymphocytes and macrophages were higher in the epidermal and the perivascular papillary loop compartment. These in vivo findings strongly support the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates immune response and cell proliferation/differentiation in human skin.\r"

  ".W": "Untreated, clinically active keloids were examined as model system to study the spatial expression of extracellular matrix and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) genes in fibrotic skin diseases. In situ hybridizations localized active expression of type I and VI collagen genes to the areas containing an abundance of fibroblasts and apparently representing the expanding border of the lesions. Within this zone, microvascular endothelial cells also expressed the type I collagen genes, as evaluated by simultaneous use of in situ hybridization for collagen gene expression and immunolocalization for factor VIII-related antigen, a marker for endothelial cell differentiation. Slot-blot hybridizations of RNA isolated from this zone suggested that the expression of type I and IV collagen genes was selectively enhanced, as compared to type III collagen gene expression. TGF-beta 1 protein and mRNA were also detected in areas active in type I and type VI collagen gene expression, indicating that TGF-beta 1 gene is transcribed and the corresponding protein is deposited in areas of elevated collagen gene expression, including microvascular endothelial cells. We conclude that the initial step in the development of fibrotic reaction in keloids involves the expression of the TGF-beta 1 gene by the neovascular endothelial cells, thus activating the adjacent fibroblasts to express markedly elevated levels of TGF-beta 1, as well as type I and VI collagen genes.\r"

  ".W": "The association of specific HLA-C nucleotide sequences with psoriasis vulgaris was investigated in 75 Japanese patients by the polymerase chain reaction method, followed by slot-blot hybridization using two specific oligonucleotide probes. The synthesized nucleotide primers were C180P, 5'-GACCGGGAGACACAGAAGTACAAG-3' (coding for amino acid residues 61 to 68 of the alpha 1 domain of the HLA-C molecule) and C243PR, 5'-GCTCTGGTTGTAGTAGCCGCG-3' (residues 82 to 88), respectively. The amplified sequence detected with the probe C208A (5'-AGGCACAGGCTGACCGA-3'), including the coding region for alanine at position 73, was significantly increased in frequency in the patients compared with the healthy individuals (81% versus 48%, relative risk = 4.7, chi 2 = 15.3, p less than 0.0001). This specific nucleotide sequence is common to Cw6 and Cw7, but some other HLA-C alleles including Cw4 and C blank (Cx52) also proved to have this sequence. It is suggested that alanine at position 73 of HLA-C molecules can be a good marker for psoriasis vulgaris and that this residue may play an important role in determining susceptibility to this disease.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies of strict specificity for human IgG subclasses were used. Sera from 20 patients with BP served as controls. In addition, total IgG subclass levels were determined by indirect competitive ELISA in all sera. Complement binding capacity was studied by IIF using antibodies to C3 after incubation of skin section with autoantibodies and source of fresh complement. CP autoantibodies reacting with the 230-240 kD and/or the 180-kD epidermal bands showed an IgG4/IgG1 subclass restriction, with a predominance of IgG4 in 10 cases, of IgG1 in four. In BP sera, IgG4 and IgG1 autoantibodies were detected with a similar frequency (100% and 83%, respectively). In EBA sera, autoantibodies reacting with the 290 kD and 145 kD dermal bands also showed an IgG1/IgG4 restriction. Concordant results were obtained by IIF. However, the IIF method had a lower sensitivity for the detection of IgG4 CP antibodies and IgG1 EBA antibodies than immunoblotting. Finally, when CP antibodies were analyzed for their complement-binding activity, it was found that sera containing IgG4 autoantibodies alone never fixed complement whereas all complement-fixing CP sera had IgG1 autoantibodies, suggesting that only this subclass of antibodies is capable of fixing complement.\r"

In preputial skin, AR was expressed in epidermal cells as well as in fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells of blood vessels in the dermal area. AR was found located also in the flat fibroblast-like cells of Pacinian corpuscles. In nongenital skin, AR was also expressed in the basal cells and glandular cells of sebaceous glands, in the outer root sheath of hair follicles, and in eccrine sweat glands. The presence of AR in different cell types in the skin reflects the numerous direct effects androgens may have on this target tissue. The distribution of AR was similar in male and female skin.\r"

We found also a negative association between HLA-A11 and skin cancer; none of the 66 transplant recipients with skin cancer were positive for HLA-A11. As HLA-A11 seems to have a protective effect against skin cancer, we speculate that antigens induced by squamous cell carcinomas and possibly also by human papillomavirus may be efficiently presented through HLA-A11 to cytotoxic T cells. We also investigated a possible influence of other HLA alleles on the susceptibility of renal transplant recipients to skin cancer. The frequency of HLA-B27 was significantly higher in the transplant recipients with skin cancer, with a relative risk of 3.4 relative to healthy controls. No significant differences were found for other HLA class I or class II antigens.\r"

Each group of studies showed a general consensus on timing, and the composite curve showed a regular sinusoidal pattern. The rhythms in mice and rats were the same, whereas those in humans were in the opposite phase and had reduced amplitudes. In the rodents, S-phase peaked at about 3:30 A.M. and M-phase peaked at about 8:30 A.M. In humans S-phase peaked at about 3:30 P.M. and M-phase peaked at about 11:30 P.M.

  ".W": "An apparent tissue-specific growth inhibitor, or chalone, obtained from psoriatic lesions was tentatively identified in the 100-kDa fraction based upon inhibition of DNA synthesis, as measured by [3H]-thymidine uptake by a squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SCC 38. This fraction, however, failed to inhibit SCC 38 cell growth when assessed directly in a neutral red uptake assay. Characterization of the inhibitor of [3H]-thymidine uptake revealed it to have biochemical properties identical to thymidine phosphorylase: 1) molecular weight close to 100 kDa, 2) isoelectric point of 4.2, and 3) thymidine phosphorylase enzyme activity. Thus, we conclude that its ability to inhibit [3H]-thymidine uptake was due to thymidine catabolism rather than inhibition of DNA synthesis or growth inhibition. Examination of thymidine phosphorylase activity in keratome biopsies from psoriatic and normal skin demonstrated a twentyfold increase in activity in psoriatic lesions relative to non-lesional or normal skin. This increase in metabolism of thymidine was due to thymidine phosphorylase rather than uridine phosphorylase activity. The correlation between increased thymidine phosphorylase activity and increased keratinocyte proliferation in vitro (cultured) and in vivo (psoriasis), suggests that this enzyme may play a critical role in providing the thymidine necessary for keratinocyte proliferation.\r"

To study retinol delivery, human keratinocytes (HKc) were incubated with [3H]retinol added directly to the culture medium or bound to RBP and the uptake of [3H]retinol was determined at various times. During the first hour of incubation, the rate of [3H]retinol accumulation by HKc was about 40 times greater when the vitamin was added directly to the media rather than bound to RBP. Although maximal uptake of [3H]retinol added directly to the culture medium occurred at 3 h, the uptake of [3H]retinol from RBP was linear with time for at least 72 h. By 57 h, cell-associated [3H]retinol was the same whether it was added directly to the culture medium or bound to RBP. Excess unlabeled retinol or pretreatment of HKc with retinol had no effect on the uptake of [3H]retinol added directly to the culture medium or bound to RBP. Apo- but not holo-RBP was capable of competing with HKc for the uptake of [3H]retinol from RBP. No specific or saturable binding of 125I-labeled RBP to HKc cultured in the absence or the presence of retinol was found. The dose response of retinol inhibition of cholesterol sulfate synthesis and phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity or retinol modulation of keratin expression was the same whether the retinol was delivered to HKc bound to RBP or added directly to the medium. Our data support a mechanism for retinol delivery from RBP to HKc that does not involve cell-surface RBP receptors but instead suggest that the vitamin is first slowly released from RBP and then becomes cell-associated from the aqueous phase. This mechanism is consistent with the finding that HKc respond identically to retinol whether or not it is delivered to them bound to RBP.\r"

It was found that nC5a induced histamine release from CMC but not from PMC, with a maximal net release at 250 ng/ml nC5a (22.8 +/- 2.6%). Kinetic experiments demonstrated that nC5a-induced maximal net histamine release occurred 5 min after the presentation of this stimulus (25.8 +/- 6.0%). Using rC5a and CMC, dose-response studies indicated a maximal net release of 7.0 +/- 1.7% at rC5a of 10 ng/ml, and kinetic studies showed a maximal net release at 5 min of incubation (12.9 +/- 1.6%). Release induced by rC5a was calcium-dependent, and peaked at 30 degrees C. These results indicate that functional heterogeneity exists between the CMC and the PMC of BALB/c mice, that C5a is a relevant stimulus for characterization of this heterogeneity, and that CMC from these animals can serve as a convenient in vitro model for the study of human C5a-mast cell interactions. In vivo, injections of nC5a (25-100 ng) and rC5a (25-100 ng) into the skin of BALB/c mice induced an increase in cutaneous vasopermeability, as assessed by the extravasation of intravenously injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. nC5a induced a dose-dependent increase in vasopermeability, whereas alterations induced by rC5a plateaued at 50 ng. The C5a-induced vasopermeability was markedly enhanced in animals that had been previously treated with an inhibitor of serum carboxypeptidase, which converts C5a to the less potent derivative, C5a des Arg. These findings suggest that carboxypeptidase plays an important role in vivo in the modulation of C5a-induced cutaneous inflammation in murine skin.\r"

Six sera (3.2%) stained both the epidermal and dermal sides of split skin, 173 (93.5%) stained only the epidermal side, and 6 (3.2%) only the dermal side. All six sera with a combined staining pattern yielded the same pattern when tested with three different specimens of skin, indicating that this pattern is reproducible. By immunoblot analysis, five (83%) of the six combined staining sera reacted to a 160-kD antigen present only in epidermal extracts of normal skin, one reacted in addition to a 230-kD epidermal antigen, and one did not react to either epidermal or dermal extracts.

Eighteen (90%) of twenty representative epidermal staining sera reacted to a 230-kD epidermal antigen and seven (35%) sera (five with the 230-kD antibody and two without) also reacted to the 160-kD epidermal antigen. Affinity purified antibody to the 160-kD antigen defined by combined staining sera reacted to the BMZ of normal human skin. These results indicate that the combined staining pattern on 1 M NaCl split skin is due to the presence of a distinctive antibody response directed predominantly to a 160-kD BMZ antigen located on the epidermal side of the split skin and to an as yet unidentified BMZ antigen located on the dermal side.\r"

Although the precise role of this antigen in the pathogenesis of DH is unclear, one theory proposes that patients with DH possess a molecularly unique subtype of the HLA-DQw2 antigen that causes immune abnormalities eventuating in the clinical manifestations of DH. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the highly polymorphic HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci of eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. All DQB1 alleles sequenced were identical to the previously described HLA-DQB*0201 allele from HLA-DQw2 normal subjects. In addition, DQA1 alleles sequenced were identical to those alleles previously associated with HLA-DQw2 (DQA*0201, DQA*0501). These data document that although HLA-DQw2 appears to be a necessary element in the pathogenesis of DH, the development of DH is not dependent on the presence of a unique HLA-DQw2 antigen. HLA-DQ allelic typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 fragments was also performed in ten patients with DH to determine the allelic distribution among both HLA-DR3 (eight patients) and non-DR3 (two patients) DH patients. At the HLA-DQ beta chain locus, all patients possessed the DQB1*0201 allele. At the HLA-DQ alpha chain locus, all HLA-DR3 patients and one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0501 allele, whereas one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0201 allele. These data document that patients with DH do not express a unique HLA-DQw2 heterodimer, that the HLA-DQw2 molecules present in patients with DH have no DNA sequence differences from those found in normal HLA-DQw2 subjects and therefore that susceptibility to DH is not due to a unique HLA-DQw2 molecule.\r"

This papilloma-carcinoma complex in rabbits provides an experimental model for human papillo-mavirus-associated malignancies. The aim of this study was to prepare an experimental system in inbred rabbits by establishing culture cell lines of the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma developed from a Shope papilloma that had been induced 6 months previously by inoculating CRPV into an inbred B/J rabbit. By in vitro culturing of the tumor cells, cell lines with potentials for terminal differentiation and tumorigenicity were established. Cloning yielded sublines that varied in these potentials and possessed episomal and integrated CRPV genomes as revealed by Southern hybridization in both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Major CRPV-specific transcripts were similarly observed both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated sublines. Immunofluorescence with syngeneic rabbit antibody against tumor-specific antigens localized such antigens mainly in the nuclei of the cells of these sublines. This experimental system allows experiments that were not feasible in randomly bred rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "Transformed keratinocytes (i.e., SCC-4, SCC-15, SCC-12F2, SVK14) or normal keratinocytes which differ in their differentiation program, were used to study the regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor expression. The capacity of the cells to differentiate was modulated by changing the extracellular calcium concentration. We now demonstrate that LDL-receptor expression in normal and transformed keratinocytes depends on the cell type and one or more levels of regulatory control. Cells express elevated mRNA levels when cultured under low Ca++ (proliferating) conditions. In contrast, SV40-transformed keratinocytes express decreased message under similar condition. In addition, LDL-receptor protein is decreased in transformed cells when extracellular Ca++ is increased (1.6 mM) to stimulate differentiation; the decrease in protein is comparable to the decrease in mRNA expression. Under the same conditions, normal keratinocytes show markedly decreased LDL-receptor protein relative to the decrease in mRNA. Incubation with LDL-cholesterol decreases the number of cell surface-exposed LDL-receptors. The LDL-receptor in fibroblasts is regulated differently from SCC-4 cells. The addition of LDL-cholesterol to fibroblasts causes decreased LDL-receptor mRNA and protein expression whereas SCC-4 cells show the opposite effect. The addition of cholesterol in non-lipoprotein form causes decreased LDL-receptor mRNA and protein expression in both cell types. These results suggest another, yet unidentified, regulatory mechanism that affects LDL-receptor expression in these two cell types.\r"

  ".W": "There are two types of melanin in mammals, the brownish black eumelanin and the reddish yellow pheomelanin. Eumelanin and pheomelanin are present in human hair and this study was carried out to see whether both pigments are also present in human epidermis. Samples of epidermis were obtained from suction blisters raised in the upper arm of 13 Caucasian subjects of skin types I, II, and III and analyzed for both eumelanin and pheomelanin using a procedure involving high-performance liquid chromatography. Eumelanin and pheomelanin were found in all epidermal samples and their relative proportions correlated well with those found in samples of hair taken from the same subjects. The lowest concentrations of eumelanin were found in subjects of skin type I, with higher levels in skin types II and III. The concentrations of pheomelanin were more variable and showed no relationship to skin type. Increases in the concentrations of both pigments occurred following PUVA therapy, but whereas the largest increases in eumelanin were seen in skin types II and III, the increases in pheomelanin showed little relationship to skin type. Unlike eumelanin, epidermal pheomelanin also showed little relationship to PUVA-induced tanning. The present findings could be particularly significant in view of recent suggestions that pheomelanin, rather than protecting the skin against UV radiation, may actually contribute to UV-induced skin damage.\r"
