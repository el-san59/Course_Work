  ".W": "To identify the papillomavirus types associated with condylomata acuminata in children and to evaluate their mode of transmission, we studied 32 children with anogenital warts. External condylomata were found in 12 of their mothers and in 10 of their fathers. Ten mothers, including two without external lesions, had cervical condylomata. Blot hybridization studies disclosed a genital human papillomavirus (HPV) in 14 of 27 children (HPV-6 in 12 and HPV-11 in two) and in 8 of 14 patients (HPV-6 in all). HPV-6 was found in another child by the polymerase chain reaction technique. Infection occurred most likely at birth or from nonsexual contact, but sexual abuse could not be excluded in one 11-year-old girl. Cutaneous HPV-2 was found in seven children and as yet uncharacterized papillomaviruses were found in two children. Three mothers of HPV-2-infected children had common hand warts, and two children had subungual warts. This study shows the frequent nonsexual transmission of genital papillomaviruses in children and the unexpectedly high association of children's condylomata with papillomaviruses responsible for skin warts, possibly transmitted by heteroinoculation or autoinoculation.\r"

A large number of lymphocytes expressed antigens associated with cellular activation, suggesting an ongoing immunologic response by the host against the tumor, although evidence of in situ proliferation of these cells was lacking. These findings suggest that the infiltrate found in association with cutaneous tumors does not represent passive accumulation of lymphocytes from the circulation but rather an active antitumor response.\r"

PUVA therapy was delivered to the entire skin but not to the oral mucosa, and immunosuppressive therapy was continued in all patients. Two patients' skin lesions improved considerably; the oral lesions healed and did not recur in one. Immunosuppressive therapy could be reduced in these two patients. One patient with sicca signs did not improve. One patient had to interrupt PUVA therapy because of side effects attributed to 8-methoxypsoralen (nausea and vomiting). No flare of acute cutaneous graft-versus-host disease was noted during PUVA therapy. Chronic graft-versus-host disease of the liver did not improve in any patient.\r"

Hemorrhage, iron deposition, and inflammation were not part of the lesion. Ulex europaeus agglutinin I labeled the lesional endothelial cells consistently, but factor VIII-related antigen labeling was negative. This histologic pattern and the special studies suggested a lymphatic lesion. Surgical excision, performed in six patients, was not followed by recurrence.\r"

We could not demonstrate a true estrogen receptor in any benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanomas, or metastatic melanomas. Thus the ability to bind estrogen or progesterone does not correlate with the presence of a true estrogen receptor. Lack of nuclear estrogen receptors suggests that the influence of estrogen on the pathophysiology of melanoma or of benign melanocytic nevi may not be significant.\r"

Disease-related cutaneous features of HIV-associated disseminated histoplasmosis are defined as mucocutaneous lesions from which fungal organisms were either cultured or demonstrated histopathologically. We report four HIV-seropositive patients with disseminated histoplasmosis who had culture-positive skin or oral lesions of histoplasmosis and review the specific cutaneous manifestations of HIV-associated disseminated histoplasmosis. Including our patients, disease-related skin and/or mucosal lesions were present in 11% of patients (26% of 239) with HIV-associated disseminated histoplasmosis. The possibility of disseminated histoplasmosis should be considered in all HIV-infected persons and in persons with AIDS risk factors who have fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and new cutaneous lesions. An early skin or mucosal biopsy specimen for crushed tissue preparation, histologic evaluation, and fungal culture is a simple, rapid diagnostic procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Although the UVB portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (290 to 320 nm) is responsible for most of the harmful effects of sunlight on the skin, wavelengths in the UVA region also contribute to photodamage. A simple and rapid clinical test, the sun protection factor determination, is available to assess the sunburn protective effect of a sunscreen, primarily a UVB effect. However, no practical test has been proposed to measure a sunscreen's UVA protection. We described a method for the calculation of UVA protection in normal subjects. The determination of UVA protection involves three steps: (1) the UV absorbance spectrum of the sunscreen on skin is determined spectrophotometrically; (2) a convolution spectrum is calculated by multiplying the solar spectrum with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage UV Hazard Spectrum; and (3) the sunscreen transmission spectrum is then incorporated into the convolution spectrum to obtain the UVA effectiveness ratio, which can be expressed as the UVA protection percentage. Because the UVA protection percentage value is based both on normal erythemic risk and on standard sunlight, the protection for any product can be easily measured. The procedure is simple, and values generated can be reproduced in other laboratories.\r"

  ".W": "Two topical formulations of 2.5% hydrocortisone were tested to investigate the possible correlation between the blanching response of topically applied hydrocortisone and its release from the formulation after its penetration into the stratum corneum. After application of the cream, the stratum corneum was removed at different intervals and the hydrocortisone content was measured by radioimmunoassay. The blanching responses (expressed as mean score vs time) showed a 1.5-fold difference (significant at p = 0.0026) between the two creams at the maximum effect, which was reached for both creams after 16 hours. The amounts of hydrocortisone present in the stratum corneum after every application period showed a twofold difference (p = 0.0001) between the two creams. However, in contrast to the blanching, these quantities remained constant from 4 to 24 hours. This steady state characteristic may be partially due to the use of occlusion and to the excess formulation remaining at the surface. Although there is no parallelism with time between the results of the two methods, both give clear evidence of a difference in stratum corneum penetration and pharmacologic activity of the two formulations. Drug penetrations and pharmacodynamic activities of the two creams can be correlated with in vitro release characteristics.\r"

From a review of 89 cases of the disease seen since 1974 it seems that a more realistic classification into three main groups, according to the distribution of pityriasis lichenoides lesions, could be made, namely, a diffuse, a central, and a peripheral form, each characterized by a different clinical course. Conversely, no correlations were detected in our series between the severity of skin lesions and their distribution or the overall course of the disease. None of our cases suggests the possible evolution of pityriasis lichenoides into lymphomatoid papulosis. Although no infectious causative agent has been identified, a viral origin seems likely in some cases. Most patients responded favorably to UVB irradiation. Our conclusions are (1) that pityriasis lichenoides is probably a clinical disorder with a diverse etiology and (2) that its classification by distribution seems more useful than its subdivision into an acute and a chronic form.\r"

Patch tests performed on 14 patients with proved systemic photosensitivity to piroxicam were positive for thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid. Nine of 12 patients previously sensitized to thiosalicylic acid and with no history of exposure to piroxicam showed positive photopatch test reactions to this chemical. These results support a relation between piroxicam-induced photosensitivity and contact sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid. Contact allergic sensitivity to the latter is a marker for patients with a high risk of developing photosensitivity reactions to piroxicam. These reactions may be due to photoproducts of the drug rather than metabolites.\r"

The increase in mycotic disorders is due to many factors, such as longer life span, organ transplantation, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The pharmaceutical industry is providing physicians with newer, more potent drugs to manage mycoses. An overview of current practice in the use of topical and oral agents, especially ketoconazole, are given in the following specific mycoses: tinea capitis, pityriasis versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis, Trichophyton rubrum infections, vaginal candidiasis, and moist intertriginous tineas. The efficacy of ketoconazole in various vehicles and dosage schedules and of traditional agents such as griseofulvin are discussed with relation to each of the mycoses.\r"

The organisms disappear slowly from the skin, even when dead, and the results should be assessed clinically and mycologically at around 3 to 4 weeks after treatment. Numerous studies have shown that itraconazole is superior to placebo and as effective as selenium sulfide, clotrimazole, and ciclopirox olamine. It is also better tolerated by patients than selenium sulfide.\r"

The fixed schedules indicated by pharmacokinetics and clinical studies are one 100 mg capsule daily for 15 days in cases of tinea corporis and tinea cruris and the same dosage for 30 days in cases of tinea pedis and tinea manuum. These fixed treatments have some limitations, and they are not recommended for treating tinea capitis and tinea unguium. The drug is well tolerated.\r"

In one group of 20 patients treated for 30 days, 6 patients were clinically and mycologically healed. By the 2-week follow-up visit 9 additional patients were healed, and 4 weeks after treatment all 20 patients were both clinically and mycologically healed. The primary organisms reported were Microsporum canis and Trichophyton tonsurans. Only one patient reported a possible side effect (tired legs). Laboratory values were all within normal limits, except for one patient who had a transient and slight increase in serum transaminase level. Low-dose itraconazole appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of tinea capitis.\r"

The orally active antifungal agent itraconazole has been evaluated in a number of different patient populations with oral and oropharyngeal candidosis. Initial studies have shown that itraconazole, 100 or 200 mg/day for 14 days, is more active than placebo in treating oral candidosis. A comparative study between itraconazole capsules (200 mg once daily) and clotrimazole troches (10 mg five times daily) showed equivalent results at the end of therapy but a significantly faster response to itraconazole and a faster relapse rate with clotrimazole. A study in AIDS patients with oropharyngeal candidosis demonstrated that itraconazole, 200 mg/day, and ketoconazole, 400 mg day, for 4 weeks give equivalent clinical cure rates and similar relapse rates. A pilot study with an oral solution of itraconazole has given an impressive 100% clinical and mycological response rate within 1 week of treatment. In conclusion, itraconazole in capsule or in solution form may constitute a major addition to the armamentarium of drugs against oropharyngeal candidosis.\r"

The results obtained in the Maria Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands, and a review of foreign data suggest the following: (1) For acute infection oral and topical agents produce equivalent results. (2) For chronic infections oral medication is preferred. (3) Oral therapy should not be given to pregnant patients or to patients not using reliable contraceptive measures.

Multiple topical formulations are available, yet there is little evidence to suggest that formulation per se influences outcome. A growing number of highly effective oral systemic antimycotic agents provide the practitioner with additional options. Treatment regimens have also changed with the introduction of shorter, often single-day/single-dose courses of therapy. Not all therapeutic agents have the same activity against vaginal fungal pathogens in that topical azoles tend to be more active than nystatin. Differences in patient characteristics, however, are more important than the differences between antimycotic agents and therapeutic regimens in determining selection of the appropriate antimycotic. Patients with vaginal candidiasis vary with regard to duration and severity of symptoms and past frequency of attacks, distribution of inflammation, and pregnancy status. The clinician should consider all these variables both in selecting the appropriate antimycotic agent and the route of administration and in planning the duration of therapy. Individualized therapy offers additional benefits to patients, who may then enjoy the maximum advantages of antimycotics now available.\r"

One patient had received only prior surgical intervention. Fungi of seven different genera caused disease of the skin in nine patients, soft tissue in nine, sinuses in eight, bone in five, joints in two, and lungs in two. Itraconazole was given in dosages ranging from 50 to 600 mg/day for 1 to 48 months. Clinical improvement or remission occurred in nine patients. Two patients have had stabilization of disease. Six patients failed treatment, one had a relapse after initially successful treatment.

Response to itraconazole alone was obtained in the case of sporotrichosis and in 24 of 34 patients with different forms of aspergillosis (of the 18 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, 15 were cured). Patients with cryptococcosis received itraconazole for active infection and/or for prevention of relapse. Active infection was treated successfully with itraconazole alone in 9 of 12 patients and with itraconazole plus flucytosine in 8 of 10 patients. Of the 31 patients who received itraconazole maintenance therapy for up to 27 months, 4 (13%) had relapses; 14 (45%) did not have relapses, and decline of serum antigen was detected in 12 of them; and 13 (42%) were completely cured (serum antigen titer dropped to zero).

Of 28 patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 18 achieved complete responses, including 16 of 24 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Other manifestations of cryptococcosis were similarly responsive. In aspergillosis 12 of 15 patients responded, including 8 of 10 immunocompromised hosts. These patients included those with invasive pulmonary disease (4/5), skeletal disease (2/2), pleural disease (1/2), and pericardial, sinus, mastoid, hepatosplenic, or nail disease (1/1). These results with itraconazole compare favorably to conventional (parenteral) therapy, and toxicity was minimal. This suggests that comparative trials are now in order.\r"

Itraconazole was prescribed alone or in combination or after treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Of 14 aspergilloma patients, 2 were cured and 8 had symptomatic improvement. In chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, 7 of 14 patients were cured and 6 improved significantly. In invasive aspergillosis treatment failed in 6 patients and 15 were cured.

Accordingly, there is a salient need for national standards of education in the field. Implant education varies widely for practicing dentists, postdoctoral students, and predoctoral students. Although many schools are starting to teach implant dentistry in their predoctoral curricula, clinical and laboratory experience is limited. There are not enough trained professors, funding for new departments is limited, and change is often met with resistance. It is anticipated that within the decade, schools will establish departments, divisions, or sections dedicated to education in implant dentistry, despite these obstacles.\r"

The dental profession has enthusiastically embraced the clinical results of implant treatment and its benefits to the patient. However, just as patients who undergo periodontal and restorative treatment must continue a regular long-term routine of maintenance therapy to ensure their dental health, so must those patients who receive dental implants. Both the periodontist who places the implants and the dentist who fabricates the prosthetic replacement must work cooperatively to deliver a healthy restoration that will function for many years.\r"

  ".U": "91010297\r", 
  ".W": "Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 23 consecutive adult patients with an atrial septal aneurysm. In three patients with a cerebrovascular event the diagnosis was established by the transesophageal approach only. Interatrial shunting on transthoracic imaging with use of echocardiographic contrast imaging or Doppler color mapping, or both, was detected in 7 (41%) of 17 patients. On performing contrast imaging in combination with color flow mapping during transesophageal echocardiography, positive shunting was demonstrated in 15 (83%) of 18 patients. Echocardiographic identification of multiple fenestrations (n = 4) and thrombus within the aneurysm (n = 2) could be achieved for the first time by transesophageal ultrasound application. Cerebrovascular events occurred in 12 (52%) of 23 patients and were regarded as being definitely thromboembolic in 10 (43%); 8 (67%) of the 12 patients had repeated cerebral events. Except for mitral valve prolapse in one patient, no other potential cardiac source of embolism could be identified despite the use of transesophageal echocardiography. A thickening of the aneurysmal membrane greater than or equal to 5 mm was found in 9 (75%) of 12 patients with versus 3 (27%) of 11 patients without a cerebrovascular event (p less than 0.05); this proved to be the only significant difference between the two patient groups. The mechanism of embolization may be both primary thrombus formation within the aneurysm and paradoxic embolization through an interatrial communication as demonstrated by the findings in two patients. It is concluded that atrial septal aneurysm is a cardiac abnormality with thromboembolic potential. In patients with this lesion and a history of an embolic event, long-term anticoagulant therapy is indicated.\r"

The transesophageal study correctly identified and classified 19 of 19 shunts in contrast to 16 of 18 shunts identified by the transthoracic approach. The area of the atrial septal defect was calculated by assuming it to be circular and taking the maximal Doppler color flow jet width at the defect site as its diameter. The pulsed Doppler sample volume was placed parallel to the shunt flow direction at the defect site to obtain the mean velocity and flow duration. From these values, the shunt volume was calculated as a product of the defect area, mean velocity, flow duration and heart rate. The calculated shunt flow volume obtained by transesophageal study showed a good correlation with shunt flow volume (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) obtained at cardiac catheterization. The size of the defect by transesophageal Doppler color flow mapping correlated fairly well with the size estimated at surgery (r = 0.73, p = 0.004). It is concluded that transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging is useful in the detection and classification of atrial septal defects and in the assessment of shunt volumes.\r"

Accordingly, this study compared the clinical course and mortality rate for up to 1 year in a large multicenter data base that included 702 patients greater than 75 years of age (mean +/- SD 81 +/- 4 years), with a less elderly subset of 1,321 patients between 65 and 75 years of age (mean 70 +/- 3 years). The postdischarge 1 year cardiac mortality rate was 17.6% for those greater than 75 years of age compared with 12.0% for patients between 65 and 75 years of age (p less than 0.01). There were differences in the prevalence of several factors, including female gender, history of angina pectoris, history of congestive heart failure, smoking habits and incidence of congestive heart failure during hospitalization. Multivariate analyses of predictors of cardiac death in hospital survivors selected different factors as important in the two age subgroups; age was selected in the 65 to 75 year age group but was not an independent predictor in the very elderly. The survival curves beginning at day 10 for patients 65 to 75 and in those greater than 75 years old were similar for up to 90 days but diverged later. In the very elderly, 63% of late cardiac deaths were sudden or due to new myocardial infarction, similar to the causes of 67% of deaths in the younger age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The applications for coronary angioplasty have greatly expanded and the procedure is now increasingly used in complex and potentially high risk conditions. This report describes the short- and long-term effects of coronary angioplasty in 61 patients with severely depressed left ventricular function (ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) with unstable or refractory anginal symptoms, or both, in whom revascularization was necessary despite increased risk. In a retrospective analysis of 1,260 patients undergoing angioplasty between January 1985 through December 1987, 61 had an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%. The common clinical presentation was unstable angina (70%) with or without recent myocardial infarction. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 27 +/- 6%. Forty-five patients (74%) had multivessel disease. Clinical success after angioplasty was achieved in 55 patients (90%). Major complications (death, infarction and emergency bypass surgery) occurred in five patients (8.2%), with death in two (3.2%). During long-term (mean 21 +/- 11 months) follow-up study of the 55 patients with successful angioplasty, 13 (23%) died, including 3 of noncardiac causes, and 11 (20%) had clinically symptomatic recurrence. Continued clinical success was present in 39 patients (71%), of whom 28 (51%) were event-free patients and 11 (20%) had clinical recurrence; a successful second angioplasty procedure was performed in 9 because of restenosis. Thus, in patients with depressed left ventricular function, coronary angioplasty can be performed with a short-term success rate comparable to that of routine angioplasty or surgical procedures. However, acute complications are more frequent and the late mortality rate is higher than in patients with less depressed function.\r"

Angioplasty was successful in 84%, unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 11% and complicated by one or more major cardiac events in 5% (myocardial infarction 5%, emergency bypass surgery 2% and death 0.2%). Follow-up data were obtained in 99% of 356 patients with successful angioplasty. At a mean of 33 +/- 26 months, 92% were alive, 73% had improvement in angina and 61% were free of angina.

Repeat angioplasty was performed in 27%, with a success rate of 89% and no deaths. Initial success rates were equal in native vessel versus graft angioplasty, but late outcome was less favorable with the latter because of a higher rate of infarction (11% versus 4%, p less than 0.05) and need for reoperation (19% versus 10%, p less than 0.05). The initial success rate was higher in vein grafts less than 1 year old compared with grafts 1 to 4 years or greater than 4 years after operation (92% versus 85% versus 83%, respectively) and adverse late events were less frequent after angioplasty in recent vein grafts (less than 1 year 13%, 1 to 4 years 35%, greater than 4 years 29%; less than 1 versus greater than 1 year, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, patients presenting with class III dyspnea had a 1 year mortality rate of 36%, significantly higher than that of control subjects (p less than 0.003). Of the echocardiographic variables, indexed left atrial size was most strongly associated with reduced survival (p less than 0.008). These results suggest that the prognosis of elderly patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is generally favorable. Certain clinical and echocardiographic variables appear to be of use in identifying patients with a less favorable prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Magnesium abnormalities are common in patients with congestive heart failure but the clinical and prognostic significance of an abnormal serum magnesium concentration in this disorder has not been investigated. Therefore, the relation between serum magnesium concentration and the clinical characteristics and long-term outcome of 199 patients with chronic heart failure was evaluated. The serum magnesium concentration was less than 1.6 mEq/liter in 38 patients (19%), within the normal range in 134 patients (67%) and greater than 2.1 mEq/liter in 27 patients (14%). Patients with hypomagnesemia had more frequent ventricular premature complexes and episodes of ventricular tachycardia than did patients with a normal serum magnesium concentration (p less than 0.05). Even though the two groups were similar with respect to severity of heart failure and neurohormonal variables, patients with a low serum magnesium concentration had a significantly worse prognosis during long-term follow-up (45% versus 71% 1 year survival, p less than 0.05). Patients with hypermagnesemia had more severe symptoms, greater neurohormonal activation and worse renal function than did patients with a normal serum magnesium concentration but tended to have fewer ventricular arrhythmias. Hypermagnesemic patients had a worse prognosis than did those with a normal magnesium concentration (37% versus 71% 1 year survival, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, the measurement of serum magnesium concentration provides important clinical and prognostic information in patients with chronic heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "To precisely define the incidence, type and consequences of cardiac arrhythmias early after heart transplantation, 25 cardiac transplant recipients were monitored continuously for 728 days from the day of surgery to discharge or death. A subset of 15 patients had sinus node function studies with overdrive suppression performed weekly at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. Results revealed sinus bradycardia in 10 patients (40%) and junctional bradycardia in 6 (24%). Supraventricular tachycardia in the form of atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 11 patients (44%). Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 15 patients (60%) and was nonsustained in all. Cardiac pacing for 1,403 h was used in nine patients with a pulse rate less than 50 beats/min; seven recovered and permanent pacing was instituted in two. In the subgroup that had sinus node function studies, seven patients were identified with clinical bradyarrhythmia; each had abnormal sinus node recovery time (greater than 1,400 ms) and abnormal corrected sinus node recovery time (greater than 525 ms) in at least one study. These seven patients also had a significantly prolonged ischemic time (236 +/- 26 versus 159 +/- 68 min, p less than 0.01). In conclusion, cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia and bradyarrhythmia, occur more commonly early after orthotopic heart transplantation than has previously been reported. Sinus node dysfunction due to prolonged organ ischemic time, antiarrhythmic drug use or surgical trauma, alone or in combination, may contribute to these arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The recent development of the VEST, an ambulatory radionuclide detector, to measure left ventricular ejection fraction may enhance the detection of ischemia during daily activities in patients with coronary artery disease. The normal range and determinants of ejection fraction responses to stimuli other than physical exercise, however, are not adequately characterized. Therefore, ejection fraction responses to various activities were measured in 18 normal subjects utilizing the VEST. Uniform increases (greater than 5%) in ejection fraction were seen during physical exercise, uniform decreases were seen during cold pressor testing and modest changes (including decreases greater than 5%) were seen in ejection fraction during mental stress, micturition and hyperventilation. Different forms of stress produced significantly different changes in ejection fraction, even when values were controlled for changes in heart rate. Ventricular loading conditions in the form of enhanced blood pressure responses during mental stress may have contributed to the relatively smaller changes in ejection fraction compared with those during exercise. Subjects demonstrating a decrease in ejection fraction during mental stress did not differ from other subjects in hemodynamic reactivity during mental testing but did have evidence of increased parasympathetic tone during cold pressor and bicycle exercise testing. The results reveal that normal ejection fraction response differs among varying physiologic stimuli. These changes are in part related to changes in heart rate and blood pressure; however, other factors, such as neurohumoral regulation, may also play a role. These findings indicate that the patient's activity and the setting in which it occurs must be considered when interpreting ambulatory ejection fraction responses.\r"

In this study, a new quadripolar contact electrode catheter designed for simultaneous pacing and monophasic action potential recording at closely adjacent sites (2 mm separation between recording electrodes and pacing electrodes) was tested in five closed chest dogs and four patients. Dog studies: Pacing thresholds were extremely low, ranging from 0.02 to 0.25 mA (mean +/- SD 0.099 +/- 0.051, n = 36) and were stable over time (less than 20% increase during 1 h of continuous pacing). Because of the close proximity of pacing and recording electrodes, the pacing artifact nearly coincided with the monophasic action potential upstroke. Because of the low pacing threshold, however, pacing artifacts were small (33 +/- 17% of the monophasic action potential amplitude at twice diastolic threshold strength) and did not affect the duration or configuration of the simultaneously recorded monophasic action potential. The short stimulus response time and the undisturbed monophasic action potential signal fidelity during pacing allowed precise simultaneous measurements of action potential duration and effective refractory period at the same endocardial site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With use of a coronary sinus catheter electrode, a right ventricular catheter electrode and a chest wall patch electrode system, defibrillation threshold voltage, current and energy were measured with four distinct transvenous defibrillation techniques delivered in random sequence in each of 12 survivors of cardiac arrest immediately before implantation of a standard epicardial patch defibrillation system. The four transvenous defibrillation techniques were 1) single pathway monophasic pulsing, 2) single pathway biphasic pulsing, 3) dual pathway sequential pulsing, and 4) dual pathway simultaneous pulsing. A transvenous defibrillation method was considered to be potentially useful only if the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 500 V (less than or equal to 15 J delivered energy). The 500 V value would allow a 2:1 defibrillation safety margin for a device with a maximal output of 30 J. No single transvenous pulsing technique was uniformly superior in efficacy. However, by choosing the best pulsing technique for each patient, it was possible to obtain an average defibrillation threshold of 410 +/- 135 V leading edge voltage, 7.2 +/- 2.5 A leading edge current and 11.3 +/- 7.4 J delivered energy for the group of 12 patients. With the ability to vary defibrillation technique, transvenous antiarrhythmic device implantation would have been possible in 10 (83%) of the 12 patients at or below a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point. In contrast, if only one transvenous defibrillation method had been used, as few as 5 and at most 8 of the 12 patients would have been candidates for a transvenous defibrillation system given a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point for insertion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patient diagnoses were transposition of the great arteries (n = 20), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 38), coarctation of the aorta (n = 24), complete atrioventricular (AV) canal (n = 15), atrial septal defect (n = 8), ventricular septal defects (n = 3), pulmonary stenosis (n = 4), aortic stenosis (n = 8) and subaortic stenosis (n = 9). In arterial tract stenosis, there was high correlation between Doppler estimates and catheterization-derived measurements of residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in patients after the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries (r = 0.95) as well as in patients after corrective repair of tetralogy of Fallot (r = 0.84). In semilunar/AV valve regurgitation, graded as none, mild, moderate or severe, echocardiographic estimates correlated exactly with angiographic grading in 84% and differed by one angiographic grade in the other 16%. In residual left to right shunting, no hemodynamically significant shunt was missed by echocardiography. For residual shunts at the ventricular level (n = 32), addition of Doppler color flow imaging improved the sensitivity (from 63% to 94%) and the negative predictive value (from 88% to 98%). In elevated right ventricular pressure, Doppler-derived right ventricular-right atrial pressure estimates in 24 patients correlated well with catheterization measurements (r = 0.93). Combined two-dimensional and Doppler color flow echocardiography was highly accurate in the prospective evaluation of these four types of postoperative residual.\r"

In 6 of 7 patients with a residual defect requiring immediate surgical revision, intraoperative imaging correctly identified the defect; spectral Doppler imaging underestimated or did not identify a residual outflow tract gradient in 17 patients. Left atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation after repair of complete AV septal defect was underestimated in three patients. Although intraoperative documentation of good ventricular function was usually associated with a good outcome, in three patients poor systemic ventricular function after cardiopulmonary bypass was not associated with early mortality. A minor degree of shunting around the patch was a common finding on epicardial and early postoperative imaging and persisted at the time of hospital discharge in 17 of 46 patients who had undergone patch closure of a ventricular septal defect as part of the surgical procedure. Additional trabecular septal defects were missed on color flow imaging after cardiopulmonary bypass in three patients, one of whom required subsequent reoperation. Although intraoperative two-dimensional and color flow imaging permitted the recognition of the majority of residual defects requiring immediate revision, residual outflow obstruction or AV valve regurgitation was usually underestimated.\r"

The subjects had demonstrated increased exercise duration in response to oral isosorbide dinitrate therapy and absence of complete tolerance to long-term three times daily isosorbide dinitrate. Treadmill exercise to onset of angina was performed over 2 days at 8 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM, 2 PM, 4 PM, 6 PM and 7 PM. On one day each patient received isosorbide dinitrate at 8 AM, 1 PM and 6 PM in a previously titrated dose (mean 27.5 mg), which had been taken three times daily for at least 2 weeks. On the other day at the same hours each patient received double blind a placebo identical in appearance to isosorbide dinitrate.

At each site, save for fat, myocardial desethylamiodarone concentration was higher than amiodarone concentration. Greater intraindividual variability was observed in myocardial desethylamiodarone compared with amiodarone concentration particularly in septal and scar tissue (p = NS). No significant relation was found between myocardial concentration and duration of treatment. In patients with significant ventricular disease, usefulness of plasma amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentration to estimate myocardial concentration is limited by intra- and interindividual variability.\r"

  ".W": "Distal intracoronary infusion of the perfluorochemical Fluosol-DA 20% has been shown to prevent systolic dysfunction during coronary artery balloon occlusion in coronary angioplasty. To assess its effect on global diastolic dysfunction, a randomized, single-blind, crossover protocol comparing intracoronary infusion of Fluosol or no infusion (control) was performed during 60 s balloon inflations in 10 patients (mean age 67 years) undergoing coronary angioplasty. Assessment of global systolic and diastolic function was obtained with high fidelity micromanometer measurements of left ventricular pressure. Eighteen pairs of balloon inflations (Fluosol versus control) were analyzed. Patients reported significantly less severe chest pain during inflations accompanied by Fluosol compared with control. However, during coronary balloon occlusion, no significant differences in the changes from baseline values were observed between Fluosol and control with regard to ventricular relaxation, including the time constant of early ventricular relaxation (tau) and maximal rate of fall in left ventricular pressure (maximal negative dP/dt). No differences between Fluosol and control were observed in terms of the increase in end-diastolic pressure or minimal diastolic pressure during balloon inflation. Mean systolic pressure decrease from baseline values was greater during control than during Fluosol inflations (-9.0 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, p = 0.013), but no significant difference was observed in the change in maximal rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (maximal positive dP/dt). These results suggest that Fluosol does not preserve global left ventricular diastolic function during coronary balloon occlusion, possibly because of its limited oxygen delivery capability relative to arterial blood.\r"

  ".W": "The early (after 21 days) and late (after 4 months) effects of continuous treatment with captopril on left ventricular performance, weight and volumes were studied in rats with myocardial infarction. Early effects were examined in rats subjected to coronary ligation and randomized to either immediate treatment with captopril (2 g/liter drinking water) starting 2 h after surgery or no treatment. After 21 days, the treated group showed reductions in mean arterial, left ventricular systolic and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures compared with untreated rats. Right and left ventricular weight and left ventricular volumes were decreased and the ejection fraction index was increased by captopril treatment. To study the late effects of captopril, a second group of rats was randomized to immediate captopril treatment (starting 2 h after surgery), delayed captopril treatment (starting 21 days after surgery) or no treatment. When studied after 4 months of treatment, rats started on captopril treatment 2 h after infarction showed no differences compared with rats started on treatment 21 days after infarction. Treatment with captopril for 4 months produced changes that were similar to those in rats treated for 21 days. Captopril treatment improved hemodynamic function after myocardial infarction in rats examined after either 21 days or 4 months of treatment. The extent of the benefit was similar in the two treatment periods. Initiation of captopril therapy immediately after infarction did not appear to produce a greater effect than treatment started at 21 days after infarction in rats studied after the drug had been administered for 4 months.\r"

  ".W": "Heart rate variability has been demonstrated both experimentally and clinically to be of prognostic importance in determining mortality after myocardial infarction. However, no paired studies have been reported to examine heart rate variability before and after myocardial infarction. The hypothesis was tested that low values of heart rate variability provided risk assessment both before and after myocardial infarction with use of an established canine model of sudden cardiac death. Risk for sudden death was assessed 1 month after myocardial infarction by a protocol in which exercise and myocardial ischemia were combined; dogs that developed ventricular fibrillation were classified at high risk for sudden death (susceptible) and the survivors were considered low risk (resistant). In resistant dogs, myocardial infarction did not affect any measure of heart rate variability: 1) mean RR interval, 2) standard deviation of the mean RR interval, and 3) the coefficient of variance (standard deviation/RR interval). By contrast, after myocardial infarction, susceptible dogs showed significant decrease in all measures of heart rate variability. Before myocardial infarction, no differences were seen between susceptible and resistant dogs. However, 30 days after infarction, epidemiologic analysis of the coefficient of variance showed high sensitivity and specificity (88% and 80%, respectively), predicting susceptibility. Therefore, results of analysis of 30 min of beat to beat heart period at rest 30 days after myocardial infarction are highly predictive for increased risk of sudden death.\r"

  ".U": "91010339\r", 
  ".W": "Quantitation of myocardial contraction requires a frame of reference. Most investigators have sought a single reference frame per image, centered in some manner with respect to the mass of myocardium. Because there is no anatomic marker for the center of the heart, many different approaches have been pursued to identify a centroid of the left ventricle. The issue of whether the reference should be fixed throughout the cardiac cycle or float from image to image has been addressed in previous studies, but the more fundamental question of how a centroid can best be defined has not been answered. This study examines this basic issue by analysis of variance from observer to observer, cycle to cycle, animal to animal and method to method. Both endocardial and epicardial borders were digitized twice by each of two observers at 1/30 s intervals spanning the cardiac cycle for each of three cardiac cycles in six normal dogs. The left ventricular centroid was calculated by six methods: center of endocardial coordinates, center of epicardial coordinates, center of mid-myocardial (average) coordinates, center of endocardial area, center of epicardial area and center of mid-myocardial (average) area. The path of each centroid was correlated between observers and correlation coefficients were transformed for analysis of variance. This analysis indicates a best approach to centroid definition through distinct minimization of the variance: the best of the six methods proved to be center of endocardial area.\r"

  ".W": "Although two-dimensional echocardiography is widely used in both clinical and experimental evaluations of regional cardiac wall motion, there is no established clinical method for quantitative analysis of the wall motion, not even for the normal radial motion observed in short-axis images. Measurement of radial wall motion requires determination of a centroid from which the radii emanate. Depending on its definition, the centroid is variously affected throughout systole by cardiac translation, regional wall motion and any shift of the subject position or transducer. A floating centroid is defined relative to the ventricular walls frame by frame, whereas a fixed centroid never moves with respect to the transducer. Evaluation of the best approach to definition of a centroid was previously presented (part I, this issue). The next question is how to use the centroid. This study examines which of four centroid applications provides the best reference for quantifying regional wall motion during systole. Method 1 is a floating centroid (defined separately for every image frame), method 2 uses the end-diastolic centroid as a fixed reference for all image frames, method 3 uses the end-systolic centroid as a fixed reference and method 4 uses the average as a fixed reference. Wall motion was measured with respect to each of these centroids by determining radial wall motion from end-diastole to end-systole and correlating radial motion throughout the cardiac cycle with that in normal control hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied nine subjects with mild asthma by bronchoalveolar lavage before and 48 (one subject) to 72 (eight subjects) hours after antigen bronchoprovocation and compared airspace cell numbers and types, cell function, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, albumin, and immunoglobulins. Mild, but significant, airflow limitation persisted at the time of the second lavage. Eosinophil influx was a notable component of the increased airspace cells in postchallenge lavages. Airspace cells demonstrated significantly enhanced ROS metabolism, and total protein, albumin, and IgM levels were higher in postchallenge lavage specimens. Antigen bronchial challenge produces airspace inflammation, which may develop, in part, as a consequence of enhanced ROS metabolism of airspace cells.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the study was to determine the effect of cetirizine, a new potent H1 antihistamine, on acute cutaneous inflammatory response and eosinophil accumulation induced in vivo by platelet-activating-factor (PAF-acether) and allergen. In a double-blind, crossover study, seven subjects allergic to grass pollen and three nonallergic control subjects received orally either cetirizine, 20 mg/day, or placebo for 4 days. On day 4, the subjects were skin tested with grass pollen and PAF-acether (400 and 40 ng per site). After the challenge, an evaluation of time-course cutaneous eosinophil infiltrations by a skin window technique was performed. Cetirizine pretreatment reduced skin wheal and erythema elicited by allergen and PAF, 400 and 40 ng, by 74.6% (p less than 0.001), 53.9% (p less than 0.001), and 47% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Skin reactivity induced by PAF-acether was also significantly reduced by cetirizine in nonallergic subjects. Cetirizine reduced at hour 24 eosinophil infiltrations induced by allergen and PAF, 400 and 40 ng, by 63% (p less than 0.001), 58.5% (p less than 0.001), and 57.8% (p less than 0.01), respectively. This inhibitory effect of cetirizine on allergen and PAF-induced eosinophil infiltration was already effective 2 hours after the challenge. PAF induced a nonsignificant eosinophil influx in all nonallergic subjects. In conclusion, cetirizine inhibited both the immediate cutaneous response and the eosinophil influx induced by allergen and by a potent eosinophil chemotactic factor, such as PAF-acether. Therefore, cetirizine, besides its anti-H1 effect, has the potential to modulate the allergic inflammatory response.\r"

Two patients were dermatographic and yielded indeterminate skin test results. Eleven of the 27 patients subsequently had GA; all patients received a premedication regimen of prednisone and diphenhydramine. Of three patients with negative skin tests, one experienced an arrhythmia, but no other signs attributable to anaphylaxis were noted. One patient with dermatographism had GA without a reaction. Positive skin tests implicated an agent that was avoided in seven patients; one of these patients experienced delayed urticaria/angioedema after the completion of GA. Thus, no patients developed anaphylaxis during subsequent GA for which agents producing positive skin tests were avoided, and a premedication regimen was used.\r"

  ".W": "The role of soluble fragments of CD23 and their relationship to interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the in vitro production of IgE by normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was examined. Most donors' cells were induced to produce IgE in vitro by IL-4 during a 9- to 21-day culture. This stimulation was not observed in the absence of T cells. Inability of IL-4 to induce IgE in nonresponding cultures was associated with a failure to express CD23 on Lev-19+ natural killer cells; CD23 expression on B cells and monocytes was equivalent in responding and nonresponding subjects. Concentrated supernatants from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines containing soluble fragments (sCD23) of the low-affinity Fc epsilon R (Fc epsilon R-II, CD23) induced IgE from all donors' cells in the absence of T cells. The sCD23 containing supernatants were demonstrated to be devoid of IL-4, and their effect could not be abrogated by anti-IL-4. IgE induction by both IL-4 and sCD23-containing supernatant were blocked by anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody. Affinity absorption of sCD23 removed the IgE-inducing activity. The cells most responsive to the sCD23 material were small, resting B cells rather than large in vivo activated cells. IL-4 synergized with sCD23-containing supernatant in the T cell-depleted cultures, and limiting dilution analyses demonstrated that IL-4 caused a more than tenfold increase in the precursor frequency of cells capable of responding to sCD23-containing supernatant with IgE production. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that IL-4 has multiple effects in the ultimate induction of human IgE including (1) commitment of B cells to IgE and (2) the generation of natural killer cell sCD23 fragments that subsequently drive IgE-committed cells to IgE synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) induces bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma, probably caused by histamine release from airway mast cells, and repeated AMP bronchial challenge leads to attenuation of the bronchoconstrictor response. Since exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may be mediated by hypertonic mast cell degranulation, we postulated that repeated AMP bronchial challenge should reduce the response to subsequent exercise challenge. Eight atopic subjects with asthma took part in an unblinded, randomized trial. On the control study day, a treadmill exercise test previously demonstrated to induce a greater than 20% fall in FEV1 was performed. On the AMP study day, three AMP dose-response bronchial challenges were performed at 1-hour intervals. Each AMP challenge was continued until either a provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 had been achieved (PC20) and the PC20 was calculated, or the maximum concentration of AMP (400 mg/ml) had been administered. After recovery of the FEV1 from AMP challenge, a treadmill exercise test identical to the test on the control study day was performed. On the AMP study day, the geometric mean PC20 was 15.3 (7.9 to 29.5) mg/ml for the first test, and 28.2 (10.7 to 77.4) mg/ml for the third test (not significant). On the control study day, the mean maximum percentage fall in FEV1 after exercise was 28.0% +/- 2.7%, whereas on the AMP study day, it was reduced to 13.0% +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.01). A significant correlation was found between the change in responsiveness to AMP induced by repeated challenge and the attenuation of the subsequent exercise response (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine if basophils were responsible for the persistent release of histamine during continuous antigen (Ag) administration in the skin, we compared the release of histamine, tryptase, and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) at sites of continuous (5 hours) and intermittent Ag and codeine skin-chamber challenge in the skin of 16 atopic and four nonatopic subjects. In addition, we compared the release of these three mediators at sites of continuous Ag challenge in five subjects during oral administration of 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone. Continuous Ag challenge induced an initial (first hour) peak of histamine release followed by a lower level plateau of histamine release during the next 4 hours. The level of histamine release during the second to fifth hours was significantly higher at these sites of continuous Ag challenge than at the codeine- or intermittent Ag-challenge sites. Levels of both tryptase and PGD2 were increased after the first hour of Ag or codeine challenge, and tryptase decreased progressively thereafter at all sites. In corticosteroid-treated subjects, the persistent histamine release during the second to fifth hours of Ag challenge was significantly reduced. In contrast, corticosteroid therapy did not affect histamine release during the first hour of Ag challenge nor the release of PGD2 or tryptase at any time period. These findings suggest that basophils are the source of the persistent histamine release at sites of continuous in vivo Ag challenge, since such release (1) was unaccompanied by release of tryptase or PGD2 (released from mast cells but not basophils), (2) did not occur after codeine challenge that activates mast cells but not basophils, and (3) was inhibited by steroids that inhibit the accumulation and release of histamine from basophils but not mast cells.\r"

There was no significant correlation between the first-hour and second- to fifth-hour histamine release. With a combination of basophil, antigen, histamine, and codeine skin sensitivity and reactivity, 64% to 75% of the magnitude of the first-hour, second- to fifth-hour, and total (0 to 5 hours) skin chamber histamine release could be accounted for.

INTERVENTIONS: 200 micrograms of aqueous beclomethasone diproprionate nasal spray, twice daily, from 1 week before until 1 week after the ragweed-pollen season (regular) or 100 micrograms of the spray, taken as required, up to 400 micrograms daily; troublesome nasal symptoms were treated, in both groups, by increasing the daily dose to 800 micrograms until symptoms were controlled. If this treatment was insufficient, 120 mg of terfenadine, daily, was added. RESULTS: One subject in the \"as required\"-treated group withdrew with uncontrolled nasal symptoms. In the remaining subjects, sneezing, stuffy nose, and rhinorrhea, measured by a daily diary, were significantly better controlled in the regular-treated group (p less than 0.025). Impairment of quality of life, including sleep disturbance, nonhay fever symptoms, practical problems, and uncomfortable emotions were greater in the as required-treated group (p less than 0.001). Subjects in the regular-treated group required less additional terfenadine (0.27 tablets per subject versus 1.40; p = 0.022). Eye symptoms and eye-drop use were similar in the two treated groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, regular use of inhaled steroids results in fewer symptoms and better quality of life than when the spray is taken only as required.\r"

The observation that shrimp-sensitive individuals in general have increased levels of circulating shrimp-specific IgG is of interest because antigen/allergen-specific IgG subclasses have been associated with adverse reactions to foods. Therefore, this current study measured shrimp-specific IgG subclass and IgE antibodies in 31 individuals with histories of immediate, adverse reactions to shrimp immediately before DBPCFC and 20 shrimp-tolerant subjects. Individuals with a history of shrimp sensitivity had significantly raised shrimp-specific IgG2 and IgG4 compared to shrimp-tolerant individuals. Challenge-positive subjects were distinguished from subjects with negative or equivocal responses by an increased IgG2 (p less than or equal to 0.001). Specific IgG4 was not raised (p less than or equal to 0.065). These studies indicate that some shrimp-specific IgG subclass levels are increased in shrimp-sensitive subjects. However, none of the subclass responses were significantly predictive of a positive response to DBPCFC and therefore were not diagnostic of shrimp intolerance.\r"

  ".U": "91010376\r", 
  ".W": "An ELISA was developed to detect specific IgE antibody to the Bacillus subtilis-derived proteolytic detergent enzyme, subtilisin A (Alcalase), in sera from exposed detergent workers. Workers in the detergent industry are exposed via inhalation to low levels of the enzyme dust in the presence of detergent dust. Chemically inactivated Alcalase was used as the test antigen. Significant binding of IgE antibody to the immobilized enzyme was detected in the ELISA. The binding of allergic antibody to Alcalase was specifically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by preincubating sera with 0.1 to 100 micrograms of inactivated Alcalase. Binding of IgE antibody to Alcalase could not be inhibited by two other inactivated bacterial proteases, Savinase and Esperase, derived from different Bacillus species. ELISA and skin test results demonstrated total agreement for 27 of 31 samples (87%), whereas RAST and skin test results demonstrated total agreement for only 24 of 31 samples (77%), indicating that the ELISA was more sensitive than the RAST. We conclude that the ELISA is a sensitive, fast, alternative to the RAST for detection of Alcalase-specific IgE antibody in detergent enzyme-exposed workers.\r"

Male children of smoking parents had a significantly higher total count and percentage of eosinophils (p = 0.008) and higher IgE levels (p = 0.01) than male children of nonsmoking parents. Prevalence of eosinophilia (defined as greater than or equal to 4% of total white blood cell count) was significantly correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked by parents among boys (p = 0.003) but not among girls (p = 0.20). There was a significant trend (p = 0.008) for prevalence of eosinophilia to increase with increasing levels of serum IgE. For any given level of serum IgE, the frequency of eosinophilia was higher among children of smoking parents than among children of nonsmoking parents. When parental smoking was studied in a multivariable analysis and after controlling for the other variable, it was still significantly associated with eosinophilia in the children of these smoking parents but not with serum IgE levels. We conclude that parental smoking is associated with a significant enhancement of the expression of the most important markers of allergic sensitization in the children of smoking parents. This is particularly evident for boys and may explain, at least in part, the increased frequency of respiratory symptoms in children of smoking parents.\r"

A total of 166 SRs occurred in 144 patients (4.5% of all patients) or 3.0 SRs occurred per 1000 injection visits. Sixty-eight patients were taking BB drugs throughout the year, and only one patient had an SR. By chance, 3.08 patients were expected to have had SRs. We conclude that BB drugs did not increase the frequency of SRs in the patients studied who were receiving immunotherapy (p greater than 0.95). Patients taking BB drugs may still be at increased risk, however, from more severe SRs or their SRs may be more refractory to therapy.\r"

Data on the adequacy of the diets and the nutritional status of homeless persons are sparse. Therefore, we surveyed the nutritional adequacy of the dietary intake, the quality of shelter meals, and objective clinical parameters indicative of nutritional status in a heterogeneous group of urban homeless persons. The group comprised mentally ill persons, alcohol and illicit drug users, and temporarily unemployed persons. Although 86 of the 96 subjects (90%) in our survey reported that they obtained enough to eat, a low dietary adequacy score, which was based on the basic four food groups, of 10.7 (norm = 16) indicated that the quality of their diets was inadequate. Shelter meals and diet records showed a high level of saturated fat and cholesterol. Serum cholesterol levels above the desirable limit of 5.17 mmol/L (200 mg) were observed in 79 subjects (82%). In addition to a prevalence of hypertension and obesity (observed in 37 subjects [39%], these homeless persons were at high risk for development of or worsening of cardiovascular disease. We conclude that homeless persons who obtain meals at shelters are getting enough to eat. However, the shelter meals should be modified to meet the nutritional needs and dietary prescriptions of the large number of clients who suffer from various health disorders.\r"

The sample consisted of 45 students in diet therapy courses, 46 dietetic interns, and 44 experienced clinical or generalist dietitians. The patient management problem tested data gathering, with sections containing information needed to assess nutritional status, and nutrition care planning, in which subjects identified and evaluated problems and selected short- and long-term goals. Performance was scored by comparing subjects' answers with those of five dietetic experts. Dietitians scored highest and students scored lowest on efficiency of data gathering. Dietitians and interns scored higher than students on proficiency of data gathering and nutrition care planning. Overall, dietitians and interns performed better than students. Only in tasks requiring the highest levels of information processing and/or confidence in clinical judgment were differences between dietitians and interns consistently found. These findings demonstrate that basic nutrition care planning skills are acquired during dietetic internships, but advanced skills are added with clinical experience.\r"

The Index of Organizational Reactions Questionnaire was used to measure specific components of job satisfaction based on a five-point Likert-style scale (1 = low satisfaction, 3 = moderate satisfaction, and 5 = high satisfaction). Questionnaires were mailed to the entire population of 256 foodservice managers employed in college and university dining facilities of a regional division of a major foodservice company in the northeastern United States. Names, titles, positions, and addresses of the managers were obtained from the company's human resources department. Analysis of data was done through computation of the point-biserial correlation coefficient and the rank order correlation coefficient. Managers who responded to the questionnaire (74.6%) indicated moderate overall job satisfaction (mean = 3.42 on a 5-point scale). Of the respondents, 44% had an educational background in foodservice; these respondents had lower overall job satisfaction than did those having no education/training in foodservice. Both groups were most satisfied with the job components of supervision, type of work, and relationship with coworkers. Both groups were least satisfied with pay and benefits, company identification, and amount of work. A significant (p less than .01) positive relationship was found between educational field of study and job satisfaction, and a significant (p less than .001) negative relationship was found between educational level (i.e., degree[s] earned) and job satisfaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Subjects from a large introductory nutrition course were divided into two groups, one that received training on estimating food quantities and one that received no instruction. Training consisted of 10-minute sessions during which subjects passed around and viewed 10 food models labeled with their respective quantities. The trained subjects estimated quantities of six real foods at one of three points in time: immediately after training, 1 week later, or 4 weeks later. Untrained subjects estimated quantities of the same six foods. For all foods combined, trained subjects gave significantly better estimates than untrained subjects, whether estimates were made immediately after training, 1 week later, or 4 weeks later. The estimates of the trained subjects on the day of training and 1 week later were not significantly different, but both were significantly better than estimates made 4 weeks later. In regard to individual food items, trained subjects estimating immediately or 1 week later were always more accurate than untrained subjects. Effects of training disappeared by week 4 for three of the six foods. These results support the use of training, with food models, to improve an individual's ability to estimate food quantities accurately and indicate that the impact of such training lasts for at least 1 week and can last up to 4 weeks. The findings imply that training with periodic reviews may be necessary in a clinical setting to ensure that patients estimate their food consumption accurately.\r"

We discuss specific recommendations for counseling hyperlipidemic patients based on the Dietary Alternatives Study. Recommendations include providing patients with an adequate knowledge base to make dietary changes, using goal setting and self-monitoring to help patients initiate dietary changes, enlisting support from the patient's family, and enhancing self-efficacy to promote long-term dietary maintenance.\r"

Completed questionnaires were received from 66 of 102 (65%) internship directors surveyed. The majority of directors expected only basic preparation for group nutrition education and individual counseling knowledge/skills areas. Internship training in nutrition education competencies was \"moderate\" to \"extensive,\" whereas preparation in nutrition counseling competencies was more likely to be \"extensive.\" Directors perceived the internship to provide adequate preparation in all but the advanced practice skills, such as behavior modification and motivational strategies, for which further preparation was recommended. The majority of internship directors reported that more than 25% of the intern practice experience was in patient counseling, with less experience in group instruction. Implications for undergraduate dietetic education are discussed in relation to internship directors' expectations as well as to present and future trends in the dietetic profession.\r"

Twenty-seven percent of patients had DNR orders. Ninety percent of all patients had potentially available surrogate decisionmakers. However, for 31% of patients with DNR orders, there was no documentation of patient or surrogate participation in the DNR decision. Univariate analysis identified female sex; increased age, level of care (skilled versus intermediate), presence of a potential surrogate decisionmaker, and increasing length of time since nursing home admission as factors associated with presence of DNR orders. When a logistic regression model was used, increased age, increased length of time since nursing home admission, skilled versus intermediate level of care, and presence of a surrogate decisionmaker were independently associated with presence of DNR status. Several variables are independently associated with written DNR orders; their relationship to the factors physicians use in decision making requires further study.\r"

Applied to 26 aged women, 78% of 2,264 devices were leak-free for 24 hours and 49% for 48 hours. The incidence of new bacteriuria was less than half that found in our earlier studies of long-term urethral catheters in the same institution. Perineal erythema was infrequent and preexisting decubitus ulcers improved or did not change. Four patients were withdrawn, one each because of periurethral itching, diminished urine output, recurrent wetness, and fracture of the proximal femur associated with severe osteoporosis. This device may offer an alternative to urethral catheters for management of urinary incontinence but should not be used on women with urine retention and should be used with care on women with severe osteoporosis. Controlled trials must determine effects upon bacteriologic complications and health-care costs.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and selected clinical outcomes of taking to bed among a population of independently ambulating older individuals. It was designed as a retrospective case series and was conducted in the intermediate-care facility of a not-for-profit, teaching nursing home. Our study group was composed of individuals over 65 years of age who became bed bound. Thirty-six taking-to-bed episodes occurred in 36 individuals during one calendar year, giving an incidence of 13 per 1,000 resident-months (95% CI, 4 to 23 per 1,000). Twelve of the 36 died within 3 months, and 17 within 6 months, but almost all who survived regained ambulation. Survival was significantly shorter for the five without localizing symptoms (P less than .05). Orthopedic, neurologic, psychiatric, and iatrogenic conditions were most commonly identified as concurrent medical events. Almost half who took to bed had multiple concurrent medical events, and these residents were more likely to present without localizing symptoms (P less than .05). Twenty-one (58%) of the episodes occurred after a fall. The incidence of taking to bed in this population indicates that clinicians caring for older persons should be alert to its occurrence. The dramatic decline in mobility deserves careful assessment because it initiated a period of relatively rapid change in the health careers of the individuals we studied: almost half died within 6 months, but nearly all who survived regained ambulation. Those without localizing symptoms may have more complex interacting medical problems and a worse prognosis.\r"

In groups R, N, and H, the blood pressure increased in the afternoon and decreased at midnight; in group D, however, although it increased in the afternoon, it did not decrease at night. The circadian changes of the heart rate were similar in all four groups, showing maxima in the afternoon and minima at midnight.

The potential for duplication of analgesic therapy among the elderly is great due to prevalent painful chronic conditions and the variety of prescription and nonprescription analgesic remedies available. The prevalence of multiple analgesic product use and patterns of concurrent use of different analgesic categories was investigated in a geographically defined population of persons 65 years of age and older. The demographic characteristics of users of multiple analgesic drug products were examined, as were their smoking status, alcohol use, lifetime history rates of major illnesses, physical functioning, pain experiences, memory performance, and depressive symptoms. A substantial proportion of analgesic users reported taking multiple products in the preceding 2 weeks (14.4% of female and 10.5% of male analgesic users). Men who reported pain in the preceding year were more likely to use multiple analgesic products. Women who experienced pain or limited physical functioning, or who had higher depressive symptom scores or a life-time history of ulcers were most likely to use multiple analgesic products. Thus, although some users of multiple analgesic products reported significant pain, several other factors were shown to be related to the phenomenon of multiple use.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficacy and gastroduodenal tolerability of imidazole salicylate (imidazole 2-hydroxybenzoate, ITF 182), a new synthetic drug with an anti-inflammatory action, was evaluated endoscopically in comparison with those of piroxicam in elderly patients suffering from osteoarthrosis. Of the 41 patients entering the trial, only 38 completed the protocol (6 men and 32 women; mean age, 71; range, 65-80 years). After upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the purpose of excluding gastric and duodenal mucosal lesions, the patients were allocated at random, according to a double-blind, double-dummy protocol, to treatment either with imidazole salicylate 750 mg three times daily or with piroxicam 20 mg once daily for a period of 4 weeks. Imidazole salicylate proved active in controlling a number of the pain symptoms caused by arthrosis, although its efficacy was inferior to that of piroxicam. Grade 2 gastric mucosal lesions were detected in 1 of 20 patients (5%) treated with imidazole salicylate; lesions corresponding to grades 2, 3, and 4 were found in 6 of 18 (33%) of those treated with piroxicam (P = .034). Painful dyspepsia was reported by 15% of the patients in the imidazole salicylate group and by 28% of those in the piroxicam group. On the basis of these results and under the experimental conditions adopted in this trial, the authors concluded that imidazole salicylate is characterized by good gastric tolerability and can thus be used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases in the elderly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Agreement between first and second interviews was very good; most subjects reported no impairment in function at either interview. Among those who reported some impairment, the degree of limitation within the specific activities reported as limited and the total number of activities with any degree of limitation agreed exactly for most and within one level for almost all subjects. There was no evidence to suggest that age or cognitive impairment affected the variability of the responses, and reported declines and improvements in function were about equally common.\r"

Patients with Alzheimer's disease had a greater preference than normal controls for relatively high-fat, sweet foods and for high-sugar, low-fat foods, but did not significantly differ in preference for other foods, including those high in complex carbohydrates and protein. Vascular dementia patients showed a similar pattern, not significantly different from that for Alzheimer's patients. Results did not consistently support a hypothesis that increased sweet preference is a nonspecific form of disinhibited behavior related to declining mental status, nor was a hypothesis relating sweet preference to serotonin activity within the brain consistently supported. Results provide preliminary evidence that craving for sweet food may be a significant part of the clinical syndrome of dementia, but further research is needed to delineate the psychological and biological mechanisms accounting for it.\r"

Effects of the H2-receptor antagonist sofalcone (2'carboxymethoxy-4,4'-bis 3-methyl-2) and truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty on lectin binding sites and distribution were also investigated. Biotinylated lectins in combination with ABC (avidin-biotinyl peroxidase complex) method were used for light and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled lectins for electron microscopic studies. Gastric mucosal cells showed the specific binding pattern for each lectin by light microscopy. Especially, binding sites and distribution of peanut agglutinin (PNA) were characteristic after induction of stress, truncal vagotomy, and administration of each drug. Staining and distribution increased in the gastric mucosa upward and downward after that. In electron microscopic studies, PNA strongly stained the membranes of the intracellular secretory canaliculi of a parietal cell. These results suggested that alternation of binding sites and distribution was regulated by change of gastric mucosal blood flow and of acidity in the parietal cells. Therefore, increase of glycoconjugate distribution is supposed to be a possibility of cytoprotective effect for a change of environment in the parietal cells.\r"

Exposure of the stomach for 20 min to 2 ml urea (0.025-0.2%) together with urease (100 IU) induced histological damages in a concentration-related manner. Either urea or urease alone did not induce any histological change in the mucosa. Instillation of urea into the stomach generated ammonia in the presence of urease; the amount of ammonia was increased depending on the concentration of urea, and was closely associated with the severity of histological damage. The exposure of the stomach to ammonia (NH4OH: 0.01-0.1%) also produced histological damages in the gastric mucosa in a concentration-related manner. The characteristics of injury induced by 0.5-1.0% ammonia were stasis of microcirculation, disruption of the surface epithelial cells, and necrosis of the mucosa. These results demonstrated that ammonia generated from the hydrolysis of urea by urease in the stomach causes damages in the gastric mucosa.\r"

However, the mucus that lines the stomach and intestine is an important layer whose properties and functions in electrolyte and solute transport are not well understood. In this study we examined the Na+/H+ exchange of mucus from the stomach body and antrum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Mucus from the stomach body and antrum is a cation exchanger, a property that aids the net unidirectional flux of H+ ions from parietal cells to lumen. In the jejunum and ileum, mucus is an anion exchanger, which may be important in solute transport and absorption in the small bowel. In both the stomach and small bowel, proton movement is slow, which helps maintain the uphill pH gradient across gastric mucus and the downhill pH gradient across small intestinal mucus.\r"

The amount of incorporation was 25.4 +/- 5.9 pmol/mg DNA in control rats, 11.7 +/- 3.8 pmol/mg DNA in PGE2-administered rats, 6.2 +/- 5.6 pmol/mg DNA in pirenzepine-administered rats, and 42.9 +/- 14.4 pmol/mg DNA in indomethacin-administered rats. PGE2 and pirenzepine significantly decreased the incorporation as compared with the control group. In contrast, indomethacin increased the incorporation. In addition, gastric mucosa of these drug-treated rats was studied histochemically. PGE2 and pirenzepine increased secretion of gastric mucus whereas indomethacin decreased it. It is possible that gastric mucus has a protective effect not only against ulcerogenic agents but also against carcinogens. It is considered that gastric mucus plays an important role in the defense mechanism against carcinogenesis.\r"

Furthermore, quantitative changes in five kinds of prostaglandins (PGs) in the gastric mucosa were measured after administration of NSAIDs. Gastric mucus volume was measured using a video image processor (VIP), and five kinds of PGs were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and quantitatively determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). We found that NSAIDs decrease the levels of five kinds of PGs to the same extent. Also, gastric mucous volume is decreased after administration of aspirin and increased after administration of indomethacin. Accordingly, it is possible that each NSAID has a different mechanism of producing the gastric mucosal injury and acts on gastric mucus in a different manner. There was no parallel in changes between gastric mucous volume and PG levels of the different PGs in the gastric mucosa after administration of NSAIDs.\r"

Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori.\r"

The specific question we studied was whether the structure and cellular composition of the gastric mucosa in an area of grossly healed ulcer were fully restored. Eighty Sprague-Dawley rats underwent laparotomy; 100% acetic acid was applied to the lower gastric corpus serosa for 30 s and the abdomen was closed. The stomachs were reopened after 2 weeks or after 2, 3, or 4 months. Standardized gastric wall specimens from the area of grossly healed ulcers were obtained, processed, and evaluated by light microscopy and by transmission electron microscopy. The gastric mucosa of grossly healed ulcers demonstrated re-epithelialization at each study time but the mucosa beneath the surface epithelium displayed prominent histologic and ultrastructural abnormalities. Two different patterns of scar could be distinguished: (a) the mucosa in the area of healed ulcer was thinner (25-45% reduction vs. normal), with increased connective tissue and poor differentiation and/or degenerative changes in the glandular cells; or (b) the mucosa displayed ballooning dilatation of gastric glands, reduction in the microvascular network, and poor differentiation of glandular cells. We conclude that (i) the subepithelial mucosa of grossly healed gastric ulcer displays disorganized restoration of glandular and vascular structures and remains histologically and ultrastructurally abnormal; (ii) these abnormalities may interfere with oxygenation, nutrient supply, and with mucosal resistance and defense, and therefore could be the basis for ulcer recurrence.\r"

Bethanechol (100 microM) or 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP, 1 mM) induced a significant increase in HCO3- secretion. Prostaglandin E2 (1 microM) also produced an increase in HCO3- secretion, although it was less effective than either bethanechol or 8-Br-cAMP. Histamine (100 microM) did not affect HCO3- secretion. This preparation may be suited to the study of the precise mechanisms by which neurohumoral factors regulate gastric HCO3- secretion.\r"

One hundred percent acetic acid was applied to the gastric serosa of 140 fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats through a polyethylene tube for 30 s. Gastric mucosal changes were evaluated at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, 1 and 3 h, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11 days after acetic acid application by visual inspection, by quantitative and qualitative light microscopy, and by transmission electron microscopy. Following exposure to acetic acid, the earliest morphologic changes occurred at 1 min and consisted of dilatation of large submucosal veins and arteries and mucosal collecting venules. Five to 15 minutes after injury, thrombi developed in submucosal veins and collecting venules, leading to microvascular stasis and mucosal necrosis. By 3 h, necrotic masses started to detach. By 24-48 h, necrotic changes penetrated the submucosa. By 72 h, most ulcers underwent transition into a \"chronic\" stage characterized histologically by the presence of granulation tissue at the bottom, and the appearance of a transitional healing zone at the margins. By 5 days, an increased amount of granulation tissue was observed and the gastric glands in transitional zones at the ulcer margin displayed cystic dilatation. Based on this study, we conclude that a key feature of acetic acid-induced ulcer formation is the early vascular and microvascular injury, which precedes glandular cell necrosis.\r"

Although it did not reach any significance, PGD2 also reduced 0.6 N HCl-induced mucosal damage, and slightly reduced 25% NaCl-induced mucosal damage. Topical application of PGD2 did not affect gastric mucosal hemodynamics at steady state before the administration of necrotizing agent. However, PGD2 significantly improved the gastric mucosal microcirculatory congestion caused by ethanol, and partly improved 0.6 N HCl-induced ischemia. However, it did not improve the 25% NaCl-induced mucosal congestion. The results indicated that PGD2 had a protective effect in the ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury through the improvement of gastric mucosal microcirculation. However, further investigations are needed to clarify the precise effect of PGD2 in 0.6 N HCl- or 25% NaCl-induced mucosal damage.\r"

The surface epithelial cells (SECs) accounted for 83% of the isolated gastric mucosal cells, mucus neck cells for 5%, parietal cells for 9%, and chief cells for 3%. To suspensions of SEC, either dm-PGE2 at concentrations of 10(-7), 10(-6), or 10(-5) M or sofalcone at concentrations from 5 X 10(-6) to 10(-4) M was added; some cells were treated with neither drug. Ten minutes later, ethanol was added to each cell suspension to a final concentration of 15%, and 5 min later the viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. At 10(-6) M, dm-PGE2 reduced ethanol-induced cell damage most strongly (p less than 0.001). Sofalcone also helped to prevent cell damage caused by ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that dm-PGE2 and sofalcone protect gastric mucosa not only from gross visible damage but they directly protect gastric cells from damage.\r"

Morphometric observation revealed that, with TCA treatment, mucosal thickness, parietal cell mass, and the ratios of the length of the glandular portion/total length of the gastric gland were decreased in both the fundic and pyloric glands. Inflammatory cell infiltration and collagenous fiber proliferation were present in the gastric mucosa following TCA and indicated the presence of atrophic gastritis. These atrophic changes and inflammatory cell infiltration were reversed by a 3 week administration of sofalcone. Cellular proliferative activity assessed by the labeling indices of the gastric mucosa increased in TCA-induced gastritis in rats. The administration of sofalcone to rats with TCA-induced gastritis significantly increased labeling indices, particularly in the pyloric glands. From these results, it appears that sofalcone stimulates the compensatory increase in proliferative activity of generative cells, which then may become available to heal the gastritis.\r"

This effect of EGF occurs without reducing gastric acid secretion. On the other hand, EGF reportedly is excreted rapidly from gastric lumen when administered by intragastric bolus. This suggests that further stimulation of ulcer healing may be expected if EGF is given with an acid-suppressive agent or with an agent allowing EGF to remain in rat gastric lumen at high concentrations. In the present study, EGF administered by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which is three times smaller than reported in previous studies, was evaluated for its effect on acetic acid-induced rat gastric ulcers in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole. Sucralfate is well known selectively to bind proteins covering the ulcer base, and omeprazole is a potent acid-suppressive agent. Prior to the study of combined EGF and sucralfate, oral sucralfate was confirmed to allow endogenous gastric EGF and mouse EGF given exogenously to remain at high concentrations in gastric contents and tissues. EGF and sucralfate (2 g/kg/day) given alone failed to stimulate ulcer healing in submandibularectomized rats (SMR rat) whose endogenous gastric EGF was depleted. However, the combination of both drugs administered at the same doses significantly accelerated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. Omeprazole (200 mg/kg/day) significantly enhanced ulcer healing regardless of removal of the submandibular glands. The combination of EGF and omeprazole further stimulated ulcer healing in the SMR rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The bicarbonate secretion was measured by continuous titration of recirculating luminal perfusate. In artificially ventilated rabbits, intermittent exposure to cigarette smoke during two 10-min periods caused a marked (approximately 40%) decrease (p less than 0.01) in duodenal bicarbonate secretion. After the exposures, secretion gradually recovered and had returned to the pre-exposure rate after 50 min. The decrease in secretion was associated with decreases in heart rate (approximately 15%) and blood pressure (approximately 30%) that, however, were of shorter duration. Neither reduced amounts of smoke (1/6 or 1/3) nor nicotine (25-1,000 micrograms/kg, intravenously) had any major effect on the bicarbonate secretion. In the spontaneously breathing rat, smoke was administered for 1-2 breaths every 30 s during a 5-min period. This exposure resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in bicarbonate secretion and some increase in the blood pressure. Exposure to smoke had no effect on the secretion in rats with both splanchnic nerves cut, suggesting neural sympathetic mediation of the smoke-induced inhibition.\r"

Microscopic observation of the microvasculature in the injured area after exsanguination of rats and in living rats confirmed that there was congestion of the blood flow in the collecting venules and capillaries. Hemorrhage was observed about 30 min after application of ethanol. Monastral blue dye was deposited along the postcapillary venules only at the border of the congestion area. A selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA-861, inhibited the gastric lesion, and immunoreactive leukotriene C4 (LTC4) was detected in the gastric wall. Previous exposure of the gastric mucosa to 1.0 M NaCl solution inhibited the ethanol-induced mucosal injury markedly. NaCl solutions (0.5-1.0 M) also suppressed the electrical activity of smooth muscle and the suppression was released by indomethacin. Having observed that PGE2 generation in the stomach was induced dose-dependently by intragastric NaCl solutions (0.5-1.0 M), we propose the hypothesis that peptide LTs released by intragastric ethanol constrict the collecting venules or lamina muscularis mucosae and induce congestion of these venules, whereas the PGE2 released by intragastric NaCl solution releases the congestion of the collecting venules directly or through suppression of contraction of the lamina muscularis.\r"

In both experiments we recorded an ulcer index and measured mucosal generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin I2 (6-keto-PGF1a). In conclusion: (a) Cold restraint stress is associated with a time-dependent decrease in gastric mucosal PGE2 generation, but no change in 6-keto-PGF1a generation, and an increase in mucosal injury that is maximal by 2 h. (b) Adrenalectomy augments the effects of stress on mucosal injury but has no effect on prostaglandin generation; thus, the ulcerogenic effect of adrenalectomy appears to be independent of an effect on prostaglandin generation.\r"

In neutral GSLs, although GalCer was the most abundant component in every tissue examined, species-specific differences were clearly observed in their composition. Acidic GSLs were composed of sulfatides and gangliosides. Every gastric mucosa contained sulfatides (GalCer-sulfate) in a high concentration. The concentrations of sulfatides per gram of dry weight were 416.0, 933.8, 394.0, 365.9, and 135.9 nmol for the human fundus, human antrum, rabbit fundus, rabbit antrum, and rat glandular stomach, respectively. On the other hand, gangliosides were less in these tissues. The molar ratios of sulfatides to GM3, a major ganglioside, were 4.3, 6.7, 11.1, 2.1, and 1.2 for each gastric mucosa described above, respectively. A high sulfatide concentration in animal gastric mucosa, with its structural similarity to sucralfate, implies that sulfatides may play an important role for gastrointestinal mucosal protection.\r"

These results suggest that oxygen-free radical and lipid peroxidation contribute to the formation of gastric mucosal lesions, and that the sources of oxygen radicals seem to be different among these experimental models.\r"

Male Wistar rats weighing about 200 g were divided into two groups and given single intraperitoneal injections of indomethacin 5 mg/kg, either suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt or vehicle alone, after an overnight fast. After 6 h, all rats were injected by tail vein with tritiated thymidine, 1 microCi/g body weight, to label proliferating cells and were killed 1 h later. Sections from fundic and antral mucosae were processed for light autoradiography. Parenteral indomethacin resulted in spotty erosions in fundic mucosa. Histologically, there was congestion with or without epithelial disruption. These areas were excluded in the proliferation measurements. There was a significant decrease not only in the number of labeled cells but also in the thickness of the proliferative zone with the thinning of the entire mucosal thickness in the fundic mucosa. None of the measurements in antral mucosa showed significant difference. These results showed that a single parenteral injection of indomethacin inhibits epithelial proliferation and decreases mucosal thickness in fundic, but not antral mucosa of the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between lesion formation, gastric motility, and vascular permeability was examined in rats using indomethacin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG). Both indomethacin (25 mg/kg s.c.) and 2DG (100 mg/kg/h i.v.) produced gastric hypermotility and induced lesions, mostly confined to the rugal crests of the mucosal folds; the onset of hypermotility preceded appearance of the lesions in both cases. The mucosal microvascular permeability as determined by the amount of extravasated dye (Evans blue) was increased in response to these two agents, and the permeability responses also preceded appearance of the lesions. Both the increased vascular permeability and the severity of lesions were significantly reduced when the hypermotility was inhibited by pretreatment with atropine (3 mg/kg s.c.). The severity of the lesions were also markedly reduced or worsened, respectively, by hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg s.c.) or N-ethylmaleimide (10 mg/kg s.c.) at the doses that significantly decreased or enhanced the vascular permeability responses caused by indomethacin and 2DG. These results suggest that the enhanced gastric motility as induced by indomethacin and 2DG may cause microcirculatory disturbances in the specific sites of the mucosa (mucosal folds), probably by abnormal compression of the gastric wall, leading to the increased microvascular permeability and cellular damage.\r"

All three polyclonal antihuman FN antibodies used in this study reacted immunohistologically exclusively with the chief cells. Monoclonal antibody against C-terminal peptide or cell binding peptide reacted clearly with the human chief cells, but monoclonal antibodies against FN N-terminal and midmolecule failed to react with the cells. Western blot analysis of the rat gastric mucosal extract with polyclonal antihuman FN antibody showed that this substance has a molecular weight of about 70,000 Da. Therefore, this substance appears to be a fragment containing the C-terminal peptide of whole molecule FN and thus in the present study is named FN-related substance (FNRS). In a further study with ethanol-induced ulcer model of the rat, the physiological significance of FNRS was examined. The FNRS decreased remarkably, in a dose-dependent manner, in the fundic mucosa of the rats that ingested ethanol. The FNRS appeared to be associated with development of mucosal damage and repair, subsequently playing, in part, an important role in the gastric mucosal protection mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the roles of endogenous leukotrienes and prostaglandins in the ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, the effect of AA-861 (a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) and indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) on the ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions was investigated in fasted rats. Furthermore, the effect of these agents on the gastric mucosal microcirculatory disturbance induced by ethanol was also investigated using laser Doppler velocimetry and reflectance spectrophotometry. Forty percent ethanol caused mucosal microcirculatory stasis and mucosal hypoxemia, followed by mucosal injury. The pretreatment with AA-861 reduced the mucosal injury and significantly reduced the mucosal congestion and hypoxia induced by 40% ethanol. The pretreatment with indomethacin did not reduce the gastric mucosal damage or influence the mucosal blood flow stasis and the mucosal hypoxemia induced by ethanol. These results suggested that the increase of endogenous leukotrienes after intragastric administration of ethanol is responsible for the mucosal microcirculatory disturbance and mucosal tissue hypoxemia resulting in the mucosal injury, and that the decrease of prostaglandins alone may not play an important role in ethanol-induced mucosal injury.\r"

Whether C. pylori is the direct etiologic cause of either or both of these illnesses remains unclear. Possible pathophysiologic effects of C. pylori are still a matter of debate and conjecture. Utilizing a small group of patients with gastric ulcers and chronic gastritis, we examined the ultrastructural relationship between C. pylori and gastric cells. Forty-eight percent of our gastric ulcer patients and 57% of our chronic gastritis patients had C. pylori in their lower corpus mucosa. Examination with the transmission electron microscope indicated a very close proximation by C. pylori to the surface epithelial cells strongly suggesting adherence. We also describe for the first time the invasion of gastric cells by C. pylori. Although an uncommon occurrence, we had repeated observations of C. pylori invading surface epithelial cells, parietal cells, and chief cells. Most of the intracellular C. pylori were intact but other forms appearing to be degenerating organisms were also seen. We suggest that cell invasion may be one mechanism by which C. pylori causes pathologic changes in the gastric mucosa. These observations may also explain why C. pylori chronically infects gastric cells and frequently recurs after treatment.\r"

Histologic examinations of such tissues indicate a close approximation of C. pylori with gastric surface epithelial cells. A recent report has described both adherence and cell invasion of gastric cells by C. pylori. Using a transmission electron microscope, we have examined the interaction between C. pylori, C. jejuni, and E. coli in vitro with a gastric cancer cell line, Kato III. Our results indicate marked toxicity of E. coli and moderate toxicity of C. jejuni for Kato III cells. C. pylori had only a minor effect on tissue culture viability. C. pylori was found to have a strong association with the Kato III cell membranes and evidence of occasional cell invasion. Both C. jejuni and E. coli showed no attachment or association with the Kato III cells. We interpret these findings as indicating that C. pylori may have a specific adhesion for gastric cells.\r"

None of the survivors showed severe neurologic impairment, and all had returned to self-sufficient physical activity. However, the behavior rating scale scores were significantly worse in patients with postanoxic coma. The processing ability linked to memory was significantly worse in the postanoxic coma group. Mood disorders were also observed in this group, but they did not have pathological significance. The remarkably low incidence of neurologic and psychological sequelae in these resuscitated patients, particularly in those with early clinical evidence of severe cerebral damage, is an encouraging result that supports the therapeutic systems development and efforts in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\r"

Less than 20% of these children were treated in an accident and emergency (A&E) department staffed by a qualified pediatrician. Only 35% of the A&E departments were staffed by a qualified emergency physician. A Pediatric Trauma Board is proposed, which will lead to improvement in the care of injured or critically ill pediatric patients. This board is made of pre-marked whiteboard and includes normal pediatric values and replacement fluid flow charts; it is approximately three feet in height and six feet in width. The Board is aimed primarily at nonpediatric clinicians who may or may not be specifically trained or interested in emergency medicine. It provides quick, easy access to the normal values of vital signs for children of different ages and sizes. It enables accurate calculation of the fluid requirements for resuscitation and provides a means for following the response to this therapy. Drug doses per weight are provided. A copy of the board can be made on size A4 photostats for inclusion in the hospital chart as part of the admission notes.\r"

Oral loading doses of 4-MP were followed by supplemental doses every 12 h through 5 days, producing plasma levels in the therapeutic range. A slight, transient elevation in one or both serum transaminase values was observed in 6 of the 15 subjects treated with 4-MP. This effect was not dose related nor apparently mediated through a hypersensitivity reaction. Serum triglyceride levels were increased in 30% of 4-MP treated subjects, but also in 25% of the placebo subjects. 4-MP treatment did not produce any other significant changes in objective clinical parameters nor in subjective side effects. The results suggest that a mild, transient increase in liver function tests might be observed in some subjects treated with multiple doses of 4-MP. Nevertheless, the slower elimination rate and lesser degree of toxicity of 4-MP would make it preferable to ethanol in therapy of these poisonings.\r"

  ".W": "In a review of 52 articles, published between 1953 and 1989, 656 patients with blunt traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta or brachiocephalic arteries were identified. Of these, 608 (92.7%) had an abnormal mediastinum on initial chest radiographs obtained in the emergency department, thus allowing early detection of the vascular injury. Unfortunately, 48 (7.3%) of these patients had a normal mediastinum on their initial chest radiographs. This appears to occur when the traumatic pseudoaneurysm is not accompanied by associated mediastinal hemorrhage or hematoma formation, and the pseudoaneurysm is either small or is situated in such a way that it does not alter the mediastinal contour. The use of accessory clinical and radiographic signs to indicate the need for aortography has been shown to be of very low yield, but would have allowed the early detection of an additional 5.6% of the reported cases. Performing aortography solely on the basis of a history of major decelerating blunt trauma to the thorax remains the only way, in the acute emergency department setting, to detect the 1.7% of patients with aortic or brachiocephalic arterial rupture who have no mediastinal abnormality or accessory clinical or radiographic signs of vascular injury. There is evidence from the literature, however, to suggest that the evaluation of serial chest radiographs obtained at close intervals for the first month following trauma for the development of mediastinal abnormality or large hemothorax is an acceptable alternative to the routine performance of aortography in those blunt chest trauma victims with no clinical or radiographic suspicion of vascular injury.\r"

Molecular biology has a role, too, in improving understanding of the epidemiology of resistance and pathogenicity in hospital-acquired infections. Although antibiotic prescription and other medical practices influence the environment profoundly, we should remember that we may be experiencing long-term trends beyond our present understanding. As more and more reconstructive bone and joint surgery is carried out, careful observational epidemiology remains a vital tool.\r"

Such perturbations allow bone infection with much smaller inocula. Typical inocula decreases are 1000 to 10,000 fold. Staphylococci may have a selective advantage in bone because of specialized or tropic binding, perhaps to cartilage or collagen. Osteoclast-induced resorption of hydroxyapatite might explain the distribution of some osteomyelitis. Increased osteoclast activity could link the susceptible metaphyseal regions, the repetitively traumatized diabetic foot, a history of blunt bone trauma, fracture, and perhaps even nearby soft tissue infection. Diagnosis remains difficult; gallium-67 and indium111 labeled WBC probably deserve additional investigation. Therapeutic failures in the rabbit and rat models mirror clinical experience. Clindamycin, rifampin, and quinolones are promising. Neither systemic nor local antimicrobial prophylaxis is well studied yet.\r"

Because synovial fluid findings (leukocyte counts and glucose) may not be predictive of infection, bacteriologic analysis by smear and culture is necessary in the evaluation of any new synovial effusion. A chronic monarticular process is highly likely to be infectious also, but mycobacterial or fungal etiologies frequently require appropriate culture of synovial tissue in addition to processing fluid. Acute polyarticular syndromes are seen as manifestations of disseminated gonococcal infections (DGI) and certain viral infections in adults. Diagnostic clues include historic and physical findings (exposure history and type of rash). The major pathogen in adults remains Staphylococcus aureus, so initial therapy is directed at this organism unless urinary tract infection is present also. Proper recommended therapy for DGI is ceftriaxone because penicillin-resistant strains are present in many urban centers. Early recognition and treatment of bacterial arthritis may prevent poor outcome, particularly in elderly patients or those with underlying joint diseases. For chronic mycobacterial or fungal infections, surgery may need to be combined with medical management.\r"

The hematogenous pyogenic form is characteristically a disease of people over age 50, predominantly in the male population, and most frequently caused by S. aureus. In IVDAs, however, younger patients and a heavier predominance of males are seen, and P. aeruginosa is one of the most commonly seen pathogens. The disease is generally monomicrobial, unless it is secondary to a contiguous process such as a pressure sore, in which polymicrobial infection with participation of anaerobes is the general rule. Lumbar, greater than thoracic, greater than cervical involvement is the rule in the general population, but cervical spine involvement is frequently seen more often than thoracic involvement in IVDAs. Diabetic patients are over-represented among patients with vertebral osteomyelitis, and they also have a tendency for higher morbidity and mortality. Simultaneous involvement of adjacent vertebral end plates and the intervening disk is the general rule. The vertebrae are generally involved, and the posterior elements of the spine are involved infrequently. Posterior element involvement is seen more commonly in actinomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and neoplasms. Newer diagnostic modalities, such as CT, MRI, and radionuclide scans, may detect the disease earlier than conventional radiographs. Immunobilization by bed rest and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are generally sufficient in the therapy of pyogenic, as well as tuberculous, vertebral osteomyelitis. In selected circumstances, such as in the presence of marked instability of the spine, the presence of new neurologic deficits, or with progression of previous neurologic deficits, surgical intervention may be necessary. With prompt diagnosis and proper management, the prognosis should generally be good.\r"

Moreover A10 mAb binding is followed by proliferation effects on all the target cells analyzed, and the phenomenon is accessory cell and IL-2 dependent. The effects of A10 mAb synergizing both CD2 and CD3 activation pathways indicate that CD38 signal transduction mechanism(s) are apparently different from the aforementioned. Nevertheless the decreased A10-driven proliferation after CD3-Ti modulation suggests a possible functional interdependence between these activation pathways. Taken together, the results indicate that the CD38 molecule might play a physiologic role in T, NK, and plasma cell regulation.\r"

To examine the status of hapten-specific memory B cells from suppressed mice, highly enriched populations of TNP-specific memory B cells were purified from the spleen of TNP-KLH (control) or KLH/TNP-KLH (suppressed) immunized mice and tested in vitro for their ability to respond to TD or TI (TNP-KLH, TNP-LPS) antigenic challenge in presence of a KLH-specific Th cell line. Similar numbers of TNP-specific B cells with the characteristics of memory B cells were obtained from control and suppressed mice. TNP-specific B cells from suppressed mice could be triggered to IgG production by TNP-LPS but had an impaired ability to differentiate into IgG-secreting cells in response to TNP-KLH. This impaired IgG response to TNP-KLH was not due to an active suppression by a subset of TNP-specific B cells, or to an impedence of memory cells to a class switching but to an intrinsic memory B cell defect. TNP-specific B cells from suppressed mice were as efficient as memory B cells from control mice to present TNP-KLH to KLH-specific Th cells and to proliferate in response to T cell help. Our data support the view that the effector mechanism of epitope specific regulation does not interfere with the development of hapten-specific memory B cells but that these cells have an intrinsic defect that prevents their differentiation into active IgG antibody secreting cells in response to a T-dependent antigenic challenge.\r"

  ".U": "91010707\r", 
  ".W": "Thy-1- T cells expressing CD4 and the alpha beta-TCR have been identified in murine lymphoid tissues. These cells are particularly prevalent in Peyer's patches (PP), representing 17 +/- 3% of PP CD4 T cells, whereas they are much less prevalent in spleen, lymph nodes, lamina propria, or peritoneum. Phenotypic studies of fresh-isolated PP T cells demonstrate that all PP CD4 T cells (both Thy-1- and Thy-1+) express CD3, alpha beta-TCR, and CD5 (Lyt-1), whereas none coexpress CD8 (Lyt-2). Thy-1- and Thy-1+ CD4 T cell lines generated from PP also coexpress CD3 and alpha beta-TCR, but are heterogeneous in expression of CD5 and again do not coexpress CD8. Further studies revealed that Thy-1- CD4+ T cells were not present in nude mice. Short term stimulation of Thy-1+ CD4+ PP T cells with anti-CD3 resulted in loss of Thy-1 in a substantial fraction of these cells. Functional studies of Thy-1- and Thy-1+ CD4+ PP T cells indicate that fresh-isolated Thy-1- CD4+ cells do not proliferate in response to insoluble anti-CD3 but do proliferate when stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 in the presence of feeder cells. In contrast, Thy-1+ CD4+ cells proliferate well to both stimuli. However, Thy-1- CD4+ PP T cells adapted to in vitro culture exhibit vigorous proliferative responses when stimulated with either form of anti-CD3. Evaluation of lymphokine secretion by fresh-isolated Thy-1- and Thy-1+ CD4+ PP T cells revealed that both make substantial amounts of IL-2; however, Thy-1- T cells made less IL-4 than their Thy-1+ counterparts. Neither population made IL-5 or IFN-gamma. Similarly, Thy-1- and Thy-1+ CD4 T cell lines made similar amounts of IL-2; again Thy-1- T cells made less IL-4; and in this case Thy-1- T cells made IL-5 albeit significantly less than the Thy-1+ cells. Finally, immunohistochemical studies suggested that many of the CD4+ T cells in PP germinal centers were Thy-1-, indicating that Thy-1- and Thy-1+ CD4 T cells differ in their distribution within the PP. These studies thus define a phenotypically and functionally distinct T cell population which is most prevalent in murine Peyer's patches.\r"

  ".W": "Salmonella typhimurium mitogen (STM) is a polyclonal activator of rat B lymphocytes, triggering them to proliferate, but not differentiate, to antibody-secreting cells. When lymphokines in the form of a supernatant from Con A-stimulated splenocytes (CAS) are added to B cell cultures activated by STM, only a small number of cells are driven to differentiate. Only with the addition of a third signal provided by the polyanionic polysaccharide dextran sulfate (DXS) is significant rat B cell differentiation observed. In this study, we have shown that this requirement for DXS is not unique to the STM mitogen. LPS, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I-fixed cells, and anti-Ig antibody all induced rat B cell proliferation with little differentiation, even in the presence of CAS. DXS was necessary to induce differentiation in all cultures costimulated with mitogen and CAS. The requirement for DXS for optimal B cell differentiation is also observed with other lymphokine preparations such as the supernatants from PMA-stimulated EL-4 cells and PHA-stimulated human T cells. Furthermore, this augmentative effect of DXS in rat B cell differentiation was not confined to polyclonal activation systems. Ag-specific IgG secretion was also increased when DXS was added to Ag and CAS costimulated cultures of B cells harvested from the draining lymph nodes of rats immunized with DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Within the polyclonal activation system, a method of staged additions of STM, DXS, and CAS to B cell cultures was used to investigate the role of DXS during B cell differentiation. Optimal differentiation occurred only when DXS was present in the B cell cultures in conjunction with CAS. The augmentation in differentiation seen with DXS did not appear to be due to the recruitment of an additional CAS-responsive B cell subset, because cycling, low density B cell blasts showed large increases in IgM secretion with subsequent exposure to DXS and CAS. These studies suggest tha DXS acts as a cofactor to various differentiation factors, augmenting polyclonal and Ag-specific rat B cell differentiation. The relevance of DXS to in vivo immune responses is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Germinal center formation and the development of B cell memory in lymphoid tissue is a T cell-dependent process. The specific B cell-T cell interactions, and/or cytokines, resulting in germinal center cell growth have not yet been identified. Germinal center B cells were separated from other lymph node (LN) B cells by panning on peanut agglutinin (PNA)-coated dishes. Resulting fractions enriched for PNA+ (germinal center) B cells, and the PNA- (other) LN B cells from immune SJL mice were assayed for proliferation in the presence of cytokines. PNA+ and PNA- B cells responded equally to IL-4 in the anti-mu co-stimulator assay. In contrast, PNA+ B cells responded to murine (r)IL-5 or human B cell growth factor in the dextran sulfate (DxS) co-stimulator assay, to a much greater degree than did PNA- B cells. The same results were obtained with PNA+ and PNA- cells from LAF1 mice. Unfractionated LN B cells from nonimmunized SJL or BALB/c mice did not respond to IL-5 with or without DxS. B cell populations from BALB/c mice such as from spleen and peritoneal cavity, which are known to be high in Ly-1+B cells, responded to IL-5 alone, and more dramatically, to IL-5 as a co-stimulator with DxS. Such populations of cells from SJL mice, which are known to contain low numbers of Ly-1+B cells, responded markedly less. These results are consistent with those of others which show that in nonimmunized mice, Ly-1+B cells are a major IL-5 responsive subpopulation. IL-1 enhanced the proliferation of PNA+ cells in response to rIL-5 and had no effect on PNA- cells. IL-4 and IL-5 did not enhance each other's effects as co-stimulators of proliferation. In contrast to PNA+ B cells from immune LN, B cells activated by Escherichia coli endotoxin exhibited no responses to rIL-5. The present results indicate that in immune LN, PNA+, germinal center B cells constitute a prominent IL-5-responsive population.\r"

  ".W": "Preincubation for 20 h with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) markedly augmented the chemotactic responsiveness of human blood monocytes to the classical chemoattractant, FMLP. A modest enhancement of monocyte spontaneous locomotion in the absence of chemoattractants was also observed. Maximal increase of monocyte migration was observed after pretreatment with 10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3 and was detectable at FMLP concentrations ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-7) M. Pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 augmented the number of monocyte high affinity FMLP receptors (1500 +/- 220 and 3800 +/- 300 sites per cell for untreated and 1,25(OH)2D3-pretreated cells, respectively) with no significant changes in Kd values (2 +/- 0.5 nM and 4 +/- 1 nM, for untreated and 1,25(OH)2D3-pretreated monocytes). Enhanced chemotaxis was not restricted to FMLP, because 1,25(OH)2D3-treated monocytes showed enhanced migration also in response to activated C components and chemotactic cytokines. In agreement with previous observations, monocytes from AIDS patients showed defective migration capacity. In vitro exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated monocyte migration in all 10 patients examined with considerable quantitative differences among individuals. Regulating the responsiveness of mature monocytes to chemo-attractants, 1,25(OH)2D3, produced systemically or in situ by immunocompetent cells, could play a role in the regulation of the recruitment of monocytes at sites of inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, or bone resorption. The potential of 1,25(OH)2D3 as a restorative agent under conditions of defective phagocyte recruitment deserves further exploration.\r"

Treatment of F1 cell-injected BALB/c mice with 15 mg of anti-IL-4 mAb was shown to interfere with tolerance induction, as assessed by the high percentages of H-2b target cell lysis and the very low or undetectable levels of B cell chimerism markers observed in these mice. Treatment with 4.5 mg of anti-IL-4 mAb interfered with tolerance induction only in one-third of F1 cell-injected BALB/c mice, but that dose induces specific modulations of the autoimmune manifestations in all mice, leading to the nearly complete prevention of the disease. In particular, the production of anti-ssDNA IgG1 and of total IgG1 and IgE antibodies was seriously affected by the treatment, as well as the proliferation and membrane Ia and K expression of F1 donor splenic cells and thymic APC. Treatment of F1 cell-injected BALB/c mice between 24 and 48 h of life with 0.5 mg of anti-IL-4 mAb did not interfere with tolerance induction, but had similar effects on the autoimmune syndrome as treatment with 4.5 mg. These results suggest that, after F1 cell injection of newborn mice, IL-4 plays an important role in the cellular interactions leading to the induction of tolerance to the corresponding alloantigens and to the development of the associated autoimmune syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Experimentally induced and naturally occurring inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are often associated with a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and edema within the CNS itself. CD4+ T cells are now clearly implicated in the pathogenesis of the induced CNS disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and previous in vivo experiments had indicated that these cells may be capable of directly damaging the CNS vasculature. To assess the capacity of CD4+ T cells to damage brain vascular endothelial cells (EC) in vitro, two lines with specificity for myelin basic protein and OVA were prepared and added to cultures of EC. We show here that both lines, when added in a resting state, severely disrupt the EC monolayers in an Ag-specific manner. The interaction is dependent on the recognition of Ag in the context of MHC class II and is blocked in the presence of mAb specific for CD4. Addition of T cell lines preactivated on irradiated thymocyte APC caused a high level of Ag nonspecific damage to the EC, which was not blocked by the addition of anti-CD4 mAb. Supernatants derived from these latter cells did not alone damage the EC monolayers despite the presence of TNF activity suggesting that T cell-EC contact may be required for these cell lines to mediate their effector function. Both resting and preactivated lines adhered strongly to the EC in the absence of Ag. The capacity of CD4+ T cells to strongly adhere to, and disrupt the integrity of, brain vascular EC may be important in the early stages of CNS disease mediated by this cell type.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous study showed that in cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) induced by intradermal injection of autoreactive T cells the epidermal structures spontaneously recovered from the destruction became resistant to the subsequent attempts to induce the cutaneous GVHD and that the resistance correlated well with a 30-fold increase in the number of Thy-1+ epidermal cells (Thy-1+EC). We show that the resistance to the cutaneous GVHD was never induced in athymic nude mice and adult thymectomy lethal radiation and bone marrow reconstitution (ATXBM) mice under the same conditions, indicating that the induction of the resistance is dependent on the presence of thymus. A great increase in the number of Thy-1+EC was similarly observed in the epidermis of the athymic nude and ATXBM mice that spontaneously recovered from the cutaneous GVHD and that remained susceptible to the induction of the cutaneous GVHD. However, the results with B10Thy-1.1----B6 radiation chimeras clearly demonstrate that the vast majority of the increased Thy-1+EC found in the \"susceptible\" epidermis of the ATXBM mice were of donor bone marrow origin and there was no increase in the number of host-derived Thy-1+EC, whereas in the \"resistant\" epidermis of the XBM mice both Thy-1+EC populations were equally increased. The overall results indicate that the expansion of Thy-1+EC that mature in the thymus is crucial to the induction of the resistance, although the migration of bone marrow-derived Thy-1+EC precursors to the epidermis occurs quite independently of the presence of thymus.\r"

  ".W": "A spleen cell population that lacks CD3, CD4, CD8, Thy-1, B220, and class II major histocompatibility complex cell-surface markers (non-B, non-T cells) produces IL-4 when cultured in wells coated with IgE. Their production of IL-4 in response to plate-bound (PB)-IgE is strikingly enhanced by IL-3, and in the presence of IL-3, these cells also produce IL-4 in response to PB-IgG2a. The effect of IL-3 is not mimicked by IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) or IFN-gamma. Non-B, non-T cells cultured with IL-3 for 12 h acquire the capacity to produce enhanced amounts of IL-4 in response to subsequent culture with PB-Ig even if IL-3 is omitted from the second culture. Irradiated cells also respond to IL-3 with enhanced capacity to produce IL-4 to PB-Ig, indicating that cell proliferation is not required for the effect of IL-3. The IL-3 effect can be obtained in vivo; treatment of mice with a total dose 90,000 U of synthetic IL-3 over a 3-day period results in the presence of splenic and peritoneal cavity non-B, non-T cells that produce enhanced amounts of IL-4 in response to PB-Ig. The FcR that mediates the response to PB-IgE appears to be Fc epsilon RI because cells can be sensitized with IgE anti-DNP mAb, washed, cultured for 15 h at 37 degrees C, washed again, and stimulated to produce IL-4 with 0.1 to 1 ng/ml of TNP10-OVA. IL-3 does not appear to mediate its function by increasing the number of Fc epsilon RI because it can exert its effect when cultured with non-B, non-T cells after they have been sensitized with IgE anti-DNP. However, IL-3 pretreatment does affect the signaling process in that non-B, non-T cells sensitized with IgE anti-DNP show strikingly reduced production of IL-4 to concentrations of TNP10-OVA of 100 ng/ml or more whereas cells pretreated with IL-3 show little or no diminution in IL-4 production at concentrations of TNP10-OVA up to 1 microgram/ml.\r"

CRP mRNA accumulation in the hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 cell line was slightly more rapid, but of smaller magnitude in response to IL-1 beta (fourfold increase) than to IL-6 (10-fold increase); however, the amount of CRP protein accumulating in the culture medium was similar for both cytokines. TGF-beta at concentrations greater than or equal to 0.1 pg/ml inhibited the induced IL-1 or IL-6 CRP production; whereas concentrations less than 0.1 pg/ml slightly enhanced CRP synthesis. Addition of TGF-beta to the cultures up to 16 h after the PLC/PRF/5 cells were already exposed to IL-1 or IL-6 resulted in the cessation of CRP production. CRP mRNA accumulated in hepatoma cells treated with both TGF-beta and IL-6, although CRP protein synthesis was inhibited. A similar pattern of inhibition of CRP production by TGF-beta occurred when Hep 3B.2 cells were treated with a mixture of IL-1 and IL-6. Enhanced production of CRP was observed only when TGF-beta was added to the cells before the cytokine. This enhanced CRP response was sensitive to cycloheximide. TGF-beta added along with IL-6 inhibited the metabolic labeling of CRP with [35S]methionine; however, enhanced incorporation of [35S]methionine into CRP was observed when the cells were exposed to TGF-beta before IL-6 addition. Therefore, TGF-beta is potentially a potent regulator of CRP synthesis by hepatocytes at the post-transcriptional level.\r"

In 20 of 22 synovial fluids and 12 of 13 synovial tissue culture supernatants, no IL-1 bioactivity could be detected in the thymocyte proliferation assay. These same preparations could, however, support proliferation of fibroblast monolayers, consistent with the presence of IL-1 and/or other fibroblast growth factors. Addition of either rheumatoid synovial fluids or synovial culture supernatants to exogenous IL-1 in the IL-1 bioassay caused marked inhibition of the assay indicative of an IL-1 inhibitor. This inhibition of IL-1 could be reversed by treating the effusions or supernatants with a neutralizing antibody to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Furthermore, monocyte-macrophages isolated from rheumatoid synovial fluid constitutively released both latent and active TGF-beta in culture at levels sufficient to completely block the biologic activity of 100 U/ml IL-1. The production of substantial levels of TGF-beta by synovial macrophages, as well as the apparent ability of these inflammatory macrophages to activate latent TGF-beta, implicates TGF-beta not only as an important inhibitor of IL-1-induced lymphocyte proliferation, but also as a key cytokine in promoting synovial fibroblast hyperplasia and pathology.\r"

To determine whether C1q participates in fibroblast adhesion, cells in serum-free medium were plated on surfaces coated with purified C1q at physiologic ionic strength and pH. Surfaces coated with fibronectin or collagen type I served as positive controls, and those coated with BSA were negative controls. Substratum-adsorbed C1q promoted fibroblast adhesion to a maximum of 73% of available cells within 90 min at 37 degrees C. Adhesion was C1q concentration dependent, saturable, specific, and dependent on the collagen-like domain of the molecule. De novo protein synthesis plays a role in adhesion: pretreatment of fibroblasts with cycloheximide reduced adherence about 50% of controls. Addition of exogenous fibronectin, collagen type I, or C1q as soluble mediators did not affect adhesion of the cycloheximide-treated cells to C1q substrate. Adhesion could be accounted for primarily, although not completely, by the C1q receptors. Antibodies raised against the Raji cell C1q receptors (alpha C1qR Ab) specifically inhibited fibroblast adhesion to C1q substrates about 60% of controls. The binding of fibroblasts to C1q substrates could be inhibited about 24% of controls with the GRGDTP cell recognition peptide. GRGDTP and alpha C1q Ab had an additive effect on adhesion that was inhibited 77 to 80% of controls. We conclude from these data that aggregated rather than monomeric C1q may be the natural ligand of the fibroblast C1q receptor, and the biologic function of the receptor in cells of the connective tissue may be cell adhesion.\r"

Two approaches were used to demonstrate the self-association of autobodies: size-exclusion column chromatography and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated precipitation assay. The anti-phosphorylcholine antibody T15 and two somatic variants, U4, which binds DNA, and U10, which has no identified specificity, produced larger precipitates in 10% PEG than other non-self-binding antibodies. The selectivity of PEG-mediated precipitation of self-binding antibodies is demonstrated by reduction of precipitation with specific haptens known to inhibit self-binding in solid-phase assays. Phosphorylcholine and nucleotides reduced precipitation of T15 and U4, respectively, but not U10. To rule out Fc-Fc mediated self-association in solution, we have also demonstrated self-complexing of F(ab')2 fragments of T15 using PEG. The self-binding locus was further dissected using peptides derived from V regions. A 24-residue peptide derived from the second hypervariable region of the VH of S107 specifically enhanced precipitation of T15, U4, and U10, but not other antibodies. These results provide evidence of a dormant potential of self-binding antibodies to precipitate under conditions that reduce the solubility of proteins. The implication of this potential is discussed with respect to pathological complex formation.\r"

Two antibodies (J7F2 and H2B6) were selected for study on the basis of their ability to react with bacterial envelope proteins (ELISA) and B27-positive cells (immunofluorescence). J7F2 reacted preferentially with B27-positive cells and neither antibody reacted with MHC class I negative cells. Based on SDS-PAGE blot analysis of bacterial envelope proteins, the pattern of reactivity for both antibodies (against 36- and 19-kDa proteins) was the same as that for a third monoclonal produced against bacterial envelope and reactive with B27-positive cells. This apparent epitope similarity was investigated by using synthetic peptides to inhibit binding of the monoclonals. The B27 synthetic peptide and a smaller peptide derived from it were efficient inhibitors of antipeptide and antibacterial antibody binding to bacterial Ag and B27-positive cells. These studies provide insight into the molecular basis of cross-reactivity between bacterial proteins and MHC class I molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple molecular species of platelet activating factor (PAF) are produced as a result of inflammatory processes. PAF-induced neutrophil migration across endothelium is intrinsic to inflammatory responses. We therefore compared the ability of three naturally occurring PAF species (C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1), which only varied at carbon 1, to induce 51Cr-labeled human neutrophil migration across a naked 3-microns pore filter and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) monolayers cultured on these filters. Time-course experiments indicated that all species of PAF tested induced significant neutrophil migration between 15 and 45 min. PAF-induced neutrophil migration through both filters alone and HUVE monolayers occurred at lower doses with C16:0 PAF. The rank order of chemotactic potency for the PAF species was C16:0 greater than C18:0 greater than C18:1 with both filters and endothelium coated filters as barriers. Intrinsic differences in the potency of these PAF molecular species to induce neutrophil chemotaxis were greater when HUVE cells were the barriers vs when filters alone were the barriers. Regardless of the molecular species used, at optimal PAF doses the degree of neutrophil migration through HUVE cells was often greater than that through filters alone. The specific PAF antagonist WEB 2086 inhibited neutrophil migration induced by all three PAF species equally. WEB 2086 pretreatment of the neutrophil or WEB 2086 coincubation with PAF, but not WEB 2086 pretreatment of the HUVE cell monolayers, significantly inhibited (65 to 80%) neutrophil migration. We conclude that the degree of PAF-induced neutrophil migration is dependent upon the molecular species of PAF. Moreover, the barrier through which the neutrophil must migrate appears to be important in influencing the overall chemotactic response to the various PAF species.\r"

  ".W": "Retroviral infection is associated with immunosuppression, which has been shown to be due, in part, to the action of the envelope protein p15E. We studied a synthetic peptide (CKS-17) homologous to a highly conserved domain of the retroviral envelope protein p15E, which, when conjugated to BSA (CKS-17-BSA), can inhibit IL-1- and phorbol ester-mediated responses in cultured murine thymoma cells, and Ca2(+)- and phosphatidylserine-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) activity of cell homogenates. We characterized the mechanism of inhibition of PKC by the peptide. Using PKC purified from rat brain we found that CKS-17-BSA inhibited PKC-catalyzed Ca2(+)- and phosphatidylserine-dependent histone phosphorylation with an estimated ID50 of 4 microM. CKS-17-BSA did not inhibit the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. CKS-17-BSA also inhibited the Ca2(+)- and PS-independent activity of a catalytic fragment of PKC that was generated by limited trypsin treatment. However, CKS-17-BSA did not act as a competitive inhibitor of PKC with respect to ATP or phosphoacceptor substrate, despite the similarity between the CKS-17 sequence and substrates and pseudosubstrates of PKC. We conclude that this peptide homologue of a retroviral envelope protein has a novel mechanism of inhibition of PKC.\r"

  ".U": "91010732\r", 
  ".W": "It has been proposed that phorbol esters and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 are effective comitogens for some species of lymphocytes because together they mimic the normal secondary signals for cell activation by mitogens that cause phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) breakdown (e.g., anti-TCR and anti-Thy-1 antibodies and Con A). To test whether activation of protein kinase C and an increase in [Ca2+]i account for the activation of the mitogenic pathway in murine thymocytes by the mitogens that cause PtdInsP2 breakdown, the two-dimensional phosphorylation patterns generated by the three classes of mitogens (protein kinase C activator, Ca2+ ionophore, and activator of PtdInsP2 breakdown) and by activators of cAMP-dependent kinases have been compared. From the phosphorylation patterns, by which each mitogen could be distinguished reproducibly, it was concluded that: 1) The phosphorylation patterns generated by the mitogens that activate PtdInsP2 breakdown are only slightly affected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ under conditions that abolish the normal rise in [Ca2+]i and do not therefore depend on the activation of Ca2(+)-dependent protein kinases. In contrast, the phosphorylation pattern generated by A23187 is totally dependent on extracellular Ca2+. 2) Neither A23187 nor the mitogens that activate PtdInsP2 breakdown nor activators of cAMP-dependent kinases caused significant activation of protein kinase C assayed by phosphorylation of the diagnostic proteins 80b and 78a. Consistent with this conclusion, only the phorbol esters or oleoyl acyl glycerol caused translocation of protein kinase C activity from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction. 3) Neither A23187 nor the mitogens that cause PtdInsP2 breakdown activated cAMP-dependent kinases. Taken together the data imply that the mitogens that cause PtdInsP2 breakdown must generate an additional, independent primary mitogenic signal. It is suggested that this signal may be the activation of tyrosine kinases (e.g., p56lck) via the TCR and working hypotheses for effective combinations of primary mitogenic signals that will activate DNA synthesis are developed.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of three different peptides, substance P (SP), FMLP and melittin, to activate eosinophils purified from the peritoneal cavity of human serum-treated guinea pigs was investigated. Degranulation (eosinophil peroxidase, EPO), oxidative burst (O2-), [Ca2+]i mobilization, and arachidonic acid metabolism (thromboxane B2, TXB2) were used as indices of eosinophil activation. SP (100 nM to 100 microM), FMLP (1 to 100 microM) and melittin (10 nM to 100 microM) induced EPO release but only FMLP (1 to 100 microM) led to an elevation of [Ca2+]i. The melittin- and SP-induced EPO secretion occurred at both cytotoxic and noncytotoxic concentrations as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release. In addition, the effect of SP was not inhibited by the SP analogue (D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10)SP(4-11) and SP failed to promote the generation and subsequent release of TXA2. In contrast, FMLP (10 to 100 microM) stimulated the release of TXB2 from guinea pig eosinophils that was selectively inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with BOC-FMLP. On an equimolar basis (1 microM), melittin was approximately fivefold more active at promoting TXB2 release than FMLP. The results indicate that eosinophils respond to the three peptides, SP, melittin, and FMLP in differential fashion. We conclude that activation of guinea pig eosinophils by FMLP is likely to be receptor-mediated whereas the actions of SP and melittin may act through nonspecific peptide-membrane phospholipid interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to endothelium is an important event in the sequence of leukocyte responses to inflammatory disease. Double-color flow microfluorimetry analysis was used to determine neutrophil and monocyte adherence to suspended endothelial cells under stirred conditions. The static adherence to endothelial cell monolayers was simultaneously determined. In both assays, neutrophils behaved in a similar way. Basal adherence of neutrophils was very low. Activation by PMA or by the chemoattractants platelet-activating factor and FMLP induced rapid binding, primarily mediated by CR3. Nonactivated neutrophils showed CD18-dependent (lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 and CR3) and CD18-independent adherence to endothelial cells when the endothelial cells were prestimulated with rIL-1 beta. In contrast to neutrophils, nonactivated monocytes adhered avidly to resting endothelial cells. This adherence was partly CD18 dependent and partly CD18 independent. Whereas monocyte adherence under stirred conditions strongly increased upon activation by PMA, a significant decrease in adherence was found under static conditions, which was prevented by cytochalasin B. This decrease was limited to a distinct CD18-independent binding mechanism, and absent under stirred conditions. We conclude that monocytes adhere with (at least) three binding mechanisms to endothelial cells, a CD18-dependent and two CD18-independent mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a highly potent phospholipid mediator known to be active in many biologic systems. To date, little is known of the effect of PAF on B lymphocytes. Using two Ig-secreting B lymphoblastoid cell lines, we have demonstrated that PAF can enhance Ig production by these cells in a dose-dependent fashion. PAF also causes significant alteration of the kinetics of Ig secretion in these lymphoblastoid cell lines. The effect of PAF is rapid, with detection of 6- to 12-fold increases in Ig production in the first 24 h of cell culture, followed by a plateau during the next 24 to 48 h. The specificity of the PAF effect on Ig secretion is emphasized by lyso-PAF having no Ig-enhancing properties and by the inhibition of Ig enhancement in the presence of the structural analogue PAF antagonist CV3988 and the soluble nonstructural analogue PAF receptor antagonist Web 2086. PAF does not cause an increase in the kinetics of cell proliferation or an increase in cell numbers at any time during a 72-h culture period. In an attempt to explain the increase in Ig secretion in the absence of changes in growth parameters, an ELISA spot assay for enumeration of Ig-secreting cells was developed. This assay demonstrated that the increase in Ig production is likely due to enhancement of single cell Ig secretion rather than an increase in cell number. These data indicate that PAF may have an important immunomodulatory role in the production of Ig by B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "91010737\r", 
  ".W": "The characteristics of homotypic neutrophil aggregation, mediated by the adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18, differ according to whether activation takes place via intracellular protein kinase C(PKC) inducers or chemoattractants. In response to diacylglycerol (DAG) analogues such as PMA and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, a prolonged cellular aggregation occurs that is associated with intense phosphorylation of the CD18 beta-chain. In response to the chemoattractant FMLP, a more transient aggregation event results that is associated with minimal beta-chain phosphorylation. By using the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, we now show that these differences are likely to reflect two different pathways of activation. Both aggregation and phosphorylation induced by DAG analogues are completely abolished by staurosporine in a parallel dose-dependent manner. Conversely, FMLP-induced aggregation is enhanced and prolonged by staurosporine whereas the associated minimal phosphorylation event is further diminished by staurosporine. Accordingly, activation of neutrophil aggregation by DAG analogues is associated with and presumably due to phosphorylation of the CD18 beta-chain. This intense phosphorylation occurs via a staurosporine-sensitive kinase such as PKC. FMLP, on the other hand, appears to activate CD11b/CD18 by a distinct mechanism. This latter mechanism does not seem to be dependent on what may be a minor PKC-induced phosphorylation of the beta-chain, and indeed is enhanced by inhibition of PKC. Of note, staurosporine was also found to cause selective release of specific granules with concomitant increase in surface display of CD11b/CD18. These data further support previous observations that up-regulation of this adhesive molecule is not the primary event in the induction of cellular adhesiveness.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of PGE2 to inhibit human T cell responses was examined by investigating its effect on mitogen-induced IL-2 production and proliferation of highly purified CD4+ T cells. PGE2 inhibited both PHA and anti-CD3 induced proliferation and IL-2 production by an action directly on the responding T cell. Inhibition of IL-2 production reflected decreased accumulation of mRNA for IL-2. A variety of other cAMP elevating agents exerted similar inhibitory effects. Inhibition of proliferation could be overcome by supplemental IL-2, PMA, or the anti-CD28 mAb 9.3. Although PMA and 9.3 markedly increased the amount of IL-2 produced by mitogen-stimulated T cells, the percentage inhibition of IL-2 secretion caused by PGE2 and other cAMP elevating agents remained comparable in these costimulated cultures. Rescue of T cell DNA synthesis by these agents appeared to reflect the finding that, although PGE2 markedly inhibited IL-2 production, the absolute amount of IL-2 produced was increased sufficiently to sustain mitogen-induced proliferation. As anticipated, PGE2, forskolin, and cholera toxin increased T cell cAMP levels. The quantity of cellular cAMP generated in response to PGE2, cholera toxin, and forskolin could be inhibited by PMA or 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine. Using these reagents, the inhibitory effects of PGE2 were found to reflect intracellular cAMP levels, but only within a very narrow range. The results indicate that by elevating cAMP levels, PGE2 inhibits human T cell IL-2 production at a point that is common to both the CD3 and CD28 signaling pathways.\r"

Based on this association and flow cytometric evidence presented in this report for MBP binding to neutrophils, we examined the ability of MBP to activate human neutrophils. Incubation of neutrophils with 0.5 to 3.0 microM MBP at room temperature produced a concentration-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) response that peaked after 50 to 70 min. Reduced-and-alkylated MBP, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin did not induce CL. MBP-induced CL was abrogated in the absence of Ca2+ and was absent in neutrophils isolated from two individuals with chronic granulomatous disease. MBP also stimulated release of superoxide anion (O2-) and lysozyme but not beta-glucuronidase or lactate dehydrogenase. Additionally, 1.5 microM MBP in combination with FMLP or platelet-activating factor stimulated a synergistic increase in O2- release from cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils. The degree of synergism with FMLP or platelet-activating factor was inversely related (p less than 0.005) to the level of MBP-induced O2- release. These results indicate that MBP activates neutrophils in a noncytolytic fashion and provide evidence that eosinophil-neutrophil collaboration may contribute to the pathogenesis observed in allergic late phase reactions.\r"

  ".W": "The role of neutrophil chemoattractant receptors in neutrophil stimulation in vitro is well established, however, the precise mechanisms underlying local neutrophil accumulation at inflammatory sites in vivo have not been defined. A fundamental question that remains open is whether chemoattractants act on the endothelial cell or the neutrophil to initiate the process of neutrophil migration in vivo. To address this question we have investigated whether neutrophil accumulation in vivo can occur if chemoattractant receptor occupancy is uncoupled from neutrophil stimulation. For this purpose we have used pertussis toxin (PT) as the pharmacologic tool. We have investigated the effect of in vitro pretreatment of rabbit neutrophils with PT on their responses in vitro and on their accumulation in vivo. Pretreatment of rabbit neutrophils with PT inhibited FMLP- and C5a-, but not PMA- induced increases in CD18 expression, neutrophil adherence, and degranulation in vitro. This pretreatment procedure with PT inhibited the accumulation of radiolabeled neutrophils in vivo in response to intradermally injected FMLP, C5a, C5a des Arg, leukotriene B4, IL-8, and zymosan in rabbit skin. Further, in contrast to the in vitro results, PT inhibited the PMA-induced 111In-neutrophil accumulation in vivo. Interestingly, pretreatment of neutrophils with PT also inhibited accumulation in response to intradermally injected IL-1, despite the reports that IL-1 lacks neutrophil chemoattractant activity in vitro. Although the experimental techniques used cannot distinguish the different stages of neutrophil migration involved, these results suggest that the accumulation of neutrophils induced by local extravascular chemoattractants in vivo depends on a pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor operated event on the neutrophil itself. Further, PMA and IL-1 may release secondary chemoattractants in vivo.\r"
