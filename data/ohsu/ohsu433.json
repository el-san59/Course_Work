The authors describe a one-year-old boy initially diagnosed as having broncho-pulmonary dysplasia who developed severe failure to thrive, recurrent pneumonias, and pulmonary hypertension. The presence of an occult right pulmonary artery was suspected by lung perfusion scan and diagnosed by cardiac catheterization and angiography. After surgical repair, his clinical course improved and his growth and development were normal. This case demonstrates the importance of including occult pulmonary artery in the differential diagnosis of infants with failure to thrive associated with recurrent pulmonary infection.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of secondary infection to severity and tendency to relapse in atopic dermatitis during childhood has been assessed. A total of 57 children aged between 4 months and 14 years were followed for an average of 4.73 months. A secondary infection was diagnosed in 22 (31.4%) of 70 relapses, since the lesions only subsided with antibiotics active on the bacteria isolated from the skin, usually a coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The eczema was more severe at presentation and hypogammaglobulinemia G more often found in those children who were more susceptible to secondary infections. The hypogammaglobulinemia G was present in 13 out of the 57 patients, but it normalized with age and was not correlated with IgE levels. In the children in whom the relapse or the worsening of the eczema could be attributed to secondary infection because of the positive response to the antibiotic treatment, the lesions had the appearance of pustules or showed more exudation, although in some cases only the worsening of the erythema and itching was observed. A secondary bacterial infection should be considered a likely cause of relapse or worsening of atopic dermatitis. Furthermore it may be that, at least in first year of life, hypogammaglobulinemia G is part of an immunologic impairment of atopic dermatitis which favors the susceptibility to secondary infections.\r"

Extracts of Chironomidae (T. akamusi and C. Yoshimatsui) caused the release of histamine in six out of 13 allergic patients with positive skin tests. In contrast, histamine release induced by these allergens was not observed in leukocytes from two asthmatic patients and five control subjects without IgE antibody as evidenced by negative skin tests and RAST. There was a significant correlation between maximal histamine release and IgE antibody levels. Furthermore, a significant inverse relationship between the concentration of allergen causing 25% histamine release (HR25) and IgE antibody levels was observed. The correlation coefficients, however, between histamine release and RAST were not high, and there were discrepancies between the two tests in some cases. These results suggest that Chironomidae induce histamine release from leukocytes via IgE-mediated mechanism but histamine release cannot be replaced by RAST and also suggest that chironomid midge is one of the important allergens in Japan.\r"

Two studies were performed. First, using a double-blind crossover design, we administered to five patients 75 mg prednisone daily or placebo for two days preceding the challenge. No consistent protection against adverse reactions was achieved. In the second study, a 10-day pretreatment with 15 mg oral prednisolone and topical intrabronchial and intranasal beclomethasone offered total clinical protection against bronchospasm produced by threshold doses of aspirin in five of eight patients. In two others, the bronchospasm provoked was less severe, and only in one patient did its intensity remained unchanged. There was a significant reduction in fall of mean pulmonary function tests following the second aspirin challenge, which was performed after ten days of steroid treatment. Steroids given for ten days also prevented significantly nasal discharge and nasal blockade. When diagnostic challenge tests with aspirin are carried out in asthmatic patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy, there is an increased possibility of false negative results.\r"

To evaluate its accuracy, we compared the results from tests with the Alco dipstick with values from simultaneously measured blood alcohol tests in 53 patients who were suspected of having ingested alcohol. The correlation between Alco dipstick results and blood alcohol values was strong (r [Spearman's rho], + .91). When the blood alcohol concentration was 0.1 g/dL or more, the Alco dipstick test was 90.9% sensitive, 71.4% specific, and 92% efficient. At Alco dipstick values of 0.02 and 0.05 g/dL, however, semiquantitative concordance was unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, even at the 0.05-g/dL value of salivary alcohol, the test was still valuable as a screen of de facto alcohol ingestion. Definitive diagnosis of relative alcohol intoxication requires confirmatory breath or blood alcohol concentrations by standard methodologies.\r"

Therefore, we conducted a study to compare the efficacy of initial therapy with ipecac with therapy with activated charcoal-cathartic in a simulated acetaminophen overdosage. Ten healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, crossover trial. Subjects ingested 3.0 g acetaminophen, followed by either no intervention, 30 mL syrup of ipecac, or 50 g activated charcoal-sorbitol solution at one hour. Serial acetaminophen levels were determined at intervals over eight hours. Both interventions significantly reduced the area under the curve compared with control (P less than .05). When comparing ipecac with activated charcoal-cathartic, no significant difference was noted among these groups.\r"

Our study approximated the prehospital setting by comparing the use of tape, SBT, and Philadelphia collar (PC) with tape, the Kendrick Extrication Device (KED), and PC after immobilization in and extrication from a compact car. Seven men were immobilized with KED and SBT in addition to PCs and tape. These subjects were extricated and then taken by ambulance stretcher across a 50-yd length of concrete to the radiology suite. Flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation were measured. KED-PC (16 degrees +/- 8 degrees) was statistically superior to SBT-PC (41 degrees +/- 5 degrees) in limiting rotation (P less than .001). KED-PC and SBT-PC were similar in their abilities to limit extension (8 degrees +/- 4 degrees vs 6 degrees +/- 5 degrees), flexion (4 degrees +/- 2 degrees vs 4 degrees +/- 4 degrees), and lateral bending (13 degrees +/- 5 degrees vs 17 degrees +/- 6 degrees). In an approximation of the prehospital setting, tape, a PC, and either KED or SBT substantially limit extension, flexion, and lateral bending of the normal cervical spine. KED-PC is more beneficial in rotation.\r"

  ".W": "The pharyngeal tracheal lumen (PTL) airway is a new airway control device for emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics and functions as either an esophageal obturator or an endotracheal tube. We developed a ten-step PTL airway training protocol that included proper airway insertion, patient ventilation, and confirmation of tube placement by auscultation. We then prospectively evaluated the effectiveness of training by testing the ability of 32 EMTs and paramedics to discriminate between esophageal and endotracheal mode placement. Training consisted of a group demonstration followed by supervised individual practice on a Laerdal Adult Intubation Model. All 70 insertion attempts resulted in esophageal obturator mode placement. As a result, trainees did not have an opportunity to practice discrimination between esophageal and endotracheal placement. Six weeks after initial training, 19 of the entry group were randomly and blindly assigned to ventilate each of two Laerdal models that had been previously intubated with the PTL, one in esophageal mode and the other in endotracheal mode. In the esophageal mode, 15 of 19 trainees (79%) correctly selected the esophageal port to ventilate, but four (21%) could not decide and abandoned the airway. In the tracheal mode, 16 of 19 trainees (84%) correctly selected the tracheal port to ventilate, one (5%) was unable to decide, and two (10.5%) selected the wrong tube and attempted ventilation with the esophageal port even though the tracheal balloon was completely occluding the airway. Ventilation was confirmed with auscultation in only 50% of the attempts (19 of 38). Our study indicates that the training protocol was inadequate to teach critical decision-making in the use of the PTL airway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Survival was related to the performance of CPR before the arrival of the unit and to the finding of ventricular fibrillation.

Falls accounted for 75% of all climbing-related injuries; median length of fall was 91 m for fatal injuries and 9 m for nonfatal injuries. The majority of injuries (69%) occurred while ascending. Falls on snow or ice were longer than falls on rock, and injuries on snow or ice were more likely to be fatal. We discuss considerations and strategies for the prevention of climbing-related injuries. A new conceptual model suggests that the methods of traditional mountaineering safety programs may be of limited efficacy in further reducing the number of climbing-related injuries.\r"

A toggle switch penetrated the anterior and posterior tables of his frontal sinus and lodged in the frontal lobe. The foreign body was not found on physical examination at an emergency care facility. The wound was closed, and the patient was sent home. Severe headaches prompted his return the next day. Skull roentgenograms showed the toggle switch, and the patient was referred to our institution for definitive care. This unusual case serves to emphasize the potential for a foreign body to penetrate the frontal sinus with few physical findings.\r"

We report an ACLS provider course that was taught to sophomore medical students using a self-directed, problem-based learning model. The traditional two-day provider course format was replaced by a series of clinical problems that emphasized various aspects of the ACLS curriculum. Students then met weekly with an ACLS instructor who served as a tutor to discuss the problem. A specific set of learning objectives for the entire ACLS curriculum was developed into a study unit index and given to students at the beginning of the course. Enhanced practice time was offered to students in the form of traditional teaching stations and skills laboratories. Students were tested using standard ACLS criteria. The students in the problem-based course achieved a higher pass rate on the written test and skills stations than senior medical students did in a standard two-day course during the same time period. The problem-based format with enhanced practice time would appear to be an effective alternative for groups that need to acquire the basic skills needed in a resuscitation attempt but have little previous experience in this area.\r"

As yet, there is no clear explanation of why some patients at risk for ARDS develop the syndrome, whereas others do not. Neutrophils and complement fragments have been implicated in the acute lung injury, but it is clear from published data that evidence of complement activation alone predicts neither the development nor the severity of ARDS. We investigated whether the combination of endotoxin, a leukocyte-priming agent, and complement fragments, leukocyte-stimulating agents, was associated with the development of ARDS. Ninety-eight patients were identified as being either at risk for the development of ARDS or having ARDS, and serial blood samples were obtained. There was no correlation between C5 fragments and the development of ARDS. C3 fragment levels were increased in 89% of the patients with ARDS, but they were also increased in 62% of patients at risk. Endotoxin was detected in 74% of the plasma samples obtained from patients at risk who subsequent developed ARDS and in 64% of the plasma samples obtained from the patients with ARDS. In contrast, only 22% of the plasma samples obtained from the patients at risk who did not develop ARDS had measurable endotoxin. We suggest that the combination of endotoxin and complement fragments may be one mechanism involved in the development of ARDS.\r"

Two different approaches were used. The first, plotting the incidence of pneumonia versus the duration of ventilatory support, confirms previous data: the incidence rises from 5% in patients receiving one day of respiratory assistance to 68.8% in patients receiving more than 30 days. In the second approach, the same data were computed as an actuarial life table with the day of pneumonia onset as terminal event. This different approach, focusing on the onset of infection rather than on incidence, allows a new insight into the problem of nosocomial infection: pneumonia in patients with respiratory support is an early occurrence with a high and constant rate of acquisition and, therefore, a high risk of infection in the first eight to ten days. Later pneumonia acquisitions were rare, and the risk after ten days of ventilatory support is low.\r"

In 92% of patients with bacterial pneumonia (32 of 34), simple endotracheal aspiration samples recovered one or more microorganisms. Both BAL and TPC samples cultured colony-forming units (cfu) greater than or equal to 10(3)/ml of one or more microorganisms in 56% (19 of 34) of patients. TPC and BAL culture results agreed on 88.5% (54 of 61) of the recovered microorganisms. Sterile TPC and BAL cultures agreed on 80% (4 of 5) of the cases. Microorganisms cultured from blood samples were also cultured from BAL and TPC specimens. Culture results from the two techniques completely disagreed in only one case (3%). In the control group, one TPC and two BAL cultures yielded microorganisms in cfu greater than or equal to 10(3)/ml. Specificities of BAL and TPC were 71 and 86%, respectively, whereas specificity of endotracheal aspiration was only 14%. Both the bacterial index obtained by TPC and BAL, as well as the quantitative cultures, correlated moderately well (r = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively, p less than 0.001 for both correlations). BAL and TPC results caused changes of antibiotic treatment in 11 of 23 survivors. Neither BAL nor TPC caused complications. Our results demonstrate that BAL and TPC diagnose bacterial pneumonia in MV patients with similar accuracy. Culture results from both techniques showed excellent qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement.\r"

Lepidoglyphus destructor, common insect allergen, mouse urine, rat urine, and cattle epithelium. The most abundant allergen present was A. fumigatus followed by L. destructor. This study provides initial data on barn aerobiology and demonstrates for the first time the abundance of L. destructor allergens in North American dairy barns. More comprehensive study of barns, poultry houses, confinement houses for swine, and other agricultural environments from various geographic locations is needed to define the allergen levels to which millions of farm workers are exposed each day. While most of the allergens were expected, the presence of airborne allergens reactive with antisera to Dermatophagoides suggests indirectly that substantial amounts of pyroglyphid mites are present in some barns.\r"

  ".W": "Repeated bronchoprovocation with adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) in atopic, nonasthmatic subjects produces a state of refractoriness to the nucleotide that may be due either to depletion of preformed mediators from airway mast cells or down-regulation of purinoceptors on the surface of these cells. To investigate this further, we compared the effect on immediate allergen-provoked bronchoconstriction of preceding repeated challenges with histamine and AMP in eight atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects. In three successive AMP concentration-response studies, the geometric mean PC20 AMP increased from 275.3 to 1154.3 (p less than 0.01) and 1976.7 (p less than 0.01) mg/ml, respectively, whereas no significant similar increase in PC20 occurred with repeated histamine challenges. Refractoriness to AMP was not associated with any significant decrease in airways responsiveness to histamine. When compared with the response after repeated provocation with inhaled histamine, repeated exposure of the airways to AMP potentiated, rather than inhibited, immediate allergen-induced bronchoconstriction by a mean 57 +/- 22.6% (p less than 0.05) when the data were expressed as the area under the FEV1-time response curve. The ability of airways that have been rendered less responsive to inhaled AMP to exhibit an increased response to allergen suggests that tachyphylaxis to AMP is unlikely to be caused by depletion of preformed mast cell-derived mediators such as histamine.\r"

We have examined the effects of theophylline on opsonized zymosan-induced superoxide anion (O2-) release from guinea pig eosinophils harvested from the peritoneal cavity and from human eosinophils obtained by differential centrifugation of blood from patients with peripheral eosinophilia. Theophylline at high concentration (10(-3) M) inhibited O2- release by 27.6 +/- 9.4% (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05), whereas at clinically relevant concentrations (10(-6) and 10(-5) M), it significantly potentiated this by 26.8 +/- 9.9% (p less than 0.05) and 36.9 +/- 6.3% (p less than 0.01), respectively. 8-phenyltheophylline (10(-7) to 10(-3) M), which like theophylline inhibits adenosine receptors but does not inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, produced potentiation at all concentrations. Preincubation of eosinophils with adenosine deaminase (0.1 U/ml) enhanced O2- release by 72.4 +/- 15.2% (p less than 0.01), whereas addition of adenosine (3 x 10(-8) to 10(-6) M) reversed the potentiation induced by theophylline (10(-5) M) in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition was greater with the A2-selective analog N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine than the A1-selective analog phenylisopropyladenosine, suggesting that A2-receptors are involved. In human eosinophils we have demonstrated a similar effect of theophylline and adenosine on O2- release. Our results indicate that therapeutic concentrations of theophylline may potentiate eosinophil activation in vivo by competing with circulating adenosine for eosinophil A2-receptors. This would be consistent with the lack of effect of theophylline on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which may be related to eosinophilic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Although the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes are known to be potent bronchoconstrictors, the relative aerodynamic site of response to these compounds is controversial. We determined the decrease in maximal expiratory flow rates (Vmax) from partial and maximal flow-volume curves in seven asthmatic subjects after inhalation of aerosols of histamine or leukotriene C4 (LTC4) while breathing air or a mixture of 80% helium and 20% oxygen (He/O2). Density dependence (DD) of maximal expiratory flow was determined from partial expiratory flow volume curves by an isovolumic comparison of maximal expiratory flows with subjects breathing He/O2 with those obtained while breathing air. Measurements were made before and after inhalation of aerosols generated from graded concentrations of each constrictor agent. An aerodynamic site of response to LTC4 more central than for histamine was indicated by a significant (p less than 0.02) increase in DD with the former but not with the latter agonist. The ratio of Vmax at 30% vital capacity determined from maximal and partial maneuvers (M/P) was routinely higher at baseline while breathing He/O2 compared to the corresponding values with air, suggesting a degree of peripheral obstruction that was reversed by a deep inhalation. Obstruction induced by LTC4 inhalation resulted in a greater increase in M/P compared with baseline when air was the test gas (p less than 0.02). This was not observed when He/O2 was the test gas. Similar effects on M/P were not induced by histamine aerosol inhalation, consistent with a central airway response to LTC4 that was not affected by volume history.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The more severe the obstruction, the greater was the constrictor effect of a DI; as lung function improved with intensive treatment, including corticosteroids, the constrictor effect diminished. Thus, we believe the constrictor effects of a DI relate to the degree of inflammation in the obstructive process. These longitudinal data relating severity to the effects of a DI were nearly identical to previously published cross-sectional data in a group of patients with spontaneous asthma with widely different levels of lung function. It is possible that the response to a DI in a given asthmatic subject serves as a functional marker for the predominant mechanism for obstruction.\r"

Collateral resistance (Rcs) in anesthetized male mongrel dogs was measured before and after periods of elevated airflow, or before and after hypocapnic challenge, using a wedged bronchoscope technique. A dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist (nifedipine) was ineffective in preventing or even attenuating AIB in the canine lung periphery. Treatment with nifedipine did not affect the response of peripheral airways to aerosolized acetylcholine, indicating that receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCC) and/or release of calcium from intracellular stores were unaffected by this drug. Despite the ability of a calcium agonist (BAY K8644) to enhance responses to a hypocapnic challenge, it did not alter peripheral airway responses to dry air. Neither nifedipine nor BAY K8644 affected airway wall temperature at any time during the dry air experiments. We conclude that dihydropyridine receptors do not play a significant role in initiating AIB in the canine lung periphery.\r"

Little is known, therefore, about relationships between the menstrual cycle and airway function in asthmatics who do not complain of PMA or in normal subjects. We investigated airway function in both of these groups for three or four consecutive menstrual cycles. Daily records of asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates were maintained by 11 asthmatics and 29 normal control subjects. Standard spirometry and serum estradiol and progesterone levels were measured during the follicular, midluteal, and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Airway reactivity to methacholine was tested during the follicular and luteal phases. The normal group showed no significant changes in symptoms, peak flow rates, spirometric parameters, or airway reactivity. Although the asthmatic group also demonstrated no significant changes in spirometry and airway reactivity, asthma symptoms (shortness-of-breath, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness) deteriorated significantly (p less than 0.001) from the follicular to the luteal phase, as did the morning peak flows of the asthmatics (p = 0.045). Airway function and reactivity were not related to hormone levels in either group. This study indicates that asthmatics not previously aware of PMA will record a premenstrual worsening of asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates. These changes are not related to a deterioration in spirometry and airway reactivity or to the absolute levels of circulating progesterone and estradiol.\r"

To evaluate the relationship of nocturnal asthma to sleep, eight asthmatics with unstable asthma (seven with history of nocturnal wheeze) and four reference subjects were submitted to all-night polysomnography, including the continuous evaluation of esophageal and supraglottic pressure (with two catheters) as well as of airflow (with a face mask), so as to derive total lung resistance, supraglottic resistance, and, by subtraction lower respiratory resistance (Rlr). Stage 3-4 was characterized by the highest peaks in Rlr and by longer episodes of bronchoconstriction; conversely, neither the onset nor the remission of the latter were specifically related to any sleep stage. Considering episodes remitted with an awakening. Stage 3-4 was marked by higher Rlr peaks than during REM sleep. We conclude that sleep plays a contributory role in the multifactorial pathogenesis of nocturnal asthma, with a higher susceptibility during slow-wave sleep, probably related to a decreased responsivity to resistive loads.\r"

Previous studies in CCHS have shown decreased or absent ventilatory responsiveness to both hypercarbia and hypoxia. However, hypoxic responsiveness during wakefulness has not been systematically studied. We studied hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses during wakefulness in five children with CCHS (6 to 11 yr of age). To measure the hypercapnic response, the children rebreathed a hyperoxic hypercapnic mixture until PaCO2 reached 56 to 69 mm Hg. For the hypoxic response, the children rebreathed a hypoxic gas mixture, at mixed venous PCO2, until SaO2 had fallen to less than 78%. We found that the ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia were very variable (linear correlation coefficients ranging from -0.44 to +0.63 for hypercapnic responses and from -0.15 to +0.77 for hypoxic responses), with no significant change from baseline in response to either stimulus. There was no evidence of progressive ventilatory stimulation despite increasing stimulus. Additionally, these children had no subjective sensation of dyspnea or discomfort. This establishes that hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory control is absent during wakefulness. Chemoreceptor control (peripheral and central) is, therefore, defective in all states in children with CCHS. We speculate that the defect in CCHS lies in central integration of the central and peripheral chemoreceptor signals.\r"

After adjustment for age and cigarette smoking status, using multiple logistic regression, lifetime alcohol consumption was a significant predictor of chronic cough and chronic phlegm, but not of any wheeze or persistent wheeze. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that lifetime alcohol consumption was also a predictor of lower levels of FEV1 in a model that included age, pack-years of cigarette smoking, and an interaction between alcohol consumption and pack-years. The interaction between smoking and alcohol consumption was in a direction opposite to the independent effects of alcohol and smoking, suggesting a protective effect of alcohol with heavier amounts of smoking. Additional study is needed to further assess the relationship between respiratory symptoms and alcohol consumption, and between pulmonary function and alcohol consumption.\r"

Forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity were standardized for body size by dividing by the square of the height (FEV1/ht2, FVC/ht2).

In men and women under 70 yr of age and women over 70 yr of age, FEV1/ht2 was inversely related to mortality after adjustment for age, smoking, and respiratory symptoms.

An increased energy expenditure for respiration might explain the increased caloric requirements and weight loss seen in this patient population. We measured the oxygen cost of augmenting ventilation (O2 cost) using an open circuit technique with dead-space stimulation of ventilation in nine normally nourished (greater than 90% ideal body weight) and in 10 malnourished (less than 90% ideal body weight) patients with COPD as well as in seven normal control subjects. O2 cost was significantly elevated in the malnourished patients with COPD (4.28 +/- 0.98 ml O2/L ventilation) relative to the normally nourished group (2.61 +/- 1.07) and the normal control subjects (1.23 +/- 0.51) (p less than 0.001). The measured resting energy expenditure (REEmeas) was also increased compared with predicted values (REEpred) in the malnourished population (REEmeas/REEpred = 94.57 +/- 6.21% for control subjects, 105.5 +/- 19.66% for normally nourished patients with COPD, and 119.4 +/- 11.69% for malnourished patients with COPD) (p less than 0.005). The malnourished population was characterized by a greater degree of hyperinflation (RV/TLC = 0.55 +/- 0.09 for normally nourished versus 0.69 +/- 0.06 for malnourished patients) and inspiratory muscle weakness (PImax = 51 +/- 16.5 for the normally nourished and 34 +/- 12.2 for the malnourished population). We conclude that malnourished patients with COPD are characterized by a relative increase in resting energy requirements and, specifically, increased energy requirements for augmenting ventilation. This increase in energy requirements may result from the increased mechanical work load associated with severe COPD and/or a reduced ventilatory muscle efficiency.\r"

In five subjects, the energy cost of breathing against the loads, and thus the calculated efficiency of the respiratory muscles, was reproducible on repeated measurements. In all subjects, the calculated efficiency varied while breathing with low loads but was relatively constant at loads that resulted in a mouth pressure of 20 to 60% of the subjects' maximal static inspiratory pressure (PImax). The mean efficiency calculated between 20 to 60% of PImax in 30 normal subjects (15 males and 15 females) ranged between 1.54 and 7.98%. It was significantly greater in males (5.41 +/- 0.43%) (mean +/- SEM) than in females (2.41 +/- 0.17%). There was no relationship between efficiency and body size, but the efficiency correlated with inspiratory muscle strength (PImax). We suggest that measurement of the efficiency of the respiratory muscles over a spectrum of incremental threshold loads is a simple, noninvasive, and reproducible method of assessing respiratory muscle performance and may have clinical application.\r"

Hyperoxia did produce specific changes in the relative content of fatty acids present in lung microsomes and mitochondria of both vitamin E-supplemented and vitamin E-deficient rats. Changes were noted to occur in saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The total amount of lung lipids extractable in the microsomal fractions decreased after hyperoxia in both the vitamin E-supplemented and the vitamin E-deficient animals with no changes occurring in extraction of lung mitochondrial total lipids. Decreases in lung mitochondrial fatty acids caused by hyperoxia occurred in the same fatty acids in both the vitamin E-supplemented and the vitamin E-deficient animals with few polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) being affected. Decreases in lung microsomal fatty acids occurring during hyperoxia were different in the vitamin E-supplemented animals from those in the vitamin E-deficient animals with many more PUFA decreasing in the vitamin E-deficient group. The greatest number of PUFA found to decrease after hyperoxia when comparing all the different groups occurred in the microsomal fraction of the vitamin E-deficient rats. These data suggest that vitamin E-deficient animals have increased peroxidation of lung microsomal PUFA or a decrease in production of lung microsomal PUFA in vivo during a hyperoxic exposure.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of bradykinin on ciliary activity and its modulation by peptidases in cultured rabbit tracheal epithelium in vitro. Bradykinin (10(-7) M) elicited a rapid, transient increase in ciliary beat frequency (CBF) from the baseline values of 1,031 +/- 25 to 1,388 +/- 38 beats/min (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.001), followed by a decline to a steady-state value of 1,180 +/- 30 beats/min, which was still greater than the baseline CBF. This ciliostimulation was dose-dependently inhibited by the B2-receptor antagonist (D-Arg,Hyp3,Thi5.8,D-Phe7)-bradykinin but not by the B1-receptor antagonist (Des-Arg9,Leu8)-bradykinin. Nifedipine, Ca2+-free medium, indomethacin, the phospholipase A2 inhibitor mepacrine, and the methyltransferase inhibitor 3-deazaadenosine reduced the change in CBF. Involvement of tachykinins, leukotrienes, prostaglandin D2, or thromboxane A2 was ruled out because bradykinin's action was not affected by (D-Pro2,D-Trp7.9)-substance P, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or SQ29548, an antagonist for prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane A2. Bradykinin also increased prostaglandin E2 release (p less than 0.01), an effect that was abolished by indomethacin and Ca2+ deficiency. The CBF dose-response curve for bradykinin was shifted to lower concentrations by 1 log U by the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (p less than 0.01), whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was without effect. These results suggest that bradykinin interacts with B2-type receptors and stimulates ciliary activity through Ca2+-dependent prostaglandin E2 release, and that neutral endopeptidase may play a role in modulating the effect of bradykinin on airway mucociliary transport.\r"

In this study we have investigated the effects of subchronic cigarette smoke exposure in the hamster on the PNE cells and their peptide content. Daily exposure to standard research cigarette smoke for as long as 90 days led to progressively higher levels of serum calcitonin (iCT) as well as higher lung tissue iCT and the gastrin releasing-like peptides or mammalian bombesin (MB). Subsequent to a 30-day period during which there was no further exposure to smoke, serum levels returned to control levels, but the lung levels of both iCT and MB remained higher than control levels. Also, after the 90 days of exposure, immunocytochemistry revealed an increase in the number of iCT-containing PNE cells. This increase in the number of PNE cells correlated well with the increased iCT content of the lung tissue. We conclude that subchronic cigarette smoke exposure causes an increase in pulmonary levels of iCT and MB, which may be linked to the observed proliferative response of the PNE cells.\r"

In this immunohistochemical study, we have investigated the localization and distribution of Met- and Leu-Enk immunoreactivities in airways and pulmonary vessels of guinea pigs and rats. Immunoreactivities to both peptides were found in nerve fibers and nerve terminals distributed mainly to the trachea and major bronchi, and were especially prevalent in the smooth muscle layer, in the lamina propria, and around tracheal and bronchial glands, but not in the epithelium. Few immunoreactive nerve fibers were detected in smaller bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Enkephalin-immunoreactive nerve fibers were also localized in the walls of pulmonary and bronchial vessels. Within airway microganglia, immunoreactivity was observed in a few nerve terminals, but not in ganglion cell bodies. Met- and Leu-Enk immunoreactive nerve fibers showed similar distribution patterns, though minor differences were noted between the two species: Enk-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the smooth muscle layer were more abundant in guinea pigs than in rats, whereas those in mucous glands were richer in rats than in guinea pigs. These results document the presence of Met- and Leu-Enk immunoreactivity in nerve fibers supplying guinea pig and rat airways and pulmonary vessels, and provide a morphologic basis for the view that enkephalins are likely neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "Silica instillation causes a massive accumulation of surfactant phospholipids and the appearance of hypertrophic type II cells in the rat. We have examined the metabolic consequences of silica instillation with a special emphasis on surfactant protein A (SP-A), the major glycoprotein of surfactant. Fourteen days after instillation of 10 mg of silica, the amount of phospholipids in lavage increased 14-fold and the amount of SP-A increased 10-fold. The phospholipid composition of lavage material from silica-treated animals was altered by a reduction in the percentage of phosphatidylglycerol and an increase in phosphatidylinositol. The percentage of saturated phosphatidylcholine did not change. Type II cells isolated from rats treated with silica could be separated into cells of normal size and of increased size by centrifugal elutriation. There was an increase in phospholipid and SP-A content in the larger type II cells isolated from silica-treated rats relative to type II cells from control rats (by 45% and 70%, respectively, when expressed per micrograms protein; p less than 0.01). Activities of the phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes cholinephosphate cytidyltransferase, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase, and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthetase increased (nmol/min/mg cell protein) in the hypertrophic type II cells relative to type II cells from control rats (by 40%, 112%, and 95%, respectively, p less than 0.05). Incorporation of (1-14C)-acetate was also increased in hypertrophic type II cells relative to type II cells from control rats (by 43%, p less than 0.05). The only difference in the distribution of acetate incorporated into individual lipids was a slight increase in the percentage incorporated into phosphatidylinositol. Although the increase in phosphatidylcholine found in the lavage could be due to increased synthesis as reflected by the changes in enzymatic activity and rate of acetate incorporation, the reduction in phosphatidylglycerol in lavage and in type II cells could not be explained simply by a reduction in synthesis on the basis of available data. There was a marked increase in SP-A content in lavage and in type II cells isolated from silica-treated rats without a significant change in the relative abundance of SP-A mRNA. This dissociation of SP-A mRNA abundance and apoprotein content suggests that factors other than transcription may be important for the observed accumulation of SP-A in silica-treated rats. We conclude that the phospholipidosis and proteinosis that occur subsequent to silica instillation in the rat lung are not solely attributable to increase in the rates of synthesis of these components.\r"

In a recent light microscopic investigation, ALP was detected in the connective tissue matrix of the lung. The present immunoelectron microscopic study was performed in order to extend our knowledge about the exact localization of ALP in the extracellular matrix of the lung. Both elastin and ALP were detected in central and peripheral human lung specimens using specific antibodies in a two-step, gold-labeling procedure. ALP could be demonstrated in the parenchymal matrix of the alveolar walls exclusively in association with the amorphous elastin fibers. In addition, the subepithelial connective tissue of the bronchial wall also showed a clear labeling for ALP, which was present exclusively over the elastin fibers. The results of this study strongly suggest that ALP play a modulating role in destructive pulmonary diseases such as emphysema in which degradation of elastin fibers by elastase is thought to occur.\r"

This phenomenon, termed adaptation, has been produced in unanesthetized rats. Rats exposed to O3 (0, 0.35, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm) for 2.25 h for 5 consecutive days showed an increased frequency of breathing and a decreased tidal volume on Days 1 and 2 of exposure at all O3 concentrations. However, by Day 5 these breathing responses to O3 were diminished in rats exposed to 0.35 and 0.5 ppm, but not in rats exposed to 1.0 ppm. In addition, a flow limitation in smaller airways was observed after the second day of exposure to 0.5 ppm O3 that initially attenuated and then disappeared by the fifth day of exposure. In contrast to these findings, a light microscopic examination of fixed lung tissue sections from rats exposed to 0.5 ppm indicated a 5-day progressive pattern of epithelial damage and inflammation in the terminal bronchiolar region. A sustained 37% increase in lavageable protein was also observed over the course of the 5-day exposure regimen to 0.5 ppm. Lung glutathione increased initially, but it was within the control range on Days 4 and 5. Lung ascorbate was significantly elevated above control levels on Days 3 and 5. These data suggest that attenuation of the pulmonary function response to O3 occurs in laboratory rats with repeated exposure while biochemical and morphologic aspects of the tissue response continue to progress.\r"

Enhanced IgE and IgG antiovalbumin (OA) antibody production was observed in mice first instilled intratracheally with the aluminum compounds and then given OA aerosol exposure. Histopathologic observations after instillation of fly ash and aluminum silicate showed that a large number of macrophages had ingested the compounds. However, the amount of free compound and the distribution of macrophages were different in mice given fly ash from those given aluminum silicate.

Using a simulator with road films, six subjects with untreated, severe apnea performed worse than did a control group of seven normal subjects on both highway and city/rural driving (p less than 0.05). Using a personal computer program simulating a monotonous highway drive, 12 subjects with untreated sleep apnea performed worse than 12 control subjects. The patients with apnea hit a greater number of road obstacles during their 30-minute simulated drive than did the control subjects (44 +/- 52 in patients with apnea versus 9 +/- 7 in control subjects, p less than 0.05). Six patients with apnea hit fewer road obstacles after treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) than before treatment (29 +/- 19 before CPAP versus 13 +/- 8 after CPAP, p less than 0.05). We conclude that: (1) driving simulator performance of untreated subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea is worse than that of control subjects; (2) driving simulator performance of subjects treated with nasal CPAP improves.\r"

During an 18 month period the records of all patients at this institution who were undergoing chronic hemodialysis, via a forearm modified arterial bovine heterograft, and who were successfully treated by digital manipulation for graft thrombosis were examined. Thirteen patients who underwent 30 successful graft manipulations constituted the study group. Bedside manipulation attempts were performed from one to 72 hours from the period of last known function. Complete response to the technique was indicated by the appearance of a pulse and panrhythmic bruit and thrill throughout the conduit. The average duration of restored flow was 58.6 days (range one to 430 days). No serious or life threatening complications (e.g. problems related to pulmonary thromboembolism) were observed. Conduit thrombosis secondary to faculty cannulation, prior hypotension, or extrinsic compression was amenable to the technique; however, when occlusion was secondary to an intrinsic problem in the graft (stenosis of the venous or arterial anastomosis), operative revision was required. If successful, the technique allows for immediate dialysis access without the need for additional measures. The procedure has negligible morbidity and can spare the patient considerable time and expense.\r"

The base is invaginated into the stomach wall to create a tight valve. After skin closure, the terminal 1 cm is excised and the mucosa is sutured flush with the skin. A #10 French tube is inserted and positioned perpendicularly. A gastrostomy thus created will allow intermittent cannulation without leakage of gastric contents. Results of this procedure in 26 patients show a postoperative wound infection incidence of 3.8 per cent. With a mean follow up of 257 days, the gastrostomy was continent in 87 per cent of patients.\r"

Thirty-one per cent of the units tested contained greater than 40 micrograms/ml fibrinogen degradation products, and a total of 86 per cent contained greater than 10 micrograms/ml fibrinogen degradation products. Fresh frozen plasma is often used in the treatment of critically ill trauma and surgery patients, and especially in severely burned patients, who are immunosuppressed by the nature of their injury. Since fibrinogen degradation products have been shown to have both in vitro and in vivo immunosuppressive effects, administration of fresh frozen plasma to these patients should be carefully evaluated in light of its potential ability to worsen their already compromised immune status.\r"

Eighteen (64%) were men, and ten (36%) were women. A left adrenal mass was present in 16 (57%) patients, a right in 11 (39%) patients, and one (4%) patient had bilateral adrenal enlargements. Nineteen patients underwent an adrenalectomy. Ten were found to have adrenocortical adenomas, ranging is size from 2.5-4.0 cm in greatest diameter. Three were adrenocortical carcinomas (3.0, 5.5, and 8.0 cm). A necrotic mass (14.0 cm) was found in one patient. Two patients had myelolipoma, one had ganglioneuroma, and one had a suspected primary melanoma. Five patients were not operated upon and were followed by serial computed tomographic scans for variable periods; two died of unrelated cardiac problems, and one was lost to follow-up. Three patients underwent biopsy with benign pathology. The data indicate a high incidence of adenoma and carcinoma in patients with nonfunctioning adrenal tumors that measure more than 3.0 cm in diameter. These tumors have the potential to progress to malignant degeneration without any recognizable clinical or endocrine abnormalities. The authors thus conclude that all patients with \"nonfunctioning\" adrenal tumors that are larger than 3.0 cm in diameter should undergo surgical exploration and excision.\r"

Mild diabetes mellitus, weight loss, and anemia usually accompany the syndrome. However, only the presence of a peculiar cutaneous rash (necrolytic migratory erythema) and the finding of hyperglucagonemia on assay are reliable diagnostic features of the syndrome. Selective, celiac axis arteriography is the most valuable preoperative technique for localizing these neoplasms and their common liver metastases. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations are particularly helpful in defining the tumor cell nature (alpha-2 islet cell) and the peptide content (glucagon). When the tumor is benign (less than 30%), complete operative removal results in lasting cure; for malignant forms, surgical therapy is mainly palliative, and adjunctive chemotherapy should be administered. In this report, the importance of clinical recognition and operative and chemotherapeutic responses is illustrated in two patients. In each case, the characteristic dermatitis, diabetes mellitus, weight loss, anemia, and elevated plasmatic glucagon were present. Both patients had their tumors localized by selective angiography and underwent operative removal of the primary pancreatic lesion. In the case of benign glucagonoma, surgical excision was curative. In the malignant one, cytoreductive surgery plus adjunctive chemotherapy (dimethyltriazenomidazole-carboxamide resulted in prolonged survival and significant clinical improvement. Follow-up with serum glucagon assay has been useful in monitoring recurrence.\r"

The authors recently treated a patient who had a synchronous hepatoma and adenocarcinoma of the colon. This appears to be the first report of these tumors presenting synchronously. The patient had both tumors resected and has no evidence of recurrence ten months later. This case illustrates the need to seek both colonic and extra-colonic synchronous tumors in patients discovered to have a colon cancer.\r"

DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of free-living subjects and a cohort of retirement-home residents with an average follow-up of 6.7 years and 5.5 years, respectively (range, 1 to 15 years for both cohorts). SETTING: General community and a retirement home. SUBJECTS: Volunteer sample of white women (386 free-living and 135 living in a retirement home) who were free of disease and were not receiving medication known to affect bone metabolism. In terms of physical condition subjects ranged from the totally independent to the wheelchair-bound. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A radial bone mass measurement was done at the initial visit. Subsequent non-spine fractures were reported by the subjects at follow-up visits, which were less than a year apart in most cases, and verified with medical records. Cox regression was used to model time to first fracture as a function of age and bone mass. These analyses showed that for every 0.1 g/cm decrement in bone mass, the relative risk of fracture was 2.2 (CI, 1.7 to 2.8) for the free-living and 1.5 (CI, 1.2 to 1.9) for the retirement-home residents. Baseline age did not predict the risk of fracture in either cohort, and controlling for baseline age did not reduce the relative-risk estimates of bone mass. Similar analyses also showed that bone mass was a statistically significant predictor for first hip fractures (n = 30) among the nursing-home residents (relative risk, 1.9; CI, 1.4 to 2.7) and first forearm fractures (n = 10) among the free living (relative risk, 3.6; CI, 1.9 to 6.8). For both cohorts, the 8-year probability of any nonspine fracture was about 80% for subjects with initial bone mass less than 0.6 g/cm and was less than 10% for subjects with initial bone mass greater than 0.8 g/cm. Similarly, those in the retirement home with bone mass below 0.6 g/cm had a 6-year probability of hip fracture of 43%, compared with a 17% risk for those with greater bone mass. CONCLUSION: A single bone mass measurement of the radius is predictive of future nonspine fractures at all sites, and at both the forearm and the hip. Baseline age was not a significant predictor of fracture within either cohort. Relative-risk estimates were not dissimilar across fracture sites.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective study of physiologic variables before and during intervention. SETTING: Referral-based pulmonary disease clinic at a U.S. Army medical center. PATIENTS: Eighteen ambulatory retired servicemen (age 68 +/- 6 [SD] years) with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] 31% +/- 10% of predicted). INTERVENTION: Altitude simulation equivalent to 2438 meters (8000 feet) above sea level in a hypobaric chamber. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Radial artery catheter blood oxygen tension in the patients declined from a ground value (PaO2G) at sea level of 72.4 +/- 9 mm Hg to an altitude value (PaO2Alt) of 47.4 +/- 6 mm Hg after 45 minutes of steady state hypobaric exposure. The PaO2G correlated with PaO2Alt (r = 0.587; P less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the preflight FEV1 reduced the variability in PaO2Alt not explained by PaO2G in the equation: PaO2Alt = 0.453 [PaO2G] + 0.386 [FEV1% predicted] + 2.440 (r = 0.847; P less than 0.001). Residuals from two previously published formulas using PaO2G also correlated with FEV1 (r greater than or equal to 0.765; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial blood oxygen tension declined to clinically significant levels in most patients during hypobaric exposure. When combined with the preflight arterial PO2 at ground level (PaO2G), the measurement of the preflight FEV1 improved prediction of PaO2 at altitude (PaO2Alt) in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

PATIENTS: Six patients with skin-biopsy-proven multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. All had skin nodules and polyarthritis. INTERVENTION: Five patients received cyclophosphamide (dose range, 1.25 to 2.2 mg/kg body weight) and one patient received chlorambucil (0.1 mg/kg). Therapy was administered from 6 to 24 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In five patients treated with cyclophosphamide a response was seen within 4 months. Four patients eventually had a complete remission and one had almost a complete remission. The four patients in complete remission had cyclophosphamide therapy discontinued after 6, 12, 16, and 18 months. Three of the four patients remained in complete remission off therapy at 6, 6, and 22 months, whereas one had a recurrence after 6 months. The one patient given chlorambucil went into a complete remission and stopped treatment after 12 months. He remained in complete remission 32 months after stopping medication. CONCLUSION: Our experience with patients with aggressive multicentric reticulohistiocytosis shows that alkylation therapy is warranted. We conclude that a response to an alkylating agent may be expected. Whether after treatment for 6 to 18 months most patients may be able to discontinue the drug and remain in remission has yet to be shown. The rarity of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis precludes the possibility of a double-blind study.\r"

The laudable changes in the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) examination, which take effect in 1991, will not solve this problem. We believe that the causes of the flight away from medicine as a career are several and represent the combined effect of changes in the practice of medicine itself and their negative impact on the profession, as well as deeply-seated shifts in values, attitudes, and aspirations among the young people in our society.

Using bovine corneal tissue, we measured stress-strain relationships of tissue at different locations in the cornea. From this data we calculated Young's modulus of elasticity of five specimens at peripheral and central corneal locations. Increasing levels of stress produced increased resistance to stretch, a property typical of soft biologic materials such as cornea. Linear regression analysis of the data showed that the elastic modulus of the peripheral tissue was greater than that of central tissue at all values of applied stress. These linear relationships were statistically different, using an analysis of covariance, indicating that peripheral corneal tissue is stiffer than central corneal tissue. This information supports the suggestion that a peripheral circular ligament of corneal tissue exists and helps to maintain the curvature of the cornea. It is the disruption of this ligament that is believed to cause some of the change in corneal curvature when radial keratotomy is done.\r"

He began to hallucinate, and clear fluid-filled blisters appeared on his skin and mouth. Severe photophobic epiphora, conjunctival injection, and punctate keratitis were also observed. Several hours after local administration of corticosteroids and antibiotic eye drops, his eyelids swelled severely, the corneas became covered by pseudomembranes, and later, in attempting to open the eyelids, the skin peeled off and the eye lashes fell out. Treatment consisted of artificial tear eye drops, and intravenous antibiotics and steroids. His condition improved gradually, visual acuity became 6/15 in both eyes, and a superficial punctate staining of the cornea was observed. The Schirimer test showed lacrimal hyposecretion. A tarsal conjunctival biopsy showed a complete absence of goblet cells. Vitamin A was administered topically and systemically. After three months of treatment with Vitamin A, tear secretion was almost normal, and conjunctival biopsy indicated a regeneration of goblet cells.\r"

This observation is consistent with those seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy where retinal damage from high myopia, trauma, or other cause typically protects that eye from the advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy. As in this case, the eye with long-standing uveitis did not have proliferative sickle retinopathy.\r"

The presence of \"peripheral lacy cortex\" occurred 37 times more frequently in the advanced group than in the immature group. These two parameters might explain the difference in postoperative visual acuity where only 79% of the advanced and 92% of the immature cataracts had 20/40 visual acuity or better (P less than 0.01). Our results suggest that patients should be informed of the increased risks in waiting to have surgery done.\r"

Postrevision, 21 patients (84%) had achieved either a good or an excellent result. Complications were limited to one case of significant vocal cord edema and another instance of vocal cord hemorrhage. No patient required a tracheotomy. No prosthesis extruded. We feel that phonosurgery has the advantages over traditional Teflon injection of allowing the patient's head to be in a neutral position during the operation; of allowing local anesthesia; of permitting a predictable, graduated end point of the procedure; and of being infinitely adjustable, with preservation of the vocal cord mucosal wave.\r"

When these ten cases are added to the six original cases presented in an earlier report (1981), certain conclusions can be drawn. The success or failure of these procedures, which is judged by the ability to decannulate the patient, appears to be related to the extent of the initial injury. We discuss the indications for the composite nasal septal graft and the use of additional treatment, including stents, steroid injections, dilatations, and flaps. In conclusion, the addition of these ten cases to the original six cases of composite nasal septal grafts now provides the opportunity to review indications and contraindications for the use of this graft in the management of advanced laryngotracheal stenosis.\r"

Vocal fold ulceration and vocal fold motion abnormalities were the most common lesions. Patients with abnormal larynges were followed up after discharge from the intensive care unit. Most of the identified injuries resolved without intervention. However, silent aspiration was identified frequently in patients with vocal fold paresis and was thought to be a significant factor in postoperative pulmonary complications. Early identification of significant laryngeal trauma and/or vocal fold paresis in critically ill patients is important for both postoperative pulmonary care and voice rehabilitation. This pilot study demonstrated that documentation of the laryngeal examination is feasible in critically ill patients in an intensive care unit setting.\r"

Four active electrodes shaped into compressible platinum-iridium soft-balls are fed through the mastoid cavity and across the facial recess, and placed into cavities that are made over the cochlear turns that project to the medial wall of the middle ear. One hard-ball active electrode is placed into the round window niche. One hard-ball reference electrode is placed into the hypotympanum. An additional electrode wrapped around the lead wire assembly can be used as an alternative reference electrode. A specially designed insertion needle facilitates the placement and the fixation of the soft-ball electrodes.\r"

Results indicated that for EVA rotation, the subjects' responses were of larger magnitude and less variable with EOD than with EC. However, for EHA rotation, responses were of larger magnitude and equally variable with EC as compared to EOD. Our data also indicated that the quality of the EHA response with EC was altered because eyelid closure influenced the amount of periodic gaze. We conclude that eyelid closure has an effect upon both canalocular and otolithocular reflexes and suggest that both EVA and EHA rotational testing be performed with EOD rather than with EC.\r"

The use of five chain-specific anticytokeratin monoclonal antibodies and one broad specific anticytokeratin monoclonal antibody showed the divergent behavior of middle ear epithelium compared with the cytokeratin expression of the other two types of epithelium. Middle ear epithelium was characterized by the presence of cytokeratins 4, 8, 18, and 19, whereas in both cholesteatoma and meatal epidermis cytokeratin 10 predominated. Furthermore, cholesteatoma showed an infrequent focal presence of cytokeratins 4, 18, and 19. The similarity between cholesteatoma and meatal epidermis with respect to morphology, and the presence of cytokeratin 10 support an epidermal origin of cholesteatoma. However, a metaplastic origin cannot be excluded, because of the infrequent occurrence of a small amount of cytokeratins 4, 18, and 19 in cholesteatoma matrix that was not found in meatal epidermis but was a component of the cytokeratin pattern of middle ear epithelium.\r"

Approximately 13% of each patient group suffered adverse events, which were gastrointestinal in the majority and were transient.

Two animals received a continuous subcutaneous infusion of 25 mg/m2 per h for 12 or 24 h. AZT was measured in plasma by a reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatographic assay. Following intravenous bolus administration, AZT elimination was rapid, with a mean half-life of 1.2 h and a mean clearance of 318 ml/min per m2 (range, 200 to 441 ml/min per m2). The bolus subcutaneous dose was rapidly (time to peak concentration, 15 to 30 min) and nearly completely (fraction absorbed, 92%) absorbed without evidence of local tissue toxicity. With continuous subcutaneous infusion of AZT, the steady state was attained within 4 h and steady-state concentrations in plasma in the two animals exceeded 3.0 mumol/liter. No local tissue toxicity was observed at the infusion site. The subcutaneous route may be a practical alternative to intravenous administration of AZT and deserves further clinical study.\r"

All three strains were allowed to colonize surgical-grade disks of stainless steel, polymethylmethacrylate, and ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene for 24 h, and the disks were then exposed to various concentrations of antibiotics for 24 h. Surviving adherent bacteria were mechanically dislodged from the disks and quantitated by standard broth dilution plating techniques. Biomaterial-adherent RP-12 and SE-360 yielded approximately 10 times more CFU per disk than non-slime-producing SP-2 did. For all organisms, 10 times more bacteria bound to polymethylmethacrylate disks than to the other biomaterials. In general, bacteria adherent to biomaterials exhibited greater resistance to antibiotics than the same strains in suspension did. Resistance was independent of bacterial slime-producing characteristics and was related to the biomaterial colonized.\r"

The effect of this additional blood volume on drug disposition is unknown. In this study, we determined the pharmacokinetic parameters of gentamicin in 10 infants on ECMO. Gentamicin concentrations were determined by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from these concentrations by using a two-compartment model. Our study demonstrated a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 0.51 +/- 0.11 liters/kg, a figure similar to that in previous studies of full-term infants. The elimination half-life was found to be prolonged (mean, 573 +/- 263 min). The creatinine level in the plasma of the infants was found to be a statistically significant predictor of elimination half-life. Recommendations regarding initial dosing levels of gentamicin in infants on ECMO are made.\r"

Blood and urine samples were collected, and rimantadine concentrations were determined by a gas-chromatographic--mass-spectrometric method. There were no changes in the rate of absorption and the renal clearance of rimantadine when it was administered with cimetidine. Both parametric and nonparametric tests showed significant differences in the area under the concentration-time curve, apparent total clearance, and elimination rate constant between the treatments (P less than 0.01). The apparent total clearance was reduced by 18%, resulting in higher values for the area under the concentration-time curve in the presence of cimetidine. However, the wide therapeutic index of rimantadine renders these changes of little, if any, clinical consequence.\r"

Pharmacol. 36:3815-3821, 1987) was examined in vivo in mice and in vitro with human bone marrow progenitor cells. Four successive daily intraperitoneal injections of tubercidin at 5 mg/kg per day produced 100% mortality in mice within 3 to 5 days following the first injection, with massive peritonitis and intestinal obstruction secondary to abdominal adhesions. Coadministration of NBMPR-P (25 mg/kg per day) protected the mice from the lethality of tubercidin and allowed the repetition of the regimen for a second time with 100% survival until the mice were sacrificed 22 days following the first injection. Blood chemistry, hematological studies, and histological examinations showed no evidence for injury to the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, mesentery, or peritoneal mesothelium. In vitro, tubercidin alone had a direct dose-dependent inhibitory effect on myeloid and erythroid human bone marrow progenitor cells, and consistent inhibition (50%) of granulocyte-macrophage CFU (CFU-GM) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) occurred at 2 to 3 nM tubercidin. At higher doses, BFU-E were more sensitive to tubercidin toxicity than CFU-GM. Complete inhibition (99%) of BFU-E colonies occurred at 10 nM tubercidin, while complete inhibition of CFU-GM occurred at 100 nM. NBMPR-P at 10 to 100 nM protected CFU-GM and BFU-E from tubercidin toxicity in a dose-dependent matter.\r"

Hasobe, J. G. McKee, D. R. Borcherding, and R. T. Borchardt, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 31:1849-1851, 1987) to have anti-vaccinia virus activity with reduced murine L-929 cell toxicity compared with the prototype compound neplanocin A. In this study, we showed that the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of compounds 1 and 2 can be related to intracellular concentrations of AdoHey, which are elevated in cells treated with these inhibitors of AdoHcy hydrolase. For example, concentrations of analogs 1 and 2 that produce 50% inhibition of vaccinia virus replication caused only slight elevations in intracellular levels of AdoHcy (from 50 [controls] to 100 to 125 [drug-treated cells] pmol/mg of protein) and elevations in the ratios of AdoHcy/S-adenosylmethionine (from 0.05 to 0.1 [controls] to 0.15 to 0.19 [drug-treated cells]). In contrast to the extreme susceptibility of virus replication to slight elevations in intracellular AdoHcy, cell viability was quite tolerant to higher levels of this metabolite. For example, concentrations of analogs 1 and 2 that produced 50% inhibition of L-929 cell replication caused significant increases in intracellular levels of AdoHcy (to 825 to 950 pmol/mg of protein) and elevations in AdoHcy/S-adenosylmethionine ratios (approximately 1.3). These data make it possible to assign a therapeutic index of 7 to 8 to these compounds on the basis of the comparison of intracellular levels of AdoHcy that caused 50% inhibition of vaccinia virus replication with those that caused 50% inhibition of L-929 cell replication.\r"

Apparent total, renal, and nonrenal clearances and the volume of distribution at steady-state all decreased by 45 to 50% with the higher dose, and the elimination half-life was longer (8 +/- 2 versus 15 +/- 3 min). Mezlocillin exhibits low saturable binding in rat serum, ranging from 20 to 40% bound. Pharmacokinetic parameters based on free drug demonstrated dose-dependent characteristics similar to those with total drug. Use of the volume of distribution from the low dose allowed calculation of the true mean residence time. The linear relationship between dose and mean residence time from free concentrations yielded pooled Michaelis-Menten parameters. These were used as initial estimates in the simultaneous nonlinear fitting of the low- and high-dose mean free concentrations to a three-compartment model with sequential distribution and Michaelis-Menten elimination to describe the nonlinearity of mezlocillin disposition further.\r"

  ".W": "2',3'-Dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T) is a thymidine nucleoside analog which has potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity in vitro. We have studied its metabolism in cells to assist in determining its mechanism of action. D4T is metabolized in cells to the mono-, di-, and triphosphate nucleotides. Our data suggest that the initial conversion to the monophosphate is catalyzed by thymidine kinase. This enzyme has an affinity for D4T 600-fold lower than for thymidine and catalyzes the rate-limiting step in production of the triphosphate. Nevertheless, intracellular concentrations of the triphosphate approximately equal to the reported Ki for human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase are attained with extracellular concentrations of free drug as low as 0.05 microM. The pattern of phosphorylation is different from that of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), which has an affinity for thymidine kinase equivalent to that of thymidine and is easily phosphorylated. The rate-limiting step in formation of AZT triphosphate is conversion of mono- to diphosphate, and thus the monophosphate accumulates. On removal of D4T or AZT from the media, both triphosphates have an intracellular half-life of about 200 min, and this rate ultimately controls the rate of elimination of the drugs from cells. The differences in metabolism of D4T and AZT observed in vitro may be responsible for the differences in toxicity seen in vitro and in vivo and support the exploration of the clinical utility of D4T as an anti-human immunodeficiency virus agent.\r"

A bolus dose of drug (14 mg/kg of body weight) was given, and blood and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after CPB for 96 h. Creatinine, albumin, and total and free ceftriaxone concentrations in plasma were measured. The ceftriaxone free fraction (ff) in vitro was estimated by equilibrium dialysis, and the in vivo ff was obtained by the ratio of renal clearance due to filtration to creatinine clearance. Pharmacokinetic parameters were based on concentrations of total drug and free drug. Albumin decreased from 3.10 +/- 0.29 g/dl presurgery to 1.42 +/- 0.17 g/dl and recovered to 2.46 +/- 0.26 g/dl on postoperative day 4. CPB markedly increased the in vitro ff, which was reversed by protamine post-CPB (ff pre-CPB, 0.15 +/- 0.01; during CPB, 0.53 +/- 0.20; post-CPB, 0.16 +/- 0.02). The in vitro ff exceeded the in vivo ff (0.53 +/- 0.20 versus 0.24 +/- 0.07), probably due to continued free fatty acid release caused by heparin during dialysis. Clearances based on free drug decreased, and the renal clearance due to filtration increased (7.6 +/- 2.8 versus 15.0 +/- 4.5 ml/min) while the creatinine clearance decreased (114 +/- 29 versus 72 +/- 28 ml/min) during CPB. Diminished binding owing to low albumin and free fatty acids explain this behavior. Lower binding also increased the volume of distribution (154 +/- 41 ml/kg) and extended the half-life (15 +/- 6 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A randomized three-way crossover trial was conducted to compare the release of the NMTT side chain from three NMTT-containing antibiotics. Single 2-g doses of moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotetan were given, followed by serial blood and urine sampling. The concentrations of the parent compound and the NMTT side chain in plasma, urine, and the reconstituted antibiotic solution were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Peak NMTT concentrations ranged from 0.42 to 16.50 micrograms/ml and were significantly higher after moxalactam administration than after cefoperazone or cefotetan administration (P less than 0.01). The NMTT trough concentrations (12.5 h) ranged from nondetectable to 2.47 micrograms/ml and tended to be greater following cefoperazone administration.

In contrast, urinary recoveries of NMTT were 57.4 +/- 26.2, 73.6 +/- 44.3, and 29.7 +/- 22.9 mg following moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotetan, respectively. The amount of NMTT formed in vivo and excreted unchanged, as assessed by subtracting in vitro NMTT formation from NMTT urinary recovery, was significantly higher after cefoperazone than after moxalactam or cefotetan administration (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from May 1985 to August 1987. A total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. The mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). The diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. The tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. Isolates from blood were 12 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus hominis, 1 Micrococcus sedentarius, 1 Enterococcus faecalis, 3 Streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable Streptococcus sp. At the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). Of these 14 patients, one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. Thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower, 23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). Side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. These side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study with enoxacin, a new antibacterial agent of the quinolone-azaquinolone class, investigated the efficacy of a single dose compared with 3 days of treatment. A total of 154 outpatients with symptoms of simple cystitis were treated in an open randomized study with enoxacin, either one 600-mg dose or 200 mg twice a day for 3 days. A urine sample was collected for culture before treatment, 7 to 10 days after treatment, and 4 to 6 weeks after treatment. Seventy-three patients had positive bacterial cultures from the pretreatment urine sample; the predominant pathogen was Escherichia coli, along with a number of other gram-negative organisms and Staphylococcus spp. Of these patients, 33 received a single dose of enoxacin and 40 were treated for 3 days. Follow-up examination at 7 to 10 days showed negative urine cultures in 76% of patients from the single-dose group and 89% from the multiple-dose group, a difference that was not statistically significant (P = 0.665, Fisher's exact test). A number of patients were lost to follow-up at 4 to 6 weeks. However, of those who did attend, only three patients were shown to have relapsed or become reinfected (two in the multiple-dose group and one in the single-dose group). Enoxacin was well tolerated in both groups of patients; the few adverse events were mostly mild.\r"

  ".W": "A drug-susceptible Trypanosoma brucei brucei stock, a multidrug-resistant T. b. brucei stock, and a T. b. evansi stock resistant to two commercial trypanocides were adapted to a feeder layer-free culture system. Bloodstream forms were grown continuously in a liquid medium at 37 degrees C in 4% CO2 in air. Samples of trypanosome populations in the logarithmic growth phase were incubated with various concentrations of commercial and experimental compounds. Growth inhibition was monitored after a 24-h incubation and quantified by comparing the number of generations between control and drug-treated cultures. Some of the experimental compounds [taxol, formicin B, thioridazine, Ro 15-0216, and DL-alpha-(difluoromethyl)ornithine hydrochloride monohydrate] showed activity against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant trypanosomes. Other compounds [sinefungin, 1,3,5-triacetylbenzene tris(guanylhydrazone)trimethanesulfonate hydrate, and 9-deazainosine] which inhibited the growth of drug-susceptible trypanosomes showed little or no effect upon drug-resistant parasites. Gossypol, however, had no antitrypanosomal effect on either trypanosome stock. The results obtained in this study correlate with observations obtained from drug screening in mice. The main advantages of the described in vitro screening assay are as follows: (i) lower amounts of drugs are required, (ii) results are obtained more rapidly, (iii) animals are not necessary, and (iv) the method is less labor intensive. These advantages result in an economical and rapid assay for primary drug screening.\r"

  ".W": "Routine in vitro screening of a new synthetic series of 3,5-substituted 2-methylisoxazolidines revealed that three imidazole analogs (PR 967-248, PR 967-234, and PR 969-566) and, to a lesser extent, a triazole analog (PR 988-399) exerted rather potent antifungal activity against three systemic and four dermatophytic classes of fungi. When tested in vivo for ability to eradicate Candida vaginitis in the rat, the triazole derivative, PR 988-399, was effective after oral administration. In this in vivo test for efficacy, PR 967-234 and PR 969-566 reduced but did not eradicate the infection, while PR 967-248 was inactive. PR 988-399 was, moreover, 4- to 13-fold less potent than the three imidazoles in inhibiting testosterone synthesis in isolated rat Leydig cells. After oral or intravenous administration, PR 988-399 and PR 969-566 elicited the fewest cardiovascular and behavioural side effects in conscious dogs. The rat safety study consisted of oral dosing followed by evaluation of the exploratory motor activity of the naive animals in a novel environment. Motor activity was suppressed least by PR 988-399 and most by PR 969-566. In a battery of mouse behavioural-neuromuscular-drug interaction tests, PR 988-399 and PR 969-566 produced the fewest central-behavioural-neuromuscular signs. These efficacy-safety evaluations were performed with ketoconazole as a positive reference standard. The sequence of drug testing with respect to efficacy-safety considerations appears to be a suitable approach for early detection of orally active antifungal agents such as PR 988-399 for more advanced development.\r"

BMY 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. BMY 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. The antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of BMY 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. The in vitro activities of BMY 40062 were influenced by pH and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of BMY 40062 against P. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. In mouse protection tests, the efficacy of BMY 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. BMY 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. Compared with ofloxacin, BMY 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. BMY 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated Staphylococcus aureus.\r"

  ".W": "Cefmetazole is a cephamycin antibiotic which is resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of cefmetazole, including its intravascular and interstitial fluid distribution, by using the skin window (SW) technique. A 2-g dose of cefmetazole was given intravenously over 30 min to each of 12 healthy adult male volunteers every 6 h for nine doses. Plasma levels were assayed at predetermined intervals after doses 1, 5, and 9. Interstitial fluid levels were determined by the SW technique. Antibiotic levels were assayed by the agar well bioassay technique. A concentration-versus-time plot indicates that cefmetazole is rapidly distributed, with mean peak levels in plasma equal to 126 micrograms/ml at the end of the half-hour infusion. The mean plasma half-life was 1.1 h. Plasma and tissue distribution constants permitted calculation of theoretical levels in tissue. Parallel elimination slopes for SW and theoretical tissue level showed that the SW model distribution kinetics are closely related. The area under the curve for the SW was 73.9 mg.h/liter. This was comparable to the theoretical level in tissue, which was 96 mg.h/liter. Furthermore, the area under the curve of theoretical tissue level/plasma was 0.6 and that of SW/plasma was 0.47. These results demonstrate that the SW technique yielded a result quite close to the theoretical tissue level. Ultrafiltration analysis indicated that as cefmetazole levels in plasma increased from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml, plasma protein binding of the antibiotic dropped from 85 to 65%. Finally, 60 to 70% of the drug was recovered from the urine as biologically active drug over 6 h postinfusion.\r"

To investigate this, gentamicin has been administered intraperitoneally in doses of 50, 60, or 80 mg/kg per day for 12 days in groups of rats receiving either a normal or a low sodium intake. Alterations in creatinine clearance have been measured. Salt depletion resulted in an enhanced nephrotoxic response with a shift in the dose-response curve to the left. Administration of sodium ticarcillin to rats with a salt-depleted intake at a dose sufficient to replace sodium intake conferred an equal degree of protection to rats with a normal salt intake. We report that the obligatory salt supplement with ticarcillin is sufficient to account for the renal sparing effect of the combination treatment without having to infer a direct chemical interaction of penicillin with the aminoglycoside.\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drawn 0.5, 3, 6, or 12 h after the last infusion. Serial plasma and CSF samples were also obtained from patients with ventricular drainage. Concentrations in CSF ranged from 0.96 +/- 0.15 to 1.80 +/- 0.29 microgram/ml, depending on sampling time. The percentage of penetration in ventricular fluid, expressed as the ratio of the CSF area under the curve from 0 to 12 h to the plasma area under the curve from 0 to 12 h, was 73 +/- 6. Ofloxacin readily diffuses into CSF of patients with meningitis or ventriculitis and may be useful for treatment of CSF infections caused by susceptible pathogens.\r"

Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (mean inoculum, 0.9 X 10(8) CFU) with one of four strains initially susceptible to quinolones and treated with a single 25-mg/kg dose of pefloxacin. This therapy produced a net decrease of bacterial counts in the peritoneal fluid, but with the of the isolates, posttherapy (PT1) strains emerged with decreased susceptibilities to quinolones (4- to 1,024-fold), to the structurally unrelated antibiotics (4- to 16-fold) chloramphenicol and trimethoprim, and sometimes to tetracycline and beta-lactam compounds. In a second set of experiments, new mice were similarly infected with PT1 strains and treated with up to five 25-mg/kg doses of pefloxacin. Compared with parent isolates, PT1 strains produced similar disease and peritoneal bacterial count in the control animals. In treated mice posttherapy (PT2) strains emerged that showed 8- to 64-fold increases in quinolone MICs compared with the PT1 strains inoculated. All PT1 and PT2 strains showed altered outer membrane protein patterns, principally marked by a decreased 37,000-molecular-weight band generally accompanied by an increased 42,000-molecular-weight band. Whole cells from all PT1 and PT2 strains, exposed to [14C]pefloxacin for 15 to 60 s, bound significantly less radioactivity than the corresponding parent strains. After partial purification, DNA gyrase extracted from the most resistant isolates (one PT1 and the PT2 strains) showed a 100- to 450-fold 50% inhibitory concentration increase for pefloxacin. Altogether, pefloxacin can select in vivo two types of resistant strain, one with only decreased permeability and another with decreased permeability combined with altered DNA gyrase.\r"

The subjects were randomly assigned to four oral treatments of 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 mg of cefetamet pivoxil according to a four-by-four Latin square design. After an overnight fast, the drug was administered 10 min after a standard breakfast. It was found that both the rate and extent of prodrug absorption, measured as cefetamet adsorption, were reduced with increasing doses. The time to maximum concentration of cefetamet in serum was delayed from 4.00 +/- 0.81 to 4.88 +/- 0.96 h (P less than 0.05) when the dose of cefetamet pivoxil was increased from 500 to 2,000 mg. The dose-normalized values of area under the curve from 0 h to infinity for cefetamet and fraction of dose excreted as cefetamet were reduced by averages of 10.3 and 12.5%, respectively, over the dose range studied (P less than 0.05). The changes in rate and extent of prodrug absorption are thought to be the main factors contributing to the nonlinear relationship between maximum concentration in serum and dose. The change in absorption characteristics of cefetamet pivoxil with dose is, however, expected to have few clinical consequences because the magnitudes of these changes are comparable with their respective intragroup variations.\r"

All Bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of G. vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. varied. Among the skin bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant.

Thirteen patients (11.5%) developed renal toxicity, with significant increases from 48 to 96 h in both peak and trough amikacin levels (6.7 +/- 4.7 [standard deviation] days before the serum creatinine rose). The nontoxicity group had no change or even showed decrements in amikacin levels in plasma. A higher nephrotoxicity risk was seen in patients with increments greater than 1 microgram/ml between 48 and 96 h, with odds ratios of 16.4 for trough, 8 for peak, and 7.2 for both levels. We suggest that an increment of at least 1 microgram/ml in amikacin levels in plasma from 48 to 96 h may predict the appearance of renal toxicity.\r"

Isolated valve replacement was performed in 11 patients. Combined procedures included valve replacement with myocardial revascularization (7 patients), multiple valve procedures (5 patients), and ascending aortic plication (2 patients). Fifteen patients (60%) were in New York Heart Association functional class III and 10 (40%) were in class IV preoperatively. The operative mortality was 20% and late mortality was 20% (mean follow-up, 36 months). Isolated valve replacement carried a 9% early and 0% late mortality, whereas combined procedures of any type had a 16% early and 20% late mortality. Only 7 patients (28%) had a completely uncomplicated postoperative hospitalization. Twenty patients were discharged after a mean hospital stay of 18 +/- 16 days. Their mean New York Heart Association functional class was 1.6 +/- 0.66. The 1-year and 2-year actuarial survival rate is 79% and 69%, respectively. A significant increase in operative mortality is seen when valve replacement is combined with myocardial revascularization or an additional valve procedure. Late clinical improvement, as judged by return to an independent life-style, justifies this approach for select patients.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that developmental differences in adenine nucleotide degradation might facilitate recovery by quantitating depletion of high-energy phosphates in nine-day-old embryonic (n = 9) and 15-month-old adult (n = 14) chicken hearts at 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals of normothermic ischemia in vitro. Nucleotides adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate and nucleosides adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Several observations in metabolite degradative response to ischemia were noted. The embryonic myocardium maintained higher adenosine triphosphate and adenosine monophosphate levels over the course of the investigation than did mature myocardium. Moreover, the adult group showed an increase in diffusible nucleoside pool metabolites. Relative immaturity of enzymes responsible for nucleotide degradation may facilitate postischemic recovery by preserving nondiffusible high-energy phosphate precursors to participate in salvage resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate.\r"

Patients whose predicted postoperative pulmonary function, by spirometry and xenon 133 regional pulmonary function studies, was a forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 1.65 L, forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 58% of the preoperative value, forced vital capacity greater than 2.5 L, or forced vital capacity greater than 60% of the preoperative value had a lower operative mortality rate (p less than 0.05).

In 20 pigs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 30 minutes before cardiopulmonary bypass. In the HCA group (n = 10), the heart was arrested with a hyperkalemic cold crystalloid solution, whereas in HFA animals (n = 10), the heart was vented and allowed to fibrillate spontaneously without cross-clamping. Miniature pH probes monitored intramyocardial pH during 45 minutes of arrest (HCA or HFA, both with systemic and topical myocardial cooling) and during two hours of coronary reperfusion. Hypothermic fibrillatory arrest did not ameliorate the acidosis in the ischemic (left anterior descending) region; indeed, after two hours of coronary reperfusion, there was a trend toward more acidosis in the postischemic left anterior descending territory in the HFA group. However, HFA did prevent acidosis in the nonischemic (left circumflex) territory. Infarct size expressed as percent of region at risk was 18.1% +/- 3.2% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in the HCA animals and 18.8% +/- 4.4% in the HFA animals. These results demonstrate that HFA offers no advantage over HCA in protection of regionally ischemic myocardium in a model with minimal collateral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "After Norwood's initial report of successful first-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome in neonates, the occurrence of distal aortic obstructions, shunt problems, and late deaths have led to modifications in the surgical technique. Between January 1986 and December 1987, 12 neonates from three to 16 days old underwent stage I palliation with the same objectives. An open atrial septectomy was always performed. The pulmonary artery bifurcation was transected from the main pulmonary artery and closed with an aortic homograft patch. The aortotomy was begun 2 cm below the patent ductus arteriosus insertion and extended across the transverse arch and down the ascending aorta. The neoaorta was constructed using the hypoplastic ascending aorta-transverse aortic arch, the main pulmonary artery, and an aortic homograft augmentation patch. The homograft is hemostatic and pliable, and molds well in forming the neoaorta. A 4-mm shunt was inserted between the right innominate artery and the right pulmonary artery in 5 patients and the neoaorta and the pulmonary artery bifurcation patch in 7 patients. The early systemic oxygen saturation was optimized at 75% to 80% with hyperventilation, high concentration of inspired oxygen, sodium bicarbonate, and the frequent use of vasopressors to maintain an arterial blood pressure of 65 to 75 mm Hg. Two patients (17%) died early after operation; 1 had severe right ventricular dysfunction and both had severe tricuspid regurgitation. There were 2 late deaths at 7 and 13 months, of sepsis and hypoxia. The 8 survivors (67%) continue to do well over follow-up. The preoperative tricuspid regurgitation has remained stable in 3 survivors and disappeared in 2 survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During regular bacteriological surveillance of cardiac surgical equipment and patients, the Cell Saver apparatus (CSA) was prospectively evaluated to determine if it represented an additional risk for infection. Nineteen patients were studied. After each operation, the effluent from the CSA was sterilely sealed for subsequent culture. A total of 42 aerobic and 42 anaerobic cultures were made. Postoperatively all patients were evaluated daily for four days and before discharge for clinical evidence of infection. Four patients had positive CSA cultures without evidence of postoperative clinical infection. Five patients in whom postoperative infectious complications developed had negative CSA cultures. Ten patients had negative CSA cultures and no evidence of postoperative infection. We conclude that the CSA does not appear to contribute to the risk of infection in cardiac surgical patients and that it is a safe adjunct to cardiac surgery.\r"

One hundred forty-seven patients received a Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprosthesis and 106, a Hancock valve. There were no significant differences in preoperative clinical characteristics between the two groups. Cumulative follow-up was 1,375 patient-years. At 10 years, 93% +/- 2.5% of the patients in the Carpentier-Edwards group and 85% +/- 7.8% of those in the Hancock group were free from valve-related death (not significant), and 95% +/- 2% and 91% +/- 3.8%, respectively, were free from thromboembolism (not significant). At 10 years, 65% +/- 7.2% of the patients in the Carpentier-Edwards group and 66% +/- 7.2% of those in the Hancock group were free from structural valve deterioration (not significant), and 64% +/- 6% and 59% +/- 7.3%, respectively, were free from reoperation (not significant). We conclude that the first generation of Carpentier-Edwards and Hancock prostheses produce comparable long-term results in the mitral position.\r"

Preoperative clinical features included effort dyspnea in 81%, new-onset angina in 44%, a new murmur in 89%, and an abnormal opening or closing sound associated with the prosthetic valve in 56%. Symptoms were present for 1 week or more before reoperation in 86%, although many patients were referred only after acute exacerbation of heart failure and development of pulmonary edema. Noninvasive studies confirmed prosthetic valve malfunction in only 33%, but cardiac catheterization documented thrombotic obstruction in all 15 patients in whom it was performed. In 14 of the 27 patients, prothrombin time was in the therapeutic range at the time of admission. Prompt reoperation for valve replacement or thrombectomy was performed with an operative mortality of 11%, and long-term outcome was satisfactory in all but 1 hospital survivor. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the diagnosis of thrombosed heart valves in patients with mechanical heart valves who are seen with nonspecific symptoms.\r"

In 5 patients, lung cancer was suspected preoperatively on the basis of the radiographic findings. Intraoperatively, the gross appearance of the pleura resembled lung cancer in 6 patients; the parietal pleura was involved in 3, and pleural indentation was present in the other 3. Two patients underwent partial resection, as the frozen section revealed a benign tumor, and 5 patients underwent lobectomy for what appeared to be lung cancer or a large mass. All of the patients are doing well without other therapy. We believe the lesion should be differentiated from lung cancer at operation by frozen sections, even though this proved pertinent in only 2 of the 7 patients. Limited resection is recommended if the lesion is an inflammatory pseudotumor.\r"

The hearts were preserved for 24 hours by coronary perfusion with either oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution (group C) or crystalloid cardioplegic solution with fluorocarbon added (group FC). The perfusion pressure was kept at 20 mm Hg, and myocardial temperature was maintained at 4 degrees C. Group FC demonstrated better recovery in developed pressure and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure compared with group C. The postpreservation end-diastolic pressure in group C increased significantly compared with the baseline value (value obtained before preservation). On the other hand, group FC showed no significant increase of end-diastolic pressure after preservation. Group FC released a significantly lower level of creatine kinase into its perfusate than did group C. Ultrastructural changes after preservation in group C showed severe ischemic injury, but there was no evidence of ischemic injury in group FC. The use of fluorocarbon emulsion proved beneficial to myocardial protection in long-term preservation of canine hearts.\r"

The major indications for surgical intervention included hemoptysis (14 patients), drug resistance (5), possible neoplasm (3), and bronchiectasis (2). Impaired pulmonary function was common. Surgical therapy generally necessitated lobectomy, sometimes resulted in substantial blood loss, and had a total major and minor complication rate of 46%.

  ".W": "From 1975 to 1987, 1,127 elderly patients underwent 1,223 valve replacements with the Carpentier-Edwards standard or supraannular porcine bioprostheses in 1,147 operations. Of the total patient population seen during these years, 33.5% receiving a standard porcine bioprosthesis and 48.6% receiving a supraannular bioprosthesis were 65 years of age or older. Of this elderly patient population, 465 patients were between 65 and 69 years old; 618 patients, 70 and 79 years old; and 52 patients, 80 years old and older. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 635 patients, mitral valve replacement in 417 patients, tricuspid valve replacement in 2 patients, and multiple-valve replacement in 80 patients. The cumulative follow-up was 3,957 patient-years. Early mortality was 9.5%: 7.3% for the 65- to 69-year-old group, 10.7% for the 70- to 79-year-old group, and 15.4% for the group 80 years old and older. Late mortality was 5.5% per patient-year: 4.2% per patient-year for the 65- to 69-year-old group, 6.3% per patient-year for the 70- to 79-year-old group, and 14.1% per patient-year for the group 80 years old and older. Valve-related causes contributed to 7 early deaths and 33 late deaths. The overall patient survival, including operative deaths, was 70.7% +/- 1.6% at 5 years and 47.8% +/- 3.7% at 10 and 12 years. The freedom from all valve-related complications was 52.1% +/- 6.1% at 10 and 12 years. The overall rate of valve-related complications was 5.0% per patient-year (fatal complications, 1.13% per patient-year). The overall rate of thromboembolism was 2.3% per patient-year and the freedom from thromboembolism, 69.6% +/- 5.2% at 10 and 12 years. The freedom from structural valve deterioration was 80.8% +/- 8.1% at 10 and 12 years: 71.7% +/- 11.0% at 10 and 12 years for the 65- to 69-year-old group, 97.9% +/- 1.2% at 10 years for the 70- to 79-year-old group, and 100% at 12 years for the group 80 years old and older. At 10 and 12 years, the freedom from valve-related death was 83.7% +/- 4.3% and the freedom from reoperation, 73.3% +/- 8.6%. The freedom from valve-related death, residual morbidity from thromboembolism and anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, and reoperation was 61.7% +/- 7.0% at 10 and 12 years. The clinical performance of porcine bioprostheses in the elderly patient population has been excellent. The early mortality increases in patients 70 years old or older.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In 22, the missile lodged in the heart after its direct injury and in the remaining 2, after the bullet injured a systemic vein. Immediately after the cardiac injury, 7 of the 22 patients were seen with cardiac tamponade (3 also had hemothorax), 11 were seen with hemothorax, 5 were asymptomatic, and 1 was in shock. Seven patients underwent emergency thoracotomy; the bullet was removed in 3, but in the remaining 4 patients, it was not located. In the other 17 patients and in the 4 in whom the bullet could not be found during emergency thoracotomy, the diagnosis was suspected from the chest roentgenograms and confirmed by cardiac fluoroscopy or angiocardiography. Eight patients with retained bullets underwent elective operation; the bullet was removed from 7 and in 1 it was left embedded in the right ventricular septum. All 10 patients who underwent excision of the missile recovered without complication except 1 in whom pericarditis developed, and all were followed for up to 17 years. All 14 patients with a retained missile in the heart had no cardiac symptoms referable to the bullet and were followed for up to 15 years. This experience suggests that the management of patients with a bullet of .38 caliber or smaller that is retained in the heart should be individualized according to the patient's clinical course and the site of the bullet and that in select patients, bullets left in the heart are tolerated well.\r"

  ".W": "Between June 1981 and June 1988, we placed pleuroperitoneal shunts in 16 patients for the management of refractory chylothorax on the Pediatric Surgical Service, University of Virginia. The cause of the chylothorax was caval thrombosis from central venous catheters in 5 patients, idiopathic in 3, and mediastinal lymphangioma in 2, and in 6, it developed after a cardiac procedure. Chylothorax in each patient was unresponsive to thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, and dietary manipulations. A Denver double-valved shunt system is currently employed and is implanted using general anesthesia. Manual pumping is required postoperatively for several months. Twelve (75%) of the 16 patients had excellent results with complete elimination of the chylothorax and resolution of symptoms. In 10 of these 12, the shunt has been removed. Four had an unsatisfactory result: 3 had inferior vena cava hypertension, and 3 were low-birth-weight premature infants. Four patients seen early in this series required revision of the position of the pleural catheter, with successful drainage in each instance. Pleuroperitoneal shunting is a safe, simple, and effective treatment of chylothorax in infants and children. In view of our success in treating chylothorax with these shunts, we recommend early shunting before the development of nutritional or immunological depletion.\r"

Twelve percent of tumors were in the proximal third of the esophagus, 21% were in the middle third, and 67% were in the distal third. Adenocarcinoma accounted for 44% of all tumors, squamous cell for 55%, and adenosquamous for 1%. Six patients were in stage I, 14 were in stage II, and 80 were in stage III; no patient was in stage IV. Surgical procedures included 85 esophagogastrectomies with primary anastomoses, 11 with colon interposition, and 4 with Roux-en-Y small-bowel interposition. Six patients had radical laryngopharyngo-esophagectomy with gastric or colopharyngeal anastomosis. Operative mortality was 3%. The mean survival of stage I patients was 182 months; stage II patients, 25 months; and stage III patients, 18 months.

However, most of the results reported have been in patients aged less than 65 years. Between April 1985 and September 1988, we performed mitral valve reconstruction in 176 patients using Carpentier's classification and technique for repair. Ages ranged from 15 to 86 years (mean age, 63 years). Of the repairs, 96/176 (55%) had concomitant cardiac procedures. Patients aged 65 years or more accounted for 52% (92/176) of the population and 35% (65/176) were more than 70 years old. Hospital mortality (30 day) was 4% (4/84) in the group aged less than 65 years. Hospital mortality for the group aged more than 65 years was 12% (11/92), compared with an overall 8.5% mortality. These results suggest an increased morbidity with mitral valve repair in the patients aged more than 65 years, but this group represents an even higher risk group with mitral valve replacement.\r"

In this investigation, mediastinal irrigation with gentamicin was used in 12 patients who had experienced problems after a heart operation. The regimen employed for mediastinal irrigation with gentamicin was equipotent with that using neomycin. We sought to determine the degree of absorption and risk of either inadequate or toxic blood levels that might follow gentamicin absorption. Irrigation periods were short, ranging from one to four days and determined by measurements of plasma gentamicin concentration using radioimmunoassay evaluation. Systemic gentamicin absorption occurred in all patients. Toxic levels of higher than 8.0 micrograms/mL occurred and were size related, ie, correlated with smaller body weight and surface area, and sex related, ie, female sex. Larger-sized patients often had inadequate levels. Despite the potential risk from toxic blood levels, major increases in serum creatinine levels were not seen. These findings suggest that monitoring of plasma gentamicin levels during mediastinal irrigation with gentamicin is mandatory to avoid both inadequate treatment and toxicity.\r"

In 6 cases, the involved nodes were grossly abnormal at operation, requiring frozen section interpretation. In the first 2 patients, the areas of nodal infarction were misinterpreted as necrotic tumor. Permanent sections from all 8 patients showed no evidence of tumor in the infarcted nodes. Factors predisposing to nodal infarction included right-sided tumor, central tumor, and large mediastinoscopic biopsy specimens. In all instances, the infarcted nodes were subcarinal and/or main bronchial. In 2 patients, left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurred after mediastinoscopy. Necrosis in distal nodal areas should be recognized as a complication of thorough mediastinoscopic sampling, presumably due to interruption of arteries supplying these nodes. Awareness of this phenomenon by surgeons and pathologists may avert falsely positive gross or microscopic diagnoses of metastatic malignancy at thoracotomy.\r"

Operative death occurred in 19 patients (9.7%). Nine (4.6%) postoperative complications, excluding stricture formation, were related to the use of stapling instruments, including two operative deaths (1.0%). Anastomotic leaks and gastrotomy staple line leaks were the most common complications (four each). In 7 patients (3.6%) the circular stapler tore the esophagus; anastomotic leaks subsequently developed in 43% of these patients. After we began oversewing gastrotomy staple lines in 1984, we experienced only one gastrotomy leak due to a technical error. Postoperative stricture formation occurred soon after resection and responded well to one or two dilations. It is better to err on the side of choosing too small a stapling head when performing an esophageal anastomosis because this may reduce the incidence of leaks, and further strictures are easily dealt with.\r"

Excellent or good results were obtained in 83% of patients. Lesser procedures were performed in 106 patients, and 117 had only staging examinations. Although surgical palliation of esophageal cancer with resection or bypass provides good results, the cost is high. Improvements in palliative results require reduction in operative mortality, increased accuracy of preoperative staging, continuing use of laser therapy, and increased use of chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiotherapy and operation.\r"

Most of the men presented in the third decade of life, a peak distribution not seen in women. Half of the patients were hypertensive at presentation. Two thirds of the patients had not used intravenous drugs. The addicts were younger than nonaddicts (mean +/- SD age, 27 +/- 4 years vs 35 +/- 13 years), had greater proteinuria (10 +/- 5 g/d vs 6.3 +/- 5 g/d), and exhibited more glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis on biopsy. Of the 18 patients (8 addicts) remaining under our care, 4 addicts and 4 nonaddicts became uremic within 3 years. We conclude that even in the absence of drug addiction, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a common cause of primary glomerular disease in black adults, in whom it may represent a nonspecific glomerular reaction to injury. The prognosis in the nonaddict may not be different from that in the addict, but more patients need to be studied.\r"

We found the frequency of major clinical/autopsy discrepancies to be similar to those in previous studies (35%), but in only 7% of cases were these likely to have affected therapy/outcome. Ther was no difference in the frequency of major discrepancies between age groups. There were significantly more \"unexpected\" minor discrepancies in the older patients, probably related to the multiplicity and complexity of their problems, but these would have affected therapy/outcome in only 1 (3%) of 37 cases. The most common causes of 136 clinical \"errors\" in 151 autopsies were, in order of frequency: a diagnostic \"blind spot,\" a conscious decision not to pursue a clinical finding (not a real \"error\"), failure to account for a symptom or sign, atypical presentations, and inadequate follow-up of abnormal laboratory findings. There were no differences between the geriatric and adult groups in terms of frequency or cause of the errors. We conclude that (1) there is no difference in the diagnostic accuracy regarding cause of death between geriatric and nongeriatric patients in the acute hospital environment, and (2) closer attention to basic knowledge and clinical skills and a special focus on judgment and reasoning skills, utilizing autopsy findings among other things, will lead to even further improvement in clinical care at all ages.\r"

The women placed more importance on personal manner and concern, and their greater satisfaction with these behaviors may have contributed to higher ratings of overall satisfaction. In contrast, the men seemed less satisfied with their intern's personal concern; they also tended to weigh such concern less in determining overall satisfaction. Men considered the presentation of information by the physician and the establishment of dialogue with the physician as more important. The amount of such dialogue may have been inadequate to generate higher levels of overall satisfaction for the men patients.\r"

The education period did not influence the ordering of partial thromboplastin time tests, despite a significant posteducational change in surgeons' attitudes. In contrast, administrative restriction of coagulation test orders led to a 50% decline on four of the five study wards. We conclude that an educational intervention followed by administrative restriction may be considered an acceptable means of overcoming clinician reluctance to change well-established but redundant clinical policy.\r"

Although DNR patients in intensive care units had comparable illness levels before and at the time of the order, treatment levels were reduced when the order was written. In general, DNR patients received more nursing care than other patients. Hospital mortality was 59.8% for DNR, 83.9% for CPR, and 1.7% for control patients. We identified diagnosis, prior activity, hospital unit, and employment status as predictors of DNR. According to documentation, 20% of patients participated in the DNR decision. Introduction of a DNR progress note form significantly improved documentation of the DNR process, but further efforts to improve DNR practice and patient participation are recommended.\r"

Half of the residents in each group also were randomized to receive patient education (patients received literature and notices of overdue tests). We reviewed a sample of each physician's medical records to assess performance of seven tests during 9-month periods before and after initiating the interventions. Cancer screening reminders increased performance of six of seven tests; audit with feedback, four of seven tests; and patient education, one of two targeted breast cancer screening tests. The results indicate that the cancer screening reminders strategy was the most effective in promoting the performance of routine cancer screening tests.\r"

The patient was being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of her admission to our institution. Further laboratory and clinical evaluation at our facility revealed depressed CD4 lymphocytes, oral candidiasis, and cryptococcal meningitis with indeterminate results on serologic testing for HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The biopsy specimen of a lesion in the right occipital lobe of the brain documented Toxoplasma gondii, indicating a clinical diagnosis of AIDS. To our knowledge, our study presents the first known patient with HIV-2-associated AIDS in the United States. Our patient provides further evidence that HIV-2 causes severe immunodeficiency and opportunistic infection. The condition should be suspected in the face of normal or repeatedly equivocal HIV-1 antibody test results in the presence of clinically documented AIDS.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups--those doing flexion and those doing extension back strengthening exercises. All patients received instructions on posture, lifting techniques, and the use of heat for relief of symptoms. After three months, only 27% of patients who were instructed in flexion exercises had moderate or severe pain and only 32% were unable to work or had limited their work. Of the patients who were instructed in extension exercises, 67% had moderate or severe pain and 61% were unable to work or had limited their work. At three-year follow-up, only 19% of the flexion group had moderate or severe pain and 24% were unable to work or had limited their work. The respective figures for the extension group were 67% and 61%. The overall recovery rate after three months was 58% for the flexion group and 6% for the extension group. At three years these figures improved to 62% for the flexion group and dropped to 0% for the extension group. The literature is scarce regarding the applicability of conservative treatment programs for lumbar spondylolisthesis. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that if a conservative treatment program is elected, back flexion or isometric back strengthening exercises should be considered. The three-year follow-up data presented here lend support to this point of view.\r"

Healthy men (n = 20) with no previous treadmill exposure were alternately assigned to the experimental (practice) or control (no practice) group. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate pressure product (RPP), step cadence (CAD) and perceived exertion (PE) were recorded at the end of each work load of the practices and/or tests. We observed no significant differences in these variables over the common work loads for the first practice session in the experimental group and the exercise test in the control group (p greater than 0.05). The two groups were homogeneous with respect to fitness and magnitude of arousal on initial exposure to the treadmill. During the submaximal test, HR, SBP, RPP, CAD, and PE were systematically lower for the experimental group than for the control group. The SBP and RPP were significantly lower in the experimental group (p less than 0.01). The CAD tended toward statistical significance (p less than 0.07), whereas HR and PE were not significantly different for the two groups (p greater than 0.05). When the four common work loads were compared over the two practices and the exercise test for the experimental group, SBP and CAD were significantly higher for practice 1 than for practice 2 and the test (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Abnormalities in autonomic function have been postulated to interfere with exercise conditioning and may predispose individuals to exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Twenty-nine individuals with diabetes mellitus underwent standardized noninvasive testing for the evaluation of cardiovascular autonomic function and graded exercise before entering a rehabilitation program. Inadequate responses of heart rate to respiratory variation were observed in 28 patients, abnormal heart rate responses to postural maneuvers were seen in 23, and postural hypotension was noted in nine. Individuals with symptomatic postural hypotension were able to exercise using a stationary bicycle, but developed hypotensive episodes on walking or prolonged standing. Blood glucose consistently decreased by a mean of 76 (+/- 9) mg/dl after each exercise session, even though low levels of exercise were performed (2.9 +/- 0.2 metabolic equivalents, for 28 +/- 1 min). There was no relationship between the degree of autonomic neuropathy and the level of blood glucose fall. There was, however, a significant correlation (r = -0.59, p = 0.001) between the decrease in blood glucose level and the amount of regular insulin used in the routine morning dose. Precautions were taken to avoid hypoglycemia, and insulin and diet were adjusted accordingly to prevent severe hypoglycemic reactions.\r"

Then the patient tries to reproduce the course of the signal in the paretic limb. Patients received 12 to 30 treatments for upper and/or lower extremities. We measured maximum strength as expressed through the EMG signal; ability to perform the trained action as measured by specific grading systems; and general increase in movement competence during a Bobath movement test. Ten patients showed improved strength; four made marked progress in the performance of specific tasks with the upper extremity, as did four with the lower extremity. Four patients in each group improved in general movement. We recommend the integration of useful tasks into movement exercises in EMG biofeedback therapy.\r"

The subjects had a mean age of 24.2 years; 89.7% were men; and 51.7% of the injuries resulted from vehicular accidents. Most (93%) of the subjects perceived the ECU as increasing their independence. Operation of the telephone was indicated as the most important function (61%); control of television sets were second (21%) in rank. Of the subjects who worked or went to school, only two used their ECUs for those purposes. Subjects felt comfortable for longer periods without attendant care when the ECU was available. Some of the subjects felt that they had received inadequate training (30%) and that their attendants lacked understanding of the ECU (36%). Steps should be taken to increase the employment potential of ECU users by providing units with additional features and by increasing the training of both users and their attendants.

Contrasting patterns of errors across various language tasks provide evidence that the two patients' naming errors arose from different underlying deficits. The effectiveness of cueing hierarchies on improving each patient's written naming was demonstrated in single-subject experiments using a multiple baseline design. Although both patients exhibited acquisition and maintenance of written naming, only one showed generalization to verbal naming and to untrained stimuli. Different results are interpreted as a reflection of separate sources of the subjects' naming errors. It is concluded that determining the cognitive basis of an individual's naming difficulty may permit predictions concerning language behaviors that are likely to improve concurrently as a function of treatment. Also, reporting specific deficits of patients should allow other clinicians to select appropriate candidates for therapy procedures found to be effective in within-subject treatment experiments.\r"

Except for one incident, when the patient reinjured his spinal cord, he did not lose function that he had already attained.

In order to prevent this occurrence an electronic biofeedback device was designed and developed for use in the training of 3-point swing-through axillary crutch ambulation. It detects excessive weight bearing on the axillary bar during crutch ambulation and produces an audible signal which prompts the patient to make necessary adjustment to relieve load bearing on the axillary bar. The design and development of the biofeedback device is discussed in this paper.\r"

Definite JPsA (24 patients) was defined as arthritis associated, but not necessarily coincident, with a typical psoriatic rash, or arthritis plus at least 3 of 4 minor criteria: dactylitis, nail pitting, psoriasis-like rash, or family history of psoriasis. Probable JPsA (11 patients) was defined as arthritis plus 2 of the minor criteria. In 33 of 35 patients, the onset of arthritis was pauciarticular, but the disease followed a polyarticular course in 23 of 35. Chronic anterior uveitis (6 of 35), antinuclear antibodies (22 of 35), anticollagen antibodies (10 of 35), HLA-DR4 (2 of 28), and HLA-DR8 (5 of 28) occurred with frequencies similar to those seen in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. JPsA may have more in common with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis than with the seronegative spondylarthropathies with which it is traditionally associated.\r"

Genetic analysis indicated that the major histocompatibility complex (H-2), C5 hemolytic complement (Hc), Newcastle disease virus-induced interferon (IF-1), and athymic (nu/nu) loci were involved in regulating susceptibility to pristane-induce arthritis.

Patients with SLE showed a 70% decrease in poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis (P less than 0.001); this decreased synthesis persisted even with the addition of histones or DNase.

The RA specimens showed synovial lining layer hypertrophy and several focal accumulations of lymphocytes, both of which were absent in the reactive arthritis synovium. The percentage of cells expressing monocyte/macrophage markers was significantly higher in RA specimens. The percentages of cells expressing B and T cell markers were similar in both diseases. There was no significant difference in the expression of HLA-DR or DP by endothelium in the 2 diseases, but a marked increase in expression of HLA-DQ by endothelium was observed in the RA synovium versus that from patients with reactive arthritis. This overexpression of HLA-DQ was also seen in the interstitial cells of RA patients compared with reactive arthritis patients. In the reactive arthritis synovium, a significant population of cells (30%) was noted to be HLA-DR positive, and negative for macrophage and lymphocyte markers. Some of these cells had a dendritic morphology. The coexpression of HLA-DQ and HLA-DR may play an important role in antigen presentation and disease chronicity in RA.\r"

We theorized that the feeling of fatigue in patients with RA may be a manifestation of disturbance of sleep. Sixteen patients with chronic, active RA, who were selected for early onset of fatigue (less than 6 hours after morning awakening), were extensively evaluated by formal all-night polysomnographic recording and multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). Although no sleep deprivation was found, all patients had some type of marked disturbances of sleep, including unanticipated sleep apnea (2 patients), frequent movement of extremities (all 16 patients), and frequent arousal (all 16 patients). The alpha-delta sleep pattern was present in 13 patients, and 7 were found by MSLT to be hypersomnolent. None of the patients accurately recognized the degree of their sleep disruption. Our findings from the MSLT indicate that fatigue in patients with RA may be a manifestation of sleep fragmentation, rather than a nonspecific constitutional symptom.\r"

Our findings suggested that 4 CES-D items (i.e., \"I felt that everything I did was an effort,\" \"I felt hopeful about the future,\" \"My sleep was restless,\" and \"I could not get going\") may be influenced by aspects of the disease process and, thus, are not necessarily indicative of depression among persons with arthritis. The impact that these items have on the interpretation of CES-D scores was assessed in relation to 2 research issues: estimation of the prevalence and severity of depression in arthritis populations and identification of the determinants of depression among individuals with arthritis. Our results suggest that the original CES-D may overestimate the prevalence and severity of depression among patients with arthritis. The magnitude of this bias is modest, however. The results also suggest that in studies designed to identify the determinants of depression among individuals with arthritis, inclusion of the 4 items identified is unlikely to have any effect on study findings.\r"

  ".W": "Exocytotic secretion requires the interaction and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. This process could be mediated by specific recognition molecules acting as intracellular, membrane-bound receptors and ligands. One possible component of such a recognition site on the plasma membrane is a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 51,000 (51K) that has been isolated from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. This protein binds strongly to chromaffin granules, the secretory vesicles of these cells. To determine the function of this membrane-anchored chromaffin granule-binding protein in exocytosis, we tested the effect of intracellularly injected antibodies on secretion. Here we show, by two independent techniques in two different cell types, that antibodies against this protein inhibit exocytosis. In rat pheochromocytoma cell cultures, monospecific antibodies, applied by erythrocyte ghost fusion, impair the release of 3H-noradrenaline. The same antibodies, introduced into individual chromaffin cells through a patch pipette, block exocytosis, as revealed by the measurement of membrane capacitance. These results demonstrate the functional involvement in exocytosis of a plasma membrane protein with high affinity for secretory vesicles.\r"

Only after these larger considerations have been addressed can the benefits of a generalist-oriented system be anticipated. Even then, the gains expected to accrue from a greater number of generalists might prove illusory.\r"

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report on the Responsible Conduct of Research suggests measures for improving the research environment, by a combination of more explicit definition of standards of acceptable research practices, appointment of individuals to promote research standards and to respond to charges or complaints, improvement of supervision of research trainee, teaching of research ethics as well as technical skills, and reduction of the pressure to publish. The National Institutes of Health was asked to ensure that research institutions take such actions by requiring assurances as a condition of research funding. This essay discusses the recommendations and implications of the IOM report.\r"

One-fourth of the program is ambulatory medicine and includes training in a clinic for children and adults. Patient demographics are maintained for each resident, and an ambulatory-medicine-focused curriculum consisting of weekly conferences and self-directed independent study is used. The program is routinely evaluated and is highly rated by patients and residents. Factors critical to its success include emphasizing goals and experiences in outpatient versus inpatient care, developing an ambulatory practice to help support resident salaries, adequately preparing residents to take the board examinations in both disciplines, and providing a comprehensive primary care curriculum.\r"

Most faculty held \"clinical\" appointments, meaning that they pursued largely non-academic careers. Full-time academic appointees worked more than 20 percent more hours annually than did their \"clinical\" counterparts, and average hours for men exceeded those for women. As many as two-thirds of the full-time faculty were also engaged in sufficient clinical practice activity to be classified as full-time practicing physicians by a definition adopted by a provincial Joint Medical Manpower Committee.\r"

For many, college had failed to meet their perceived need, as physicians, for skill in dealing with people, but had provided skills in the form of basic science knowledge and willingness to be different that exceeded the demands of their careers. They wished that in college they had taken more courses in the humanities--especially art, history, music, and English literature--and less chemistry, mathematics, physics, and biology. Would-be physicians should be encouraged to take full advantage of the humanizing opportunities of a liberal arts education with confidence that it will contribute to their future professional and personal lives.\r"

The entering students had specific, detailed expectations about numerous aspects, many of which were not confirmed by their subsequent experience. The same students were reminded, one year later, of their unfulfilled expectations about the first year and were asked to describe any effects these expectations had had on class emotional climate and morale. They recalled both serious disappointments and pleasant surprises but no general change of class morale. A serendipitous finding was the profound indifference of the second-year students to their first-year emotional responses. Our results challenge the general practice of basing curriculum renewal programs on cross-sectional student surveys with no consideration of baseline expectations, and of relying on students to initiate improvements in educational programs.\r"

The responses of the primary care and subspecialty-oriented groups were the most disparate, whereas the students who were uncertain about residency plans shifted on several items from an alignment with the specialty group toward an alignment with the primary care group. This study shows that experience in a family medicine clerkship may be associated with changes in attitudes that represent development of a more informed image of primary care.\r"

Each of the eight cases investigated by each group included a primary problem with various numbers of secondary problems. Three successive time periods, called interludes, were provided in which each student had three minutes to list all the hypotheses he or she was actively considering concerning the diagnosis of the patient's problem. Each interlude was scheduled at a progressively more complete point in the student's knowledge of the case. The results supported the assertion that was tested.\r"

  ".W": "An age associated decline in joint mobility during the early and middle adult years is well documented, however, little information exists on the progress of this aspect of joint function during old age. Active and passive ranges of 10 lower limb joint motions were measured in 80 healthy, active men and women aged from 70 years, to examine the relationship between the capacity for joint movement and age, gender, and type of motion. Joint mobility declined consistently as age increased, with women generally having greater movement capability than their male peers. The predominant trend was for a more rapid reduction in mobility during the ninth decade. Passive ranges were larger than those produced actively, and the pattern of change in both measurement modes was parallel over the age range. It is hypothesized that the consistent decline in mobility indicates the importance of biological aging of articular structures as a primary cause of increasing resistance to movement, while environmental causes, such as changing activity status, are suggested by the variation in the magnitude and patterns of change over the age range.\r"

The Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) briefly assesses cognition in the ability areas of language, constructions, memory, calculation and reasoning. The NCSE, as well as the commonly used Mini-Mental State Examination and Albert's Test, were administered to 38 stroke patients before inpatient rehabilitation to determine the extent to which they predict rehabilitation outcome. Rehabilitation outcome was measured as the difference between initial and discharge Barthel Index score. The NCSE was shown to be a more sensitive indicator of impairment than the Mini-Mental State Examination and Albert's Test, especially in subsections of orientation and memory (X2 = 8.690, df = 1, P less than 0.005; X2 = 13.348, df = 1, P less than 0.001, respectively). Stepwise multiple regression revealed that attention, calculations and judgement were in association the best predictors of improvement in the Barthel Index scores. Therefore, the NCSE provides both a rapid and sensitive measure of cognitive function and it appears to predict functional status change as a result of inpatient stroke rehabilitation.\r"

Isometric contractile properties and endplate ultrastructure were measured 11 days postcrush. No significant differences were observed in tension characteristics between the exercised and nonexercised muscles on day 11. However, the postsynaptic area of endplates for exercised muscles were closer in size to controls than those for the nonexercised ones. In addition, the endplates from the exercised muscles exhibited increased numbers of axonal sprouts and terminals than nonexercised muscles. These results demonstrate that denervated muscles exercised 4 days before reinnervation can preserve the structure of the endplate as well as enhance reinnervation and sprouting at these endplates after 11 days of denervation.\r"

Fifteen demonstrated radiographic evidence of cervical degenerative disc disease and in an additional four, electromyographic evidence of cervical root compromise was present. Multiple precipitating factors were identified in Monday's headache including the predisposing presence of unrecognized impairment of visual acuity in 4 and cervical radiculopathy in 16. Mechanically, prolonged postural cervical hyperextension frequently combined with repetitive head rotation appeared to trigger the discomfort complaints. Undue elevation of the CRT screen, prolonged copying of laterally displaced hard copy, the wearing of bifocals, as well as seating either excessively soft or with a tendency to pitch the operator forward were identified as additional aggravating factors.\r"

Subjects ambulated using a three-point \"swing-through\" gait pattern while strain gauge data were recorded. Spring-loaded axillary crutches had 22% smaller shock waves upon initial contact and 24% smaller peak stresses (P less than 0.05). Subjects reported improved endurance and comfort with the spring-loaded crutch.

Abnormal measures were limited to the 75% of subjects (24) with clinical illness (colds) defined by symptom scores. Two days after infection, tubal function was present in only 50% of ears (48) and 20% of persons (5), middle ear underpressures of less than -50 mm H2O were measured in 50% of volunteers (12), and decreased nasal patency was observed in 54% of those with colds (13). These changes resolved 6 to 10 days after challenge. These results support a causal relationship between viral upper respiratory tract infection eustachian tube obstruction and abnormal middle ear pressure.\r"

The various published studies have concerned small series. This study sought to specify otoacoustic emission characteristics in relation to sensorineural hearing loss (148 ears of 76 subjects). The results show that the presence of otoacoustic emissions drops as a function of hearing loss and that there is a highly statistically significant correlation between otoacoustic emission threshold and hearing loss at the 1000-Hz frequency. Otoacoustic emissions are never found when hearing loss at 1000 Hz exceeds 40 dB hearing level and when the mean audiometric hearing loss (at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) exceeds 45 dB hearing level. The main practical conclusion is that otoacoustic emission presence indicates middle frequency functional integrity of the outer hair cells of Corti's organ. Absence of otoacoustic emissions is harder to interpret.\r"

Auditory brain-stem-evoked responses were measured in each animal prior to, 24 hours after, and 3 weeks after aspirin and noise exposure. The animals were killed and hair cells were counted in 200-micron segments and expressed graphically. Results showed significant differences in permanent threshold shift and hair cell loss between all noise-exposed animals and non-noise-exposed animals. There was also a significantly greater amount of hair cell loss in group 5 when compared with groups 3 or 4. The 12-day per 200 mg of aspirin per noise regimen (group 5) also proved to be fatal for 6 of 15 of these animals, and caused significant weight loss in the survivors. No weight loss or deaths were noted in any other group.\r"

The probability of growth in the first passage was significantly better for moderately and poorly differentiated tumors than for well-differentiated tumors. Also, the implantation of lymph node material resulted in a significantly better tumor take rate than material taken from a primary tumor. Transplantability was not dependent on the following characteristics: localization, T or N stage of the tumor, or the sex of the patients. Once growth was established, all variables studied had no influence on the probability of growth in the subsequent mouse passages. A relationship between tumor growth in nude mice and patient prognosis could not be found. When transplanting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in nude mice, it has to be recognized that some tumor characteristics will influence the success of tumor growth.\r"

For this reason, we studied circulating levels of selenium and zinc in relation to food intake and nutritional status in 14 patients with head and neck cancer. Six patients without cancer served as controls. The patients with cancer were in different stages of disease. They were untreated or in an initial phase of oncologic treatment. Five of these patients were severely cachectic according to weight loss and nutritional status, which included body mass index, anthropometric values, and serum albumin level. These patients also demonstrated decreased circulating levels of selenium and zinc. Plasma glutathione peroxidase (selenium-dependent enzyme) activity, however, was not significantly different when the cachectic patients with cancer were compared with controls. We found that the plasma selenium level was positively correlated to both short-term and long-term selenium intake when all 20 patients were accounted for. However, no significant correlation could be shown between plasma selenium and serum albumin levels. Although only one patient demonstrated a plasma value below the reference value, serum zinc was positively correlated to the serum albumin level. We conclude that plasma selenium concentrations are essentially related to food intake but not necessarily to weight loss. Low circulating levels of zinc are, rather, associated with the catabolic state of the patient with cancer.\r"

Three cases of mandibular fractures are presented in which a panoramic view failed to demonstrate fractures of the mandible that were obvious on plain film radiographs. Diagnosis and treatment planning should not be based on the information obtained from a single roentgenogram such as a panoramic view. The combination of the mandibular series with the panoramic view provides increased diagnostic information that should enable accurate diagnosis of fractures in all areas of the mandible.\r"

The results demonstrate that abnormal gastroesophageal reflux occurred in 23% of patients, implying that, while reflux may be responsible for globus in some patients, it is not the cause of globus sensation in the majority of individuals with this symptom. Comparing patients with globus and control subjects, there were no differences in lower esophageal sphincter pressures, esophageal body motility, or tonic upper esophageal sphincter pressures, but patients with globus exhibited higher pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter after-contraction pressures during deglutition. The physiological significance of this pharyngeal and upper esophageal dysmotility is not clear and it may be no more than a secondary phenomenon. Alternatively, it may contribute to the generation of globus, perhaps in combination with other physical and psychological triggers.\r"

The carbon dioxide laser has recently been used with varying reported success in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars. Proponents of this technique claim that the intrinsic properties of laser surgery, which slows fibroblast proliferation, may be responsible for delaying or preventing the recurrence of keloids. We report results on the effectiveness of carbon dioxide laser excision of earlobe keloids. Eighteen patients were followed up from 8 months to 2 years, or up to a recurrence. Four patients within this group with bilateral keloids provided a self-controlled sample. One ear was randomly chosen for laser excision and the other for scalpel excision. There were recurrences in both groups. There were also 17 recurrences in a group of 23 keloids excised by laser, 9 occurring between 6 and 12 months postoperatively. We failed to demonstrate a lower recurrence rate of earlobe keloids using the carbon dioxide laser and discuss some of the factors responsible for this outcome.\r"

The records were reviewed and chi 2 tests applied to identify possible effects of radiation therapy on the achievement of TE speech and on TEP-related complications. Results of a census indicate that, with the exception of radiotherapy, the two groups of patients were highly similar with respect to ultimate achievement of TE speech and to the frequency with which complications occurred, eg, stoma stenosis or leakage via TE fistula. These findings support the incorporation of TEP with the total laryngectomy procedure, even for patients for whom radiation therapy is indicated.\r"

The majority of these complications were in flaps used to replace bony defects or oropharyngeal resections. Although free flaps may appear to be more risky than traditional forms of reconstruction, they offer the surgeon a greater spectrum of reconstructive options. Limitations of the use of free flaps result only from lack of technical skills and specialized equipment.\r"

These cases exemplify Bezold's classic description in their site of origin in the mastoid process and route of spread in the neck. However, our contemporary examples differed in clinical setting, latency of onset, and bacterial cause. In four of the cases, delay in diagnosis occurred because of failure to recognize the disorder. Computed tomography has proved valuable in the anatomic diagnosis and surgical planning. Renewed familiarity with the clinical presentations and pathogenesis of this now uncommon condition may prevent delay in diagnosis and initiation of therapy.\r"

Of these clones, two have been isolated and characterized. Clone D10 is persistently and productively infected with an HIV variant. The clone F12, in spite of the presence of an integrated full-length HIV provirus, does not release virus particles in the medium. D10 and F12 clones substantially differ in terms of protein pattern; that is, D10 is super-imposable to infected HUT-78 cells, whereas F12 exhibits a decreased uncleaved p55 gag precursor and the presence of uncleaved gp160 and of a unique p19, although they do not show qualitative or quantitative differences in viral RNA synthesis. Restriction patterns of F12 proviral DNA do not show major genomic deletions. These results indicate that F12 clone cells carry an HIV genome with minor mutations that probably affect the correct production of viral proteins at a posttranscriptional level. In addition, the F12 clone is resistant to high-multiplicity superinfection with HIV-1 or HIV-2.\r"

  ".U": "89352107\r", 
  ".W": "A virus pool isolated from lymphoid tissue of a macaque (PBj) infected for 14 months with SIV/SMM was found to be associated with acute disease and death. Six of six pig-tailed macaques, one of three rhesus macaques, and three of four SIV/SMM-seronegative mangabeys developed acute disease within 5 days and died from 7 to 13 days postinoculation; however, neither of two SIV/SMM-infected mangabeys died or developed disease. The virus associated with acute disease and death was shown by electron microscopy to be a lentivirus and was serologically indistinguishable from SIV/SMM by immunofluorescence and radioimmunoprecipitation assays. A biologic clone generated from lymphoid tissue of an animal that died 7 days after inoculation of the lethal pool resulted in death within 8 days of three of three pig-tailed macaques. Comparison of the lethal virus, designated SIV/SMM(PBj14), with the parent virus, SIV/SMM-9 (the isolate with which macaque PBj was originally inoculated), showed that although the kinetics of replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from pig-tailed macaques and mangabey monkeys were similar, SIV/SMM(PBj14) replicated more efficiently than SIV/SMM-9 in human PBMC and also replicated in chimpanzee PBMC whereas SIV/SMM and other SIV isolates did not. In addition, the variant was shown to replicate efficiently in some established cell lines whereas replication of SIV/SMM-9 in cell lines could be demonstrated only occasionally. That parental SIV/SMM-9, but not SIV/SMM(PBj14), was neutralized by serum from macaque PBj suggests that the variant may have been generated by immune selection. Comparison of sequential virus isolates from macaque PBj for host range and the ability to be neutralized and of sequential serum samples for neutralization activity indicated that changes in biologic properties were detected in virus isolates and serum obtained at 6 months after infection and later. Normal macaque PBMC infected in vitro with SIV/SMM(PBj14), but not with SIV/SMM-9 or other virus pools from PBj, formed syncytia with Sup-T1 cells, whereas all isolates formed syncytia with MOLT-4 clone 8 cells. These data suggest that, relative to SIV/SMM-9, SIV/SMM(PBj14) acquired multiple mutations, at least one (or more) of which is in the gene coding for the envelope glycoprotein. Continued analysis of this series of SIV/SMM isolates with diverse properties may lead to the identification of specific regions of the viral genome that influence defined biologic properties. Furthermore, the availability of a strain of SIV that induces rapid onset of disease and death may facilitate screening of drugs for antiviral activity against lentiviruses.\r"

  ".W": "Ischaemic heart disease is commoner among immigrants from the Indian subcontinent than among Europeans in the United Kingdom. The excess cannot be accounted for by differences in smoking, blood pressure, or lipid concentrations. There is, however, an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Asian population. Separate estimates of the relative risk of acute myocardial infarction associated with diabetes from parallel case-control studies were made to compare the importance of diabetes as a risk factor in the two ethnic groups. For Asians the relative risk was 3.3 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 5.8) and for Europeans 1.3 (1.0 to 1.7). Calculations of population attributable risk indicated that clinical diabetes mellitus accounts for 21% of the incidence of myocardial infarction in Asians but only 3% of the incidence in Europeans. Diabetes mellitus is of sufficient quantitative importance as a risk factor to account for the whole of the observed excess of deaths from ischaemic heart disease among Asians in the United Kingdom.\r"

The ultrasound results were compared with changes in arterial oxygen tension and the overall clinical response to prostaglandin E1 seen during the same period in 24 of the 25 patients in whom the degree of ductal narrowing could be determined with the ultrasound method. At the time of the study, the ductus was widely patent or slightly narrowed in 12 patients and was closed in two patients. These patients did not respond to prostaglandin E1. There was prominent localised narrowing of the ductus in seven patients and generalised narrowing in three. After the infusion of prostaglandin E1 there was no ductal narrowing in these patients, except for one patient who had slight residual localised narrowing. There was also a considerable change in the ductal flow profiles in each patient. In these 10 patients infusion of prostaglandin E1 resulted in an increase in arterial oxygen tension, clinical improvement, or both. The present study indicates that prostaglandin E1 is effective in patients with prominent narrowing of the ductus but is not in patients in whom the ductus is widely patent or closed. Cross sectional echocardiography combined with Doppler echocardiography was useful for predicting the responsiveness of the ductus arteriosus to the infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous balloon dilatation of the aortic valve was attempted in 25 consecutive patients with stenosis. The aortic valve diameters were normal for age. The balloon catheters were placed retrogradely, and their diameters were within 1-2 mm of the valve diameter and 3 (13 patients) or 6 cm (recent 12 patients) long. After dilatation the pressure gradients across the aortic valve were reduced significantly and the valve areas, measured in 10 patients, increased. Aortic regurgitation was detected in six patients before (grade I) the procedure and in 15 patients (6 grade I, 6 grade II, 3 grade III) after the procedure. In one patient the aortic valve could not be crossed and in three there was no reduction in the pressure drop. Nine patients have a sustained reduction in Doppler assessed gradients. There were vascular complications in 12 and these required surgical intervention in three patients. Balloon dilatation seems to be an effective short term palliative procedure in patients with congenital stenosis of the aortic valve.\r"

Images were acquired in coronal and transverse planes to localised protruding lesions and then chemical shift imaging was performed by techniques described by Dixon and by Hinks. These techniques produce images in which signal strength is proportional to lipid content. The signal was expressed as a percentage of that from extravascular fat. The total lipid content and its distribution within the plaques were noted. After imaging, the postmortem specimens were examined histologically and the lipid content of the plaque was assessed on a semiquantitative scale. The distribution of lipid within the plaque and between intima and media was also noted. The findings of chemical shift imaging agreed well with histological examination both for total lipid content and for distribution within each plaque. Chemical shift imaging also provided an assessment of the lipid content of the plaques measured in living patients, but validation was more difficult. The usefulness of the technique in routine clinical practice remains to be established.\r"
