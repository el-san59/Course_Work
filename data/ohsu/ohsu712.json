  ".W": "Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor in which aggressive growth produces recurrence in approximately 50% of appropriately treated cases and metastases along the neuraxis in 30%. To date, no studies exist concerning the production of autocrine growth factors by this brain tumor type. Malignant brain tumors in adults often produce platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A medulloblastoma cell line, TE-671, has been used for many years in pediatric neuro-oncologic studies. We assayed this medulloblastoma cell line for the production of PDGF. PDGF is produced by medulloblastoma cells grown in monolayer tissue culture and stimulates PDGF-sensitive 3T3 fibroblasts to incorporate tritiated thymidine in a dose-dependent fashion. This biologic activity is blocked by PDGF antibodies in a dose-dependent relationship. We postulate that PDGF produced by medulloblastoma cells plays a role in the growth of this tumor by stimulating mitogenic activity.\r"

She had personality changes, speech and gait disturbances, diffuse rigidity, dementia, and a well-documented family history of Huntington disease. Electroencephalography revealed bilateral epileptic foci; however, she had no seizures. Positron emission tomography using [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose with an improved method for quantification of glucose metabolism in anatomically defined regions of interest demonstrated marked hypometabolism in the caudate nuclei and putamen, as is observed in adults with the disease. Glucose metabolism was also reduced in the posterior nuclei of the thalamus. Adults with Huntington disease have consistently demonstrated normal or increased rates of thalamic glucose metabolism. The findings suggest that brain metabolic alterations of Huntington disease in children differ from those in adults which is consistent with the postmortem pathologic differences previously recognized.\r"

The functional handicaps were correlated to the degree of periventricular hyperintensity observed on magnetic resonance imaging when periventricular hyperintensity was divided into 4 grades; therefore, the extent of periventricular hyperintensity observed on magnetic resonance imaging has been proved to be of value in the clinical assessment of low-birth weight infants and children and may contribute to the prediction of later functional deficits.\r"

(In this study, teaching hospitals were all hospitals with any reported affiliation with a medical school. About half of the hospitals studied had a major commitment to teaching, with several residency programs and a substantial number of residents in each program.) For each year studied (1981 - 1987), the teaching hospital CEOs experienced less turnover than did nonteaching hospital CEOs. While the turnover of CEOs from nonteaching hospitals showed a linear increase each year, culminating at 25.2% in 1987, the turnover of CEOs from teaching hospitals showed a more erratic pattern, resulting in 18.7% that year. A group of hospitals was identified that accounted for a large proportion of all recent CEO turnover. For example, 16% of the teaching hospitals experienced two or more CEO turnovers between 1981 and 1986. But these \"higher-turnover\" hospitals accounted for almost half of all teaching hospital turnovers. The higher-turnover hospitals were disproportionately found among non-federal government hospitals, in regions outside the Midwest, and in large cities; these hospitals also experienced higher costs per patient day and lower operating margins than did the lower-turnover hospitals. The research suggests that turnover may be accounted for, in part, by the comparative performance of a hospital relative to other hospitals of its type. Thus, whether hospitals experience stable, increasing, or declining operating margins, the higher-turnover hospitals typically under-perform relative to other hospitals.\r"

The survey was conducted in 1986-87 via a questionnaire mailed to 2,030 individuals, including freshmen, juniors, interns, residents, and newly practicing generalists; 80.3% responded. Compared with the views attributed to the faculty, the medical trainees gave more importance to basic diagnostic and therapeutic skills such as the medical history, the physical examination, and the treatment of common diseases. They also valued to a greater extent non-biological dimensions of clinical competence, such as communication with patients, patient education, the social context of disease, and the multidisciplinary nature of patient care, while they ascribed less importance to medical technology and rare diseases. The study raises the question of the relevance of medical education to medical practice by suggesting that those who are preparing themselves to become doctors may not be receiving the training they wish to receive.\r"

The preceptor training program consists of a full-day faculty development workshop for prospective community preceptors and periodic follow-up activities designed to reinforce workshop goals. Five workshops have been held from 1984 to 1987 and have provided a group of trained faculty preceptors for the ACR. The authors reviewed the methods and results of the workshops; self-ratings by participants demonstrated a significant gain in teaching skills and knowledge. Students' ratings of both the ACR course and the teaching by preceptors have been high and compare favorably with ratings of other preceptors and clinical rotations. There has been a 97% retention rate of the workshop-trained preceptors as active teachers in the ACR course, which suggests that the preceptors are satisfied with their role.\r"

After defining an \"innovative curriculum,\" the participants identified seven characteristics of \"important evaluation studies,\" particularly endorsing studies that compare curricula as whole entities. The participants then identified 26 areas where differences between graduates of innovative and traditional curricula might be expected, and five equally important areas where differences are not expected. Distinctive outcomes of innovative curricula were anticipated in areas such as interpersonal skills, continuing learning, and professional satisfaction. Overall, these recommendations are offered to stimulate creative evaluations of the growing number of innovative programs in medical education.\r"

Conflicting opinions about the indications, patient selection, timing, and technique of surgery are supported by various published series of cases. The records of 64 consecutive tympanoplasty procedures performed at the Boston (Mass) Children's Hospital over a recent 6-year period were reviewed. The study was limited to cases of repair of uncomplicated perforation of pars tensa that did not require ossiculoplasty or mastoidectomy. Surgery was successful in 73% of cases. A number of factors that are postulated to affect the outcome of surgery have been analyzed to assess their utility in selecting successful surgical candidates. Only patient age at the time of surgery was found to have statistical significance. We conclude that tympanoplasty for repair of perforation is warranted for children 8 years of age and older.\r"

Differences in fracture characteristics, associated injuries, and treatment modalities were correlated to the maturational changes in the pediatric facial skeleton. The fracture site tended to shift from the upper to the lower aspect of the face with increasing age of the patient. Associated injuries were frequent, especially cranial injuries, and temporal bone fractures were notably more common in the youngest age group. Conservative treatment was found to be successful, particularly in the youngest age group, because of the unique remodeling potential of the pediatric facial skeleton.\r"

All of the patients had bilateral true vocal cord paralysis with absent laryngeal sensitivity that was documented at endoscopy. As many as 50% of survivors of severe Reye's syndrome have breathy voices or aphonia. It is suggested that some of these children may have vocal cord dysfunction that is not the result of intubation, and are at risk for aspiration and its dangerous sequelae. A vagal nuclear injury is theorized to explain the sensory motor dysfunction of the larynx in these children.\r"

Polymyxin B, an antibiotic frequently used in ototopical preparations, has been shown to be ototoxic in experimental studies. To investigate the effect of fosfomycin on polymyxin B ototoxicity, topical administration of the two agents into the middle ear cavity was performed. Two groups of chinchillas were used. One group received applications of polymyxin B alone, and the second group received polymyxin B combined with fosfomycin. It was found that application of polymyxin B produces severe damage to the cochlea. However, when polymyxin B was given in combination with fosfomycin, cochlear damage was dramatically reduced. It is likely that in clinical use, a combination of polymyxin B and fosfomycin would demonstrate reduced risk of ototoxicity.\r"

Moreover, histologic observations of the round window membrane following bacterial inoculation further support the evidence of functional changes in round window membrane permeability. These findings indicate that the round window membrane in resolved stages of purulent otitis media plays a protective role in preventing the penetration of harmful substances into the inner ear.\r"

The difference in the level of action potentials of the cricothyroid muscle between during phonation and during respiration was used for setting the threshold so as to differentiate phonation from respiration. Nearly synchronous movement of the two vocal cords thereby attained during phonation greatly improved the voice quality that was hoarse without the paced stimulation.\r"

Narrowing of mastoid air cells, the internal auditory meati, and eustachian tubes was present, the latter associated with chronic otitis media. The bone deposition in the ossicles contributed to the conductive hearing loss, which was a prominent feature in this patient's otologic findings.

The determinants of early mortality were studied by univariate Kaplan-Meier estimates compared by the log rank test and Cox proportional hazards multiple regression analysis. Significant univariate predictors of early mortality were QRS axis above +90 degrees, intraventricular conduction delay (QRS duration greater than 0.12 s), duration of symptoms before presentation, New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV, presence of embolic episodes, right atrial mean pressures greater than 20 mm Hg, right ventricular end diastolic pressure greater than 20 mm Hg, and aortic oxygen saturation less than 85%. The significant multivariate predictors of mortality were cyanosis, New York Heart Association functional class at first presentation, and right atrial mean pressure greater than 20 mm Hg.

Global indices of ventricular function were depressed after Mustard repair and wall motion abnormalities were common. The presence of wall motion abnormalities in this group was associated with a reduction in ejection fraction and ventricular filling rates. In four of five patients in whom an appropriate preoperative angiogram was available a similar pattern of wall motion was seen before the Mustard operation, suggesting that preoperative events may be important in determining eventual outcome.\r"

Left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic dimensions were increased above the normal 95% confidence interval in four patients, three of whom showed a depressed shortening fraction. Mitral regurgitation was present in six patients; this was severe enough to need valve replacement in two. Mean echo amplitude in both the septum and the posterior wall was significantly increased above normal by a mean (SD) of 4.87 (2.57) dB, suggesting the presence of myocardial fibrosis. There was no evidence of subendocardial involvement as there is in other hypereosinophilic syndromes. Mitral regurgitation is common in the Churg-Strauss syndrome. This cannot be ascribed to involvement of the cusps or chordae and it occurs even when ventricular function is well preserved. It is suggested that mitral regurgitation is caused by diffuse myocardial fibrosis.\r"

Once the valve was replaced, the haemolysis subsided. Fulminant haemolysis after mitral valve replacement is rare. When it does occur, a paraprosthetic leak should be suspected.

  ".W": "At echocardiography a dysmorphic neonate was found to have a hypoplastic mitral valve, left ventricle, and ascending aorta with interruption of the aortic arch between the left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries--the left subclavian artery arose from a normal sized left descending aorta. Cardiac catheterisation and subsequent necropsy confirmed this arrangement but also showed a tortuous right retro-oesophageal aortic arch. This arch was severely hypoplastic distal to the right subclavian artery. These cardiovascular anomalies occurred in the child of a family in which other members showed the velo-cardio-facial syndrome, a condition known to be associated with right aortic arch. This aortic arch arrangement may be impossible to distinguish from simple aortic interruption by echocardiography alone.\r"

  ".W": "This is the fifth survey of staffing (consultants and senior registrars) in cardiology in the United Kingdom. Data from previous years--including the fourth survey (1986) that was not published separately--are used to show the trends over the past decade. In 1988 there were less than six cardiologists per million population. The United Kingdom, with Ireland, has fewer cardiologists than all other European countries with reliable figures. The ratio for Europe as a whole is approximately 45 per million population; the recommended figure for the United States of America is 60 per million. The distribution of cardiologists in England and Wales is still very uneven. Seven million people--nearly 15% of the population--have no immediate access to special expertise in cardiology. Women are particularly poorly represented in the specialty. This survey indicates that the crisis in staffing for cardiology continues. It will worsen as the possibilities grow for effective management of heart disease and as needs increase with the greater average age of the population. Resolution of this crisis should be a major priority in policies aimed at countering the ravages of heart disease.\r"

The only significant effect of extradural diamorphine was a decrease in the glucose response to surgery. Somatostatin 3 mg by the extradural route caused a significant increase in the concentration of circulating somatostatin which resulted in a significant decrease in plasma growth hormone and insulin after 60 min of surgery, together with an increase in plasma glycerol concentration. Patients in the diamorphine group required significantly less i.v. analgesia in the postoperative period than the other two groups.

Infusion requirements for the maintenance of a stable 90-99% muscle twitch depression were determined in 28 children anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and 1% halothane (inspired) in oxygen or nitrous oxide in oxygen and opioid. Neuromuscular block was assessed by monitoring the force of contraction of the adductor of the thumb during train-of-four (TOF) stimulation at 0.1 Hz. Infusion rate and twitch depression were analysed from 15 to 75 min and from 75 to 135 min after the start of the infusion. In the first period of evaluation, the mean infusion requirement was 10.4 (SEM 0.92) micrograms kg-1 min-1 during the halothane anaesthesia and 13 (1.4) micrograms kg-1 min-1 during the opiod anaesthesia (P less than 0.05). This difference was present also during the second 60-min period. There was no significant correlation between infusion rates required to maintain greater than 90% depression of the first twitch (T1) of the TOF and plasma cholinesterase concentrations. Regardless of the anaesthetic regimen, children recovered rapidly after discontinuing the infusion. The recovery index (25-75% recovery of T1) for all patients was 5.4 (0.57) min with no significant differences between the groups.\r"

Concentrations of laudanosine in CSF and plasma increased during the infusion period, and after 125-140 min reached means of 202.5 ng ml-1 and 1448.7 ng ml-1, respectively. The highest recorded concentration of laudanosine in CSF was 570 ng ml-1, in one of two CSF samples found to contain atracurium. After operation, two patients had fits, but these were not thought to be related to laudanosine. It is concluded that during infusion of atracurium, laudanosine accumulates in both plasma and CSF.\r"

In all other age groups the ADQ proved to be a simple monitor of the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. Neurological deficit occurred only if the ADQ was abnormal during hypotension for a period exceeding 7 min. ADQ evaluation of cerebral function was limited by events which produced artificially normal ADQ readings such as low amplitude EEG activity and the described isoflurane effect that was demonstrated to occur in some cardiac patients. The results obtained by the ADQ were comparable to those obtained by compressed spectral array and the ADQ was easier to use and interpret.\r"

Ketamine 20-200 mumol litre-1 predominantly increased excitability by a postsynaptic action: it enhanced the amplitude of the antidromic (field) potential response in extracellular recordings; in intracellular studies depolarized or did not change the resting membrane potential; increased intrinsic excitability (assessed by direct stimulation); and reduced accommodation properties of CA1 neurones. Methohexitone 10-100 mumol litre-1 did not affect the amplitude of the antidromic field potential responses, tended to hyperpolarize and reduce the intrinsic excitability, but did not alter accommodation properties. At these concentrations these agents either did not affect or, in the case of ketamine, enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission on to the CA1 pyramidal neurones. Methohexitone 50 and 100 mumol litre-1 also induced a large, slow (several seconds) after depolarization which followed the conventional orthodromic response and may lead to action potential discharge. It is clear that these agents have multiple actions on CA1 pyramidal neurones in vitro and that ketamine and methohexitone in vitro influence excitability by different mechanisms.\r"

At near clinical concentrations (approximately 2.5%) the anaesthetics slightly depressed antidromic field potential responses. At the same concentrations the anaesthetics also blocked accommodation reversibly and reduced the after hyperpolarization of CA1 neurones. No significant changes in the threshold potential were observed, although the resting membrane potential was often increased in the presence of the anaesthetics. The action of enflurane was not blocked by propranolol 20 mumol litre-1 and enflurane had no obvious effect on the duration of Ca2+ spikes of CA1 neurones. It is concluded that the anaesthetics may have a direct effect on membrane K+ channels such as the Ca2+-activated K+ conductance and that the block of accommodation is unlikely to account for the proconvulsant action of enflurane.\r"

Invasive ACP--manual or electrical at 10 Hz--applied for 5 min at the time of administration of the premedication markedly reduced the incidence of vomiting and nausea in the first 6 h after operation, compared with untreated controls. This did not occur with stimulation of a \"dummy\" ACP point outside the recognized ACP meridians. Non-invasive methods (stimulation via a conducting stud or by pressure) were equally as effective as invasive ACP during the early postoperative period. However, both these non-invasive approaches were less effective than invasive ACP in the 1-6 h postoperative period, although each was as effective as two standard antiemetics (cyclizine 50 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg). In view of the total absence of any side effects in more than 500 ACP procedures, the clinical applications of this finding are worthy of further study.\r"

Six patients had anterior and 14 had posterior chamber implants. The mean age of the whole group at the time of surgery was 5.9 years (range 0.3 to 15.1 years), while the mean period of follow-up was 2.4 years (range 0.8 to 5.9 years). Postoperatively 10 patients developed a transient fibrinous uveitis, four required lens repositioning, one needed lens removal, and eight required posterior capsulotomy. Complications warranting secondary surgical procedures occurred predominantly in eyes with posterior chamber implants. Co-operation with conventional amblyopia treatment was satisfactory in eight out of 16 patients. Postoperatively nine out of 18 patients had peripheral fusion, four patients regained visual acuities of better than 6/9, and visual acuity did not improve beyond 3/60 in six cases. In 19 eyes the optical pathway to the retina is clear and the implants are stable with no evidence of persisting inflammation. Contact lenses remain the initial treatment of choice in infancy, but modern intraocular lenses are well tolerated and have a role in the visual rehabilitation of patients with contact lens and probable contact lens failures and older children with uniocular cataracts.\r"

  ".U": "90105253\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic orbital inflammatory disease (COID) is usually considered non-infectious and idiopathic. Treatment is empirical, palliative, and may not prevent disease progression. COID occurs in isolation or in association with various systemic diseases. Exophthalmos may be an important presenting sign. Vasculitis, lymphoid infiltrates, and granulomas are common. Mollicute-like organisms (MLO) parasitising and destroying vitreous leucocytes are often found to cause human chronic uveitis when an appropriate search is made. Inoculation of these MLO into mouse eyelids produced chronic uveitis and exophthalmic orbital inflammatory disease. Mollicutes are cell wall deficient bacteria. Extracellular mollicutes cause human and animal diseases characterised by lymphoid infiltrates, immunosuppression, and autoantibody production. Intracellular morphologically similar bacteria are non-cultivable pathogens termed MLO. Identification is based on direct detection in diseased cells by transmission electron microscopy. MLO are cytopathogenic and detection is aided by the alterations they produce. MLO replace the cytoplasm, destroy the organelles, and alter the nucleus. This results in cell proliferation, destruction, and dysfunction. MLO parasitise lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. This report describes orbital leucocytes parasitised by MLO in three patients with isolated COID. Rifampicin treatment of MLO disease is discussed.\r"

Tissue from 32 eyes of 17 fetuses with a gestational age from 12 to 22 weeks were investigated in order to determine the morphological changes in the cellular lining of the anterior chamber angle recess during development. The findings indicate that, although hexagonal corneal endothelial profiles extend almost to the angle apex in a few of the younger eyes examined (12-14 weeks), the lining is always perforated by a few discrete intercellular gaps (2-6 microns diameter). As development progresses it becomes clearer that the maturing meshwork is lined by uveal trabecular endothelial cells which are morphologically distinguishable from corneal endothelium. The frequency and size of the gaps between the inner uveal trabecular endothelial cells increase and are well developed by 18-20 weeks, clearly providing a route of communication between the fetal anterior chamber and the developing intercellular spaces in the primitive trabecular tissue. The implications of these observations on the 'Barkan's membrane' theory of congenital glaucoma are discussed.\r"

Children under 10 years of age accounted for 4% of the total patients presenting, but for more than 18% of those admitted and 26% of ocular penetrations. 98.3% of all injuries involved periorbital or superficial ocular structures only. The remainder involved intraocular structures. The majority of serious injuries were contusional. There was only one case of intraocular foreign body. This indicates that, while most injuries still occur in the workplace, sport and leisure activities account for the majority of serious injuries. While most injuries do not threaten sight, they do so disproportionately in children.\r"

Thirty-nine of these lesions enlarged during a five-year follow-up interval (cumulative proportion of lesions that enlarged = 26.2% by Kaplan-Meier method). Individual clinical parameters predictive of lesion enlargement (p less than 0.01) included larger size of the lesion, especially lesion thickness, presence of retinal detachment, location of the lesion's posterior margin within 2 disc diameters of the optic disc, presence of symptoms, and presence of orange pigment clumps on the lesion's surface. The best combination of these parameters for prediction of lesion enlargement, as identified by multivariate Cox regression analysis, consisted of thickness of the lesion, retinal detachment, and symptoms. The five-year incidence of lesion enlargement for patients with none of these prognostic parameters was 5.8%, while that for patients with all three unfavourable parameters simultaneously was 90.6%.\r"

The mean concentration of 8,279 micrograms/L in 56 normal adults appears to be unrelated to age or sex. Additional receptor measurements were performed on plasmas from 260 subjects with erythropoietic disorders. Decreased concentration of plasma receptors was found in patients with erythroid hypoplasia and increased numbers in those with erythroid hyperplasia. Ferrokinetic measurements of erythropoiesis were compared with numbers of receptors in 148 subjects, and a close correlation was found (r = .86). Both sets of values, measured in different conditions and expressed in relation to normal, were consistent with expected values. Receptor values were unproportionally increased only in conditions of iron deficiency. It is concluded that plasma receptors have a constant relationship to tissue receptors, and their number in most instances reflects the rate of erythropoiesis.\r"

  ".U": "90105666\r", 
  ".W": "An inhibitor of procoagulant and fibrinolytic enzymes was derived from cabbage seeds by a procedure using acetone precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The cabbage seed inhibitor was a 10-Kd monomeric protein with intrachain disulfide bonds. This preparation prevented clot formation in whole blood and blocked the ability of thrombin to induce clot formation in plasma and to induce platelet aggregation. A number of proteases were inhibited, as demonstrated by using purified enzymes in amidolytic assays. Tight-binding inhibition was observed for activated Stuart factor (factor Xa) and plasmin. Inhibition of thrombin and activated Hageman factor (factor XIIa) was observed with a molar excess of inhibitor. No inhibition was detected for activated plasma thromboplastin antecedent (factor XIa), plasma kallikrein, or C1 esterase. Reaction progress curves for trypsin indicated slow, tight-binding inhibition, with an apparent inhibition constant in the nanomolar range or less. The electrophoretic mobility of trypsin was altered by the inhibitor in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) but not in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, indicating noncovalent bonding. Only partial reversal of trypsin inhibition could be demonstrated by washing the inhibitor from enzyme immobilized on solid beads. A dot-blot technique with cabbage seed inhibitor was capable of detecting 10 ng nitrocellulose-bound trypsin. The dot-blot technique also appeared capable of detecting plasmin. These findings demonstrated the potential utility of this inhibitor as a probe for detection of tightly bound proteases. In summary, cabbage seed extracts contain an inhibitor with activity toward a broad range of proteases important to hemostasis. To our knowledge, this agent represents the first inhibitor isolated from a plant source that inhibits thrombin.\r"

  ".W": "Thiazole orange (TO), a fluorescent dye originally synthesized for reticulocyte analysis, is characterized by a large fluorescence enhancement and high quantum yield on binding to nucleic acids, particularly RNA. In addition, the dye readily permeates live cell membranes. We applied TO staining, followed by fluorescence-activated flow cytometric analysis, to platelets in whole blood samples from hematologically normal subjects and patients with various quantitative platelet disorders. The percentage of TO-positive platelets in 50 control subjects was 8.6 +/- 2.8% (mean +/- SD) ranging from 2.8% to 15.8%. In 21 thrombocytopenic patients whose bone marrow contained normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes, the percentage of fluorescently labeled platelets was significantly elevated (P less than .0001) to 26.9 +/- 10.9% (range, 13.3% to 57.1%). In contrast, the proportion of positively stained platelets in 23 patients with thrombocytopenia due to impaired platelet production (various conditions with reduced marrow megakaryocytes) did not significantly differ from the controls, whereas the absolute counts of TO-positive platelets were significantly lowered (P less than .0001). Differences in the distributions of the percentage values as well as of the absolute counts for TO-positive platelets between the two patient groups were again highly significant (P less than .0001). Both the sensitivity and the specificity of this method in distinguishing between these categories of thrombocytopenia were greater than or equal to 95%. We conclude that flow cytometric analysis of platelets after staining with TO is a sensitive and specific test that rapidly provides information on the thrombopoietic activity in thrombocytopenic disorders. Our data further suggest that increased amounts of residual RNA characterize platelets released under conditions of \"stress thrombopoiesis.\"\r"

Human alveolar macrophages and alveolar fluids were obtained 18 hours after healthy male adults were exposed, for 2 hours during intermittent exercise, to either air or air with 0.4 ppm ozone, added as a model toxic respiratory agent. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for both tissue factor and factor VII were demonstrated in macrophages isolated after subjects were exposed to unpolluted control air. With the same subjects examined after breathing ozone, the following changes were observed: tissue factor mRNA concentration in macrophages increased 2.6 +/- 0.47-fold. Factor VII mRNA concentration was reduced 0.64 +/- 0.24-fold. Total numbers of macrophages recovered did not change significantly. Ratios of nuclear:cytoplasmic areas of cytocentrifuged macrophages were augmented by 24.8% +/- 3%, giving morphometric evidence that immature cell forms increased in the population. In the lavage, tissue factor activity was increased 2.1 +/- 0.3-fold, while amounts of lipid phosphorous, which estimate total membrane lipids, and estimated volumes of alveolar fluid were not significantly changed. Factor VII activity and fibrinopeptide A levels in lavage were increased approximately twofold. These results using rapidly isolated, noncultured cells indicate that tissue factor and factor VII mRNA are synthesized in the alveolar macrophage population in vivo. In addition, evidence was found that as a result of breathing ozone, a shift in alveolar macrophage maturity occurred in association with tissue factor mRNA, tissue factor activity, and factor VII activity increases, and with formation of fibrinopeptide A in alveolar fluids.\r"

  ".U": "90105669\r", 
  ".W": "Flow cytometry was used to determine whether activated platelets and platelet-derived microparticles can be detected directly in whole blood after a hemostatic insult. Two different in vivo models of platelet activation were examined: (1) a standardized bleeding time, and (2) cardiopulmonary bypass. Platelets and microplatelets were identified with a biotinylated anti-glycoprotein (GP)lb antibody and a fluorophore, phycoerythrin-streptavidin. Microparticles were distinguished from platelets by light scatter. Activated platelets were detected with three fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs): (1) PAC1, which binds to the activated form of GPIIb-IIIa; (2) 9F9, a newly developed antibody that is specific for fibrinogen bound to the surface of activated platelets; and (3) S12, which binds to an alpha-granule membrane protein expressed on the platelet surface after granule secretion. In nine normal subjects, bleeding times ranged from 4.5 to 7.5 minutes. Over this time, there was a progressive increase in the amount of PAC1, 9F9, and S12 bound to platelets in blood emerging from the bleeding time wound. With all three antibodies, platelet activation was apparent as early as 30 seconds after the incision (P less than .03). Activation was accompanied by a progressive decrease in the concentration of platelets in blood from the wound, while the concentration of microparticles increased slightly. In nine patients undergoing open heart surgery, 1 hour of cardiopulmonary bypass caused a 2.2-fold increase in the relative proportion of microparticles in circulating blood (P less than .001). Moreover, bypass caused platelet activation as evidenced by a mean two- to threefold increase in PAC1 binding to platelets. Although this increase was significant (P less than .02), PAC1 binding exceeded the normal range for unstimulated control platelets in only 5 of 9 patients, and 9F9 and S12 binding exceeded the normal range in only two patients. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that it is now feasible using flow cytometry to evaluate the extent of platelet activation and the presence of platelet-derived microparticles in the circulation of humans.\r"

FcRIII was not found in specific or azurophilic granules as shown by immunogold double-labeling experiments, visualizing both FcRIII and either lactoferrin (a marker of specific granules) or myeloperoxidase (a marker for azurophilic granules). Because the occurrence of FcRIII in the Golgi complex suggested that biosynthesis of this receptor occurs in these cells, metabolic labeling experiments were performed. Immunoprecipitation of FcRIII from NP-40 lysates of cells labeled with 35S-methionine showed a diffuse 50- to 70-Kd band corresponding with the band noted after immunoprecipitation of FcRIII from surface iodinated cells. These findings show that de novo synthesis of FcRIII occurs in neutrophils and suggest that at least some of the small vesicles containing FcRIII derive from the Golgi complex and thus are involved in transport of newly synthesized FcRIII to the plasma membrane.\r"

For this study, exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2)-independent, antigen-specific, CD4 positive, human T-cell clones were developed by cyclic restimulation with soluble tetanus toxoid antigen. In the presence of soluble antigen and antigen-presenting cells (APC), T-cell clones proliferated and secreted IL-2. Purified gp120 suppressed the proliferative responses of the T-cell clones with concomitant suppression of IL-2 secretion; proliferative responses of CD8+ T cells preincubated with gp120 were not inhibited. A short pulse of 20 minutes with gp120 was sufficient to inhibit the proliferative response of the T-cell clones. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb)-driven proliferation of the T-cell clones was also suppressed by gp120, but responses elicited by mitogens, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus calcium ionophore, ionomycin, anti-CD2 MoAbs, and a combination of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 MoAb driven responses remained unaffected. Investigation of signal transduction events showed that antigen-driven early activation signals via translocation of protein kinase C (PKC), increase in intracellular inositol phosphates, and increase in intracellular calcium were suppressed in gp120 pretreated, tetanus toxoid antigen-stimulated T-cell clones. One mechanism of immune suppression by gp120 may involve interference with the initiation of signal transduction through the T-cell receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported that low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF) plus recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) synergistically induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity from the bone marrow (BM) cells of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The kinetics of cell growth, antigenic phenotype, and lytic activity of the generated effector cells were further analyzed in this study. BM cells from ALL patients with active disease and in complete remission (CR) were cultured with a combination of LMW-BCGF and rIL-2. Monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3 and anti-Leu 19) and immunomagnetic beads were used to separate LAK cells into three subsets: CD3+/Leu 19-, CD3+/Leu 19+, and CD3-/Leu 19+. Cytotoxicity assays with different subsets were performed versus K562, Raji, and autologous leukemic cells, using a 3-hour 51Cr release test. There was a significant cell expansion of 54-fold (mean value) for CD3+ cells and 15-fold for Leu 19+ cells in culture with LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2 for 7 to 14 days, whereas no cell expansion was observed in culture with rIL-2 alone. Although NK activity (K562) was generated from leukemic BM cells in culture with rIL-2 alone, it is only about one third of that generated in culture with rIL-2 plus LMW-BCGF. Analysis of lytic activity of cells generated in the latter cultures demonstrated that CD3-/Leu 19+ cells expressed highest lytic activity against NK-sensitive K562 cells as well as against NK-resistant Raji cells. CD3+/Leu 19+ cells showed median cytotoxicity, and CD3+Leu 19- cells mediated only minimal cytotoxic activity. Also, lytic activity of CD3-/Leu 19+ cells against autologous leukemic blasts was noted in patients with active disease. Our results demonstrate that LAK activity generated from BM cells by LMW-BCGF and r-IL2 is mediated mainly by two types of Leu 19+ cells: CD3-/Leu 19+ NK cells and CD3-/Leu 19+ T cells. Although CD3+ T cells (both Leu 19+ and Leu 19-) mediated less antitumor cytotoxicity than CD3-/Leu 19+ cells, the former cells were the major expanding cell population in culture with LMW-BCGF and rIL-2. The new culture system may be effective in generation of cells with LAK activity for therapeutic use.\r"

Central nervous system (CNS) leukemia was present in 12.5% of the cases, a mediastinal mass in 61%, and L2 lymphoblast morphology in 32%. A relatively high proportion of cases, 26%, had normal karyotypes at presentation. Of the cases tested, membrane CD1 expression was found in 38% of cases, CD3 in 33%, CD4 in 50%, CD5 in 94%, CD8 in 55%, and CD10 in 35%. Four presenting features were found to confer an increased risk of treatment failure: age greater than or equal to 15 years, L2 lymphoblast morphology, abnormal karyotype, and membrane CD3 expression. This study illustrates the heterogeneity of presentations of childhood T-cell ALL and suggests that the relative importance of risk factors in ALL differs according to immunophenotype and treatment strategy.\r"

No significant associations were found between myeloid-associated antigen expression and the presence of known adverse prognostic features (eg, higher leukocyte count, nonwhite race, older age). Myeloid-associated antigen expression had no effect on remission induction or event-free survival for the 267 children who had been treated with the same combination of chemotherapeutic agents (P = .34). Thus, blast cell expression of myeloid-associated antigens in childhood ALL appears to lack prognostic value in the context of contemporary intensive chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils express two distinct types of receptor for the Fc region of IgG, FcRII and FcRIII, in amounts of 10,000 to 20,000 FcRII (40 Kd) and 100,000 to 200,000 FcRIII (50 to 80 Kd) per neutrophil. We showed that the FcRIII exhibits genetically determined heterogeneity, detectable by differences in electrophoretic mobility with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as well as by reaction with antibodies against the biallelic neutrophil-specific antigen system NA. FcRIII was precipitated with an FcRIII-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) from the neutrophils of 35 donors. NA1NA1 donors expressed an FcRIII with a molecular weight (mol wt) of 50 to 65 Kd, NA1NA2 donors expressed an FcRIII with a mol wt of 50 to 80 Kd, and NA2NA2 donors expressed an FcRIII with a mol wt of 65 to 80 Kd. Statistical analysis showed that the electrophoretic heterogeneity corresponds with the NA polymorphism (k = 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation with a MoAb against NA1 and a MoAb against anti-FcRIII, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), showed that NA1-FcRIII is distinct from NA2-FcRIII. Moreover, immunoprecipitation with a MoAb against NA1 yielded a protein of 50 to 65 Kd, and immunoprecipitation with human anti-NA2 sera or an MoAb against NA2 yielded a protein of 65 to 80 Kd. Preincubation of NA1NA2 neutrophils with F(ab')2 fragments of an MoAb against anti-NA1 reduced binding of IgG dimers to these cells with about 50%, whereas it completely prevented binding of the dimers to NA1NA1 neutrophils. Inhibition experiments with the MoAb against NA2 yielded the same results for NA1NA2 cells, whereas binding of IgG dimers to NA2NA2 cells was completely prevented. Thus, the products of both NA alleles bind IgG. Immunoprecipitation from the medium of neutrophils either stimulated with formyl- methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or treated with glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI- PLC) showed that both the NA1-FcRIII and the NA2-FcRIII are released from the cell surface, indicating that both forms of FcRIII have some structural features in common. Deglycosylation of FcRIII from homozygous donors yielded material that showed several bands on SDS-PAGE. GPI-PLC treatment of neutrophils indicated that all of this material is phosphatidyl-inositol linked.\r"

In addition to differences in subunit size and cellular compartmentalization of the isoenzymes, differences have been reported in their activity and susceptibility to inhibition. The structural basis of these isoenzymes is unclear; we attempted to further define their functional characteristics and structural identity. First, we measured respective enzymatic activity using a panel of substrates; MPO I was found to have lower activity with some substrates (pyrogallol, guaiacol, potassium iodide [KI]), but similar activity to the other isoenzymes with 4-aminoantipyrine. These studies confirm that MPO I is enzymatically distinct from MPO II and MPO III. Next, we examined the structural basis of these differences by evaluating the iron-containing prosthetic group in each form using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and determination of the pyridine hemochrome. No significant difference between the isoenzymes was noted in these parameters, suggesting that the prosthetic group is the same in each protein. The cause for any difference in enzymatic activity must lie then in variations extrinsic to the heme, and based on previous studies of the gene and protein analysis, the posttranslational modification of MPO must account for these isoenzymatic species.\r"

Under videomicroscopy, normal human erythrocytes were found to adhere to the venular endothelium of desmopressin-treated microvasculature. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the erythrocytes were attached to the endothelial cells at discrete electron-dense sites. Compared with control preparations in which the microvasculature was perfused with Ringer's-albumin solution alone, more than a 10-fold increase in radioactivity was retained in the desmopressin-treated microvasculature when technetium (99mTc)-labeled erythrocytes were infused into the vasculature. This erythrocyte adherence was accompanied by a higher increment in vascular resistance during the passage of RBCs through the microcirculation, and by a delay in the recovery toward baseline. The erythrocyte adherence in desmopressin-treated microvasculature was completely abolished with antibodies to von Willebrand factor (vWF). Desmopressin infusion in rats resulted in elevated vWF antigen levels and the appearance of extra-large molecular weight forms of vWF in plasma. These findings suggest that normal erythrocytes adhere to desmopressin-conditioned microvascular endothelium and that endothelial cell-derived vWF is involved in the erythrocyte-endothelium interaction.\r"

To determine if an additional red blood cell (RBC) defect was responsible for the unusual occurrence of frequent ASSCs, we performed detailed rheologic characterization and membrane protein analysis on RBCs from the proband and other members of his family. Reduced surface area, increased mechanical instability, and decreased spectrin content of the membrane, distinguishing features of RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis, were observed in cells from the proband and his mother, but not in cells from other family members. These findings are consistent with the dominant inheritance of spherocytosis by the proband. We suggest that the combined effects of SC disease and spherocytosis in the proband resulted in decreased RBC deformability and led to increased splenic trapping, intrasplenic sickling, and consequently, recurrent sequestration crisis. Marked clinical and hematologic improvement occurred from splenectomy. Thus, inheritance of interacting genetic defects, sickling hemoglobinopathy, and hereditary spherocytosis appear to be responsible for the unusual clinical manifestation of recurrent ASSC in this patient.\r"

  ".W": "A longitudinal, prospective, controlled evaluation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) of long bones in sickle cell patients was undertaken simultaneously with assessment of clinical status and hematologic parameters, including dense erythrocytes. MRI of bone marrow in sickle cell patients during steady states appeared patchy and were markedly different from those in matched controls (P approximately 0). Patients with severe patchiness were older than those with mild or moderate patchiness (P less than .03). Sixty-nine MRI were performed during 28 painful episodes occurring in 14 subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD). Increased signals on intermediate and T2-weighted images were detected in 35.7% of painful episodes. These abnormalities were distinct and not observed to occur spontaneously during the steady-state examinations (P approximately 0). Bone marrow infarcts were confirmed by biopsy in two instances and autopsy in one instance. Dense red cells decreased by 40.81% of baseline during pain crises (P = .00005), more remarkably in those who had pain in the lower extremities (P = .0145). Patients with change in MRI during pain crises had a greater percentage change in the dense cells than those without the change in MRI (69.7% v 31.3%, P = .0120).\r"

  ".W": "The erythrocyte membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL) is an 18-Kd protein that controls complement-mediated hemolysis by restricting the activity of the membrane attack complex. MIRL expression on the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is abnormally low, and the greater susceptibility of PNH erythrocytes to complement is causally related to this deficiency. Inasmuch as other proteins that are deficient in PNH are anchored to the membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol moiety, studies were undertaken to determine if MIRL shares this structural feature. Normal human erythrocytes that had been radiolabeled with 125I were incubated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), and the supernate and the solubilized membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-MIRL antiserum. The MIRL that was specifically released into the supernate had an Mr of 19 Kd, while the MIRL that remained bound to the membrane had an Mr of 18 Kd. A quantitative assay showed that approximately 10% of erythrocyte MIRL was susceptible to PIPLC; however, treatment with PIPLC had no effect on either the electrophoretic mobility or the functional activity of purified MIRL. These studies show that the effects of PIPLC on MIRL are similar to those observed for other human erythrocyte membrane proteins that are anchored by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol moiety.\r"

Titers of the incompatible anti-A agglutinin before infusion of the red blood cell (RBC)-depleted BMT was very high in one, and in the usual range in two patients. Decrease of agglutinin titers during the first 4 weeks after BMT were comparable between PRA patients and those of ABO-incompatible BMT recipients with timely RBC recovery. However, in PRA patients, agglutinin titers rose again and remained elevated for 19 to 28 weeks. RBC engraftment and reticulocyte recovery ultimately occurred spontaneously and coincided with the decrease of agglutinin titers below 16. These observations indicate that PRA is antibody-dependent in this setting. Furthermore, it is conceivable that cyclosporine facilitates recipient-derived antibody synthesis after major ABO-incompatible BMT.\r"

  ".U": "90105697\r", 
  ".W": "Mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) is a common finding after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but the natural history of this phenomenon remains unclear. To understand the evolution and the implications of this finding, we performed a prospective analysis of the development of mixed chimerism in 43 patients with hematologic malignancies who received bone marrow (BM) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donors. T-cell depletion in vitro with anti-T12 (CD6) monoclonal antibody and rabbit complement was used as the only method of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Overall, MC was identified in peripheral blood (PB) and BM in 22 of 43 (51%) patients evaluated. MC was found by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 21 of 40 (53%) patients, by cytogenetic analysis in 6 of 29 (21%) patients, and by red blood cell phenotyping in 4 of 9 (44%) patients. RFLP studies were performed at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-BMT and then every 6 months, and showed a high probability of developing MC in the first 6 months after BMT followed by stabilization after 12 months. Cytogenetic analysis was less sensitive in detecting MC. Once MC was detected after BMT, the percentage of recipient cells increased very slowly over more than 3 years of follow-up, and no patient reverted to complete donor hematopoiesis (CDH). Thus, recipient and donor cells remained in a relative state of equilibrium for prolonged periods that seemed to favor recipient cells over donor cells. Patient's disease, remission status, or intensity of the transplant preparative regimen did not influence the subsequent development of mixed chimerism. Early immunologic reconstitution was the only factor that correlated with the subsequent chimeric status of the patients. The percentage and absolute number of T3 (CD3) and T4 (CD4) positive cells at day 14 after BMT were significantly higher in the patients who maintained CDH but NK cell reconstitution was similar in both groups, suggesting that early reconstitution with T cells may play a role in preventing recovery of recipient cells after BMT. GVHD was also associated with maintenance of CDH, but the probability of relapse, survival, and disease-free survival was identical in patients with MC and CDH.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) shares several biologic properties with IL-1, including hematopoietin-1 activity and stimulation of T cells. Because many of their biologic activities overlap, we developed and used a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for IL-6 to compare production of this cytokine on a molar basis with that of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. The RIA correlated well with the hybridoma bioassay for IL-6 (r = .87, P less than .001). Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultured in the absence of stimuli did not produce IL-6 in most cases. Kinetics of secretion and cell-association of IL-6 were studied. In contrast to IL-1 alpha but similar to TNF, IL-6 was almost entirely secreted into the extracellular fluid. Incubation with different stimuli (lipopolysaccharide [LPS], phytohemagglutinin [PHA], Staphylococcus epidermidis, or IL-1 alpha) resulted in production of IL-6. However, on a molar basis PBMC produced approximately two to three times less IL-6 than IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or TNF, regardless of the stimulus. The amount of IL-6 produced from PBMC was consistent when measured in the same subjects six time during a 12-week period. In a cohort of 38 donors, the coefficient of variation for IL-6 production was .32, compared with .92 for IL-1 beta and .96 for TNF. Comparing cytokine production by PBMC, there was a significant correlation between IL-6 and IL-1 beta (r = .72) and between IL-6 and TNF (r = .66). IL-6 did not stimulate IL-1 beta or TNF production, but suppressed IL-1 beta and TNF production induced by LPS or PHA by 30% (P less than .01). This suppression of IL-1 beta and TNF by IL-6 appears to be on the level of transcription.\r"

IL-4 did not induce colony formation in semisolid medium, but enhanced generation of basophil colonies induced by conditioned medium (CM) of the bladder carcinoma cell line 5637. In liquid cultures, variable degrees of basophil growth were observed in the presence of IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, and 5637 CM, or even with IL-4 alone, but the highest number of basophils were obtained when IL-4 was used in combination with IL-3 or 5637 CM. Progressive basophil growth was observed during 3 to 4 weeks of culturing, whereafter the numbers of basophils remained stationary for another 3 weeks. Interestingly, cord blood cell cultures performed with IL-3 contained variable percentages of eosinophils that were further enhanced in the presence of combinations of IL-3 and IL-4. These latter cultures contained approximately 50% eosinophils and 50% basophils. Kinetic studies indicated that basophils were present 7 days after onset of the cultures, whereas eosinophils did not appear before day 13. In contrast to the pronounced effects of IL-4 and 5637 CM on basophil development, relatively low numbers of eosinophils were observed under these culture conditions. Our results indicate that eosinophil and basophil development are regulated by different sets of factors, and that IL-4 has an enhancing effect of both cell lineages in association with the appropriate factors.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the bone marrow (BM) megakaryocyte and the circulating platelet was explored. Incremental changes in platelet count were made in rats by infusion of antiplatelet antibody or by platelet transfusion, and the response of megakaryocytes was measured by flow cytometry. Proportional changes in megakaryocyte ploidy were demonstrated: As the platelet count declined, ploidy increased; as the platelet count increased, ploidy decreased. Even moderate degrees of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis (48% and 177% of the normal platelet count) were associated with changes in ploidy. These changes were not the results of the technique used to alter the platelet count because reinfusion of platelets after 3 hours of thrombocytopenia prevented any ploidy change. These studies proved that the circulating platelet and the megakaryocyte constitute a classic feedback loop whose activity can be measured by the degree of ploidization of the megakaryocyte. The minimal duration of thrombocytopenia necessary to promote megakaryocyte ploidy changes was approximately 10 hours. Using a BM culture assay, we identified a plasma factor which induced alterations in megakaryocyte ploidy and whose level is inversely proportional to the platelet count.\r"

Although transfer and expression of foreign genetic sequences into reconstituting stem cells is one approach to somatic gene therapy, few studies have shown long lasting phenotypic changes in recipient mice in vivo. In this study, we show successful transfer of a methotrexate-resistant cDNA (DHFRr) into reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells using a retroviral vector, FrDHFRr, in which the DHFR cDNA is expressed off a hybrid Friend/Moloney long term repeat. Both primary and secondary recipients transplanted with bone marrow cells infected with this recombinant retrovirus show improved survival and protection from methotrexate-induced marrow toxicity when compared with control animals. These data suggest that retroviral-mediated gene transfer of DHFRr cDNA leads to a stable change in the phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells and progeny derived from those cells in vivo after bone marrow transplantation. Gene transfer using recombinant retroviral vectors seems to be one rational approach to establishing chemotherapy-resistant bone marrow cells.\r"

We investigated the range of unfractionated, purified and single cell human progenitors responsive to IL-3; compared the colony types observed with those obtained in the presence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF). The results show that IL-3 directly stimulates the formation of colonies derived from eosinophil and, to a lesser degree, granulocyte and macrophage progenitors. In combination with erythropoietin, it supports the development of erythroid and mixed-erythroid colonies. Furthermore, the data show that IL-3 is a more potent stimulus for both erythroid and eosinophil progenitors than GM-CSF. Interleukin-3 stimulates the formation of both compact and dispersed colonies derived from eosinophil progenitors, whereas GM-CSF stimulates the formation of only the compact type. We conclude that some of the proliferative effects of IL-3 observed on unfractionated and semipurified bone marrow populations are indirect and most likely involve accessory cell interactions.\r"

The most sensitive assay was the TT, which was prolonged 2 and 3 times control values at 2.2 and 4.1 micrograms/mL hirudin peptide, respectively. The sulfated dodecapeptide exhibited no dependency on antithrombin III as monitored by the APTT in the presence of sheep anti-human antithrombin III antibodies, and its activity was not neutralized by platelet releasates or platelet factor 4. In studies of thrombin-induced platelet activation, the hirudin peptide was found to block aggregation, serotonin release and thromboxane A2 generation. At thrombin concentrations of 0.25 U/mL, the IC50 (concentration resulting in 50% inhibition) for inhibition of platelet aggregation was 0.72 micrograms/mL peptide. Inhibition of TXA2 generation and serotonin release correlated closely with inhibition of aggregation. Using platelets from patients with clinically documented heparin-induced thrombocytopenia anticoagulant doses of heparin were found to induce platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation. In sharp contrast, anticoagulant-equivalent doses of hirudin peptide had no effect on patient platelets, as evidenced by a lack of platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation. These data provide compelling in vitro evidence that the hirudin peptide has several potential advantages over heparin, namely effective inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet activities, co-factor independence, insensitivity to endogenous heparin-neutralizing factors, and an apparent lack of direct or immune-mediated platelet stimulating properties.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphocytosis manifested in infectious mononucleosis (IM) during acute phase is ascribed to a reactive expansion of CD8+ T lymphocytes caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B lymphocytes. Expression of HLA-DR antigen on IM lymphocytes suggests that these T lymphocytes are somehow activated in vivo. In the present study, we analyzed the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor expression on lymphocytes from six patients with acute IM. Radiolabeled IL-2 binding assay revealed that IM lymphocytes from all patients examined had a considerable number of IL-2 binding sites with an intermediate affinity, although they did not express the IL-2 receptor recognized by anti-Tac antibody (p55). The number of binding sites (1,070 to 4,600 sites per cell) was larger than that of a normal, resting T lymphocyte-enriched population (650 sites per cell). Furthermore, IM lymphocytes showed marked proliferative responses to higher concentrations of IL-2, which were almost completely blocked by an anti-p70 IL-2 receptor antibody, indicating that their IL-2 receptor is a functional receptor. The results of an affinity cross-linking study seem to indicate that the IL-2 receptor expressed on IM lymphocytes is p70, the second chain of the IL-2 receptor distinct from p55. Flow cytometric analysis following immunofluorescent staining with anti-p70 IL-2 receptor antibody confirmed p70 expression on CD8+ HLA-DR+ lymphocytes. These data suggest that p70 IL-2 receptor expression is involved in the immune response triggered by EBV infection.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) on connective tissue-type mast cells (CTMC) purified from murine peritoneal cells. Although both factors failed to induce extensive proliferation of CTMC, they stimulated CTMC proliferation synergistically in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of CTMC with IL-3 and/or IL-4 indicated that the sustained presence of both factors was required for the development of type 1 mast cell colonies. The delayed addition of IL-3 to cultures of purified CTMC with IL-4 induced no colony formation, while the delayed addition of IL-4 to cultures with IL-3, even on day 28 of culture, induced type 1 colony formation. In replating type 1 colonies induced by IL-3 and IL-4 to secondary cultures with IL-3 alone, few secondary colonies developed. However, the delayed addition of IL-4 to the secondary culture induced many type 1 colonies. The purified CTMC cultured with IL-3 retained the morphological and cytochemical characteristics of CTMC, as well as proliferative ability. These observations indicate that IL-3 supports the survival of CTMC in methylcellulose culture and that IL-4 triggers and supports CTMC proliferation synergistically with IL-3. The serum-free culture of purified CTMC and the culture of single CTMC demonstrated that the synergistic effect of IL-3 and IL-4 on colony growth and the surviving effect of IL-3 on CTMC require no influence from accessory cells or other humoral factors.\r"

  ".W": "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral integration status was examined by Southern blot analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA from patients presenting a tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and serological evidence of HTLV-I infection. Surface phenotype and morphological aspects of PBMC were also studied. A polyclonal HTLV-I proviral integration was found in the PBMC of the 10 patients studied irrespective of their geographical origin (French West Indies, French Guiana, and Africa), the duration of their clinical illness, or the HTLV-I antibody titer. Furthermore, by dilution experiments and hypothesizing that only one copy of HTLV-I proviral DNA is present in one cell, we estimated that this HTLV-I integration is present in 3% to 15% of their PBMC. All 10 TSP/HTLV-I patients studied had an average of 10% of their lymphocytes abnormal, presenting either a misshapen nucleus or an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)-like feature. Moreover, an elevated CD4/CD8 ratio associated with the presence of activated T cells with a high level of DR expression was observed in most patients. The significant frequency of viral-positive PBMC and the important load of HTLV-I proviral DNA that we observed in TSP/HTLV-I patients might play an important role in the pathogenesis of this recently identified clinico-virological entity.\r"

The cytochrome was not found on the surface of peripheral T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, or peripheral lymphocytes derived from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease. On stimulation, at least half of peripheral B lymphocytes could generate superoxide anion as detected by superoxide dismutase-sensitive nitroblue tetrazorium reduction. Cytochrome b558 was not present on the surface of pre-pre B cells or pre-B cells, but did appear at the early B-cell stage. It disappeared from the B-cell surface during terminal differentiation to plasma cells. The transient expression of the cytochrome in B-cell lineage may indicate that superoxide generation is important for the function of these cells at certain stages.\r"

  ".U": "90105734\r", 
  ".W": "We previously found that the myeloid cell surface glycoprotein CD13 (gp150) is identical to aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2), a widely distributed membrane-bound, zinc-dependent metalloprotease with an extracellular enzymatic domain that cleaves N-terminal amino acid residues from oligopeptides (J Clin Invest 83:1299, 1989). As a first step toward defining the function of this molecule on myeloid cells, we assessed cell surface-associated N-terminal peptidase activity by sensitive spectrophotometric measurements of the cleavage of p-nitroanilide amino acid derivatives. Aminopeptidase activity detected on the surface of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells coincided with the level of cell surface CD13 expression as measured by flow cytometry. The enzyme was specifically inhibited by the zinc-binding metalloprotease inhibitors, bestatin, 1,10-phenanthroline, or 2.2'-dipyridyl, but was not affected by several inhibitors of other classes of proteases. Aminopeptidase activity was demonstrated for CD13 molecules specifically immunoprecipitated from the surface of CD13-positive cells and was blocked by the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. Moreover, cell surface aminopeptidase activity was partially inhibited when viable cells were incubated with two of a panel of 11 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) known to be specific for extracellular epitopes of human CD13. This inhibition was apparent in the absence of detectable downmodulation of CD13 molecules from the cell surface, suggesting that these MoAbs either physically interfere with substrate binding or alter the zinc-coordinating properties of aminopeptidase N molecules. Aminopeptidase N could play an important role in modulating signals generated by peptides at the surface of myeloid cells, either by removing key N-terminal residues from active peptides or by converting inactive peptides to active forms. The inhibitory antibodies used in this study should prove useful in delineating the physiologic roles of CD13/aminopeptidase N on normal and malignant myeloid cells.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma fibronectin augments the clearance of blood-borne foreign and effete complexes by mononuclear phagocytes. The release of a \"gelatin-like\" ligand into plasma after thermal injury has been reported. We quantified the release of this collagenous debris from thermally injured skin, and its potential interaction with soluble fibronectin in plasma using anesthetized rats. Collagen-like material debris in the plasma was detected by assay of hydroxyproline. Fibronectin was measured by a double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Over a 24-hour postburn interval, plasma hydroxyproline increased from 6.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mL to a maximum of 19.0 +/- 3.3 micrograms/mL at 60 minutes postburn, and normalized by 6 hours. A direct correlation existed between the magnitude of burn injury and the increase in plasma hydroxyproline. In parallel, plasma fibronectin declined over a 15-minute to 2-hour period postburn, and normalized by 3 to 4 hours with rebound hyperfibronectinemia observed at 24 hours. The elevation in total plasma hydroxyproline was not due to an increase in plasma Clq (zero time, 26.2 +/- 1.4 micrograms/mL; 60 minutes, 23.9 +/- 1.1 micrograms/mL). Tracer studies with 125I-fibronectin showed that the acute decline of plasma fibronectin was due to its uptake by the liver and binding to sites of tissue injury. Total hydroxyproline in extracts of burn skin, used as an index of soluble collagenous material, rose from 15 +/- 3.3 micrograms/g skin at zero time to 129.3 +/- 43.7 micrograms/g skin by 5 minutes postburn, with a decline to 38 +/- 22 micrograms/g skin by 24 hours. The formation of circulating fibronectin-gelatin complexes in vivo was documented by cross-immunoelectrophoresis coupled with autoradiography using 125I-gelatin as a model ligand. Thus, collagenous tissue debris from burned skin may enter the plasma after thermal injury and directly complexes with soluble fibronectin before hepatic phagocytic clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Investigations of protein kinase C (PKC) activity have focussed on protein phosphorylation using adenosine triphosphate (ATP), not guanosine triphosphate (GTP), as the phosphate donor. In a continuing study of the enzymology of the PKC of human neutrophils, we wanted to determine if there might be protein kinases that do use GTP as a phosphate donor. Soluble extracts or detergent-extracted fractions of human neutrophils were used as enzyme sources. Phosphorylation of histone using [gamma-32P]-GTP was 31% as effective as [gamma-32P]-ATP. Phosphorylation with GTP depended on Ca2+, Mg2+, and phospholipid, just as the ATP, and the Ca2+ requirements were similar. In all cases, H-7, an inhibitor of ATP-supported PKC activity, blocked GTP-utilizing activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed that similar endogenous proteins were phosphorylated with ATP or GTP. The apparent Km and Vmax for the enzyme(s) for both phosphate donors were identical, although these were modified by treatment with Triton X-100. GTP competitively inhibited use of ATP by PKC; however, low concentrations of ATP enhanced GTP-utilizing kinase activity in some cases. Non-hydrolyzable forms of ATP and other nucleotide triphosphates were inhibitory. Detergent treatment also markedly altered the number of proteins phosphorylated by either nucleotide. The major protein phosphorylated in the soluble or detergent extract was a single polypeptide band in the 34 Kd range. These studies are the first to explicitly examine the possible phosphorylation by neutrophil PKC using GTP and point to a potential alternative mode of enzyme activity. Since high concentrations of GTP are available within neutrophils, the ability of PKC or a PKC-like enzyme to use this nucleotide may have important ramifications in signal transduction.\r"

The DNA sequence of the patient's gamma-globin genes corresponds to a previously identified sequence framework (chromosome A) with the exception of 10 base changes. Seven of these base changes can be attributed to normal allelic variation generated by small gene conversion events. The remaining three base changes are present in a 0.76 kb HindIII fragment containing a putative enhancer located 3' to the A gamma-globin gene. The same three base changes have also been described in the Seattle variant of nondeletion HPFH. We have analyzed 16 alleles from non-HPFH individuals and five alleles from individuals with nondeletion or deletion HPFH for the presence of these base changes by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cloned or chromosomal DNA and hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. Although these base changes were found in an individual with HPFH-2, they were not found in the DNA from two patients with nondeletion HPFH. More importantly, all three base changes were detected in DNA from five non-HPFH individuals and appear to be common in blacks. We conclude that these base changes do not correlate with an HPFH phenotype and that the significant mutation in HPFH-1 is the deletion of over 100 kb of genomic DNA.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the sequential expression of major blood group antigens on human erythroblasts, a selective two phase liquid culture system for erythroid progenitors was established. After mononuclear cells obtained from peripheral blood were cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin stimulated-leukocyte conditioned medium (PHA-LCM) for 7 days (the first phase), nonphagocytic cells were recultured under hypoxic culture conditions containing 30% fetal calf serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 300 micrograms/mL transferrin and 2 U/mL recombinant erythropoietin (the second phase). Mature (orthochromatic) erythroblasts were observed on day 4 of the second phase, and reached 57.1 +/- 3.1% of total cells on day 8, followed by the appearance of denucleated red cells, equivalent to mature red cells in peripheral blood. Hemoglobin contents reached the level of 16.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/10(6) cells on day 8. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that, on day 3 of the second phase, cells became blood type M-positive, corresponding to the maturation of erythroid cells. Regarding the expression of ABH blood group antigens, a small number of blood type H-positive cells were initially detected on day 0 of the second phase, while blood type A-positive cells, which essentially were not observed on day 0, increased gradually corresponding to the extent of erythroid maturation. In the present system, Lewis and P1 blood group antigens were expressed at day 5 of the second phase, although autologous plasma was required to determine the expression of Lewis blood group antigens. This culture system is beneficial for studies on normal and abnormal human red cell membranes, because the erythroid progenitors in human peripheral blood were used, and a reasonable number of erythroid cells (0.5 to 1.5 x 10(7] was obtained with good maturation.\r"

We tried to prevent alloimmunization in these patients by systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components with less than one million of contaminating leukocytes per unit of platelets or red cells. Our study group comprised 26 patients with a minimum of 10 platelet transfusions per patient. These patients were compared with a historical reference group of 21 patients who had received standard blood products. In the leukocyte-free group none developed platelet refractoriness, in contrast to the reference group where 11 of the 21 patients became refractory to random platelets. The median corrected platelet increment for random pooled platelets was significantly higher in the leukocyte-free group compared with the reference group. The increasing number of transfusions did not correlate with the development of platelet refractoriness; instead we propose that the lower limit of antigenic exposure is important. We conclude that systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components effectively prevents development of platelet refractoriness and contributes to optimal supportive care of children with cancer.\r"

In one patient, withdrawal of drug and administration of platelet transfusions restored platelet counts to near normal levels (approximately 100 x 10(9)/L), however, subsequent challenge with vancomycin due to recurring infection again precipitated severe thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 10 x 10(9)/L) and life-threatening hemorrhagic symptoms. Potent vancomycin-dependent antiplatelet antibodies were detected in the serum of both patients during the refractory period using staphylococcal protein A rosette formation. Employing a monoclonal antibody-antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the patients were found to have vancomycin-dependent IgG antibodies that bound specifically to platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb and/or IIIa. One of these antibodies failed to react with platelets deficient in GPIIb/IIIa obtained from an individual with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. These findings provide the first major evidence for drug-dependent antibodies in association with severe thrombocytopenia and refractoriness to platelet transfusion in alloimmunized leukemia patients and, further, provide the first demonstration of vancomycin-dependent antibodies reactive with platelets.\r"

Thirty patients had intradural lesions and five had extradural lesions. A variable pattern of enhancement of intramedullary tumours was found, which in part reflected differences in the cystic component of the lesions. Extramedullary intra- and extradural lesions generally showed marked enhancement. The greatest contribution to management decisions was in the evaluation of intramedullary tumours where the use of contrast enhancement facilitated the precise localization of active tumour, differentiation of cystic and solid components of tumour, separation of tumour from peritumoral oedema and, in cases of suspected recurrence, aided distinction between tumour and both post-operative scarring and radiation damage.\r"

  ".W": "Colony-forming ability after exposure to ionizing irradiation was compared for proliferating hormone response MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and cells whose growth was inhibited by tamoxifen or 17B-estradiol. As compared with controls (Do = 1.20 Gy, n = 3.1), cells in 1 microM or 5 microM tamoxifen were less radiosensitive (Do = 1.20 Gy, n = 7.0; Do = 1.22 Gy, n = 7.0, respectively) with the predominant effect being a widened shoulder on the survival curve. This protective effect could be abolished by co-incubation of 5 microM tamoxifen with 100 nM 17B-estradiol (Do = 1.30 Gy, n = 2.6; Do = 1.20 Gy, n = 2.6, respectively). The decrease in radiosensitivity induced by tamoxifen was similar to that seen when replating of irradiated plateau-phase cultures was delayed for 24 h (Do = 1.30 Gy, n = 6.0). In contrast, when proliferation of MCF-7 cultures was inhibited by 10 microM 17B-estradiol, radiosensitivity was increased with a markedly diminished survival curve shoulder (Do = 1.40 Gy, n = 1.0). Different hormonal manipulations of cycling human breast carcinoma cells may have profound but disparate effects on radiosensitivity such that tamoxifen and estrogens may serve as useful agents with which to study the biochemical mechanisms of repair.\r"

It was shown that the amount of sublethal damage that was repaired in this dose range was equal in cells growing in monolayers and as MTS. The radiosensitivity of spheroids, as expressed by spheroid \"cure\" dose, increased with increasing MTS diameter. It is postulated that, in MTS with no signs of hypoxia, radioresistance diminishes when MTS increase in diameter.\r"

Two hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent elective operation and the 50 acutely symptomatic patients were operated on as emergencies. The overall mortality for the non-ruptured series was 2.9 per cent.

One month after surgery 52 per cent of limbs were asymptomatic and 77 per cent were at least improved. A follow-up examination was performed, on average 6.1 years after the operation, by two independent examiners. This evaluation showed a permanent success rate of 37 per cent among 84 limbs examined. These long term results compare unfavourably with previously published data. The reason for the poor final outcome seemed to be difficulty in selecting patients for the operation. This was not aided by any of the preoperative tests. Patients in this study were evaluated by independent examiners, and only a total absence of preceding symptoms was accepted as the criterion for success. We emphasize the importance of unbiased evaluation and long term follow-up.\r"

Indium-111 labelled endothelial cells were then seeded on to the grafts and left for either 10, 30, 60 or 120 min. The unattached cells were removed and the degree of cell attachment was calculated. All coatings were significantly better at enhancing endothelial cell attachment at all times compared with controls, and fibronectin was significantly better as a coating material than any other material used. By pretreating with a substance such as fibronectin, the number of endothelial cells attaching to PTFE vascular grafts can be greatly increased, thereby enhancing the cell seeding process.\r"

When the physicians used their normal technique, the mean sample weight increased significantly with experience, from 4.6 mg in the least experienced group to 17.2 mg in the group with the longest experience. Thirty-six per cent of the samples taken by the group with the least experience were in the weight class 0-2 mg, whereas no such samples were encountered for the other groups. When all the physicians were advised to use the same, standard technique there were no statistically significant differences in mean sample weight between the groups or in the proportion of samples in class 0-2 mg. Sample weights correlated significantly (P less than 0.001) with cell counts. This study shows that differences in the technique of FNAC are responsible for differences in sample weights and cell counts, including the number of the acellular samples obtained. This could explain in some part the wide variation in the reported accuracy rates of FNAC.\r"

Six of these patients had undergone previous thyroid resections for MCT and, although asymptomatic at the time of pentavalent DMSA scintigraphy, had persistent and serial elevations in their plasma calcitonin levels. One additional patient was scanned before and after total thyroidectomy for MCT. The pentavalent DMSA scintigram demonstrated either local neck recurrence (three patients) or distant metastases (two patients) in five of the six asymptomatic patients. In one asymptomatic patient only equivocal neck uptake was demonstrated. Since he had only minimal calcitonin elevations, repeat neck exploration was not performed. The one patient studied before thyroid resection for MCT demonstrated neck uptake before, but not after, total thyroidectomy. The results of the scintigrams had significant impact on patient care and resulted in neck re-exploration (three patients), neck biopsy (one patient), and lumbar spine biopsy and subsequent radiotherapy (one patient). These data demonstrate pentavalent DMSA to be a sensitive localizing agent in the evaluation of asymptomatic MCT patients with hypercalcitonaemia. Accurate targeting of treatment may be shown in due course to have a beneficial impact on survival.\r"

Few had attended craft workshops or travelled to other centres, but of those who had, most considered both activities to be very useful.

The male:female ratio was 2.8:1 and the mean age was 66 years (range 22-91 years). Oesophagogastrectomy (n = 514) was performed whenever technically possible. From the first (1960-64) to the last (1980-84) 5-year period the proportion of adenocarcinomas increased from 56 to 78 per cent (P less than 0.001), poorly differentiated cancers increased from 34 to 65 per cent (P less than 0.0001), and stage III-IV tumours increased from 72 to 88 per cent (P less than 0.05). Five-year cumulative rates(s.e.) were 11(3) per cent for operations during 1960-69 (n = 262), 8(2) per cent during 1970-79 (n = 256) and 3(2) per cent during 1980-84 (n = 139; P less than 0.05). Hospital mortality rates (less than or equal to 30 days) and 5-year cumulative survival rates(s.e.) were 6.5 per cent and 36(7) per cent (n = 46) for stage I, 14.0 per cent and 21(4) per cent (n = 114) for stage II, 17.8 per cent and 5(1) per cent (n = 258) for stage III and 23.8 per cent and 3(1) per cent (n = 239) for stage IV tumours (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001). Well differentiated (n = 70) cancers, those of medium differentiation (n = 239) and poorly differentiated cancers (n = 348) had 5-year survival rates(s.e.) of 24(5), 10(2) and 5(1) per cent, respectively (P = 0.0007). Squamous cell carcinomas had a better prognosis than adenocarcinomas, even after stratification according to location of primary tumour. The 657 patients who underwent surgery constituted 50 per cent of a total of 1316 cases with cancer of the oesophagus and cardia reported from our catchment area during the study period. Frequency of surgery decreased with age. The annual incidence (number per 100,000 inhabitants aged 20 years or more) of adenocarcinomas of the lower oesophagus and cardia doubled to 5.9 in 1980-84, while that of squamous cell carcinomas tended to decrease (to 2.9). A successive worsening of long-term survival after surgery was explained by significant changes in cancer characteristics having pronounced prognostic significance. Over the 25 years the carcinomas changed towards the present pattern where poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of the lower third of the oesophagus and cardia in stages III-IV have become predominant.\r"

Of the 395 patients 287 (73%) had not used alternative medicine, and 36 (9%) had sought alternative medical care for the problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. There were no significant differences between alternative medicine users and nonusers in sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services or general health status. Patients with a functional disease were more likely to seek alternative medical care than those with organic disease (33% v. 7%) (p less than 0.0001). Fewer alternative medicine users (54%) than nonusers (85%) were satisfied with conventional medicine (p less than 0.001), and more alternative medicine users (49%) than nonusers (13%) were very sceptical of conventional medicine (p less than 0.0001).\r"

Of these, 266 (92%) returned a questionnaire regarding any symptoms experienced within 48 hours after vaccination; 238 (90%) of the respondents reported adverse effects. Soreness at the injection site was described by 229 subjects, 58 (25%) of whom had constant aching and 123 (54%) soreness with arm movement. Symptoms resolved in 1 to 2 days, and only 21 (9%) of those who reported symptoms said they took analgesic medication. Systemic adverse effects were described by 130 subjects (49%). Intercurrent illness accounted for some of these complaints, but 65 people (24%) described at least two of the following symptoms: generalized aching, tiredness, nausea, chills or onset of fever within 12 hours after vaccination (a symptom complex previously attributed to influenza vaccine). Systemic symptoms resolved within 0.5 to 2 days. Thirteen subjects (5%) reported missing work because of arm soreness (1 subject) or systemic symptoms (12). Adverse effects were encountered more often than expected, probably because most of the workers were young and lacked immunity to influenza. Acceptability of the program could likely be improved by using a split-virus vaccine.\r"

In this study, the kinetics of two plasma tumor markers, CEA and CA15-3, immediately after the initiation of chemotherapy were assessed in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer. Four distinct kinetic patterns were seen. Two patterns fitted the expected relationship where the plasma marker increased during tumor progression (nine patients), and declined in tumor regression (five patients). The third pattern was paradoxical in that objective tumor regression in eight patients was associated with an acute surge of these markers followed by a steady decline. The doubling times for both CEA and CA15-3 were immediately shortened four-fold after therapy suggesting tumor cytolysis in treatment responders. Equally paradoxical was the fourth pattern where tumor progression in eight patients was associated with a rapid and transient decline of markers followed by rebounds. Such a rapid decline may be due to a suppression of marker release, as demonstrated in an in vitro study. Adequate knowledge of these putative paradoxical patterns will permit their effective use in monitoring the disease course and perhaps in the early prediction of the therapeutic response.\r"

Five of the six lesions were Stage I pathologically without evidence of axillary nodal involvement. It is recommended that female patients with Hodgkin's disease who have received mantle irradiation as part of the therapy for their Hodgkin's disease and who are observed for 10 or more years after completion of mantle irradiation be considered at risk for the development of breast cancer. Such patients should be monitored appropriately by routine bilateral mammograms to increase the early detection of early stage lesions.\r"

A systematic evaluation of RIA somatostatin (SRIH) was performed in 34 medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) (25 inherited, seven sporadic). Plasma SRIH was measured by radioimmunoassay in parallel with calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Immunoassayable SRIH was tested in fresh tumoral tissue samples from the same 34 MTC and, for comparison, in 10 nontumoral thyroid extracts (less than 6 pmol/g wet). Although plasma SRIH was only slightly elevated in two of 20 cases, tumoral SRIH was elevated in 70.6% of our MTC (10 to 3973 pmol/g). The chromatography of two tumoral extracts showed that somatostatin 14 was the major molecular form. We found no correlation (P greater than 0.1) between tumoral SRIH and the following: (1) tumor size (r = 0.227); (2) epidemiologic form of MTC (r = 0.144); (3) plasma SRIH (r = 0.045), plasma CT (R = 0.095) or (4) plasma CEA (r = 0.032). Thus, in the authors' experience, SRIH appears as a major product of tumoral C-cell in human MTC, even when plasma SRIH is normal and SRIH immunohistochemical staining is scarce. Multiple hormonal production of these tumors may explain its presence but SRIH may act also as a regulator, since negative influence of SRIH on CT is demonstrated in normal as well in tumoral conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between the histologic feature of mucin leakage into the cervical stroma, lymph node metastasis, and the levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, and CA 125 were analyzed in 35 cases of cervical adenocarcinoma. Histologically, mucin leakage was identified in 14 (40%) cases as amorphorous materials dissecting the connective tissues and permeating the lymphatic channels, associated with or without cancer cells. The cases with mucin leakage showed a significantly higher incidence of lymph node involvement than those without mucin leakage (71.4% versus 23.8%; P less than 0.01). In addition, when the mucin leakage was immunohistochemically positive for CEA or CA 19-9, elevated serum levels of these antigens were frequently observed. These results suggest that the mucin leakage into the cervical stroma represents not only stromal invasion, but also a means that frequently conducts cancer cells into the lymphatic channels. Clinically, this is reflected in an elevation of serum CEA or CA 19-9 levels in cervical adenocarcinoma patients.\r"

None of the tumors reacted with HPV 6 or HPV 11. Using in situ hybridization with 3H-labeled DNA probes nine of the 16 cancers gave positive results with HPV 16. Only three of the nine were positive for HPV 16 by in situ hybridization with biotinylated probes. Currently, the method of in situ hybridization with commercial biotinylated probes is less sensitive than in situ hybridization with 3H-labeled HPV DNA.\r"

Clonal chromosome aberrations were found in one of six benign tumors and in seven of ten malignant tumors. A chondroma had a complex translocation involving chromosomes X, 8, 12, and 13, as well as a deletion of the derivative chromosome 8. In the malignant tumors, monosomy 6 and 22 were observed in three tumors and monosomy 10, 11, 13, and 18 were observed in two tumors. In two of the three metastasizing tumors, del(5) (q13) and loss of chromosomes 6, 10, 11, 13, and 22 were common features. Structural aberrations of chromosome 1 were found in five tumors, of chromosomes 6, 12, and 15 in three tumors, and of chromosomes 4, 5, 9, and 20 in two tumors. We conclude that although considerable cytogenetic heterogeneity exists among chondromatous tumors, the karyotypic anomalies are still nonrandom.\r"

However, analysis of DNA isolated from the spleen failed to show clonal T-cell receptor beta-chain gene, T-cell receptor gamma-chain gene, or immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and light chain gene rearrangements.

Cases of CGNB were divided on the basis of the morphologic features of neuroblastic elements into three prognostic subgroups: \"Type A Intermixed,\" having individual microscopic nests of neuroblasts (N = 4, 100% survival); \"Type B Intermixed,\" having microscopic aggregates of multiple neuroblastic nests (N = 6, 67% survival); and \"Nodular,\" having grossly visible nodule(s) of neuroblastic proliferation (N = 8, 0% survival). Survival rates are significantly different for the prognostic subgroups (P less than 0.025). Each prognostic subgroup demonstrated an immunohistochemically distinct pattern of stromal cell composition in the neuroblastic elements: Type A Intermixed had numerous S-100 cells and no FER cells, Type B Intermixed contained many S-100 cells and a moderate number of FER cells, and Nodular had few S-100 cells with many FER cells. The S-100 and FER scores, determined by counting the positive cells through a line sampling method, differed significantly between these prognostic subgroups. Lymphocytic aggregations in tumor tissue evaluated by volumetric assessment with LCA staining, on the other hand, showed no contribution in predicting the outcome of the patients. There was also an inverse relationship between S-100 and FER score, suggesting a relationship between the relative predominance of these stromal cell types, tumor histopathologic features, and the biologic behavior of CGNB.\r"

Granular staining of tumor cell cytoplasm was detected in 62 cases. Positive staining was associated with a significant increase in overall time to relapse and when survival was analyzed in terms of intensity of cathepsin D staining there was a significant trend for both increased time to relapse and increased length of survival. The presence of estrogen receptor was associated with positive cathepsin D immunostaining, and in the subgroup of estrogen receptor-positive tumors cathepsin D staining was associated with significantly prolonged survival; this was not the case for estrogen receptor-negative tumors. Positive cathepsin D immunostaining was associated with significant prognostic advantage in patients with confirmed lymph node metastasis but not in node-negative patients. It is suggested that cathepsin D expression reflects the functional integrity of the estrogen response pathway. Cathepsin D may prove a clinically useful adjunct to assessment of estrogen receptor status.\r"

All metastases were squamous carcinoma. All patients were eligible for a minimum of 5 years' follow-up; the cumulative 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 63%. Eight women developed metastases and one also developed local recurrence, all within 2 years, and all eight died from tumor within 4 years of initial therapy (mean, 2 years). Prophylactic postoperative radiation therapy and radiation for lymph node metastases at initial surgery did not prolong survival as four of the five recipients died from tumor. Although there were no statistically significant gross or histologic differences between recurrent and nonrecurrent neoplasms, larger neoplasms tended to metastasize. Immunohistochemical study for S-100 protein identified an immunoreactive cell component in five of seven neoplasms tested. This and light microscopic findings suggest myoepithelial proliferation, differentiation, or origin.\r"

Only three of the five patients demonstrated suspicious findings of hemorrhagic cyst fluid, a residual mass after NAB, or refilling of the cyst. Due to the relatively young age of most patients, the innocuous clinical presentation, and the abundant inflammatory component noted in the aspiration biopsy cytologic study (ABC), misinterpretation as an inflamed cyst is possible.

The remaining two patients, who were 47 and 60 years of age, were considered to have had the onset in their youth. There were few subjective symptoms, and the lesion was most often detected as a palpation of a mass by the patients themselves. Although the prognosis was generally favorable, the two older patients died of metastases. This suggested low-grade malignancy of PCN. The tumors were large (6.9 cm in mean diameter) and encapsulated, and their cross-sections showed an intermingling of solid tumoral areas and cystic necrotic areas. The histologic features of the solid tumoral portion were relatively uniform, with the tumor cells showing solid and pseudopapillary or pseudoglandular proliferation but few mitoses or atypism. Histochemical, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic examinations showed polymorphic differentiation, which means that part of the tumor cells differentiated into duct epithelium, acinus, and endocrine cells (primary constituents of the pancreas). These findings suggest that the origin of PCN is totipotential primordial cells found in the development of the embryonic pancreas.\r"

However, a few patients receiving adjuvant therapy have died under circumstances that make it difficult to determine whether the tumor was responsible for the death. It is suggested that adjuvant therapy be withheld from patients with WDPMP, unless there is clear evidence of progression. The cause of these rare tumors is not apparent, although three patients had had possible exposure to asbestos and two were sisters.\r"

It has demonstrated clinical use in the etiologic study of Raynaud's phenomenon. We consider a \"vascular activity pattern\" to be present at capillary microscopy when one of the following associations is observed: tortuous capillary vessels plus ramifications with or without loss of a moderate amount of capillaries. Capillary tortuousity alone is not considered pathologic. It is well known that bleomycin (BLEO) can occasionally induce vascular-associated diseases. To examine the vascular damage produced by BLEO, we performed capillary microscopic studies on 40 patients with neoplasia, 21 of whom had received BLEO during the previous year. The maximum accumulated doses ranged from 15 to 379 U. The other 19 patients had advanced neoplasia, and 10 of them had received antitumoral combinations that did not contain BLEO. No one had clinical signs attributable to vascular toxicity. Twenty-six patients had no pathologic patterns (11 received BLEO and 15 did not). In the group of 14 patients with activity patterns, 10 had received BLEO and 4 had not (P = 0.035). Ten of 11 patients treated with BLEO who had normal capillary microscopic studies received total doses of less than 100 U.

The first category is a locally infiltrative glomus tumor (LIGT) which has the usual glomus histologic features. The second group is a cytologically malignant tumor arising and merging with a typical glomus tumor, designated glomangiosarcoma arising in a benign glomus (GABG). The third category and the most difficult to recognize is the de novo glomangiosarcoma (GADN), which must be distinguished from other round cell sarcomas. Most of these locally aggressive glomus tumors are vimentin positive and are immunoreactive for muscle-specific actin. Electron microscopic examination in one GABG case showed cells with numerous microfilaments and pinocytotic vesicles; a second GADN case contained cells with microfilaments and an incomplete basal lamina. As a group these locally aggressive or potentially malignant glomus tumors are larger and more deeply located than the conventional glomus tumor. Although 50% of these tumors recurred locally, none have metastasized.\r"

Fifteen episodes of CNS involvement developed in ten of 99 patients (10.1%); nine had leptomeningeal involvement, whereas two developed intracerebral invasion, one developed cord involvement, and one developed both. CNS involvement was more frequent in the lymphoma type than in the other types of ATLL. Nuchal rigidity was not common (33%) and a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) occurred in association with CNS involvement (40%). Three episodes of marked hypoglycorrhachia also were noticed. The systemic progression of ATLL was the most common setting of CNS involvement (80%) and the major cause of death (80%). As for the acute and lymphoma types of ATLL, no significant difference was observed in survival between patients with and those without CNS involvement. These results indicate that CNS involvement is not an essential prognostic factor of ATLL and that it should be treated with systemic chemotherapy coupled with intrathecal chemotherapy. The control of systemic ATLL is important for the prophylaxis of CNS involvement.\r"

The group included 13 male and five female patients with a median age at diagnosis of 23 years (range, 4-46 years). All patients underwent surgical resection, 16 of 18 received radiation therapy (12 limited-field irradiation and four whole-brain with or without a posterior fossa boost), and 16 of 18 received chemotherapy. Overall median survival was 31.5 months (range, 5-366 months). Ten patients (55%) died of recurrent disease with a median survival of 32 months (range, 5-128 months), two of whom manifested metastatic disease within the central nervous system (one parietal lobe and one cervical cord). Of the two extracerebellar metastatic recurrences, one patient failed at the junction of whole-brain irradiation and the cervical cord and one patient failed after inadequate posterior fossa irradiation. Eight patients (45%) are alive with a median follow-up of 27.5 months (range, 14-366 months). In this series recurrences of primary cerebellar anaplastic gliomas were locoregional failures. As a consequence, the authors suggest high-dose limited-field irradiation directed at the primary tumor as in their current strategy utilized for supratentorial gliomas.\r"

In a time trends analysis, the distributions of three of the prognostic factors (thickness of the tumor, ulceration, and inflammatory cell infiltrate) were found to shift during the last decade in the direction of improved prognosis, indicating that tumors are detected earlier than before. The distributions of two other factors (cell type and location of the tumors) shifted in the direction of deteriorated prognosis, suggesting partly that the biologic nature of the disease may have changed and partly that other behavioral factors may have played a role.\r"

There were eight male patients and nine female patients. The most common tumor location (seven patients) was the foot, followed by the area around the knee (four patients). The usual histologic pattern was that of variably sized nests of uniform plump spindle cells with clear to pale cytoplasm separated by fine to coarse fibrous septa; however, variants with a substantial proportion of epithelioid cells, moderate to marked nuclear pleomorphism, predominantly diffuse growth, or a microcystic pattern were seen. Patient survival was relatively poor overall (median, 49 months; ten deaths due to tumor) and was determined mainly by distant metastasis (11 patients). Both survival and distant metastasis were correlated with tumor size (P less than 0.01 for patients with tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm versus less than 5 cm). Other clinical and pathologic factors, including patient age, sex, and race, tumor location, duration of symptoms, initial therapy, mitotic rate, tumor necrosis, proportion of epithelioid cells, and nuclear pleomorphism had no significant relation to survival or distant metastasis when tumor size was taken into account. Local recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis each occurred in four patients.\r"

From the 2560 persons screened for melanoma/skin cancer in Massachusetts in 1986 and 1987, the authors followed the positive screenees to determine their final diagnosis. The authors obtained information on 85% of these persons, and found nine malignant melanomas, 91 non-melanoma skin cancers, 39 dysplastic nevi, and three congenital nevi. The sensitivity of the visual exam by a dermatologist was 89% to 97% and the predictive value positive was 35% to 75% for skin cancer. The authors conclude that the yield of screening is equivalent to that of other major cancer screening efforts and that the sensitivity and predictive value of the visual examination by the dermatologist is appropriate for a cancer screening tool.\r"

Early age at first sexual intercourse and increasing number of sexual partners were associated with significantly increased risks even after adjustment for their mutual effects. Risk increased to a twofold excess among women reporting first intercourse at 14 to 15 years of age compared with 20+ years. The number of steady sexual partners was a more important predictor of risk than the number of nonsteady partners, particularly before age 30, possibly reflecting the need for prolonged or repeated exposures to a transmissible agent, or different methods of protection against sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy. Reported frequency of intercourse was not generally associated with risk, except among women reporting increased frequencies before 20 years of age. Histories of gonorrhea or crab lice were associated with increased risk, but histories of other venereal diseases were not significant predictors. No consistently increased risks were detected for women reporting specific hygiene or douching habits, except the practice of washing the genitalia infrequently during menstruation. These results provide support for a period of increased susceptibility to carcinogens during adolescence, and suggest that this may be an important determinant of the high incidence of cervical cancer in Latin America.\r"

  ".W": "Heparinization during PTCA is often done empirically with an initial 10,000 unit bolus of heparin and subsequent additional boluses as deemed necessary to prevent thrombus formation and fibrin deposition. However, the initial 10,000 unit bolus may not result in adequate systemic anticoagulation in every patient, exposing some patients to risk of thrombus at the angioplasty site and subsequent reocclusion. In this non-randomized study, we assessed systemic coagulation during PTCA by retrospectively analyzing activated clotting times obtained in 108 consecutive patients. All patients had normal baseline prothrombin times and activated partial thromboplastin times. Patients who were on heparin prior to PTCA were excluded. Based on data from studies on heparinization during extracorporeal bypass an activated clotting time (ACT) of greater than 300 seconds was required. Twelve patients (11%) were observed to have activated clotting times of below 300 seconds after an initial 10,000 unit bolus of heparin. These patients required an additional 3,000-10,000 units of heparin to have systemic anticoagulation during PTCA. Symptoms of stable or unstable angina had no significant effect on heparin requirement, although there was a trend toward greater heparin resistance in unstable angina. We conclude that it is important to monitor the status of anticoagulation during PTCA, for 11% of patients undergoing PTCA require additional initial heparin bolus to achieve an ACT greater than 300 seconds and to be effectively anticoagulated. Careful monitoring of heparinization during PTCA may reduce the incidence of thrombosis.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to analyze the incidence, angiographic characteristics, and sequelae of side branch occlusion. Data from coronary angiograms of 4,800 consecutive patients from January 1981 to December 1987 was retrospectively analyzed, and 167 patients (3%) involving 181 lesions, with side branch occlusion, were identified. Only arteries with occlusion of side branches greater than 1 mm were evaluated. There were 65 (36%) diagonal, 49 (27%) septal, 40 (22%) left circumflex, and 27 (15%) right coronary branch occlusions. Most side branch occlusion occurred in branches with disease (66%: 120 of 181) or branches originating within the primary arterial lesion (72%: 130 of 181). Although the incidence of side branch occlusion is uncommon, it is associated with a significant incidence of myocardial infarction (14%). Attempts to reopen the occluded branch were successful in 27 of 36 cases (75%). With improvement in balloon angioplasty technology, the risks of side branch occlusion have declined, and many occlusions can be successfully reopened, suggesting that side branch involvement in a primary lesion is not a limitation to balloon angioplasty.\r"

Thallium-201 SPECT was analyzed quantitatively, and an ischemic score for the vascular bed(s) supplied by the dilated vessel(s) was derived. For the vessels dilated during the first procedure the mean diameter stenosis was 80 +/- 8%, reduced to 27 +/- 9%. For the second procedure mean stenosis was reduced from 67 +/- 10% to 26 +/- 6%. For the two procedures, the mean thallium scores decreased from 298 +/- 225 to 115 +/- 130 (P less than .001) and from 135 +/- 129 to 46 +/- 60 (P less than .001), respectively. Of 10 patients with abnormal thallium-201 SPECT prior to angioplasty, nine improved after the first procedure, and seven improved further following the second procedure. Thus, utilizing staged angioplasty with a strategy of dilating the most severe lesion first, thallium-201 SPECT documented progressive improvement in myocardial perfusion.\r"

Twenty-nine patients had stable angina, 59 had unstable angina, and 19 had had myocardial infarction (MI) 3 to 15 days prior to the procedure; 71 patients had single-vessel and 36 had multi-vessel disease. In this series, 57 lesions were defined as complex. Successful dilatation was defined as a residual stenosis of less than 30%. Of 132 non-total obstructions, 127 (97%) were successfully dilated. Two distal lesions could not be reached, two lesions could not be crossed by the balloon, and a distal lesion dilatation resulted in acute closure in one case. Of 19 total obstructions, 16 (84%) were successfully dilated (mean residual stenosis 23%). The wire tip was unable to cross the lesion in the three unsuccessful procedures. Seven complications occurred in the series, all involving non-total obstructions: closure of a distal vessel and a side branch caused no clinical symptoms or EKG changes; three local dissections were tacked back with repeat dilatation; and two longitudinal dissections caused no apparent reduction in luminal diameter. The Probe's low-profile and exceptional trackability enabled it to cross very tight lesions with minimal trauma to the vessel wall. The high degree of conformability of the PET balloon minimizes vessel straightening or sheer forces and appears to reduce the potential for dissection. The device may therefore extend the indications and ease of PTCA while reducing complications of the procedure.\r"

Three patients had coarctation of the aorta with a respective gradient of 24, 26, and 30 mm Hg; two were successfully treated by balloon angioplasty. The right-side hemodynamics were normal in all patients. Left ventricular pressures were elevated only in the patients with coarctation. The ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy revealed no evidence of rejection. The mean cardiac index was 4.7 liter/min/m2 (range, 3.68-5.9). These data indicate excellent hemodynamic results and support orthotopic heart transplantation as therapy for selected neonates and infants with incurable heart disease.\r"

Four hundred seventy-six anaesthetists from four regions (East, Quebec, Ontario and the West) (overall usable response rate of 73.3 per cent) responded to a series of questions on sources of liability information, changes in practice patterns over the past five years, changes in style of practice and attitudes towards the physician-patient relationship and to medical-legal concerns. The major findings were that the respondents rated liability concerns as the first or second most important reason for making major changes in their practice. Some of the changes in practice were related to increased use of monitoring, more time spent with patients discussing the risks of anaesthesia and increased documentation. On the negative side, respondents had decreased the administration of obstetrical and paediatric anaesthesia and were ordering more laboratory tests and x-rays. The majority of respondents agreed that the physician-patient relationship has suffered in recent years and physicians who had been in practice for longer periods of time were more likely to be dissatisfied and to consider leaving the field of medicine. However, the survey could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between claimed practice changes and fear of litigation.\r"

Two of the patients who died had received general anaesthetics and the other had intravenous sedation given by three different anaesthetists. All three patients arrested suddenly, developing profound cyanosis and electrical mechanical dissociation, underwent prolonged resuscitative efforts, and had marked hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Two other patients had signs of injection of air but survived, one suffering cardiac collapse and the other sustaining massive subcutaneous emphysema. Air embolism was produced by inadvertent injection of a mixture of air and water, passing through the hollow dental drill, directly into the mandible to the facial and pterygoid plexus veins and thence to the superior vena cava and right atrium.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in a control group of general surgical patients. Supramaximal train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve and the nerve to the masseter simultaneously. Jaw closure was measured by a force transducer system. In all patients, succinylcholine caused an increase in resting tone at the jaw and at the thumb. In the strabismus group, the magnitude of this increase was 55.7 +/- 23.2 g, mean +/- SD, at the jaw and 11.3 +/- 5.6 g at the thumb. This was not significantly different from the values obtained in controls, 45.3 +/- 33.4 g and 7.9 +/- 4.2 g, respectively. The duration of the phenomenon was 1-2 min in both muscles studied, and was not statistically different in the strabismus group. Time to complete neuromuscular blockade was significantly faster at the masseter, 31 +/- 6 sec--control groups; 39 +/- 11 sec--strabismus group, than at adductor pollicis, 61 +/- 34 sec--control groups; 75 +/- 28 sec--strabismus group (P less than 0.05 and 0.013 respectively). It is concluded that succinylcholine causes similar increases in jaw tension and comparable degrees of neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing strabismus surgery as in other children.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of the masseter to atracurium was measured in ten children aged 3-10 yr undergoing elective surgery, and compared with that of the adductor pollicis. During nitrous oxide-halothane anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation, supramaximal nerve stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve at the elbow and to the nerve to the masseter, at a point inferior to the zygomatic arch, anterior to the mandibular condyle. Jaw closure was measured by a force displacement transducer system attached to an oral airway and connected to a metal frame fixed to the operating table 10 cm caudad to the chin. Cumulative dose-response curves for atracurium were obtained by the injection of doses followed by an infusion to compensate for elimination. The mean ED50s and ED95s were similar at the masseter and the adductor pollicis. At the masseter, these were 0.150 +/- 0.013, mean +/- SEM, mg.kg-1 and 0.254 +/- 0.021 mg.kg-1, respectively. At the adductor pollicis, corresponding values were 0.145 +/- 0.009 mg.kg-1, and 0.259 +/- 0.016 mg.kg-1. However, this relationship was not constant in every patient, and in some patients the masseter was much more sensitive than the adductor pollicis. The time from injection of the first dose of atracurium to maximum blockade was 2.5 +/- 0.2 min at the masseter and 3.2 +/- 0.2 min at the adductor pollicis (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that when atracurium is administered to paediatric patients, neuromuscular blockade is usually of the same intensity at each muscle but occurs sooner at the masseter than at the adductor pollicis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The medical records and in vitro contracture test results of all patients over 15 years of age tested for MH because of previous MMR from 1985 to 1988 were reviewed. The number of children (age less than 16 yr) tested for MH because of previous MMR was also determined for the same four-year period, for comparison of coincidence rates. Six of 24 adult patients (25 per cent) were proved MH-susceptible by in vitro contracture testing. No clinical sign associated with the episode of MMR was predictive of MH-susceptibility. Two of six MH-susceptible patients developed acute MH following MMR. In the same four-year period, 75 children were tested for MH-susceptibility because of previous MMR; 44 (59 per cent) had a positive in vitro contracture test. We conclude that the coincidence of MMR and MH-susceptibility is lower in adults than children. Episodes of acute MH do occur after MMR, but the onset of MH may be delayed. Conservative management of MMR in adult patients is recommended.\r"

Twenty-eight patients with good ventricular function having CABG were divided into three groups and premedicated with morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 IM, scopolamine 0.005 mg.kg-1 IM and diazepam 0.1 mg.kg-1 PO. Group I patients received an infusion of 250 micrograms.kg-1 of alfentanil over one hour coincidental with a second infusion at 2.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 which was continued to the end of surgery. Patients in group II received 300 micrograms.kg-1 and 3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and patients in group III 350 micrograms.kg-1 and 3.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. The tracheas of all patients were intubated after receiving alfentanil 96 micrograms.kg-1 and pancuronium 0.15 micrograms.kg-1. Haemodynamic responses to intubation and surgical stimuli (greater than or equal to 20 per cent increase in heart rate and/or systolic blood pressure from control) were treated with isoflurane, one to two per cent inspired, until abolished. Blood samples were taken during and after surgery for plasma alfentanil concentrations which were determined by radioimmunoassay. After surgery the times to awakening and extubation, and alfentanil elimination half-life (t1/2B = 0.693/-k) were determined for each patient. Haemodynamic responses occurred in 20 patients. There were no significant differences in any variable among the groups. The times to awakening and extubation for all patients were 3.2 +/- 0.6 and 8.8 +/- 1.2 hr (mean +/- SEM) respectively.

Serum concentrations at varying doses were determined using a radioimmunoassay technique. It was found that serum concentrations for extradural, subdural and intraperitoneal fentanyl were similar at the low doses, but differed significantly at higher doses suggesting that pharmacokinetic differences may be concentration dependent. Extradural administration of naloxone (0.004 mg) was able to antagonize extradural fentanyl (8.0 micrograms), a dose eight-fold greater than the lowest maximally effective dose. The relationship between serum fentanyl concentrations and administered doses suggest that the analgesic properties of extradural and subdural fentanyl are in part dependent on centrally mediated actions.\r"

  ".U": "90106842\r", 
  ".W": "Several indices have been introduced as convenient alternatives to calculation of the physiological shunt fraction (Qs/QT) for the assessment of pulmonary gas exchange. These include: the arterial-alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2), the arterial oxygen tension-inspired oxygen concentration ratio (PaO2/FIO2), the respiratory index (RI), [A-a)DO2/PaO2) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference [A-a)Do2). These indices are in use clinically despite the fact that they may not accurately predict gas exchange in situations where FIO2, Qs/QT or arterial-venous oxygen content is changing. The clinical stability of each of these indices, relative to the behaviour of the physiological shunt, was therefore investigated prospectively in ten mechanically ventilated postoperative adults as FIO2 was varied from 0.30 to 1.00. None of the indices studied reliably reflected the behaviour of the physiological shunt. As FIO2 was increased incrementally from 0.30 to 1.00, 42 to 55 per cent of the measured changes in these indices were opposite in direction to the corresponding changes in the physiological shunt. The maximum magnitudes of the opposite changes were substantial; 24 and 22 per cent for the a/APO2 and PaO2/FIO2 ratio respectively, 67 per cent for the RI and 101 per cent for the (A-a)DO2. We conclude that the use of any of these indices for clinical assessment of a patient's gas exchange defect when FIO2 is varying can be substantially misleading.\r"

  ".W": "Calculated valve area depicts anatomical stenosis but does not quantify hemodynamic impairment. We propose that hemodynamic resistance, defined as the mean pressure gradient across the valve divided by mean flow rate during systolic ejection, gives a better indication of hemodynamic obstruction. This index was compared with Gorlin valve area in 40 patients with aortic stenosis. Calculated area ranged from 0.22 to 1.26 cm2, and mean transvalvular resistance ranged from 117 to 1,244 dyne.sec.cm-5. In general, resistance varied inversely with calculated area, but there was substantial variation about the mean relation. All of the variation could be accounted for by variations in the pressure gradients at each value of calculated area. Resistance was higher in proportion to area when flow and pressure gradient were high. Analysis of five published studies of a total of 83 valves showed that calculated area changed at least three times more than resistance when pressure gradient was varied. The utility of resistance as an index of stenosis is demonstrated by example calculations that show how during exercise a stenotic valve increases the ventricular work rate out of proportion to the work done on the peripheral resistance. These calculations are possible because hemodynamic resistance defines functional impairment in units commonly used for quantification of opposition to flow. Furthermore, resistance appears to be less dependent than area on conditions of measurement and does not require an empirical constant.\r"

Because volume measures are not currently possible in the embryonic heart, we tested the hypothesis that end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) ventricular perimeter, area, and conotruncal diameter correlate with ventricular mass and function in the stage 12 to stage 24 white Leghorn chick embryo. Video images of the contracting heart were recorded at 60 Hz on 1/2\" videotape and studied with a custom image-analysis workstation. ED and ES video fields were selected by maximum and minimum ventricular area and were planimetered for epicardial ventricular perimeter, area, and conotruncal diameter. Data are reported as (mean +/- SEM, n greater than or equal to 8) and were tested by analysis of variance and regression analysis. Heart rate calculated from cycle length increased from 78 +/- 6 beats/min at stage 12 to 162 +/- 5 beats/min at stage 24. ED and ES area increased geometrically versus stage (y = 0.53 - 0.08x + 0.004x2, r = 0.96, p less than 0.001; and y = 0.60 - 0.09x + 0.004x2, r = 0.98, p less than 0.001, respectively).

  ".W": "The passive electrical properties of subendocardial Purkinje fibers surviving in infarcted regions of canine ventricle 24 hours after coronary ligation were studied by using microelectrode techniques and cable theory. In normal hearts, cells within the subendocardial Purkinje fiber strands were found to be well coupled to each other but electrically isolated from neighboring myocardium. Voltage response to intracellular current injection was consistent with one-dimensional cable behavior and yielded estimates of passive electrical properties in general agreement with previous work on free-running Purkinje strands (membrane length constant, 1.2 +/- 0.1 mm; membrane time constant, 7.3 +/- 0.8 msec; input resistance, 67.4 +/- 7.4 K omega; membrane resistance, 8.2 +/- 0.7 K omega.cm; axial resistance, 0.52 +/- 0.06 M omega/cm; membrane capacitance, 960 +/- 102 nF/cm) (n = 21). On the day after coronary ligation, subendocardial Purkinje fiber action potentials were prolonged and slightly depolarized. Significant increases were measured in input resistance (+40.5%), membrane resistance (+43.9%), and axial resistance (+47.5%), whereas membrane capacitance was found to be significantly decreased (-24.3%) (n = 19). Conduction velocity, membrane length constant, membrane time constant, and the time constant and capacitance for the foot of the action potential remained unchanged. These results are consistent with electrical uncoupling between adjacent cells, which will increase internal resistivity, accompanied by changes in cellular phospholipid content, which can increase membrane resistance and alter membrane capacitance. Alternatively, the results can be explained by a simple model in which the apparent electrical structure is altered by changes in electrical coupling alone, with specific electrical properties remaining constant. Although the mechanisms underlying the observed changes remain uncertain, the present study indicates that myocardial infarction is associated with alterations in the passive electrical structure of surviving subendocardial Purkinje fibers, which, together with changes in action potential configuration, may provide a substrate for the generation of ventricular arrhythmias 24 hours after coronary ligation.\r"

Total ischemia at 37 degrees C was induced in beating hearts, potassium-arrested hearts, magnesium-arrested hearts, and hearts pretreated with 0.9 microM diltiazem to reduce but not abolish contractility. In the beating hearts, time-averaged [Cai], which is intermediate between the systolic and the basal [Cai], was 544 +/- 74 nM. In contrast, in the potassium- and magnesium-arrested hearts, the time-averaged values are lower than in beating hearts (352 +/- 88 nM for potassium arrest, 143 +/- 22 nM for magnesium arrest). During ischemia, ATP depletion, contracture, and a rise in [Cai] are delayed by cardiac arrest, but all occur more rapidly in the potassium-arrested hearts than in the magnesium-arrested hearts. The diltiazem-treated hearts were generally similar to the magnesium-arrested hearts in their response to ischemia. Under all conditions, contracture development was initiated after tissue ATP had fallen to less than 50% of control; invariably, there was a progressive rise in [Cai] during and following contracture development. Reperfusion with oxygenated perfusate shortly after peak contracture development resulted in a return of [Cai] to its preischemic level, resynthesis of creatine phosphate, no significant enzyme release, and no substantial loss of 5F-BAPTA from the heart. The data demonstrate that an increase in [Cai] precedes lethal myocardial ischemic injury. This rise in [Cai] may accelerate the depletion of cellular ATP and may directly contribute to the development of lethal ischemic cell injury.\r"

  ".W": "A premature action potential elicited in ventricular muscle during the functional refractory period of a preceding action potential requires an increased stimulus intensity for successful propagation. We measured the cellular basis for these relative decreases in tissue excitability during the recovery phase by performing parallel experiments on rabbit left papillary muscle and isolated rabbit ventricular cells in addition to conducting theoretical studies with numerical simulations of action potential initiation. For each experimental preparation, the pacing protocol consisted of a train of 10 stimuli (S1) at an S1-S1 interval of 500 msec with a premature stimulus (S2) of variable S1-S2 intervals following the tenth S1 action potential. The stimulus threshold for initiation of an S2 action potential (I2) was then measured as a function of the time of occurrence of the S2 stimulus relative to the time of 95% repolarization of the tenth S1 action potential (stimulus delay [SD] time). In the tissue preparation, the I2 increased sharply for SD times less than 0 msec to a value that was 100% above the S1 stimulus threshold for SD time = -5 +/- 2.4 msec (n = 8). Similar experiments on the isolated ventricular cell showed no increases in I2 as a function of SD time but rather significant decreases in both the action potential amplitude (APA) and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential upstroke (Vmax) of the S2 action potential. The APA and Vmax for the S2 action potential were decreased to 50% of the S1 action potential values for SD time = -5.2 +/- 2.1 msec and SD time = 0.3 +/- 1.6 msec, respectively (n = 8). Both parameters reached 100% recovery by SD time = 10 msec. These results and our numerical simulations are consistent with the hypothesis that the decreases in tissue excitability that occur with premature stimulation have a cellular mechanism as a result of a decrease in cellular responsiveness (APA, Vmax) rather than an intrinsic decrease in cellular excitability.\r"

  ".U": "90106912\r", 
  ".W": "In response to various stimuli, the pericardium produces prostaglandins that might play a role in neural regulation of cardiac electrophysiological properties by modulating epicardial nerve effects. We determined the effects of various epicardial superfusates on efferent cardiac responses, induced by bilateral efferent ansae subclaviae (SS) and cervical vagal (VS) stimulation, and afferent cardiac reflexes elicited by intracoronary injections of bradykinin (25 micrograms) and nicotine (50 micrograms). Pericardial instillation of arachidonic acid in normal Tyrode's solution (3 micrograms/ml) increased the concentration of pericardial prostacyclin (PGI2), measured by radioimmunoassay as the stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Arachidonic acid superfusion reduced SS-induced shortening of sinus cycle length (SCL), atrio-His interval (AH), and effective refractory period (ERP) of the right and left ventricular myocardium and prevented intra-aortic angiotensin II (30 ng/kg/min) from augmenting SS effects on these variables. Pericardial arachidonic acid plus indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) eliminated the prostaglandin increase and restored the responses of SCL, AH, and ERP to SS and to angiotensin II infusion. Pericardial PGE2 (30 or 50 ng/ml) or PGI2 (50 ng/ml) reversibly suppressed SS-induced shortening of SCL and ERP. Pericardial arachidonic acid or PGI2, however, did not blunt the shortening of ERP induced by intravenous infusion of norepinephrine. Pericardial arachidonic acid did not affect VS-induced lengthening of ERP or the duration of sinus arrest, or arterial blood pressure and heart rate responses to bradykinin or nicotine. We conclude that an increase in the concentration of prostaglandins in the pericardial fluid inhibits efferent sympathetic nerve effects on cardiac electrophysiological variables and antagonizes the facilitatory action of angiotensin II on efferent sympathetic stimulation by acting at presynaptic sites. Increased concentration of pericardial prostaglandins in response to various stimuli may constitute a physiological negative-feedback control mechanism that regulates efferent cardiac sympathetic stimulation.\r"

In addition, they prevent cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation, the hallmark of human atherosclerosis, in arteries of cholesterol-fed animals by cellular mechanisms that remain undefined. To assess whether CCBs enhance CE hydrolysis and reduce CE accumulation in human arterial cells, we measured activities of the CE metabolic cycle in aortic tissues that were stripped of endothelial cells and adventitia from 35 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients who were treated with either nifedipine or diltiazem (n = 23) for several months demonstrated a threefold increase in arterial CE hydrolytic activities compared with untreated patients. This difference was independent of serum cholesterol levels, age, or treatment with other medications. No effects were observed on CE synthetic activity. Cyclic AMP levels in the aortic tissue of patients treated with CCBs were also significantly elevated twofold to threefold. In addition, both free and esterified cholesterol were significantly reduced in aortic tissue from patients taking CCBs compared with untreated patients. These data are the first to show that CCBs can increase CE hydrolysis in human aortic tissue by increasing intracellular cyclic AMP with resultant decrease in CE accumulation. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that CCBs can act as antiatherosclerotic agents in human tissue by mobilizing stored CE in the arterial wall.\r"

  ".U": "90106916\r", 
  ".W": "Cells in many specimens of human ventricle can exhibit either of two stable levels of diastolic potential (DP) when exposed to 4 mM K+ in vitro (i.e., -78 +/- 4 mV or -45 +/- 5 mV, mean +/- SEM). In this report we show that the DP of some partially depolarized human ventricular cells developed a sustained 25-35 mV hyperpolarization (n = 28) when bath K+ concentration (K+b) was raised from 4 to 7 mM. On return of K+b to 4 mM, the DP of most, but not all, of these cells returned to the original depolarized levels. In other cells, the transition between the two levels of DP occurred at variable K+b ranging from 1 to 20 mM. We investigated the ionic mechanism(s) underlying the shifts between the two levels of potential by studying the K+ dependence of the DP in partially depolarized cells in 22 specimens of human ventricle. DP hyperpolarized an average of 25.6 mV (from -44.4 +/- 1.3 to -70.0 +/- 1.3 mV; n = 25) when K+b was increased from 4 to 7 mM. Intracellular K+ activity, determined by K+-selective microelectrodes, was within the range of normal reported for other mammalian species (106.7 +/- 4.4 mM in 4 mM K+; n = 22) and was unaffected by increasing K+b to 7 mM (111.7 +/- 6.6 mM; n = 6). Ba2+ (0.05 mM), a blocker of the inward rectifying K+ current, reversibly prevented the hyperpolarization, whereas acetylstrophanthidin (9 microM) failed to inhibit it. These results suggest that the hyperpolarization was due to a K+-dependent increase in K+ permeability and that electrogenic sodium pumping did not contribute significantly to the process. The ionic basis of the depolarization from a hyperpolarized level of DP also was investigated. Decreasing bath Na+ concentration and exposure to 30 microM tetrodotoxin did not prevent the depolarization. However, the depolarization could be inhibited by 2 mM Mn2+. These findings suggest that the depolarization may have been due to a Mn2+-sensitive inward current.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed in vitro on six normal thin ventricular epicardial tissue strips and 10 strips removed from the infarcted regions of dogs 21-60 days after experimental myocardial infarction. Conduction was evaluated by mapping activation sequences at 40-45 sites over an area of 1 x 2 cm during pacing at a basic cycle length of 2,000 msec. The amplitude and length of recorded electrograms were also determined at each site. After control recordings, heptanol, which increases gap junctional resistance, was added to the tissue bath at concentrations ranging between 0.2 and 1.0 mM. In contrast to its effect on normal tissues, heptanol caused 75 of 260 previously active sites in the infarcted tissues to become inactive. The affected sites were located in areas of very slow conduction and/or adjacent to areas of preexisting conduction block. In addition, heptanol decreased the length and degree of fractionation of electrograms recorded in slowly conducting regions of the infarcted tissues. The magnitude of the decrease in electrogram length following heptanol was related to the degree of electrogram abnormality during control as reflected in the ratio of electrogram length to amplitude. Heptanol shortened electrograms by causing local conduction block, which eliminated some components of the fractionated electrograms. In an additional eight epicardial strips removed from the infarcted region, 0.5 mM heptanol had only a slight effect (10.7% decrease) on the maximum rate of membrane depolarization. Thus, heptanol does not act primarily by way of depressing the fast inward current. We conclude from heptanol's effects on conduction and electrogram characteristics that slow and dissociated conduction in the infarcted region is due to an abnormality in gap junctional distribution between surviving cells and/or an abnormality in individual gap junctional function.\r"

Experiments were performed in open-chest rats. P(t) and Q(t) were measured during steady-state ejecting beats and during a beat in which the aorta was suddenly clamped. The degree of clamping varied from partial to total occlusion. The total occlusion beat was considered an isovolumic beat that generated an isovolumic pressure [Piso(t)] with a characteristic time to maximal Piso(t) [Tpisomax]. In ejecting beats, 34% of stroke volume was delivered after Tpisomax. P(t) and Q(t) from the steady-state ejecting beats and Piso(t) from the clamped beat were then used to estimate parameters of an E(t)-R model. Components of P(t) and Q(t) not accounted for by E(t)-R were identified and termed extra-pressure [Pext(t)] and extra-outflow [Qext(t)]. Pext(t) and Qext(t) were near-zero valued until Tpisomax; then they became systematically positive and finally negative valued after end ejection. During partial aortic occlusion, P(t) was elevated and Q(t) was reduced. However, the time of ejection was extended, and the fraction of stroke volume delivered after Tpisomax increased as P(t) was made higher. Partial occlusion also prolonged the positive phase of Pext(t) and Qext(t). Elements possessing \"active\" and \"deactive\" properties were added to the E(t)-R model in an attempt to account for Pext(t) and Qext(t) during partial occlusion. Optional forms of these elements were considered. These expanded E(t)-R models were fitted to basal ejecting data and then asked to predict data from a partial occlusion beat. All expanded models failed to adequately predict the partial occlusion pressure and/or outflow. It was concluded that 1) late ejection was quantitatively important to LV pumping, 2) behavior during late ejection was inconsistent with E(t)-R, and 3) ad hoc modification of E(t)-R models was not likely to yield LV pumping models that could satisfactorily reproduce instantaneous P(t) and Q(t) behavior over the entire ejection period.\r"

Fluorescent ratio images revealed discrete as well as clustered bright fluorescent spots (\"hot spots\"), which occupied approximately 20-50% of an individual cell's area. The fluorescent intensity and the area of the hot spots were increased by agents that deplete Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, namely, ryanodine (20-40 nM) and caffeine (5-15 mM). However, when cells were exposed to agents that deplete mitochondrial Ca2+, such as the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP, 100-300 nM), or the inhibitor of electron transport, antimycin A (4-40 nM), the fluorescent intensity and the area of the hot spots were reduced. These results indicate that the spatial distribution of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the ventricular myocytes of guinea pig is quite heterogeneous. The ability of CCCP and antimycin A, but not of caffeine and ryanodine, to reduce the fluorescent intensity in the hot spots implies that Ca2+ compartmentation in the mitochondria is largely responsible for the intracellular Ca2+ heterogeneity seen in the present study.\r"

Three active sites (I, II, and III) for PtdEtn N-methylation were assayed by measurement of [3H]methyl group incorporation from 0.055, 10, and 150 microM S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine into membrane PtdEtn molecules. Total methylation activity for catalytic site I of both sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum was stimulated within 2 minutes by isoproterenol in a dose-dependent manner. Although the increased methyltransferase activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum was normalized at 10 minutes, the enzyme activity in sarcolemma was normalized at 5 minutes but was again increased at 10-30 minutes after isoproterenol injection. No changes in response to isoproterenol were seen for site II and III N-methylation activities in either membrane. Individual N-methylated phospholipids (phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine), which specifically formed at each site, showed similar behavior. Pretreatment of the animals with a beta-blocking drug, atenolol, for 2 days prevented the isoproterenol-induced changes in hemodynamic parameters and sarcolemmal methylation without affecting the enhanced methylation activities in sarcoplasmic reticulum. In vitro addition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit) plus Mg-ATP enhanced methyltransferase activities in sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum from control hearts by 2.7- and 2.3-fold, respectively; however, under the same in vitro conditions, only about 20% activation was seen in both subcellular membranes isolated from the heart of isoproterenol-injected animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Residual stress has generally been ignored in published papers on left ventricular wall stress. To take residual stress into account in the analysis of stress distributions in a beating heart, one must first measure the residual strain in the no-load state of the heart. Residual strains in equatorial cross-sectional rings (2-3 mm thick) of five potassium-arrested rat left ventricles were measured. The effects of friction and external loading were reduced by submersing the specimen in fluid, and a hypothermic, hyperkalemic arresting solution containing nifedipine and EGTA was used to delay the onset of ischemic contracture. Stainless steel microspheres (60-100 microns) were lightly imbedded on the surface of the slices, and the coordinates of the microspheres were digitized from photographs taken before and after a radial cut was made through the left ventricular free wall. Two-dimensional strains computed from the deformation of a slice after one radial cut were defined as the residual strains in that slice. It was found that the distributions of the principal residual stretch ratios were asymmetric with respect to the radial cut: in areas where substantial transmural strain gradients existed, the distributions of strain components were different on the two sides of the radial cut. A second radial cut produced deformations significantly smaller than those produced from the first radial cut. Hence, a slice with one radial cut may be considered stress free.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The body surface potentials measured with 63 time-averaged unipolar leads were compared with epicardial and endocardial potential maps in six patients without and 10 patients with bundle-branch block. Intracardiac post-QRS activity, defined as extending beyond the thoracic QRS offset, was found in five of six patients without bundle-branch block (83%) and in five of 10 patients with bundle-branch block (50%), corresponding to 4 +/- 5% of the total number of electrograms in each patient. Fragmentation, double deflections, and single deflections were observed in 27%, 34%, and 39%, respectively, of these post-QRS electrograms. Post-QRS activation patterns that were stable from beat to beat showed slow propagation around or within areas of conduction block. Post-QRS activity was most often observed on both epicardial and endocardial surfaces (five of 10 patients). In the six patients without post-QRS activity, an area of late activity displaying low-amplitude deflections that were masked by the terminal activation of the normal myocardium was identified. Isopotential maps of the high-pass-filtered (55-Hz) thoracic and intracardiac signals demonstrated a close spatial correlation between the location, amplitude, and orientation of the potential extrema observed over the thoracic, epicardial, or endocardial surfaces during post-QRS activity. The thoracic patterns were generally dipolar with close extrema for anteroseptal or apical sites of post-QRS activity and more distant extrema for other sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With the inhalation of smoke, there are both cardiopulmonary changes and elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO). We hypothesize that these changes in cardiopulmonary function are the result of a histotoxic hypoxia associated with CO poisoning. This hypothesis was tested in chronically instrumented sheep (n = 19). Piezoelectric crystals were attached to the left ventricle for the measurement of its external minor and major diameters in addition to wall thickness. A pressure transducer was placed in the left ventricle via the apex. The caudal-mediastinal lymph node was also cannulated. After a five-day recovery period, six sheep (smoke group) were insufflated with four series of 16 breaths (700 ml/breath) of cotton smoke, and five sheep (control group) were insufflated with air using a modified bee smoker (smoke group: COHb, 90 +/- 6%; control group: COHb, 6 +/- 1%). Eight sheep (CO group) were ventilated with 2% CO in air to reach a COHb of 90% (COHb, 92 +/- 1%). In the smoke group, lung lymph flow reached 42 +/- 10 ml/hr at 24 hours after smoke insufflation (baseline, 6 +/- 1 ml/hr). The maximum elastance of the left ventricle (end-systolic pressure-volume ratio), a sensitive index of myocardial contractility, was significantly decreased from a baseline of 6.5 +/- 0.9 to 3.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg/ml. In the control and CO group, neither lung lymph flow nor maximum elastance varied from the baseline value. We conclude that the cardiopulmonary dysfunction after smoke inhalation does not occur after a similar exposure to CO. Initial CO poisoning alone is not a causative factor of cardiopulmonary dysfunction after smoke inhalation.\r"

Implants were studied by electron microscopy at intervals from 1 to 14 weeks in oculo. For comparison with myocardium developing in oculo, 12-day fetal tissue and 3-, 8-, and 28-day-old normally growing rats were also studied. At 1 week in oculo, myofibrils were laterally located and more frequent than in the 12-day fetus. Fibrils had clear Z bands and H bands, but no M bands. At 10 days in oculo (comparable to birth in normally growing animals), myocyte mitoses were present and tritiated thymidine autoradiography revealed many labeled myocyte nuclei. By 5 weeks in oculo, cells were filled with mature myofibrils with clear M bands and lateral connections between adjacent Z bands. However, myofibril bundles sometimes coursed at sharp angles to each other within single cells. Except for the relative lack of fibrillar polarization and small cell size, ultrastructure of myocytes developing in oculo for 5 or more weeks appeared very similar to myocytes developing in normally growing rats. By 10 weeks in oculo, when in situ growing hearts are clearly in a hypertrophic phase of growth, no mitoses or tritiated thymidine-labeled nuclei were present in myocytes, although labeled nonmyocyte nuclei were present. Morphometric evaluation revealed no change in myocyte diameter or nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio from 1 to 3 weeks in oculo, consistent with continued hyperplastic growth. Binucleated cells were present by 3 weeks in oculo and later, and the cytoplasm per nucleus increased fourfold between 3 and 5 weeks in oculo, suggesting conversion to hypertrophic cell growth. We concluded that cells proliferated and differentiated in the absence of a hemodynamic load, but that polarized alignment of myocytes and myofibrils was incomplete.\r"

In two placebo-controlled studies (the first, a single-dose, crossover study, and the second, a group comparative, multiple-dose study), concentration-effect curves for both agonists were constructed in whole blood by counting platelets electronically before and after dosing. Single oral doses of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg (four subjects) and 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg (four subjects) produced dose-related shifts to the right in U-46619 concentration-effect curves. The elimination half-life of GR32191 (up to 8 hours postdrug) was approximately 2 hours. Multiple dosing with GR32191, 17.5 mg (equivalent to 0.25 mg/kg for a 70 kg subject), three times daily (three subjects) or every 12 hours (six subjects), resulted in a cumulative inhibitory effect on U-46619 platelet aggregation in the apparent absence of a build-up of plasma concentrations of GR32191. Primary platelet aggregation induced by ADP was unaffected by GR32191. Multiple dosing had no effect on lancet bleeding time, and no drug-related changes were seen in routine laboratory hematologic and biochemical screens. GR32191 was well tolerated, although a subject with a history of drug-induced rectal bleeding reported the same symptom while taking GR32191.\r"

We have recently shown that chronic CyA treatment in normal rats is associated with a selective increase in renal thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis, which may play a role in GFR reduction. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of TXA2 activity could reduce CyA nephrotoxicity in a rat model of renal transplantation. To discriminate the possible biochemical changes due to rejection episodes from those due to CyA nephrotoxicity, we selected a model of renal isograft free of graft rejection processes. We demonstrated that oral CyA administration for 30 days to rats undergoing renal isograft is associated with the development of renal insufficiency, as indicated by a progressive increase in serum creatinine concentration and reduction in creatinine clearance. In the same animals, a parallel increase in the urinary excretion of TXB2 was found. Combination of the specific thromboxane receptor antagonist GR32191 with CyA treatment partially prevented the deterioration in renal function observed in animals given CyA alone, without modifying the urinary TXB2 excretion. In contrast, renal-isografted rats given GR32191 alone or vehicle alone for 30 days did not show any changes in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urinary TXB2 excretion throughout the experimental period. Mild hypercellularity of the glomerular tuft was observed in isografted kidneys chronically exposed to either CyA or CyA plus GR32191.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake, and the ratio of increase in oxygen uptake to work-rate increment were determined by ventilatory and gas exchange measurements as indexes for assessing the severity of heart failure. Anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen uptake declined with age, and males showed higher values than females in both indexes. Anaerobic threshold, as the percentage of predicted value for age, sex, and body weight, decreased as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class increased as follows: 90.2 +/- 15.4% in class I, 76.9 +/- 13.8% in class II, and 59.7 +/- 11.9% in class III (mean +/- SD). Although the ratio of increase in oxygen uptake to work-rate increment was not influenced by age or sex, it decreased as the severity of heart disease progressed. These results suggest that indexes from cardiopulmonary exercise testing are closely related to the pathophysiology of heart failure. We conclude that these indexes can be used as objective and reliable parameters for evaluation of the severity of heart failure in terms of functional capacity.\r"

Therefore, we assessed the difference between conventional methodologies using standard criteria to estimate the onset of anaerobiosis and compared them with known gas exchange and blood lactate [( La]) concentrations. Oxygen uptake (VO2) was determined at both the gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge) and the lactate threshold (LaT) using the following three types of commonly used methodologies in a blinded fashion: 1) conventional techniques based on manual inspection of plots of gas exchange indexes and [La] versus time, 2) computerized linear regression analysis of two-segment model plots for VCO2 versus VO2 and log [La] versus log VO2, and 3) fixed values determining the VO2 at a respiratory exchange ratio (VCO2/VO2) of 1.00 and at an [La] of 2 mmol/l. Respiratory exchange data were collected on a breath-by-breath basis in 30 men with documented myocardial infarction. Simultaneously, arterial blood was sampled for [La] every 20 seconds during maximal exercise on an upright bicycle ergometer programmed for a continuous ramp protocol of 15 W/min. The mean (+/- SD) peak VO2 was 1,463 (+/- 312) ml/min. The mean (+/- SD) VO2 values for each method were as follows: (table; see text) These results indicate that a good positive correlation exists between the gas exchange and lactate data by all three approaches. The chosen fixed values yield the highest threshold detection for both ATge and LaT. Detection was lowest using regression analysis for LaT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), the anaerobic threshold by gas exchange (ATge) represents a potentially useful parameter for assessing functional disability and the response to therapeutic interventions designed to improve exercise tolerance. We measured the ventilatory, hemodynamic, and metabolic responses to maximal bicycle exercise in 64 patients with CHF and 38 age-matched normal subjects. The ratio of ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2) was increased during exercise in patients as compared with normal subjects although VE was closely related to VCO2 in both individual normal subjects and patients (all, r greater than 0.92, p less than 0.01). Increased VE/VCO2 in patients was unrelated to increased pulmonary vascular pressures but was closely linked to increases in the pulmonary dead space to tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt). Despite hemodynamic abnormalities in patients, PaCO2 was regulated at normal levels during exercise. In a second study, we determined the ATge in 18 patients with CHF and 18 normal subjects by the ventilatory equivalents method. The ATge could be identified from unaveraged breath-by-breath data as the initial increase in VE/VO2 without an increase in the VE/VCO2 in 15 of 18 patients and in 16 of 18 normal subjects. The ATge demonstrated good day-to-day reproducibility (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001, SEE = 1.74 ml/kg/min) and low interobserver variability and was associated with comparable increases in arterial lactate in the two groups above the resting value, 0.9 +/- 0.4 mM/l in patients and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mM/l in normal subjects. To examine the effects of a chronic intervention on the ATge, 12 patients with CHF underwent exercise training for 4-6 months. Training resulted in a 23% improvement in peak VO2 and a decrease in blood lactate accumulation during submaximal exercise. This was associated with decreased VE and VCO2 during submaximal exercise, an increased VO2 at which the ATge occurred from 10.1 +/- 1.2 ml/kg/min to 12.1 +/- 2.6 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.01) and an increase in exercise duration during a symptom-limited, constant work-rate protocol (938 +/- 110 seconds vs. 1,421 +/- 691 seconds, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These have uniformly been trouble-free with acetabular reconstitution with minimal to no migration. In the massive allograft group (22 cases), the results have not been so spectacular, with only 55% good or excellent results. This is not necessarily a function of the acetabulum, since many of the femurs in this group also required allografting. No major migration has occurred, but the follow-up period is less than three years, and some migration is probably to be anticipated. It is concluded that, in these two situations, use of a bipolar prosthesis is a simple technique for dealing, at least in the short term, with a very difficult problem.\r"

The procedure was done when periacetabular bone loss precluded stable fixation of the revision component to bone. In addition, three of the operations were done for recurrent dislocation in patients with severe medical problems. Significant component migration occurred in one case, and one patient required reoperation for dislocation in the early postoperative period. Functional results in these 27 patients were quite satisfactory; bone grafts reliably became consolidated to the host pelvis.\r"

  ".W": "Bipolar hip arthroplasty was performed on 557 hips from December 1980 to June 1988. The clinical results and serial roentgenograms of 37 hips with acetabular deficiency, treated by arthroplasty from December 1980 to June 1983, were followed for a minimum of five years. The longest follow-up period was seven years and six months after the operation. The clinical score was assessed by the hip rating score of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association, which assigns a maximum of 100 points. The preoperative clinical score ranged from 24 to 56 points (mean, 42.2 points). The postoperative score improved to a range of 71-100 points (mean, 82.7 points). Of 37 hips examined, 31 hips were pain-free. As measured from the serial roentgenograms after the operation, the overall distance of central migration of the prosthesis in 37 hips was 0-5 mm, with an average of 1.4 mm, two years after the operation. At the five-year follow-up evaluation, 27 of 37 hips showed no additional central migration. The overall distance of superior migration of the prosthesis in 37 hips was from 0 to 8 mm, with an average of 2.6 mm, two years after the operation. Additional superior migration was noticed in 18 of 37 hips (48.6%) at the time of this five-year follow-up evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Although originally conceived as part of a two-stage procedure for the reconstruction of the deficient acetabulum, the use of a bipolar/grafting technique in selected patients can provide acceptable results as a definitive procedure. Critical technical considerations include proper preparation and grafting of the acetabular bed and careful sizing of the outer bipolar shell. Acceptable levels of pain relief and functional gain were obtained in 47 cases, with a follow-up mean Harris hip score of 86. Despite some initial socket migration in all hips, roentgenographic stability was gained after the first year. One acetabular failure was related to graft placement in the superolateral position. Bipolar reconstruction is indicated for contained acetabular defects only. In addition, the surgeon must have access to a complete inventory of socket sizes to ensure a proper fit and a bone bank to obtain adequate amounts of allogeneic bone.\r"

  ".W": "Complete posterior fracture-dislocation of the lumbar spine at L4-L5 level occurred in an 18-year-old male patient, who remained neurologically intact. The body of L4 with the vertebral column above was totally displaced behind the body of L5. The posterior elements of L5 were fractured and displaced posteriorly with L4, and this led to marked widening of the canal with spontaneous neurologic decompression. Open reduction and internal fixation with a sacral rod and two Harrington rods restored the anatomic relationship. In spite of the good reduction immediately obtained after surgery, two months later the fracture showed some redisplacement. The implants were removed, and a bone graft was transplanted for additional support. Seven months after trauma, the patient is asymptomatic and the spine is solidly fused. In spite of the risk of neurologic deterioration involved during surgery, open reduction and internal fixation were performed because they offered the best chance of healing, producing a biomechanically sound spine, and decreasing the risk of delayed neurologic deterioration. Because of the relatively wide neural canal at the lumbar level and the absence of spinal cord from the neural elements at the level of the injury, the risk of permanent neurologic deficit being produced during surgery was considered minimal.\r"

  ".W": "Chymopapain in the treatment of sciatica by chemonucleolysis has become widespread in the United States and Europe since the approval of this drug for general use by the Food and Drug Administration. Potentially, the increased use of this drug by surgeons with relatively little experience could be expected to cause an increase in the complication rate. This report analyzes the results of a questionnaire sent to surgeons in 316 departments who have recently treated a total of 43,662 patients with this technique. The complication rate was 3.7% (1606 incidents). Of these, 192 (0.45%) were severe. The study revealed that the frequency of severe allergic reactions is lower in Europe than in the United States. Twice the number of anaphylactic reactions occurred with local and neuroleptic anesthesia compared to local or general anesthesia alone. The risk of infectious discitis is low, but a strict sterile technique is mandatory. Neurologic complications were rare, but included 15 cauda equina, one meningeal hemorrhage, a case of epilepsy, and two cases of paraplegia. The rate of complications in this study is comparable to two previous studies; thus, the expected increase in complications has not occurred. For comparison, a survey of 2051 patients treated surgically showed a complication rate of 26% (534 incidents), including 86 (4.2%) severe complications. Among the surgically treated patients, there was a perioperative complication rate of 9.75% (200 incidents) and a postoperative complication rate of 14% (290 incidents), resulting in three deaths. Thus, the surgical treatment was responsible for six times the number of incidents and ten times more severe incidents than for patients treated by nucleolysis.\r"

Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing consisted of several sensory threshold measurements obtained by the application of force-calibrated Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments to each digit in the hand with the wrist in neutral position. The quantitative provocational diagnostic test employed Semmes-Weinstein measurements obtained with the wrist both in the neutral and flexed positions. The sensitivity (82%) and specificity (86%) of the combined test were calculated. It was more sensitive and specific than the wrist flexion test alone and more specific than the Semmes-Weinstein sensibility test. The combined test is recommended as the most accurate and sensitive quantitative clinical test for median nerve compression evaluated by the authors to date.\r"

A rare tendon interposition of extensor carpi ulnaris occurred in an 11-year-old boy. The isolated displaced distal ulnar physeal injury was the result of a motor vehicle accident. Attempts to perform a closed reduction failed. At operation, an interposed extensor carpi ulnaris tendon was found. After repositioning the tendon, a near anatomic reduction was easily accomplished. Only two cases seem to have been reported in the literature on the need for open reduction of distal ulnar physeal injury, none with an interposed tendon. Interposed extensor carpi ulnaris tendon should be considered as a cause of irreducible displaced distal ulna epiphyseal fracture.\r"

Internal and external rotation were measured with the subject lying prone with flexed knees. Presence of in-toeing gait was noted. A significant reduction of internal rotation with age was found in both females and males. In all age groups, females had significantly higher range of internal rotation than males. External rotation did not show the same age and gender dependency. Sixteen percent of all subjects had an in-toeing gait. The frequency decreased from 30% in the four-year-old group to 4% in adults. The subjects with in-toeing had a significantly increased internal rotation and decreased external rotation.\r"
