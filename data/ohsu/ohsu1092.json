This methodology computes a fast, near optimal fit between a three-dimensional skull surface mesh and a two-dimensional digitized facial photograph. Since this is done digitally, (1) the photograph can be enhanced to reduce or eliminate motion blur, overexposure or underexposure, and out-of-focus distortions; (2) previous problems with skull/photograph scaling and alignment are minimized or eliminated; and (3) the photograph and skull can be numerically correlated. Two of several test cases produced from an implementation of this methodology are also presented.\r"

This sample included many adolescents and could be used to expand Phenice's 1969 study, which was largely based on mature adults. In the present study, focus was placed on the ventral arc which, when used alone, provided 96% accuracy in sex determination. This paper stresses the development of the ventral arc in the adolescent: a precursor condition is defined, which first appears at age 14 and becomes the most frequent condition at age 20. In mature adults, 4% show conditions that are misleading and likely to lead to sex determination errors. Practical applications of this method are discussed in relation to the forensic science setting, including three cases. A set of casts was developed to increase the reliability of the method, and these casts were then tested in interobserver error studies.\r"

Enzyme immunoassay with goat anti-HP antiserum and rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin peroxidase were used to identify the HP bands from the extracted samples. Enzyme immunoassay was found to be clearly more sensitive than o-dianisidine or o-tolidine in detecting HP bands from diluted serum samples.

Although controls had cancers of the same sites as those of cases and thus, strongly tobacco and alcohol-related, there were marked residual effects for these two risks factors.

First, interviewer-derived counts of nevi on the arm produced estimates of inter-observer, inter-subject, temporal and random variability, and their interactions. Second, interviewer-derived arm counts and respondent self-reports of whole body nevus density were compared. Finally, we compared male and female cases and controls with respect to their reported rates of having a relative with a malignant mole. Overall, the intra-observer reliability ranged from 55 to 81%, and was better for observers with more experience. The correlation between the interviewer counts and respondents' self-reported estimates was 0.41. The data on malignant moles in relatives suggest higher reporting rates in male cases and lower reporting in male controls relative to their female counterparts, but there is little difference by sex in the reporting of one's own nevus density.\r"

The prevalence rate for males increased with age, while that for females tended to decrease.

Probabilities were obtained from the obstetric and genetic literature, and utilities from previously published standard reference gambles and from responses of obstetric residents and students recorded on a linear rating scale. The expected utility of amniocentesis exceeded that of chorionic villus sampling by 0.1 utility units, and of no prenatal testing by 0.12 utility units. The decision was insensitive to clinically plausible values for the probabilities of spontaneous abortion after amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, the probabilities of abnormal and indeterminate chorionic villus sampling results, the probability of an abnormal amniocentesis result after an indeterminate chorionic villus sampling, the sensitivities and specificities of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, and the probabilities of significant maternal morbidity after first- and second-trimester therapeutic abortion. Chorionic villus sampling was preferred to amniocentesis when the utility of a first-trimester therapeutic abortion exceeded that of a second-trimester abortion by 23.2 utility units, or when the anxiety \"cost\" of awaiting second-trimester amniocentesis results exceeded 0.1 utility unit. We conclude that over a range of assumptions concerning the probabilities involved in the prenatal testing decision, amniocentesis was preferred to chorionic villus sampling. However, for a decision maker for whom a second-trimester therapeutic abortion would be significantly less acceptable than a first-trimester procedure, or for whom the anxiety of awaiting second-trimester chromosomal diagnosis might be an important consideration, chorionic villus sampling could become the procedure of choice.\r"

In cross-study comparisons, certain research design characteristics (e.g. time of day of blood sampling) and various sample characteristics (e.g. volunteers vs patients as subjects) were related to both mean testosterone level and the slope of the age-testosterone relation. For example, for subgroups of subjects that did not exclude ill men, the mean testosterone levels were low, and did not decline with age. Subgroups that included only healthy subjects, in contrast, had higher overall testosterone levels and showed a decline of testosterone with age. Implications of these results for design, analysis and reporting of future epidemiologic studies will be discussed. These results also illustrate the utility of meta-analysis for research with the aged.\r"

The first phase of the program was implemented in 11 communities in the western United States. This paper describes the evaluation design of the CHPGP in the West, the methods of data collection, and the baseline comparability of intervention and control communities. Major features of the evaluation design include: (1) the randomization of qualified communities making application into funded and unfunded comparison groups; (2) a second set of matched control communities for some intervention sites; (3) data gathering through repeated surveys of community residents (probability samples of adults and adolescents) and institutions (health-related organizations and randomly sampled grocery stores and restaurants); and (4) the use of secondary data to monitor health events. Selected baseline data show that intervention and control communities differ in racial/ethnic composition, but relevant health behaviors and ratings of community activation for health promotion appear comparable.\r"

  ".U": "91294817\r", 
  ".W": "The growing interest in community-based approaches to health promotion and disease prevention (HP/DP) has been accompanied by a growing need to evaluate the effectiveness of such programs. Special issues that arise in these evaluation studies include (1) entire communities are assigned to intervention and control groups, (2) only a small number of communities can usually be studied, (3) the time course of changes in behavior and other outcomes is often of interest, and (4) surveys to measure such changes over time can be conducted with either repeated cross-sectional samples or with longitudinal samples. This paper shows how these issues can be addressed under a mixed-model analysis of variance approach. This approach serves to unify several ideas in the literature on evaluation of community studies, including use of time-series regression and the question of whether the individual or the community should be the unit of analysis. We also describe how the method can be used to estimate sample size requirements, statistical power, or minimum detectable program effect.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between colon cancer risk and the relative contributions of fat and caloric intake are assessed. A lack of consensus exists regarding the role of each of these dietary factors in the development of colon cancer. This lack of agreement originates from the high correlations between the nutrients, as well as the manner in which researchers treat these dietary variables in their analyses. Four proposed methods are evaluated which attempt to address the collinearity problem in nutritional epidemiology: (1) exclude one or more collinear variables, (2) use the proportion of calories consumed attributable to each dietary component, (3) use a regression-adjustment approach to purge the collinearity correlated nutrients, and (4) ridge regression. Diagnostic tests are reported which assess the degree of collinearity on data collected for a case-control study of colon cancer conducted in Utah between 1979 and 1983. Using logistic regression analyses, we apply each of these methods to case-control data. We find that the risks associated with fat and caloric consumption are extremely sensitive to a priori analytic decisions made by epidemiologist about the underlying collinearity problem.\r"

B symptoms were observed in 13 patients. Peripheral adenopathy was present in 26 patients, while mediastinal adenopathy occurred in five. There was extranodal disease in 13 patients; the most common extranodal site was skin with seven affected. Seventeen patients had stage III/IV disease. Immunophenotypes were T cell in 24 patients and B cell in four patients; immunophenotype could not be determined in three patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities in chromosomes 2, 5, and 7 were detected in three patients. Although therapy was heterogeneous, the actuarial 2-year survival was 73%. Two-year disease-free survival was 39% for all patients; for stages I and II, it was 62% compared with 20% for stages III and IV (P = .001). Complete remission (CR) occurred in 21 of 23 patients receiving combination chemotherapy; however, nine relapses, including six of seven stage IV patients, occurred within 21 months of diagnosis. Preliminary observations suggest that Ki-1 ALCL may have a quiescent phase in the rare patient with only localized skin disease. However, the disease generally behaves as an intermediate- to high-grade lymphoma, and patients with Ki-1 ALCL should receive curative-intent combination chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were infused with 6.2 to 58.2 mCi (0.2 to 3.9 mg) doses of radioactive iodine (131I)-labeled LL2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) or F(ab')2, in order to study antibody distribution, pharmacokinetics, dosimetry, toxicity, tumor targeting, and therapy. LL2 is a murine IgG2a monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactive with B cells and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. In a series of five assessable therapy patients, doses as small as 30 mCi 131I-LL2 IgG or F(ab')2 resulted in tumor responses (two partial remissions, two mixed and minor responses, and one no response), while one patient receiving diagnostic doses as low as 6.2 mCi showed a partial remission for 1 year and a complete remission after a second low radiation dose. No acute toxicities were noted, and only myelotoxicity accompanied therapeutic doses, with grade IV marrow toxicity seen in three of seven patients receiving total doses of about 50 mCi. Dosimetry calculations showed spleen and tumor dose rules of about 4.6 cGy/mCi, which was three to four times the dose to other organs. Despite the administration of relatively low doses of LL2 (0.2 to 3.9 mg), 82% of 60 known extrasplenic lymphoma sites were imaged. Serum clearance showed an average distribution half-life (T1/2) of 2.1 hours and an elimination T1/2 of 32.0 hours. The average total-body clearance T1/2 was 43 to 45 hours. LL2's antigenic target does not appear to be shed in high amounts into the circulation. Three of eight patients having at least two injections showed a human antimouse antibody response. These patients may have been presensitized to animal protein. An interesting observation in this study was the marked drop in circulating B lymphocytes after the administration of radioiodinated LL2 or anticarcinoembryonic antigen MAbs, suggesting that this is a nonspecific radiation effect and not necessarily related to the binding of MAb to normal B cells.\r"

Included were 25 with the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, three with Hodgkin's disease, eight with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and one with unknown subtype, of whom 31 were considered eligible. The majority had failed at least two, but no more, conventional chemotherapy regimens. Ten (32%) of the eligible patients had a partial response (PR), including patients with nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic (NPDL), nodular mixed (NM), diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic (DPDL), or diffuse histiocytic (DH), lymphoma mixed-cellularity (MC), Hodgkin's disease, and unknown subtype, and in four patients with CTCL. The overall median time to treatment failure (TTF) was only 1.3 months, but the range extended to 57.3 months. The overall response duration was 16.0 months, and the range extended to 53.4 months. Overall median survival was 2.7 months, with the range extending to 63.2 months. The majority of patients had no toxicity, but there were some instances of severe or life-threatening events. Four fatal toxicities occurred, in two patients with underlying pulmonary conditions and two with prior cardiac histories. From this study, we conclude that dCF is active in refractory lymphomas and CTCLs, should be avoided in patients with a history of serious pulmonary or cardiac diseases, and warrants consideration for incorporation of a low-dosage schedule into conventional combination chemotherapy regimens, including its use with biologic response modifiers.\r"

  ".W": "In June 1984, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) initiated a pilot study (8498) using high-dose cytarabine (HdA; 3 g/m2) for intensification of early therapy in childhood acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (group I). Remission induction therapy consisted of two courses of daunorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C), and thioguanine (DAT). Postremission therapy consisted of four sequential courses, each consisting of (1) four doses of HdA (HdA4) followed by asparaginase (L-Asp), (2) etoposide (VP) plus azacytidine (Az), (3) prednisone, vincristine, methotrexate, and mercaptopurine (POMP), and (4) Ara-C daily for 5 days by continuous infusion. Six doses of intrathecal Ara-C were given for CNS prophylaxis. In December 1986, the protocol was amended (group II) to substitute six doses of HdA (HdA6) for the second DAT (two + five) induction course; postinduction, a single course of HdA6 was given instead of four HdA/L-Asp courses, and the remainder of the therapy was unchanged. One hundred forty group I patients and 145 group II patients were assessable. The two groups were similar with regard to clinical prognostic groups. No significant differences were noted in the two groups with regard to remission induction (85% [SE = 2%] in each group), induction deaths (6.5% v 7.0%), or deaths in remission (one in each group). Cerebellar toxicity was reported in three patients in group II (with HdA6) but none in group I (HdA4). At present, patients who received HdA6 (group II) had higher event-free survival than patients in group I (EFS at 3 years, 34% [SE = 11%] v 29% [SE = 4%]), and disease-free survival (DFS at 3 years, 42% [SE = 14%] v 34% [SE = 4%]), but the differences were not statistically significant. In both groups, children less than 2 years and those with WBCs less than 100,000/microL had significantly better outcome (EFS of 55% [SE = 10%] and 36% [SE = 5%] at 3 years, respectively) than children greater than or equal to 2 years and those with WBCs greater than or equal to 100,000/microL (EFS of 27% [SE = 5%] and 20% [SE = 9%] at 3 years, respectively.\r"

Diploid tumor stem lines were identified in 101 patients (34%), clonal hyperdiploid abnormalities in 194 (65%), and hypodiploid stem lines in three (1%). In children with widely disseminated tumors at diagnosis (stage D), ploidy had a highly age-dependent influence on prognosis. Among infants (less than 12 months) treated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, hyperdiploidy was closely associated with long-term disease-free survival (greater than 90% of cases), while diploidy invariably predicted early treatment failure (P less than .001). Similarly, in children 12 to 24 months of age who were treated with cisplatin-teniposide and cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, diploidy uniformly predicted early failure, whereas half of the children with hyperdiploidy achieved long-term disease-free survival (P less than .001). There was no relationship between ploidy and treatment outcome in children older than 24 months with stage D tumors who had a very low probability of long-term disease-free survival (less than 10%). N-myc gene amplification was detected in 37 (25%) of the 147 tumors tested, with the remainder showing single-copy levels of the gene. N-myc gene amplification was more frequent in diploid than in hyperdiploid tumors (23 of 57 v 14 of 87, P = .001) and predicted a high likelihood of early treatment failure. In children younger than 2 years with disseminated neuroblastoma, tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene copy number provide complementary prognostic information that will distinguish patients who can be cured on current regimens from those who require new treatment strategies.\r"

To quantify these late effects we interviewed 342 adults (or their proxies) who had CNS tumors diagnosed before the age of 20 between 1945 and 1974, survived at least 5 years, and reached 21 years of age. Survivors were 32 years old on average at follow-up. When compared with 479 matched siblings as controls. CNS tumor survivors were more likely to have died or to have become mentally incompetent sometime during the follow-up period. They were more likely to be at risk for such adverse outcomes as unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6 to 25.7], to have a health condition that affected their ability to work (OR, 5.9; CI, 3.7 to 9.4), to be unable to drive (OR, 28.8; CI, 6.9 to 119.9), or to describe their current health as poor (OR, 7.8; CI, 1.7 to 35.7). Unfavorable outcomes were more frequent in male survivors than in females, in those with supratentorial tumors compared with infratentorial ones, and in those who received radiation therapy. As clinicians consider improving therapies, they should anticipate late effects, such as those we observed, and attempt to target subgroups for interventions that may improve subsequent quality of life.\r"

However, patients relapsing after treatment with surgery alone experienced a significantly longer interval to further disease progression (P less than .01) and improved survival after relapse (P = .01) when compared with patients who relapsed after treatment with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy.

  ".U": "91294830\r", 
  ".W": "To test whether alternating chemotherapy is a favorable treatment modality in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), 334 patients were randomized to receive either fixed cyclic-alternating treatment with ifosfamide/etoposide (IE), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV), or response-oriented treatment with IE therapy up to maximal response and subsequently an immediate switch to CAV. In both arms, six cycles were given in 3-week intervals. After chemotherapy, patients with limited-stage disease received chest irradiation with 45 Gy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation with 30 Gy was applied to all complete responders. No maintenance therapy was given to patients with complete response. Minimum follow-up was 2 years. Of 321 assessable patients, the overall response rate was 70% for cyclic alternating and 77% for response-oriented treatment. Complete remission (CR) rates were 26% versus 26%. The median survival times were 9.7 months for cyclic-alternating versus 10.7 months for response-oriented treatment; the 2-year survival rates were 11% versus 9%. In limited-stage disease (LD) patients, there was a median survival of 12.5 months versus 12.3 months and a 2-year survival rate of 21% versus 18%. In extensive-stage disease (ED) patients, median survival was 8.5 versus 9.1 months, and the 2-year survival rate 3% versus 4%. From these results, we conclude that the cyclic-alternating treatment according to the hypothesis of Goldie et al has no advantage in comparison to a sequential treatment strategy with an immediate switch to a second-line protocol at the time no further response to first-line therapy is seen. Our major aim in the treatment of SCLC is to administer an active regimen at any time during the course of treatment regardless of whether sequential or alternating therapy is used.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma were enrolled in this study. Ten patients had received prior chemotherapy that included the combination of fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV). All patients required subcutaneous port insertion and portable external infusion pumps to allow outpatient treatment. 5-FU (2,600 mg/m2) was administered concurrently with LV (500 mg/m2) over 24 hours of continuous infusion. The mean steady-state plasma concentration of 5-FU was 10 mumol/L (range, 7 to 14 mumol/L). The 5-FU dose was based on our previous phase I study, in which maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of 5-FU was determined to be 2,600 mg/m2 in combination with a fixed dose of LV at 500 mg/m2. The treatment was repeated weekly. Twenty-two patients received a total of 560 courses of treatment. Eleven instances of grade 2-3 toxicity were observed: diarrhea (five), stomatitis (three), hand/foot syndrome (three). The overall objective response was 45% (10 of 22) and among previously untreated patients was 58%. Three of the responders achieved complete response (CR), with lung and liver as the metastatic sites. The median duration of survival for the previously untreated patients was not reached at 22 months, and was 10 months for the previously treated patients. These results suggest that short-term infusional therapy of 5-FU and LV in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer generates acceptable toxicity, with equivalent or superior survivability in previously treated and untreated patients versus alternative methods of administration of the two agents.\r"

  ".U": "91294832\r", 
  ".W": "A murine monoclonal antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was labeled with indium-111 (111In) by means of a benzylisothiocyanate derivative of diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) and used for clinical radioimmunodetection studies. Twenty-one patients having a history of surgically resected colorectal cancer and rising serum CEA levels suggestive of tumor recurrence were studied. Patients were infused over 20 minutes with 5, 10, or 20 mg of the monoclonal antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In. The mean radiochemical purity was greater than 96%. No toxicity was seen. The stability of the radiolabel on antibody in patient serum was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with autoradiography, and immunoprecipitation for up to 96 hours after infusion. Tumor sites were identified in 20 of 21 patients. Sites of antibody accumulation in 20 patients were confirmed as tumor either by resection at laparotomy (16 patients) or fine-needle biopsy (four patients). Nine patients who had the identified lesion resected or irradiated showed return of the serum CEA antigen level to normal or near normal values. In the absence of high levels of circulating CEA (greater than 500 ng/mL), the disappearance of radioactivity from patient serum demonstrated first order elimination kinetics, with a mean half-life of 38 hours. The serum half-life was not affected by the dose of antibody administered or by serum CEA titers below 500 ng/mL. Despite a mean liver uptake of 18% injected dose (ID) 24 hours after administration, hepatic metastases were easily visualized as areas of increased uptake of radioactivity. Radioimmunodetection of recurrent colorectal cancer, not detected by computed tomographic (CT) scans, appears achievable with this agent. This may allow successful clinical intervention in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in a phase II study with an intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) of interleukin-2 (IL2) given with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. The dose of IL2 was the optimal priming dose for LAK-cell induction, followed by the maximally tolerated LAK-cell dose that could be given by an IVCI schedule as determined by a previous phase I trial. The CI schedule was chosen for evaluation because of a postulated reduction in toxicity with the possibility of administering a more prolonged IL2 infusion and because greater rebound lymphocytosis and LAK-cell generation had been reported using this dose and schedule. The 33 patients were similar in age, performance status, and sites of disease to those treated in previous IL2 trials. All patients were assessable for response and toxicity. One patient (3%) achieved a partial response of 10 months duration. There were no other clinically significant responses. Significant toxicity included hypotension requiring pressors (45%), dyspnea (36%), renal insufficiency (24%), hepatic dysfunction (66%), and cardiac arrhythmias (18%). These toxicities reversed with cessation of the infusion. There were four deaths during the first 30 days of treatment, three from infection (one related to central line, one related to LAK cells, one related to tumor), and one from tumor-related hemorrhage. Toxicity was unexpectedly high and at least comparable to that seen in previous studies using a high-dose IV bolus schedule of IL2. When comparing the IVCI schedule with high-dose bolus IL2 to LAK cells in nonrandomized but sequential studies in patients with advanced melanoma, it appears that CI IL2 is less efficacious.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a phase II study of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16) as salvage therapy in patients with ovarian cancer who had persistent disease or who had relapsed after primary systemic chemotherapy and had residual disease of less than 2 cm. Two hundred eleven courses of IP chemotherapy consisting of CDDP 200 mg/m2 and VP-16 350 mg/m2 were administered. All patients received intravenous (IV) thiosulfate protection. Treatment was given once every 4 weeks for a median of six cycles. Twenty-four of 37 assessable patients were clinically free of disease at the end of treatment (normal physical exam, computed tomographic [CT] scan, CA-125 and peritoneal cytology); one patient had a partial response. Ten of these 24 patients consented to reexploration at the end of treatment, and nine were in pathologic complete remission, while one patient had positive peritoneal washings as her only evidence of persistent disease. The median survival of the 37 patients was 26 months from the first day of IP treatment and 51 months from diagnosis. The major toxicity was myelosuppression, with median nadir WBC, granulocyte, and platelet counts of 2,400, 684, and 134,000/mm3, respectively. There was no cumulative renal damage, hypomagnesemia, or chemical peritonitis. We conclude that IP CDDP and VP-16 can produce pathologic complete remissions when used as a second-line regimen for patients with ovarian cancer who have received systemic cisplatin-based therapy and have less than 2 cm disease.\r"

To administer equitoxic doses at each cycle, the drug dosages were adjusted according to the hematologic toxicities experienced after the previous course; 44.7% of CAC and 21.1% of PAC patients required a dosage reduction at the second course (P = .002). Neither CAC nor PAC caused any clinically relevant neuro-nephrotoxicity; however, CDDP was administered with hydration and forced diuresis, while carboplatin was administered by rapid intravenous (IV) infusion. After six cycles, response rates were superimposable: 62.5% and 66.6% for CAC and PAC, respectively; pathologic complete responses (pCRs) were 16.7% for CAC and 23.2% for PAC; among patients with more than 2 cm residual disease, PAC induced more pCRs than CAC (eight of 52 or 15.4% v one of 42 or 2.4%, P = .07). Median survivals and progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 22.6 and 13.2 months for PAC, and 23.1 and 15.5 months for CAC, respectively; these differences are not significant. In conclusion, this trial demonstrates that equitoxic doses of PAC or CAC result in a similar response rate, PFS, and survival.\r"

Hematologic toxicity was significantly higher with PE, and gastrointestinal side effects were frequent with this treatment. This study demonstrated that the PE combination is effective as front-line chemotherapy. As far as response rate is concerned, a trend of superiority over CMF was observed, which was of borderline significance. Due to the lack of survival advantage and to toxicity, this combination is not recommended for routine clinical use. However, its high level of activity should be taken into account for further research.\r"

The CSF pharmacokinetics of MTX with and without CPDG2 rescue was studied in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) using a nontoxic IT 5 mg dose (equivalent to 50 mg in humans). Without CPDG2 rescue, peak CSF MTX concentration was 2,904 +/- 340 mumol/L. Within 5 minutes of administration of 30 U IT CPDG2, CSF MTX concentrations decreased greater than 400-fold to 6.55 +/- 6.7 microM. Subsequently, groups of three monkeys received either 25 mg IT MTX (equivalent to 250 mg in humans) followed by 150 U IT CPDG2 or 50 mg IT MTX (equivalent to 500 mg in humans) followed by 300 U IT CPDG2. All animals survived without neurotoxicity. Our studies suggest that CPDG2 may prove to be an important addition to the currently recommended strategy for the management of IT MTX overdose.\r"

One hundred two chemotherapy-naive patients (44 women and 58 men) scheduled to receive CDDP chemotherapy at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2 entered the study. Eighty-nine patients completed both cycles with the following results: complete protection from emesis/nausea was obtained in 57/59 patients (64.0%/66.3%) with OND and in 81/79 (91.0%/88.8%) with OND plus DEX (P = .0005/P = .0021). At the end of the study, 53% of the patients expressed a treatment preference, and of these, 74% chose OND plus DEX compared with 26% who preferred OND alone, a statistically significant difference (P less than .003). Side effects were very mild and not significantly different between the two treatments. We conclude that OND plus DEX is more efficacious than OND in protecting patients from CDDP-induced emesis and nausea.\r"

In the past decade, neurotoxicity has been an increasingly recognized cytarabine effect. Intrathecal (IT) cytarabine may result in myelopathy that is incompletely reversible. Combined IT drug and cranial irradiation may lead to necrotizing leukoencephalopathy. Intravenous (IV) therapy may cause a peripheral neuropathy that varies greatly in its severity. The high IV cytarabine doses now commonly used can cause seizures, cerebral dysfunction, or an acute cerebellar syndrome with an incidence up to 14%. Patient age (greater than 60 years) appears to be the most important risk factor, but drug dose/schedule, cumulative drug dose, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant use of neurotropic antiemetic agents may also influence the risk of neurotoxicity. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of such cytarabine-induced neuronal injury will allow this drug to be used with greater efficacy and safety.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the ability of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to support the proliferation and activation of numerous types of immunocompetent cells and to support the survival of adoptively transferred lymphocytes, there has been considerable interest in its use in the immunotherapy of malignancies. While studies to date have indicated that IL-2 has activity against some malignancies, considerable toxicity has also been observed. Careful prescreening and selection of patients and appropriate management of toxicity can minimize adverse outcomes. Studies of IL-2 effects have provided intriguing evidence of interactions of the immune/cytokine system with the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and other systems. Studies in animal models have demonstrated the central role of an intact immune system in mediating many toxicities of IL-2. Several adverse effects of IL-2 appear to be mediated by other cytokines whose production is induced by IL-2. Studies into the pathogenesis and manifestations of IL-2 toxicity have offered the hope of developing less toxic approaches to IL-2 therapy. Several lessons from the IL-2 experience are likely to be applicable in the clinical development of other cytokines.\r"

Whole-body scans were done 5.5 hr and SPECT imaging of the abdominal region was done at 6 and 24 hr postinjection of 1100 MBq 99mTc-labeled Mab (1 mg). In the course of primary tumor identification (n = 65), sensitivity of anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy was 95%, specificity 91%. In the diagnosis of early recurrences (n = 76), immunoscintigraphy was the method of choice to clarify the problem (sensitivity 94%; specificity 86%). Overall sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy in patients with suspected colorectal carcinomas and early recurrences was 95%, specificity 88%. Human anti-mouse antibodies were found in 29% (80% predominantly anti-isotypic, 20% predominantly anti-idiotypic). In contrast to anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy, the results of serum CEA levels were rather disappointing. Only 18 out of the 43 surgically verified primary colorectal carcinomas and 17 out of 32 patients with recurrences showed elevated serum CEA levels. In our clinical experience with this 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody, immunoscintigraphy can play an important role in the identification of early colorectal recurrences and in postoperative colorectal cancer patients it should be performed in cases with unclear transmission computed tomography.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with primary breast cancer were studied with a pancarcinoma monoclonal antibody B72.3, an IgG1 molecule directed against tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) present in several tumors. Five millicuries of 111In was used to label 0.2 mg (six patients), or 2 mg (six patients), or 20 mg using the site-directed bifunctional DTPA method (at carbohydrate moiety). Digital, planar, and SPECT images were obtained at 2, 48, 72 and 96 hr when possible. HAMA levels were obtained before the Mab infusion and at 1, 3, and 6 wk postinfusion. Fourteen of 14 known primary breast lesions were detected by imaging (100% sensitivity). Two fibrocystic lesions were negative. Seven of 14 patients had lymph node metastases by histologic methods, but all were missed by radioimmunoscintigraphy. Tumor uptake of Mab ranged 0.00054%-0.0038% of the ID/g. The tumor-to-normal breast tissue ratio was 4.3 +/- 0.91 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Lymph nodes localization of 111In-B72.3 by tissue analysis was similar for tumor-bearing and normal nodes (0.0039 +/- 0.0023 versus 0.0025 +/- 0.0019). Pharmacokinetics revealed mean plasma half-life of 33.3-41.2 hr for the different doses. There was no statistical difference between any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of different doses. HAMA was positive only in 17% of the patients. The study suggests that this antibody has 100% sensitivity for primary breast cancers, but very poor detection rate of metastatic lesions in axillary lymph nodes; thus making it of questionable value in the initial staging process of this disease.\r"

Imaging was done 48 hr after intravenous injection of 74 MBq of 111In-antimyosin Fab. Myocardial antimyosin uptake was visually graded as 0, +1, +2 or +3. A score of +2 or +3 was considered positive. The heart/lung ratio of antimyosin uptake (antimyosin index) also was determined. Antimyosin uptake was positive in seven (100%), nine (90%) and no (0%) patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The antimyosin index in Groups A and B was 2.46 +/- 0.49 and 2.04 +/- 0.24, respectively, findings were significantly higher than that in Group C (1.51 +/- 0.13) (p less than 0.01). Positive biopsy findings were noted in only two patients in Group A. Thus, antimyosin uptake was increased in dilated phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy, which suggests ongoing necrotic changes in these patients.\r"

Identical computer-interfaced cameras continuously monitored gastric activity from anterior and posterior projections. Lag phase was determined by three techniques: (1) inspection of the emptying curve; (2) time to a 2% decrease in stomach activity; and (3) the time of visual appearance of duodenal activity. A short lag phase time was found using all methods, averaging 8.6 min. We concluded that a short solid meal lag phase exists that can be missed with conventional radionuclide gastric emptying methods not employing continuous measurements.\r"

A total of 1153 segments were analyzed, 408 (35%) of which showed a persistent thallium-defect in stress-redistribution images. Of the segments with a decreased 201Tl uptake in these redistribution tomograms, 50.5% had a decreased uptake of both FDG and oPPA; in 21.8% FDG as well as oPPA uptake was within normal range. Normal FDG uptake but decreased oPPA uptake was detected in 17.4%, whereas 10.3% of the segments had normal oPPA uptake but decreased FDG uptake (chi-square test, p less than 0.001). A significant correlation of FDG and oPPA uptake (r = 0.51) was found in the segments with persistent 201Tl defect. Thus, a substantial fraction of persistent thallium-defects after healed myocardial infarction exhibit FDG as well as oPPA uptake, probably due to residual fatty acid metabolism in partially ischemic regions.\r"

Since this neoplasm is composed of follicular epithelial cells, it may concentrate radioiodide (131I) making postoperative 131I imaging for detection of metastases and radiotherapy possible. A 20-yr review of 35 cases diagnosed as anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma at this medical center revealed five patients with insular carcinoma. Four patients showed postoperative 131I localization and received therapeutic doses of 131I. Three of the four showed extrathyroidal 131I localization in neoplastic lesions. In one patient, the resolution of metastatic lesions by magnetic resonance and 131I imaging suggests that 131I may have an important therapeutic role in this aggressive neoplasm.\r"

In 86 patients investigated, liquid and solid-phase studies showed a remarkable variation of single swallow data in normals (relative variation coefficient for liquid: 10%, solid: 14%), which were even higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with disorders (liquid: 31%, solid: 25%). As sum images compensate for this intra-individual variation, false-positive (liquid: 16%, solid: 25%) or negative single swallow findings (liquid: 36%, solid: 27%) are reduced. Qualitative analysis of condensed sum images provided characteristic image patterns representing different pathophysiologic aspects. Since the method introduced better discriminates between normal and pathologic function, it may enhance diagnostic accuracy.\r"

Two hundred fifty microcuries of 99mTc-sulfur colloid were given to outline the gastrointestinal tract. Images were acquired at 4-hr intervals until all capsules were excreted. Normal volunteers (n = 10) consumed a standardized diet 2 days prior and during imaging. Segmental transit times were measured in the following: ascending, transverse, descending, recto-sigmoid colons; hepatic and splenic flexures. The radiation absorbed dose to the large intestine for the SLIT technique is less than half of that associated with other radiographic methods of colonic transit time measurement.\r"

This concept was studied in 20 subjects with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (major stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, minor stenosis less than or equal to 50%). Thirteen had experienced recent transient ischemic attacks and seven had no definite focal symptoms. Subjects underwent Tc-HMPAO cerebral SPECT during acetazolamide dysautoregulation before and after internal carotid endarterectomy. Nine (45%) had perfusion defects that improved after surgery, suggesting surgery had improved cerebral flow reserve. Seven had defects that did not improve after surgery. Four had worsened or new defects after surgery, suggesting perioperative infarcts. The relatively large proportion of patients with improved cerebral blood flow reserve after surgery suggests that this technique may have a significant role to play in assessing which patients might benefit from carotid endarterectomy.\r"

The mean and range of patient follow-up since definitive therapy was 1.6 and 0.5-8 yr, respectively. Abnormal bone scans were correlated with pertinent radiographs. Of 107 bone scans, 16 demonstrated metastatic bone disease. A PSA value of less than or equal to 8 ng/ml excluded bone metastases with a predictive value of a negative test of 98.5%. Without radiographic correlation, abnormal bone scans rarely represented metastases if the PSA value was less than or equal to 8 ng/ml. In summary, serum PSA concentration determines the need for follow-up bone scanning and assists in scan interpretation in patients status post definitive therapy for prostate cancer.\r"

Tip-to-stem and tip-to-sacroiliac joint ratios decreased by 24% and 33%, respectively, between 12 and 49 mo. There was also a decrease in the relative uptakes at the lesser trochanter and calcar in the same time interval.

The beta antagonist, iodocyanopindolol (ICYP), was used to develop a scintigraphic method for depicting the receptors in the living heart. Labeled with 125I, ICYP bound firmly to beta receptors in the rat heart; the data conformed to a mathematical model. In vivo saturation kinetics indicated binding sites with two affinities. Inhibition of ICYP binding by beta antagonists of different potency and different selectivity for beta-1 and beta-2 receptors produced the expected pharmacologic effects. Inhibition by lipophilic and hydrophilic antagonists gave no evidence that ICYP was appreciably bound to internalized receptors. Fractional binding by tracer quantities of (-) ICYP and (+/-) ICYP demonstrated stereospecificity. Labeled with 123I, ICYP bound to the hearts of intact dogs so that scintigraphic tomographs depicted ventricular myocardium. Small doses of beta antagonists selectively reduced the binding of ICYP to lung enabling better visualization of the heart. Thus, 123I-ICYP appears to portray the beta receptors in the living heart, and the characteristics of binding permit the development of mathematical models and lay the basis for quantifying this receptor binding.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a method for the noninvasive estimation of regional tissue glucose utilization in humans that employs positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-(18F)fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG). Unlike other methods, the input function used in this method is obtained from the corrected time-activity curve of the descending aorta, not the left ventricle, because the descending aorta is relatively free of spillover from other organs and extends from the upper thorax to the lower abdomen. With this method the time-activity curve of the descending aorta must be corrected for the partial volume effect and the difference in counts between plasma and whole blood. Using the noninvasively obtained input function, regional tissue glucose utilization was calculated by Patlak graphic analysis. k1k3/(k2 + k3) was in good agreement with k1k3/(k2 + k3) calculated from the plasma input function by arterial sampling (r = 0.9995). These results suggest that the input function and regional tissue glucose utilization (not only of myocardium but also of other thoracic and abdominal organs) can be determined noninvasively.\r"

If the stability of the gallium-transferrin association is sufficiently strong it should be a good macromolecular tracer suitable for quantitative measurements of vascular permeability. Studies of the stability of the gallium transferrin complex in human plasma and serum were done using ultrafiltration and dialysis. It was found that the stability was sensitive to bicarbonate level. Above 13 mM of bicarbonate, 97%-99% of the gallium is bound to molecules greater than 10,000 MW by ultrafiltration. However, at 10 mM binding is 95% and at 7 mM 83%. Similar results were obtained with dialysis. This suggests the gallium-transferrin complex may not be sufficiently stable for quantitative measures of vascular permeability, particularly if the bicarbonate concentration is low.\r"

SPECT studies were acquired 1 day postinjection using a rotating gamma camera system with elliptical orbits in a 360-degree rotation (128 views, 15 sec/view, 64 x 64 matrices). Uniformity-corrected images were reconstructed by use of the circular harmonic transform algorithm with computer software developed in-house. Liver volumes and activities were computed from transverse slices, 1 pixel (6.25 mm) in thickness. Comparison of SPECT and autopsy data demonstrated that absolute values of percent differences between measured and computed liver volumes ranged from 1.0% to 7.2%. Absolute values of percent differences between autopsy data and computed 111In activities in the liver ranged from 2.3% to 7.5%. These results suggest that quantitative SPECT has the potential of becoming an important tool in clinical trials for determining activities and localization volumes of radiolabeled antibodies directly from radionuclide images.\r"

The process involved efficient transchelation of 99mTc from gluconate to 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl 4,5-bis-S-(1-ethoxyethyl) mercaptoacetamidopentanoate as an active ester ligand and subsequent conjugation to antibody lysine amine functional groups. The use of the ethoxyethyl group for sulfur protection allowed optimum yields of 99mTc N2S2 chelate formation with complete retention of the active ester. Subsequent addition of antibody Fab fragment gave 99mTc chelate conjugates indistinguishable from the stepwise in situ esterification and purification of the 99mTc N2S2 complex followed by conjugation as previously shown to give stable 99mTc antibody fragments with retained immunoreactivity and tumor-targeting properties.\r"

Collective bargaining in a professional milieu indicates an unhealthy environment, is incredibly cumbersome, and--perhaps most concerning--is phenomenally expensive, as measured in terms of fiscal resources, human resources, and energies. Moreover, time lost in collective bargaining reduces institutional flexibility and responsiveness. But more important, the collective bargaining process imposes an additional administrative layer and extra legal and contract implementation fees and adds mistrust into a professional setting that requires total trust along with professional competence. Thus, resources are diverted that could be better devoted to excellent patient care and professional salaries. The process of maintaining a union-free environment is well worth the effort. In the end, administration, nursing personnel, and, most important, patient care are positively impacted by an open, flexible environment. In short, within a healthy union-free environment, everyone wins!\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preparation and interpretation of sputum Gram stains by housestaff physicians in the assessment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter study. SETTING: Two university-affiliated hospitals in Pittsburgh. PATIENTS: Ninety-nine cases of clinically and radiographically established pneumonia occurring in 97 patients. Diagnostic test assessment: Housestaff and microbiology personnel prepared a Gram stain for each case of pneumonia. Housestaff assessed the presence and identity of a predominant microbial organism on the slides they prepared. Two senior staff microbiologists, blinded to patient and preparer, evaluated all slides for preparation, sputum purulence, and identification of the predominant organism. Two reference standards were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of housestaff's Gram-stain interpretations: 1) senior staff microbiologists' determinations of the microbes present using the slides without benefit of culture results, and 2) the etiologic agent derived from results of sputum culture, blood culture, or serology. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Housestaff physicians completed a Gram stain in 58% of the pneumonia episodes. Gram stains were not made in 42% of cases, primarily because patients were unable to produce sputum. Fifteen percent of housestaff's smears were judged inadequately prepared, compared with 3% for the laboratory personnel (p less than 0.01). Housestaff obtained purulent sputum samples significantly more often than did nursing personnel (58% versus 38%; p less than 0.01). Housestaff's Gram stains were 90% sensitive for detecting pneumococcus, with a 50% false-positive rate. The sensitivity of the Gram stain was less for identification of Haemophilus influenzae than for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A single antimicrobial agent was chosen as initial therapy for 50% of the patients in whom housestaff identified a predominant organism, compared with 30% in whom a predominant organism was not identified (p less than or equal to 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although housestaff obtained purulent sputum samples more frequently than did nursing personnel, they made systematic errors in the preparation and interpretation of Gram-stained slides. Housestaff physicians should receive formal training in the preparation and interpretation of Gram stains; the specific defects elucidated in this study warrant special attention.\r"

DESIGN: A central laboratory computer identified all consecutive patients with MNL in a one-month period. After exclusion of outpatients, neonates, and patients with hematologic malignancies or incomplete records, the remaining patients were studied and followed until discharge or death. SETTING: Inpatient services of a 988-bed tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 72 inpatients with MNL. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Associated conditions and hospital mortality were recorded. Potentially confounding or contributing variables, including age, sex, intensive care unit stay, infection, acidosis, uremia, malignancy, hemorrhage, surgery or invasive procedure, peak WBC count, and duration of MNL, were examined by multivariate analysis with mortality as the outcome variable. Overall hospital mortality was 29% in study patients. A higher peak WBC count (p = 0.0046), increasing age (p = 0.0058), MNL duration of greater than one day (p = 0.025), and lack of associated invasive procedures (p = 0.04) were jointly significant in the prediction of mortality in MNL patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the impression of poor outcome associated with MNL and validate the use of MNL data in indices of severity of illness and as a prognostic marker for hospitalized patients regardless of underlying disease.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: The Ambulatory Care and Treatment Section of the George Washington University Medical Center ED. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: All patients seen in the Ambulatory Care and Treatment Section of the ED who were 18 years of age or older and who were residents of the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area were eligible to participate. During the six-month study period, 660 patients were asked to participate and 539 (82%) agreed. INTERVENTIONS: Fingerstick cholesterol measurements were performed on all participants. Participants who had elevated cholesterol levels, as determined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines, were scheduled for a six-week follow-up visit in the Lipid Research Clinic, where repeat fingerstick cholesterol measurements were performed. Those participants with elevated cholesterol levels were instructed to follow up with their primary care physicians. Compliance with follow-up was assessed by a telephone contact four months after the initial ED visit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 539 participants, 100 (19%) were found to have elevated cholesterol levels. Fifty-three (53%) returned for the six-week follow-up visit. Of the 53 who returned, 7 (13%) had normal and 46 (87%) had elevated cholesterol levels. Of the 46 participants with elevated cholesterol levels, 15 (33%) reported four months after their ED visit that they had received further follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol screening in the ED is feasible, but compliance with follow-up is less than desirable.\r"

  ".U": "91294930\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To measure any difference in the utilization of hospital resources between alcoholic patients and nonalcoholic patients (controls) in a department of internal medicine. DESIGN: Prospective comparative study. Alcoholics were identified as patients with Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) scores of greater than or equal to 8. Controls were defined as patients with MAST scores of less than or equal to 4, and matched with alcoholics for sex, age, and time of admission. The length of stay, as well as several indicators of utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, was used for the comparison of resource utilization. SETTING: General wards of internal medicine of a 1,000-bed city and teaching hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and three alcoholic patients and 103 controls aged 20-75 years, admitted from September 1, 1988, to March 18, 1989. RESULTS: Alcoholics had the same lengths of stay (16 days), durations of intravenous infusions (six days), and durations of bladder catheterization (one day). Statistically nonsignificant differences were found between alcoholics and nonalcoholics regarding the charges for routine laboratory examinations [693 vs. 734 Swiss francs (Sfrs)], antibiotic therapies (218 vs. 145 Sfrs), and x-ray procedures (568 vs. 774 Sfrs; p = 0.06). The average number of electrocardiograms (two vs. five; p less than 0.005) and the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (one vs. two days; p less than 0.05) were significantly lower for alcoholics than for controls. A total hospital charges index was also lower for alcoholics than for controls (11,900 Sfrs vs. 12,800 Sfrs), but not significantly. CONCLUSION: The authors' results suggest that alcoholics do not use more hospital resources per admission than do nonalcoholics. Moreover, alcoholics tend to use less frequently some procedures, such as the ICU, electrocardiography, and x-ray examinations. Several hypotheses are developed to explain these results in relation to those of previous studies, which showed more use of medical care by alcoholics than by nonalcoholics.\r"

Cases (n = 155) were readmitted to the hospital within 14 days of a hospital discharge, while controls (n = 155) were not. Controls and cases were matched by week of hospital discharge. PATIENTS: Two-year sequential sample of male veterans aged 65 years and over admitted to the Seattle Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. MEASUREMENTS: Data about 31 potential risk factors were abstracted from the medical records. RESULTS: Three risk factors associated with readmission risk were identified and include two or more hospital admissions in the previous year [odds ratio (OR) = 3.06], any medication dosage change in the 48 hours prior to discharge (OR = 2.34), and a visiting nurse referral for follow-up (OR = 2.78). One protective factor--discharge from the geriatric evaluation unit (GEU) (OR = 0.09)--was also determined. CONCLUSIONS: Early unplanned readmissions were frequent at this VA facility. Since the strongest risk factor for readmission was the number of admissions in the previous year, readmissions appeared most commonly among high utilizers of inpatient VA care. This risk factor and others may be useful in identifying a group at high readmission risk, which could be targeted in intervention studies. The reduced readmission rate associated with the GEU suggests one potential intervention to decrease readmission risk.\r"

SETTING: A Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six consecutive interhospital-transferred patients. Nearly all were white men, with a median age of 62.5 years. Fifty percent had three or more active medical problems and 17% had been transferred from intensive care units. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The authors defined informed consent as a discussion of benefits, risks, and alternatives to transfer. Following transfer, patients and physicians were interviewed using standardized parallel questionnaires. Physician-patient communication regarding the benefits and risks of transfer was infrequent. Informed consent was reported for none of the transfers by patient interview, compared with 11% of the transfers assessed by physician interview. Risks of transfer were discussed infrequently according to both physicians (17%) and patients (13%). Physicians perceived a risk to the patient in 21% of patient transfers, and in 36% of transfers defined by objective criteria as high-risk. Physicians recalled discussing benefits of transfer more frequently than did patients (80% vs. 42%,t test, p less than 0.001). Physicians also recalled discussing alternatives to transfer more frequently than did patients (61% vs. 18%, t test p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Verbal informed consent is obtained infrequently prior to interhospital transfer of patients. Risks of transfer are seldom perceived and discussed with patients.\r"

PARTICIPANTS: Duke University Medical Center medical residents during their outpatient rotation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Important deficiencies were found in oral case presentation content. Specifically, psychosocial data were often missing (employment history) was mentioned in 28% of presentations; illicit drug use, in 17%; household social structure, in 11%; sexual history, in 6%). An assessment and a plan were mentioned only 56% and 69% of the time, respectively. No correlation was seen between an objective \"content score\" and the attending physician's subjective rating of the quality of the presentation (r = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: 1) The outpatient care presentation can be quantitatively assessed in a simple, straightforward manner; 2) outpatient case presentations have important deficiencies in content; and 3) preceptors' evaluations of case presentations may be based upon factors other than content of the presentation.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of consecutive patients. SETTING: A university-based Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 133 patients sequentially seen in a general medicine clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Subjects were given a randomly ordered list of 12 common terms, each a qualitative expression of probability. They were asked to indicate what they understood to be the numerical meaning of each word. The patients' probability estimates were found to comprise two groups of five terms each, with high intercorrelations among the probabilities assigned to the terms in each group. Mean probabilities assigned to terms in the first group all were greater than 60%, and mean probabilities assigned to terms in the second group all were below 50%. When asked whether they wanted chance information to be provided in numerical or qualitative terms, 32% reported that they wanted it only numerically; 35.3% wanted it only qualitatively; 21.8% wanted the information either way; and 8.3% wanted the information both ways. CONCLUSIONS: The numerical meanings that patients ascribe to probability terms fall into identifiable patterns. While patients vary in the actual values they assign to terms, the relative meanings of terms show consistent trends.\r"

DESIGN: This cross-sectional observational study focused on psychologically distressed high users of medical services. Frustrating patients were compared with typical and satisfying patients, using data from patient questionnaires, physician assessments, structured psychiatric interviews, and computerized utilization records. SETTING: Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, a large health maintenance organization. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Study patients were in the top decile for ambulatory visits, and bad elevated scores for anxiety, depression, and somatization. Among the 339 patients invited to participate in the study, 251 agreed, and 228 were rated by their physicians. MAIN RESULTS: A substantial proportion (37%) of the high users were viewed as frustrating by their physicians. Physicians' ratings of physical disease severity did not differ among the groups, but frustrating patients rated their own health status less favorably and reported more somatic symptoms and disabilities. The frustrating group utilized more medical services than did other distressed high utilizers. All three groups had a high prevalence of mental disorders. However, frustrating patients had higher rates of somatization and generalized anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and their frustrating patients had contrasting views of the patients' illnesses. The best predictors of physician frustration were somatization and increased medical service utilization. There is need for further research and clinical attention concerning optimal clinical management for patients with somatization.\r"

Data collected for 2 weeks from the time of achieving an enteral energy intake of 100 kcal.kg-1.day-1 included measurements of weight, length, head circumference, and skin-fold thickness, and concentrations of plasma amino acids, serum total protein, prealbumin, retinol-binding protein, and urea nitrogen. In a subset of infants, behavior was assessed at the end of the feeding study with the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. Except for the concentrations of plasma amino acids, there were no significant differences in growth or in other biochemical measurements among the three groups, but there were significant differences in the orientation, habituation, and stability clusters of the behavior assessment. Further, there were significant correlations between the plasma amino acid values and the behavioral clusters. These preliminary data suggest a relationship between protein intake in the neonatal period and behavioral outcome at the end of the feeding period in the absence of differences in growth and gross markers of protein nutritional status. The behavioral items noted to differ among the groups may indicate later cognitive outcome; detailed studies about behavioral responses to neonatal dietary intakes and later outcome seem indicated.\r"

Because an effective oral regimen would be desirable, we compared clindamycin with P + R for treating GABHS carriage. Healthy, symptom-free GABHS carriers were randomly assigned to receive orally administered clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day) three times a day for 10 days or intramuscularly administered benzathine penicillin with oral doses of rifampin (20 mg/kg per day) twice a day for 4 days. Compliance was documented by antibiotic activity in urine. Throat cultures for GABHS were obtained every 3 weeks for up to 9 weeks after treatment. Patients who had positive throat cultures for their original GABHS T type 3 weeks after randomization were crossed over to the other treatment. Treatment success was defined as eradication of the original GABHS T type, with all follow-up cultures negative. Clindamycin eradicated carriage in 24 (92%) of 26 patients; penicillin plus rifampin was effective in 12 (55%) of 22 patients (p less than 0.025). Including patients crossed over 3 weeks after enrollment, clindamycin was effective in 28 (85%) of 33 treatment courses compared with 12 of 22 courses of penicillin plus rifampin (p less than 0.05). We conclude that 10 days of oral clindamycin therapy was significantly more effective than benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin for treatment of symptom-free GABHS carriers.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective sequential open enrollment of neonates with presumed herpes group virus infections. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. PATIENTS: Sixteen neonates with gestational ages between 27 and 40 weeks (median 38 weeks) were given acyclovir between days 1 and 56 of life to treat presumed herpes virus infections. Six infants were critically ill with multisystem disease, five infants had hepatic failure and underwent blood exchange transfusion, and five infants had renal failure. A mean of four (range 1 to 19) serum acyclovir concentrations per patient were measured by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from acyclovir concentrations in 46 samples from 16 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic disposition of acyclovir was described as a two-compartment model. Although the ranges for acyclovir clearance and terminal elimination (t 1/2 beta) were wide, a statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between clearance and beta versus serum creatinine concentration. The average t 1/2 beta for infants with serum creatinine level less than 1 mg/dl (88 mumol/L) was 5.0 hours, and 15.6 hours for those with serum creatinine level greater than 1 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with hepatic or renal dysfunction or young premature infants accumulate acyclovir when dosed without adjustment for organ dysfunction. Measurement of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance can be useful in the dosing of acyclovir in neonates.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, double-blind, prospective study was performed to determine the effects of perioperative administration of morphine or methadone on postoperative analgesic requirements and pain scores in 35 children aged 3 to 7 years undergoing major surgery. After a standardized induction of anesthesia, methadone or morphine, 0.2 mg/kg, was blindly administered, and supplemental doses were titrated to achieve comfort in the recovery room. Pain was assessed during the next 36 hours with a combination of validated behavioral and self-report measures. Patients in the methadone group required fewer supplemental opioid analgesic drugs during the next 36 hours, and reported lower pain scores. No patient had prolonged emergence from anesthesia, and no patient required naloxone or postoperative ventilatory assistance. No major adverse events occurred. We conclude that perioperative intravenous administration of methadone is an effective, inexpensive, and technologically simple means for providing prolonged analgesia for children after surgery.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective study evaluated the cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic effects of esmolol, an intravenous beta-blocker with an extremely short half-life. Twenty patients (aged 2 to 16 years) underwent diagnostic electrophysiologic studies at rest and during beta-blockade induced with esmolol. An initial dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes and followed by an infusion of 200 micrograms/kg per minute. The dosage was increased by 50 to 100 micrograms/kg per minute every 5 to 10 minutes until a reduction of greater than 10% in either heart rate or mean blood pressure was seen. The dosage required to achieve beta-blockade ranged from 300 to 1000 micrograms/kg per minute (mean 550 micrograms/kg per minute). Electrophysiologic effects included a decrease in the rate of sinoatrial node discharge and delay in conduction through the atrioventricular node. There was no effect on His-Purkinje conduction. Atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were unchanged. In six patients with supraventricular tachycardia, esmolol prevented induction of tachycardia in four and slowed the rate of the tachycardia in two. In four patients with ventricular tachycardia, clinical findings were improved in three and unchanged in one. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to near baseline values 10 minutes after the esmolol infusion was stopped. Adverse ventricular electrophysiologic effects were observed in two patients with biopsy evidence of myocarditis. No other adverse effects were seen. We conclude that the effects of esmolol in children are similar to those of other beta-blockers and that it is useful in the evaluation and management of pediatric tachyarrhythmias. The weight-adjusted dosage required to induce beta-blockade in children is larger than the adult dosage, and the effects of esmolol dissipate rapidly.\r"

After an oral dose of metoclopramide, lavage solution was administered by mouth or nasogastric tube at a rate of 40 ml/kg per hour until stools were clear. Emesis occurred in 4 patients, nausea in 11, and abdominal distension in 5. Clear stools were produced in a mean (+/- SE) time of 2.6 +/- 0.3 hours. The volume of lavage solution delivered, which ranged from 15.6 to 183.3 ml/kg, varied inversely with the weight (and age) of the patient. Preparation of the colon was considered optimal in 11 patients, satisfactory in 7, and suboptimal in 2. Small but significant decreases in urine osmolality, blood urea nitrogen, serum glucose, and potassium values were noted at the termination of perfusion. Postperfusion serum glucose concentration in the smallest patient (11.4 kg) was 61 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L). Mean (+/- SEM) change in weight after perfusion was 0.14 +/- 0.05 kg (range -0.2 to +0.6 kg). Of 20 patients, 11 required or requested nasogastric administration of the lavage solution because of its unpleasant taste. We conclude that whole intestinal perfusion with a balanced electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol is safe, acceptable, and efficacious in children.\r"

This resulted in a near normalization of adolescent height. Bone maturation paralleled chronologic age, and therefore the expected final height of the children increased by approximately 10 cm. Administration of growth hormone induced a reversible hyperinsulinemia, with moderate and transient changes in glucose metabolism. A prospective, randomized study, including an untreated cohort, will be needed to confirm the effects on final height and to determine the magnitude of the response in familial short stature.\r"

  ".U": "91294970\r", 
  ".W": "Acute metabolic decompensation in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) during otherwise minor illnesses has generally been presumed to result from massive release of leucine from protein catabolism. A stable isotope method based on the continuous infusion of (2H5)phenylalanine was used to measure protein metabolism in vivo in two children with MSUD during acute illness and when well. Net protein catabolism was greater in the unwell state (0.51 and 0.40 gm/kg per 24 hours in each child, respectively) than in the basal state (0.34 and 0.32). This rate of release of leucine from protein is compatible only with a slow (several days) rather than a dramatic rise in plasma leucine levels during acute illness in MSUD. Poor oral intake leading to a relative increase in time spent in the fasting state appears to be a more important determinant of increasing leucine levels than the catabolic effect of infection in itself. These factors suggested that branched-chain amino acid restriction should be commenced at the start of minor illness in children with MSUD, and that intake of other nutrients should be maintained or increased throughout the illness. A regimen based on these concepts was used during nine episodes of minor illness in two children with MSUD. Plasma branched-chain amino acid levels remained acceptable (less than 700 mumol/L) throughout each of these episodes. Dietary supplementation of this type may reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation during acute illnesses in children with MSUD.\r"

The diagnosis of MSUD had been established during the neonatal period in all four patients, on day 1 of life in three of them. All were in satisfactory control before the intercurrent illness. Two patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. Signs of brain-stem compression occurred after treatment, when biochemical abnormalities were improving. Computed tomography of the head, which was done in two patients, revealed cerebral edema; one of these patients also had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy in one case revealed cerebral edema with herniation. Our experience documents that cerebral edema may occur in the older child with MSUD as well as in the neonate. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in MSUD remains unclear. Early treatment of dehydration and acidosis may prevent the catastrophic consequences that we have observed.\r"

The mean IQ (+/- SD) score in the children with classic MSUD was 78 +/- 24; however, there were two discrete groups: one with normal IQ (greater than 84) whose MSUD had been diagnosed at a mean age of 3.5 days and a second group, with IQ below normal, whose MSUD was diagnosed at a mean of 10 days of age. Affected children treated presymptomatically had higher IQ scores than their affected siblings treated when their disease was symptomatic. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the important influences on IQ were age at the time of diagnosis and long-term metabolic control; control at the time of testing also might have affected performance. The mean score of unaffected siblings was 92 +/- 5 and the mean parental IQ was 83 +/- 9. The mean IQ scores of children with variant MSUD, 97 +/- 4, was similar to that of their parents, 103 +/- 6. This study was not longitudinal and thus could not identify subtle developmental learning problems. We conclude that early and meticulous treatment of MSUD can result in intellectually normal children.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate our impression that hypercalciuria is relatively common in children with osteogenesis imperfecta, we performed a retrospective study of data accumulated from our pediatric population with this skeletal disorder. Children with osteogenesis imperfecta (17 girls, 30 boys; mean (+/- SD) age 7.8 +/- 4.6 years; range 0.7 to 16.8 years) had undergone detailed inpatient evaluation of mineral homeostasis during periods of clinical stability and controlled dietary calcium intake. Hypercalciuria was found in 36% of the patients and averaged (+/- SEM) 6.1 +/- 0.3 mg/kg per 24 hours (0.15 +/- 0.01 mmol/kg per 24 hours) or 392 +/- 28 mg/gm of creatinine (1.10 +/- 0.07 mmol calcium/mmol creatinine) in the group with hypercalciuria. There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, or dietary calcium intake (per kilogram of body weight) between the normocalciuric and hypercalciuric children. However, the group with hypercalciuria was shorter than the normocalciuric group and had a greater lifelong fracture rate. When patient height z scores were regressed against urinary calcium levels, a significant negative correlation was found in the group with hypercalciuria (r = -0.76; p less than 0.001). Although serum alkaline phosphatase activity was lower in the group with hypercalciuria, no difference was found between groups with regard to serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, or osteocalcin. The groups were also similar with respect to both their total body mineral density, as determined by dual-photon absorptiometry (n = 17), and their static indexes of bone formation and resorption, as assessed histomorphometrically with iliac crest specimens (n = 19). We conclude that hypercalciuria occurs frequently in children with osteogenesis imperfecta, and that its magnitude appears to reflect the severity of the skeletal disease.\r"

Rat CMV infection induced an early (7 to 14 day), 2.5-fold increase in circulating B cells (SIgG+) which was associated with moderate increases in the titers of serum IgG antirat type II collagen antibody. A significantly increased skin test reactivity (p less than 0.025) to rat type II collagen was detected at Day 14 and followed a small increase in numbers of W3/25+ T-helper cells in peripheral blood noted at Day 8. A 3-fold expansion of OX8+ peripheral lymphocytes, occurring maximally at Day 8, was tentatively identified as a natural killer cell population by functional 51Cr-release assays. Our data indicate that rat CMV augmentation of collagen induced arthritis is associated with a generalized but modest increase in immune reactivity towards rat type II collagen and with significant alterations of peripheral lymphocyte subsets.\r"

  ".W": "C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations are a useful plasma protein measure that correlate with disease severity and radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We compared 3 drugs with different mechanisms, i.e., tenidap, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, on both CRP levels and soft tissue swelling in the rat adjuvant arthritis model. CRP rose from a normal concentration of approximately 400 micrograms/ml during the first phase of adjuvant arthritis to approximately 1200 micrograms/ml (primary response), then fell to approximately 900 micrograms/ml and rose again as the disease became systemic during the secondary response to approximately 1400 micrograms/ml. When treatment was administered prophylactically, tenidap and dexamethasone suppressed both the primary and secondary CRP and swelling responses. Cyclophosphamide was without effect in the primary response, but inhibited both swelling and CRP in the secondary response. When therapeutic treatment was begun after secondary disease was established, only tenidap and dexamethasone inhibited CRP and swelling. Both dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide decreased lymphocyte numbers during treatment whereas lymphocyte numbers were elevated during tenidap treatment, suggesting a different mechanism of action for tenidap. CRP levels were more closely linked to the rate of change of paw swelling (disease progression) than to paw volume.\r"

The HLA-DR4 frequency in these RF positive RA negative individuals is similar to that observed in series of RA positive patients.

Recurrent episodes occurred in 10 of 36 patients at a median of 8 months after the initial episode. Although tending to occur early in SLE, primary acute psychiatric events may first occur in patients with long durations of illness, and the time of onset of these episodes does not appear helpful in their differential diagnosis.\r"

In contrast, serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with both age (r = -0.236; p = 0.002) and duration of SLE (r = 0.248; p = 0.001), and demonstrated a U-shaped age relationship, being higher in children and older patients.

  ".W": "The association of thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be due to their interference with natural phospholipid dependent anticoagulant mechanisms. We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history. We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural anticoagulants in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects. Patients having had a venous thrombosis in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses. When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS. Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS. The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased. Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural anticoagulants selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS. Thus, deficiencies of natural anticoagulants may occur frequently in patients with SLE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Capillary density was lower, mean diameters of the capillary loops were higher in patients, especially when RP was present (at the venular branch in microns, mean +/- SD: controls: 15.0 +/- 2.0, RP negative patients with SLE: 17.6 +/- 3.6, RP positive patients with SLE: 20.5 +/- 6.3). In a subgroup of 13 patients with frequent Raynaud's attacks (more than 1/week), diameters were still higher (22.1 +/- 7.1, p to controls less than 0.0005; p to RP negative patients less than 0.05).

The end points of the study were control of the disease (recovery and remission) and death. Upon study entry clinical and laboratory features did not differ in the 2 groups. Treatment was stopped in 19 patients because of ineffectiveness in 10 (9 in Group A) and side effects in 9 (8 in Group B). Initial control of the disease was similar in both groups. At 5 years, 27 patients had completely recovered and 14 patients were in clinical remission. The cyclophosphamide-prednisone-plasma exchange association was beneficial in preventing relapses during longterm followup. Nineteen deaths were reported during the followup period. There was no difference between the 10 year cumulative survival rates of the 2 groups (respectively, 72 and 75%).

When the fluid boundary conditions were altered by drilling the femoral neck, femoral head stiffness was reduced by more than 30% (p = 0.045). Refilling of the femoral specimen with saline restored the stiffness to the baseline value. These observations demonstrate that in vitro changes of fluid boundary conditions can alter the mechanical integrity of the femoral head. Alteration in osseous fluid boundary conditions in vivo could affect joint integrity and be of pathogenetic significance in joint disease.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that for anatomically intact murine cartilage, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is the major anabolic stimulus. Using an experimental arthritis model, we found that cartilage from an arthritic joint could not be stimulated in vitro with IGF-1. This nonresponsiveness was not caused by a generalized disturbance of chondrocyte metabolism since forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, could stimulate cartilage from arthritic joints. To investigate whether hydrogen peroxide may cause IGF-1 nonresponsiveness, we exposed normal murine cartilage to H2O2 in vitro as well as in vivo. We found that cartilage, in which chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis was inhibited due to H2O2 action in vitro, showed a normal response to IGF-1 after 24-h tissue culture. A time dependent but full recovery was found. In contrast, cartilage which was longterm exposed to H2O2 in vivo after injection of amidated glucoseoxidase (aGO) showed only a moderate IGF-1 response. This lack of total recovery was not due to chondrocyte death or to retained aGO producing extra H2O2 during tissue culture. Further studies with isolated bovine chondrocytes revealed that H2O2 did not damage the IGF-1 receptor. Binding of radiolabelled IGF-1 to H2O2 treated chondrocytes was unimpaired. Our data indicate that H2O2 inhibits chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis via a mechanism not related to disturbance of IGF-1 signalling. Transient chondrocyte IGF-1 nonresponsiveness found after H2O2 exposure is not related to IGF receptor damage, and contrasts with the complete nonresponsiveness found in arthritic cartilage.\r"

In sex specific analyses, after controlling for age, race and length of followup, persons with radiographic knee OA were more likely than persons without knee OA to report difficulty with physical functioning, particularly for activities involving mobility, transfer and instrumental activities of daily living. However, the association of knee OA with physical functioning was influenced by the radiographic grade of OA and knee pain at NHANES I, suggesting that disease severity and pain are important in anticipating difficulties with physical functioning in persons with knee OA.\r"

The half-lives of both proteoglycan populations were shorter in mature cartilage than in immature tissue (-45%). The amount of proteoglycans released during the initial short phase increases with age, from 23-24% in immature cartilage to 28-29% in mature tissue.\r"

A similar analysis was employed on culture fluids of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed B lymphocytes derived from patients with FMF and healthy controls. No increased incidence of these antibodies was observed among patients with FMF and their relatives compared to healthy controls. It is possible that autoimmune features observed in FMF are the result of nonspecific changes occurring in inflammation and not due to autoimmune mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Disseminated soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of uncommon malignancies generally treated in a uniform manner. This study questioned the impact of schedule on response rate and toxicity in patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma treated with the two-drug combination doxorubicin and dacarbazine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bolus therapy with doxorubicin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 and dacarbazine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 (118 patients) or infusional therapy with doxorubicin at 60 mg/m2 and dacarbazine at 750 mg/m2 delivered by continuous intravenous infusion for 96 hours on days 1-4 (122 patients). Chemotherapy was to be repeated every 3 weeks. A unique feature of this cooperative group protocol was a provision for surgical resection of residual disease in patients with a partial response or with stable disease following chemotherapy. Similar overall response rates (17% in both treatment arms) and complete response rates (5% in both treatment arms) were observed. For patients receiving bolus therapy, the median response duration was 19.6 months for those in complete remission and 6.6 months for those in partial remission. For patients receiving infusional therapy, the median response duration was 12.6 months for those in complete remission and 9.3 months for those in partial remission. Examination of dose intensity received when combining treatment arms revealed a weak doxorubicin dose-response relationship. There was no difference in median survival times between the two treatment arms (bolus therapy, 10.6 months; infusional therapy, 10.5 months; logrank P = .97). Analysis of toxic effects favored infusional therapy. Significant reductions in cardiac toxicity (all events, P = .04; clinical events, P = .01) and nausea and emesis (P = .04) were seen in infusional therapy. Of 47 patients eligible for cytoreductive surgery following chemotherapy, 12 received surgery, and of those 12, eight were rendered disease free. The use of a 96-hour continuous intravenous infusion of doxorubicin-dacarbazine was comparable therapeutically with bolus dosing of these two agents and was better tolerated by the patients.\r"

In clinical trials at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute, patients with metastatic malignant melanomas were treated with IL-2 plus the adoptive transfer of autologous TILs. At the time of treatment, TILs were assayed for in vitro lysis of fresh autologous and allogeneic melanoma cells and Daudi cells. Patients were evaluated for clinical response 4-8 weeks later. Lysis of autologous tumor cells by TILs was significantly higher for responding than for nonresponding patients. Tumor cells from responding and nonresponding patients were equally sensitive to lysis by allogeneic lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. There was no difference between TILs from responding and nonresponding patients for lysis of LAK-sensitive Daudi cells, which was low in most cases and demonstrated that TIL lysis of autologous tumor cells was not due to LAK cells. The observed association of autologous tumor cell lysis by TILs with clinical response suggests that the development of culture methods to optimize lysis of autologous tumors may lead to increased response rates using this TIL treatment regimen.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the state of the p53 gene in gastric cancer. Using one or more methods, we examined 15 specimens from primary carcinomas (14 tumors, one cell line), five cell lines derived from metastases, and seven paired samples of nonmalignant gastric mucosa. Sequence analyses of complementary DNA containing the entire p53 gene open reading frame demonstrated abnormalities in one of five samples from primary tumors and in all five samples from metastases. The single cell line derived from a primary carcinoma had no abnormality of the gene. The six abnormalities included four point mutations, one base-pair deletion resulting in a frame shift, and a 24 base-pair deletion caused by an intronic point mutation (as determined by sequence analysis of genomic DNA). Four of the six mutations mapped to regions highly conserved among species or involved in simian virus 40 T-antigen binding. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies confirmed that chromosome 17p allelic deletions occur only in a minority of primary tumors, but that they may occur more frequently in metastases. Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays detected only a fraction of the p53 gene abnormalities detected by sequencing. Our findings indicate that mutations of the p53 gene are relatively rare in primary gastric tumors but appear to be relatively frequent in cell lines derived from metastatic lesions. Our results may help in understanding the molecular events associated with progression and metastasis in gastric carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A murine model of pulmonary B16 melanoma was used to study the infiltration into metastases of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells and, specifically, to study whether A-LAK cells are able to leave the tumor microcirculation and establish cell-to-cell contact with malignant cells. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that A-LAK cells accumulated in metastases twice as efficiently as LAK cells during interleukin-2 stimulation. Electron microscopy of pulmonary metastases 16 hours after administration of 2.5 x 10(7) A-LAK cells revealed A-LAK cells, identified by the presence of typical two-compartment granules, in direct contact with melanoma cells. This finding was confirmed by using A-LAK cells prelabeled with polycationized ferritin. In conclusion, our observations demonstrate unambiguously the ability of adoptively transferred A-LAK cells to establish contact with extravascular metastatic melanoma cells.\r"

Reproducibility of a tritiated thymidine autoradiography assay for labeling indexes during this 7-year biologically significant time frame was established. A good correlation between tritiated thymidine and a newer technique, bromodeoxyuridine immunoperoxidase staining, was seen. No confounding effect could be attributed to standard colon preparation. On average, both baseline and follow-up values for epithelial proliferation were within the accepted normal range. The presence of essentially normal labeling indexes among colon cancer patients and their high-risk offspring suggests the possibility of the significant effect of dietary factors in reducing proliferation. Such factors may account for the low risk of colon cancer that characterizes the Native-American population in the American Southwest.\r"

We studied whether peritoneal macrophages (PM) from CAPD patients were capable of metabolizing 25-OH-D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3. We found that PM were able to metabolize 25-OH-D3 in vitro; the main product following 16 hours of incubation was 19-nor, 10-oxo, 25-OH-D3 with smaller amounts of 1,25(OH)2D3. However, after shorter incubations of three and five hours a larger portion of 1,25(OH)2D3 was produced. The metabolism of 25-OH-D3 was greatly enhanced in PM harvested during episodes of peritonitis. This property was specific for PM of CAPD patients, and was not found in PM from normal subjects. However, incubation of control PM with peritoneal effluent from CAPD patients resulted in induction of the ability of these cells to metabolize 25-OH-D3. This induction was enhanced by preincubation with peritoneal effluent from CAPD patients suffering from peritonitis. Prostaglandin E2 was found to be involved in this synthesis: addition of PGE2 to normal PM induced metabolism of 25-OH-D3, and incubation of PM from CAPD patients with indomethacin decreased the metabolism of 25-OH-D3. The vitamin D metabolites produced by PM from CAPD patients could have a role in immunological resistance to peritoneal infections.\r"

X-ray documentation was taken in a minimum of four of the six following joints: both hips, wrists and shoulders. The data demonstrate that patients treated solely by AN69 membranes display signs of bone amyloidosis less frequently than do those treated by Cell membranes. Age at onset of dialysis was found to have a striking correlation with the development of carpal tunnel syndrome and bone amyloidosis, while no significant influence was found for hyperparathyroidism, sex or year of first dialysis.\r"

We examined the hypothesis that the biocompatibility of dialysis membranes may influence the ability of lymphocytes to express interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors on their surface, a key event in cellular immune response. We investigated the potential role of the dialysis membrane in eight chronic hemodialysis patients. The study design was a cross-over study using cuprophane and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membranes. Chronic dialysis with new cuprophane membrane leads to an increase in baseline expression of the two subunits of IL-2 receptors. IL2R alpha (p55, CD25) and IL-2R beta (p70), in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). However, Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation of PBMC harvested after two weeks of dialysis with cuprophane membrane showed a markedly decreased expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors. These findings are reversed when patients were dialyzed with a PMMA membrane which is also associated with minimal complement activation. The increased expression of IL-2 receptor subunits are reproduced in vitro by direct contact of PBMC with cuprophane membrane and by the addition of the anaphylatoxin C5a. This study confirms the participation of lymphocytes in the complex blood-membrane interactions that occurs during dialysis; the results may be relevant to observations of immune deficiency in dialysis patients.\r"

The expression of Hox 2.1 and 3.3 were not influenced by mitogenic (epidermal growth factor: EGF, and platelet-derived growth factor: PDGF) nor by hypertrophogenic cytokines (angiotensin II: Ang II) in serum-free media. Transcripts for Hox 2.3, however, were elevated in MCT cells by Ang II. EGF, and serum treatment, as early as 30 minutes after their addition, whereas no change, or slight reductions were observed with transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), PDGF, and gamma-interferon (gamma IFN). Hox 2.3 was also super-induced by serum, in the presence of cycloheximide, in cells rested previously in serum-free media, suggesting that new protein synthesis was not required for expressive augmentation. The induction of Hox 2.3, moreover, was not specific for tubular epithelium, since the gene could be activated in tubulointerstitial fibroblasts after treatment with EGF. These experiments collectively represent a first report regarding the characterization of transcripts encoding homeoboxes in adult cells derived from renal tissue. The putative DNA-binding properties of homeobox proteins in general, the prompt and rapid induction of Hox 2.3 by morphogenic cytokines in tubulointerstitial cells, and the observed effect of cycloheximide on this gene, all indicate that Hox 2.3 might have a role in the general activation of mature somatic cells, as an immediate early event. probably in the capacity of a nuclear trans-acting factor.\r"

However, in interpreting the clinical significance of hypocomplementemia, the following must be kept in mind: 1) There are numerous non-immunologic conditions that also can cause hypocomplementemia. Furthermore, some of these conditions can cause a multisystem disease that, along with the hypocomplementemia, can closely resemble an IC-mediated systemic vasculitis. Furthermore, these nonimmunologic conditions that lower serum complement levels can complicate the course of patients with inactive IC-mediated disease, spuriously indicating that the disease is active. The most relevant of these differential diagnostic problems are listed in Table 2. 2) There are a few conditions (for example, pregnancy) that can raise serum complement levels, thereby possibly obscuring the presence of a disorder (such as, active SLE) that is lowering complement levels. 3) There are some conditions that might be expected to lower serum complement levels, because of their effect on protein metabolism, but do not. Nephrotic syndrome, and moderately poor nutrition are examples. All of these factors should be considered when interpreting results of serum complement levels in a given patient.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine whether TNF was only secreted by mesangial cells or was also present as a cell-associated molecule. LPS-activated mesangial cells which had been fixed in paraformaldehyde lysed the TNF-sensitive L-929 fibroblasts, as assessed by 51Cr release. This cytotoxic activity was inhibited by anti-TNF alpha antiserum. Cell-associated TNF expression was demonstrable after less than one hour of exposure to LPS, peaked at two hours and decreased progressively thereafter, while TNF activity increased in the medium. Mesangial cell-associated TNF was localized at the cell surface, as shown by immunohistochemical demonstration and by the ability of plasma membranes purified from LPS-activated mesangial cells to lyse L-929 fibroblasts. Flow cytometry experiments revealed that two-thirds of LPS-activated mesangial cells were stained by anti-TNF alpha antiserum. The major part of these cell-associated TNF molecules persisted after low pH treatment, indicating that they were integral membrane proteins. As assessed by immunoprecipitation analysis, these proteins were 26 kDa molecules, whereas the released forms of TNF were 17 kDa molecules. Pretreatment of mesangial cells with desferrioxamine (DFX), an iron chelator preventing the synthesis of hydroxyl radicals (OH.), delayed the release of TNF from the membranes into the medium, and enhanced its cell surface expression. It also subsequently accelerated its decay in the medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscle protein synthesis was compared during the anabolic period between sham (S) operated and renal failure (RF) rats that were fed different levels of dietary protein. Male rats weighing between 60 and 80 g first had a partial left nephrectomy and then were given a tryptophan deficient diet from four to six days to induce weight loss. On the second day of the diet either a renal decapsulation (S rats) or a simple right nephrectomy (RF rats) was done to enhance the catabolic response in both and to induce renal failure in the RF rats. Following the period of feeding the deficient diet, both groups were fed a nutritionally complete 14, 17, 20 or 30% protein diet for three to five days. This induced a brisk anabolic response as measured by weight gain. Differences in body weight between the S and RF rats after three to five days on the repletion diet generally was less than 10%. The rats then were fasted overnight, fed a standard meal and muscle protein synthesis (Sm%) was measured two hours post-feeding. Sm% was estimated from the incorporation of 3H phenylalanine (PHE) into muscle 10 minutes following the i.v. injection of 3HPHE (25 muCi/100 g body wt) with carrier PHE to flood all the precursor amino acid pools. Weight loss in the catabolic phase was greater and the net weight gain for the two phases was less in the RF group. Overall, renal failure resulted in a significant reduction in Sm% (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While adenosine release and excretion are enhanced during renal ischemia, the specific sites of renal adenosine production have not been completely elucidated. In the present study, extracellular adenosine concentrations in suspensions of renal outer medulla and thick ascending limb segments were quantitated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Media from other medullary (OM) suspensions incubated for 8 and 15 minutes at 0% oxygen contained significantly greater amounts of adenosine (1.404 +/- 0.21 and 2.034 +/- 0.27 ng/micrograms protein, respectively), when compared to values obtained from media of suspensions incubated for equivalent periods under non-hypoxic conditions (8, 20, and 95% oxygen), 0.78 +/- 0.05 (8 min) and 1.37 +/- 0.21 ng/micrograms protein (15 min). Similarly, adenosine release was greater in medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) suspensions incubated for 8 minutes at 0% versus 8% oxygen (0.81 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.12 ng/micrograms protein, respectively). Moreover, the observed increase in adenosine release by thick ascending limbs at 0% oxygen could be inhibited completely by either furosemide or ouabain. These studies demonstrate that: 1) the renal medulla and medullary thick ascending limb are sites of adenosine release; 2) adenosine release by the mTAL is enhanced significantly during hypoxic conditions; and 3) the increased release of adenosine during hypoxia appears to be related to ion transport and oxidative metabolism, as the increased release was prevented by two disparate inhibitors of transport in this segment.\r"

Studies were performed in rats during hydropenia and volume expansion. In hydropenia, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion tended to be lower in rats with GN than in controls. However, the major differences between the control and GN animals were seen in volume expansion. In the volume expanded groups fractional excretion of sodium was greater in controls (3.20 +/- 0.51%) than in GN (1.20 +/- 0.36%, P less than 0.01). Despite this, delivery to end proximal sites was similar in the two groups in absolute terms and higher in the expanded GN group compared to the expanded controls. Absolute sodium delivery to the bend of the loop of Henle in the expanded GN rats was decreased in absolute terms but increased in fractional terms compared to expanded controls. However, fractional delivery of sodium to the base of the terminal collecting duct was less in GN (3.71 +/- 1.39%) than in controls (7.19 +/- 0.96%, P less than 0.002). In both groups, fractional delivery between tip of the collecting duct fell compared to base (P less than 0.05) but delivery to the tip was again greater in controls (5.49 +/- 1.08%) than in GN (1.51 +/- 0.47%). In GN 62.6 +/- 5.0% of delivered sodium was reabsorbed between collecting duct sites, nearly twofold that of controls (28.8 +/- 9.4%, P less than 0.01). Thus, fractional sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct was enhanced by GN.\r"

We therefore compared binding and uptake of native LDL and oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) to cultured mesangial cells (MC) and the resulting effects on prostaglandin generation and cell proliferation. Ox-LDL, prepared from native LDL by incubation with copper, was bound to MC in a concentration dependent manner with a four- to fivefold increase in binding over LDL. In competition binding experiments Ox-LDL competed to 90% with LDL for binding sites, but LDL only displaced Ox-LDL to 15%. Furthermore polyinosinic acid, which blocks binding of Ox-LDL to macrophages, inhibited binding of Ox-LDL but not that of LDL to MC. Mesangial cells also preferentially took up Ox-LDL over LDL, and Ox-LDL resulted in higher [14C] oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters than LDL, findings consistent with different handling of Ox-LDL and LDL by MC. LDL slightly stimulated mesangial cell proliferation at low concentration (10 to 50 micrograms/ml of LDL) returning to control levels at 100 and 250 micrograms/ml. In contrast Ox-LDL inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, starting at concentrations as low as 10 to 25 micrograms/ml of Ox-LDL. Direct observations of mesangial cells by phase contrast microscopy confirmed the cytotoxic effects of Ox-LDL. Addition of Ox-LDL to mesangial cells resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in PGE2 synthesis within one hour, while at this time point LDL had no significant effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, disulfide reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) had no effect on renin secretion at low concentrations, but strongly inhibited it at high concentrations. Several reagents which are known to primarily deplete cellular reduced glutathione were without effect on renin secretion. The stimulation of renin secretion by PCMPS was rapid in onset, and prevented and reversed by DTT and L-cysteine. Furthermore, the maximal stimulatory effect of PCMPS was not additive to that by diuretics with sulfhydryl reactivity (such as, ethacrynic acid and mersalyl). The stimulatory effect of PCMPS was not affected by diuretics which lack sulfhydryl reactivity (such as, bumetanide and furosemide). These results suggest that sulfhydryl reagents of both with and without diuretic activity stimulate renin secretion by reacting with specific class of sulfhydryl groups which are readily accessible from the extracellular compartment. In addition, these results provide further support the possibility that a sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange in the membrane may play a regulatory role in the renin secretory process.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the mechanism of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure at the parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis level, we measured PTH messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in parathyroid glands in a rat model of chronic renal failure. Four weeks after 7/8 nephrectomy, hyperplasia of parathyroid glands was evident and serum PTH levels were elevated. Serum concentration of calcium, inorganic phosphate, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) of rats with chronic renal failure were not detectably different from those of sham-operated rats. In chronic renal failure rats, PTH mRNA levels were elevated both per RNA and per DNA of parathyroid cells, suggesting increased PTH mRNA levels per cell. The elevated levels of PTH mRNA were returned to normal levels by achieving supraphysiological concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 given i.p. twice at 24 and 48 hours before sacrifice, although this was attended by slight hypercalcemia. A synthetic analogue of vitamin D, 22-oxa-1,25(OH)2D3, also suppressed PTH mRNA to normal levels, but without hypercalcemia. These data suggest that secondary hyperparathyroidism in early chronic renal failure may be due in part to the resistance of parathyroid cells to the physiological concentration of 1,25(OH)2D in circulation on PTH synthesis and that 22-oxa-1,25(OH)2D3 may be useful in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal failure.\r"

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an irreversible inhibitor of ODC and thereby depletes putrescine and spermidine levels in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies in lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice treated with 1% DFMO in drinking water have been associated with improved lifespan, and reduced anti-DNA antibody production, lymphadenopathy, and splenic polyamine levels. Since glomerulonephritis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in lupus, we studied the effect of DFMO on renal histology of MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Female BALB/c and MRL-(+)/+ mice were used as controls. Dose response studies revealed that 1.5% DFMO in drinking water had maximum therapeutic efficacy and produced a significant 79% increase in the median lifespan of a group of 20 mice compared to an equal number of controls (P less than 0.001). Renal histologic studies were performed on kidney sections from four to five mice each from DFMO-treated and untreated groups at 12, 16, 20, 24 and 29 weeks of age. Sections were read blinded to duration and treatment and scored by four major histologic criteria (glomerulonephritis, interstitial inflammation, perivascular inflammation, and vasculitis) and showed significant reduction in all these parameters in DFMO-treated mice when compared to age- and sex-matched untreated mice of the same strain. DFMO treatment had no significant effect on pulmonary histologic findings on these mice. DFMO treatment reduced ODC activity and polyamine concentrations in treated mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracellular HCO3-, K+ and Cl- concentrations [ion]i in parallel with cell membrane potential (PD), cell membrane conductance (Gm) and conductances of individual ions (Gmion) were evaluated with microelectrode techniques. Fused cells regulate their cell volume by about 50%. Gm increased from 0.43 +/- 0.03 mS/cm2 in isotonic Ringer solution to 4.3 +/-0.3 mS/cm2 in the steady state phase of cell swelling. GmCl was 0.31 +/- 0.03 mS/cm2 in isotonic Ringer solution and thus was the dominant individual ion conductance. In the initial phase of cell swelling GmK increased transiently 64-fold to 0.32 +/- 0.03 mS/cm2, and consequently PD hyperpolarized. At peak hyperpolarization GmCl transiently decreased by 15%. Cell swelling increased GmCl 11-fold and GmHCO3 28-fold to 0.95 +/- 0.1 mS/cm2 in the steady state phase of cell swelling. In this phase GmCl and GmHCO3 were dominating, whereas GmK was only slightly increased compared to isotonic conditions. The hyperpolarization of PD was paralleled by cytoplasmic acidification. At peak acidification [HCO3-]i decreased by 6.4 mmol/kg H2O. Cl- extrusion was not detectable in the initial phase of cell swelling. In isotonic Ringer solution [K+]i was 125 +/- 5 mmol/kg H2O. During the initial phase of cell swelling 23 +/- 5 mmol/kg H2O K+ was extruded, indicating that yet unknown anions participated in cell volume regulation in this phase of cell swelling. In the steady state phase of cell swelling [pH]i was normalized by replenishing [HCO3-]i, whereas Cl- was extruded. We conclude that fused renal epitheloid cells acutely release KHCO3 in response to hypotonicity, but then regain pH homeostasis in the steady state phase of cell swelling.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma prorenin is normally higher than renin and usually changes in response to the same stimuli. In dogs, plasma prorenin and renin disappear after bilateral nephrectomy, indicating that both are of renal origin. It has been proposed that prorenin may mediate tissue renin systems via its reversible intrinsic renin-like activity. The renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the changes in renal function that occur with bilateral ureteral obstruction, but plasma prorenin has not been investigated. We therefore studied the effect of 48-hour bilateral obstruction on plasma prorenin in two groups of dogs: one was volume expanded (N = 5), while the other group (N = 6) was euvolemic. Plasma prorenin concentration increased fourfold in both groups, angiotensinogen increased twofold, while plasma renin activity was unchanged. Following release of obstruction, plasma renin fell slightly while prorenin and angiotensinogen remained elevated. There was a positive relationship between plasma prorenin and renin before (r = 0.63, P less than 0.05) and after (r = 0.76, P less than 0.01) obstruction. Post-obstruction, ERPF and GFR were subnormal but filtration fraction was maintained; the higher the ERPF and GFR the higher the plasma prorenin post-obstruction (r = 0.83, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.77, P less respectively; N = 11). These results show that impairment of renal function during bilateral obstruction is associated with an increase in plasma prorenin but not renin. Nonetheless, there is a positive relationship between plasma prorenin and renin both pre- and post-obstruction. Thus, preferential impairment of clearance of prorenin relative to renin may occur during bilateral obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Human beta 2m was isolated from peritoneal dialysate using ion-exchange and gel chromatography and radiolabeled with 125I. Patients were injected with 10 microCi labeled beta 2m. In one study (N = 4), plasma activity was measured over 72 hours. In a second study (N = 4), patients received low-flux dialysis 24 hours after injection and high-clearance dialysis (Bellco BL655) at 48 hours. Plasma activities were fitted to a three-compartment, variable volume model. Endogenous beta 2m levels (radioimmunoassay) were 56 +/- 6 mg/liter. The beta 2m distribution volume was 12.7 +/- 2.0 liter (0.20 +/- 0.03 liter/kg) and the non-renal clearance was 3.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min. The generation rate, 9.9 +/- 1.7 mg/hr (0.16 +/- 0.04 mg/kg/hr), was similar to that measured in subjects with normal renal function. The three compartment model derived from the turnover data gave an adequate fit of the arterial concentrations of endogenous and exogenous beta 2m during low-flux (nil beta 2m clearance) and high-clearance (beta 2m clearance of 19 ml/min) dialysis. Simulations based on this model indicate that extracorporeal treatment can at best remove about 50% of weekly production. These results suggest that beta 2m production is not increased in dialysis patients, that there is substantial non-renal beta 2m clearance, and that the amount of beta 2m that can be removed by extracorporeal therapy is therefore limited.\r"

In this study, we examined the involvement of these three mediators and the protective effect of simultaneous inhibition of all three in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis in rats. A single intraperitoneal injection of PAN (100 mg/kg) induced massive proteinuria and enhanced production of TXA2 and LTs from arachidonic acid in renal cortical slices and renal glomeruli, and increased malondialdehyde levels in plasma, urine and renal cortex. Oral administration of CV-6504(HCl) (3 to 20 mg/kg/day, for 1 to 2 weeks), a novel treble inhibitor of TXA2 synthetase, 5-lipoxygenase and lipid peroxidation, dose-dependently attenuated PAN-induced proteinuria and the increases in these three mediators. Any single specific inhibitor (CV-4151, a TXA2 synthetase inhibitor; AA-861, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; or CV-3611, a radical scavenger) or a combination of two inhibitors showed no or only a slight antiproteinuric effect, but the combination of all three inhibitors significantly reduced PAN-induced proteinuria. These results suggest that, these three mediators may be involved in the pathogenesis of PAN nephrosis and that CV-6504(HCl), which can simultaneously inhibit all three, may be a useful therapeutic agent for nephrosis.\r"

To study the effects of oral fatty acid intake on the development of renal injury in this model, rats were fed standard chow or chow supplemented with either 14% fish oil or 14% beef tallow after unilateral nephrectomy at the age of 10 weeks. At 32 weeks post-nephrectomy animals were sacrificed and renal tissue saved to assess histology and glomerular eicosanoid production. Fish-oil treated rats had lower mean plasma cholesterol levels and developed less proteinuria than control or tallow-fed animals although there was no difference in plasma creatinine or blood pressure. Histological analysis showed significantly fewer sclerosed glomeruli in the fish oil group (4.0 +/- 0.8% vs. control 19.4 +/- 4.1%, P less than 0.0005 and vs. beef tallow 10.8 +/- 1.9%, P less than 0.005). Glomeruli derived from rats on fish oil supplements produced smaller amounts of prostaglandin (PG)E2 and of the stable metabolites of PGI2 (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha), PGF2 (PGF2 alpha) and thromboxane (TX)A2 (TXB2) than those from tallow-fed animals. This study demonstrates that oral fatty acid intake may influence the development of glomerulosclerosis. The apparent beneficial effects of fish oil have not been fully defined, but may relate to favorable changes in plasma lipid concentration and renal eicosanoid production.\r"

By using in situ hybridization technique, mRNA for angiotensinogen has been shown to be present in the proximal tubule. In the present study, we have attempted to examine the production of angiotensinogen and renin-like activity by the proximal convoluted (PCT) and straight (PST) tubular cells. PCT and PST cells were obtained from microdissected rabbit proximal tubules and cultured in vitro. Angiotensinogen and renin-like activity were quantitated in culture media and cell lysates. It was found that PCT culture medium contained both angiotensinogen and renin-like activity, whereas only angiotensinogen was detected in PST culture medium. Support for de novo synthesis is provided by the observation that both angiotensinogen and renin-like activity in PCT culture medium increased in a time-dependent and hormone-sensitive manner in defined serum-free medium. These results thus demonstrate the actual production of angiotensinogen and renin-like activity by proximal tubular cells, and indicate that these locally synthesized components may contribute to the regulation of angiotensin generation in renal proximal tubule.\r"

Preliminary studies of this inhibitor have suggested that it may have a role in decreasing bone mass, possibly by suppressing bone cell proliferation. Since the in vitro bioassay of crude sulfation inhibitor preparations is relatively nonspecific, we investigated whether there might also be an inhibitor of osteoblast mitogenesis in uremic plasma. We fractionated plasma and plasma ultrafiltrates from dialysis patients by gel filtration chromatography and looked for inhibition of mitogenesis in cultured osteoblasts. Material from fractions with a molecular weight range of 750 to 900 inhibited osteoblast mitogenesis. The inhibitory effect, however, could be overcome with serum or insulin-like growth factor-I, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition was not growth factor dependent. Further characterization of the inhibitor revealed that it was not a peptide or a polar lipid. We conclude that uremic plasma contains a bone cell mitogenic inhibitor which may have a role in regulating bone remodeling in adults and bone growth in children.\r"

However, no significant expression of c-N-ras, c-mos or c-myb genes was found in the mononuclear cells of these patients. When the amount of urinary protein excretion was used as an indicator of disease activity (greater than 1 g/day), a positive correlation was found between c-myc, c-raf, c-fos, and c-jun expression and urinary protein excretion (P less than 0.01). The expression of these genes correlated also with the serum IgA concentration (P less than 0.01), IgA immune complex (P less than 0.01), and histopathological changes in renal tissues obtained from patients with IgA nephropathy (P less than 0.01). The results of this survey suggest that abnormally regulated proto-oncogene expression in mononuclear cells may play an important role in the progression of IgA nephropathy and may be useful as an indicator of disease activity and/or prognosis.\r"

In the present study, we attempted to determine the respective influence of hemodialysis (HD) and uremia on the plasma level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which shares several biological properties with IL-1 and TNF alpha, including the induction of the acute phase response of the inflammatory process. Forty-eight patients with end-stage renal failure, including 32 long-term HD patients and 16 chronic uremic patients undergoing their first dialysis session, were tested for plasma IL-6 using both biological and immunoreactive assays. Plasma IL-6 activity was significantly increased in patients with chronic renal failure (P less than 0.001) compared to its level in normal individuals. No difference was observed, however, between long-term and not yet dialyzed patients. In the patients with the most pronounced IL-6 activity, immunoreactive IL-6 levels between 60 and 150 pg/ml were detected. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human IL-6 inhibited the activity of plasma in the IL-6 bioassay, and a close correlation existed between the biological activity of IL-6 and its immunoreactive level. No change in plasma IL-6 was detected during the course of the first dialysis as well as subsequent sessions. Likewise, no influence of the nature (cellulosic or synthetic polyacrilonitrile) of the dialysis membrane equipping the dialyzer was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, there was a significant increase in the HLA-DQw7 allele frequency (71%) (c = 27.8%, chi 2 = 29.2, P less than 0.001, Relative Risk = 6.17). This can be explained by linkage disequilibrium between the DQw7 allele at the DQB1 locus and DRB1 genes of some DR4 and all DR5 haplotypes. The polymorphic portion of the DQ alpha chains from DR4, DQw7 and DR5, DQw7 haplotypes differ but they have identical DQ beta chains.

Normal values of intrarenal hemodynamic parameters were obtained in 24 normotensive subjects without ureteral catheterization, assuming each kidney had the half function of both kidneys. Systemic mean arterial pressure did not differ between essential and renovascular hypertension (141 +/- 3 vs. 148 +/- 3 mm Hg). Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates were decreased in the stenotic kidney of RVH (98 +/- 8, 24 +/- 2 ml/min/m2), while increased in the contralateral kidney (195 +/- 11, 48 +/- 2), compared with the right kidney of essential hypertension (162 +/- 8, 33 +/- 1). Although effective renal plasma flow rate was not different from normal (191 +/- 8), glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in the contralateral kidney of RVH than in normal (38 +/- 1). RA was elevated due to the stenotic lesion in the stenotic kidney (28,500 +/- 1,900 dyns.sec.cm-5), while the elevation in the contralateral kidney (10,800 +/- 600) was less than in the right kidney of essential hypertension (14,900 +/- 1,200). RE (5,800 +/- 300) in both kidneys of RVH was higher than in the right kidney of essential hypertension (4,500 +/- 200).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of KCl, KHCO3, NaCl and NaHCO3 supplements, 90 mmol/day for four days, were compared in ten subjects fed normal constant diets. Using synthetic diets, the effects of dietary KCl-deprivation for five days followed by recovery were assessed in four subjects and of KHCO3-deprivation for five days followed by recovery were assessed in four subjects. On the fourth day of salt administration, daily urinary Ca excretion and fasting UCa V/GFR were lower during the administration of KCl than during NaCl supplements (delta = -1.11 +/- 0.28 SEM mmol/day; P less than 0.005 and -0.0077 +/- 0.0022 mmol/liter GFR; P less than 0.01), and lower during KHCO3 than during control (-1.26 +/- 0.29 mmol/day; P less than 0.005 and -0.0069 +/- 0.0019 mmol/liter GFR; P = 0.005). Both dietary KCl and KHCO3 deprivation (mean reduction in dietary K intake -67 +/- 8 mmol/day) were accompanied by an increase in daily urinary Ca excretion and fasting UCaV/GFR that averaged on the fifth day +1.31 +/- 0.25 mmol/day (P less than 0.005) and +0.0069 +/- 0.0012 mmol/liter GFR (P less than 0.005) above control. Both daily urinary Ca excretion and fasting UCaV/GFR returned toward or to control at the end of recovery. These observations indicate that: 1) KHCO3 decreases fasting and 24-hour urinary Ca excretion; 2) KCl nor NaHCO3, unlike NaCl, do not increase fasting or 24-hour Ca excretion and 3) K deprivation increases both fasting and 24-hour urinary Ca excretion whether the accompanying anion is Cl- or HCO3-. The mechanisms for this effect of K may be mediated by: 1) alterations in ECF volume, since transient increases in urinary Na and Cl excretion and weight loss accompanied KCl or KHCO3 administration, while persistent reductions in urinary Na and Cl excretion and a trend for weight gain accompanied K deprivation; 2) K mediated alterations in renal tubular phosphate transport and renal synthesis of 1.25-(OH)2-vitamin D, since KCl or KHCO3 administration tended to be accompanied by a rise in fasting serum PO4 and TmPO4 and a fall in fasting UPO4 V/GFR, a fall in serum 1,25-(OH)2-D and a decrease in fasting UCa V/GFR, while dietary KCl or KHCO3 deprivation were accompanied by a reverse sequence.\r"

The extracorporeal dialysis circuit was flushed regularly with saline to avoid clotting and the use of heparin. Percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsies were taken before and after the dialysis to determine the content of free amino acids together with the concentration and size distribution of ribosomes before and after dialysis. After dialysis the alanine concentration in muscle decreased by 20% (P less than 0.05), while all other amino acids were unaffected. The total ribosome concentration per mg of DNA decreased by 31% (P less than 0.01) and the relative proportion of polyribosomes by 7% (P less than 0.05) after the dialysis compared to predialytic values. All individual plasma amino acids decreased during the dialysis procedure except for threonine and arginine, which were unaltered, and leucine and isoleucine, which increased. The decline in ribosome and polyribosome content together with the changes in amino acid levels indicate a low capacity for protein synthesis and increased catabolism in muscle of hemodialyzed patients.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, there have been reports of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2 m) related amyloid deposition in perineural and periarticular tissues in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis, but it has been rarely described in bone. We, therefore, examined previously obtained bone biopsy specimens in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis to determine the prevalence of beta 2 m deposition in bone and to assess the relationship between beta 2 m deposits and bone histomorphometry. We found beta 2 m deposits in bone in 8% of 224 patients examined. Bone deposition of beta 2 m was absent in patients who were on dialysis for less than six years, but was present in 19% who dialyzed longer than 10 years. beta 2 m deposits were found in specimens from the iliac crest, femoral bone, tibia, vertebra and rib. In the iliac crest beta 2 m deposition was localized predominantly to the periosteum. Among these patients with beta 2 m in iliac crest periosteum, 62% had suffered a femoral neck fracture compared to only 4% of matched patients who had negative staining for beta 2 m in the iliac crest (P less than 0.001). Histologically, osteitis fibrosa seemed more common in patients positive for beta 2m than in patients negative for beta 2m deposition. We conclude that beta 2m deposition in bone is common in uremic patients who have received hemodialysis longer than 10 years. The high prevalence of femoral neck fracture in patients with beta 2m localized to the periosteum of the iliac crest suggests that this involvement may be useful to predict susceptibility to femoral fracture.\r"

Forty-one of these patients (13.4%) were positive for IgG/IgM antibodies against entactin: 60% of them had primary glomerulonephritis, 35% had secondary glomerulonephritis, while the remaining 3 patients had other nephropathies. Fifteen (70%) of the 23 patients with primary glomerulonephritis had proliferative glomerulonephritis (PGN), whereas 13 (87%) of the 15 patients with secondary glomerulonephritis were due to systemic connective tissue diseases (SCTD): 7 due to SLE, 4 due to SLE like SCTD and two due to other SCTD. There was a peak of incidence corresponding to the group aged 18 to 30 years. A majority of these patients (12 of the total 17) had primary glomerulonephritis and were associated with nephrotic or subnephrotic grade proteinuria, poorly or nonresponsive to immunosuppressive treatment and associated, in several cases, with progressive deterioration of renal function. In addition, there was a tendency to another peak in the age group 51 to 60 years. Most of these patients (6 of the total 8) had glomerulonephritis secondary, mainly, to SLE or SLE like SCTD with milder degree of proteinuria and better preserved renal functions. Anti-entactin antibodies were not found in certain glomerulonephritides like IgA nephropathy and those secondary to systemic vasculitides and in control subjects (healthy subjects, and patients with a variety of non-renal disorders including inflammatory diseases).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relation between inhalation of ambient concentrations of ozone and airway reactivity to inhaled allergens may be important in asthma, since both agents can produce inflammatory changes in the airways. Seven asthmatic patients (mean age 40 [SD 13] years), with seasonal symptoms of asthma and positive skin tests for ragweed or grass, took part in a study to investigate whether exposure to low concentrations of ozone potentiates the airway allergic response. The patients were studied during 4 separate weeks in the winter. In each week there were 3 study days: on days 1 and 3 methacholine challenges were carried out; and on day 2 the subject received one of four combined challenges in a single-blind design--air breathing followed by inhalation of allergen diluent (placebo); ozone followed by inhalation of allergen diluent; air followed by allergen; or ozone followed by allergen. The ozone concentration was 0.12 ppm during 1 h of tidal breathing at rest, and allergens were inhaled until the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) had fallen by 15% (PC15). There were no significant differences in baseline FEV1 after exposure to ozone but PC15 was significantly reduced when allergen was preceded by ozone inhalation: the mean PC15 after air was 0.013 (SD 0.017) mg/ml compared with 0.0056 (0.0062) mg/ml after ozone (p = 0.042). Thus, low ozone concentrations, similar to those commonly occurring in urban areas, can increase the bronchial responsiveness to allergen in atopic asthmatic subjects. This effect does not seem to be the result of changes in baseline airway function.\r"

Infectious HIV was detected at some time during pregnancy in 59% of women from plasma and in 83% from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells or plasma. HIV was not isolated from any of the newborn babies (0/27) at birth. The mothers had a significantly higher frequency of viraemia during pregnancy than their children had by 6 months of age (p = 0.002); by this time HIV was recovered from 5 (26%) of 19 infants. HIV was not detected by virus isolation, in-situ hybridisation, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10 fetuses; the other 2 fetuses were positive either by in-situ hybridisation or by PCR but neither result could be confirmed in a second organ or by the other methods of detection. The findings show that there is no consistent spread of HIV across the placenta during maternal viraemia, and indicate that in most cases transmission occurs close to or at delivery.\r"

The impaired absorption of this strongly lipophilic drug may be due to reduced intestinal absorptive area, suboptimal mixing of the drug with hepatobiliary secretions, or residual cholestasis. Improvement of cyclosporin absorption was sought by means of oral coadministration of d-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene-glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS), a water-soluble form of vitamin E which can form micelles. 25 mg/kg daily of TPGS was given to six paediatric liver transplant recipients and one young adult with severe hepatobiliary graft-vs-host disease after bone-marrow transplantation, who required 29-136 mg/kg cyclosporin daily to achieve therapeutic cyclosporin blood concentrations. Five responded; the oral cyclosporin dose could be reduced by 40-72% within 2 months. In addition, intravenous cyclosporin was stopped in two of the responders. In the two non-responders the cyclosporin doses at entry were similar to those in the responders after TPGS treatment. Oral cyclosporin absorption tests correctly predicted the outcome of treatment in three responders and one non-responder tested. Treatment with TPGS to enhance cyclosporin absorption might be a useful way of reducing the high cost of immunosuppression in paediatric liver transplant recipients.\r"

Total ELF glutathione rose transiently, ELF oxidised glutathione concentrations increased, and there was a decrease in spontaneous superoxide anion release by alveolar macrophages.

To see whether single episodes of acute unintentional organophosphate intoxication lead to chronic neuropsychological dysfunction, we carried out a retrospective study of agricultural workers in Nicaragua who had been admitted to hospital between July 1, 1986, and July 31, 1988, for occupationally related organophosphate intoxication. This \"poisoned\" group (36 men) was tested on average about two years after the episode of pesticide poisoning and compared with a matched control group. The poisoned group did much worse than the control group on all neuropsychological subtests, with significantly worse performance on five of six subtests of a World Health Organisation neuropsychological test battery and on 3 of 6 additional tests that assessed verbal and visual attention, visual memory, visuomotor speed, sequencing and problem solving, and motor steadiness and dexterity. Differences in neuropsychological performance could not be explained by other factors. The findings of a persistent decrease in neuropsychological performance among individuals with previous intoxication emphasise the importance of prevention of even single episodes of organophosphate poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed 153 episodes of cobalamin deficiency involving the nervous system that occurred in 143 patients seen over a recent 17-year period at 2 New York City hospitals. Pernicious anemia was the most common underlying cause of the deficiency. Neurologic complaints, most commonly paresthesias or ataxia, were the first symptoms of Cbl deficiency in most episodes. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12 was 4 months, although long delays in diagnosis occurred in some patients. Diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings. A wide variety of neurologic symptoms and signs were encountered, however, including ataxia, loss of cutaneous sensation, muscle weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, spasticity, urinary or fecal incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, loss of vision, dementia, psychoses, and disturbances of mood. Multiple neurologic syndromes were often seen in a single patient. In 42 (27.4%) of the 153 episodes, the hematocrit was normal, and in 31 (23.0%), the mean corpuscular volume was normal. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were unusual even in anemic patients. In nonanemic patients in whom diagnosis was delayed, neurologic progression frequently occurred although the hematocrit remained normal. In 27 episodes, the serum cobalamin concentration was only moderately decreased (in the range of 100-200 pg/ml) and in 2 the serum level was normal. Neurologic impairment, as assessed by a quantitative severity score, was judged to be mild in 99 episodes, moderate in 39 and severe in 15. Severity of neurologic dysfunction before treatment was clearly related to the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In addition, the hematocrit correlated significantly with severity, independent of the longer duration of symptoms in nonanemic patients. Four patients experienced transient neurologic exacerbations soon after beginning treatment with cyanocobalamin, with subsequent recovery. Followup evaluation was adequate to assess the neurologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in 121 episodes. All patients responded, and in 57 (47.1%), recovery was complete, with no remaining symptoms or findings on examination. The severity score was reduced by 50% or greater after treatment in 91% of the episodes. Residual long-term moderate or severe neurologic disability was noted following only 7 (6.3%) episodes. The extent of neurologic involvement after treatment was strongly related to that before therapy as well as to the duration of symptoms. The percent improvement over baseline neurologic status after treatment was inversely related to duration of symptoms and hematocrit. Some evidence of response was always seen during the first 3 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From 1956 through 1989, 38 men and 26 women were seen at the Mayo Clinic with biopsy-proven AA. The underlying disorder was rheumatic disease in 42, infectious disease in 11, inflammatory bowel disease in 6, and other causes in 5. All patients were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Fifty-eight of the 64 patients had proteinuria or renal insufficiency. Fourteen also had significant symptoms of gastrointestinal amyloid, and 6 had amyloid goiter. None of the patients had symptomatic cardiac involvement, and only 3 had palpable hepatomegaly. Renal, gastric, rectal, fat, and marrow biopsies were positive for amyloid in 100%, 94%, 82%, 58%, and 46% of tested patients, respectively. The median survival of the entire group was 24.5 months. Thirty-five of the 47 deceased patients died as a direct result of their amyloidosis, primarily from complications of renal failure. Nine were successfully treated and had regression of the disease. Two with bronchiectasis responded to long-term cyclic antibiotic therapy, as did 1 patient with osteomyelitis. One patient with inflammatory bowel disease responded to surgical resection, and 1 with familial Mediterranean fever responded to colchicine. Four patients with rheumatic disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (in 2) and methotrexate (in 2), with complete resolution of their renal disease. All 9 successfully treated patients are alive, with a median follow-up of 58 months. Statistical analysis revealed that creatinine values greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl (P less than 0.003) and a serum albumin value less than 2.5 g/dl (P less than 0.02) were associated with a poorer survival. The single strongest variable associated with poor survival was a serum creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dl at presentation, with a median survival of 11.2 months compared to patients with a creatinine level less than 2.0 mg/dl, with a median survival of 56.9 months.\r"

  ".W": "Poikilothermia, the inability to maintain a constant core temperature independent of ambient temperature, markedly influences both the mental and physical function of affected patients; furthermore, prolonged hypothermia can induce numerous complications. To establish the pathophysiology of thermoregulation underlying poikilothermia in man, we compared 4 women with acquired poikilothermia, with 9 female control subjects. The activity of the main thermoregulatory effector mechanisms was assessed in a thermoneutral environment, and during subsequent cold stress and heat exposure. At thermoneutrality the patients had a significantly lower rectal temperature and resting metabolic rate compared with the controls; no patient showed peripheral vasoconstriction or shivering. Cooling revealed markedly reduced peripheral vasoconstriction in 3 patients and failure of the metabolic response in 2 patients; unlike controls, no patient exhibited shivering. Heat challenge revealed severely reduced capacity for heat dissipation in all patients. We conclude that in patients with poikilothermia, the mechanisms for both heat conservation and heat dissipation are seriously attenuated. Careful monitoring of the core temperature and adequate measures to maintain normothermia are of great importance in patients with poikilothermia in order to provide adequate treatment, improve the quality of life, and prevent serious complications.\r"

  ".U": "91295802\r", 
  ".W": "Bazex syndrome (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica) is characterized by a psoriasiform eruption that favors acral sites and has been associated with an underlying malignancy in all reported cases. Of the 93 patients in this series, 89 were male with a mean age of 60 +/- 8.5 years. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and squamous cell tumors of unknown primary with cervical lymph node metastases were the most commonly associated neoplasms, suggesting that the factor(s) responsible for the development of the syndrome are relatively specific for tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract. The cutaneous lesions were erythematous to violaceous in color and had associated scale; the most frequently observed sites of involvement were the ears, nose, hands, and feet, including the nails. In 63% of the cases, the cutaneous lesions preceded the initial symptoms or diagnosis of the tumor by an average of 11 months (range, 1-72) and, in general, the eruption was resistant to a variety of topical treatments. Occasionally, a reappearance of the papulosquamous lesions signaled the recurrence of the tumor (6 cases) or the appearance of skin lesions coincided with the development of metastatic disease (3 cases). In 91% (64/70) of the patients, the skin eruption either improved significantly following treatment of the underlying malignancy or did not improve in the setting of persistent tumor. However, even when all of the skin lesions cleared, the nail dystrophy often persisted. Fifteen of the patients developed vesicles, bullae, and crusts in addition to papulosquamous lesions. Possible explanations include the formation of an epidermal-dermal split via a bullous lichen planus-like mechanism, or the coexistence of two diseases; i.e., acrokeratosis paraneoplastica plus either porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous pemphigoid, or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. One possible explanation for the development of the characteristic cutaneous eruption is an immune reaction, humoral or cellular, directed against a common antigen present on the tumor and the normal skin. Alternatively, tumor production of a keratinocyte growth factor such as TGF-alpha may be involved in the induction of the psoriasiform skin lesions.\r"

It has also been suggested that fullerenes might be formed in sooting flames, and indeed all-carbon ions with mass/charge ratios suggestive of fullerenes have been detected in flames. These species were assumed to have the cage structures of fullerenes, but the mass spectroscopic evidence could not establish this conclusively. We have now collected samples of condensible compounds and soot from hydrocarbon combustion under a range of conditions, and analysed these using conventional techniques in an effort to detect fullerenes. Spectroscopic studies reveal the presence of C60 and C70 in yields and ratios that depend on temperature, pressure, carbon/oxygen ratio and residence time in the flame. Control of these conditions allows optimal yields of 3 g of fullerenes per kilogram of fuel carbon burned, and variation of the C70/C60 ratio over the range 0.26-5.7.\r"

  ".W": "Binocular neurons in the visual cortex are thought to perform the first stage of processing for the fine stereoscopic depth discrimination exhibited by animals with frontally located eyes. Because lateral separation of the eyes gives a slightly different view to each eye, there are small variations in position (disparities), mainly along the horizontal dimension, between corresponding features in the two retinal images. The visual system uses these disparities to gauge depth. We studied neurons in the cat's visual cortex to determine whether the visual system uses the anisotropy in the range of horizontal and vertical disparities. We report here that there is a corresponding anisotropy in the cortical representation of binocular information: receptive-field profiles for left and right eyes are matched for cells that are tuned to horizontal orientations of image contours. For neurons tuned to vertical orientations, left and right receptive fields are predominantly dissimilar. Therefore, a major modification is required of the conventional notion of disparity processing. The modified scheme allows a unified encoding of monocular form and binocular disparity information.\r"

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is the mediator of the initial Ca2+ release, although its role in the mechanism underlying Ca2+ entry remains controversial. We have now used two techniques to introduce inositol phosphates into mouse lacrimal acinar cells and measure their effects on Ca2+ entry: microinjection into cells loaded with Fura-2, a fluorescent dye which allows the measurement of intracellular free calcium concentration by microspectrofluorimetry, and perfusion of patch clamp pipettes in the whole-cell configuration while monitoring the activity of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels as an indicator of intracellular Ca2+. We report here that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate serves as a signal that is both necessary and sufficient for receptor activation of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane in these cells.\r"

  ".U": "91296030\r", 
  ".W": "Several hundred million tons of toxic mercurials are dispersed in the biosphere. Microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (MerA). The latter, a homodimer with homology to the FAD-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction NADPH + Hg(II)----NADP+ + H+ + Hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates. Human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for FAD-dependent disulphide reductases and between its primary structure and that of MerA from Tn501 (Pseudomonas), Tn21 (Shigella), p1258 (Staphylococcus) and Bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved. All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini. Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp. strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. We report here the crystal structure of MerA from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp. strain RC607. Analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor Cd(II) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor. Knowledge of the mode of mercury ligation is a prerequisite for understanding this unique detoxification mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "91296031\r", 
  ".W": "An example of two related enzymes that catalyse similar reactions but possess different active sites is provided by comparing the structure of Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase with glutathione reductase. Both are dimeric enzymes that catalyse the reduction of disulphides by pyridine nucleotides through an enzyme disulphide and a flavin. Human glutathione reductase contains four structural domains within each molecule: the flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD)- and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-binding domains, the 'central' domain and the C-terminal domain that provides the dimer interface and part of the active site. Although both enzymes share the same catalytic mechanism and similar tertiary structures, their active sites do not resemble each other. We have determined the crystal structure of E. coli thioredoxin reductase at 2 A resolution, and show that thioredoxin reductase lacks the domain that provides the dimer interface in glutathione reductase, and forms a completely different dimeric structure. The catalytically active disulphides are located in different domains on opposite sides of the flavin ring system. This suggests that these enzymes diverged from an ancestral nucleotide-binding protein and acquired their disulphide reductase activities independently.\r"

Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels remained within normal limits in all patients, and there has been no nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. There has been 1 infection among the 65 patients (1%) to date. It occurred in a patient who had a previously treated local infection. Cranioplasty, vertebral body replacement, or spinal fusion with tobramycin-impregnated methylmethacrylate is safe and may reduce the incidence of infection.\r"

  ".W": "A new computed tomographic-stereotactic device that translates the operating point onto preoperative computed tomographic (CT) images, the Neuronavigator, has been developed. We have applied this system to various neurosurgical procedures to examine its usefulness. The system consists of a 6-joint sensing arm and a 16-bit personal computer. It projects the location of the arm tip onto a corresponding CT slice with a cursor that guides the surgeon toward the intracranial target during open surgery. The system also projects the location of the tip onto angiograms, and when used in conjunction with echography or a transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow meter, the surgeon's ability to navigate is enhanced. Sixty-eight patients underwent operation with the Neuronavigator. The navigation system worked as the core of a multimodal three-dimensional data base that proved to be useful during surgery. The maximum detection error was 2.5 mm, which was considered sufficient for open microsurgery. It also proved useful in designing the position of a craniotomy, in targeting deep-seated mass lesions, and in tracing the tumor edge, which had been identified on a CT scan. When the angiogram was combined with the navigator, it became easy to identify key vessels within a small operating field. The system was also combined with a TCD flow meter. This combination makes it possible to translate the measuring point of the TCD directly into CT coordinates, improving the precision of location of the TCD probe. The Neuronavigator combines various diagnostic images into one database and effectively guides the surgeon during surgery.\r"

This report presents a simple yet precise, alternative method, using the basic Brown-Roberts-Wells or Cosman-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame, for placement of visual markers to aid in tumor resections. The method can also be extended to the Leksell system. Using routine computed tomographic scanning or magnetic resonance imaging after stereotactic frame application, multiple points along tumor edges were used as target points. In the operating room, standard techniques were used for the skin incision, removal of the bone flap, and opening the dura. At each target point, after opening the dura and using stereotactic coordinates and equipment, a microbiopsy forceps was used to place \"micropatties\" (each with a string tail) or small catheters with pledgets or catheter tips located at tumor edges. After removing the arc, the tumor resection was accomplished in a conventional nonstereotactic manner by simply following string tails or catheters to the tumor. Gross tumor edges were determined from positions of actual patties or catheter tips. These simple but accurate techniques offer the possibility of tumor resections under stereotactic guidance with equipment readily available to most neurosurgeons. The fidelity of marker placement is also maintained in relation to tumor edges despite shifts in the tumor and/or brain as cystic areas are drained or large amounts of the tumor are resected.\r"

In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the aneurysm could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the aneurysm in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75%. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and cerebral vasospasm were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively. In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified. We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications.\r"

In the lower range of autoregulation, that is, at perfusion pressures between 80 and 40 mm Hg and even lower, the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral blood flow showed a strong correlation (0.86) under conditions of standard pCO2 (PaCO2 = 35 +/- 2 mm Hg). Autoregulation was exhausted at 40 mm Hg, and the cerebrovascular resistance was minimal. Below this perfusion pressure, the cerebral blood flow and volume dropped sharply, whereas the cerebrovascular resistance gradually increased, indicating that, despite the maximally dilated resistance vessels, intracranial hypertension causes vascular resistance to increase, possibly via blocking of the venous outflow. Our results confirmed that noninvasive and easily (even at bedside) applicable measurements of changes in cerebral blood flow velocity could be a substitute for the cumbersome and expensive isotope measurements of cerebral blood flow in patients with intracranial hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was carried out in 24 patients with pituitary macroadenomas (32 studies) to assess the glucose utilization of these tumors in vivo. The adenoma metabolic index, which is the ratio of FDG uptake of tumor to a whole brain slice, was calculated. Comparisons were made between tumor uptake of FDG and hormone secretion and response to therapies. In each positron emission tomography study, the macroadenoma could be easily identified visually as an area of increased FDG uptake near the region of the sella. FDG uptakes were highest for nonfunctional adenomas, and the prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone-producing groups displayed similar levels of glucose metabolism. The adenoma metabolic index for all tumors averaged 1.3, ranging from 0.3 for a thyroid-stimulating hormone adenoma to 3.5 for a nonfunctional tumor. Tumors did not exhibit metabolic rates that could characterize the type of hormone produced. Recurrent macroadenomas displayed metabolism similar to tumors not operated on, whereas irradiated adenomas showed lower glucose uptake than nonirradiated tumors. Drug therapy with bromocriptine or the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide also decreased the glucose utilization of the tumor. There was no correlation between the amount of hormone produced and the adenoma metabolic index when a group of tumors was analyzed. Patients scanned more than once, however, demonstrated changes in hormone levels that changed or did not change in parallel with tumor metabolism. Thus, positron emission tomography offers the potential capability for predicting and defining the growth of pituitary adenomas. This may be of particular value when plasma hormone assays and conventional imaging techniques prove inadequate for monitoring patient response to therapy.\r"
