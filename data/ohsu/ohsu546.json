Female subjects were tested for HIV-1 antibody (enzyme immunoassay [EIA] and Western blot), HIV-1 serum antigen, HIV-1 DNA gag sequences by the polymerase chain reaction, and HIV-1 virus isolation from peripheral mononuclear cells. Twenty-two of 23 (96%) women were negative by all HIV-1 assays. One woman was positive by all the HIV-1 assays including an EIA screening test for HIV-1 antibody. These preliminary results suggest that the frequency of HIV-1 infection in antibody-negative sexual partners of HIV-1 infected individuals is probably very low.\r"

In Canada 2% of all blood donors, or approximately 25,000 individuals annually attempt to make a blood donation but are deferred because their Hb level does not meet these minimum accepted standards. In a previous study we provided a biostatistical approach to ascertain objectively the optimal minimum Hb standards for blood donors to best discriminate between iron deficient and non iron deficient individuals. The derived values were lower than the existing minimum Hb standards and because of concern that blood donors accepted using these lower Hb standards might have asymptomatic disease, the proposed new levels were not adopted. This present prospective study was undertaken to assess the impact on the blood donors of the new Hb standards. Over 26 months we evaluated 1,558 donors (695 males and 863 females). On entry into the study they were screened for a variety of medical conditions which could result in asymptomatic anemia and 6 months later they answered a health questionnaire. Blood donors were entered into 1 of 3 groups. Group I were donors accepted by the existing criteria. Group II were donors who did not meet the existing Hb criteria but satisfied the newly derived standards. Group III were donors deferred even by the new Hb standards.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure was integrated into office routines without disrupting other patient care. While compliance with fecal occult blood testing was high (88 percent), sensitivity of this test for neoplastic polyps within reach of the proctosigmoidoscope was low (11 percent). These results suggest that acceptance of sigmoidoscopy by patients seen in family physicians' offices could be greater than has been anticipated.\r"

Fifty percent of the respondents consult and refer to as well as receive consultations/referrals from other family physicians. Thirty-five percent of the respondents receive consultations and referrals from other generalist specialists, and 28 percent receive theirs from subspecialists.

Twenty-one (87.5 percent) of the abnormal smears showed squamous dysplasia; three (12.5 percent) showed squamous atypia. No specific risk factors were identified that predicted the occurrence of an abnormal postpartum Pap following a normal prenatal Pap except for age. Women more than 30 years of age were less likely to have an abnormal postpartum Pap smear (P = 0.008).

The effusion disappeared within a few days after adequate urinary drainage was established, and the infant was remained well since the abnormal urethral valves were fulgurated cystoscopically. Review of the clinical and experimental literature reveals no consensus about how pleural fluid accumulates in the presence of obstructive uropathy, and this neonate showed a direct inverse relation between the amount of pleural fluid drainage and urinary output via catheter. Hydronephrosis should be considered diagnostically when a newborn has a pleural effusion that is otherwise unexplained.\r"

Typical anginal pain developed in all patients during pacing tachycardia before but not after nifedipine. Postpacing increases in end-diastolic pressure (10 +/- 5 [mean +/- standard deviation] to 23 +/- 9 mm Hg) and volume (99 +/- 29 to 113 +/- 27 ml) were greatly attenuated with nifedipine (13 +/- 7 and 97 +/- 22 ml, respectively). These responses were associated with normalization of postpacing shifts of the ventricular diastolic pressure-volume curve upward or more to the right. The time constant of ventricular relaxation was prolonged by pacing tachycardia (44 +/- 10 to 62 +/- 5 ms) and was reduced to the control level in postpacing beats after nifedipine. The peak rate of early ventricular filling was affected neither by pacing stress nor by nifedipine. When regional myocardial function was expressed by a radial coordinate system, the nonischemic segment responded to the control pacing with an increase in end-diastolic length and comparable augmentation of the stroke excursion, while the ischemic segment showed a marked reduction in stroke excursion with end-diastolic length unchanged. Thus, the diastolic pressure-length relation moved up to the higher portion of the single curve in the nonischemic segment, while it shifted directly upward in the ischemic segment. These responses were markedly attenuated with nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coronary angiography was performed an average of 1.7 days from admission and an average of 24 hours from last symptoms of chest pain in patients with unstable angina. Angiographic studies were analyzed for evidence of coronary thrombus (intraluminal filling defects) at significant stenoses in patent vessels or thrombus at sites of total occlusion) and for coronary lesion morphology suggesting a complex or acute lesion (irregular or ill-defined margins, inhomogeneity, haziness or ulceration). Angiographic evidence of coronary thrombus was present in 40 of 69 patients (58%) with unstable angina: 31 (45%) had intraluminal filling defects and 9 (13%) had thrombotic total occlusion with well-developed collaterals present. Only 1 of 20 patients (5%) with stable angina had evidence of thrombus (p less than 0.001). Complex lesions were present in 18 other unstable patients (26%) and in 2 other patients (10%) with stable angina who did not have angiographic evidence of thrombus. Overall, 58 of 69 patients (84%) with unstable angina had morphologic findings suggesting an acute process (thrombus or complex lesion) compared with 3 of 20 patients (15%) with stable angina, p less than 0.0001. Thus, unstable angina is associated with a high prevalence of angiographic coronary thrombus and complex lesions suggesting an acute process, in contrast to stable angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A study of whether reperfusion accelerates cell death was performed in 35 pig hearts without collateral circulation. In 15 animals, the distal one-third of the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 1 hour followed by 1-, 3-, or 7-hour reperfusion in 5 animals each. As controls, 5 hearts each were examined after 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours of occlusion of the artery without reperfusion. Heart rate and aortic pressure before and during occlusion and reperfusion did not change in any group. The subepicardial and subendocardial regional blood flow decreased to almost zero in all hearts after occlusion (85 +/- 1 to 2 +/- 2) but recovered during reperfusion (65 +/- 15 ml/100 g/min). Specimens were histologically examined by an enzyme method using nitrotetrazolium blue, an immunohistochemical method using myoglobin antibody, by staining with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome. In the control hearts, clear demarcation of the infarct area was observed 4 hours after occlusion. However, in the reperfusion group, clear demarcation of the infarct was seen after 1-hour reperfusion, namely, 2 hours after the onset of infarct. Demarcation was seen not only in the tissue with contraction band necrosis, but also in the tissue with coagulation necrosis. Therefore, it is concluded that reperfusion accelerates cell death due to both contraction band necrosis and coagulation necrosis.\r"

In a morphometric study of 33 additional hearts of patients without a clinical history of hypertension, valvular disease or diabetes mellitus, 15 of which had anterior infarction, a positive correlation (r = 0.63) was observed between myocyte diameter and the percent area of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the left ventricle. In the heart of patients with severe coronary stenosis (more than 75% luminal narrowing), the regression coefficient was 0.83. The hearts of 8 patients with nontransmural infarction showed a strong correlation between myocyte diameter and fibrosis, compared with the hearts of 7 patients with transmural infarction. In most cases, the main mechanism of hypertrophy in ischemic heart disease was considered to be compensatory hypertrophy for existence of myocardial fibrosis.\r"

Five of 36 consecutive pigs before endothelial denudation showed evidence of regional hyperconstriction after intracoronary administration of histamine (group 1). Histologic examination revealed intimal thickening along the spastic site. Because 5 pigs died during endothelial denudation, cholesterol feeding was randomly assigned to 13 of the remaining 26 pigs (group 2) and others were fed a regular low cholesterol diet (group 3) for 3 months. Regional coronary hyperconstriction was also evident after intracoronary administration of histamine at the site of denudation, and the degree of constriction was 78 +/- 3 and 74 +/- 4% in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Because the intimal thickening was confirmed at the site of spasm in groups 2 and 3, spontaneous as well as denudation-induced intimal thickening accompanied the enhanced responsiveness to histamine, irrespective of the level of serum cholesterol. However, the role of geometry on histamine-induced luminal narrowing was only 6% and was not physiologically significant. Augmented responses of the coronary artery to histamine, but not to phenylephrine or potassium chloride were reproduced in the nonbeating isolated heart preparations perfused at 90 mm Hg with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution, and the degree and location of in vitro hyperconstriction were similar to that in vivo and were not attenuated after pretreatment with the nerve transmitter blockers, guanethidine (3 X 10(-6) M), atropine (10(-6) M) and tetrodotoxin (3 X 10(-7) M). Accordingly, spasm can be provoked without the influence of blood constituents and neural factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of afterload elevation on the ischemic myocardium was examined in an isolated, paced canine heart with a partial coronary stenosis. The coronary blood flow of the left circumflex coronary artery was reduced to approximately one-third of the values before stenosis. The left circumflex coronary stenosis produced a decrease in global ventricular function, a decrease in systolic shortening and deviation of the ST-segment of the epicardial electrocardiogram and an increase in myocardial carbon dioxide (CO2) tension of the ischemic region. Then, afterload elevation with constant preload decreased the myocardial CO2 tension and improved the ST-segment deviation of the ischemic myocardium. Mechanical function, estimated by the relation between mean aortic pressure and systolic shortening, also improved with elevation of mean aortic pressure. In contrast, afterload elevation combined with preload elevation did not improve ischemic injury, as estimated by myocardial CO2 tension, and did not improve ST-segment deviation or mechanical function despite an increase in left circumflex coronary flow. These results suggest that the elevation of afterload pressure under constant preload improves ischemia produced by a partial coronary stenosis due to increased coronary blood supply; however, the preload elevation counterbalances the beneficial effects of afterload elevation.\r"

Arteriovenous lactate and hypoxanthine showed peak differences during the reactive hyperemia after the first 2 occlusions which did not increase after subsequent occlusions. Within minutes after the procedure, lactate and hypoxanthine efflux was no longer seen, demonstrating the reversibility of the metabolic disturbances after repeated ischemia. The results of this study indicate that there is no permanent alteration in lactate or hypoxanthine metabolism after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with 4 coronary occlusions of 40 to 60 seconds' duration, with a total occlusion time of 192 +/- 40 seconds.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that regional asynchrony due to acute ischemia disturbs the exponential nature of left ventricular (LV) pressure reduction and may alter the pattern of (-)dP/dt upstroke curve. If LV pressure decreases exponentially during the isovolumic relaxation period (P = Ae-t/T + B, where A and B = constants, t = time and T = time constant), the (-)dP/dt upstroke curve should also be exponential and upward-convex because dP/dt = A(-t/T)e-t/T. To test this theory in humans, the LV (-)dP/dt upstroke curve was analyzed in 9 normal subjects, 12 patients with effort angina pectoris (AP) and 15 with old myocardial infarction (MI) under the basal conditions. The (-)dP/dt upstroke was convex-upward in all normal subjects, but convex-downward in 9 of 12 patients with AP and in all patients with MI, which suggests nonexponential decrease in LV pressure in the groups with AP and MI. The dP/dt (20/60), which is the ratio of the (-)dP/dt value at 20 ms after peak (-)dP/dt to that at 60 ms after peak (-)dP/dt, was significantly lower in the group with AP (1.70 +/- 0.07) and in the group with MI (1.61 +/- 0.13) than in normal subjects (2.08 +/- 0.18) (p less than 0.005). This indicates that (-)dP/dt upstroke 20 to 60 ms after peak (-)dP/dt increases more slowly in the groups with AP and MI than in normal subjects. Theoretical consideration showed that such a slower increase of the upstroke resulted from impaired early to midrelaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion-induced calcium gain provides a marker of irreversible injury, but whether the cells gain calcium because of irreversible injury caused by the ischemic episode, or whether it is the reperfusion-induced calcium gain that triggers the irreversible injury has yet to be established. Using isolated rat hearts made ischemic for either 30 or 60 minutes, and reperfusing with Krebs-Henseleit buffer or Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing either 2,3-butanedione monoxime (to inhibit contractile activity) or 2,4-dinitrophenol or nitrogen-gassed substrate-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer (to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation), the effect of reperfusion was monitored in terms of calcium gain and ultrastructural changes including loss of sarcolemmal integrity. The results establish that the routes of calcium entry during postischemic reperfusion are complex. The calcium gain can occur in the absence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and is modulated by interventions introduced at the moment of reperfusion which affect the contractile state. There are at least 2 routes of calcium entry: contraction-dependent and contraction independent. The former is probably associated with the development of sarcolemmal discontinuities. The results also establish that when sarcolemmal integrity has been destroyed, the cells can gain excess calcium under conditions that prevent mitochondrial calcium uptake. Accordingly, the mitochondria cannot be the only intracellular organelles that accumulate calcium under these conditions. Additional studies are needed to identify the other sites of calcium binding under conditions of adenosine triphosphate deprivation.\r"

In all patients typical anginal pain developed during pacing tachycardia, and in the postpacing beat, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 14 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation, p less than 0.01), relaxation time constant increased from 44 +/- 9 to 59 +/- 7 ms (p less than 0.01) and ejection fraction diminished from 63.1 +/- 9.1 to 52.8 +/- 10.8% (p less than 0.01). However, peak rate of early left ventricular filling obtained from frame-by-frame analysis of left ventriculograms did not change significantly. The time difference from segmental peak lengthening to left ventricular peak filling increased significantly in the ischemic segment (32 +/- 30 vs 77 +/- 49 ms, p less than 0.05). Chamber stiffness constant of a viscoelastic model increased significantly from 0.0177 +/- 0.01 to 0.0354 +/- 0.015 (p less than 0.01) without change in chamber viscosity constant. In the ischemic segment, peak rate of lengthening decreased by 45% with ischemia, and peak rate of lengthening normalized for the end-diastolic segment length by 36%. However, peak rate of lengthening normalized for the extent of systolic shortening did not change. The control segment showed a tendency to increase in these 3 parameters, but the changes were not statistically significant. Thus, peak rate of segmental myocardial lengthening decreased with ischemia because of a decrease in segmental shortening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its prevalence overall remained approximately 30% at each recording time but with marked individual variability in appearance. Late potential activity was associated with late ventricular arrhythmias (greater than 24 hours after AMI) but not with early ventricular arrhythmias (less than 24 hours after AMI). Late ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death occurred only in the 6 patients with late potential activity (p less than 0.05). Early ventricular fibrillation (15 patients) occurred equally in the patients with and without late potential activity. Thus, late potential activity occurs at some stage in the first 6 weeks after AMI in 50% of patients, but its timing is variable. It is a sensitive but not specific predictor of late ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, but not of early ventricular fibrillation.\r"

To study the effectiveness of serial changes in enzyme activity in specimens taken at presentation and 8 hours later in establishing the likelihood of AMI, the results in 1,214 patients with acute cardiac symptoms of less than 24 hours' duration were retrospectively evaluated. In 1,007 patients with initially normal creatine kinase (CK), an increase in CK (positive delta-CK) occurred in 98% of patients with AMI and 16% of patients without AMI. In 196 patients with elevated total CK, a low ratio of CK to aspartate aminotransferase was found in 98% of patients with AMI and 33% of patients without AMI. These 2 enzyme ratios had a sensitivity greater than 90% in patients with typical and atypical histories. The overall predictive value of serial enzyme measurements for AMI was 53%, compared with 18% in patients selected for admission. These results suggest that serial enzyme measurements could be used in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected AMI, and have the potential to reduce the number of patients admitted to coronary care units who do not have AMI.\r"

Fluctuations in coronary blood supply due to dynamic changes in coronary vasomotor tone are believed to be responsible for this variation in angina threshold. Cutaneous cold application produces an inappropriate increase in coronary vascular resistance in patients with CAD. To assess the effect of a coronary vasoconstrictor stimulus during exercise (when there are competitive stimuli for coronary dilatation), 16 men with documented CAD and angina underwent 2 exercise tolerance tests, 1 performed for control purposes and the other during cold application (hand and forearm immersed in ice). The cold pressor test elicited an increase in systolic blood pressure at rest (134 vs 159 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) at the end of stage I (145 vs 165 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) and at peak exercise (154 vs 166 mm Hg, p less than 0.05).

Eight patients had 2 ventriculograms and the mean ejection fraction remained unchanged (only 2 patients had greater than 5% decrease in ejection fraction between the 2 examinations). Spontaneous occlusion of high degree coronary artery stenoses is not unusual and is usually well tolerated, presumably due to the development of collateral circulation.\r"

The 20-year follow-up involved 2,633 presumably healthy subjects, 1,308 men and 1,325 women, aged 25 to 69 years at the beginning of the study in 1964. Variables determined at entry examination included total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index and cigarette smoking. During the 20-year period there were 242 fatal and nonfatal definite coronary events in men, and 108 in women. All variables differed in varying degrees between subjects who did and did not have a definite coronary event. Three multiple logistic regression models revealed that among these variables the most important was HDL-cholesterol percentage, which significantly improved the regression, even after total cholesterol was included with all other risk factors. With the first model, goodness-of-fit tests indicated that predicted values fit the observed values well, even after the first step, if HDL-cholesterol percentage is entered. The second and third models significantly fit the predicted values only after entering the HDL-cholesterol percentages. This means that although all the other variables, including total cholesterol, differed significantly between the affected and nonaffected groups, they were insufficient predictors alone. The results reveal that HDL-cholesterol percentage had the highest predictive value for risk of future coronary disease; it significantly improved the predictive capability of the logistic regression model, even after adjustment for all other mentioned variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A major reservation relates to the issue of reproducibility of arrhythmia provocation. This prospective study comprised 28 patients referred for evaluation of ventricular arrhythmia. In half of these subjects the clinical arrhythmia was sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Maximal exercise testing adhering to a Bruce protocol was performed on 2 separate days. No antiarrhythmic drugs were administered at the time of testing. Of the 28 patients, 27 had an increase in arrhythmia with exercise. The prevalence rates of arrhythmia were greater than 80% and did not significantly differ between test 1 and test 2. Excluding infrequent single ventricular premature complexes, the reproducibility of a test with positive outcome was 76%. Similarly, test-retest agreement, a bidirectional measure of reproducibility, was greater than 74%. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.26 to 0.36 for all grades of arrhythmia, indicating that reproducibility was consistently greater than by chance alone. Linear regression analysis of arrhythmia frequency in the 2 tests yielded R values of 0.76 to 0.96 and slopes of 0.82 to 1.2. No patient had enough spontaneous variability in repetitive forms to suggest spurious efficacy or aggravation. For ventricular premature complexes there was an 8 to 14% incidence of spurious efficacy and a 4 to 7% incidence of spurious aggravation. These results suggest that exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmia is sufficiently reproducible to serve as an adjunct method in the evaluation and management of patients with potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Anthropometric and serum albumin assessment of nutritional status was compared with hemodynamic, echocardiographic and serum chemistry evaluation in 48 patients with severe CHF (ejection fraction 0.17 +/- 0.05). Malnutrition, as defined by decreases in percent body fat determined from skinfold thicknesses, weight/height index or serum albumin, was present in 24 of 48 (50%) patients, who did not differ from the 24 well-nourished patients in cardiac index (1.9 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (30 +/- 6 vs 27 +/- 10 mm Hg), but had higher right atrial pressure (16 +/- 5 vs 9 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and more severe tricuspid regurgitation by semiquantitative Doppler grading on a 0 to 3 scale (2.0 +/- 0.9 vs 0.9 +/- 0.8, p less than 0.01). Right atrial pressure was the only independent hemodynamic predictor of malnutrition (p less than 0.0002). Malnourished patients had lower serum sodium (134 +/- 4 vs 139 +/- 4 mEq/liter, p less than 0.01) and total triiodothyronine levels (89 +/- 30 vs 115 +/- 26 ng/dl, p less than 0.01) and higher creatinine levels (1.6 +/- 0.7 vs 1.2 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.03). None of the other biochemical markers of nutritional status differed between the groups except lower serum triglyceride levels (115 +/- 73 vs 186 +/- 97 mg/dl, p less than 0.05) in malnourished patients. Malnutrition is common in patients with severe CHF and is associated with increased right atrial pressure and tricuspid regurgitation.\r"

Malnutrition is common in the elderly and may adversely affect surgical outcome. To determine the effect of hypoalbuminemia on postoperative complications, 92 patients greater than or equal to 75 years (range 75 to 90) undergoing a variety of major cardiac surgical procedures were evaluated. Thirteen patients (14%) had a serum albumin level less than 3.5 g/dl preoperatively. Compared to patients with normal albumin, hypoalbuminemic patients had an increased frequency of postoperative confusion, congestive heart failure, low cardiac output, renal dysfunction and gastrointestinal complications (all p less than 0.05). Mean postoperative length of stay was markedly prolonged in these patients (27 vs 12 days; p less than 0.001), and mortality also tended to be higher (31 vs 13%; p = 0.11). Using multivariate analysis, albumin less than 3.5 g/dl was the most powerful predictor of postoperative renal dysfunction (p less than 0.01), and was also an independent predictor of increased length of stay (p less than 0.01) and gastrointestinal disorders (p less than 0.05). Thus, hypoalbuminemia is a powerful indicator of an increased risk of perioperative complications in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Increased attention to nutritional factors is warranted in these patients.\r"

Loss of fat-free mass as measured by densitometry was 1.2 +/- 0.8 kg. Changes in body weight and fat-free mass measured by densitometry did not differ significantly and were significantly different from zero. Reduction of fat-free mass as determined by bioelectrical impedance was 0.5 +/- 0.8 kg, which was significantly different from body-weight loss and loss of fat-free mass as measured by densitometry but not significantly different from zero.

The formulae often used to estimate caloric support to meet MEE are based on body weight, predicted resting metabolic rate (RMR), body surface area, or the total body surface area burned (BSAB). These predictive equations originate from studies of less than or equal to 30 patients generally lacking measurements beyond the third week of convalescence. We report 565 measurements by indirect calorimetry for 122 adults between the burn day and day 149 postburn. A standardized protocol of nutritional support and early wound closure was followed. Predictions of MEE are compared in subcategories of BSAB (2-25%; 30-50%; 51-75%; and 76-98%). For major burns exceeding 30% BSAB, 2X the predicted RMR was consistently closest to the measured MEE, assuring adequate calorie provision while minimizing the risk of overfeeding.\r"

Prolactin was not stimulated by any of the aspartame meals, aspartic acid, or 0.3 g phenylalanine; a small rise in serum prolactin, similar to that produced by a high-protein mixed meal, followed ingestion of 1.0 g phenylalanine. Serum growth hormone showed no statistically significant changes in response to any of the experimental meals whereas cortisol and insulin fell slightly and glucose rose slightly during each of the meals.

In multiple correlation analysis, intakes of protein and fat were positively correlated with A, T, and FT, whereas the intakes of carbohydrate, grain, total fiber, and grain fiber showed the opposite correlations. Protein intake was positively correlated with percentage FT (%FT) and negatively with SHBG. BC patients had a similar pattern to omnivores with even higher levels of A and T (significant compared with vegetarians) and they showed significantly higher FT and lower SHBG than both control groups.

The disappearance of an intravenous bolus of Intralipid was faster in athletes (5.4 +/- 1.2%/min) than in sedentary men (4.3 +/- 0.8%/min, p less than 0.01). The half-life of chylomicron-TG was shorter in athletes (3.0 +/- 0.8 min) than in sedentary men (4.0 +/- 1.0 min, p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that chronic exercise decreases postprandial lipemia by reducing chylomicron-TG's half-life. This effect is due partly to reduced fasting serum TG pool size and partly to a direct effect of exercise on the serum TG removal system.\r"

Despite a modest increase of insulin-mediated glucose disposal at physiologic insulinemia during the high P:S diet, no influence was seen on glycemic control, and on blood glucose, plasma insulin, and C peptide responses to mixed meals. In conclusion, a linoleic-enriched diet in patients with NIDD causes a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile but does not influence glycemic control and carbohydrate tolerance.\r"

First, to separate whey proteins from casein, different variables such as low- or high-speed centrifugation at different temperatures with or without adjustment of pH to 4.6 or 4.3 and with or without addition of calcium to whole milk or skim milk were tested. Each variable was evaluated by gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. The optimum method for a discrete separation of whey and casein is the adjustment of whole milk to pH 4.3 with addition of 60 mmol calcium/L, followed by ultracentrifugation. Rapid and sensitive separation and analysis of whey proteins was achieved by FPLC gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography.\r"

Evaluations of gustatory function (threshold sensitivity, perceived intensity of suprathreshold stimuli, preferences) were conducted on 28 chronic ST users and 30 nonusers after both abstaining and using ST. Subjects also maintained 7-d dietary records that included descriptions of the predominant taste qualities of foods. There were few user vs nonuser differences in gustatory measures. Among nonusers, use of ST reduced perceived intensity of salty, sour, and bitter stimuli. Users reported greater alcohol intakes and lower consumption of carbohydrates, sweet foods, fruits, and grains. Chronic use of ST does not appear to have substantial effects on gustatory function but may be associated with decreased carbohydrate intakes, perhaps related to increased alcohol use and possibly because of reduced consumption of sweet-tasting foods.\r"

Similar studies in hyperlipidemic subjects demonstrated that the plasma and the chylomicron fraction from lipoprotein lipase-deficient patients (with elevated chylomicrons) contained both tocopherols up to 24 h, whereas plasma from a patient with dysbetalipoproteinemia (with elevated beta very-low-density lipoproteins) displayed the decrease in gamma-tocopherol at 24 h. These studies demonstrate that both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols are absorbed and secreted by the intestine in chylomicrons, and suggest that alpha-tocopherol is preferentially secreted by the liver in nascent lipoproteins. Furthermore, studies in post-gall bladder surgery patients suggest a preferential secretion of gamma-tocopherol in bile. Thus, the liver rather than the intestine appears to discriminate between alpha- and gamma-tocopherols.\r"

The ingestion of the milk or Ca supplements had no overall effect on Ca retention by these subjects because the milk and supplements depressed apparent absorption of Ca in the gut and fractional tubular reabsorption of Ca in the kidneys. Supplementation of the diet with CaCl and to a lesser extent with milk significantly increased renal acid excretion whereas supplementation with CaCO3 depressed renal acid excretion. The three Ca supplements significantly altered magnesium and phosphorus absorption and urinary excretion in different manners but had no overall effect on retention of P or Mg. The responses of our subjects to these treatments may be different than those of subjects who are chronically in negative balance in regard to Ca.\r"

Values of bone mineral content (BMC), bone width (BW), and bone mineral density (BMD) were obtained. An intermediate or high lifetime Ca (greater than 500 mg/d) was significantly associated with a greater DisBMC (p = 0.0031), DisBMD (p = 0.0031), MidBMC (p = 0.0015), and MidBMD (p = 0.0015) when adjusted for PA. Similarly, with Ca adjusted for, a high lifetime PA (greater than or equal to 45 min of moderate to strenuous activity four times a week) was significantly associated with greater DisBMC (p = 0.0032), DisBMD (p = 0.0022), MidBMC (p = 0.0012), MidBW (p = 0.0173), and MidBMD (p = 0.0546). These findings suggest important roles for both adequate Ca intake and PA habits in enhancing peak adult skeletal mass and a trade-off between these two variables, when each was intermediate or higher.\r"

The inhibitory effect of bran on Fe absorption was compared between a group of strict vegetarians with a regular high phytate intake and a control group by use of wheat rolls with and without bran labeled with 55Fe and 59Fe. The average individual decrease of the Fe absorption from adding the bran was 92 and 93% in the two groups, respectively. No intestinal adaptation to a high phytate intake could be observed.

Liquid-formula meals were prepared from hydrolyzed maize starch, corn oil, and either spray-dried egg white or a milk-protein product. In meals containing egg white, 3.32% of the Fe was dialyzable. The substitution of casein and whey protein products reduced the dialyzable fraction to 0.19-0.56% and 0.86-1.60%, respectively. Percentage Fe absorption was also reduced by the substitution of casein or whey protein for egg white. Mean absorption values fell from 6.67 to 3.65% and 2.53 to 0.98%, respectively. When the intact milk-protein products were replaced by enzyme- or acid-hydrolyzed preparations, the dialyzable fraction increased markedly and in proportion to the extent of hydrolysis. A similar but much smaller effect on absorption was observed. These studies suggest that bovine casein and whey proteins are responsible at least in part for the poor bioavailability of the Fe in some infant formulas.\r"

A three-variable model called the MCV model was used to assess impaired Fe status. Prevalences based on the MCV model did not differ between Hispanic groups. Differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanics occurred only among 20-44-y-old females, where MAs had a higher prevalence than NHWs or NHBs.

Linear relationships with extent of drinking were also sought. Drinkers were found to be less obese than abstainers. Consumption of carbohydrate, vitamins, calcium, fruits, fruit juices, and raw vegetables was greater among abstainers whereas consumption of fat (particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids), cholesterol, zinc, meat, pickled vegetables, and dried fish was greater among drinkers. Because validations of dietary questionnaires have shown that alcohol consumption is more accurately recalled than food intake, the possibility of a residual confounding effect for these dietary variables should be considered in epidemiologic studies of alcohol and health.\r"

  ".W": "In 80 patients with primary superficial bladder carcinoma Tumor Nodes Metastasis (TNM classification: stages Ta and T1) with adequate follow-up of at least four years, the value of selective nuclear morphometry and DNA flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded material in addition to classic prognosticators was assessed. Only the quantitative techniques appeared to be valuable predictors of new tumor occurrence. The recurrence rate in patients with large nuclei (mean nuclear area greater than 95 micron 2; n = 29) and in aneuploid cases (n = 30) was significantly higher (Wilcoxon: P = 0.05 and P = 0.0001) than in those with small nuclei (mean nuclear area less than = 95 micron 2; n = 51) and diploid cases (n = 50). The prevalence of large nuclei and aneuploidy also appeared useful to predict progressive recurrence, i.e., grade 3 or/and muscle invasive carcinoma (TNM classification: stages T2-T4) (chi-square: P less than 0.0001). Clinical follow-up showed that only 62.1% of the cases with large nuclei remained free of progressive recurrence, compared with 92.2% of those with small nuclei (Mantel-Cox: P less than 0.0001). For the aneuploid and diploid cases, these figures came to 53.3% and 98% (Mantel-Cox: P less than 0.0001). By multivariate analysis DNA ploidy was selected as the best discriminator. None of the classic prognosticators, including histologic grade, had additional prognostic value. Also, morphometry did not add to the prognosis prediction, which can be explained by the considerable overlapping between the prevalence of large nuclei and aneuploidy (24 of 29 and 30 cases, respectively). These findings practically suggest that patients presenting with superficial carcinoma with large nuclei (mean nuclear area greater than 95 microns 2) or aneuploid DNA values should be treated more aggressively.\r"

The fourth was associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation, Chiari type II. In the CSF samples from the patients with IVH, hemosiderin-laden macrophages were also prominent and, in some cases, were intimately admixed with the PCCs. Immunoperoxidase staining of cytocentrifuge preparations from one of the patients revealed that the PCCs stained with neuron-specific enolase (NSE) but not with pan-leukocyte antibodies. Cells with similar morphologic characteristics to PCCs in the CSF of infants have been infrequently illustrated in the literature and thought to be of hematopoietic origin. However, the immunohistochemical findings and the clinical presentation suggest that PCCs are most likely germinal matrix cells.\r"

A bacterial cause of CD is suspected, but cultivation of a specific pathogen has not been forthcoming. Mollicute-like organisms (MLOs) were recently reported to cause human chronic ocular inflammatory disease. Inoculation of this MLO into mouse eyelids produced chronic progressive granulomatous ocular and orbital inflammatory disease. In addition, MLOs disseminated to produce similar disease in the gut, heart, and lungs. MLOs are noncultivable cell wall-deficient bacterial pathogens. Because they also pass bacteria-retaining 0.450-micron filters, they can be overlooked or confused with viruses. Because MLOs have a characteristic ultrastructural appearance, they can be identified in diseased cells with the use of a transmission electron microscope. MLOs parasitize and destroy leukocytes. They alter the nucleus, replace the cytoplasm, and destroy organelles. MLO-caused disease is treatable by certain antibiotics. This report describes MLO-parasitized vitreous lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes from three patients with CD who had chronic uveitis. The results indicate that MLOs probably caused the uveitis of these patients with CD. The gut as the possible source of the MLO is suggested. Rifampin therapy of Crohn's and MLO-caused disease is discussed.\r"

Analytic precision and accuracy goals have been established, and laboratory performance is monitored periodically. For a laboratory test to be useful, it must be available in a timely manner. Expedience of result reporting has not, however, been routinely included among measures of laboratory quality. The authors evaluated stat and routine turnaround times for 42,414 requests on 24 clinical analytes over a 14-day period with the use of a personal computer. Median turnaround time is 1.70 times faster for stat than for routine tests. When examined by shift, average turnaround time is considerably faster for tests ordered stat than for tests ordered routinely during the day and evening shifts, when the work load is the greatest. The authors are now examining turnaround time as an indicator of quality laboratory performance and efficiency. Computer systems in many clinical laboratories already have the sophistication necessary to perform turnaround time analysis. The authors recommend that clinical laboratories begin to include timeliness of stat and routine result reporting as part of their quality assurance programs. Laboratories may also wish to investigate the usefulness of stat requests during slower shifts because these requests may interrupt the normal flow of specimens without expediting result reporting.\r"

  ".W": "The properties of phospholipase C (PL-C) in the plasma membranes (PM) and the cytosol of osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells, UMR-106, were analyzed to see if separate enzymes or similar enzymes were involved in signalling, transduction, and arachidonate release. The cytosolic PL-C displayed substrate affinities in the order of phosphatidylinositol (PI) greater than phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) or phosphatidylinoisitol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Hydrolysis of PI, PIP, and PIP2 by cytosolic PL-C was not affected by GTP or GTP gamma S and other nucleotides. PI hydrolysis by PM and cytosolic PL-C was undetectable in the presence of 500 microM EGTA and displayed two activity plateaus at various concentrations of Ca2+. The Km for Ca2+ in the PL-C activity of the first plateau was 0.08 microM. Significant hydrolysis of PIP2 by cytosolic PL-C was observed in the absence of Ca2+. In contrast to the enzyme(s) predominant in the cytosol, the order of substrate affinities for PM PL-C was PIP2 greater than PIP greater than PI. Only PIP2 hydrolysis by PM PL-C was stimulated by both GTP and GTP gamma S in a dose-dependent manner. PIP2 hydrolysis by PL-C of the PM was not observed in the absence of Ca2+, serving to further discriminate this enzyme activity from that of the cytosol. PIP2 hydrolysis by PL-C of the PM also was biphasic in the dependence on Ca2+. At resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels, the Vmax of the high affinity activity already had been achieved. Guanine nucleotide stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis by PM PL-C was characterized by increased maximum activity with an unchanged Km for Ca2+ or for PIP2. The pH optimum of PIP2 hydrolysis was similar between cytosolic and PM forms of PL-C. PIP2 hydrolysis with production of IP3 (PL-C activity) in UMR-106 cells treated with [2-3H]-myoinositol was stimulated by PTH, and this stimulation was not inhibited by pertussis toxin. These data suggest that UMR-106 cells possess at least two distinct PL-C activities, one predominant in the cytosol and activated by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ with PI as the substrate. The second enzyme, a GTP-activated PIP2-specific PL-C in the plasma membranes may play an important role in hormone-induced PIP2 hydrolysis mediated through guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and may participate in the hormonal regulation of osteoblast cytosolic Ca2+ and bone remodeling functions.\r"

In an attempt to further clarify this relationship, the authors have studied 17 patients with ADPKD, 9 controls, 9 patients with proven gout and chronic renal failure, 11 patients with gout and normal renal function, and 11 patients with chronic renal failure. The mean serum uric acid concentration was higher in patients with ADPKD as a group than in controls (8.0 +/- 1.7 mg/dl vs. 6.4 +/- 1.6 mg/dl, p less than .02). Clinical gout was identified in 24% of patients with ADPKD; none of the patients with chronic renal failure of other etiologies had gout. Fractional excretion of uric acid and the activity of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) were not different among the groups studied. From this study the authors conclude that ADPKD should be included among those diseases associated with hyperuricemia and gout. A partial deficiency in HGPRT or abnormal renal handling of uric acid do not appear to be responsible for the increased incidence of gout in patients with ADPKD.\r"

None demonstrated marked changes in other liver tests. Only one patient had infection directly involving the hepatobiliary system. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to underlying illnesses, active hepatobiliary diseases, pathogens, bacteremia, or administration of cholestatic drugs. All Group A patients died because of uncontrolled infections, whereas all Group B patients survived with resolution of infection (p less than .001). Ten of 15 patients with available preinfection liver tests demonstrated serial bilirubin increases without marked changes in other liver tests prior to clinical recognition of infection. These findings demonstrate that hyperbilirubinemia disproportionate to increases in other tests may manifest before recognition of infection and that persistent or progressive hyperbilirubinemia is indicative of ongoing active infection.\r"

  ".W": "Increased myocardial contractility was found in the perfused heart isolated from sodium depleted Sprague-Dawley rats. Previously, it was reported that in vitro exposure of different cardiac preparations to low Na+ buffers was associated with both an increased contractility and an increased Ca2+ content in the cells. Therefore, this study was designed to examine increases in ventricular Ca2+ content in the hearts of chronically sodium depleted rats. Two groups of 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. One group (n = 5) received furosemide (5 mg/kg/day IP for 4 days), a low Na+ diet and distilled drinking water for 6 weeks (low sodium plus diuretics group = LSD). The other group (n = 5) received the same low Na+ diet, but 0.5% NaCl was supplemented in drinking water (regular sodium group = RS). Body weight and blood pressure were measured weekly during the dietary period in all rats. At the end of the 6 weeks, heart weight as well as water and electrolyte contents of the heart were measured in all animals. Results showed that both body weight and heart weight were significantly lower in LSD than in RS. Moreover, ventricular Na+ content was reduced while ventricular Ca2+ content was doubled in LSD compared to RS (8.2 +/- 0.2 units vs. 9.2 +/- 0.3 units, p less than .05 and 0.45 +/- 0.13 units vs. 0.23 +/- 0.01 units, p less than .01, respectively). We conclude that in vivo sodium depletion induces an increase in ventricular calcium content; this increased myocardial calcium may be related to the increased in vitro cardiac contractility observed after chronic in vivo sodium depletion, but its distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments needs to be determined.\r"

The authors evaluated patients who could not afford medical care recommended by physicians in a university-affiliated clinic that serves a predominantly indigent population. The authors determined the patients' demographic characteristics, their medical problems, and the types of care for which financial barriers existed. In addition, the authors compared the patients' demographic characteristics and medical illnesses with those of a control group of patients from the clinic who did not experience financial barriers to medical care. Of the 1,950 patients evaluated, 94 (4.8%) were unable to afford care recommended by their physicians. Sixty-seven percent were US citizens, 73% were unemployed, 63% had monthly family incomes of less than $500, and only 33% had health insurance. The patients had a variety of medical problems, ranging from hearing loss, for which they could not obtain hearing aids, to breast masses, for which they could not obtain mammographies or biopsies. When compared to patients who did not experience financial barriers to recommended care, the study patients tended to be poorer, more likely to be undocumented, more likely to be uninsured, and less likely to have acute, self-limited illnesses. Our findings support the argument that the nation's current piecemeal approach to providing indigent health care may lead to serious financial barriers to access in some localities.\r"

Sham-SPLX, SPLX, and SPLX dogs given packed red cells to elevate hematocrit by 30% (SPLX-high hematocrit) received bilateral renal artery obstruction (RAO) for 120 minutes. Renal function was tested for 6 days post-RAO. Hematocrit in the SPLX-high hematocrit group was greater (p less than .05) than the SPLX-RAO group but did not differ from the non-SPLX group. All groups had different (p less than .05) serum creatinine levels for 48 hours post-RAO, and untreated animals differed from all the others at 144 hours. Serum creatinine was highest in untreated, lowest in SPLX-high hematocrit, and intermediate in noninfused SPLX animals. The same pattern was observed in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance and renal histopathology. Fractional excretion of sodium in the SPLX groups was six times that in the intact animals (p less than .05), irrespective of hematocrit level. We conclude that increased hematocrit is protective in ischemic ATN, and does not promote PTC congestion or ATN in the SPLX animal. In addition, the protective effect of splenectomy may be mediated, in part, by mechanism(s) that alter sodium transport or osmolar excretion.\r"

These data suggest that diurnal variation in corneal thickness after radial keratotomy plays a role in diurnal variation of vision in the early postoperative period.\r"

Computer-generated contour lines were similar to the actual cross-sectional contour of plastic cups as photographed by scanning electron microscopy. The magnification error of computer-measured cup diameters was inversely related to the axial length of the model. The slope of this relationship was reduced with the use of either refraction or axial length as a correction factor for magnification error. Of the two correction factors, the former provided the closest estimation of the known diameters in the phakic model, while the latter performed better in the aphakic model.\r"

The authors investigated a specific pattern of cell death called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which is biochemically characterized by a specific pattern of DNA degradation. DNA isolated from endometrium of ovariectomized pseudopregnant rabbits showed a pattern of DNA cleavage at internucleosomal locations. In comparison, DNA from the endometrium of non-ovariectomized animals, as well as several other organs, did not exhibit that pattern. This biochemical evidence supports previous and present morphologic data and correlates with it. Under the experimental conditions used, only the uterine epithelial compartment of the endometrium shows apoptotic cell death, which is absent in the stromal compartment.\r"

The presence of EC in organ cultures was confirmed by the ability of luminal cells to incorporate acetylated-LDL. It was found that incubation of nondenuded organ cultures in 5% fetal bovine serum for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in the mean number of intimal SMC (41.5 +/- 0.9) compared with organ cultures in which the endothelium was removed at the beginning of the experiment (denuded, 15.2 +/- 0.8). Incubation of the latter for 7 days in conditioned medium collected from nondenuded organ cultures also resulted in a significant increase in the mean number of intimal SMC (30.2 +/- 2.2). Incubation of aortic medial SMC cultures in the conditioned medium also enhanced SMC growth. Autoradiography studies at each day of the 7 days showed that intimal SMC proliferation was similar in both nondenuded and denuded organ cultures when the latter was incubated in the conditioned medium. These data suggests that in this model the secretion of a soluble mediator by dysfunctioning, injured, or proliferating endothelial cells stimulates intimal cell proliferation either directly or indirectly.\r"

This study used a library of antibodies to ubiquitin and immunohistochemically examined for the presence of ubiquitin in nonviral intracytoplasmic inclusions that form in different cell types under various pathologic conditions. Membrane-bound lysosomal and nonlysosomal inclusions such as those of storage disease, Russell bodies, alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-fetoprotein as well as nonmembrane-bound inclusions were examined. Ubiquitin epitopes were detected in some of the nonmembrane-bound inclusions only. The ubiquitin-containing inclusions were the Rosenthal fibers, Mallory bodies, Crooke bodies, Lafora bodies, amyloid bodies, and the giant axons of giant axonal neuropathy. Nemaline bodies and the inclusions of juvenile digital fibromatosis, both of which contain actin and actinbinding proteins, did not show immunoreaction. These findings, as well as those of the previous study, show that the presence of ubiquitin in cellular inclusions is selective. The ubiquitin-containing inclusions are not membrane bound; they are fibrillary and most contain also intermediate filament-related proteins. The role of ubiquitin in the formation of these inclusions remains to be elucidated.\r"

Molecular dosimetry studies of formaldehyde and cellular proliferative responses to formaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity have been studied in the rodent and are important components of the authors' ongoing research, which has now been extended to nonhuman primates, a species more analogous to humans. The present study was designed to characterize formaldehyde injury in the respiratory tract of nonhuman primates to provide a direct comparison to the toxic effects of formaldehyde in rodents. Groups of three rhesus monkeys were exposed to room air, or 6 ppm formaldehyde for 5 days per week for 1 or 6 weeks, and the respiratory tract was assessed for nature and extent of histologic responses, and changes in epithelial cell proliferation rate. Lesions were characterized by mild degeneration and early squamous metaplasia confined to specific regions of the transitional and respiratory epithelia of the nasal passages and the respiratory epithelium of the trachea and major bronchi. There was minimal progression of histologic changes between 1 and 6 weeks; however, the percent of nasal surface area affected significantly increased in the 6-week exposure group. Formaldehyde-induced lesions were associated with increases in cell proliferation rates up to 18-fold over controls, which remained significantly elevated after 6 weeks of exposure. Histologic lesions and increases in cell proliferation were most extensive in the nasal passages and were minimal in the lower airways, whereas the maxillary sinuses exhibited no evidence of a response to formaldehyde exposure. Based on the extent of lesions and cell proliferation data, it appears that the monkey is more sensitive than the rat to the acute and subacute effects of formaldehyde at 6 ppm. The absence of response in the maxillary sinuses in the monkey suggests that combining tumors of the nasal cavity and sinuses in epidemiologic studies may not be appropriate for formaldehyde cancer risk assessment. Results of this study also have provided important information for tissue sample site selection in the monkey respiratory tract for ongoing molecular dosimetry studies.\r"

  ".W": "The cytoarchitecture of Peyer's patches that were depleted of their lymphocytes by total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) was examined with particular attention to the effects on M cells in the follicle epithelium and on mononuclear cells in follicle domes underlying the epithelium. Five-month-old, specific pathogen-free Balb/c mice were irradiated with 200-250 rad/day, five times a week to a total dose of 3400-4250, and their Peyer's patches were either fixed for electron microscopy or frozen for immunohistochemistry 1-4 days after completion of irradiation. Control mice were examined at the same time intervals. Follicle domes of TLI mice had approximately one fourth the epithelial surface area of domes of control mice. Within the epithelium, lymphoid cells were virtually depleted after TLI, and yet the epithelium contained M cells. In control mice, most M cells were accompanied by lymphoid cells in invaginations of the apical-lateral cell membrane. In TLI mice, most M cells did not have such apical-lateral invaginations and were columnar shaped. Other than lacking lymphocytes, these cells appeared to be mature M cells. Some M cells did have lymphoid cells or granular mononuclear cells below their basal membranes, adjacent to the basal lamina. Below the epithelium, the proportion of granular mononuclear cells was greatly increased following TLI. The retention of M cells and the increase in proportion of granular mononuclear cells in follicle domes are consistent with selective depletion of lymphocytes following TLI. Persistence of M cells without lymphocytic invaginations after TLI suggests that M cells can differentiate in the absence of, or at least in the presence of very few, lymphocytes, and that invagination by lymphocytes is not necessary to maintain mature M cell morphology.\r"

Basal cells were isolated from the tracheas of adult rabbits using centrifugal elutriation procedures. Such cell isolates that contained greater than 90% basal cells were plated in culture at low cell density to produce individual basal cell clones. Clones were similarly obtained from unfractionated tracheal cells (mixed tracheal cells). Basal cell and mixed cell clones were tested to compare their in vitro growth capacity and their ability to reepithelialize denuded tracheal grafts with a mucociliary epithelium. Both basal cell and mixed cell clones underwent 15 to 20 population doublings in culture. The sizes of their clonogenic cell compartments were roughly similar. When inoculated into denuded tracheal grafts, both types of clones were equally efficient in establishing a mucociliary epithelium. The major secretory cell types observed in tracheas repopulated with the two types of cell clones were cells containing small secretory granules and either rough or smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Goblet cells were seen in approximately 40% of tracheas repopulated with either of the two types of cell clones. It is concluded that in rabbits tracheal basal cells can generate secretory cells with varying morphologic characteristics as well as ciliated cells and may be regarded as epithelial stem cells.\r"

In normal breast tissue as well as in intraductal carcinomas, a more or less continuous basement membrane was observed at the epithelial stromal interface. Unlike laminin and type IV collagen, type VII collagen was not detected in the basement membrane of blood vessels. The keratin 14 antibody stained the basal cell layer of normal ducts and ducts with in situ cancer. In 85% of the invasive carcinomas no basement membrane or basal cells were detected. In 13 cases, however, laminin, type IV collagen, and/or type VII collagen were detected around tumor nests and individual tumor cells. Five of these tumors also showed a positive reaction with the keratin 14 antibody. In five cases keratin 14 expression was found without detectable basement membrane components. It is concluded that 18 of 103 invasive ductal breast carcinomas examined in this study exhibit a basal cell phenotype as determined from the expression of keratin and the deposition of basement membrane components.\r"

Other changes were swollen mitochondria and dilatation, vesiculation, degranulation and intracisternal sequestration of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Apoptosis was the predominant form of cell deletion. By day 10, acinar cellular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were noted. Islets appeared normal. After day 19, the pancreas consisted of ductlike structures embedded in fibrous connective tissue with a minimal inflammatory cell response. These ductlike structures were lined by attenuated to cuboidal, atrophic acinar cells. Many cells contained granular, electron-dense cytoplasmic debris that served as a marker of previous cell damage. This ultrastructural study provides support for a previously proposed theory that ductlike structures (tubular complexes) arise by atrophy and dedifferentiation of acinar cells.\r"

To examine this question, in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was done on routinely processed tissues received in the pathology laboratory to analyze for the presence of GH and PRL messenger RNA (mRNA) in 4 normal pituitaries, 10 prolactinomas, and 16 GH-secreting adenomas. Most acidophilic cells in normal pituitaries expressed either GH or PRL hormone and the respective mRNAs, but GH mRNA and PRL hormone were also detected in some of the same cells. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of prolactinoma had cells with only PRL mRNA in their tumors, while most (14 of 16) patients with a clinical diagnosis of acromegaly or gigantism had both GH and PRL mRNAs in their tumors. The GH adenomas varied in these studies. In situ hybridization was helpful in characterizing the adenoma from a patient with acromegaly who had immunoreactive PRL, but no immunoreactive GH in the resected tumor; in situ hybridization analysis revealed mRNAs for both GH and PRL in the same tumor cells. Our findings indicate that pituitary adenomas from patients with acromegaly commonly express PRL mRNA. It is concluded that in situ hybridization provides new information about the clinical biology and the histopathologic classification of pituitary adenomas.\r"

The results demonstrate that: 1) HBV can be detected reliably only by the use of radiolabeled probes, whereas methods employing nonradioactive probes obviously are not sensitive enough for this virus. The use of 35S-labeled probes shortens the exposure times considerably in comparison to tritiated probes. 2) Biotin-labeled probes are of limited value for in situ hybridization on liver tissues because the presence of endogenous avidin-binding activity often leads to false positive results. 3) Brd-Urd-labeled probes are a useful alternative to biotinylated probes for the detection of CMV. In comparison with biotinylated probes, BrdUrd-labeled probes produce a specific signal of similar staining intensity in the absence of background staining in the liver.\r"

RWP1.1 did not react with normal tissues apart from weak staining of fetal pancreatic ducts. This antibody preferentially reacted with primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas of the colon, stomach, pancreas, and colonic polyps but not with most adenocarcinomas from other sites nor with other types of tumors or cases of chronic pancreatitis. It also reacted with colon adenocarcinomas on frozen sections. The restricted specificity of this antibody could be used in differentiating gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas from other types of tumors including adenocarcinomas from other sites and most pancreatic adenocarcinomas from chronic pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "As macrophages spread on an immune complex-coated surface, large, clear basal vacuoles and numerous coated vesicles and tubules form rapidly and are occasionally contiguous with the adherent surface, creating a microcompartment between the immune complex-coated surface and the cell membrane. The present study explored the nature of this basal compartment by examining the distribution of a major secretory product of macrophages, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and of a lysosomal enzyme, acid phosphatase, by enzyme and immunocytochemistry. Upon contact of the macrophages with the immune complexes, intracellular stores of ApoE were secreted rapidly in the first 10 to 20 minutes to the area of ligand-receptor interaction. ApoE filled the large basal vacuoles and was also found in invaginations on the adherent surface that were sealed to the influx of proteins and peptides from the bulk medium. In contrast, the contents of lysosomes were not redistributed to the basal compartment. By 2 hours most of the ApoE had appeared in the bulk medium, suggesting that the protein could move out of the basal compartment. These data suggest that specific ligand-Fc receptor interactions serve to target secretion by macrophages to selective focal areas of contact, and that there are also mechanisms for retrieval of material from these sites.\r"

The aim of this study was to measure RV function using contrast ventriculography and assess myocardial injury by immunohistochemical evaluation of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and tropomyosin (TROP) as well as by electron microscopy after right coronary occlusion in 14 closed-chest pigs. Significant depression in RV ejection fraction and stroke volume index after 10 minutes and was observed (P less than 0.05). CK, LDH, and TROP were positive in control tissue with a diminution of CK and LDH staining along the subendocardium after 15 minutes of ischemia. Irreversible ultrastructural injury in conjunction with large losses of CK and LDH became evident after 30 minutes. Thus, in the pig, which has a coronary anatomy similar to humans, significant RV dysfunction and irreversible myocardial injury can be demonstrated after 15 to 30 minutes of ischemia.\r"

Each subject was given an intravenous bolus of dTc followed by an infusion to allow three different levels of inspiratory muscle weakness as measured by maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Levels of MIP were control (-90 cm H2O), -60, -40, and -20 cm H2O. Vital capacity (VC), hand grip strength (HGS), and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) were obtained at each level. At each level of weakness and at intermediate values during recovery, muscles of airway protection were functionally assessed by noting the MIP at which the maneuver could be accomplished and the MIP at which they could not. The mean of these two values was calculated for each subject. The tests were: 1) ability to swallow, 2) ability to perform a valsalva maneuver, 3) prevent obstruction of the airway, and 4) ability to approximate teeth. These were compared with head lift and straight leg raising. At maximum neuromuscular blockade (MIP of -20 cm H2O), VC was 2.0 liters, HGs was 0, and PETCO2 was normal. Muscles of airway protection were still incapacitated. Swallowing returned above MIP of -43 cm H2O, approximation of teeth above -42 cm H2O, airway obstruction above -39 cm H2O, and valsalva above -33 cm H2O. Thus, although ventilation may be adequate at MIP = -25 mmHg, the muscles of airway protection are still nonfunctional.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An axillary blockade was performed on 10 healthy patients scheduled for forearm or hand surgery using a new catheter technique. Mepivacaine 1% with epinephrine (7 mg/kg) was administered initially and followed 30 min later by half the original dose (3.5 mg/kg). Plasma levels of mepivacaine were estimated at frequent intervals for 5 h after the initial injection. There were no symptoms or signs of local anesthetic toxicity, and plasma levels of mepivacaine remained below those that usually caused symptoms. In conclusion, the authors conclude that mepivacaine 1% with epinephrine (10.5 mg/kg) can be safely administered in divided doses into the axillary sheath within a 31-min period.\r"

Postoperative muscle pain, in 11 body parts, was assessed by a linear analogue scale questionnaire that was completed by each patient on the evening of surgery and for the next three mornings. All patients had general endotracheal anesthesia with nitrous oxide, thiopental, and fentanyl. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg (3-4 min after 3 mg of d-tubocurarine) was given to 14 patients for tracheal intubation and then by infusion for additional muscle relaxation. Another 14 patients received vecuronium 50 micrograms/kg iv as the only muscle relaxant used; all of these patients had residual neuromuscular blockade antagonized with glycopyrrolate 7 micrograms/kg and edrophonium 0.5 mg/kg iv. Both groups were similar in age, weight, length of procedure, time to discharge, and amount of thiopental and fentanyl used (P greater than 0.05). No difference was noted in either group with respect to the severity of pain by body part over time. Mean total body pain scores were generated for each group at all four intervals as an alternate type of analysis. No statistical significance was demonstrated by a Student's t test in any group at any interval sampled. The authors failed to demonstrate that the substitution of vecuronium for succinylcholine lowers the incidence of myalgia when used in outpatient diagnostic laparoscopy. They refrain from concluding that vecuronium contributes to postanesthetic myalgia, but feel justified in stating that the avoidance of succinylcholine did not lower the severity or occurrence of muscle pains after laparoscopy when vecuronium was used in its place.\r"

Thirty-two children between the ages of 2-12 yr for whom early postoperative tracheal extubation was anticipated were randomly assigned to control and study groups. Study subjects received a caudal injection of preservative free morphine sulfate (0.075 mg/kg) in preservative-free normal saline (5-10 ml) following completion of surgery, but prior to awakening and extubation of the trachea. Supplemental intravenous morphine administration and pain scores were recorded for 24 h. Patients in the study group received significantly less (P less than 0.03) morphine (0.32 mg.kg-1.24 h-1) and had significantly lower pain scores than did patients in the control group (0.71 mg.kg-1.24 h-1). The mean duration of complete analgesia in patients receiving caudally administered morphine was 6 h (range 2-12), but decreased analgesic requirements were noted for the entire 24 h. No respiratory depression was evident by clinical variables or repeated arterial blood gas values. Nausea without vomiting occurred in 4/16 patients in the study group. No patient described pruritis. The authors were unable to evaluate the occurrence of urinary retention because all patients had indwelling urinary catheters. They found caudal epidural morphine to be safe and effective in the treatment of postoperative pain in children following open heart surgery.\r"

Serum sufentanil concentrations were determined in samples drawn at increasing intervals over a 24-h period. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fit to the concentration versus time data. Total drug clearance was 15.0 +/- 3.2 ml.min-1.kg-1. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss) was 8.7 +/- 4.5 l.kg-1. The elimination half-time were positively correlated with patient age. There were no significant correlations between the pharmacokinetic variables and the duration of aortic cross-clamping, the duration of surgery, or the rate or total volume of iv fluids given intraoperatively. In general surgical patients, the mean elimination half-time of sufentanil has been reported to be 2.7 h. When sufentanil is used in large doses as the primary anesthetic agent for patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, the long elimination half-time observed implies that recovery will take much longer than would have been anticipated from previously published pharmacokinetic data.\r"

Seventeen dogs divided into two groups were studied 3-4 weeks after implantation of ameroid coronary artery constrictors to completely occlude the proximal part of the left anterior descending artery. Experiments were performed during anesthesia with an opiate that was infused intravenously throughout the experiments. In Group 1 (n = 9), measurements were obtained during control and during isoflurane- (1.6-2.2 vol%) induced hypotension (mean arterial pressure, 60 mmHg). In Group 2 (n = 8), the identical protocol was applied, but norepinephrine was infused to maintain normotension. Dipyridamole effects were studied in five animals of Group 2 after a second control period at least 1 h after discontinuation of isoflurane. Isoflurane-induced hypotension caused reductions of blood flow and surface tissue oxygen pressures in the collateral flow-dependent area. Vasodilation in the normal left ventricular areas was demonstrated by an unchanged blood flow despite a reduced oxygen consumption and by a significantly increased coronary sinus hemoglobin oxygen saturation. When arterial pressure was maintained at its control level by norepinephrine, tissue oxygen pressures remained constant and collateral as well as normal area flow increased significantly during isoflurane. Coronary vascular resistance was lower during administration of isoflurane and norepinephrine compared with that during isoflurane induced hypotension, suggesting a significant contribution of tissue oxygen demand in regulation of coronary vascular resistance. At comparable levels of arterial pressure and left ventricular oxygen consumption, normal zone blood flow was significantly higher during dipyridamole than during isoflurane and norepinephrine. Thus, isoflurane-induced hypotension decreased blood flow and tissue oxygen pressures of collateral flow-dependent myocardial areas. However, neither isoflurane nor dipyridamole caused such alterations when arterial pressure was normal.\r"

However, pulmonary resistance (RL) is the sum of airway resistance (Raw), which changes with airway caliber, and of tissue resistance (Rti), which depends on the pressure-volume hysteresis of the lung. To separate the effects of halothane on airway caliber from its possible effects on tissue pressure-volume hysteresis in the unstimulated lung and during bronchoconstriction, the authors measured both components of RL before and during vagus nerve stimulation in 12 dogs before and during halothane administration. Rti was always the major component of RL, constituting 77 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) of RL before vagus nerve stimulation and 64 +/- 21% of RL during stimulation in the absence of halothane. Vagus nerve stimulation caused approximately equal increases in both Rti and Raw. Halothane attenuated the response of both Rti and Raw to vagus nerve stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. At 1 MAC, the Rti response was 44 +/- 13% of its value before halothane administration and the Raw response was 32 +/- 12% of its value before halothane administration; these responses were not significantly different. The authors conclude that changes in RL during halothane administration are caused not only by changes in airway caliber, as previously assumed, but also reflect a significant effect of halothane on lung tissue pressure-volume hysteresis.\r"

After a control period, drugs were administered at 20-min intervals by intravenous bolus injection. Group 1 animals (n = 5) received fentanyl, pentobarbital, and naloxone (0.01 mg.kg-1), whereas Group 2 animals (n = 6) had the order of fentanyl and pentobarbital reversed. All animals responded to pain (withdrawal to tail clamping) and appeared conscious (eyes open, alert to sound) when either fentanyl or barbiturate was given alone. The combination of drugs, however, produced complete unresponsiveness. All of these effects were reversed by naloxone. Cardiac output did not change after either fentanyl or pentobarbital was administered individually but decreased significantly (29% in Group 1, 21% in Group 2) after administration of the combination of both. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were unchanged. Cerebral blood flow, oxygen (O2) transport, and O2 consumption did not change after either administration of fentanyl or pentobarbital alone but decreased significantly after both (22%, 30%, 19%, respectively, in Group 1 and 35%, 40%, 38%, respectively, in Group 2). The decrease in cerebral O2 transport nearly paralleled the decrease in cerebral O2 consumption such that the ratio, the fractional O2 extraction, increased slightly. Fentanyl decreased kidney blood flow alone (24%) and in combination with pentobarbital (25%), although pentobarbital did so only when combined with fentanyl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The method involved scanning the heart to obtain serial images covering the entire left ventricular cavity at end-expiration. An off-line computer analysis of the images was used to form three-dimensional reconstructions of the left ventricular cavity at end-diastole and end-systole, from which stroke volume was determined. Comparison with stroke volume determined by thermodilution during a wide range of hemodynamic conditions gave the following results for least-squares regression on 57 determinations (with the 95% confidence limits in parentheses): slope 0.95 (0.842-1.06), ordinate intercept 2.1 (2.0-2.2) ml, standard error of the estimate 4.1 ml, and correlation coefficient of 0.92 (0.87-0.95). Histologic examination of sections of esophagus surrounding the tip of the probe in nine dogs demonstrated minimal trauma to the esophageal wall, with eight specimens described as normal and one showing mild inflammation. The authors conclude that three-dimensional reconstruction of the left ventricular cavity from multiple transesophageal images offers a safe and accurate, although presently tedious, method for determining stroke volume.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of mechanical factors to the vascular resistance of the atelectatic lung has been studied in vivo in the anesthetized open-chest dog. When the left lung was ventilated with an hypoxic gas mixture (while the right lung was ventilated with 100% O2), left lung blood flow decreased from 0.99 +/- 0.11 1.min-1 to 0.40 +/- 0.08 1.min-1 due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (hypoxic stimulus PSO2 = 36.1 +/- 0.8 mmHg). When the left lung was made atelectatic, blood flow decreased to 0.65 +/- 0.11 1.min-1, consistent with a weaker hypoxic stimulus (PSO2 = 54.0 +/- 3.2 mmHg). With the addition of sodium nitroprusside infused intravenously, left lung blood flow increased to 1.05 +/- 0.14 1.min-1 during atelectasis, and to 0.61 +/- 0.09 1.min-1 during hypoxic ventilation, while flow remained at 0.94 +/- 0.18 1.min-1 during hyperoxic ventilation. When the results were plotted on pressure-flow diagrams, the hyperoxic, hypoxic, and atelectatic lung points fell on the same pressure-flow line in the presence of nitroprusside. It is concluded that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is the major (but not necessarily only) determinant of increased vascular resistance in the atelectatic lung, and that passive mechanical factors do not measurably affect blood flow distribution during open-chest atelectasis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 and 100 micrograms/kg) on the discharge activity of the medullary inspiratory neurons and of the phrenic nerve were studied following vagotomy in nine decerebrate, paralyzed mechanically ventilated cats. In six cats, the inspiratory neurons explored were in the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) associated with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), while in the remaining three, they were in the ventral respiratory group (VRG). In the former group, the rhythmic discharge of the inspiratory neurons was disrupted by fentanyl and replaced by a continuous discharge superimposed with irregularly occurring bursts. These changes were also reflected by the phrenic nerve discharge. Inspiratory neuronal activity increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at 1 and 5 min after completion of fentanyl injection. Disruption of the rhythmic activity of the inspiratory neurons and its replacement by a continuous and irregular discharge may lead to sustained contraction of inspiratory muscles and cessation of respiration. In the VRG, the activity of the inspiratory neurons was totally abolished by fentanyl. Thus, it appears that different groups of medullary inspiratory neurons have differential sensitivity to fentanyl. Nalbuphine, an opiate agonist-antagonist, restored the normal pattern and magnitude of the activity of the inspiratory neurons.\r"

Ca2+ was replaced by Ba2+ in order to constantly activate myofibrils. The dynamic stiffness of the contractured muscle was examined by exposing the muscle to sinusoidal length perturbations at frequencies of 0.05-30 Hz under two concentrations of anesthetic, approximately 0.5, and 1.5-2 mM, and at two Ba2+ concentrations, 0.5 and 1.5-2 mM. The anesthetics had no effect on the frequency (fmin) at which minimum stiffness occurred, but markedly decreased the stiffness modulus at high frequencies (Khi). The decrease in Khi was significant for all anesthetics at the P less than 0.05 level. Increasing the Ba2+ concentration from 0.5 to 1.5-2 mM in the presence of 0.5 mM of anesthetic resulted in a return of Khi to control levels. The authors conclude that halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane did not alter actin-myosin ATPase kinetics, because fmin was unchanged, but decreased the number of crossbridge interactions, because Khi was significantly decreased by all three anesthetics.\r"

  ".U": "89164871\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of halothane on hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli was investigated in anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. It was found that increasing the end-tidal halothane concentration from sub-MAC to supra-MAC levels was frequently associated with a reversal of the mean arterial pressure response to a noxious stimulus from a pressor response to depressor response. The depressor responses could be produced by noxious stimuli at several sites but were of greatest frequency (100%) and magnitude (up to -80 mmHg) after clamp application at the base of the tail. The depressor responses were often, but not always, accompanied by decreases in heart rate. The correlation coefficient between the changes in heart rate and the changes in mean arterial pressure caused by noxious stimuli was +0.61 (n = 9). The authors further characterized the depressor responses in an additional 18 rats. The depressor responses were not influenced by vagotomy or muscarinic cholinergic blockade and were associated with concurrent decreases in both cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. The hemodynamic changes associated with the depressor responses were consistent with a centrally mediated withdrawal of sympathetic tone. Knowledge of this effect of halothane on the arterial blood pressure and heart rate responses to noxious stimuli may be important for correctly interpreting animal responses to noxious stimuli in the presence of general anesthetic agents, particularly because animals are frequently used to characterize both the potency and the hemodynamic effects of anesthetic agents. The presence of depressor responses also indicates that mean arterial pressure responses to noxious stimuli cannot be used as a linear index of anesthetic depth in rats anesthetized with halothane.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure and the longitudinal distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance (arterial and venous components) can be determined by analysis of pressure decay curves following pulmonary artery occlusion. To validate this technique in intact animals, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure decay curves were obtained from both lungs in six anesthetized sheep during control conditions (100% O2) and during unilateral hypoxic ventilation (100% O2 versus 100% N2). Analysis of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure curves indicated the following: 1) in the hypoxic lung, unilateral hypoxia increased the precapillary portion of pulmonary vascular resistance from 72% of the total resistance to 89% of the total resistance in that lung; 2) in the nonhypoxic lung, unilateral hypoxia did not significantly affect the distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance; and 3) unilateral hypoxia produced no significant change in pulmonary capillary pressure in the hypoxic lung compared with control; however, pulmonary capillary pressure was significantly greater in the nonhypoxic lung. These results are consistent with other evidence that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction acts locally and primarily affects resistance at the arteriolar level. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure decay curve analysis appears to be a valid technique for the measurement of pulmonary capillary pressure and the longitudinal distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance in intact anesthetized animals. These measurements pertain only to the vasculature distal to the site of pulmonary artery occlusion with the catheter, and, thus, caution must be used when applying this technique in a setting of nonhomogenous lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of two new steroidal nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, structurally related to vecuronium, have been compared with those of succinylcholine in anesthetized cats and pigs. Both new compounds (Org 7617 and Org 9616) exhibited properties typical of nondepolarizing relaxants in each species. Org 9616 was one-fifth (ED50 cat tibialis 154 micrograms.kg-1) and Org 7617 was one-tenth (ED50 cat tibialis 287 micrograms.kg-1) as potent as vecuronium as a neuromuscular blocking drug. Both compounds produced rapidly developing muscle relaxation in cats that, like that of succinylcholine, was transient in time course (onset/duration of action--tibialis anterior muscle: Org 7617 1.6/3.9 min; Org 9616 1.5/4.3 min; succinylcholine 1.7/5.7 min). In pigs that were used as a predictor of duration of action in humans, both Org 7617 and Org 9616 also produced short-lived neuromuscular blockade. The neuromuscular blocks produced by Org 7617 and Org 9616 were readily reversed by neostigmine. Both compounds blocked the heart rate responses to vagal stimulation at doses higher than those required to produce neuromuscular block. The vagal:neuromuscular blocking ratio for Org 7617 was 10, and for Org 9616 was 17. These compare to approximate published values for vecuronium, atracurium, and pancuronium of 60, 25, and 3, respectively. Ganglion block was only seen at 30-60 times the neuromuscular blocking doses. Both compounds produced a decrease in arterial blood pressure. This was more pronounced with Org 7617. In addition, Org 9616 produced a slight increase in heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such an occurrence could increase the risk of transfer of such patients. To provide a more definitive answer to this question, we reviewed hospital and transfer records for all patients with acute myocardial infarction transferred by our critical care transfer service between January 1, 1985, and November 30, 1987, noting the occurrence of five types of arrhythmia: ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, bradycardia, and atrioventricular block, both before and during transfer. Five hundred patients with acute myocardial infarction less than 48 hours old were transferred during this period. Two hundred twenty-five patients received thrombolytic therapy; 270 did not (five unknown). The type of acute myocardial infarction was known for 471 patients: 192 were anterior, 203 were inferior, and 76 were lateral. There were no deaths during transfer. Overall survival through hospitalization was 91%. The incidence of arrhythmia was 36% before transport and 12% during transport. There was no difference in arrhythmias overall, or with respect to any of the five arrhythmias specified, between patients who received thrombolytic therapy before and during transport and those who did not. Reperfusion arrhythmia does not appear to be a clinically significant entity during the transport of patients who are receiving IV thrombolytic therapy.\r"

The overall success rate for IV line placement was 91%, and the average successful IV line starting time was 2.5 minutes. En route IV line attempts had similar success rates and starting times. The on-scene IV line starting times were shorter than the transport times in 86% of patients. We conclude that definitive IV line medical therapy, when available, can be delivered effectively by paramedics at the scene. We also conclude that en route IV line placement is feasible in trauma victims.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a retrospective study of the interventions performed by physicians in 191 transfers by our pediatric critical care transport team. Currently, the team always includes a pediatrician or pediatric resident, a pediatric emergency department nurse, and a pediatric respiratory therapist. Procedures performed during transport were divided into those done only by physicians in our institution and those also performed by nurses or respiratory therapists. Physician procedures were performed in 9% of transports. Medications given during transport were divided into three categories. Category 1 included drugs used only in our ICU and therefore with a physician present. Category 2 drugs were usually given in the ICU but were occasionally administered on the floor with close physician involvement. Category 3 included drugs routinely given on the floor with rare physician involvement. Category 1 drugs were required on 19% of transports, category 2 was the highest level used on 15%, and category 3 drugs alone were used on 20%. No medications were administered on 46% of transports. At the completion of each trip, the transport physician was asked if he believed the transport would have been successful without a physician but with an experienced pediatric ED nurse and respiratory therapist. The answer was \"yes\" in 46% of the cases (n = 166), \"no\" in 43%, and \"unsure\" in 11%. In 91% of the transports, no procedures were performed that required a physician. In 66%, no medications were used that required physician presence. In at least 46%, the physician believed his expertise was not required for the transport's success.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Records of 31 episodes of sustained, wide QRS complex tachycardia treated with IV boluses of lidocaine in 20 consecutive patients were reviewed. Most of the episodes were managed in the emergency department. Patient ages ranged from 18 to 91 years (mean +/- SD, 64 +/- 17), and 17 of 20 were men. All but three had coronary artery disease. Although 19 of 20 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of \"rule out acute myocardial infarction,\" only two had this diagnosis confirmed. Seventeen patients had ventricular tachycardia, and three had wide QRS complex supraventricular tachycardia. Patients were given one to three boluses of lidocaine totaling 75 to 400 mg (127 +/- 64 mg). Termination of the tachycardia was temporally related to lidocaine administration in only six of 31 episodes (19%) occurring in five of 20 patients. In three of these five patients, lidocaine was given again for a recurrence of the tachycardia and was ineffective. A similarly low efficacy was seen in 20 episodes initially managed in the hospital compared with 11 episodes initially managed by paramedics. Thus, although lidocaine is widely considered the drug therapy of first choice for sustained wide QRS complex tachycardia, it was not usually effective in our study. Patients presenting to the ED with this rhythm disturbance rarely prove to have acute myocardial infarction. Although this small retrospective study should not be the basis for a change in standard medical practice, the recommendation of lidocaine as initial therapy for such patients should be reexamined.\r"

Serum electrolytes are commonly ordered in the evaluation of patients with gastroenteritis. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all 281 patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis seen in our emergency department during a recent six-month period. Electrolytes were ordered on 207 of these patients, and the time spent in the ED was three to four times longer for patients on whom electrolytes were ordered. Of these 207, 24 (11%) had electrolyte abnormalities, but only two (1%) had clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities, which were defined as values that affected patient treatment or disposition. On presentation, 56 patients (27%) had orthostatic vital sign changes (defined as a pulse increase of 30 or more on standing). Five (10%) had electrolyte abnormalities. None of the abnormalities were clinically significant. Eleven patients (5%) were hospitalized. One patient had electrolyte abnormalities that were not the cause of hospitalization. No patients with uncomplicated gastroenteritis alone had clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities. We conclude that there is no justification for the routine ordering of serum electrolytes on the adult patient with acute gastroenteritis.\r"

We evaluated the efficacy of OLMC use under this broad patient inclusion rule and limited paramedic discretion. OLMC was associated with an average of an eight-minute longer on-scene time, and an infrequent rate of physician-directed deviation from written treatment protocols (3.7% of all OLMC calls). Of the system's advanced life support patients, 6.1% experienced changes in their prehospital health status, reflected in changes in the patient's level of consciousness. OLMC use was associated with improved health status in 5.5% of patients compared with 3.2% for those treated without OLMC (P = .1). The health status of 1.3% of the patients treated with OLMC deteriorated. This was not significantly different from the 1.1% of patients treated without OLMC whose status deteriorated. We suggest that targeted OLMC use with expanded paramedic discretion may improve the efficacy of OLMC. Further controlled comparative studies of OLMC efficacy under targeted OLMC use versus broad patient inclusion rules are needed.\r"

A preliminary study was undertaken to determine whether so-called gatekeeping of access to EDs was common practice. Medical directors of HMOs in 39 states and the District of Columbia were surveyed by a mail questionnaire to assess policies regarding ED access. There were 98 (80.3%) respondents to 122 questionnaires, representing 26% of all federally qualified HMOs in the United States. Of the 98 respondents, 90 (92%) used the distinctions \"life-threatening\" and \"nonlife-threatening\" in defining their ED access policies. In life-threatening situations, members were permitted to go to any hospital without calling the gatekeeper first. In nonlife-threatening situations 78 of 98 (80%) required that permission be obtained prior to an ED visit. Most required a telephone call; nonphysicians could act as gatekeepers in 46 of 78 (59%). Thirty-nine percent of the 98 respondents limited their members to using the EDs of certain hospitals only. Ninety-four of 98 (96%) reviewed all ED visits prior to making any payment. We discuss here the implications of these gatekeeping policies.\r"

Nine percent of the calls were answered and managed only by ED unit secretaries. Fifty-six percent of the respondents failed to ask the caller any questions about the patient or the chief complaint. Only four ED respondents instructed the caller to call 911 and have the patient brought to the ED. The data suggest that telephone advice given by some EDs is nonstandardized and may be inadequate to the point of jeopardizing the welfare of the caller.\r"

Analyses of state and local injury statistics are necessary to identify local prevention needs in order to set program priorities. We discuss an example, an analysis of statewide injury fatalities identified through the Illinois Vital Records database. The overall death rate for injuries in illinois was lower than that found for the United States. However, the need for research on several high-risk age groups for certain injuries was identified. Most notably, the homicide rate for those 15 to 24 years old was 140% of the national rate. Other specific nonwhite age groups were overrepresented in poisoning, fire, and firearm deaths, while specific white age groups were overrepresented in suicide, fall, and drowning deaths. The research regarding the etiologies of these injuries and the formulation and evaluation of prevention strategies based on this research must be interdisciplinary. The emergency physician is in a unique position to serve as a member of such an interdisciplinary injury control team, but currently there is little emphasis on or training for this role.\r"

Reported rates of chronic cough, bronchitis, and chest illness during the 1980-1981 school year were positively associated with all measures of particulate pollution (TSP, PM15, PM2.5, and FSO4) and positively but less strongly associated with concentrations of two of the gases (SO2 and NO2). Frequency of earache also tended to be associated with particulate concentrations, but no associations were found with asthma, persistent wheeze, hay fever, or nonrespiratory illness. No associations were found between pollutant concentrations and any of the pulmonary function measures considered (FVC, FEV1, FEV0.75, and MMEF). Children with a history of wheeze or asthma had a much higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and there was some evidence that the association between air pollutant concentrations and symptom rates was stronger among children with these markers for hyperreactive airways. These data provide further evidence that rates of respiratory illnesses and symptoms are elevated among children living in cities with high particulate pollution. They also suggest that children with hyperreactive airways may be particularly susceptible to other respiratory symptoms when exposed to these pollutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if there was an excess of adverse health outcomes in the population exposed (defined by place of residence), a health survey was undertaken in 1985 in this area and in one unexposed to emissions but demographically similar. Participation was 92% from both the exposed population (n = 2,157) and a representative sample (n = 839) of the main reference population. More respiratory symptoms were reported in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group among those 5 to 13 yrs of age (28% versus 18%) and among never-smokers greater than or equal to 14 yrs of age (35% versus 24%). FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC were similar in both areas. Dichotomizing the level of exposure (high, low) within the exposed area revealed a trend in the high exposure area toward increased respiratory symptoms in the younger age group (39% versus 24%), but decreased symptoms in the older age group (33% versus 36% among never-smokers). FEV1 was similar between the two areas. The excess of respiratory symptoms in the exposed area unassociated with impaired spirometric values would be compatible with increased awareness of health or a small biologic environmental effect.\r"

Although asbestos fibers can stimulate alveolar macrophages (AM) to release PA in vitro, the effect of chronic asbestos exposure of the lower respiratory tract on lung PA activity remains unknown. The present study was designed to evaluate PA activity of alveolar macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in asbestos-exposed sheep and asbestos workers. Forty-three sheep were exposed to either 100 mg UICC chrysotile B asbestos in 100 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or to 100 ml PBS by tracheal infusion every 2 wk for 18 months. At Month 18, chest roentgenograms were analyzed and alveolar macrophage and extracellular fluid PA activity were measured in samples obtained by BAL. Alveolar macrophage PA activity was increased in the asbestos-exposed sheep compared to control sheep (87.2 +/- 17.3 versus 41.1 +/- 7.2 U/10(5) AM-24 h, p less than 0.05) as was the BAL fluid PA activity (674.9 +/- 168.4 versus 81.3 +/- 19.7 U/mg alb-24 h, p less than 0.01). Among the asbestos-exposed sheep, 10 had normal chest roentgenograms (Group SA) and 15 had irregular interstitial opacities (Group SB). Strikingly, whereas Group SA did not differ from the control group in BAL cellularity or PA activity, Group SB had marked increases in alveolar macrophages (p less than 0.005), AM PA activity (p less than 0.02), and BAL PA activity (p less than 0.001) compared to the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the type and degree of upper airway obstruction (UAO) in a group of patients with Parkinson's disease in different stages of the disease, we obtained maximal expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume (MEFV and MIFV) curves and maximal static mouth pressures. The clinical disability was indicated by a Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) scale, ranging from III to V, and a more continuous Northwestern University Disability Scale (NUDS), ranging from zero to 50. Twelve patients were in H-Y Group III, and eleven and eight were in Groups IV and V, respectively. The pattern of the flow-volume curves was classified as either normal, or with superimposed regular or irregular oscillations (A), or with rounded-off and delayed expiratory peak appearance (B). Mean MEFV curves in Groups III and IV were not appreciably different from reference. In Group V, the mean curve showed a lower peak expiratory flow (PEF) and a more convex tail. Only the effort-dependent variables PEF, peak inspiratory flow (PIF), and maximal mouth pressures at RV and TLC (PmTLC and PmRV) appeared to be significantly correlated with the NUDS index and decreased with increasing clinical disability. The mean values of those variables were also significantly different between the H-Y groups. The number of normal curves decreased from H-Y Group III to Group V. The contribution of A and B curves was relatively equal in the groups, with only a small number of A curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies were performed serially from 1 to 12 months after injury. Results were compared with those of control groups of chronic (greater than 1 yr after injury) quadriplegics and normal volunteers. We found that lung compliance was lower in acute and chronic quadriplegics (0.129 +/- 0.023 and 0.176 +/- 0.043 L/mm Hg, respectively) than in normal subjects (0.278 +/- 0.086 L/mm Hg) and that these changes apparently occurred within 1 month of injury. Specific lung compliance appeared to be reduced to a lesser degree, suggesting that the changes in lung compliance were partly due to reduced lung volumes and partly to altered mechanical properties of the lung. During respiratory maneuvers, abdomen and rib cage dimensional changes demonstrated rib cage distortion. This distortion was less severe in chronic than in acute quadriplegics. The improvement in chest wall stability was likely due to increased strength of cervical accessory muscles of respiration and improved coupling of the various rib cage elements in chronic quadriplegics.\r"

  ".W": "Although patients using transtracheal oxygen (TTO2) frequently report decreased dyspnea and improved exercise tolerance, the mechanism for these effects is unknown. We hypothesized that these patients might have decreased inspired minute ventilation (VI), and this might be one mechanism for their decreased dyspnea and improved exercise tolerance. The effects of TTO2 on VI were studied in seven patients with chronic hypoxemia; two had chronic obstructive lung disease and five had severe restrictive disorders. VI, exhaled minute ventilation (VE), respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), earlobe O2 saturation (O2 sat), and arterial blood gases were measured while patients received varying amounts of oxygen either transtracheally or by mouth to achieve equivalent degrees of oxygenation. With TTO2 VI was reduced compared to VI with mouth O2 at similar levels of PaO2. As TTO2 flow rate increased, VI decreased; at 6 L/min O2 delivered transtracheally, mean VI was reduced by 54 +/- 7.0%. Reduction in VI was due to decreased VT; RR did not change. To determine if air delivered transtracheally decreased VI, five patients were studied while receiving air transtracheally or by mouth. With transtracheal air, VI was significantly less than VI obtained while breathing air by mouth. We conclude that VI is decreased when oxygen or air is delivered directly into the trachea and that VI decreases as transtracheal flow increases. This effect is not due solely to changes in oxygenation. Decreased dyspnea and improved exercise tolerance in patients using TTO2 may be due to decreased VI and decreased inspiratory work of breathing.\r"

  ".W": "To determine and to quantify the pulmonary and extrapulmonary contributors to hypoxemia in liver cirrhosis, we measured in 10 cirrhotics blood gases, P50, hemodynamics, ventilation, and the distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios (VA/Q) using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. Seven patients had an arterial hypoxemia (PaO2 = 69 +/- 6 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), and three patients were normoxemic (PaO2 = 89 +/- 6 mm Hg). In each hypoxemic patient, the VA/Q distributions were characterized by the presence of low VA/Q units. A negative logarithmic correlation was found between the dispersion of the blood flow distribution and the arterial PO2. An acute inspiratory hypoxia (FIO2, 0.125) elicited an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance by 58.5% in the hypoxemic group and by 81.6% in the normoxemic one (p = NS between the two groups). The percent change in pulmonary vascular resistance induced by hypoxia was not correlated with the percent change in the dispersion of the blood flow distribution. A theoretical analysis showed that the mean arterial PO2 of 69 mm Hg of the hypoxemic group differed from a normal reference value of 96 mm Hg as a result of the combined effects of reduced hemoglobin (-4 mm Hg), increased P50 (+4 mm Hg), increased ventilation (+10 mm Hg), low VA/Q (-35 mm Hg), and true shunt (-2 mm Hg). These results show that the \"hypoxemia of liver cirrhosis\" is essentially caused by VA/Q mismatching, which is not explained by an abnormal hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\r"

We investigated the relationship between nasopharyngeal pressure (Pnp) or pressure within the mouth (Pmo) and Pes during a maximal sniff from FRC without a noseclip. We measured Pes, Pnp, and Pmo simultaneously in 10 normal volunteers, and in 12 patients with inspiratory muscle weakness. In both groups, Pnp and Pmo were slightly less but very close to Pes. In normal volunteers, the mean ratio Pnp/Pes was 0.92 +/- 0.006 (mean +/- SE) and Pmo/Pes was 0.95 +/- 0.006. Regression analysis showed Pes = 4.57 + 1.05 Pnp (r = 0.995, p less than 0.001) and Pes = 0.74 + 1.05 Pmo (r = 0.994, p less than 0.001). Similar relationships between Pnp, Pmo, and Pes were found over a wide range of pressures generated by submaximal sniffs in normal subjects. In patients, the mean ratio Pnp/Pes was 0.90 +/- 0.02 and Pmo/Pes was 0.87 +/- 0.03. Regression analysis showed Pes = 5.12 + 1.0 Pnp (r = 0.949, p less than 0.001) and Pes = 11.2 + 0.882 Pmo (r = 0.936, p less than 0.001). We conclude that Pnp and Pmo predict Pes during a maximal sniff in both normal subjects and in patients with inspiratory muscle weakness. Sniff Pnp and/or Pmo may provide a useful and less invasive method of measuring maximal inspiratory pressures during a sniff.\r"

Twitch stimulation was applied through fine wire electrodes implanted near both phrenic nerves. Stimulations were tolerated with little discomfort and constant phrenic nerve responses were maintained for hours. At FRC the group mean Pdit was 31.4 cm H2O (range, 19 to 36 cm H2O), and its coefficient of variation ranged between 2 and 5% in individual subjects. At 1 L above FRC, the Pdit decreased a mean of 7.8 cm H2O (range, 2.8 to 11.9 cm H2O). This change was caused primarily by a decrease in esophageal pressure amplitude. The shape of the relaxed chest wall was altered by loading the rib cage with a force of 5 to 9 kg. Load and shape had little effect on Pdit independently of lung volume. Our modified technique of phrenic nerve stimulation through small wire electrodes is ideally suited for longitudinal intervention studies in patients. We conclude that the variability of Pdit with shape is small compared with its expected decrease with lung volume.\r"

We wanted to see if these increases persisted during deep non-REM sleep. Using noninvasive techniques, we have quantified the pattern of breathing, arterial oxygen saturation, and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) during standardized conditions of relaxed wakefulness and during Stage 4 (S4) sleep in eight patients with ILD and eight age-matched normal control subjects. The patients were given supplemental oxygen in order to prevent hypoxic ventilatory stimulation. The data were compared between the two groups during each of these states and also between states within each group. During wakefulness in the patients, respiratory frequency (f) and PtcCO2 were higher (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively) and inspiratory time (TI) and expiratory time (TE) were shorter (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001, respectively) than in the normal subjects. However, during S4 sleep, there were no significant differences between groups. Comparing wakefulness with S4 sleep: in the normal subjects during sleep, f and PtcCO2 were increased (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), TE was shortened (p less than 0.01), and ventilation (VI) was unchanged. In contrast, in the patients, f decreased (p less than 0.001), TE lengthened (p less than 0.01), VI decreased (p less than 0.05), and the rise in PtcCO2 seen in the normal subjects during sleep did not occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A 5-year retrospective analysis of SP admissions was carried out to determine if delta AP do play a role in SP development. Using a 36-yr record of hourly delta AP, a normative background for delta AP was constructed. A fall in AP below the fifth, or a rise above the ninety-fifth percentile during these time periods, was classed as \"unusual.\" Atmospheric pressure changes in the 4 days prior to SP were analyzed. The expected frequency of SP occurring by chance, if no relationship to delta AP existed, was also calculated. A total of 192 cases of SP was analyzed. Traumatic pneumothoraces were excluded. The majority of cases (72%) had been exposed to at least one \"unusual\" delta AP in the 4 days prior to onset of symptoms. Among those with four or more \"unusual\" exposures, SP occurrence was significantly more frequent than expected by chance alone (p less than 10(-10]. A strong positive association between delta AP and SP was not found in all cases, as delta AP are unlikely to be the only causative factor for SP. This finding of a relationship with ambient pressure changes lends support to the theory that SP develop as a result of rupture of subpleural blebs.\r"

The extension of the neoplasms detected by thoracoscopy as well as the results of our attempts to carry out pleurodesis by talc were also studied. Pleural glucose levels were less than 60 mg/dl in 16 cases, and the cytologic yield was positive in 14 of these cases (87%). The glucose value rose above this level in 61 cases, and the cytology was positive in 30 cases (49%; p less than 0.006). A pH less than 7.30 was encountered in 18 cases and there were positive cytologic findings in 14 of these cases (78%). The pH was above 7.30 in 46 cases, and cytologic studies were positive in 22 cases (48%; p less than 0.03).

The extension of the lesions observed during thoracoscopy showed important differences as far as this related to the glucose levels (p less than 0.005), but this relationship as it concerned pH levels was even more significant (p less than 0.0002).

To learn more about airway receptors mediating this prolonged apneic response and factors determining its occurrence, we examined the importance of stimulus location and associations between prolonged apnea, bradycardia, and upper airway responses. A total of 29 episodes of prolonged apnea were recorded after water stimulation in 12 infants. Bradycardia (HR less than 100) followed stimulus delivery but was always preceded by apnea and did not appear as an independent chemoreflex response. Behavioral arousal and prolonged apnea were not mutually exclusive responses and recovery from prolonged apnea was not always closely linked with arousal. Occurrence of prolonged apnea was greater after pharyngeal than nasal stimulation, and was frequently associated with coughing, but not with sneezing, suggesting that prolonged apnea is elicited from a sensory site close to, or the same as, one mediating cough. We conclude, using this water stimulus method, that the predominant receptors for chemoreflex-prolonged apnea are located in the pharynx or larynx rather than in the nose.\r"

The median BAL fluid HA concentration was 353 micrograms/L, about six times higher than that seen in control patients (p less than 0.001). The median serum HA value was 619 micrograms/L, which was a 30-fold increase compared with that in the control patients (p less than 0.001). Another connective tissue component, type III procollagen peptide, was not recovered in significant amounts during lavage in patients with ARDS, but it appeared in the bloodstream in increased concentrations (p less than 0.001). Obtained recovery of HA during lavage of patients with ARDS cannot be explained by an enhanced passive leakage from the bloodstream because of increased alveolar-capillary permeability, but rather could reflect a mobilization of HA from lung interstitial tissue because of hydrostatic mechanisms. Alternatively, the appearance of HA in the alveolar space in ARDS might reflect an enhanced lung synthesis of HA. An increased HA production can possibly be mediated, directly or indirectly, by activated complement components, since a significant relationship was seen between increased plasma concentrations of C3a des Arg and BAL fluid HA (r = 0.61; p less than 0.05). The observed accumulation of HA in the small airways in ARDS may be expected to immobilize water and thereby contribute to the interstitial and alveolar edema. The inverse correlation (r = 0.71; p less than 0.01) seen between BAL fluid HA and pulmonary oxygenation index (PaO2/inspired oxygen fraction) supports such a hypothesis.\r"

In 11 asthmatic subjects, we measured specific airway conductance (SGaw) and forced expiratory flow (FEF) before and after the inhalation of naloxone or saline. In another 10 asthmatic subjects, we measured SGaw, FEF, and the ventilatory gas exchange, heart rate, and blood pressure responses produced by a treadmill exercise during 3 separate days: without any pretreatment (Day 1) or preceded by the inhalation of either 10 mg naloxone (Day 2) or saline (Day 3). We found that after 10 mg inhaled naloxone only one of 11 subjects bronchodilated, displaying an isolated, reproducible delta SGaw greater than 40% at 30 and 60 min. In the EIA protocol, the cardiopulmonary responses during exercise remained similar on all experimental days, but in seven of 10 subjects (all with %FEV1/FVC greater than or equal to 70% delta SGaw was -60 +/- 11%, + 1 +/- 40%, and -52 +/- 7% during no treatment, naloxone, and saline days, respectively (p less than 0.05). FEF changes were comparable on all days (p greater than 0.05). In conclusion: (1) consistent with the general role of endogenous opioids, these neurotransmitter/neuromodulators can modulate a stress-related bronchoconstrictor response (EIA), but only very seldom the resting bronchial tone. (2) Naloxone does not blunt EIA through a decrease in the asthmogenic stimulus (i.e., ventilation) or airway caliber change, but presumably through competition with the endogenous opioids released during exercise.\r"

Evidence to identify the mechanisms by which P-3 infection enhances airway hyperreactivity, however, has not been established. The present study evaluated the effect of P-3 infection on histamine release (HR) from isolated peripheral blood guinea pig basophils and lung mast cells. Basophil HR was determined in animals made basophilic with 13 daily intraperitoneal injections of sheep blood. On Day 10 of the sensitization, blood was obtained from all animals, and leukocyte HR was determined to sheep gammaglobulin (SG), which served as the secretagogue. After these baseline studies, the animals were separated into two groups; one was insufflated with P-3 virus and the other with growth medium that did not contain virus. Four days later, animals were killed, basophils and lung mast cells were isolated, HR was determined, and lung tissue was cultured for the presence of virus. In basophils isolated from animals proven to be infected with P-3 virus, we found significantly more histamine released in response to the lower doses of SG and a significant shift in the -log EC50 dose of this antigen causing HR in these cells. Experiments conducted with the calcium ionophore A23187 as the basophil secretagogue in the same experimental design did not demonstrate similar HR findings. Furthermore, a defect in calcium disposition did not account for the enhanced HR from basophils isolated from infected animals. HR from pulmonary mast cells was similar in cells isolated from P-3-infected and control insufflated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Utilizing a cohort of 14,404 subjects, 25 to 74 yr of age, from the First National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANESI, 1971-75) traced by the NHANESI Epidemiologic Followup Survey (1982-84), we investigated prevalence, incidence, predictors, and consequences of adult asthma. Cases were based on subject reports of active doctor-diagnosed asthma (without COPD). Differentiation of asthma from COPD was partially successful, as suggested by correlations with smoking status and pulmonary symptoms, but was imperfect, as suggested by subsequent hospital experience. Followup interview underestimated interim hospital diagnosis of asthma by 28%. Prevalence of active asthma at NHANESI among U.S. adults was estimated at 2.6%, and followup incidence of new-onset asthma at 2.1/1,000/yr. Low income was the strongest independent predictor of asthma; the higher rates seen in blacks were largely explained by their lower income. Males and females had equal prevalence rates, but females had higher incidence rates. Asthma prevalence and incidence were independent of age and cigarette smoking. Asthmatics were often hospitalized with various lung conditions in the followup period, but unlike those with COPD, did not have a significantly increased risk of death.\r"

Immediate and late responses were induced by Ascaris suum antigen inhalation in 11 conscious sheep. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on 3 separate test days, before challenge (control), during the immediate response, and during the late response. Leukotrienes were measured by radioimmunoassay after purification by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. LTB4 and LTC4 were detected in control BALF, but LTD4 was not. LTC4 and LTB4 were increased in the late response (p less than 0.05 compared with each control). The percent neutrophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage was increased during the late response, and this was significantly correlated with pulmonary resistance (p less than 0.01). Histamine levels in BALF were elevated during the immediate response but not during the late response. Our results suggest that histamine and LTC4 may contribute to the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle in the immediate and the late response, respectively. The increase in LTB4, a neutrophil chemotactic factor, during the late response may be responsible for the increase in the percent neutrophils.\r"

Ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality was characterized by a marked bimodal blood flow distribution (perfusion to normal and low VA/Q populations) in all but two patients, with a mean of 27.6 +/- 12.3% of the total perfusion present in the low VA/Q ratio units (between 0.1 and 0.005). As a result, the dispersion of pulmonary blood flow distribution (log SDQ) was severely abnormal (mean, 1.65 +/- 0.28; normal range, 0.3 to 0.6). No patient had a substantial shunt (VA/Q = 0) (mean value, 1.5 +/- 2.3%). The ventilation distribution was never bimodal, but the dispersion of the ventilation distribution (log SDV) was moderately elevated (1.01 +/- 0.24). High VA/Q areas (ventilation to VA/Q units between 10 and 100) were generally absent. While breathing 100% O2, PaO2, PvO2, and PaCO2 significantly rose, as did shunt and blood flow dispersion. Patients with life-threatening acute severe asthma treated by mechanical ventilation show: (1) the most abnormal gas exchange characteristics of the VA/Q spectrum observed to date in human asthma but essentially the same pattern as in patients with less severe disease; (2) a high level of hypoxic pulmonary vascular response; (3) a significant amount of shunt while breathing 100% O2, suggesting the presence of absorption atelectasis or redistribution of blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Human alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were found to bear cytophilic IgA and Fc alpha-receptors (Fc alpha R) on their surface. The cytophilic IgA belongs to the IgA1 subclass, but unoccupied receptors can be saturated with either IgA1 or IgA2 molecules. Although both polymeric and monomeric forms could attach, binding was about 5-fold greater for the polymers. Both cytophilic IgA and Fc alpha R are sensitive to trypsin and disappear after 18 h of AM culture. An increase in cytophilic IgA was observed on AM from untreated patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, but not on AM from steroid-treated patients. A significant correlation was found between IgA levels in BAL and the percentage of AM with cytophilic IgA in normal subjects and in steroid-treated sarcoid patients. However, no such relationship was seen among untreated patients. These data suggest that multiple factors may modulate AM surface receptors for IgA. Inflammatory events occurring in the lungs could alter receptor expression and perhaps be of significance in the immunophysiopathology of certain pulmonary diseases.\r"

The lipid suspensions were labeled with [14C]cholesterol and [3H]phosphatidylcholine. The percent recoveries of the labels were measured over 24 h in alveolar wash, lung tissue after alveolar wash, and the total lungs. All clearance curves for both phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol from liposomes were the same in the presence or absence of MPS. Alveolar clearance curves for both labels from rabbit surfactant were the same; however, the surfactant-associated labels were cleared to the lung tissue more rapidly than were the liposome-derived labels. Despite different alveolar clearance curves, all clearance curves for cholesterol from the total lungs were similar at a rate of 20 to 30%/24 h of the injected labeled cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine was cleared from the total lungs more rapidly, at rates from 35 to 56%/24 h. Although MPS did not change labeled liposomal lipid clearance, the beta-agonist increased surfactant lipid clearance. The different responses to beta-agonist and the different alveolar clearance curves indicated distinct alveolar-to-lung tissue metabolism for liposomal versus surfactant phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, although overall lung clearance rates were similar.\r"

Four days after an intratracheal injection of bleomycin, HA was accumulated in the edematous alveolar septa of the focal areas with lung tissue injury. An interstitial cellular infiltrate of mainly lymphocytes was present. In normal rat lung, HA was not seen in the alveolar tissue but confined to peribronchial and perivascular spaces. Ten and twenty days after bleomycin administration, increasing numbers of macrophages were apparent in the alveolar space. Proliferating fibroblasts and deposition of collagen in the alveolar tissue were observed while the diffuse HA accumulation was becoming less prominent in the alveolar interstitial tissue. HA was more distinctly located in the surroundings of proliferating fibroblasts. A few scattered alveolar macrophages showed a positive staining for HA. An increased water content of the lung was most apparent 4 days after bleomycin administration. The accumulation of HA, a glycosaminoglycan with unique qualities to immobilize water, in the alveolar interstitium suggests a role for HA in the alveolar interstitial edema. The appearance of HA in alveolar macrophages might indicate that macrophage phagocytosis contributes to the elimination of HA from inflamed lung tissue.\r"

Heparin partially prevents the rise in right ventricular pressure and vascular remodeling in chronically hypoxic mice. To determine if this is due to the anticoagulant property of heparin or another property, we compared the effect of oral warfarin given at an anticoagulating dose (0.5 mg/kg/day) to heparin given by continuous infusion at a dose that does not prolong the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (20 units/kg/h) on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling in the guinea pig. Normoxic control animals either untreated or treated with heparin or Coumadin were all alike in blood gases, pulmonary vascular resistance, right heart weights, and pulmonary histology. Hypoxia (10% 0(2) for 10 days) induced similar and significant increases in mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure in both the hypoxic control and warfarin groups (19 +/- 1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) in both groups versus 11 +/- 0.1 mm Hg in the normoxic control group; p less than 0.05). Total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPR) was also increased from 0.041 +/- 0.002 in the normoxic control group to 0.087 +/- 0.007 and 0.071 +/- 0.003 mm Hg/ml/min/kg in the hypoxic control and warfarin groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). Whereas anticoagulation with warfarin did not protect the guinea pig from developing pulmonary hypertension, heparin markedly reduced PA and TPR (15 +/- 1 mm Hg and 0.052 +/- 0.002 mm Hg/ml/min/kg, respectively; p less than 0.05 versus hypoxic control or warfarin).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to determine the origin of HNE-induced glycoconjugate release from 1-day-old cultures of adult hamster trachea. After confirming that HNE treatment released glycoconjugates from cultures labeled with tritiated glucosamine, light microscopic autoradiograms and electron micrographs were prepared. Untreated cultures and cultures treated with inactivated HNE served as controls. HNE treatment caused a 40 to 50% decrease in the silver grain count on the external apical surfaces of secretory cells (p less than 0.05) and ciliated cells (p less than 0.01). Silver grain counts in secretory and ciliated cell cytoplasm, submucosa, and nontissue background were not significantly different from controls. The percentage of nongranulated secretory cells and the number of secretory granules in granulated secretory cells were similar in the HNE-treated and untreated controls. There was no evidence of constitutive release of radiolabeled glycoproteins, or of discharge of secretory granules from the secretory cells. We conclude that HNE releases mucins and other glycoconjugates from the external surfaces of both secretory and ciliated cells in tracheal organ culture.\r"

Nasal lavages were assayed for the following proteins: albumin, total protein, secretory IgA (sIgA), nonsecretory IgA (serum IgA), and total IgA. Histamine stimulation produced a profound ipsilateral protein secretion enriched in the serum proteins albumin and nonsecretory IgA. Histamine also produced a smaller contralateral protein secretion (about 15% as large as the ipsilateral response) which contained disproportionately elevated concentrations of the glandular protein sIgA. Topical pretreatment with chlorpheniramine (an H-1 antihistamine) completely abrogated the ipsilateral nasal secretory response to histamine. Nasal pretreatment with atropine (a muscarinic antagonist) had no significant effect on ipsilateral nasal secretion and did not alter the capacity of histamine to stimulate contralateral secretions (the nasonasal reflex). Histamine therefore stimulates secretion by both a direct action that increases plasma protein extravasation and by an indirect reflex mechanism that stimulates glandular secretion.\r"

Examination by inverted microscopy revealed that MBP, both the form stabilized by alkylation of sulfhydryl groups as well as the native form of the molecule, ECP, EPO by itself, as well as EPO + H2O2 + halide, but not EDN, cause dose-related damage to the tracheal epithelium. The lowest concentrations of MBP and ECP causing damage were 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. In contrast, EDN, although biochemically similar to ECP, did not damage the tracheal epithelium in concentrations of up to 200 micrograms/ml. MBP caused exfoliation, as well as bleb formation and ciliostasis. EPO in the presence of the H2O2-producing enzyme glucose oxidase (GO), Cl-, 0.11 M, and iodide caused ciliostasis, bleb formation, and exfoliation of epithelial cells at concentrations as low as 1 U/ml (3.9 micrograms/ml). EPO + GO in the presence of Cl-, 0.11 M, alone or with Cl- and l-, 10(-4) M, or Cl- and Br-, 5 x 10(-5) M, were all toxic to epithelium. Surprisingly, EPO by itself caused partial ciliostasis, bleb formation, and exfoliation of epithelial cells in a dose-related manner at concentrations as low as 10 to 30 U/ml (39 to 121 micrograms/ml). These results confirm prior observations showing the toxicity of MBP to tracheal epithelium and indicate that ECP and EPO alone, as well as EPO + GO + halide, cause damage. Thus, several eosinophil granule proteins are able to damage respiratory epithelium.\r"

Eight atopic asthmatic patients (mean PC20 histamine, 0.90 mg/ml) and four nonasthmatic control subjects underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy. All asthmatic subjects were clinically stable for 2 wk prior to bronchoscopy and required either no treatment or inhaled albuterol alone. A single 50-ml bronchial wash was undertaken, followed by endobronchial biopsy of subcarinae. These procedures were repeated in the asthmatic subjects 18 h after bronchial provocation with allergen or methacholine. Subsequently, all subjects underwent bronchial reactivity testing with inhaled histamine. The clinical and physiologic data were not revealed to the pathologist interpreting the specimens. The asthmatic subjects shed a significantly greater number of epithelial cells into the lavage fluid than did the nonasthmatic subjects (7.23 versus 1.48 x 10(4)/ml, p = 0.048). There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between the lavage epithelial cell count and bronchial reactivity (rho = -0.64, p = 0.03). In the asthmatic subjects, but not in the control subjects, there was extensive deposition of collagen beneath the epithelial basement membrane, mast cell degranulation, and mucosal infiltration by eosinophils, which exhibited morphologic evidence of activation. Eosinophils, monocytes, and platelets were found in contact with the vascular endothelium, with emigration of eosinophils and monocytes in the asthmatic subjects. These changes were found irrespective of bronchial challenge with allergen. We conclude that allergic asthma is accompanied by extensive inflammatory changes in the airways, even in mild clinical and subclinical disease.\r"

Respondents contributed more months of data with the questionnaire than with the diary method. Respiratory symptom and illness rates, as determined for the first year by each of the methods, were compared for 277 children who had less than 4 months of missing data. Respondents from families with more children tended to report a lower total respiratory illness rate by the diary than by the questionnaire method (p = 0.006). Although upper respiratory illness rates did not differ by method, lower respiratory illnesses were reported more frequently (p = 0.0001) by questionnaire than by diary. In the group of 49 children who were identified as having had greater than one lower respiratory illness, 25% of the illnesses reported as having been lower respiratory by questionnaire were reported as having been another form of respiratory illness by diary. For this group the ratio of 3:1 of boys to girls for the diary as compared with 1.5:1 for the questionnaire suggests the presence of reporting bias and no comparability of methods. Standardization of an acute respiratory illness questionnaire would provide greater opportunity than use of diaries for synthesis of prospective data from different epidemiologic studies.\r"

DESIGN: Surveillance of clinical enterococcal isolates, in-vitro susceptibility and timed survival studies, and determination of antibiotic efficacy in an experimental model of enterococcal endocarditis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For a 6-month period, 14% of enterococcal isolates (30 of 212) were identified as E. faecium. One third of the isolates were highly resistant to penicillin G (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], greater than or equal to 200 micrograms/mL) but did not produce beta-lactamase. The findings from in-vitro survival studies showed that this high-level resistance resulted in the loss of bactericidal activity normally observed when an aminoglycoside antibiotic agent is combined with penicillin. An experimental rat model of endocarditis provided in-vivo data that confirmed our in-vitro observations. After the rats received therapy for 72 hours, penicillin G either alone or in combination with gentamicin did not significantly decrease the numbers of enterococci in vegetations on heart valves compared with untreated controls (P = 0.62 and P = 0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus faecium accounts for a notable proportion of clinical enterococcal isolates. Many strains from patients at our institution, as well as from patients at other institutions throughout the country, are highly resistant to penicillin. Because high-level penicillin resistance has important therapeutic implications, periodic surveillance and MIC testing of significant enterococcal isolates, especially E. faecium, are suggested.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective survey of patients for a median period of 33 months. SETTING: Neuroendocrine clinical center of a referral-based university medical center. INTERVENTIONS: Reversal of hyperprolactinemia by bromocriptine therapy, transsphenoidal surgery, or radiation therapy, alone or in combination. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 20 male patients with prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients who had a reversal of hyperprolactinemia and a restoration of gonadal function, a significant increase in bone density of the radial shaft was noted (mean +/- SE, 0.77 +/- 0.03 to 0.84 +/- 0.03 g/cm2; P less than or equal to 0.05). These patients also had a minimal change in the density of vertebral bone (109 +/- 9 to 115 +/- 10 mg of potassium phosphate, dibasic/cm3). Patients who remained hypogonadal despite the reversal of hyperprolactinemia had no change in radial (0.76 +/- 0.03 to 0.76 +/- 0.04 g/cm2) or vertebral bone density (105 +/- 10 to 103 +/- 9 mg of potassium phosphate, dibasic/cm3). There was a positive correlation between the change in testosterone level and the change in radial (r = 0.67, P less than or equal to 0.003) or vertebral bone density (r = 0.70, P less than or equal to 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The reversal of hypogonadism, independent of the prolactin concentration, is associated with an improvement in bone mass. Our findings emphasize the importance of gonadal steroids in maintaining skeletal integrity in men.\r"

The central problem is the inability to derive an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect when differences occur because of the different sequences in which treatments are applied. This problem can be traced to a deficiency of the logic of the crossover arrangement itself. Factors that can invalidate the findings of a crossover trial include nonuniform pharmacologic and psychologic carry-over effects, failure to return patients to their baseline state before the crossover, nonuniform changes in the patients over time, and the use of time-dependent response measures. When these problems can be anticipated, a parallel-groups design should be used instead of a crossover trial.\r"

We present our protocol for management of these difficult surgical patients, including vigorous hydration and transfusion therapy. Polysomnography has proven valuable both in diagnosis and in identifying severely affected patients. Increased end tidal alveolar carbon dioxide during sleep has proven to be a significant predictor of disease, while oxygen saturation monitoring was shown to be unreliable. The incidence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy (ATH) in SCD appears increased and not related to infectious diseases. We suggest that ATH represents a part of the natural course of compensatory lymphoid tissue enlargement in children with SCD.\r"

A predetermined aliquot of the toxin was injected into the cricothyroid muscle of ten dogs, the duration of its effectiveness was noted, and repeated injections were given the animals. Biopsies of the injected muscles were obtained in three of the animals for routine histologic and electron microscopic studies. The effects of the toxin were recorded by cinelaryngoscopy and videotape documentation. In all the dogs, the true vocal cord was lateralized effectively and there was no morbidity, dysphagia, aspiration, or deaths. This study also confirms that the effects of the toxin in the canine larynx are spontaneously reversed and that multiple injections do not cause irreparable damage to the laryngeal muscles.\r"

In the 13 years from January 1972 through December 1984, there were 187 patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis at the University of Virginia Medical Center. One hundred forty-eight patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy as the initial management. The 3-year disease-free survival for the irradiated population was 93.6% in stage I and 75.5% in stage II. Twenty patients had recurrences following radiotherapy, and 13 of 20 were successfully surgically salvaged for an overall determinate survival of 100% in stage I and 85.7% in stage II at 3 years. These statistics are comparable to those from our previous 16-year review of 147 patients from 1956 through 1971. Factors of prognostic significance were persistent hoarseness after radiotherapy, impaired cord mobility, subglottic extension, and multiple sites of involvement in stage I. We conclude that definitive radiotherapy offers excellent survival and that a majority of the small number of treatment failures can be managed with surgical salvage.\r"

Dinitrochlorobenzene challenge tests were positive in 33% (8/24) of severe cases, in 95% (82/86) of moderate cases, and in 100% (40/40) of mild cases, indicating that DNCB contact sensitivity is diminished only in patients with AD who have extensive skin lesions. Of the 20 patients who were nonreactive on the first DNCB challenge tests, 18 became reactive on the second challenge tests that were performed at the time when the dermatitis was well controlled. It is likely that the suppressed contact sensitivity seen in patients with AD is secondary to the disease.\r"

There were no associated systemic abnormalities. The lesions resolved after months to years, leaving no scars. We propose that this condition is a form of perioral dermatitis with granulomatous histologic features, which can be distinguished from sarcoidosis and other facial eruptions in childhood both on clinical and histologic grounds.\r"

Notable abnormalities included low levels of plasma iron and zinc (in junctional EB and recessive dystrophic EB), vitamin C (primarily in EB simplex), vitamin A (in junctional and recessive dystrophic EB), vitamin B12 (primarily in EB simplex), and vitamin B6 (especially in recessive dystrophic EB). With the exception of low plasma iron and zinc levels in junctional and recessive dystrophic EB, however, only a minority of patients in any of the EB subsets had low levels of most of the other nutrients, and an apparent correlation with malabsorption was possible with only selected nutrients.\r"

Twenty-one patients had positive blood cultures for Brucella melitensis. A disseminated violet-erythematous, papulonodular eruption (20 cases) and erythema nodosum-like lesions (three cases) were the most frequent eruptions observed, appearing during the initial episode of the disease or in relapse. Histologic findings were a dermal inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes in a perivascular and periadnexal arrangement, with a focally granulomatous appearance, and occasional extension to subcutaneous fat. Skin cultures were positive for B melitensis in two of four cases. Our results suggest that there are characteristic clinical and histologic cutaneous findings in patients with brucellosis and that hematogenous spread of the microorganism can be the most important pathogenic mechanism of these lesions.\r"

Clinically, these were solitary, asymptomatic, 2- to 6-mm, flesh-colored papules, usually located on the face of middle-aged patients. The correct diagnosis was rarely made; the lesion was most often mistaken for a basal cell epithelioma, melanocytic nevus, or other benign tumor. Light microscopy revealed single or multiple encapsulated dermal lobules composed of interlacing Schwann cells. Variable numbers of fine axons and myelin sheath remnants were present. Palisading of nuclei was not a prominent feature. Electron microscopy demonstrated substantial numbers of class C fibers (mostly nonmyelinated) only partially enveloped by Schwann cell cytoplasm. Pathologically, palisaded encapsulated neuromas are distinctive true neuromas resembling those seen in the multiple mucosal neuroma syndrome. Electron-microscopic findings are similar to those seen in peripheral nerve regeneration, suggesting that palisaded encapsulated neuromas may be traumatic in origin, and could represent regeneration following local minor injury to the skin.\r"

Admissions varied unpredictably over periods of a few days, but there was a repeated yearly pattern of peaks and troughs with an interval of several weeks. The short term variation could be attributed to chance effects alone, excluding any important role for short term influences--for example, weather changes--in precipitating asthma admissions. There was a definite association between the longer term variation and school holidays. The admission rate fell during holidays and there were two or more peaks during terms. The pattern is consistent with a largely viral aetiology for asthmatic attacks throughout the year. We postulate that school holidays disrupt the spread of viral infections in a community, with synchronisation of subsequent attacks. Travel during holidays may facilitate acquisition of new viral strains by the community.\r"

The median gestational age at birth was 29 weeks, and the median birth weight was 1310 g. Hyaline membrane disease was the indication for neonatal ventilation in 25 children. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed from radiographs in 11 infants (27%). Airway obstruction was observed in 10 of 11 children who had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in nine of 29 children who had not. After inhalation of terbutaline, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was significantly increased. General hyperinflation was found in 16 of 17 children with abnormal chest radiographs (eight who had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nine who had not). Functional residual capacity was significantly higher in children with abnormal radiographs. Each child had a normal maximum working capacity and a normal electrocardiogram, and all but two had normal vectorcardiograms. Oxygen saturation at maximum work load decreased significantly in both groups of children. The risk of future respiratory problems calls for further follow up of lung function and chest radiography.\r"

In addition factors were investigated which might be stressful or which helped staff to manage in difficult circumstances. Three quarters were under comparatively little stress and in general showed very few psychological symptoms but a distinct subgroup were under a great deal of stress. A number of factors, notably recent personal bereavement and unresolved grief about a death that had occurred before they came to work at the hospice, distinguished this small group. Job satisfaction was generally high. The main sources of stress were: the sense of impotence staff felt when they were unable to relieve perceived needs or distress; dealing with negative responses in families, and conflicts within the staff group. The most important mitigating factors were: the informal support that staff provided for each other in this small cohesive working unit, the homelike atmosphere of the hospice, and the diversity of professional and personal skills among the staff group. The implications of these findings for reducing stress among staff dealing with dying people are discussed; this includes not only staff on paediatric wards, intensive care and neonatal units, but also community paediatric nurses.\r"

The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, tense anterior fontanelles, splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins. Half the infantile cases of hydrocephalus were without symptoms, and a quarter of the cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs. There were no fewer than 33 different clinical signs including several unusual ones, such as macular rash and sweating. We believe that the presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intraventricular pressure is sufficiently variable, unusual, or even absent to justify the direct measurement of intracranial pressure.\r"

Two overnight urine samples were collected and the protein excretion measured and expressed as the geometric mean of the protein to creatinine ratio (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, urinary retinol binding protein:creatinine ratio, and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase:creatinine ratio, respectively). The excretion of all three proteins was significantly higher in the diabetic children with 15 (25%) of urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, 16 (27%) of urinary retinol binding protein:creatinine ratio, and 43 (72%) of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase:creatinine ratio values being above the normal range. Significant correlations were observed between urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and urinary retinol binding protein:creatinine ratio, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase:creatinine ratio, and urinary retinol binding protein:creatinine ratio and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase:creatinine ratio. There were also significant correlations between glycated haemoglobin 1c (HbA1c) and these proteins, especially N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. No correlations were observed with the fractional excretion of sodium, flow rate of urine, glomerular filtration rate, or blood pressure. These data show that tubular abnormalities are present early in the course of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and suggest that the early increase in urinary excretion of albumin may be at least partly tubular in origin, and that glycaemic control may influence this aspect of proximal tubular function.\r"

These five patients were treated with subcutaneous calcium diethylene triamine pentacetic acid (Ca-DTPA) with zinc supplements instead of desferrioxamine, and their hearing improved during periods of seven to 19 months. Their serum ion concentrations remained unchanged. We suggest that all patients receiving long term desferrioxamine should have audiometric assessments at 6-12 monthly intervals. Ca-DTPA with oral zinc supplements should be considered as alternative to desferrioxamine as an iron chelating treatment in patients with auditory neurotoxicity.\r"

Children with asthma or other respiratory diseases had lower peak expiratory flow rates, and younger children living in rural areas had higher rates. In 2828 healthy children the peak expiratory flow rate increased with age, height, and weight. There was an increase in the slope of this line for both age and height--at 12 years and 145 cm in girls, and at 14 years and 155 cm in boys. This continued for two to three years and 15 cm, respectively, before it declined. Previous surveys have obscured this change associated with height by reporting small numbers and using linear regression analysis. This type of analysis can underestimate the mean peak expiratory flow rate of small children by half to one standard deviation. A centile graph against age is recommended to describe normal values and their differences.\r"

In both groups, 177 aspirates (more than 90%) obtained during the first week of ventilation were sterile. Thereafter, colonisation with mixed Gram positive flora emerged followed by growth of Gram negative bacilli. For the infants who developed sepsis, the correlation between pathogens isolated from blood during the episodes of sepsis and those from previous endotracheal tube isolates was poor; in only five of the 26 cases of sepsis (19%) was the same single strain of organism isolated from culture of the blood and of the endotracheal tube aspirate. Other markers of infection such as endotracheal tube aspirate white blood cell counts and changes in bacterial flora were not useful in predicting systemic infection. Routine surveillance cultures of endotracheal tube aspirates in ventilated infants are not helpful in predicting the pathogens that are isolated from the blood during episodes of sepsis.\r"

A total of 153 women booking at the antenatal clinic were found to have haemoglobin S. The protocol required that all partners of the women so identified be screened for abnormal haemoglobins and beta thalassaemia trait, and that the babies of these women should have cord blood electrophoresis performed. In fact this was only achieved in 75 partners (49%) and 91 of 145 infants (63%). Of 10 babies born with sickle cell disease during the study period, nine had mothers known to have haemoglobin S or C, but only four of these mothers' partners had been tested before delivery of the child. This pilot study highlights the problems in establishing effective antenatal screening programmes, especially in ethnic minority groups. The results show that detailed staff training, careful organisation of administrative arrangements, and education of 'at risk' groups should all be undertaken before the launching of major screening initiatives.\r"

Indomethacin in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight was infused over five minutes in one group of infants (20 doses) and over 20 minutes in a second group of infants (16 doses). There were no significant differences between the two groups in birth weight (mean = 1068 g, range 569-1950), gestational age (mean 28.4 weeks, range 25-31), or postnatal age (mean 18.1 days, range 6-42). There was a significant reduction in both the Doppler mean flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery (mean (SE) -20 (4.2)%) and peak amplitude of cerebral electrical impedance (-26 (3.9)%) within two minutes of starting the indomethacin infusion over five minutes. There was no significant change after the infusion over 20 minutes. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or carbon dioxide tensions after infusion at either rate. The results suggest that infusion of indomethacin over five minutes caused a potentially deleterious reduction in cerebral blood flow. No such reduction occurred when it was infused over 20 minutes.\r"

Two patients have subsequently undergone surgery, and six other patients continue long-term stent placement with marked reduction of chronic pain or attacks of recurrent pancreatitis. All six pseudocysts resolved, although one recurred and required surgery. It is concluded that pancreatic drains or stents may obviate the need for surgery, temporize before definitive therapy, or direct a subsequent surgical procedure.\r"

Over a 6-year period, 728 patients with primary or secondary biliary tract disease were admitted to the First Surgical Department, landeskrankenanstalten, Salzburg, Austria. If, based on preoperative screening, the possibility of common bile duct stones (CBDS) existed, the patients were subjected to ERCP-ST EXTR. Two to 4 days later, these patients underwent a simple cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram and functional manometry. Evaluation criteria for this study were morbidity, mortality, and retained stone (RST) rates. The overall complication rate for the entire series was 6%. In patients who underwent operative common duct stone removal (n = 78), the complication rate amounted to 21.8%. The rate was reduced to 2.1% by ERCP-ST EXTR. The RST rate was likewise reduced from 2.2% to 0.5% by ERCP-ST EXTR. Mortality in patients with CBDS fell from 3.8% to 1% through the use of this method. In those patients with secondary stones who were treated by ERCP-ST EXTR only, morbidity was 2%, the RST rate was 0%, and mortality was 0%. It is concluded that selective ERCP-ST EXTR, followed by simple cholecystectomy, is a suitable treatment protocol and that this approach may reduce complication and mortality rates.\r"

During the late follow-up period, the glucose metabolism was unchanged in 80.7% of the patients, in 13.7% it deteriorated, and in 5.5% it improved permanently; 80% of the patients experienced a marked increase in weight averaging 8.7 kg. Compared with the Whipple procedure, the duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas spares the patient with chronic pancreatitis a gastrectomy, duodenectomy, and resection of the extrahepatic biliary ducts. In terms of a subtotal resection, the limited operative intervention at the head of the pancreas and the preservation of the duodenum explain the low early and late postoperative morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and pathologic data from 73 patients with unresectable carcinoma of the pancreas treated from 1980 to 1987 were reviewed to evaluate the efficacy of biliary enteric bypass and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction. Fifty-two patients underwent biliary enteric bypass with no operative deaths and with a 15% operative morbidity. These patients had a median postoperative hospitalization of 12 days. Four patients (8%) eventually developed recurrent jaundice, and three of these were successfully treated with PTBD. The median survival for these 52 patients was 7 months. Twenty-one patients underwent PTBD with an 81% technical-success rate. These patients had a 33% early complication rate and a 33% in-hospital mortality. The median hospitalization was 13 days postdrainage. Of the 14 patients surviving the initial hospitalization, 86% developed late complications requiring 16 hospital admissions and ten emergency room visits for a total of 155 days of hospitalization. The median survival for those patients undergoing PTBD was 4 months from the time of diagnosis and 2 months from the time of catheter drainage. Surgical bypass offers excellent palliation for malignant biliary obstruction with extremely low morbidity and mortality in properly selected patients; PTBD is useful in the treatment of those patients with extensive disease, who are poor surgical candidates, or who have failed previous surgical drainage. There is a role for both of these palliative procedures in the management of patients with biliary obstruction from pancreatic cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) on the gastric mucosa of rats subjected to 1, 2, and 24 hours of water immersion stress were examined histologically. Results indicated a time-related increase in the total percentage length of glandular mucosa injured in normal saline (NS) pretreated rats that was significantly attenuated by subcutaneous dmPGE2 pretreatment (5 micrograms/kg) after 1 hour (46.0 +/- 12.9 vs. 16.8 +/- 2.3; p less than 0.005), 2 hours (45.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 13.8 +/- 2.2; p less than 0.001), and 24 hours (93.1 +/- 2.6 vs. 65.1 +/- 7.0; p less than 0.005) of water immersion stress. Moreover, dmPGE2 essentially prevented the occurrence of deep, glandular injury that, in NS controls, involved approximately 13% and 26% of the mucosal surface after 2 and 24 hours of immersion stress, respectively. Additionally, tissue levels of glutathione (mumole/g weight of wet tissue) were measured to determine its role under such conditions. After 1 hour of stress, there were no differences in glutathione levels between NS or dmPGE2 pretreated animals and fasted controls. After 2 and 24 hours of stress, there were likewise no differences in glutathione levels between NS and dmPGE2 pretreated groups, although levels in both groups were significantly decreased from fasted controls by approximately 30% at 2 hours and 37-47% after 24 hours. These histologic and biochemical data indicate that dmPGE2 attenuates both the extent and depth of glandular mucosal injury and does so in a manner unrelated to alterations in glutathione levels in gastric epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "This report attempts to elucidate the manner in which the surgical margin is linked to a recurrence after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. Forty patients were divided into two groups: those in whom the margin from the cut surface to HCC in the fresh resected specimen was less than 10 mm wide, and patients in whom the surgical margin was equal to or exceeded 10 mm. These margins were expressed as tumor wedge positive [TW(+)], and tumor wedge negative [TW(-)], respectively. There were 24 and 16 patients in the TW(+) and TW(-) groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in clinicopathologic variables, except for age and values of serum albumin between the two groups. There was a recurrence in ten of 24 patients (42%) of the TW(+) group and in eight of 16 patients (50%) of the TW(-) group. Mean disease-free periods were 21.4 months in the TW(+) group and 23.6 months in TW(-) group. These 40 patients were also divided with regard to the time of recurrence, the early recurrence within 24 months, and the late recurrence after 24 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of recurrence and mean disease-free period between the TW(+) and TW(-) groups in the early and late recurrence groups. In both the TW(+) and TW(-) groups, there were no recurrences in 13 of 16 patients (81.3%) with a tumor less than 4 cm in diameter, yet there were recurrences in seven of eight patients (87.5%) with a tumor exceeding 4 cm in diameter, regardless of the time to recurrence. These results suggest that in patients with a tumor less than 4 cm, the extent of TW is not linked to an early recurrence. However, when the tumor size exceeds 4 cm, 10 mm of TW is inadequate to achieve curability. When a wide resection is not feasible, then adjuvant chemotherapy should be aggressive.\r"
