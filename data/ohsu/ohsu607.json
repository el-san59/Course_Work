  ".W": "We studied blood transfusion variables and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in 385 infants admitted to the Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, neonatal intensive care unit over 14 months. Cytomegalovirus antibody titers were measured at birth and monthly thereafter. Urine cultures for CMV were performed regularly. Infants admitted in the first six months (n = 197) received conventionally prepared blood. Infants admitted in the remaining eight months (n = 188) were given frozen, deglycerolized blood. Of the 105 infants weighing 1250 g or less (low birth weight [LBW]), 90 (86%) received transfusions. Two hundred eighty infants weighed more than 1250 g (non-LBW), and 111 (40%) of these were given blood. In the first six months of the study, three infants had CMV viruria. One case was congenital; two were acquired. Both infants who acquired infection were antibody-positive at birth and received multiple transfusions. In the remaining eight months, five infants had CMV viruria. Two cases were congenital; three were acquired. The three infants who acquired infection were antibody-positive at birth and received multiple transfusions. Our study demonstrates that infants with an LBW are more likely to receive blood transfusion and to be given significantly more blood than non-LBW infants. There was no difference in the number of infants acquiring CMV in the two periods despite the use of different preparations of blood.\r"

  ".U": "89022994\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that in the cat, taurine is an osmoprotective molecule that lessens mortality, neurological morbidity, and brain-cell dehydration during chronic hypernatremic dehydration. We examined the ability of two taurine analogues to afford cerebral osmoprotection in rats. Pretreatment with guanidinoethane sulfonate, a competitive antagonist for beta-amino acid transport, as a 1% drinking solution for ten days led to a significant reduction in brain-cell dehydration. Thus, total brain-cell water was higher in experimental vs control animals (544.3 +/- 36.8 vs 478.2 +/- 12.7 mL/100 g of fat-free dry solids [FFDS]) and the difference was almost exclusively derived from the intracellular water compartment (452.7 +/- 27.3 vs 371.4 +/- 7.7 mL/100 g of FFDS). Pretreatment with taltrimide, a lipophilic taurine derivative (intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg for four days), led to similar results. Total brain-tissue water was significantly higher in experimental vs control rats (507.6 +/- 18.8 vs 363.2 +/- 9.5 mL/100 g of FFDS), with the difference primarily derived from the intracellular water space (372.8 +/- 18.1 vs 221.3 +/- 13.1 mL/100 g of FFDS). These results suggest that the cerebral response to chronic hypertonic stress includes accelerated transmembrane flux of osmoprotective solutes in addition to mobilization from sequestered intracellular storage sites in an attempt to increase the cytosolic pool of osmotically active molecules.\r"

Forty-three children received 24 Gy (group 1) and 18 children received 18 Gy (group 2). Height was evaluated at diagnosis, at the end of treatment, and 6, 12, and 24 months later. Growth hormone release was evaluated by arginine and levodopa tests after the end of treatment. After diagnosis, the height SD score decreased significantly in both groups; two years after the end of treatment, only group 1 showed an SD score for height that was still significantly lower than at diagnosis. Group 1 showed impaired GH responses to the tests and, compared with controls, group 1 in fact included a percentage of subjects with a normal response to levodopa (ie, greater than 8 micrograms/L) that was significantly lower (56.4% vs 83.3%) and a percentage of nonresponders to both tests that was significantly higher (21.6% vs 0%). These data indicate that only patients treated with lower cranial irradiation dosage (18 Gy) had complete growth recovery and normal GH responses to pharmacologic tests.\r"

All patients but one were misdiagnosed as having an organic disease prior to our final diagnosis. Five children were treated with medications for presumed organic illnesses. In all of these children a diagnosis of HCR was made on the basis of their history and neurological examination findings. They all recovered or began recovery within a few days of having HCR diagnosed, and none of them had had a relapse three to 11 months after the diagnosis of HCR was made. We believe, and there is ample evidence in the literature, that a positive diagnosis of HCR in childhood can be made when neurological manifestations cannot be explained on an anatomic and physiological basis. Although absence of an obvious organic cause is a helpful clue, exhaustive exclusion of all possible organic causes is not necessary for the diagnosis of HCR.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated a prevalence of the fra(X) syndrome as high as 6% in institutionalized retarded males. The physical and behavioral predictors of positive findings from cytogenetic testing have not been clarified, since many features of the fra(X) syndrome are found in other retarded populations. We performed physical and cytogenetic examinations on 440 patients at the Wheat Ridge (Colo) Regional Center. Twenty-eight (6.3%) demonstrated abnormal karyotypes. Seventeen of these were autosomal abnormalities or sex chromosome aneuploidies and 11 demonstrated the fra(X) chromosome (seven males, four females). In males, the physical features that were predictive of the fra(X) syndrome included the combination of ear lengths of 7.0 cm or greater, macroorchidism of 30 mL or greater, and the presence of hand calluses or lesions secondary to hand biting. The fra(X) chromosome was not seen in spastic quadriplegic patients. All seven males with the fra(X) syndrome were detected among the 141 ambulatory males who resided in the highest functioning units at this institution.\r"

Intraventricular hemorrhage, which occurred in 90 infants (29.8%), was correlated with the lowest platelet count obtained during the first 4 days of life. In 27 infants with intraventricular hemorrhage, the lowest platelet count was less than 100 X 10(9)/L. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated that reduced platelet count was not associated significantly with intraventricular hemorrhage. Similarly, the severity of intraventricular hemorrhage did not correlate with the lowest platelet count. These data suggest that a reduced platelet count does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of intraventricular hemorrhage in infants of very low birth weight.\r"

Indications for FFB; weight and age of the patient; and procedure format, including medication usage, findings, specimen results, and complications, were analyzed. Evaluation of previously diagnosed subglottic stenosis and airway abnormalities were the two most common indications (33% and 32%, respectively). Persistent or recurrent infiltrates or atelectasis, need for cultures, stridor, failure to extubate, hoarseness, and persistent wheeze were also cited. Endoscopic diagnoses included adenoidal hypertrophy, laryngomalacia, vocal cord abnormalities, interarytenoid membrane, subglottic stenosis, granulomas, tracheobronchomalacia, stenosis, obstruction, generalized inflammation/edema, polyps, tracheal bronchi, and anomalous bronchial anatomy. Cytomegalovirus, pneumococcus, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, or mixed gram-negative flora were isolated from some patients without tracheostomy. Minor complications (transient bradycardia, mild nasopharyngeal bleeding, and mild worsening of upper airway obstruction) occurred in 3.1% of procedures, but no severe complications occurred. Management was directly affected by procedure results in 41% of procedures. We concluded that the FFB can be a safe, useful procedure in the management of children with BPD.\r"

Calcitonin deficiency was documented by two attempts to stimulate calcitonin secretion with intravenous calcium and pentagastrin. Treatment for 11 months with daily subcutaneous injections of human calcitonin and oral administration of calcitriol failed to reduce the excessive bone resorption observed on bone biopsy, and the fracture rate did not decrease. Treatment was discontinued for two months, then resumed with calcitonin injections and oral calcium supplementation. The fracture rate decreased but bone biopsy continued to show excessive resorption. Therapy was discontinued. After the onset of puberty, endogenous calcitonin was detectable. Exogenous calcitonin therapy may have failed to control bone resorption for several reasons: insufficient dose, reduction of bone receptors from long-term calcitonin exposure, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or lack of association between calcitonin deficiency and the bone disease.\r"

For jails that housed a daily population of about 1,000 prisoners, an average of 4.4 deaths were observed annually. Men predominated, and racial makeup paralleled the general prison population. Seizures, alcohol-related illness, and cardiovascular disease caused over half of the natural deaths. All suicides were accomplished by hanging. Over two-thirds of the incidents that led to death occurred in the prisoner's cell, and about one-half of the victims were found dead in their cells. Two-thirds of those who died in custody had been arrested for crimes in which persons were not harmed, while nearly two-thirds of those committing suicide had been arrested for crimes against persons. Deaths in custody are expected events, and familiarity with the circumstances under which they occur should be helpful in enabling prison managers to establish policies and procedures to minimize their occurrence.\r"

Directions that can be obtained by contacting the manufacturer fail to give any recommendations on the amount of heat applied during gelatin preparation and do not mention the detrimental effects of excess heat. These oversights are corrected in the revised set of directions included in this article.\r"

Data on current metabolic, medical, psychological, and vocational function status were obtained. Neuropsychological (NP) measures included the Number Cancellation Protocol (NCP), Trailmaking test forms A and B (TMT A, TMT B), Symbol Digit Modalities (SDM), and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The CAPD subject group had consistently more efficient cognitive function than the CHD subject group. Regardless of modality, the groups of subjects under age 51 and those who were vocationally active had significantly better NP performance. No cognitive function differences were found in groups categorized by sex or duration of dialysis. Creatinine levels were more highly correlated with NP scores than were BUN levels, with higher creatinine levels associated with better cognitive function. Serum calcium, CO2, total protein, albumin, and SGOT levels also were correlated with NP scores. CAPD may be more effective than HD in reversing uremic encephalopathy by mechanisms mostly unrelated to serum creatinine and BUN levels. Longitudinal studies will be needed to determine if dialysis modality is an independent factor in the degree of reversal of uremic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of increasing intraabdominal pressure on left ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), we studied 15 patients who had been on CAPD for at least 2 months. The study protocol included measurement of echocardiographic LV internal dimensions in diastole and systole, LV wall thickness and mass, LV ejection time, the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (mean Vcf), heart rate, BP, and intraabdominal pressure. Measurements were obtained at baseline (OL) and following intraperitoneal infusion of 1-L increments of dialysate solution (up to 4 L) in both the recumbent and standing positions. Significant differences in LV systolic function resulting from intraperitoneal infusion of dialysate were confined to the subgroup with increased LV wall thickness (n = 8). In this subgroup, mean Vcf decreased progressively from 0.99 +/- 0.18 circumferences/second at baseline to 0.88 +/- 0.16 circumferences/second at 1 L (P = NS), to 0.86 +/- 0.16 circumferences/second at 2 L (P = NS), to 0.66 +/- 0.18 circumferences/second at 3 L (P less than 0.005), and to 0.60 +/- 0.14 circumferences/second at 4 L (P less than 0.005) in recumbent position. Measurements obtained in the standing position paralleled those observed during recumbency. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in the mean LV internal dimension in diastole and a significant increase in intraabdominal pressure, but no significant change in the mean LV internal dimensions in systole, mean heart rate, or mean systolic or diastolic BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The infants were the appropriate size for gestational age and demonstrated no obvious physical abnormalities. Laboratory data, including renal function, was also within normal limits. Renal size in the two infants studied by ultrasound was near or above the 95th percentile when corrected for gestational age.

All patients presenting with peritonitis (n = 90) were randomized to receive either continuous or intermittent vancomycin therapy. Patients in whom gram negative organisms and fungi were identified by microscopy and culture were transferred to therapy with a more appropriate antibiotic (n = 39). In the remainder (n = 51), CAPD peritonitis was treated solely with vancomycin (continuous, n = 21; intermittent, n = 30). Clinical resolution was seen in all patients, requiring a mean of 3.2 days for macroscopic clearing of dialysate effluent. Recurrence of peritonitis within 1 month of cessation of therapy was unusual and did not vary between treatment protocols (4/21 v 3/30; P = NS). There were no differences in observed side effects. Thus, IP vancomycin proved to be a useful single agent therapy for gram positive and no organism CAPD peritonitis. Therapy with two IP doses was effective and as safe as continuous IP vancomycin therapy, and therefore should replace other vancomycin administration schedules in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis.\r"

Hemoglobinuria and anuric acute renal failure (ARF) ensued. Urinalysis revealed countless Charcot-Leyden crysals (CLC). This is the only known report of Charcot-Leyden crystalluria. The CLC protein (lysophospholipase) should normally undergo glomerular filtration and catabolism by the tubules during reabsorption. Its abundant presence in the urine of our patient may reflect impairment of tubular reabsorption, saturation of the tubular reabsorptive process by excessive CLC load through residual functioning glomeruli, or a combination thereof. The extreme degree of hypereosinophilia suggests a massive load of CLC protein and acute tubular necrosis implies impaired tubular function, so both mechanisms should have been operative. At the autopsy, no eosinophilic infiltrates were present in the kidneys, which points against a local spillage of CLC protein into the tubules.\r"

Under classical ascertainment assumptions, estimation of genetic parameters cannot be separated from estimation of the parameters of the ascertainment process, so that any misspecification of the ascertainment process causes biases in estimation of the genetic parameters. Ewens and Shute proposed a resolution to this problem, involving conditioning the likelihood of the sample on the part of the data which is \"relevant to ascertainment.\" The usefulness of this approach can only be assessed by examining the properties (in particular, bias and standard error) of the estimates which arise by using it for a wide range of parameter values and family size distributions and then comparing these biases and standard errors with those arising under classical ascertainment procedures. These comparisons are carried out in the present paper, and we also compare the proposed method with procedures which condition on, or ignore, parts of the data.\r"

  ".W": "In human genetics, two loci are declared to be linked when the lod score at the maximum likelihood recombination fraction theta exceeds the threshold of 3.0. Since recombination rates differ between the sexes, one can alternatively detect linkage by estimating separate recombination rates, theta m and theta f, for male and female meiosis and examining the corresponding sex-specific lod scores. The question arises: In order to maintain the same chance of falsely declaring linkage, what is the correct threshold for declaring linkage when sex-specific lod scores are used? We show here that the appropriate threshold is about 3.5. If the restriction that theta f greater than theta m is added, the appropriate threshold falls to about 3.25. We also discuss the relative efficiency of detecting linkage by using sex-specific and sex-averaged lod scores.\r"

  ".W": "A \"newly detected\" variant of methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) reductase (E.C.1.1.1.68) deficiency associated with an 8-15-fold increase in plasma total homocysteine was discovered in two unrelated patients who had subnormal serum folate. However, the homocysteinemia was corrected by oral folic acid supplement. When MTHF reductase activities in lymphocyte extracts before and after heat treatment at 46 C for 5 min were compared, there was a consistent difference in heat stability between the enzyme from the controls and that from the patients. The mean residual activities after heat treatment were 37.0% (34.1%-42.6%) in the controls and 15.2% and 15.1% in the two patients, respectively. Two obligate heterozygotes for severe MTHF reductase deficiency had residual activities of 39.6% and 37.7%. A similar difference in thermostability was demonstrated in cultured skin fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. Studies with a mixture of lymphoblast extracts from a control and a patient and with partially purified enzyme suggested that the thermostability was an independent characteristic of MTHF reductase. These observations provided evidence of a hitherto undescribed mutant MTHF reductase in our two patients with intermediate homocysteinemia. Unlike previously reported patients with MTHF reductase deficiency, there was no apparent clinical problem related to the abnormal folate or homocysteine metabolism during infancy or childhood in these two subjects, but one of them had vascular disorders in adulthood. The observations in these two subjects suggested that a moderate deficiency of MTHF reductase might be associated with vascular disorders in adult life.\r"

An excess of A2B over A2, noted in some black populations and among the Japanese, though not in caucasoids, is inconsistent with the classical Mendelian mode of inheritance of the allelic A1 and A2 genes. Characterization of the enzymatic properties of the blood group A and B enzymes in the serum has shown that serological A2B blood of some blacks contains A1 enzyme and a superactive B* enzyme. An excess of A2B found in a study of over 15,000 residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki prompted investigation of the characteristics of the A and B enzymes in 60 blood samples, 37 from individuals in 13 unrelated families and 23 from other unrelated individuals in the two cities. Among 27 unrelated individuals whose blood types were unequivocally classified serologically as A2B, 15 were confirmed as A2B enzymatically; eight contained A1 and B* enzymes, not A2 or B enzymes, thus being A1B*; two contained Aint and B* enzymes, thus being AintB; and results for the remaining two were ambiguous. Hiroshima differs from Nagasaki in the frequency of the A2B serological type and also in the occurrence of the B* enzyme, Nagasaki having a higher proportion of both. If one considers those cases in which family study was possible, the transmission of the B* enzyme appears to be compatible with the Mendelian mode of inheritance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We show that exposure of FA fibroblasts to hypoxic (5% v/v oxygen) culture conditions restores their growth in vitro to near normal. Exposure to elevated oxygen tension (35% v/v) causes accumulations of FA cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle that are in significant excess of those seen in heterozygote and control strains. In the absence of evidence for defective cytoplasmatic radical scavenging systems, these observations suggest increased nuclear susceptibility to ambient oxygen as cause of the FA cellular phenotype.\r"

We now report that the gene encoding the 5-8 kDa hydrophobic surfactant protein SP-C is located on the short arm of chromosome 8. A cDNA clone encoding the entire protein recognizes a useful EcoRI restriction-site-length polymorphism. Evaluation of congenital syndromes manifesting autosomal abnormalities does not further elucidate the functional role of this protein in promoting normal respiratory physiology.\r"

Apart from the Xp21 band, where numerous deletions have been found that encompass the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, an increasing number of deletions and duplications have been observed that span (part of) the Xq21 segment. To refine the molecular and genetic map of this region, we have employed 52 cloned single-copy DNA sequences from the Xcen-q22 segment to characterize two partly overlapping tandem duplications and two interstitial deletions on the proximal long arm of the human X chromosome. Together with a panel of somatic cell hybrids that had been described earlier, these four rearrangements enabled us to order the 52 probes into nine different groups and to narrow the regional assignment of several genes, including those for tapetochoroidal dystrophy and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.\r"

The main symptoms are poor sight; radial, cystic macula degeneration; and peripheral superficial retinal detachment. The disease is quite common in Finland, where at least 300 hemizygous males have been diagnosed. We used nine polymorphic DNA markers to study the localization of RS on the short arm of the X chromosome in 31 families comprising 88 affected persons. Two-point linkage results confirmed close linkage of the RS gene to the marker loci DXS43, DXS16, DXS207, and DXS41 and also revealed close linkage to the marker loci DXS197 and DXS9. Only one recombination was observed between DXS43 and RS in 59 informative meioses, giving a maximum lod score of 13.87 at the recombination fraction .02. No recombinations were observed between the RS locus and DXS9 and DXS197 (lods between 3 and 4), but at neither locus was the number of informative meioses sufficient to provide reliable estimates of recombination fractions. The most likely gene order on the basis of multilocus analysis was Xpter-DXS85-(DXS207,DXS43)-RS-DXS41-DXS 164-Xcen. Because multilocus linkage analysis indicated that the most probable location of RS is proximal to DXS207 and DXS43 and distal to DXS41, these three flanking markers are the closest and most informative markers currently available for carrier detection.\r"

  ".W": "The X-linked recessive type of retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) causes progressive night blindness, visual field constriction, and eventual blindness in affected males by the third or fourth decade of life. The biochemical basis of the disease is unknown, and prenatal diagnosis and definitive carrier diagnosis remain elusive. Heterogeneity in XLRP has been suggested by linkage studies of families affected with XLRP and by phenotypic differences observed in female carriers. Localization of XLRP near Xp11.3 has been suggested by close linkage to an RFLP at the locus DXS7 (Xp11.3) detected by probe L1.28. In other studies a locus for XLRP with metallic sheen has been linked to the ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) locus mapping to the Xp21 region. In this study, by linkage analysis using seven RFLP markers between Xp21 and Xcen, we examined four families with multiple affected individuals. Close linkage was found between XLRP and polymorphic sites OTC (theta = .06 with lod 5.69), DXS84 (theta = .05 with lod 4.08), and DXS206 (theta = .06 with lod 2.56), defined by probes OTC, 754, and XJ, respectively. The close linkage of OTC, 754, and XJ to XLRP localizes the XLRP locus to the Xp21 region. Data from recombinations in three of four families place the locus above L1.28 and below the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, consistent with an Xp21 localization. In one family, however, one affected male revealed a crossover between XLRP and all DNA markers, except for the more distal DXS28 (C7), while his brother is recombined for this marker (C7) and not other, more proximal markers. This suggests that in this family the XLRP mutation maps near DXS28 and above the DMD locus.\r"

The hybridization signals are then counted, and the dpm ratios between the two isotopes are determined. In this paper we show the application of this technique in sex determination, in the analysis of two human cell lines reported to have chromosome 21 monosomy, and, especially, in testing for Down syndrome.\r"

One might conclude from this observation that the absence of this haplotype--or the presence of a closely linked gene--is a causal risk factor for the disease. It is shown that Gm3;5,13,14 is a marker for Caucasian admixture, and it is most likely the presence of Caucasian alleles and the concomitant decrease of Indian alleles that lowers the risk for diabetes, rather than the direct action of the haplotype or of a closely linked locus. This study demonstrates both the potential confounding effect of admixture on the interpretation of disease association studies and the importance of considering genetic admixture (or excluding individuals with genetic admixture) in studies of genetic markers of disease. The relationship between this admixture marker and the prevalence of diabetes also suggests a strong genetic component in the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Pima and Papago Indians.\r"

Nineteen different haplotypes were identified among the 36 haplotypes studied in the black population, but only seven different ones were found among the 37 haplotypes in the San; five were common to both populations.

Important differences emerge in the comparison of Senegalese with Bantu of South Africa and with Bushmen, the only other Africans who, as far as we know, were studied for the same genetic markers. Though Senegalese mtDNAs display typical African features (presence and frequency of HpaI morph 3 and high incidence of AvaII morph 3), the distribution of MspI and AvaII patterns markedly differentiates Senegalese from the others. The phylogeny of mtDNA types in Africa well portrays how the three African groups are clearly distinguishable genetic entities. Bushmen lie at one end of the range of variability, Senegalese being at the other end but still fairly closely related to Bantu.

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence, physician recognition, and treatment of alcohol abuse among patients of 19 senior medical residents practicing in a hospital-based, primary care setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interviews of 242 outpatients were conducted, and alcohol abuse and dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III), were determined using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the patients studied had abused or were dependent on alcohol at some time in their lives and 5 percent reported abuse or dependence within the last year. Of the techniques studied, a short screening questionnaire (Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test [SMAST]) was the most accurate way of identifying patients who abused alcohol, and physician assessments were more accurate than laboratory tests. Although the physicians were aware of serious alcohol problems among 77 percent of their patients who met DSM-III criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence in the previous year, they identified only 36 percent of their patients with less serious problems or past alcohol abuse. They had only discussed alcohol abuse with 67 percent of the patients they identified as alcohol abusers. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a short screening questionnaire (SMAST) is an accurate means of identifying alcohol abuse. Despite the recognition of serious alcohol problems by the physicians, the problem is not addressed routinely even among patients that are recognized as alcoholic.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Because of past multiple exposures to contaminated coagulation factor concentrates, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among adult hemophilic men in the United States is reported to range from 75 to 90 percent. The risk of HIV transmission through a long-term monogamous heterosexual contact can be estimated by studying the spouses of hemophilic subjects since these couples generally do not abuse intravenous drugs, usually maintain stable monogamous relationships, and are usually free of other risk factors. Our purpose was to gather data on the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV infection in the context of long-term monogamous relations according to the duration of HIV antibody seropositivity and of HIV antigenemia in HIV-infected hemophilic men, and their sexual habits. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Infection with HIV was studied in 14 sexually active spouses of infected hemophilic men who had been HIV antibody reactive for a mean of 46 +/- 23 (SD) months. One half of the hemophilic men studied had overt HIV antigenemia for a mean duration of 27 +/- 23 (SD) months; six of the men studied fulfilled clinical criteria for the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). All 14 couples were sexually active in a strictly monogamous fashion, in marriages of 13.5 +/- 10.5 (SD) years with an average reported frequency of four sexual encounters per month (range: one to 12). Plasma samples of the hemophilic husbands were retrospectively analyzed for HIV and hepatitis B virus markers. Blood samples were obtained from female spouses on at least two occasions, six months apart. Comprehensive questionnaires regarding sexual habits and other risk factors were filled out by each couple; during this interview, the couple was counseled about safe sexual practices. None of the couples studied used condoms prior to January 1986. RESULTS: Antibodies to HIV developed in only one of the 14 wives. At the time when this seroconversion was detected, her husband, in whom AIDS developed, had been reactive for HIV antibody for 49 months, and showed positive findings for HIV antigen for 26 months. No additional risk factors were identified for this couple. The infected female spouse, however, has a 14-year history of multiple sclerosis, and had been treated with immunosuppressant intermittently. Despite a significantly reduced number of CD4 lymphocytes, she has remained clinically asymptomatic for 17 months since seroconversion. HIV antibodies did not develop in any of the 13 remaining wives, despite the frequent practice of oral sex by six couples and reports of occasional anal intercourse by another couple.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "INTRODUCTION: Gangrenous (necrotizing) cellulitis is a progressive bacterial infection of skin and soft tissue; the infection can spread into subcutaneous tissue with involvement of superficial and deep fascia (necrotizing fasciitis). We describe two pancytopenic patients with polymicrobial gram-negative bacteremia and fulminating gangrenous cellulitis. CASE REPORTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a localized hemorrhagic area of the face in one patient. The chronology of infection in these two patients is documented in a series of dramatic color photographs. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the infections progressed relentlessly and both patients died. COMMENTS: We discuss the dilemma of establishing the correct diagnosis prior to the appearance of the characteristic cutaneous manifestations of hemorrhagic necrosis and gangrene. Once the diagnosis is established, surgical excision is universally recommended. Unfortunately, bleeding diatheses in pancytopenic patients with co-existing coagulation deficiencies pose logistic obstacles in urgent, real-life situations. The timing and conditions for surgery need to be elucidated in these patients. An approach to this infection is proposed. The utility of frozen-section biopsy of the involved tissue and computed tomographic scans of the involved area remains to be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Surgically implanted central venous catheters are widely used in cancer patients in whom there is a need for prolonged venous access for chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and blood sampling. This study evaluated catheter infectious complications, including catheter-related sepsis, exit site infection, and tunnel infection. Specifically, an evaluation of the incidence, type, and response to treatment of indwelling catheter infections was performed, and conditions under which the catheter should be removed were delineated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the year of this study, 488 central venous catheters were implanted. Records were maintained on demographic variables, date of catheter implantation, surgeon, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and underlying diagnosis. Blood for both aerobic and anaerobic culture was collected from each patient. For patients in whom infection developed, clinical features, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and microbiologic data were noted, as were the clinical course and response to treatment. RESULTS: A total of 142 episodes of infectious complications were documented. There were 88 episodes of catheter-related sepsis, and 33 of 54 evaluable episodes (61 percent) were successfully treated with antibiotics. There were 34 episodes of exit site infection, and 20 of the 29 evaluable episodes (69 percent) were successfully treated with antibiotics and local care. Of the 20 tunnel infections, only five (25 percent) were successfully treated with antibiotics, and the other 15 required catheter removal for cure. Twelve of the 15 cases requiring catheter removal were caused by Pseudomonas species. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these results, compulsory removal of the catheter is not required in cases of catheter-related sepsis. Similarly, exit site infections can often be cured by means of antibiotics and local care. However, catheter removal is required to achieve cure in most tunnel infections, particularly if Pseudomonas species are cultured from the exit sites of patients with tunnel infection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To compare the usefulness of specimens recovered using a protected specimen brush and those recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia occurring in intubated patients undergoing ventilation, we performed both procedures in patients suspected of having pneumonia because of the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate and purulent tracheal secretions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients (16 men and five women) with an average age of 57 +/- 12 years were studied. They had been receiving mechanical ventilation for 8 +/- 6 days before inclusion in the trial. The clinical suspicion for nosocomial bacterial pneumonia was high in these patients. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in each patient. Bronchoscopy specimens were obtained by a protected specimen brush and by bronchoalveolar lavage, and were then processed for quantitative bacterial and fungal culture using standard methods. Total cell counts were performed on an aliquot of resuspended original lavage fluid. Differential cell counts were made on at least 500 cells. In addition, 300 cells were examined at high-power magnification and the percentage of cells containing intracellular microorganisms and the average number of extracellular organisms per oil-immersion field were determined. RESULTS: Quantitative culture of specimens recovered using the protected specimen brush were positive (more than 10(3) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) in five of five patients with subsequently confirmed pneumonia, and negative (less than 10(3) cfu/ml) in 13 of 13 patients without bacterial pneumonia, but results were not available until 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. Quantification of intracellular organisms in cells recovered by lavage was also useful in distinguishing patients with pneumonia (more than 25 percent of cells with intracellular organisms in five of five patients) from those without pneumonia (less than 15 percent of cells with intracellular organisms in all cases), and results were available immediately. In contrast, quantitative culture of lavage fluid and differential cell counts were of little value in identifying infected patients. CONCLUSION: The protected specimen brush and microscopic identification of intracellular organisms in cells recovered by lavage yield useful and complementary information, and together permit rapid and specific treatment of most patients with nosocomial pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Central nervous system disease and vasculitis are extraglandular manifestations of Sjogren's syndrome. In our experience, central nervous system disease develops in approximately 70 percent of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and biopsy documented peripheral vasculitis. In order to further investigate the pathogenesis of central nervous system disease and its relationship to peripheral vasculitis in Sjogren's syndrome, we examined sera of patients with Sjogren's syndrome with and without focal central nervous system involvement for evidence of terminal complement pathway activation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were classified as having active focal central nervous system involvement only when they had focal neurologic deficits on physical examination, plus at least one abnormal neurodiagnostic test result. Two thirds of these patients also had cognitive or psychiatric dysfunction. Patients were classified as having peripheral vasculitis if they had clinical and histopathologic documentation of vascular inflammation. Serum SC5b-9 was measured by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Total hemolytic complement assay, measurement of serum C3 and C4 by radial immunodiffusion, and determination of immune complexes were performed. RESULTS: Fluid-phase terminal complement complexes (SC5b-9) were detected in the sera of 25 of 30 (83 percent) patients with focal central nervous system involvement, but in only seven of 21 (33 percent) patients with Sjogren's syndrome without focal central nervous system disease (p = 0.00084 by Yates' chi-square analysis). Four of these seven patients without focal central nervous system disease, but who had serum SC5b-9, had psychiatric or cognitive dysfunction. SC5b-9 was also detected in sera from 14 of 15 (93 percent) patients with active biopsy-documented peripheral vasculitis in contrast to 18 of 36 (50 percent) patients without clinical evidence of peripheral vasculitis (p = 0.0094). Serum SC5b-9 was a more sensitive indicator of complement activation than circulating immune complex or complement assays. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that terminal complement activation may participate in the pathophysiology of both central nervous system and peripheral vasculitis in Sjogren's syndrome. Serum SC5b-9 appears to be a useful diagnostic indicator of vascular inflammation in Sjogren's syndrome and appears to identify those patients at risk for central nervous system complications.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Theophylline is metabolized by the hepatic microsomal oxidase system, as is ranitidine, although the latter has a much lower affinity for the system. The incidence of theophylline toxicity is rare when the two drugs are administered simultaneously. We observed the development of clinical and chemical toxicity in three elderly patients receiving oral theophylline therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after the administration of ranitidine therapy for peptic ulcer disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had been receiving theophylline for prolonged periods of time were studied. Two patients presented with complaints of epigastric pain, which was attributed to acid-peptic disease; the other patient presented with hematemesis, which was shown to be due to gastric and duodenal ulcers. Ranitidine was administered for treatment of acid-peptic disease. Theophylline clearance rates were determined before, during, and after ranitidine treatment. When symptoms of theophylline toxicity developed, the dose of theophylline was either stopped or reduced. Subsequently, patients were readministered their usual dose of theophylline. RESULTS: The effect of simultaneous administration of both drugs resulted in similar reductions in theophylline clearance rates. Serum theophylline levels returned to pretreatment values after cessation of ranitidine treatment. In one patient, rechallenge with ranitidine during steady-state theophylline treatment resulted in recurrence of clinical and chemical theophylline toxicity. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that treatment with ranitidine may cause clinically apparent interactions with theophylline since both drugs are metabolized by the same cytochrome P-450 isozymes.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: This study was performed to assess the ability of the average linewidths of the methyl and methylene resonances from the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of human plasma to distinguish reliably between a normal, apparently healthy population and untreated patients with cancer as was suggested by a recent report (Fossel et al, N Engl J Med 1986; 315: 1369-1376). In that report, the absence of overlap between the two populations suggested that the technique had great diagnostic potential. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from healthy hospital personnel and patients with biopsy proven cancer who had not yet undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy. NMR measurements were obtained on decanted plasma samples. In addition, to determine whether the distributions obtained were sensitive to experimental conditions, we varied a number of experimental parameters. These were storage temperature, observation temperature, NMR observation technique, and magnetic field inhomogeneity. RESULTS: In our hands, the distributions substantially overlapped, although the means of the average linewidths of the normal (35.0 +/- 5.3 Hz, range = 24 to 48 Hz) and patient (31.6 +/- 5.7 Hz, range 20 to 44 Hz) populations were significantly different, delta = 3.4 Hz, p = 0.023. The degree of overlap corresponded to 74 percent sensitivity and 59 percent specificity. The distributions were independent of the experimental conditions except for observation temperature. In this case, there was insufficient difference between our experimental conditions and those of Fossel et al (25 degrees C versus 22 degrees C) to explain the difference in results. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that wide variations exist among normal, apparently healthy persons and emphasize the need for carefully matched control subjects. We conclude that this measurement is, as of now, unsuitable as a method for identifying malignant disease.\r"

To determine whether the renal excretion of uric acid precursors, hypoxanthine and xanthine, is also abnormal in primary gout, the concentrations of these purines were measured in plasma and 24-hour urine samples in normal subjects, in patients with primary gout and uric acid underexcretion, and in patients with enzyme deficiencies that are known to result in over-production of uric acid. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three groups of subjects were studied: Group I consisted of 10 ambulatory healthy normal men; Group II consisted of 15 patients in whom primary gout was diagnosed; and Group III consisted of 10 patients with various enzyme defects known to produce an excessive synthesis of uric acid. In each subject, plasma and 24-hour urinary uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and creatinine concentrations were measured and the mean of three consecutive determinations was used. The fractional excretion of purine compounds was calculated from a formula. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, and hemoglobin were also measured in each subject. RESULTS: Plasma hypoxanthine and xanthine were increased in the two groups of patients compared with the control subjects. Urinary hypoxanthine and xanthine levels were reduced in gouty patients compared with control subjects, whereas levels were increased in patients with uric acid overproduction. A positive correlation was found between the renal clearances of uric acid, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the renal excretion of hypoxanthine and xanthine is severely impaired in most patients with primary gout.\r"

Thrombophlebitis is particularly troublesome in patients who require repeated administration of hematin, and may eventually lead to the placement of central venous lines or implantation of indwelling venous access ports. We undertook this study to determine whether only patients with porphyria experienced peripheral thrombophlebitis and disturbed hemostasis following administration of hematin, or if this was a general phenomenon that could also be observed in normal volunteers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Hematin was administered intravenously in the doses customarily used in therapy of acute porphyria crises (4 mg/kg body weight) to nine normal male volunteers, who were screened by history, physical examination, routine blood cell counts, urinalysis, biochemical screening profile, and coagulation tests. Hemostasis tests were performed in each subject, and hematin concentrations were determined. RESULTS: Within the first 24 hours, the activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged in all subjects (mean of 25 percent), the prothrombin time was increased in eight subjects (mean of 20 percent), and the thrombin time in five subjects rose (mean of 15 percent), whereas the concentration of circulating platelets decreased in three subjects (mean of 20 percent). In four subjects (45 percent), thrombophlebitis developed following hematin infusion. CONCLUSION: Although hematin is frequently effective in the treatment of acute porphyria crises, it is often associated with abnormalities in coagulation and these effects also occur in normal volunteers.\r"

Retinopathy in patients presenting with less than 20/20 vision, abnormal color vision, and positive fluorescein angiography may progress even if treatment with the medication is discontinued. The Amsler grid is an effective method of screening patients taking antimalarial agents for early relative paracentral scotomas.

These 4-aminoquinoline drugs cross the placenta and have been reported to cause fetal abnormalities, including loss of vision, ototoxicity, and cochleovestibular dysfunction. However, other reports suggest that 4-aminoquinoline drugs can be taken safely during pregnancy, even in dosages used to control systemic connective tissue diseases. We retrospectively studied eight patients who took antimalarial drugs continuously throughout pregnancy. There was a total of 14 pregnancies in women receiving these drugs; three occurred during periods of disease activity and all of these resulted in failure to complete pregnancy successfully. Of the remaining 11 pregnancies exposed to antimalarial drugs, one resulted in stillbirth; four resulted in spontaneous abortion; and six had normal full-term standard deliveries. None of the live births demonstrated any congenital abnormalities. Hence, it is possible for women to produce normal live babies despite taking large doses of these drugs. If patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are already taking antimalarial drugs when they become pregnant, it is believed that the risk of disease flare and loss of pregnancy from discontinuing therapy outweighs any risks to fetuses from continuing the medication.\r"

  ".W": "No recent study has been published on the efficacy of antimalarial drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, antimalarial drug therapy was reported in several early studies to control SLE more effectively than corticosteroids alone and to permit lower doses of steroids to be used. To confirm these findings, we conducted a retrospective study of 43 SLE patients who had been taking antimalarials but in whom such therapy had been discontinued after two to 13 years due to the development of macular changes. Each patient served as his own control by the matching of each year during which antimalarial drugs were taken with one year without antimalarial medication. There was a total of 76 matched years for the 43 patients. Overall, no significant correlation was shown between antimalarial drug therapy and the presence or absence of general symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss); skin, cardiac, pulmonary, or central nervous system manifestations, arthritis, or other symptoms or signs that were measured. Although antimalarials reduced the required dosage of corticosteroids significantly (p less than 0.05), the amount of reduction was not considered clinically meaningful. Treatment with antimalarial drugs significantly reduced the number of disease flare-ups (p less than 0.05). There were also significant differences between the years with and without chloroquine therapy 500 mg per day (the only regimen for which adequate data were available for analysis) in terms of general symptoms and skin manifestations (p less than 0.05). A prospective, double-blind study of large numbers of patients would be important to confirm the findings of this retrospective study--and the observations of many rheumatologists that antimalarials are helpful in the treatment of SLE.\r"

In view of the efficacy and relative safety of hydroxychloroquine in other autoimmune disorders, the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg per day for 12 months) in 10 patients with Sjogren's syndrome was evaluated. Changes in levels of total immunoglobulin, antibody against Sjogren's syndrome-associated antigen B, rheumatoid factor, and in vitro production of immunoglobulin in the serum were evaluated. For comparison, 10 patients matched according to age and sex, who did not receive hydroxychloroquine were studied. In the hydroxychloroquine-treated group, the following observations were made: (1) significantly decreased total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA levels with little change in IgM levels; (2) significant decrease in IgA-rheumatoid factor with a smaller decrease in IgM-rheumatoid factor; (3) decreased IgG anti-Sjogren's syndrome-associated antigen B autoantibody; and (4) decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased hemoglobin level. Further, a specific idiotype present on their rheumatoid factor (defined by monoclonal antibody 17-109) was significantly decreased, with disappearance of detectable circulating paraprotein in two hydroxychloroquine-treated patients. Finally, rheumatoid factor production in vitro by lymphocytes from hydroxychloroquine-treated patients using a T cell-dependent mitogen was significantly decreased. These results suggest that hydroxychloroquine modulates lymphoproliferation in patients with Sjogren's syndrome and may prevent progression to extraglandular sites of neoplastic transformation.\r"

In addition to the routine tests done as part of a multicenter clinical trial, our patients had serial red cell mass measurements, quantitation of bone marrow stem cells, and marrow cytogenetic analysis. During the first eight weeks (acute phase), an equal number of patients was randomized to placebo or one of three doses of r-HuEPO (50, 100 or 150 unit/kg intravenously three times weekly). All three patients receiving 150 unit/kg responded by increasing their packed cell volume (PCV) to the normal range within eight weeks. There were lesser responses in PCV at the two lower doses of r-HuEPO and no response in the placebo group. The 51Cr red cell mass also increased significantly in a dose-related manner in patients receiving r-HuEPO but did not change in the placebo group. Marrow studies revealed increases in erythroid, megakaryocyte, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells in those patients on r-HuEPO, but no mutagenic effects were seen. Subsequently, ten patients received open label r-HuEPO. During this maintenance phase, all ten achieved or maintained a normal PCV. Several adverse events occurred, but none were definitely linked to r-HuEPO. Recombinant human erythropoietin is an effective and potent treatment of anemia caused by renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Heme oxygenase (HO) is the rate-limiting enzyme for heme degradation, and elevated levels of HO may be associated with a variety of pathologic disturbances. A limited number of HO inhibitors such as the metalloporphyrins have been proposed as possible chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. We undertook the study of various natural newly synthesized heme analogues as possible inhibitors of HO in human adult and fetal liver microsomes. We investigated two compounds with substitutions at the 2 and 4 position of the porphyrin ring, iron deuteroporphyrin 2,4 disulfonic (1a) and iron deuteroporphyrin 2,4 bis glycol (1b), and two compounds with substitutions of aromatic groups on the methene bridges of the porphyrin molecule, meso-tetra-4-carboxyphenyl-porphine (2a) and meso-tetra-4-sulfonatophenyl-porphine (2b). When these heme analogues were incubated in the reaction media in the presence of heme, two of the analogues (1a) and (1b) inhibited the conversion of heme to bilirubin. This inhibition was 97% and 65% respectively for (1a) and (1b) when both were present in 30 microM concentrations. Both of these compounds exhibited competitive type inhibition. The kI for the more potent inhibitor, (1b), was determined to be 0.30 microM. Porphyrins with aromatic substitutions at the methene bridges (2a, 2b) did not inhibit the conversion of heme to bilirubin, even at relatively high concentrations. Furthermore, the specific activity of HO was significantly greater (5X) in fetal microsomes as contrasted with adult microsomes as contrasted with adult microsomes. Even though fetal microsomes had greater HO activity, 5 microM of compound (1b) caused a similar degree of inhibition in both adult and fetal preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Severe hypertension may be a difficult management issue, and it often requires therapy with multiple drugs at frequent dosing intervals. We report on the antihypertensive effects of the alpha-beta adrenergic blocking agent, labetalol, in combination with enalapril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, administered to 14 patients with severe hypertension (nine of whom had nephrosclerosis or renal artery stenosis) on other antihypertensive drug therapies. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), hematologic and blood chemistry values, and adverse side effects were monitored at 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks of therapy. Rapid titration of the drugs was performed in the hospital in 10 patients; four were managed closely as outpatients. Following one month of combination therapy blood pressure decreased from 212 +/- 31/120 +/- 16 mm Hg at baseline to 155 +/- 19/86 +/- 12 mm Hg, and heart rate declined from 86 +/- 18 bpm to 70 +/- 16 bpm. Ten of the 14 patients (71%) maintained good BP control (BP less than 140/90 mm Hg) with no additional treatment. Serum potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and hematologic parameters did not significantly change in 13 of 14 patients. Three patients developed symptomatic postural hypotension; in one patient this side effect resulted in discontinuation from the study. These data suggest that combination therapy with labetalol and enalapril is effective in lowering BP in patients with severe essential or renovascular hypertension. An additional advantage of this regimen is the twice-daily dosing interval, which may promote better long-term compliance.\r"

The elementary bodies, at a multiplicity of infection of 600:1, were allowed to adsorb to the cell monolayers for 1 hour at 35 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. The monolayers were disaggregated by trypsinization and the individual cells were processed in the fluorescent activated cell sorter for chlamydial attachment. This method of analysis revealed attachment of C. trachomatis to approximately 50% of human endometrial gland epithelial cells. Addition of estrogen (10(-10) mol/L) to the culture medium enhanced chlamydial attachment to human endometrial gland epithelial cells to approximately 80% (p less than or equal to 0.005), and progesterone in combination with estrogen reduced chlamydial attachment in a dose-dependent fashion: 1 ng/ml progesterone, approximately 50%; 5 ng/ml, about 30%; 10 ng/ml, about 18%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.025).\r"

This article develops the arguments that informing infected women of their serologic status is of critical importance and that in clinical practice identification of women with sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus can only be accomplished with routine testing (with consent, confidentiality, and counseling).\r"

Three hundred patients had an unknown uterine scar, 88 patients had a documented low cervical transverse incision, and five patients had a prior low vertical incision. The rate of vaginal delivery and maternal and fetal morbidity was no different in those patients with an unknown prior uterine incision compared with those having a known prior low cervical transverse incision. In 66 of the patients with a documented low cervical transverse incision, the original operative record was reviewed in regard to single-layer closure of the uterine incision versus double-layer closure or imbricating technique. No patient with a double-layer uterine closure had a subsequent dehiscence, whereas three patients with a prior single-layer closure exhibited scar separation. These data suggest that neither an unknown scar nor a single-layer uterine closure places the mother or fetus at greater risk.\r"

Strict objective criteria were used to determine the adequacy of Papanicolaou smears on the basis of the number of cells present. The two methods were equally effective in collecting ectocervical smears. However, 96% of endocervical smears obtained with the nylon brush contained greater than 50 cells, compared with 58% of swab and spatula smears. Only 1.4% of brush samples contained no endocervical cells, versus 19% of swab and spatula smears. The presence of endocervical cells confirms adequate sampling of the transitional zone. Use of the cytologic Papanicolaou brush may result in fewer false negative and inadequate Papanicolaou smears.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of smoking on the treatment response in serum estrogens, serum lipids and lipoproteins, and bone mineral content in 110 postmenopausal women treated for 2 years with either percutaneous or orally administered combined hormones or placebo and followed up by examinations every 3 months. Serum estradiol and estrone levels during oral hormone administration were lower in smokers than in nonsmokers, whereas no differences related to smoking habits were observed during percutaneous hormone administration. Serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced in both smokers and nonsmokers receiving hormones, but the response in smokers was only half that observed in nonsmokers (not significant). When the impact of the route of hormone administration was examined in relation to smoking habits, the response in serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in smokers receiving oral hormones was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that observed in nonsmokers. No differences in serum lipids or lipoproteins were observed between smokers and nonsmokers receiving percutaneous hormones. The response in bone mineral content in smokers and nonsmokers receiving percutaneous hormones and placebo was not significantly different, although the overall response differed significantly in the two groups (p less than 0.001). In contrast, the response in smokers receiving oral hormones was significantly lower than that observed in the corresponding nonsmokers (p less than 0.01). We conclude that smoking greatly affects the response on circulating levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women treated with orally administered hormone replacement therapy and that the subsequent treatment response on serum lipids and lipoproteins and on bone mineral content is reduced accordingly. The study suggests that alternative routes of administration should be considered when postmenopausal estrogen therapy is instituted in women who smoke.\r"

In the presence of fetal tachycardia (basal fetal heart rate greater than 160 beats/min), more than 50% of fetal heart rate accelerations after stimulus were less than 15 beats/min amplitude. There was also a significant maturational process in the immediate fetal heart rate response to vibratory acoustic stimulation that occurred between 26 to 28 and 30 to 32 weeks characterized by a prolonged increase in basal fetal heart rate and an increase in the maximum amplitude of the first acceleration after stimulation.\r"

Iodine 131-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of a monoclonal antibody, OC 125, with specificity for ovarian carcinoma, were used to study the distribution and pharmacokinetics of this antibody in patients with gynecologic tumors. The radiolabeled antibody was injected intravenously or intraperitoneally into 10 patients suspected of having ovarian cancer. Blood and urine samples were used for pharmacokinetic studies, and biopsy specimens were examined for the uptake of antibody. The serum half-life of the labeled antibody was 30 hours after intravenous administration, with 20% of the injected dose per liter detected at 24 hours. After intraperitoneal injection, the appearance of antibody in serum was slow, with a maximum level of 1.4% of the injected dose per liter at 24 hours. Urinary excretion of the radiolabeled antibody was similar for intravenous and intraperitoneal administration, with approximately 50% of the injected dose excreted after 48 hours. Intraperitoneal administration of the radiolabeled antibody resulted in a higher uptake of antibody in the tumor and a lower uptake of antibody in normal tissues. On the basis of this limited study, intraperitoneal administration of radiolabeled antibody is preferred over intravenous administration for radioimmunotherapy of ovarian cancer.\r"

We hypothesized that antineoplastic agents might show synergistic cytotoxicity when combined with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Twenty-four malignant ovarian tumors were removed and used in tests to determine the cytotoxicities of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide alone, each of six antineoplastic agents alone, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide plus each antineoplastic agent. Cytotoxicity results for 10% dimethyl sulfoxide alone and each antineoplastic agent alone were used to evaluate each combination of dimethyl sulfoxide and an antineoplastic agent for synergy. There were 14 synergistic responses that were statistically significant at the p less than 0.01 confidence level between 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and an antineoplastic agent against the ovarian tumors. Seven of these responses were significant at the p less than 0.0003 level. This is strong evidence that true synergistic cytotoxicity occurs when an antineoplastic agent is combined with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. We conclude that intraperitoneal delivery of antineoplastic agents in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide may be useful in the treatment of certain ovarian cancers.\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies concerning effects of varying degrees of normal glucose metabolism on pregnancy have reported an increase in the incidence of a variety of pregnancy complications in women with normal oral glucose tolerance test results as the glucose concentration after a standardized meal rose. However, these investigations have neglected to include a control group of women with gestational diabetes for comparison. We theorized that if the adverse outcomes noted were indeed a reflection of glucose concentration, women with gestational diabetes should have an even higher incidence of these complications. Mother and infant charts of 312 consecutive women undergoing an oral glucose tolerance test were reviewed. A glucose challenge test preceded the oral glucose tolerance test in 310. The glucose challenge test value was less than 140 mg/dl in 64 and greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl in 246. There were 63 abnormal oral glucose tolerance test results (2.7% of the population studied). Among all patients, the relationship between glucose challenge test and oral glucose tolerance test values followed a gradient with a progressive rise in mean oral glucose tolerance test values when the glucose challenge test result was greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl. However, the incidence of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test result did not rise significantly until the glucose challenge test result exceeded 180 mg/dl. A wide variety of outcome parameters were studied; none were related to the glucose challenge test value. Similar analysis of the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test value revealed an increase in the incidence of nonelective operative deliveries and a decrease in the percentage of infants discharged home with their mother where values were greater than 180 mg/dl. However, when women with gestational diabetes were excluded from analysis, neither the glucose challenge test nor the 2-hour glucose tolerance test measurements were related to adverse outcome. When analysis was limited to women with gestational diabetes, there was no clinically significant relationship between either glucose challenge test or 2-hour glucose tolerance test and the outcome parameters. Finally, when analysis was repeated according to diagnosis, women with gestational diabetes had a significantly higher risk of having nonelective operative delivery, premature delivery, growth-retarded neonate, 1-minute Apgar score less than 7, and neonatal hypoglycemia than women with normal oral glucose tolerance test results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Although this incidence may have been affected by the temporal relationship of the scan to the seizure, it was greatly impacted by technical resolution obtained with succeeding improved equipment. In the last 3 years of the study more than a third of these scans showed some abnormality, and in 1986, using \"fourth-generation\" equipment, half were abnormal. These areas of radiographic hypodensity correspond to those with petechial hemorrhages and local edema that have been described at autopsy in women who died after eclamptic episodes. All women recovered fully despite ominous findings in some. We conclude that the clinical utility of tomography in women with otherwise \"uncomplicated eclampsia\" is limited because these findings seldom alter management.\r"

Nine patients underwent 30 percutaneous fetal blood sampling procedures to determine fetal blood type or hematocrit, without complication. Thirteen patients underwent 45 intrauterine fetal transfusions via the umbilical vessels and 16 intraperitoneal fetal transfusions. The overall survival rate in this series was 85.7%. Survival among fetuses that were hydropic at initial evaluation was 83.3%. The procedure-related perinatal mortality rate for intravascular intrauterine transfusions was 2.2%. Knowledge of fetal blood type and hematocrit allowed treatment individualized to the specific needs of each patient. In particular, the ability to transfuse blood directly into the vascular system of the hydropic fetus proved to be lifesaving in those patients.\r"

In 52.2% of ampullary pregnancies, the gestations were found intraluminally, and in most of these cases (85.1%), the muscularis was preserved. In isthmic pregnancies, the gestations were usually found extraluminally or both intraluminally and extraluminally. The disruption of the tubal wall was more extensive in isthmic pregnancy. This study suggests that in isthmic pregnancy, the trophoblast penetrates the tubal wall relatively early. It appears that linear salpingostomy could be done for ampullary pregnancy without jeopardizing luminal integrity. Its use for isthmic pregnancy is still unclear.\r"

Randomized to undergo chorionic villus sampling or genetic amniocentesis as part of a trial examining the safety and accuracy of these procedures, the women were studied at four time periods: time 1, before prenatal testing (9 to 12 weeks' gestation); time 2, after the chorionic villus sampling results were received (13 weeks); time 3, before the genetic amniocentesis results were known (18 weeks), and time 4, after all results were known (22 weeks). Although they were still at risk for miscarriage, members of the chorionic villus sampling group showed a sharp drop in anxiety levels immediately after receiving their results. The genetic amniocentesis group remained anxious until the last test time. In summary, prenatal testing by means of chorionic villus sampling resulted in earlier and sustained anxiety reduction.\r"

  ".U": "89023391\r", 
  ".W": "Activity of peritoneal plasminogen activator and its regulation by dextran and other macromolecules that clinically suppress postoperative adhesions was studied. Plasminogen activator activity was assayed by a two-stage globinolytic assay that monitors formation of plasmin, as well as by cleavage of a chromogenic peptide substrate (S-2444) in the presence of aprotinin (Trasylol). Plasminogen activator activity was located on the outer surface of human peritoneum. Incubation of peritoneal tissue with buffer in vitro (conditioning) prompted release of plasminogen activator into the conditioning medium. The released plasminogen activator formed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis at an apparent molecular weight of 174,000 and was markedly suppressed by antiserum raised against human melanoma tissue-type plasminogen activator. Nonspecific proteolytic activity did not accumulate in the medium during conditioning. The presence of dextran 80 during conditioning of peritoneum reversibly suppressed tissue-bound plasminogen activator activity and reduced plasminogen activator activity in the spent medium. A similar inhibition of peritoneal plasminogen activator was induced by dextran 500, methyl cellulose, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Dextran, when added to the medium after conditioning, had no direct inhibitory effect on plasminogen activator activity. Dextran did not induce peritoneal production of inhibitor(s) of trypsin, chymotrypsin, or urokinase. On the basis of these findings, two possible mechanisms for the effect of viscous polymers in the reduction of adhesion formation are proposed. These mechanisms consider the importance of peritoneal tissue-type plasminogen activator for removal of fibrin clots and suggest that polymer coating either prevents the shedding of plasminogen activator into the abdominal cavity or reduces the access of fibrin clots to the serosal surfaces.\r"

To study the hormonal regulation of this altered pressor response to angiotensin II during pregnancy, we administered estradiol, progesterone, and human chorionic gonadotropin to nonpregnant rats. In ovariectomized rats no effect of estradiol on the pressor response to angiotensin II was found, but injections of progesterone with or without estradiol pretreatment significantly reduced the pressor response to angiotensin II. In intact rats human chorionic gonadotropin induced elevation of endogenous progesterone levels, followed by a significant decrease in the pressor response to angiotensin II. Injection of estradiol after human chorionic gonadotropin pretreatment produced a significant elevation in the pressor response to angiotensin II. These findings indicate that the decrease in angiotensin pressor response in pregnant rats is mediated mainly by progesterone rather than by estrogen.\r"

No intraoperative complications were encountered. Intraocular pressure, measured in 12 animals, decreased an average of 12 mm Hg in the treated eye relative to the fellow eye on the first postoperative day. The drop in intraocular pressure was associated with formation of a functioning filtration bleb. Intraocular pressure returned to preoperative levels in ten of 12 (83%) of the animals by the fourth postoperative day, and there was an associated flattening of the filtration bleb. Histologic and radioautographic analysis indicated that the effect of the laser was focal. Tissue damage and cellular proliferative response were limited to within approximately 200 micron of the wound margin.\r"

A wide spectrum of pathologic changes were observed, ranging from near normal retina showing only photoreceptor outer segment disease (distortion and kinking) to grossly pathologic regions where photoreceptor cell bodies were sparse and their outer segments absent. The retinal pigment epithelium in minimally affected regions of the retina showed an increased proportion of the melanin complement of the cell within complex granules. In severe disease, many cells showed only giant complex granules with no free melanin. Retinal pigment epithelial cell migration and relocation around blood vessels was also noted in severe disease.\r"

Corneas perfused with 100-U/ml thrombin solutions showed a significant attenuation in their deswelling rate but no ultrastructural alterations. One available thrombin preparation when diluted to 100 U/ml had a glycine concentration associated with previous retinal electroretinography changes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of one manufacturer's thrombin solution showed multiple high and low molecular weight constituents. Analysis of particulate contamination showed one 100-U/ml thrombin preparation to have a large quantity of particulates. Although thrombin may be useful when applied topically as an aid in surgical hemostasis, its use intraocularly presents substantial concern regarding the preparation's purity, additives, contaminants, and adverse effects on ocular tissues.\r"

Infants delivered by cesarean section within three hours of membrane rupture may not need prophylactic eyedrops because of the type and scarcity of conjunctival bacteria.\r"

In the 21 patients with uveitis, the disease exhibited either a monophasic course (eight patients) with favorable visual outcome or a relapsing course (13 patients) with severe visual loss in five eyes. Thirty-three patients showed chronic ophthalmic changes at the follow-up examination, including conjunctival granulomas (13 patients), lacrimal gland involvement (22 patients), uveitis (four patients), and involvement of lacrimal passages (three patients). In 15 of these 33 patients, the general physical examination and the chest x-ray showed no evidence of systemic sarcoidosis. However, the serum angiotensin converting enzyme level was increased in a significantly greater proportion of these 15 patients than in the patients assessed as totally recovered from sarcoidosis.\r"

The authors have applied and extended (using formic acid pretreatment of histologic sections) an immunocytochemical technique that used antibody to a synthetic 28-amino acid peptide representing a segment of the AD amyloid precursor, to study CAA and related parenchymal amyloid deposits in brain tissues originally derived from: 1) patients with CAA with or without typical clinicopathologic features of AD, cerebral hemorrhage, and infarcts; 2) a young boy with angiocentric brain amyloid; 3) patients with familial (Icelandic, Dutch) forms of cerebral hemorrhage caused by CAA; and 4) Japanese patients with nonfamilial CAA-related brain hemorrhage, sometimes associated with histopathology characteristic of AD. Formic acid pretreatment of sections resulted in markedly enhanced staining of senile plaque core and microvascular, especially capillary, amyloid, and some apparent staining of the neuritic component of senile plaques. Perivascular halos of immunoreactive material were observed frequently. Neurofibrillary tangles were not immunolabeled, nor were blood vessels or any parenchymal components within cerebral white matter. CAA in Japanese patients with nonfamilial encephalic hemorrhages appeared immunocytochemically identical to AD-related CAA. Arterioles in brains that had severe CAA frequently showed significant stenosis of their lumina by nonamyloid hyaline or cellular material.\r"

The saline control animals had increased numbers and percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the BALF as well as increased levels of TxB2 and PGF2-alpha compared with unexposed animals. Exposure to CDE further increased the number and percentage of PMN and the level of PGF2-alpha but had no effect on TxA2 levels when compared with control animals. Tannin exposure increased PGF2-alpha levels to the same extent as CDE exposure. PMN also increased but to a lesser extent than with CDE. These results indicate that the inflammatory response to CDE is only partially due to the tannin present in CDE.\r"

Lipid analysis of 76 surgical specimens containing evidence of pathologic calcification (35 hydroxyapatite, 35 calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, and 6 containing other crystalline materials) had mean complexed acidic phospholipid contents of 8.7, 1, and 0.012, (microgram/mg demineralized dry weight) respectively. Tissues that contained larger, more perfect hydroxyapatite crystals based on x-ray diffraction analyses, had a higher complexed acidic phospholipid content (7.5 +/- 4 micrograms/mg demineralized dry weight, N = 16) than tissues with poorly crystallized hydroxyapatite (3.9 +/- 2 micrograms/mg, N = 11). Histologically, tissues containing larger crystals were characterized by cell or tissue necrosis. Poorly crystalline deposits were found in tissues showing little or no evidence of cell necrosis or tissue degeneration.\r"

Studies in experimental animals have shown that circulating DNA is rapidly removed by the liver and broken down to oligonucleotides. The authors have used a perfused liver system in the mouse to study hepatic binding of single-stranded DNA. DNA binding to the liver was rapid and efficient, and did not require serum factors. Binding was saturable and temperature independent, suggesting a receptor-mediated process. Electron microscope autoradiography demonstrated DNA binding to sinusoidal lining cells, primarily Kupffer cells. In vitro studies with isolated cells confirmed that DNA bound to a trypsin-sensitive receptor on the adherent subset of hepatic nonparenchymal cells. The integrity of the perfused liver was confirmed by the demonstration of appropriate uptake and breakdown of asialoorosomucoid. Despite rapid binding of DNA, however, the perfused liver did not digest DNA or release DNA breakdown products. Infusion of DNAse at intervals after DNA perfusion demonstrated that significant amounts of DNA remained bound to the cell surface, and that serum nucleases were able to cleave this surface bound DNA. It is concluded that DNA binding to the liver is mediated by a receptor on Kupffer cells, but that DNA breakdown may occur at the cell surface or in circulation and may not require cell interiorization.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1976 there has been a leveling off or slowdown in the rate of decline in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. The age-adjusted absolute annual rate of decline in CHD mortality rates during 1968-75 (delta rate/100,000 population/year) was virtually identical for White males (-7.54), Black males (-7.85), and Black females (-7.20), and somewhat lower for White females (-4.25). During 1976-85, however, the secular trends diverged considerably. Age-adjusted rates continued to decline at the same annual rate for White males, while the decline was approximately half as steep for the other three race-sex groups. During 1976-85 there was also a leveling off in the average annual per cent change in age-adjusted CHD mortality for Black males and females and White females when compared to 1968-75, while there was no change for White males. As a result, more than 40,000 White and Black females and Black males died of CHD in 1985 than would have died if CHD rates would have continued to decline at the 1968-75 trends. All comparisons were based on a reclassification of cause-of-death codes to maximize comparability between the 8th and 9th Revisions of the International Classification of Disease. These results suggest that the factors which have led to the continued decline in coronary heart disease may not have influenced all the demographic groups in this country equally over the last decade.\r"

Data were collected for 247 children 60 months of age and under between July 1984 and February 1985 in 10 villages that had an improved water supply at least one year prior to investigation. Children whose families relied exclusively on the new water supply for their drinking and cooking needs grew 0.438 cm and 235 g more in six months than children whose families supplemented the new water supply with the use of contaminated traditional water for drinking and cooking. The difference in growth was greater among children over 12 months of age at the start of the evaluation than among infants. This may be explained partly by lower rates for Giardia lamblia, the most commonly identified pathogen in stools in older children. Among infants, similar rates of Campylobacter, the most commonly isolated pathogen among infants, may have prevented larger differences. Results suggest that improved drinking water supplies can benefit preschool children's health after infancy, but only if they are functioning and utilized exclusively for drinking and cooking purposes.\r"

Comparing the fatality risk of unrestrained occupants matched in sex and age (within three years) revealed effects attributable to seating position, and not to occupant characteristics correlated with use of different seats. Fatality risk to drivers was the same as fatality risk to right front passengers to within 1 per cent; this was so for crashes in all directions and for frontal crashes. Fatality risk in rear seats was (26 +/- 2) per cent lower than in front seats, and lower in center compared to outboard seats by (22 +/- 4) per cent for front seats and (15 +/- 4) per cent for rear seats. The center rear seat was associated with the lowest fatality risk.\r"

Sunlight exposure was inferred from interview data on residency and time spent in the sun, combined with solar radiation data from the National Climatic Data Center. Sunlight exposure was very slightly related to all types of opacities combined. Although the numbers of cases with each type of opacity was small, the risk of cataracts was slightly increased in medium and high exposure categories for persons having cortical or posterior subcapsular opacities only, but not nuclear sclerotic changes. Persons with dark brown or hazel eyes are at increased risk. An unexpected finding was that persons who reported using tranquilizers for six months were at increased risk.\r"

The principal factor that led to the adoption of ORT is its apparent low cost per diarrheal death averted in children when compared with WS&S. However, WS&S provides many more benefits that are essential to sustaining the lives saved by ORT and vital to maintaining and enhancing the lives of adults and children. Among many other benefits WS&S prevents spread of the causes of diarrhea, controls many other water- and sanitation-related diseases, releases women from the heavy and time-consuming burden of carrying water from distant sources, and improves the quality of life in the community. Cost comparisons between WS&S and ORT are misleading. WS&S is a long-term investment in preventive health while ORT is a response to an immediate life-threatening situation. WS&S interventions eliminate unsanitary conditions leading to illness and death while ORT has no effect on the causes of diarrheal morbidity. The costs of WS&S are not high: $5 to $10 per capita annually. Without WS&S and hygiene education ORT programs are not likely to effect long-term improvement in child health status. ORT and WS&S programs are complementary; one should not displace the other.\r"

In contrast, 50 micrograms human TNF did not cause fetal death or abortion in uninfected 16 day pregnant mice. Endogenous TNF, which was not detectable in plasma of low parasitemia animals, pregnant or not, was present (1.6 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) in samples from malarial pregnant mice when, on day 17, parasitemia was high and the first signs of impending abortion were evident. No TNF was detectable in the plasma of uninfected mice at day 17 of pregnancy. A small dose of TNF also caused fetal death in 16 day pregnant mice that had received an intravenous injection of Coxiella burneti extract 9-10 days earlier. Thus, TNF-induced abortion may occur in a range of infections in which systemic macrophage activation occurs and a trigger for TNF release is present.\r"

It presents direct experimental evidence from in vivo studies that species of Leishmania differ in their capacity to multiply in cutaneous and visceral sites which results in differences in the pattern and rate of development of leishmaniasis. It was found that Leishmania mexicana amazonensis begins to multiply in the cutaneous site of inoculation within 7 days. Parasites, detected in the liver and spleen at 4 weeks, increased 100-fold during the next 4 months. However, the slow multiplication of L. mexicana amazonensis in the liver and spleen was more apparent than real. Parasites implanted in those organs of athymic nude mice by an intravenous injection were rapidly eliminated with a half-time of 16 hr. Thus, the parasites found in small numbers in the liver during the development of disseminated cutaneous disease in mice are most likely those which have been recently removed from the blood. Those few parasites that are not removed from the blood can establish metastatic foci in distant cutaneous sites, and replicate progressively once there.\r"

In Bajo Calima, Buenaventura, Lu. trapidoi represented over 94% of the anthropophilic sandflies. Continuous sampling from 1800 to 0600 hours in Inguapi del Guadual demonstrated that Lu. trapidoi bites mainly at dusk and dawn whereas Lu. gomezi remains active throughout the night. In Inguapi del Guadual, promastigotes were found in 0.1% (2/2, 305) of Lu. trapidoi, 0.2% (3/140) of Lu. gomezi, and 0.2% (1/424) of Lu. panamensis samples collected. In Bajo Calima, 1.9% (8/429) of Lu. trapidoi were found to be infected. Leishmania braziliensis panamensis, the most common Leishmania subspecies in the human population of this endemic focus, was isolated from 1 Lu. trapidoi from Inguapi del Guadual. Parasitological and entomological findings suggest that Lu. trapidoi could be the main vector of Leishmania in these areas, although Lu. gomezi and Lu. panamensis were also predominant.\r"

  ".W": "Six Leishmania isolates from 3 indigenous Kenyans (2 isolates from one patient) and 2 Canadian visitors in Kenya were characterized by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The isolates were compared among themselves and with reference strains of Leishmania donovani, L. aethiopica, L. major, L. tropica, and L. arabica using 9 enzymes: malate dehydrogenase (MDH), malic enzyme (ME), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), adenylate kinase (AK), mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and phosphoglucomutase (PGM). Enzyme migration patterns of isolates from the 3 indigenous Kenyans were indistinguishable from those of 2 L. tropica reference strains. The isolates from the 2 Canadians yielded migration patterns of 7 enzymes that were indistinguishable from those of 2 L. tropica reference strains. However, migration patterns of 2 enzymes, PGM and ME, differed from all migration patterns of the 10 reference strains. Balb/c mice were inoculated with stationary phase promastigotes cultured from 3 stabilates from the lesions of 2 of the Kenyan patients. The mice developed no gross pathological lesions in 6 months time. All of the study patients developed cutaneous leishmaniasis while living in or visiting districts in Central and Rift Valley Provinces, Kenya. This is the first report of human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica indigenous to Africa south of the Sahara.\r"

  ".W": "Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites were centrifuged into mucus gels harvested from in vivo loops of rat cecum and proximal colon. Frank ameba movement was not detected in the colonic mucus, but attenuated motility was measured in the cecal mucus. The harvested rat cecal mucus had significantly lower apparent viscosity and neutral glycoprotein concentration values than the colonic mucus. A shape factor method was developed to assess the motility of amebae in mucus gels and intact mucus blankets. Shape factor data obtained from harvested mucus gel and intact mucus blanket experiments indicated that such mucus severely attenuated trophozoite movement with the attenuation being greater with colonic than with cecal mucus. Entamoeba trophozoites are known to be able to generate a pseudopod force of 3.3 x 10(-6) Newtons. Latex microspheres of the size range of Entamoeba trophozoites were forced through cecal and colonic mucus gels under gravity. Colonic mucus gels could withstand a force of 3.3 x 10(-6) Newtons while cecal mucus could not, suggesting that the ameba movement that was observed in cecal mucus involved mechanical penetration of the mucus by the ameba pseudopodia and did not require prior gel dissolution by Entamoeba enzymes.\r"

The reconstruction ideally must provide airway protection against aspiration, allow for phonation, and provide a durable mucosal surface. It also must be accomplished in one stage. Nine Labrador dogs underwent successful reconstruction of the hemilarynx using an axial island cheek flap based on the facial artery and vein. Adequate laryngeal function was demonstrated by maintenance of body weight, normal barium swallows, return of strong bark, and no evidence of aspiration pneumonia. Pathologic review confirmed a viable mucosal surface and incorporation of the Marlex and stainless steel wire mesh in a fibrous reaction. We have concluded that this method of reconstruction provides a result superior to currently used techniques.\r"

The medical records of 44 patients treated at our institution were reviewed. The cumulative 5-year survival rate after pulmonary resection was 43 percent. The optimal interval between diagnosis of the primary tumor and the development of pulmonary metastases was 13 to 24 months (p less than 0.005). The most favorable primary site was the larynx. No significant prognostic effect was noted for single versus multiple metastases or T-stage of the primary tumor. The presence of intervening locoregional recurrence prior to pulmonary diagnosis likewise had no significant effect on the survival rate. The initial presence of nodal metastases and primary tumor in the oral cavity had a poor outcome. The worst prognostic indicator was the presence of mediastinal disease (p less than 0.001). We have concluded that aggressive surgical treatment for isolated pulmonary metastases from the upper aerodigestive tract in the absence of mediastinal involvement is therapeutically beneficial. Selection criteria for resection should include site and stage of primary disease, locoregional control, interval from primary to pulmonary diagnosis, extent of pulmonary disease and mediastinal involvement, and the general medical condition of the patient.\r"

This reconstructive method, which uses only autogenous tissue, may offer a significant advantage in cases where more than a hemimaxillectomy is required, for compound defects resulting from the sacrifice of facial structures along with the maxillectomy, and in situations where the resection involves cranial base structures with a resultant need to separate the cranial contents from the oral and nasal cavities. Finally, it provides an alternative to prosthetic rehabilitation for the elderly patient with decreased or absent vision.\r"

In this retrospective review, we examined the role of radiotherapy and musculocutaneous flaps in the development and management of fistulas and found several significant factors associated with these fistulas. In patients with this complication, there is a significant decrease in postoperative hemoglobin and albumin levels and absolute lymphocyte counts. In addition, there is a significant reduction in lymphocyte counts in the irradiated patient. Musculocutaneous flaps play an invaluable role in the management of fistulas. In the irradiated patient, the healing of fistulas is a long and difficult process; the presence of a musculocutaneous flap is the only significant factor in the ability of the fistulas to heal spontaneously. If the fistulas are to close spontaneously, they will do so within 4 to 6 weeks. Fistulas that develop in the absence of a previously placed musculocutaneous flap are more severe than if a vascularized flap were present initially. Successful management of such fistulas is enhanced by use of vascularized extracervical tissue.\r"

At contact behind the implant, the dose was reduced considerably: 14 percent for Vitallium and 13 percent for stainless steel.

Partial laryngectomy was performed in 25 patients who had recurrent cancer after previous definitive radiotherapy and in 5 patients who had previously undergone cordectomy. There was no operative mortality and postoperative morbidity was low. Local recurrence developed in 32 patients (17 percent); cervical metastasis developed in 8 patients. The determinate survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 92 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed soft-tissue margins and tumor differentiation as the two significant covariates in predicting survival. Positive surgical margins were also significant covariates affecting local recurrence. These data suggest that conservation surgery is an effective treatment for early vocal cord carcinoma. Adequate surgical margins are essential. Postoperative irradiation should be considered in patients with inadequate margins.\r"

Thirty-three patients underwent total laryngectomy with primary pharyngeal closure, 14 patients had, in addition, pharyngectomy and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction, and 5 patients had pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy and gastric transposition. Tracheoesophageal or tracheogastric speech was successful in 58, 86, and 80 percent, respectively. Manometric studies showed that the neopharyngeal sphincter pressure decreased in all instances, but a correlation between the neopharyngeal pressure and the success of tracheoesophageal speech was not demonstrable. The morbidity rate related to tracheoesophageal puncture was low. Therefore, we believe it to be a safe and feasible procedure that can facilitate early voice restoration.\r"

The invasive cancers were more often granular than the in situ cancers. The traditional clinical characteristics of ulceration, induration (palpability), elevation, bleeding, and associated cervical adenopathy were not usually present in these early lesions. We found leukoplakia to be a variable characteristic as opposed to the almost constant presence of erythroplasia.

In comparison to patients with diploid SCC, those with aneuploid SCC had significantly decreased relapse-free and overall survival rates (p less than 0.001 for both). A Cox regression analysis demonstrated that tumor DNA content was a prognostic factor independent of all clinicopathologic features examined.

  ".W": "During a recent 5-year period, 115 patients had 131 supraomohyoid neck dissections. Eighty-one percent of these procedures were performed for squamous carcinoma. Seventy-nine percent of the primary tumors were located in the oral cavity and 16 percent arose in the oropharynx. Almost 80 percent of the necks dissected for primary squamous carcinoma were clinically N0, and occult nodal disease was discovered in 31 percent of these neck specimens. When the supraomohyoid neck dissection specimen showed no involvement, the overall incidence of treatment failure in the neck at 2-year follow-up was 5 percent. Almost all patients with occult squamous carcinoma in the supraomohyoid neck dissection specimen received postoperative radiotherapy, and the failure rate in the neck was 15 percent. When neck nodes were both clinically and pathologically involved, neck recurrence developed in 29 percent of the patients despite the addition of adequate postoperative radiotherapy. Among those patients with nonsquamous primary tumors and a pathologically negative supraomohyoid neck dissection specimen, there was only one subsequent treatment failure in the neck. Supraomohyoid neck dissection appears to be a valid staging procedure for clinically N0 patients with primary squamous carcinomas located in the oral cavity or oropharynx, with an appropriate yield of occult nodal disease, and infrequent treatment failure in the dissected neck when the supraomohyoid neck dissection specimen is pathologically uninvolved. When nodal disease is clinically obvious, treatment failure is more frequent, even with the addition of postoperative radiotherapy. The role of supraomohyoid neck dissection in this setting deserves further study.\r"

The others, in whom parotidectomy and facial nerve dissection were performed, were not suspected of having Warthin's tumor preoperatively or had tumor too close to the facial nerve to be safely enucleated. Patients were generally older and more likely to be male than patients with other benign parotid tumors. Fifteen patients had multiple Warthin's tumors at the time of initial presentation; in an additional 12 patients, Warthin's tumor developed in the opposite parotid gland after the initial operation. In only two patients did an additional tumor develop in a gland from which a Warthin's tumor had previously been enucleated. No permanent injuries to the facial nerve occurred. Because of the safety and efficacy with which enucleation can be performed and because the risk of malignant transformation of Warthin's tumors is extremely small, we believe that enucleation is the treatment of choice in most cases.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a series of 15 patients who presented with masses in the tail of the parotid gland which proved at biopsy to be benign hyperplastic lymphadenopathy similar to lymphoepithelial hyperplasia. There were 11 male and 4 female patients. All had a history of intravenous drug use. Ten patients complained of pain. Six patients had smaller masses on the contralateral side of the gland, whereas seven patients had minor axillary adenopathy. Needle aspiration was performed in 12 patients; although not conclusively diagnostic, it ruled out primary salivary tumors. Thick purulent material was aspirated in five patients. All 15 patients underwent parotid exploration. It was apparent after raising the flap that the disease was related to intraparotid and periparotid lymph nodes. Lymphadenopathy in the jugular region, which was not appreciated preoperatively, was also noted in all patients. Each patient underwent exposure of the main trunk of the facial nerve and limited superficial parotidectomy. The postoperative course in each patient was uneventful and no patient had a facial nerve deficit. Cerebral toxoplasmosis developed in one patient who died 3 months after surgery; AIDS developed in one other patient. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) titers were not performed routinely because none of the patients came for regular follow-up. None of these patients demonstrated lymphoma at the time of this procedure. Parotid lymphadenopathy, which occurs primarily in intravenous drug users, appears to be an early manifestation of pre-AIDS or AIDS-related complex. If patients have no other sizable lymphadenopathy for biopsy, we advocate exploration of the parotid region and excision of periparotid and intraparotid lymph nodes.\r"

The majority of the patients were middle-aged men who had early-stage disease, with only 18 patients in stage III and 6 in stage IV. The epiglottis was the most frequent site, followed by the aryepiglottic fold and other sites in the supraglottic larynx. There was no operative mortality and the complication rate was low. Univariate analysis showed no influence of tumor stage, tumor differentiation, or involved surgical margins on survival. Determinate survival rates of 85 percent at 3 years and 72 percent at 5 years were observed. Local recurrences took place in 12 patients, 4 of whom were salvaged by total laryngectomy; neck failure occurred in 13 patients, 7 of whom were salvaged after further treatment; and 1 of the 2 patients with distant metastasis was salvaged after further treatment. We believe that every patient with a favorable lesion of the supraglottic larynx should be considered for conservation surgery, specifically, supraglottic partial laryngectomy, adhering to the criteria mentioned. Initial surgical treatment offers excellent local control and 5 year survival. Adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy may be considered in those patients with bulky primary tumors, positive surgical margins, and histologically confirmed cervical lymph node metastases.\r"

A small segment of the trachea can be resected and primary anastomosis can be performed easily with satisfactory results. The problem is always complex when a substantial portion of the trachea must be resected. A variety of prosthetic materials have been used, both in experimental animals and human subjects, with limited short-term success. This study describes an experiment using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in dogs. PTFE patch and interposition grafts were used for tracheal reconstruction with very satisfactory results. Inflammatory reaction near the grafts and nonincorporation of long graft segments continue to be problems, but despite this, prosthetic reconstruction of the trachea using PTFE provided very satisfactory results in our experimental study.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine cure rates achievable by surgery and radiotherapy and the factors influencing failure. A chart review of all patients at our institution with desmoid tumors of the head and neck from 1919 to 1982 was undertaken, and pertinent data were tabulated. Forty-eight patients were found with this problem. Average duration of symptoms was 1.6 years, and tumor size ranged from 1 to 12 cm (mean 5.1 cm). Average follow-up was 5.8 years. The most common site of occurrence was the neck (34 patients). Thirty-two patients underwent complete excision with 8 recurrences; 4 were reexcised with no further recurrence at last follow-up. Fourteen patients had incomplete excision with 12 recurrences. Radiotherapy was employed as the primary therapy in two patients; both experienced recurrence. Complete excision is the only effective treatment for desmoid tumors of the head and neck, resulting in a disease-free state in 75 percent of the patients (87 percent after reexcision). Involvement of the brachial plexus was the chief factor precluding complete excision. Radiotherapy was of very little value.\r"

Blood samples were collected throughout the peri-operative period for estimation of plasma morphine concentration using two radio immunoassay techniques, one specific for morphine, the other less specific and crossreacting with morphine glucuronides. Plasma morphine concentrations with the specific method were similar for the two groups of patients but there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups with the less specific method at 30 and 45 minutes after induction of anaesthesia. This difference was because of the varying concentrations of morphine metabolites and may reflect the change in splanchnic blood flow produced by lumbar epidural analgesia.\r"

Significant decreases in arterial blood pressure followed drug administration (mean 35.6%). Decreases in arterial pressure of greater than 30% occurred in 5 out of 14 patients in the low dose group, and 12 out of 14 in the high dose sufentanil group. There was a blunting of the pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation after sufentanil. Increases in blood pressure were seen in both treatment groups at the onset of surgery. The peak responses were 27% increase in mean arterial pressure in the low dose group, and 51% increase in the 1.0 microgram/kg group. There was however no significant change in heart rate. Fourteen patients (8 in the low dose group) required volatile supplementation during surgery for clinical signs of inadequate anaesthesia. This occurred between 21 and 70 minutes after sufentanil administration, and plasma drug concentrations 0.06 and 0.54 ng/ml. Tracheal extubation was successfully achieved at the end of surgery in 26 out of 28 patients at plasma sufentanil concentrations which ranged from 0.03 to 0.37 ng/ml.
