Sixty patients were prospectively randomized to receive a 1-day preparation with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution or a 3-day preparation using a clear liquid diet, cathartics, and enemas. The patient groups were similar in age, race, male-female ratio, and the types of colonic resections performed. Colonic cleansing was better with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution (100% vs 63% \"good\" to \"excellent\" cleansing). Patient tolerance evaluated by a questionnaire showed more overall discomfort with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution but no difference between the preparations in individual symptoms of fullness, cramping, nausea, or vomiting. One patient developed a low level of serum potassium after a cathartic and enema preparation, while there were no complications with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution. Patient taste questionnaires showed a slight preference for sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution (53%) over a polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (47%). This study confirms that sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution is a safe and effective method of preoperative colonic cleansing.\r"

Six of the nine patients had sporadic gastrinomas and became permanently eugastrinemic following excision of nodal metastases and total gastrectomy (n = 4), antrectomy (n = 1), or pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 1) (mean survival, 13 years). The other three patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the multiple endocrine adenopathy type 1 syndrome and became temporarily eugastrinemic after total gastrectomy (mean survival, 11 years). Occult submucosal duodenal-wall microgastrinomas (mean size, 3.0 mm) were found to have been serendipitously excised in four patients. Long-term follow-up of these nine patients, as well as of six other patients described in the literature, demonstrates that excision of occult duodenal-wall gastrinomas provides a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of apparent regression of primary gastrinomas and the eugastrinemia that may follow total gastrectomy.\r"

Wistar rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with zymosan and randomized into control or treatment groups (trimethoprim or streptomycin sulfate). Selective decontamination effectively prevented bacterial translocation of Enterobacteriaceae. However, only early mortality was decreased, and only so in the streptomycin-treated rats.

Pancreatic inflammation was confirmed at surgery in 51 patients, of whom only 27 had stones in the stools (n = 22) or the bile duct (n = 5), suggesting that choledocholithiasis may not be the sole triggering factor of acute gallstone pancreatitis.

All patients underwent either modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy with axillary dissection and whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer. Median follow-up was 6.9 years. We found no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival between patients whose highest or only level of axillary involvement was level I compared with patients whose highest or only level was II. Although patients whose highest level of nodal involvement was III had significantly worse overall survival and disease-free survival rates than patients whose highest nodal involvement was I or II, when patients were stratified by the total number of positive nodes (one to three vs four or more), there was no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival rates between levels I, II, and III. These findings indicate that the level of axillary involvement for stage II breast cancer is not of independent prognostic significance.\r"

There were no significant differences in demographics, mechanisms of injury, types of pancreatic wound, or associated injuries. Sixteen (20%) patients with pancreatic injury during the study period died before the trauma center was established. Of these, 13 (81%) died of hemorrhage. In contrast, five (9%) patients with pancreatic injury who were treated after the trauma center was operational died. Only one death was due to hemorrhage. By relative risk, a patient was 2.67 times more likely to die and 17 times more likely to die of hemorrhage before the presence of the trauma center than after (P less than .03). In this study of a patient population suffering severe intra-abdominal injuries, Organ Injury Outcome Analysis demonstrates that development of a trauma system significantly improves outcome.\r"

The indications for this alternative selective shunt were congenital anomalies of the left renal vein, inadequate outflow from the left renal vein on preoperative venography, or an anatomic relationship of the splenic vein favoring direct splenocaval rather than splenorenal anastomosis. Technical considerations in which splenocaval shunts differ from distal splenorenal shunting relate to exposure of the vena cava. Operative mortality was 7.7% (2/26). Immediate shunt patency was documented in 23 of 24 patients studied, and all 14 shunts studied at 13 to 57 months were patent. Portal perfusion was maintained in 95% (20/21) of the patients when studied at 7 to 10 days after shunting and in 57% (8/14) at late follow-up. This experience with distal splenocaval shunting has reaffirmed its place as an alternative technique to selective distal splenorenal shunts, particularly when the left renal vein is abnormal.\r"

Intestinal decontamination with streptomycin sulfate and bacitracin followed by oral feeding with a streptomycin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli produced monoassociation of the gastrointestinal tract with this microorganism. Using this model, the rate of bacterial translocation at day 3 increased from 6% (1 of 17) to 90% (28 of 31). Cell-associated procoagulant activity was measured in the mononuclear cell population of mesenteric lymph nodes as well as portal and systemic blood and also in hepatic nonparenchymal cells. In monoassociated animals, the procoagulant activity of mesenteric lymph node mononuclear cells was significantly greater than in control animals at day 3 (210% +/- 28% vs 100% +/- 6%) but not at days 1 or 6. Procoagulant activity of hepatic nonparenchymal cells was elevated in monoassociated animals at days 3 and 6 compared with control animals. Both control and monoassociated animals remained well throughout the experiment. The histologic features of the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric nodes, and liver did not differ between groups. These studies provide evidence that bacterial translocation, in the absence of external stimuli, is able to induce cell activation at sites remote from the gastrointestinal tract and may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure.\r"

Following plasma exchange, a reduction in both TNF and interleukin 1 levels occurred, whereas plasma infusion was followed by a decrease in TNF levels only. No significant differences were observed between the two treated groups with respect to survival or cardiovascular performance, with both being significantly enhanced compared with the controls. High levels of TNF and interleukin 1 correlated with depressed cardiovascular performance in the early phase of the shock. Our results confirm the important role of TNF and interleukin 1 as early mediators of septic shock. However, the benefit of reducing cytokine activity in later stages of septicemia seems to be dubious.\r"

To obviate this difficulty as well as to reduce the occurrence of nodules later in a preserved contralateral thyroid lobe and to provide additional thyroid tissue for study, contralateral subtotal or near total lobectomy has been performed for indeterminate thyroid nodules. The small remnant of remaining thyroid tissue can later be ablated by radioactive iodine if desired. Of 37 patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules, none required reoperation, although the diagnosis of carcinoma was established after surgery for eight patients, three of whom were treated with radioactive iodine.\r"

Mafenide acetate, sulfadiazine silver, gentamicin sulfate, neomycin sulfate-polymyxin B sulfate (Neosporin GU irrigant), acetic acid, amphotericin B, and povidone-iodine inhibited the neutrophil oxidative burst at or below clinical concentrations, while 0.25% modified diluted sodium hypochlorite (Dakin's) solution caused cell death. Bacitracin-polymyxin B sulfate (Polysporin) greatly augmented the respiratory burst; this effect was due to the bacitracin component. Diluted gentamicin and acetic acid also augmented intracellular hydrogen peroxide production, but to a lesser extent than Polysporin. Inhibition of the respiratory burst of neutrophils might be considered when these agents are used for topical wound care, although clinical correlates of these effects have not been determined.\r"

One hundred thirty-six operations were performed by 52 surgeons in 31 hospitals. Overall operative mortality was 18%; elective and emergency operative mortality rates were 6% and 49%, respectively. Advancing age did not affect outcome, but mortality due to ruptured aneurysms was higher in smaller hospitals than in larger hospitals. The low mortality for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in an elderly population by numerous surgeons in divergent hospitals is a strong indication for its liberal use compared with the high mortality and morbidity of emergency surgery.\r"

Major complications were further classified by their nature: embolic, occlusive, and technical. All three types of complications occurred more frequently in group 1. Embolic complications occurred more frequently in patients with aneurysms and proved the most lethal, with two of six deaths in group 1 resulting from this complication.\r"

Group B patients had essentially no follow-up until they reappeared for care at the Hernia Service, whereas patients in group C achieved an 82% 7-year follow-up. The infection and recurrence rates of group C patients (0.45% and 0.9%, respectively) were significantly better than those of group B patients (5.9% and 4.6%, respectively). These results suggest that in our institution, the concentration of patients with hernias in a hernia service, manned by a specialized surgeon, produced better short- and long-term results than those obtained by general surgeons not dedicated to the field of hernia repair. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these findings.\r"

In one group (n = 6) without sepsis, PEEP was applied after 1 hour, while a fourth group (n = 5), without sepsis or PEEP, served as a control. The group with PEEP and sepsis had reduced cardiac index, portal venous blood flow, and liver surface blood flow. The group with PEEP alone had reduced splanchnic circulation by increasing gastrointestinal vascular resistance, while the group with sepsis alone had increased portal vascular resistance. In a separate series with sepsis, intermittent PEEP, and vigorous fluid resuscitation, it was demonstrated that avoiding hypovolemia did not seem to protect from the PEEP effects on the splanchnic circulation. The combination of sepsis and PEEP was not additive on portal blood flow reduction but reduced bile production.\r"

We report herein our experience with seven limb-salvage cases in which we closed difficult and complex defects with composite tissue transfers utilizing microvascular techniques. Free-flap transfers were used to cover soft-tissue defects after extensive resection of primary and locally recurrent tumor and to manage radiation-induced complications. The grafts healed well when infected irradiated tissue was covered, and the grafts tolerated postoperative irradiation. Composite tissue transfer also provided soft-tissue coverage around distal joints that would not have been adequately protected with a skin graft. Complications were minimal, and all patients maintained good extremity function. No patient who underwent composite tissue transfer has had a local recurrence. A free-flap composite tissue transfer can extend the indications for limb-salvage surgery and offers an alternative to amputation in selected patients.\r"

We report three cases of asymptomatic C septicum abscesses to document the clinical course of this entity and to establish guidelines for its prevention and treatment. In contrast to previously reported data, C septicum infections can produce abscesses in solid organs, the retroperitoneum, and the extremities. These lesions often occur in patients with cancer, producing liver abscesses without gas formation that may be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma. Symptoms may be minimal or nonspecific before fulminant toxemia. Asymptomatic bacteremia should prompt a search for unsuspected cancer and an abscess. Computed tomography is the diagnostic modality of choice. The treatment consists of surgical debridement of necrotic tissue in concert with an appropriate course of antibiotics. We have found recurrences after adequate debridement and short-term antibiotic therapy, suggesting that prolonged and even lifelong prophylactic oral penicillin G potassium may be necessary to prevent further recurrences.\r"

A method of excision of the tumor and reconstruction of the pancreaticobiliary apparatus was used that eliminated all gross and microscopic disease. Only one of the patients with benign disease (familial polyposis) suffered from local recurrence. All three patients with malignant tumors developed local recurrences within 2 years of resection. Local resection seems to be a viable alternative to Whipple's resection in patients with benign tumors. In malignant cases, local resection should be considered only a palliative procedure and confined to elderly patients with severe concomitant disease and patients in whom a more radical procedure would incur an undue surgical risk.\r"

Over 30 million people in the United States have none, the so-called medically indigent. Among them are over 3 million people with neurologic disorders. They have additional barriers to overcome because often they cannot work, cannot drive, have difficulty using public transportation, and have major cognitive and communication impairments. Medical and governmental bodies are debating solutions to the health care access crisis. Physicians should actively participate in this national debate. Neurologists should address the special needs of patients with neurological disorders.\r"

Health statistics note the persisting gap between minority groups and the nation's norms for life expectancy. Aging America and particularly black elderly women, combined with the lagging infant mortality among minority groups, demonstrate limited access issues beyond economics, reflecting inner city mores, cultural barriers, and communication delay limiting contact with the practicing neurologist. Awareness of such access limitations to neurological care for minorities demands the attention of the practicing neurologist and the neurological societies.\r"

The two magnetic resonance angiographic techniques yielded complementary pieces of information and were used together to compare magnetic resonance angiography with invasive angiography. Comparison of magnetic resonance and invasive angiograms of the 60 carotid arteries shows that the sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%) of the magnetic resonance angiographic techniques we used to diagnose clinically significant carotid stenosis approach but do not reach those of invasive angiography.\r"

All patients suffered indirect trauma to the internal carotid artery resulting in formation of either an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Review of the radiologic and clinical findings was performed in six patients. The diagnosis was established by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. All patients had follow-up clinical evaluation and imaging studies. Treatment by neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiologic procedures resulted in significant visual improvement in five patients. Different pathophysiologic mechanisms could be correlated with the delayed visual loss produced by the two types of lesions. The pathologic changes associated with the aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms included direct compression of optic nerves and/or chiasm and intracranial hematoma. A carotid-cavernous fistula caused delayed visual loss by either hematoma at the orbital apex or compression of the chiasm and/or optic nerves by saccular dilatation of the cavernous sinus. The delayed onset of decreased vision following head trauma should alert the physician to the possibility of a traumatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Different neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms can usually be correlated with the pathologic changes demonstrated by neuroimaging procedures.\r"

Pseudobulbar palsy was partial in five patients. Only one patient had neuropsychologic impairment. The pseudobulbar features improved or recovered within a few weeks in all patients. The common characteristic of the lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was the interruption of the corticonuclear pathways contrasting with marked sparing of the corticospinal pathways in both hemispheres. These lesions were either an opercular infarct, or a deep infarct in the corona radiata or internal capsule, or a lenticular hemorrhage. Hypertension was the most prevalent concomitant. Our findings suggest that acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy has rather stereotyped anatomic-vascular correlates and time course.\r"

We have used xenon 133 single-photon emission computed tomography to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 20 stutterers. Analysis revealed global, absolute flow reductions. Relative flow asymmetries (left less than right) were identified in three hemispheric regions: anterior cingulate and superior and middle temporal gyri. Milder changes were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Stutterers had rCBF values below median for either anterior cingulate or middle temporal gyri. With one exception, severe stutterers had rCBF values below median for the anterior cingulate gyrus. All stutterers with rCBF values above median in the cingulate gyrus had rCBF values below median in the middle temporal gyrus, and severity of their disorder was either mild or moderate. Our findings suggest that stuttering is a neurogenic disorder involving recognized cortical regions of speech-motor control.\r"

The findings by means of muscle biopsies showed abnormalities typical of inclusion body myositis, including abundant lined vacuoles and characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions of 15- to 18-nm filaments. Remarkably, many vacuolated muscle fibers showed immunoreactivity to neural cell adhesion molecule, a fetal muscle antigen. The common origin of these patients from an isolated ethnic group with frequent consanguinity and the familial incidence is indicative of a genetic causation or predisposition, probably with an autosomal recessive inheritance. This familial myopathy is one of several clinical syndromes that share the typical pathological findings of inclusion body myositis. The pathogenic relationship between these different familial forms and the more common sporadic form of inclusion body myositis is not known.\r"

Neurologic declarations are only recently being recognized. We studied 13 cystinotic subjects (aged 5 to 21 years old), determining median motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, F waves, peroneal motor nerve conduction velocities, sural sensory nerve conduction velocities, median sympathetic skin response, electrocardiogram R-to-R variability, and blink reflex analysis. The results were normal. We conclude that neurophysiologic testing suggests relative sparing of the peripheral nervous system in nephropathic cystinosis.\r"

Data from a British study of the prevalence and natural history of dementia, in which diagnoses of dementia were made by clinicians using a new, standardized interview schedule, are presented to demonstrate the effects of physical disability, psychiatric illness, and other factors on memory impairment and performance in everyday life. Our purpose is not to insist that clinicians are always correct but rather to highlight the complexities involved and the need for investigators to be more open about the way in which they distinguish between physical, psychiatric, and cognitive infirmities.\r"

Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group. Semiautomated morphometry was used to measure hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions. The volume of the left posterior perisylvian region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children. Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group. Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures. The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Allochiria is the mislocation of sensory stimuli to the corresponding opposite half of the body or space. Obersteiner (1882) introduced the term allochiria (Greek allos = other + chiria = hand), and more than 20 authors employed it in this context over the next 25 years. Stewart (1894) described a related phenomenon in which stimuli are displaced to a different point on the same extremity. He noted that the displacements were different than allochiria and coined the term allachaesthesia (ie, allesthesia) (Greek allache = elsewhere + aisthesis = perception). Despite this historical background, Jones (1907) redefined both terms in an attempt to increase diagnostic specificity and attributed allochiria to hysteria. Jones' reinterpretation does not appear to be justified historically, etymologically, or scientifically and has resulted in contradictory definitions of allochiria and allesthesia in present-day medical dictionaries and neurologic textbooks. We advocate a return to usage consistent with the original descriptions and word derivations.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Despite oral corticosteroid therapy, some patients with asthma have frequent exacerbations requiring emergency room visits, hospitalization, and occasionally, mechanical ventilation. We compared the effects of high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone with oral prednisone in patients with severe chronic asthma. METHODS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study that spanned all seasons, we treated 12 patients with high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone (360 mg over the first three days of the treatment period) or low-dose oral prednisone (median dose, 12.5 mg per day throughout the period; range 0 to 30). The two three-month treatment periods were separated by a three-month washout period. During all periods the patients were allowed to take additional doses of prednisone for acute exacerbations of asthma. RESULTS. After receiving triamcinolone, the patients had significantly better peak expiratory flow rates than while receiving prednisone (the average [+/- SEM] weekly percent of the predicted value during the triamcinolone period was 91.5 +/- 6.9, as compared with 75.0 +/- 5.9 for the prednisone period; P less than 0.05). During the prednisone period there were 21 emergency room visits and 10 hospitalizations, but there were none during the triamcinolone period (P less than 0.05). There were two episodes of ventilatory failure during the prednisone period. Total steroid doses were significantly smaller during the triamcinolone period than during the prednisone period (P less than 0.04). Steroidal side effects were more pronounced after treatment with triamcinolone than after treatment with prednisone (P less than 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone is more effective than low-dose prednisone in patients with severe, chronic, life-threatening asthma, but steroidal side effects are somewhat worse.\r"

The present population study investigated whether pulse rate (PR) and salt intake interact to determine blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four hour urinary sodium (UNaV) was used as a measure of salt intake. A random population sample, including 2081 subjects with a minimum age of 18 years, was stratified on tertiles of PR. In subjects with a slow PR(less than 68 beats/min) and in those with a fast PR (greater than 78 beats/min), a significant curvilinear relationship between BP and UNaV was found, while in subjects with an intermediate PR the BP-UNaV correlation was not significant. There was also a significant interaction between PR and UNaV, indicating that when UNaV increased from 160 to 300 mmol/24 h, systolic/diastolic BP rose by 2/1 mm Hg in the fast PR third, but declined by 1/1 mm Hg in the slow PR third. These divergent trends could not be explained by smoking habits or alcohol consumption and were still present after cumulative adjustment for other important correlates of BP, ie, gender, age, body weight, urinary potassium, and contraceptive pill intake in women. In conclusion, the present data suggest that in subjects with a pulse rate greater than 78 beats/min a high salt intake may be associated with blood pressure elevation, whereas the opposite tendency is observed in individuals with a pulse rate less than 68 beats/min.\r"

In this study, the relative proportions of five major active renin forms in human peripheral venous plasma were compared before and 2 h after stimulation of renin secretion with both converting enzyme inhibition (quinapril) and upright posture in five patients with essential hypertension. The five major active renin forms were separated by shallow gradient isoelectric focusing and quantitated by radioimmunoassay of generated angiotensin I. Plasma renin activity increased from 1.2 to 5.1 ng AI/mL/h (P less than .05). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the proportions of the two most basic renin forms and a significant decrease in the proportion of the most acidic form in venous plasma. Although the mechanism cannot be determined from this study, the altered renin form profile observed could have resulted from preferential renal secretion and/or altered hepatic extraction of the more basic forms. An altered renin form profile in response to acute stimulation has important physiologic implications. Since the relatively basic renin forms are preferentially degraded they possess shorter half-lives. Additionally, the multiple forms of active renin may be functionally heterogenous. Thus, acute stimulation of renin secretion may result in circulating renin with a shorter duration of action and different functional effects than renin released under steady state conditions.\r"

The mean systolic blood pressures (measured using the tail cuff method) of control and hypertensive rats (aged 7 to 12 weeks) were 113 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 SE, n = 14) and 162 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 SE, n = 17), respectively. Intracellular free Mg2+ levels were significantly depleted in the isolated Langendorff perfused hypertensive rat hearts (452 +/- 39 mumol/L, mean +/- 2 SE, n = 17) compared to control hearts (756 +/- 52 mumol/L, n = 14); however, intracellular pH did not differ in the SHR hearts (7.02 +/- 0.03, mean +/- 2 SE, n = 7) compared with controls (7.03 +/- 0.03, n = 7). Although we could not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the levels of P-creatine or ATP, intracellular Pi was two-fold higher (5.71 +/- 2.28 mmol/L v 2.92 +/- 0.66 mmol/L, n = 4) and the phosphorylation potential, [MgATP]/[MgADP][Pi], was correspondingly lower (3.0 X 10(4) +/- 1.6 x 10(4) v 8.3 X 10(4) +/- 1.4 X 10(4) (mol/L)-1, n = 4) in SHR compared to WKY hearts. These data demonstrate free magnesium depletion in heart muscle and indicate an alteration in cardiac bioenergetics in essential hypertension.\r"

The first-subcultured M cells prepared from isolated glomeruli of Sprague-Dawley rats were used. ET-1 binding was assayed by using 125I-ET-1. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was determined by IP3-specific binding assay. Intracellular calcium (iCa2+) was measured in fura-2 loaded cells. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was measured by radioimmunoassay. In M cells there existed two classes of binding sites specific for ET-1 (Kd was 0.24 and 4.4 nmol/L, Bmax was 130 and 1070 fmol/mg, respectively). ET-1 (10(-7) mol/L) induced a rapid and transient increase in IP3, followed by transient and sustained increases in iCa2+. Nicardipine (10(-6) mol/L) inhibited only the sustained increase in iCa2+. ET-1 (10(-9) mol/L to 10(-7) mol/L) significantly stimulated PGE2 production with the concentration dependency. Nicardipine (10(-6) mol/L) and diltiazem (10(-6) mol/L) did not inhibit the PGE2 production. We conclude that M cells have specific ET-1 receptors linked to phosphoinositide turnover and PGE2 production, and PGE2 production by ET-1 may be through an extra-cellular calcium-independent mechanism. Our results suggest that ET-1 plays an important role in the regulation of glomerular functions by modulating PGE2 production in M cells.\r"

We studied ten conscious normotensive dogs, paced at constant heart rate, to determine the relative probabilities of inducing endocardial ischemia with intravenous sodium nitroprusside or pinacidil, a novel antihypertensive agent. On different days, pinacidil and nitroprusside were infused in each animal to achieve mean aortic pressures (MAP) of 83 +/- 0.2 mm Hg and 62 +/- 1 mm Hg, reduced from control pressures of 106 +/- 3 mm Hg (pinacidil) and 107 +/- 3 mm Hg (nitroprusside). At MAP = 62 mm Hg, pinacidil depressed the left ventricular endocardial:epicardial blood flow (0.81 +/- 0.03) more than did nitroprusside (1.00 +/- 0.06, P less than .01). However, pinacidil increased left ventricular blood flow in all transmural layers at both levels of hypotension (P less than .05); nitroprusside increased only epicardial blood flow at MAP = 62 mm Hg (P less than .05). Neither vasodilator significantly altered myocardial oxygen consumption at either level of hypotension. At MAP = 83 mm Hg, pinacidil depressed the ratio of left ventricular vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance indices (LVVRI/SVRI) 40 +/- 6 percent (P less than .001) to a level below that existing during nitroprusside infusion (P less than .05). These data indicate that pinacidil has greater selectivity for the coronary circulation over the systemic circulation compared to nitroprusside. Although it is unlikely that either drug caused endocardial ischemia in the present study, the data suggest that pinacidil is less likely to do so than is nitroprusside in normal hearts.\r"

Only men aged 40 to 64 years were included in the study. The randomization of patients into the metoprolol (n = 1,609) or diuretic group (n = 1,625) was performed after stratification for age, smoking habits, serum cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. At baseline the two treatment groups were well matched. Metoprolol was given in a mean dose of 174 mg daily and the mean dose of thiazide diuretic was either 46 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily or 4.4 mg bendroflumethiazide daily. Identical blood pressure control was achieved using the fixed therapeutic schedule. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for metoprolol than for diuretics, owing to fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the cardiovascular deaths, 78% were classified as sudden cardiovascular deaths (occurred within 24 h after the onset of symptoms). There were significantly fewer sudden cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group compared to the diuretic group (32 v 45, P = .017). The present results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths than initial diuretic treatment in uncomplicated hypertension.\r"

SBP was correlated negatively with H-NE (r = -0.70, P less than .001) and positively with R-Ca (r = 0.45, P less than .005). R-Ca was negatively correlated with H-NE (r = -0.36, P less than .05). These results suggest that the replacement of chloride with sulfate ion suppresses the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats at least in part by its inhibitory effect on sympathetic nervous activity through the decreased intracellular calcium concentration.\r"

Moreover, prostacyclin, papaverine, iloprost, and forskolin, compounds which stimulate the enzyme adenylate cyclase, and rolipram (neural specific) and milrinone, enoximone, and piroximone (muscle specific) inhibitors of Type III cAMP PDE and degradation of cAMP, do not inhibit nerve stimulation to most blood vessels. The data support the concept that cGMP may act as a negative feedback modulator of physiologic frequencies of sympathetic nerve activity to blood vessels. cAMP does not appear to modulate adrenergic neurotransmission to vascular smooth muscle at physiologic frequencies of neural stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension in insulin resistance states is generally attributed to hyperinsulinemia, with resulting increases in renal sodium retention and/or sympathetic nervous system activity. However, recent data from our laboratory suggest that cellular insulin resistance, rather than hyperinsulinemia per se, may lead to hypertension. The basic tenet proposed in this review is that the common mechanism involved in the development of hypertension in both type I and type II diabetes mellitus is a deficiency of insulin at the cellular level. Recent observations suggest that impaired cellular response to insulin predisposes to increased vascular smooth muscle (VSM) tone (the hallmark of hypertension in the diabetic state). For example, recently reported studies from our laboratory demonstrate that insulin in physiological doses attenuates the vascular contractile response to phenylephrine, serotonin, and potassium chloride. Thus, insulin appears to normally modulate (attenuate) VSM contractile responses to vasoactive factors, and insulin resistance should accordingly be associated with enhanced vascular reactivity. Abnormal VSM cell calcium [Ca2+]i homeostasis may be the nexus between insulin resistance and increased VSM tone. The genetically obese, hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant Zucker rat demonstrates increased vascular reactivity, reduced membrane Ca2(+)-ATPase activity, increased cellular Ca2+ levels, and a marked impairment in vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux compared to lean controls. Insulin stimulates membrane Ca-ATPase, blocks Ca2+ currents, and Ca2(+)-driven action potentials. Thus, an insulin-resistant state as exists in the Zucker rat may be associated with increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels and/or decreased production or activation of the VSM cell Ca-ATPase pump.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both cell types elaborated an extensive extra-cellular matrix in culture composed of a different blend of connective tissue macromolecules.

To differentiate changes in Ca2+ metabolism in hypertensive arteries from secondary phenomena due to the arteriosclerosis, the animals were examined in the earliest stage of hypertension. It was found that the Ca2+ content was not elevated in the aortic smooth muscle of SHR aged 1 week (n = 11), as compared to normotensive controls (n = 10) (186.8 +/- 89.9 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 254.0 +/- 173.3 micrograms Ca2+/g). The Ca2+ content was raised (P less than .05) in the aortic smooth muscle of SHR aged 4 weeks (n = 13), as compared to 12 WKY rats (4 weeks) (726.0 +/- 130.4 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 440.3 +/- 214.4 micrograms Ca2+/g) and in 17 SHR (3 months), as compared to 13 WKY rats, respectively (3390.1 +/- 729.9 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 1632.1 +/- 569.5 micrograms Ca2+/g). The results confirm the age-related increase in the arterial Ca2+ content in normotensive rats and demonstrate additionally that this age-related rise in arterial Ca2+ content is accelerated in SHR.\r"

None of the major therapeutic trials in hypertension have provided evidence that reducing blood pressure reduces the risk of atherosclerotic complications of hypertension. Hypertension certainly aggravates the severity of atheromatous lesions in experimental animals and, thus, may do so in humans. However, atherosclerosis is more closely related to disturbances in lipoprotein metabolism than to other factors. The common finding that serum cholesterol is raised in hypertensive patients may be due to atherosclerosis being the primary lesion, with the hypertension as a secondary complication rather than the primary lesion.\r"

Further questions remain concerning the incidence of pseudohypertension and the potentially harmful effects of its treatment on the brain, and the possibility that fluctuations in blood pressure may be worse than elevation alone. A pragmatic approach would be to treat hypertension with vigor in the young, with caution in the mature, and with reluctance in the old.\r"

  ".W": "Effective antihypertensive agents have been available for the last four decades. Their use in the treatment of hypertension has resulted in a marked decline in hypertension-induced morbidity and mortality. There are, however, some notable shortcomings with the currently available antihypertensive therapies, including disappointing effects against coronary artery disease and the fact that, even with treatment, hypertensive patients still have considerably higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than matched normotensives. This may be due to insufficient lowering of the elevated arterial pressure in hypertensive patients. In theory, overtreatment may also constitute a risk, considering the J-curve phenomenon. Other factors which may play a role are the different pathophysiological mechanisms in stroke and myocardial infarction, the potentially negative metabolic effects induced by some antihypertensive drugs, the importance of cardiovascular hypertrophy (in particular, left ventricular hypertrophy), and the inability of some antihypertensive agents to reverse such changes. To rectify some of these shortcomings, a more effective antihypertensive therapy is required. Ideally, an antihypertensive agent should provide effective lowering of blood pressure, in most patients to normotensive levels, while being devoid of potentially negative metabolic effects. It should also induce reversal of the changes of cardiovascular hypertrophy and, if possible, limit tissue damage if and when a vascular complication occurs.\r"

The structure of the L channel is known and the (different) binding sites for various calcium antagonists have been identified using the methods of molecular biology. Although calcium slow-channel antagonists are very widely used in the treatment of hypertension, advances in the clinical pharmacology of angina and, to a lesser extent, cardiac arrhythmias, have not kept up with the basic research in molecular biology. All of the calcium antagonists in current use dilate arteries, and their therapeutic action largely depends on this property. There is evidence of differences in response between arteries and veins, and some degree of selectivity between vascular territories, but the goal of much more specific or localized vasodilation has not been achieved. The most prominent difference between the three main classes of antihypertensive drugs is the mild reflex increase of heart rate seen with the dihydropyridines and the bradycardia seen with verapamil. Most of the side effects of calcium antagonists are also based on vasodilatation, such as flushing and headache. The mild edema often seen with the dihydropyridines probably depends on the changes in capillary pressure brought about by arterial dilatation. Despite their undoubted efficacy as vasodilators, there are no studies thus far which allow any conclusions as to the long-term effect of calcium antagonists on the morbidity and mortality due to hypertension.\r"

Permanent hypocalcemia (8%) and unilateral laryngeal nerve injury (2.3%) were the major complications, with 0.8% having fatal complications. The achievement of long-term normal serum calcium levels has been the most frequent complication. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury had a significant relationship with secondary procedures, histologic findings, and no nerve identification during surgery.

Data were obtained through a retrospective review of these cases. The cases were divided into three age groups that reflected the developing structure of the mandible and the maturation of the dentition. A trend toward a greater number of fractures and a predominance of males is shown with increasing age. Child abuse is a relatively frequent cause of fractures throughout all groups. Associated injuries are more common in young children, except in cases where abuse has been documented. The high osteogenic potential of the pediatric mandible allowed conservative management to be successful in 25% of younger patients and was responsible for a low complication rate overall.\r"

  ".U": "91214654\r", 
  ".W": "An experience of 154 patients undergoing palatoplasty or pharyngeal flap surgery at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center (Sacramento) was retrospectively analyzed. There were 114 palatoplasties, 37 pharyngeal flaps, and three combined palatoplasty and pharyngeal flap procedures performed. Factors that could affect postoperative airway compromise, as well as those thought to influence the number of days hospitalized postoperatively, were evaluated using a three-way analysis of covariance. Some degree of airway compromise occurred in 24 patients. The duration of mouth-gag usage strongly correlated with the incidence and severity of airway compromise. Neither steroids nor antibiotics decreased the incidence of respiratory compromise. However, steroids were associated with a decrease in number of days hospitalized (2.7 days vs 4.2 days). The use of intraoperative antibiotics was also associated with a shorter hospitalization (3.5 vs 4.0 days) and with fewer cases of postoperative fever. The high correlation between significant respiratory compromise and duration of mouth-gag usage, as well as clinical observations, suggest that airway compromise in these patients is due to edema of the tongue and related structures secondary to ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Cystic hygromas usually present in infancy or early childhood as compressible masses that may rapidly and intermittently enlarge. While they may arise in any anatomic location, hygromas of the head and neck are especially difficult to manage since enlargement may cause serious sequela such as airway obstruction, feeding difficulties, and speech pathology. Complete extirpation of these lesions is often impossible, and recurrence rates are accordingly high. We reviewed our 10-year experience in treating cervicofacial cystic hygromas. Of 34 patients, 21 had lesions cephalad to the hyoid and 13 had lesions caudal to the hyoid. While none of the 13 children with infrahyoid lesions demonstrated feeding or respiratory difficulties, eight of 21 children with suprahyoid involvement presented with dysphagia or airway compromise. The recurrence rates for infrahyoid and suprahyoid lesions were 15% and 81%, respectively. Those children with suprahyoid hygromas also experienced an increased operative complication rate compared with patients with infrahyoid involvement. Principles of management for suprahyoid and infrahyoid lesions are described, including the specific management of lingual, submandibular, parotid, and parotofacial hygromas.\r"

Of the 75 respondents who had access to a large adult cuff 54 (72%) had used it on 'less than two occasions' over the preceding four weeks. Only 10% (9) of respondents reported that they record blood pressure to the nearest 2 mmHg and 23% (22) reported that they round blood pressure readings to the nearest 10 mmHg. There were diverse views on the interpretation of multiple blood pressure recordings. The conclusion is that compliance with current recommendations on blood pressure measurement technique in pregnancy is poor. There is poor agreement among midwives and obstetricians as to how blood pressure should be recorded in pregnancy.\r"

By using data held at the National Medical Birth Registry, Stockholm, 91 such pregnancies (study cases) where one or both twins died were identified. For each case, two controls (in all 182 pregnancies) were allotted at random from the rest of the twin pregnancies, with similar birthweight (+/- 100 g) and year of delivery (+/- 1 year). The number of twins that died was reduced from 73 during the first four years to 22 between 1977 and 1980, and to 6 during the last 3 years of the study period. Almost a quarter (23.1%) had a lethal malformation. The caesarean section rate increased during the study period, but did not differ between cases and controls (chi 2 = 1.0; P greater than 0.05). The analysis could not confirm a significant difference between cases and controls regarding the number of infants born vaginally in non-vertex presentation (chi 2 = 0.1; P greater than 0.05). The results of this study appear to indicate that birth by caesarean section was not a major factor related to the improved fetal outcome.\r"

There was very little correlation between these variables (r = 0.13, falling to r = 0.07 after birthweight was adjusted for initial maternal weight and length of gestation), i.e., women who gained more fat during their pregnancies did not give birth to heavier babies. This suggests that for most women one of the principal effects of increasing food intake during pregnancy may be to increase maternal fat gain rather than promote fetal growth, and that efforts to increase birthweight by encouraging greater weight gain during pregnancy may be unsuccessful.\r"

Many smokers want to stop smoking but decline clinical treatment when it is offered. The aim of this study was to find a method which was accepted by a large number of smokers, had a high success rate and, at the same time, required little involvement from personnel. For one year, all pregnant smokers attending 13 of the 14 public health maternity clinics in Gothenburg for their first appointment were invited to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria were daily smoking, a gestational age of less than 12 weeks and ability to understand Swedish. A total of 745 women was registered, but 22 of them stopped smoking before the treatment. The remaining women were randomized to a treatment group (n = 492) and a control group (n = 231). Of the 492 women in the treatment group 417 (85%) accepted the idea of using the self-help manual written especially for pregnant women and given to each woman in the treatment group by the obstetrician. Overall 10.4% of the treatment group stopped smoking up to 8 weeks after delivery compared with 5.2% of the control group (odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.9). The ex-smoking status was verified by measurement of thiocyanate in blood. The self-help manual had a high acceptance rate and a success rate that was double the rate in the control group.\r"

Colposcopy and biopsy results were obtained for positive cases. A comparison was made with a group of 1007 women attending the same clinic for routine cytology only. Nearly 10% of women who were screened by cervicography had a technically defective cervicogram, the main single reason being that the view was obscured by blood. Routine cytology was positive in 1%, while cervicography was positive in 13%, where positivity was defined as a result leading to a recommendation for colposcopy. The false positive rate for cervicography was 26%. Even after adjustment, this difference was highly significant (P less than 0.0001).\r"

All patients were seropositive for herpes simplex viral antibody. Virus was isolated from the tear film postoperatively in one patient and on cocultivation from the cornea of another patient. Herpes simplex viral DNA, however, was detected in the corneas of all patients from group A and half of those from group B by means of the polymerase chain reaction and primers to three well separated regions of the viral genome. Three donor corneas had no evidence of herpes simplex viral DNA. Using RNA polymerase chain reaction, we found evidence of a latency associated transcript and also that of a glycoprotein C coding transcript in two corneas, indicating viral replication. Nine corneas had evidence of a latency associated transcript but no glycoprotein C transcript, which suggests that herpes simplex virus may be maintained in a latent state in the corneas of patients with prior herpes simplex keratitis and in some patients with corneal disease unrelated to the herpes simplex virus.\r"

Nine out of 10 patients had symptoms of systemic vasculitis on presentation; seven had renal impairment; three had chest x-ray abnormalities. Autoantibodies against neutrophil cytoplasmic determinants (ANCA) were present in all cases. In seven patients the scleritis responded well to pulsed immunosuppressive therapy followed by long term oral steroids and cyclophosphamide. Oral steroid therapy alone failed to control severe disease. Corneoscleral disease was not a cause of visual loss. It is important to realise that inflammatory corneoscleral disease may be the presenting feature of a severe systemic vasculitis.\r"

A positive test was not associated with the anatomical site of the uveitis but was related to the time course of the disease. In particular single/repeated rather than nonrecurrent uveitis was associated with a positive test. Three groups of patients seem more likely to have positive tests: those with bilateral chronic posterior uveitis; a group with an anterior uveitis which is single/repeated who were younger than 46 at disease onset and had isolated eye disease; and an older group, aged 60 years or more at onset, with single/repeated uveitis and systemic features.\r"

This complicates diagnosis. PPD, unlike ICE, is familial, and ICE, unlike PPD, is usually progressive and frequently complicated by glaucoma: thus it is important to distinguish between them. To determine whether this could be achieved by specular microscopy, since the posterior corneal surface is abnormal in both conditions, 57 cases of ICE and 44 of PPD were repeatedly examined and photographed with the specular microscope. Progressive and/or static morphological features of the corneal endothelium and Descemet's membrane were found that were specific for each condition. Specular microscopy can thus provide a definitive diagnosis of ICE or PPD even in uncertain cases.\r"

The charts were divided into two groups: (A) 208 charts and (B) 137 charts according to the number of isoptres investigated: two (V4, 112) or three (V4, 112, 12). In group A the AP was more often altered than the GP, and the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In group B the GP seemed more effective, but the number of questionable cases was greater and the difference was not statistically significant. When the most internal isoptre of GP was outside the central 30 degrees, AP was more often abnormal (29%) than GP (2.2%), and the difference was statistically significant (chi 2, p less than 0.001). Within the central 30 degrees the GP seemed more often to be altered (23% of cases) than the AP (19.4%), but one-third of the cases were questionable. Within the central 30 degrees both techniques gave identical results and there was no statistically significant difference. The discrepancies between both static and kinetic techniques are an argument for their complementary use.\r"

No difference in the mydriasis produced by drops of small and normal volume could be detected.

The prevalence of headache with two migrainous features or more (probable migraine) was 17% in LTG, 11% in POAG, and 12% in normal subjects. The prevalence of headache with three migrainous features (classical migraine) was 5% in LTG, 3% in POAG, and 3% in normal subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any types of migraine between the three groups of patients (p greater than 0.05).

In both genotypes progression of PSR was most frequent between ages 20 and 39 years. Spontaneous regression was more common in SS disease (p = 0.01), and more likely to proceed to complete non-perfusion. In SC disease PSR tended to be stable in patients aged 40 and over, and non-perfused PSR lesions were significantly more likely to reperfuse (p = 0.01) than in SS disease. In both genotypes regression was not influenced by size or elevation of the PSR lesion. The tendency for PSR to regress in SS disease suggests that treatment is unnecessary in SS patients aged 40 and over.\r"

Although it is systemically controllable with a good chance of spontaneous remission, persistent loss of binocularity may cause chronic disability. We report our experience of extraocular muscle surgery in five patients with stable myasthenia gravis and persistent double vision. Extraocular muscle involvement was selective, giving rise to incomitant and concomitant squints, with individual muscle overactions as well as underactions. Treatment was by conventional recession and resection procedures with the additional use of Faden and adjustable sutures where appropriate. In all five cases a larger, stable field of binocular single vision was established. It is concluded that extraocular muscle surgery may be beneficial in selected cases of myasthenia gravis.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales by country of birth of the deceased. DESIGN--Standardised mortality ratios were computed by country of birth groups for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease for 1979-83 and 1970-2 by using the five year age-sex specific rates for England and Wales for 1979-83 as standard. SETTING--England and Wales 1970-2 and 1979-83. RESULTS--In 1979-83 mortality from ischaemic heart disease was highest in men and women born in the Indian subcontinent (standardised mortality ratio 136 and 146 respectively). Young Indian men suffered the greatest excess (313 at ages 20-29). Other groups with raised mortality included Irish, Scottish, and Polish born immigrants. Those born in the Caribbean, the old Commonwealth, west Europe, and the United States had low death rates. In England and Wales mortality from ischaemic heart disease declined by 5% in men and 1% in women between 1970-2 and 1979-83, with greatest percentage declines in immigrants born in the United States, South Africa, the old Commonwealth, the Caribbean, and France. immigrant groups with raised mortality in the earlier period showed little improvement, and mortality from ischaemic heart disease increased among Indians (6% in men and 13% in women). In 1979-83 mortality from cerebrovascular disease was highest in Caribbeans (standardised mortality ratios 176 in men and 210 in women), followed by Africans, Indians, and Irish. Rates were low in west Europeans. Mortality from stroke declined by 28% overall in this period, a rate of decline shared by most groups. Men from the Indian subcontinent showed a decline of only 3%. CONCLUSION--In the 1980s mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease differed significantly between ethnic groups in England and Wales. In general, ethnic groups that experienced lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s showed the greatest improvement over the following decade.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare a combination of epidural fentanyl and bupivacaine with bupivacaine alone for epidural analgesia in labour and to evaluate factors in addition to analgesia that may influence maternal satisfaction. DESIGN--A prospective randomised pilot study. SETTING--Birmingham Maternity Hospital. SUBJECTS--85 primiparous women who requested epidural analgesia in labour and their babies. INTERVENTIONS--Group 1 mothers were treated with bupivacaine conventionally, group 2 mothers with bupivacaine and fentanyl in a more complex way designed to provide satisfactory analgesia but with less troublesome side effects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Overall maternal satisfaction, maternal perception of epidural analgesia and its side effects, and aspects of mothers' psychological states during labour, quantified using 100 mm visual linear analogue scales; the frequency of normal and operative deliveries; and measurements of neonatal wellbeing. RESULTS--Satisfaction was higher in group 2 mothers (median group difference +3 mm, 95% confidence interval +1 to +5, p = 0.012): this was associated with more normal deliveries (difference between proportions 0.23, 95% confidence interval +0.03 to +0.42); greater self control (median group difference -7 mm, -17 to -2, p = 0.003); and reduced unpleasantness of motor blockade (-10 mm, -19 to -5, p less than 0.001), sensory blockade (-5 mm, -11 to -2, p = 0.002) and shivering (-5 mm, -18 to 0, p = 0.046) at the expense of mild itching (0 mm, 0 to 0, p less than 0.001). Group 1 mothers found restricted movements more unpleasant (-1 mm, -11 to 0, p = 0.006) and were more sleepy (-4 mm, -20 to 0, p = 0.032). The addition of fentanyl to bupivacaine reduced the requirement for local anaesthetic (-33 mg, -55 to -15, p less than 0.001) without compromising analgesia. No adverse effects in neonates were attributed to the use of fentanyl. CONCLUSIONS--The already high maternal satisfaction from conventional epidural analgesia can be improved; epidural fentanyl may be combined with bupivacaine to reduce operative deliveries and confer other advantages that may increase maternal satisfaction. Further investigations should be performed to determine the exact mechanisms of these findings and, in particular, to develop a safe method of delivering such analgesia to women.\r"

SETTING--Teaching hospital casualty x ray department. PATIENTS--3394 consecutive patients referred for radiography. INTERVENTIONS--Radiographs were assessed by radiographers who were offered a four point triage scheme: normal, abnormal, insignificantly abnormal, or further advice required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Comparison of radiographers' assessments with an assessment made independently by the reporting radiologists. RESULTS--Overall disagreement between the radiographers and radiologists was 9.4%. There were 7% false positives and 14% false negatives. Most errors occurred in assessing radiographs of the skull, facial bones, chest, abdomen, and soft tissues. CONCLUSION--Unselected radiographers can offer useful advice on radiographs to casualty officers, but their high rate of false positive diagnoses indicates that they cannot triage casualty radiographs sufficiently accurately to allow them to extend their current reporting role.\r"

Information on parents was obtained by home interview. SETTING--Three areas in north England: Copeland and South Lakeland (west Cumbria); Kingston upon Hull, Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Holderness (north Humberside), and Gateshead. SUBJECTS--109 children aged 0-14 born and diagnosed as having leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in study areas during 1974-88. Two controls matched for sex and date and district of birth were obtained for each child. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Occupations of parents and specific exposure of parents before the children's conception, during gestation, and after birth. Other adults living with the children were included in the postnatal analysis. RESULTS--Few risk factors were identified for mothers, although preconceptional association with the food industry was significantly increased in case mothers (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.00). Significant associations were found between childhood leukaemia and reported preconceptional exposure of fathers to wood dust (2.73, 1.44 to 5.16), radiation (3.23, 1.36 to 7.72), and benzene (5.81, 1.67 to 26.44); ionising radiation alone gave an odds ratio of 2.35 (0.92 to 6.22). Raised odds ratios were found for paternal exposure during gestation, but no independent postnatal effect was evident. CONCLUSION--These results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small numbers, overlap with another study, and multiple exposure of some parents. It is important to distinguish periods of parental exposures; identified risk factors were almost exclusively restricted to the time before the child's birth.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine whether the observed excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the area around the Dounreay nuclear installation is associated with established risk factors, or with factors related to the plant, or with parental occupation in the nuclear industry. DESIGN--Case-control study. SETTING--Caithness local government district. SUBJECTS--14 cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurring in children aged under 15 years diagnosed in the area between 1970 and 1986 and 55 controls matched for sex, date of birth, and area of residence within Caithness at time of birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Antenatal abdominal x ray examination; drugs taken and viral infections during pregnancy; father's occupation; father's employment at Dounreay and radiation dose; distance of usual residence from the path of microwave beams, preconceptional exposure to non-ionising radiation in the father; and other lifestyle factors. RESULTS--No raised relative risks were found for prenatal exposure to x rays, social class of parents, employment at Dounreay before conception or diagnosis, father's dose of ionising radiation before conception, or child's residence within 50 m of the path of microwave transmission beams. Results also proved negative for all lifestyle factors except an apparent association with use of beaches within 25 km of Dounreay. However, this result was based on small numbers, arose in the context of multiple hypothesis testing, and is certainly vulnerable to possible systematic bias. CONCLUSION--The raised incidence of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around Dounreay cannot be explained by paternal occupation at Dounreay or by paternal exposure to external ionising radiation before conception. The observation of an apparent association between the use of beaches around Dounreay and the development of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma might be an artefact of multiple testing and influenced by recall bias.\r"

DESIGN--Detection of sequences with the polymerase chain reaction in a well defined group of patients with the syndrome and controls over the same period. SETTING--Institute of Neurological Sciences, Glasgow. SUBJECTS--60 consecutive patients admitted to the institute with the postviral fatigue syndrome who had undergone extensive investigation to exclude other conditions. 41 controls from the same catchment area without evidence of fatigue, all undergoing routine surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Routine investigations, serological screen for antibodies to a range of viruses, and presence of enteroviral RNA sequences in muscle biopsy specimens. RESULTS--15 (25%) patients and 10 (24.4%) controls had important serological findings. 12 patients had neutralising antibody titres of greater than or equal to 256 to coxsackieviruses B1-5 (six positive for enteroviral RNA sequences, six negative); three were positive for Epstein-Barr virus specific IgM (two positive, one negative). Six controls had similar neutralising antibody titres to coxsackieviruses (all negative); one was positive for Epstein-Barr virus specific IgM (negative); and three had titres of complement fixing antibody greater than or equal to 256 to cytomegalovirus (all negative). Overall, significantly more patients than controls had enteroviral RNA sequences in muscle (32/60, 53% v 6/41, 15%; odds ratio 6.7, 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 18.2). This was not correlated with duration of disease, patient and age, or to raised titres of antibodies to coxsackieviruses B1-5. CONCLUSIONS--Persistent enteroviral infection of muscle may occur in some patients with postviral fatigue syndrome and may have an aetiological role.\r"

DESIGN--Study of all necropsies in one hospital in 1987 and longitudinal analysis of results of necropsy in 1957, 1964, 1975, and 1987. SETTING--Departments of general surgery, infectious diseases, internal medicine, oncology, and orthopaedics in a Swedish general hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of cases of venous thromboembolism. RESULTS--About a third of all necropsies showed venous thromboembolism. In 1987, 260 of 347 necropsies showing venous thromboembolism found pulmonary embolism, of which 93 were classified as fatal, 90 as contributory, and 77 as incidental. Only 21 contributory or fatal postoperative pulmonary emboli were seen. In only 106 of 260 patients with pulmonary embolism did routine necropsy not show the source of embolism. Calf veins were not routinely examined. Deep venous thrombosis was seen in 239 patients in 1987. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in the four years studied was remarkably stable except in the department of orthopaedics, where the proportion fell from 60.7% in 1975 to 32.2% in 1987 (p less than 0.05), although there were only a few patients. CONCLUSIONS--The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism has not changed over 30 years. During this period the proportion of the population aged over 65 has doubled, and this may have masked the beneficial effects of prophylaxis and early mobilisation. Prevalences corrected for age are needed.\r"

Endoscopy and histological examination was performed with the examiner blind to whether or not the patient had dyspepsia. SETTING--Population based survey in Sorreisa, Norway. SUBJECTS--All people with dyspepsia and age and sex matched people without dyspepsia were offered endoscopy. A total of 309 people with dyspepsia and 310 without dyspepsia underwent endoscopy, giving 273 matched pairs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of endoscopic and histological diagnoses made according to internationally accepted standards. RESULTS--In all, 1802 of 2027 (88.9%) people returned the questionnaire. Of the 163 subjects who refused endoscopy, 114 were controls. Of five endoscopic and four histological diagnoses only peptic ulcer disease, endoscopic duodenitis, and active chronic gastritis were diagnosed significantly more often in people with dyspepsia. In all, 30% to 50% of the diagnoses of mucosal inflammation and peptic ulcer disease were made among subjects without dyspepsia, and only 10% of both those with and those without dyspepsia had normal endoscopic findings. CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic findings, with possible exceptions of peptic ulcer disease and endoscopic duodenitis, showed no association of clinical value with dyspeptic symptoms. The small number of \"normal\" endoscopic findings in both those with and those without dyspepsia challenge well accepted endoscopic and histological diagnostic criteria with relation to the upper gastrointestinal tract.\r"

SUBJECTS--126 men aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 at examination randomly selected from a population based sample of 2682 men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Increase in maximal carotid intima media thickness. RESULTS--The mean increase in the maximal common carotid intima media thickness after two years was greater in men with high serum copper concentrations (0.16 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 17.6 mumol/l; p = 0.010), those with low serum selenium concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.09 mm in men with concentrations greater than or equal to 1.40 mumol/l; p = 0.035), and those with raised serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 4.0 mmol/l; p = 0.032) after adjustment for age and cigarette pack years in a three way analysis of covariance. A raised serum low density lipoprotein concentration was associated with accelerated progression of atherosclerosis only in men with higher than median serum copper concentrations (net difference 0.22 mm; p less than 0.001 for two way interaction), and this synergism was even more pronounced in men with serum selenium concentrations below the median value (net difference 0.41 mm; p = 0.042 for three way interaction). CONCLUSION--These data provide evidence of a synergistic effect of copper (a pro-oxidant), a low serum concentration of selenium (a cofactor of an enzyme that scavenges free radicals), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in atherogenesis.\r"

SETTING--433 general practices throughout the United Kingdom that used a commercial computer system linked to a central databank. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Incidence of influenza. RESULTS--The slope of the influenza epidemic curve was essentially the same whether derived from the routine computerised data or royal college's weekly returns service data, and the computerised data were geographically consistent. Throughout the study period, however, the computer derived incidence was between one third and one quarter of that derived from the royal college's system (which is served by practitioners trained in surveillance methods). The peak weekly rates were 164 cases per 100,000 for the computerised system and 583 cases per 100,000 for the royal college's surveillance system. CONCLUSIONS--The apparent underreporting in the routine computerised data probably reflects lack of motivation and experience in disease surveillance and haphazard computer entry (particularly of consultations that took place outside of the surgery and consultations that did not result in a prescription), along with overestimation of the population under surveillance. Nevertheless, routine computerised surveillance allows rapid data collection from a large number of practices over a wide geographical area and would greatly augment existing methods.\r"

DESIGN--Hospital consultants' letters in the manual records of selected general practitioners were photocopied and the consultants' clinical diagnoses were compared with diagnoses recorded on computer. SETTING--General practices in the United Kingdom using computers provided by VAMP Health for recording clinical information. SUBJECTS--2491 patients who received one of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and who attended 58 practices whose computer recorded data were considered after a preliminary review to be of satisfactory quality. RESULTS--Among 1191 patients for whom consultants' letters were forwarded a clinical diagnosis reflecting the diagnosis noted on a consultant letter was present on the computer record for 1038 (87%). CONCLUSION--Clinical information available on the computer records of the general practitioners who participated in this study is satisfactory for many clinical studies.\r"

Magnetic resonance images were obtained with a 0.5 T superconductive MR scanner (Phillips Gyroscan S5). Initial imaging was performed within 24 hours after trauma in 13 patients, 1-7 days in 13 patients and 7-14 days in five patients. Twenty-six patients underwent follow-up examinations with MR imaging. Cord abnormalities including cord compression (23 patients), cord swelling (seven patients), and abnormal signal intensities on either T1 or T2-weighted images (26 patients) were observed on initial examination. Multivariate analysis showed that cord compression and abnormal intensities on T1-weighted images were important prognostic indicators. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images was non-specific but correlated well with clinical recovery. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in predicting the prognosis and for planning treatment following spinal cord injuries.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, at 1.5 T, in addition to magnetic resonance imaging and mammography, was performed on the breast tissue of 59 subjects, using a 40 mm or 80 mm surface coil for spectral localization. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, 46 control subjects; Group 2, nine patients with breast carcinoma; Group 3, four patients with benign breast disease. The relationship of age, menopausal status, breast size and pattern, use of contraceptive pill and history of breast disease to spectral characteristics of breast tissue was examined for the control group. In multivariate analysis, only menopausal status and age were found to be significantly related to tissue biochemistry. Pre-menopausal women had reduced phosphocreatine (PCr) (%) (p = 0.02), and increased phosphomonoesters (PMEs) and beta-nucleotide triphosphate (beta-NTP) (%) (p = 0.05), while the fat-to-water ratio was higher in older women (p = 0.02). No significant differences were identified between the control subjects and the patients with benign breast disease. When spectra from patients with breast carcinoma were compared with an age-matched volunteer group, alpha- and gamma-NTP (%) were found to be higher in the cancer tissue (p less than 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively), while PCr (%) was reduced (p less than 0.01). The ratio beta-NTP:PCr was higher in the carcinoma group of patients (p less than 0.05). In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive examination which may prove useful in the early differentiation of malignant breast disease from normal and benign conditions.\r"

There was a strong correlation between results obtained from each machine for the same skeletal site. The correlation coefficients for the spine and femoral neck were 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. The differences between results from each machine were normally distributed with a mean bias of 37.5% for the spine and 27.8% for the femur, which arise principally from differences in machine calibration. In each case the BMD was greater when measured by X-ray absorptiometry. The range for the bias was approximately 25-50% for the spine and 10-45% for the femoral neck. The results from these two machines are not interchangeable. When subjects who are participating in long term studies using a radioisotope densitometer are transferred to an X-ray densitometer, an individual conversion factor must be measured at each site for each subject.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in women and intravenous urography (IVU) is a frequently requested radiological investigation for recurrent UTI. The aim of this study was to assess whether pelvic and renal ultrasound combined with a plain film of the abdomen (KUB) could replace IVU as the initial radiological investigation in young women with recurrent UTI. Ninety-four young women with recurrent UTI who were referred for IVU were studied. Ultrasound of the pelvis and renal tract was performed, and information obtained from ultrasound and KUB was compared with that obtained from the IVU examination. Patient management was altered as a result of radiological investigation in eight cases. A case of staghorn calculus and a case of pelviureteric junction obstruction were diagnosed by both IVU and ultrasound with KUB. An intrarenal abscess was diagnosed by ultrasound in a patient with a normal IVU. In addition ultrasound demonstrated significant findings in the pelvis, including ovarian and uterine abnormalities and an ectopic and an intrauterine pregnancy. In all cases the patient had symptoms referable to the urinary tract and a history of documented UTI. The KUB did not yield any unsuspected finding not diagnosed by ultrasound, but did serve to delineate more clearly the extent of calculus disease in two patients. We suggest that ultrasound of the pelvis and renal tract combined with a KUB should be the radiological investigation of choice in young women with UTI.\r"

It is concluded that good catheter design should ensure that there is no sudden change in stiffness along the length of the catheter, and that the optimum relationship of ductility to stiffness has not yet been defined for catheters. Recommendations relating to these characteristics could be included in the British Standards relating to angioplasty balloon catheters.\r"

  ".W": "The second British Institute of Radiology trial of dose fractionation in radiotherapy compared two groups of prospectively randomized patients with squamous carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx; one group was treated in a short (less than or equal to 4 weeks) and the other in a long (greater than 4 weeks) overall time. Treatment in any one centre could be given, with no planned gap in the course of treatment, either as a conventional, daily (5 fractions per week regime) or as 3 fractions per week. A total of 611 patients were allocated to treatment, of whom nine have had to be excluded from the analysis for a lack of information. Patients were admitted to the trial from January 1976 to December 1985 and were followed up for a maximum of 10 years and a minimum of 3 years. A reduction in total dose was made for use in the short compared with the long treatment regime. This reduction in total dose varied between 18% and 22% depending on whether 5 fractions or 3 fractions per week regimes were used. Overall, no statistically significant differences have been found between the two arms of the trial. The patients treated with 5 fractions per week in a short overall treatment time showed fewer late normal tissue effects. An analysis based on stratification by age, stage and anatomical site gave a relative risk (short/long overall treatment time) for deaths of 1.23 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.96 to 1.59. Analyses stratified for stage and site gave relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of 1 x 10 (0.84-1.44) for local recurrences/tumour persistence, and 1.01 (0.70-1.45) for laryngectomies.\r"

  ".W": "The linear-quadratic (LQ) model for fractionated external beam therapy has been modified by previous authors to include the effects due to an exponentially decaying dose rate. However, the LQ model has now been extended to include a general time varying dose rate profile, and the equations can be readily evaluated if an exponential radiation damage repair process is assumed. These equations are applicable to radionuclide directed therapy, including brachytherapy. Kinetic uptake data obtained during radionuclide directed therapy may therefore be used to determine the radiobiological dosimetry of the target and non-target tissues. Also, preliminary tracer studies may be used to pre-plan the radionuclide directed therapy, provided that tracer and therapeutic amounts of the radionuclide carrier are identically processed by the tissues. It is also shown that continuous radionuclide therapy will induce less damage in late-responding tissues than 2 Gy/fraction external beam therapy if the ratio of the maximum dose rate and the sublethal damage repair half-life in the tissue is less than 1.0 Gy. Similar inequalities may be derived for beta-particle radionuclide directed therapy. For example, it can be shown that radionuclide directed therapy will induce less damage to slowly repopulating tissue than 2 Gy/fraction external beam therapy for the same total dose if the maximum percentage initial uptake in tissue is less than 0.046%/g or 0.23%/g for an injected activity of 50 mCi of 90Y or 131I, respectively.\r"

Timed 24-h urine samples were collected over the same period to assess the relationship between dietary intake of nutrients and urinary risk factors for calcium stones. After standardisation for sex, age and social status a total of 128 subjects underwent final statistical analysis; 64 renal stone formers and 64 controls. Significant increases in the consumption of animal and vegetable protein and purine were identified as the nutritional factors that distinguished renal stone formers from controls. As expected, the daily urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate was higher and the daily urinary excretion of citrate was lower in stone formers than in controls. No difference with respect to daily urinary uric acid excretion was recorded. Daily urinary excretion of calcium was correlated to dietary protein intake while daily urinary oxalate was correlated to dietary vitamin C intake. It was concluded that renal stone formers could be predisposed to stones because of their dietary patterns. A link between the protein content of the diet and urinary calcium was confirmed, but dietary animal protein had a minimal effect on oxalate excretion.\r"

A significant increase in urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and alkaline phosphatase, with return to pre-treatment values within 4 to 5 days, reflected transient disturbances in proximal tubular function. Urinary albumin excretion was increased 0-24 h after ESWL. No significant alterations were observed in plasma renin activity or serum aldosterone due to ESWL. Serum lactic dehydrogenase remained significantly increased for 2 weeks. In addition, significant changes in several blood and urine parameters were caused by immersion in water and intravenous infusions during treatment and were not specifically due to ESWL.\r"

There was a significant quantitative predominance of the smooth muscle constrictor eicosanoids, PGF2 alpha and TXA2 over the dilatory PGE2 in tissue from all sites--renal pelvis, ureter and bladder. The results indicate that prostaglandins play a direct role in smooth muscle activity of the upper urinary tract and the inhibition of this activity with indomethacin indicates a further mode of its action in pain relief in ureteric colic.\r"

Some element of hydroureteronephrosis was noted at initial cystography in 89% of refluxing renal units, but the degree of renal abnormality at 99Tc DMSA renography was not predicted by the severity of VUR. Overall, 60% of refluxing renal units were renographically abnormal. Although a high rate of urinary infection was encountered during follow-up, most DMSA assessments were carried out prior to infection and hence likely reflect congenital rather than acquired abnormalities. It was concluded that renal impairment associated with high grade primary VUR is frequently present at birth and not secondary to subsequent infection.\r"

Inability to perceive cold sensation in the bladder was common in cases of neurogenic lesions and present in nearly half of the patients with outlet obstruction, some with no urodynamic abnormalities and some of the normal subjects. The bladder contractions provoked by the test were clearly associated with detrusor overactivity, as in those patients with upper motor neuron lesions of motor urgency, but 27% of such patients showed no response. In 7 cases the iced water provoked detrusor contractions when cystometry showed no overactivity. This clinical series confirms that the cold receptors found recently in animal experiments are also present in the human urinary bladder. The bladder cooling test is not an alternative to cystometry, but its inclusion as an integral part of the urodynamic examination seems to be useful, especially in cases where there is also a need to study the sensibility of the bladder at the same time.\r"

  ".W": "Enterocystoplasty is being used with increasing frequency in the treatment of patients with idiopathic detrusor instability. We have performed a prospective clinical and urodynamic study of this procedure in 11 patients using both conventional (CMG) and ambulatory monitoring techniques (AM). Nine of 11 patients were satisfied with the symptomatic outcome, but 7 relied on clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to achieve a good result. Urodynamic studies demonstrated a significant increase in residual urine volume from 48 +/- 72 ml before to 347 +/- 298 ml after operation, but there was only a small and statistically insignificant increase in cystometric capacity. Detrusor instability, present before operation in all patients, could still be demonstrated in over half of them after operation. However, a significant decrease in the severity of instability was found after operation as assessed by an increased volume at first unstable contraction. The bladder volume before operation at which the first unstable contraction occurred was smaller in those who still had persistent instability after enterocystoplasty compared with those in whom instability could not be identified after operation. These results suggest that all patients about to undergo ileocystoplasty should be trained in the use of CISC. In selected patients with idiopathic detrusor instability refractory to other treatment, this procedure can yield satisfactory results.\r"

The proximal end of the stent was placed over the verumontanum unless fertility was contemplated, when it was placed immediately below the verumontanum. Fifteen patients achieved complete voiding after placement of the first stent; 3 developed bladder neck obstruction after stenting, but in 1 of these cases resolution occurred after bladder neck incision. The 3 patients with artificial urinary sphincters failed to improve after stenting. Use of the urethral stent for patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and failed sphincterotomy is a major advance. It should probably be the primary treatment in selected cases. Its effect on fertility is currently under assessment.\r"

The mean follow-up time was 20 months. Urodynamic evaluation showed a low pressure reservoir with a mean capacity of 580 ml and normal closure pressure. Sensitivity of the bladder to cold was normal in the augmentation group but was lacking in all patients in the total substitution group. In all except 1 patient the neobladder emptied effectively upon straining without significant residual urine. Seventeen patients were completely continent by day and 10 by night; 1 patient developed hyperchloraemic acidosis requiring treatment. Bladder substitution is superior to the standard ileal or colonic conduits with regard to quality of life, and the use of a right colonic segment is functionally comparable with neobladders composed of the ileum or a combination of the right colon and ileum. The latter are more difficult to fabricate and so may have more complications.\r"

This has been shown experimentally to result in a reduction in the contractility of the neobladder, although contractions are not completely abolished. Incontinence, especially nocturnal, may still be a problem. Assessment of renal function has shown a marked incidence of upper tract dysfunction despite detubularisation. All patients remain at risk of upper tract obstruction following cystoplasty. Because bowel contraction waves are brought on by distension, it may be possible either to postpone or to prevent the onset of contractions by avoiding an excessive build-up of bladder volume. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation is an efficient means of emptying the bladder, although sphincter rebalancing may also be required.\r"

With one exception (prostatic carcinoma), the benign character of the disease was confirmed. Urogenital infection was the most frequent concomitant finding (50%); in 26 men chronic prostatis was diagnosed. Other disorders such as hypertension and coagulation disorders played a minor role. Additional investigation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by transrectal prostatic ultrasonography revealed persistent asymmetry of the latter glands as the main finding in 20 men (28%). In every case seminal vesicle carcinoma was excluded; haemorrhage due to cystic distension, inflammatory lesions or ductal obstruction was associated in all cases with congenital abnormalities, chronic urogenital infection, coagulation disorders or hypertension.\r"

Until recently, attempted revascularization by thromboembolectomy or vascular reconstruction held the best chance of limb salvage. Thrombolytic techniques afford an alternative method of management for this condition and are effective in selected patients. Low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase is the most established method of thrombolysis, although the recently developed tissue plasminogen activator offers a promising alternative. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is not an easy option, being labour intensive and requiring close co-operation between surgeon and radiologist. Thrombolytic and surgical techniques are not mutually exclusive but are best used to complement each other. Ideally patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by surgeons with knowledge of, and access to, optimal current surgical and non-surgical techniques.\r"

A variety of treatment methods are used to control or reduce the profuse sweating which involves mainly the palms, soles and axillae. The simplest method, the application of topical agents, is usually attempted first for axillary and plantar sweating. Iontophoresis may provide relief especially in patients with plantar or palmar involvement. In severe cases operative intervention is necessary. Excision of sweat glands is successful in patients with axillary hyperhidrosis but the role of suction-assisted removal of axillary sweat glands remains to be determined. Sympathectomy remains the standard by which other treatments must be judged. For upper thoracic sympathectomy a variety of surgical approaches are used with satisfactory relief of hyperhidrosis. Complications related to the surgical approach, such as Horner's syndrome, brachial plexus injuries, pneumothorax and painful scars may occur, while following sympathectomy compensatory hyperhidrosis is usual and hyperhidrosis may recur. Plantar hyperhidrosis which may be exacerbated or ameliorated by upper thoracic sympathectomy and which fails to respond to non-operative intervention is relieved by lumbar sympathectomy.\r"

Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative blood loss is an important factor in reconstructive surgery for aortoiliac disease because it is clearly associated with an increase in the operative morbidity and mortality rates. To minimize intraoperative blood loss, a blood-tight vascular prosthesis has been developed by impregnating a knitted Dacron prosthesis with bovine collagen. To study a potential reduction of intraoperative blood loss using these collagen-impregnated prostheses, we conducted a prospective randomized trial involving the collagen-impregnated prosthesis and its non-impregnated substrate, the Dacron knitted non-impregnated prosthesis. During a 2.5-year period, 123 consecutive patients (undergoing 81 procedures for aneurysmal disease and 43 procedures for occlusive disease) were admitted for elective aortic reconstructive surgery. Equal numbers of the two prostheses were randomly implanted. Various parameters were monitored: intraoperative blood loss before aortic cross-clamping (phase 1), during implantation of the prosthesis (phase 2) and after release of aorta cross-clamping (phase 3); the number of intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusions; and, finally, all preoperative and intraoperative factors that might contribute to intraoperative blood loss. A significant overall difference in intraoperative blood loss between the collagen-impregnated (2425 ml) and the non-impregnated (1907 ml) group was found (P = 0.003). However, this difference could not be attributed to collagen impregnation because no statistically significant difference in blood loss was found in the relevant period of operation (phase 3). Similar results were observed in patients operated on for both aneurysmal and occlusive disease (2600 versus 2195 ml and 2105 versus 1344 ml respectively).\r"

The mortality rate when one of these complications occurred was 22 (63 per cent) representing 11.5 per cent of the 191 deaths from all causes in the series. The relative risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication was 1:249 when the heart was not opened, 1:66 when it was and 1:5 after cardiac transplantation. Gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 20) was the most common complication of whom nine (45 per cent) died, followed by intestinal infarction (n = 12) with eight (67 per cent) deaths and acute pancreatitis (n = 6) all of whom died. There was one death after surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 7). No patient survived bowel infarction without operation but resection was possible in five of the eight who underwent surgery, four of whom survived. The results demonstrate that surgical intervention is not associated with undue mortality but inappropriate conservative therapy is poorly tolerated in this high-risk group.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of platelets on the development of intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts was investigated using canine poor run-off models. A new apparatus consisting of a shielding lead block to measure in vivo platelet adherence only on the intima of the vein graft was developed. In 23 dogs, 51Cr-labelled platelets (20 microCi/kg) were injected and isotope emission over the grafts was counted. Platelet adherence was expressed as the thrombocyte accumulation index (TAI), i.e. the ratio of counts over the graft under an abnormal flow condition in the poor run-off model to those over the graft under normal flow conditions of the contralateral leg. The TAI of the total graft (TTAI) was significantly high immediately and on the first and third days after implantation. The TAIs of the proximal (PTAI) and distal (DTAI) portions of the vein graft were also high at these same times. At 7, 10, 14 and 21 days, the TAI was almost equal to 1.0, a time at which endothelial regeneration was complete as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Thus, the prominent intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts in dogs, induced under an abnormal flow condition, correlates well with the enhanced platelet adherence on the intima of the vein grafts in an early period after implantation.\r"

Of these, 202 underwent an anterior resection, 85 an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and 16 a coloanal anastomosis. Surgery was considered palliative in 52 patients undergoing anterior resection and 24 undergoing abdominoperineal resection. The 30-day hospital mortality rate was six patients (3 per cent) for anterior resection and two patients (2 per cent) for abdominoperineal resection. Peroperative anastomotic testing demonstrated leakage in five stapled anastomoses; these were rectified and no clinical sequelae occurred. Two patients (1 per cent) developed a clinical anastomotic leak, one of which proved fatal; in each case the intraoperative test was negative. The overall 5-year survival rate was 64 per cent after anterior resection and 52 per cent after abdominoperineal resection; the median follow-up was 64 months. The incidence of local pelvic recurrence was 6.4 per cent after anterior resection and 14 per cent after abdominoperineal (not significant). These results confirm the success of sphincter-saving anterior resection combined with total mesorectal excision, routine full mobilization of the splenic flexure and cancercidal lavage of the distal rectum in the treatment of low rectal carcinomas; morbidity, local recurrence and survival are not compromised.\r"

In the remaining seven patients both parts of the sphincter were intact and a linear relationship was found between the resting anal canal pressure and the endosonographic thickness of the internal anal sphincter. Twenty-eight out of 33 (85 per cent) patients with incontinence of traumatic origin had external sphincter defects, confirmed by concentric needle electromyogram mapping in the 19 patients in whom this was performed. Eleven of these 28 (39 per cent) patients also had disruption of the internal sphincter.

Of 207 patients with surgically proven appendicitis the inflamed appendix (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) had been visualized sonographically in 177 (86 per cent). The score for non-perforated appendicitis (91 per cent) was higher than for perforated appendicitis (55 per cent). Twenty-four patients in whom an inflamed appendix was seen on ultrasonography did not undergo surgery because of rapidly subsiding symptoms ('abortive appendicitis'). Four of these 24 developed recurrent appendicitis warranting surgery. Two underwent elective appendectomy and 18 have remained symptom-free. Of 155 patients with a subsequently confirmed alternative condition, ultrasonography made the correct diagnosis in 140: bacterial ileocaecitis (69), mesenteric lymphadenitis (eight), gynaecological conditions (34), urological conditions (eight), caecal diverticulitis (six), perforated peptic ulcer (six), Crohn's disease (two) and miscellaneous conditions (seven). Of 139 patients in whom no definite diagnosis was made ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in 138. In four patients a false positive sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis was made and in two patients with appendicitis an alternative condition was incorrectly diagnosed. During the last 3 years of the study the negative appendicectomy rate was 7 per cent and delay beyond 6 h after admission occurred in only 2 per cent of patients with surgically proven appendicitis. When used to complement the clinical diagnosis ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and patient management in those suspected of having acute appendicitis.\r"

Sixty-one consecutive patients with colon injury were seen between 1978 and 1989 and 57 of these (93 per cent) underwent primary repair. In four a colostomy was constructed. Emergency repair was carried out regardless of site or mode of injury, presence of hypotension or peritoneal contamination. There was one death unrelated to anastomotic complications and one anastomotic leakage. The faecal fistula closed spontaneously in 4 weeks. The wound infection rate was 10 per cent. These data support the emerging view that primary repair of colon injury is the management of choice.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis have an excess risk for adenomas and cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. In the upper intestine these lesions occur mainly around the ampulla of Vater and they parallel mucosal exposure to bile. In view of this finding and of evidence that bile acids play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, biliary bile acid profiles were determined in 29 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (12 before colectomy, 17 after colectomy) and in 28 patients without familial adenomatous polyposis (all with colons in situ). Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis had a higher total biliary bile acid concentration than the others. The bile of patients with polyposis had a greater proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid and a lower proportion of deoxycholic acid than did the bile of patients without polyposis. The ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid and its metabolite lithocholic acid to cholic acid and its metabolite deoxycholic acid, which is related to subsequent bile acid profiles in the colon, was higher in patients with polyposis. Because bile acids influence cellular proliferation, these findings may be of importance with respect to intestinal adenoma and cancer growth.\r"

The hepatic perfusion index was raised 10 days after the inoculation of cells (at the micrometastatic stage) and when overt tumour was present 20 days after inoculation. Overt tumours were hypovascular compared with normal liver. Portal venous flow and portal venous inflow fell significantly when the hepatic perfusion index was increased, but hepatic arterial flow did not alter. Portal vascular resistance and splanchnic vascular resistance were both increased in tumour-bearing animals but portal pressure, arteriosystemic shunting and portosystemic shunting did not increase significantly at any stage during the growth of hepatic tumour. These findings confirm that the hepatic perfusion index can be elevated in the presence of both micrometastic and overt hepatic tumour and that the changes are not due to either arteriosystemic shunting or mechanical portal venous obstruction.\r"

In vitro experiments have shown oestradiol to be trophic to gastric cancer cell lines. The effect of D5 (an oestrogen receptor-related protein) status on survival was therefore studied in a group of 188 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Ninety-two patients (49 per cent) were positive for the D5 antibody. There were no differences between the D5-positive and D5-negative groups for age or adverse prognostic features such as high grade tumours or advanced stage. The D5-negative patients had a significant survival advantage over the D5-positive patients. The 95 per cent confidence interval for survival in the patients with D5-negative tumours was 63-101 weeks compared with 39-66 weeks for the patients with D5-positive tumours (Mantel-Cox statistic = 4.15, P = 0.042). Prognostic factor analysis with a Cox proportional hazards model showed tumour stage (P = 0.001) and D5 status (P = 0.003) to be significant independent factors in gastric cancer. Lauren type, grade and gender were not significant independent factors in this small series.\r"

  ".U": "91215445\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 611 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastric cardia were operated on between July 1982 and December 1989. Resection was performed in 491 patients (one-stage, 483; two-stage, eight), bypass operation in 97, and 23 had exploration alone. The anastomoses of 580 patients with one-stage resection and bypass operations were evaluated. Hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer of continuous absorbable monofilament suture was performed in 304 patients (221 resections and 83 bypasses). A stapled anastomosis was performed on 276 patients (262 resections and 14 bypasses). Following resection, there were 11 (5 per cent) anastomotic leaks in the hand-sewn group and ten (3.8 per cent) in the stapled anastomosis group (P = 0.69). Excluding anastomotic leaks, hospital mortality and anastomotic recurrence, stricture occurred in 18 of 172 hand-sewn anastomoses (10.5 per cent) and in 57 of 195 stapled anastomoses (29.2 per cent) (P less than 0.001). In patients who had bypass operations there were 12 anastomotic leaks, ten in the hand-sewn group (12.0 per cent) and two in the stapled anastomosis group (14.3 per cent). Only two of the discharged patients with bypass developed anastomotic strictures, a low incidence probably because of short survival. In addition, there were 245 subsidiary anastomoses made in the abdomen by the hand-sewn method as part of the reconstructive procedure, and there was one leak. The results of this non-randomized study suggest that hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer continuous technique for the oesophagus is as safe as the use of circular staplers; hand-sewn anastomosis is less likely to become stenotic.\r"

The single most important factor resulting in complications was the omission of crural repair; of seven patients without crural repair, five developed paraoesophageal hernia/recurrence. Four patients required repeat fundoplication for severe recurrent symptoms and one of these developed the unusual complication of pericardiogastric fistula. Thirteen patients had strictures before operation from reflux oesophagitis, six (46 per cent) resolved after fundoplication alone, six responded to dilatation (mean five sessions), and one required colon interposition. Our preliminary experience with balloon dilatation was encouraging: three of three patients responded after one dilatation only. These results confirmed the efficacy of surgery in controlling reflux: 100 per cent in the short-term and 89 per cent on a 1-6 year follow-up. Major complications might well be reduced by routine crural repair.\r"

The 30-day operative mortality rate in the study period was 15 per cent (28 out of 183) but in the subsequent 4-year period this fell to 7 per cent (5 out of 69). The survival rate correlated significantly with depth of invasion but not with tumour site or degree of differentiation. The incidence of early gastric cancer in this series was 5 per cent but the 5-year survival rate in this group was 52 per cent suggesting that the true incidence might be even lower. The overall 5-year survival rate in our area 20 years ago was only 5.2 per cent but in this series it was 11 per cent overall and 24 per cent after resection, and with actuarial correction 15 per cent overall and 28 per cent after resection. The continuing improvement in operative mortality rates and in 5-year survival rates gives grounds for optimism, but the disease must be diagnosed earlier if this improvement in outlook is to continue.\r"

Survival rates were similar in subsets of patients with or without microscopic node metastases and macroscopically normal lymph nodes. The extent of node metastases has previously been shown to be one of the two most important prognostic factors in gastric cancer without distant metastases, and its lack of impact in these patient groups was not explained by the imbalance of other prognostic factors. The findings indicate that micrometastases of gastric cancer are curable by a wide node dissection made in the absence of palpable abnormality. They also offer the possibility that an extensive node dissection may yield good stage-specific survival rates, in part because of upstaging of patients. The findings should influence the recording of node metastases for evaluation of stage-specific treatment results and for research purposes.\r"

A slight decrease in mean heart rate of 5 to 6 beats/min was noted immediately after the instillation of either the 2.5% or 5% solution. The results suggest that lower doses of topical phenylephrine are safer than higher doses when used preoperatively. This may be particularly significant in hypertensive patients, who have higher baseline blood pressure.\r"
