  ".W": "There has been recent interest in the development of problem-based human genetics curricula in U.S. medical schools. The College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University has had a problem-based curriculum since 1974. The vertical integration of genetics within the problem-based curriculum, called \"Track II,\" has recently been revised. On first inspection, the curriculum appeared to lack a significant genetics component; however, on further analysis it was found that many genetics concepts were covered in the biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, and clinical science components. Both basic science concepts and clinical applications of genetics are covered in the curriculum by providing appropriate references for basic concepts and including inherited conditions within the differential diagnosis in the cases studied. Evaluations consist of a multiple-choice content exam and a modified essay exam based on a clinical case, allowing evaluation of both basic concepts and problem-solving ability. This curriculum prepares students to use genetics in a clinical context in their future careers.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify its physiologic role, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was examined in normal skin fibroblasts and was shown to be the tissue-nonspecific (TNS) isoenzyme type (as evidenced by heat and inhibition profiles) and to be active toward millimolar concentrations of the putative natural substrates phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP). Fibroblast ALP has a low-affinity activity, with a distinctly alkaline pH optimum (9.3), toward 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP), PEA, and PLP but a more physiologic pH optimum (8.3) toward physiologic concentrations (micromolar) of PEA and PLP. Normal fibroblast ALP is linked to the outside of the plasma membrane, since in intact cell monolayers (1) dephosphorylation rates of the membrane-impermeable substrates PEA and PLP in the medium at physiologic pH were similar to those observed with disrupted cell monolayers, (2) brief exposure to acidic medium resulted in greater than 90% inactivation of the total ALP activity, and (3) digestion with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) released about 80% of the ALP activity. Hypophosphatasia fibroblasts were markedly deficient (2%-5% control values) in alkaline and physiologic ALP activity when 4-MUP, PLP, and PEA were used as substrate. The majority of the detectable ALP activity, however, appeared to be properly lipid anchored in ecto-orientation. Thus, our findings of genetic deficiency of PEA- and PLP-phosphatase activity in hypophosphatasia fibroblasts, as well as our biochemical findings, indicate that TNS-ALP acts physiologically as a lipid-anchored PEA and PLP ectophosphatase.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the biochemical basis for the disorder pseudohypophosphatasia (PsHYPT) in one patient by examining the substrate specificity and localization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in cultured dermal fibroblasts. Despite substantial ALP activity, in cell homogenates, toward the artificial substrate 4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP), there was a marked deficiency in ALP activity toward the natural substrates pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and phosphoethanolamine (PEA), indicating altered substrate specificity. Furthermore, although 4-MUP phosphatase (4-MUP-P'tase) activity was predominantly localized as an ecto-enzyme, the small amount of PLP phosphatase (PLP-P'tase) activity was intracellular. This differential localization was apparent in intact cells, since (1) brief acidification of the medium at 4 degrees C inactivated a majority of the 4-MUP-P'tase activity but only 15% of the PLP-P'tase activity (in contrast to greater than 85% inactivation of both in homogenates), (2) greater than 70% of the 4-MUP-P'tase activity but only 30% of the PLP-P'tase activity was released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) digestion, and (3) degradation of extracellular PLP was less than 35% of that of disrupted cells. Both 4-MUP- and PLP-P'tase activities were predominantly in a lipid-anchored form that could be converted to a soluble, lipid-free form by PI-PLC digestion. Our findings suggest that the clinical and biochemical presentation of this PSHPT patient results from the production of two aberrant ALP species. One form of ALP has appropriate ectoorientation but is preferentially deficient in activity toward natural substrates; the other ALP species has appropriate substrate specificity but is sequestered from substrates by its intracellular location.\r"

Here we report a GA patient of Danish/Swedish ancestry in whom one OAT allele produces an mRNA that is missing a single 96-bp exon relative to the normal mRNA. Polymerase-chain-reaction amplification and sequencing revealed a 9-bp deletion covering the splice acceptor region of exon 5, resulting in the absence of exon 5 sequences from the mRNA with no disruption to the reading frame. This mutation, which was not present in 15 other independent GA patients, adds to the array of allelic heterogeneity observed in GA and represents the first example of a splicing mutation associated with this disorder.\r"

A patient has previously been described who, in addition to AIED, manifested a contiguous gene syndrome which included congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC), glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In the present paper report we report the molecular genetic analysis of his deletion. Initially, multiplex polymerase-chain-reaction amplification was used to screen for a DMD-locus deletion which was then further characterized, using DMD cDNA and genomic probes, via Southern blot analysis. The deletion includes the region encompassed by probes C7 (DXS28) and DMD cDNA 8. Probes B24 (DXS67) and DMD cDNA 5b-7 show normal hybridization patterns and appear to flank the deletion, while the DMD cDNA 8 detects a junction fragment.

A genomic subclone and a cDNA clone encoding human IDUA were used to localize IDUA to chromosome 4p16.3 by in situ hybridization and this was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. This localization is different from that of a previous report mapping IDUA to chromosome 22 and places the gene for IDUA in the same region of chromosome 4 as the Huntington disease gene. Measurement of expressed human IDUA activity in human-mouse hybrid cell lines confirmed that IDUA is on chromosome 4.\r"

We identified compound heterozygous mutations in a mut0 fibroblast cell (MAS) line by cloning the methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing with internal primers, and confirming the pathogenicity of observed mutations by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Both mutations alter amino acids common to the normal human, mouse, and Propionibacterium shermanii enzymes. This analysis points to evolutionarily preserved determinants critical for enzyme structure or function. The application and limitation of cDNA cloning by PCR for the identification of mutations are discussed.\r"

In order to determine whether all French-Canadian TSD patients were homozygotes for the deletion allele and to assess the geographic origins of TSD in this population, we ascertained 12 TSD families of French-Canadian origin and screened for occurrence of mutations associated with infantile TSD. DNA samples were obtained from 12 French-Canadian TSD families. Samples were analyzed using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplification followed by hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) or by restriction analysis of PCR products. In some cases Southern analysis of genomic DNA was performed. Eighteen of the 22 independently segregating mutant chromosomes in this sample carried the 7.6-kb deletion mutation at the 5' end of the gene. One chromosome carried the 4-nucleotide insertion in exon 11 (a \"Jewish\" mutation). In this population no individuals were detected who had the substitution at the splice junction of exon 12 previously identified in Ashkenazi Jews. One chromosome carried an undescribed B1 mutation; this allele came from a parent of non-French-Canadian origin. Patients in three families carried TSD alleles different from any of the above mutations. The 5' deletion mutation clusters in persons originating in southeastern Quebec (Gaspe) and adjacent counties of northern New Brunswick.\r"

In several reports, the paternal homologue was preferentially retained in embryonal tumors associated with loss of particular chromosomal regions, suggesting genomic imprinting of the corresponding tumor suppressor loci. To explore the generality of these findings and the possible role of genomic imprinting in adult tumors of the nervous system, we have determined the parental origin of chromosome 22 loss in sporadic meningioma. Of nine cases studied, five tumors retained the maternally derived chromosome 22 homologue while four retained the paternally derived chromosome 22. Thus, in contrast to the embryonal tumors, the meningioma locus on chromosome 22 is inactivated by random mutation in sporadic adult meningiomas.\r"

Mediating these activities are two receptor subtypes, D1 and D2, which are biochemically and pharmacologically distinct. The D1 subtype, the most abundant form of dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, stimulates adenylate cyclase, modulates D2 receptor activity, regulates neuron growth and differentiation, and mediates several behavioral responses. Recently we reported the cloning of a human D1 dopamine receptor gene (DRD1). High-stringency hybridization of the DRD1 clone to human genomic blots suggests that DRD1 is single copy. When used to probe a Southern blot made with DNAs from a rodent-human somatic cell hybrid panel, DRD1 hybridized to a 6.5-kb EcoRI restriction fragment which was assigned to chromosome 5. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of this gene to human metaphase chromosomes refined the location of DRD1 to 5q35.1. A search for RFLPs associated with DRD1 identified a two-allele EcoRI RFLP, allowing confirmation of DRD1's localization by linkage analysis in Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families.\r"

An evaluation of these mutations in combination with previously described point mutations in the factor IX gene of Asians indicates that transitions predominate followed by transversions and microdeletions/insertions. Transitions at the dinucleotide CpG are a dramatic hot spot of mutation. This pattern of mutation is very similar to that observed in Caucasians with hemophilia B, despite the many differences between Asians (mostly Koreans) and Caucasians in diet, environment and cultural life-styles. The similarity may reflect the predominance of endogenous processes or ubiquitous mutagens rather than specific mutagens in the environment. The following additional conclusions emerge: (1) The missense mutations in Asians occur at evolutionarily conserved amino acids. When combined with the previous data this makes it likely that more than two-thirds of the missense mutations which could possibly occur at nonconserved amino acids do not cause hemophilia B. (2) Surprisingly, a change in the sixth base of the intron 2 donor splice-junction sequence is associated with severe disease in HB 74/77. (3) Direct carrier testing of nine Korean families demonstrates that the stability of DNA at ambient temperature in blood with the anticoagulant ACD solution B makes it feasible for a diagnostic laboratory to perform such testing at a distance of 7,000 miles. Carrier testing revealed that the mutation in HB78 arose in his mother's germ-line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These markers were in absolute linkage disequilibrium with the HRAS1 VTR, allowing the assignment of unique upstream haplotypes to each of the four common VTR alleles. Analysis of 17 rare alleles revealed a stratification of allele fragment size and upstream haplotype in which each rare VTR allele possessed the markers characteristic of the common allele nearest in size. Therefore, hyperallelism emanated from the four common alleles in a defined fashion, the size of a rare allele specifying its origin. As discussed below, this result implies that unequal crossing-over between homologues is unlikely to be the predominant mechanism for generating new VTR alleles at this minisatellite locus.\r"

Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus. These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the AT locus at 11q23.\r"

  ".W": "Regions of abrupt genetic change, which result from either rapid spatial change of selective pressures or limited admixture, were investigated in Europe and Asia on the basis of eight red cell markers typed in 960 samples. Two methods were employed, one based on genetic distances and one on evaluation of the first derivative of the surfaces representing allele-frequency variation. Genetic divergence tends to be maximal between populations that are separated by physical factors (mountain ranges and seas) but also separated by cultural barriers (different language affiliation). This suggests that mating isolation, rather than adaptive response to environmental change, accounts for spatially abrupt genetic change at the loci studied and that cultural differences associated with language contribute to isolating populations. Although selection may have determined two wide allele-frequency gradients, the genetic structure of European and Asian populations seems primarily to reflect isolation by distance when investigated on a small scale and migration patterns (or absence of migration) when investigated on a larger scale.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of daily cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy for the systemic vasculitides have led us to evaluate alternative approaches to treatment in an attempt to achieve comparable efficacy with less toxicity. This study sought to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and immunologic effects of glucocorticoids (GC) and intermittent high-dose intravenous CP (\"pulse\" CP) in the treatment of 14 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of active WG was supported by a typical clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis. GC treatment was initially provided on a daily basis and later tapered to an alternate-day schedule if vasculitis remained inactive. Pulse CP treatment was initially administered once a month for 6 months. If after 6 months remission had been attained and GC therapy had been discontinued, then pulse CP treatment was given at less frequent intervals thereafter. Treatment and evaluation were provided for participants as inpatients in a clinical research center (National Institutes of Health). RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) initially experienced unequivocal improvement with pulse CP therapy, and seven of 14 (50%) achieved remission within 4 months. However, treatment was associated with significant toxicity in two patients and later relapses in nine patients, so that a total of 79% either failed to achieve sustained remission or were unable to continue therapy. Three of 14 (21%) patients have achieved sustained remissions with the pulse CP protocol and one additional patient (who had a limited exacerbation of WG) continues to receive that therapy after 14 to 22 months (mean 17 months). CONCLUSIONS: The use of pulse CP and GC therapy in 14 patients with WG was associated with a high initial response rate. However, failure to respond initially to treatment, to sustain improvement, or to tolerate continued treatment was noted in 79% of patients within a period of 1 to 22 months. These observations indicate that this particular pulse CP protocol does not achieve a high degree of lasting efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: On the assumption that renal tubular cells are more important as the target cells for a natriuretic factor than blood cells, we used a well-characterized cultured renal tubular cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), cells to monitor the circulating digitalis-like factor in human plasma and examine its role in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of plasma on binding of radioactive ouabain to monolayered MDCK cells in order to determine the level of a circulating digitalis-like factor. First, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding to MDCK cells in the presence of plasma from 71 outpatients (34 normotensive subjects and 37 hypertensive patients) after incubation for 4 hours. Second, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding after incubation of cells with plasma from 16 hospitalized subjects (eight normotensive subjects and eight hypertensive patients) receiving low and high sodium diets. RESULTS: In Study 1, ouabain binding was lower by 30% with plasma from hypertensive patients than with plasma from normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between individual subject's systolic or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.34, p less than 0.01 or r = -0.29, p less than 0.01). In Study 2, ouabain binding was also significantly reduced by 25% in the presence of plasma from hypertensive subjects as compared with plasma from normotensive subjects irrespective of sodium intake (p less than 0.01). A significant negative correlation was also found for all subjects between either systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01, r = -0.51, p less than 0.01, or r = -0.55, p less than 0.01, respectively). With the changes from low to high sodium intake, there was a corresponding decrease in ouabain binding (p less than 0.01) and an increase in sodium excretion (p less than 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between these two parameters (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a circulating digitalis-like factor, which may act on renal tubular cells as the ouabain-displacing compound, is increased in patients with essential hypertension and also demonstrate that plasma levels may be influenced by changes in dietary sodium intake.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE, PATIENTS, AND METHODS: Functional renal reserve in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, as determined by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) response test, is a measure of the capacity of the kidney to increase glomerular filtration in response to the stimulus of a protein meal or amino acid infusion. This 12-month study evaluated the changes in functional renal reserve in eight patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with nephropathy (micro-albuminuria [greater than or equal to 30 micrograms/minute]) who chronically decreased their dietary protein intake to a mean of 0.6 g/kg/day (Group 1) compared with a group of similar patients (n = 7) who maintained their unusual dietary protein intake (1.0 g/kg/day, Group 2). Patients were evaluated and measurements taken at 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Absolute and percent increases in GFR were calculated from three averaged 1-hour measurements after an 80-g protein test meal. RESULTS: Although the initial absolute mean rise (14 +/- 12 versus 18 +/- 13 mL/minute/1.73 m2) in GFR and maximal percent rise (16% +/- 16% versus 32% +/- 27%) after the meal did not differ significantly between the two groups, at 12 months, values in the lower protein group increased (27.8 +/- 9.5 mL/minute/1.73 m2 and 54.7% +/- 48.8%), whereas those in the normal protein intake group declined significantly (3.7 +/- 3.6 mL/min-ute/1.73 m2 and 6.5% +/- 6.5%) (p less than 0.05). Both urine urea and microalbuminuria decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the low protein group. Unstimulated GFR at the end of 12 months was significantly less (p less than 0.05) in Group 2 (47 +/- 2 mL/minute/1.73 m2) than in Group 1 (71 +/- 21 mL/minute/1.73 m2). The rate of decline in GFR was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in the normal protein intake group than in the low protein intake group (0.68 +/- 0.4 versus 0.28 +/- 0.15 mL/minute/1.73 m2/month). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that sustained dietary protein restriction can help to preserve renal function, decrease albuminuria, and lower the baseline GFR while maintaining functional renal reserve in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with predialysis chronic renal failure participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subcutaneously administered erythropoietin. For 12 weeks, patients received either rHuEPO 100 mu/kg body weight three times/week subcutananeously or a placebo. After 12 weeks of placebo, patients now also received rHuEPO in a dose up to 150 mu/kg three times/week until target hematocrit was achieved. Throughout the study, blood pressure was monitored closely and blood work was obtained regularly for hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and iron profile determinations. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, the hematocrit of the treated group had risen from 29% +/- 2% to 35% +/- 2% (p less than 0.001). The placebo group baseline hematocrit was 28% +/- 2% and at 12 weeks 26% +/- 2% After 12 weeks of rHuEPO therapy, the hematocrit of the prior placebo group was 32% +/- 2% (p less than 0.001 versus baseline). No significant change in biochemical parameters was noted. Mean blood pressure values were comparable before and after treatment. All protein ultimately required iron supplementation. In two patients, the rate of progression of renal failure appeared to increase as their hematocrit rose and rHuEPO was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that rHuEPO given subcutaneously is an effective and safe therapy for patients with chronic renal failure who are anemic and who are not receiving dialysis.\r"

Parenteral estrogens have been shown to shorten the prolonged bleeding time in patients with chronic renal failure, although the mechanism of action is unknown. We conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of oral conjugated estrogens in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with renal failure, prolonged bleeding time, and clinical bleeding were given 50 mg of conjugated estrogen (Premarin) daily. RESULTS: Bleeding time normalized in two cases and was reduced to less than 50% of the pretreatment value in one of the remaining two cases. Bleeding stopped in all patients within two days. Ten dialysis patients with prolonged bleeding time were randomized to a course of 50 mg of Premarin daily or placebo. The bleeding time in all five patients in the Premarin group normalized or decreased to below 50% of the pretreatment value after 7.0 +/- 4.2 days of therapy. The bleeding time did not normalize in the five patients treated with placebo. No side effects attributable to therapy were reported.

We report on an outbreak of Streptococcus mitis sepsis in six bone marrow transplant patients receiving oral antimicrobial prophylaxis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an epidemiologic study of all patients in our bone marrow transplant program from 1986 to 1988. The hospital and microbiology records for all patients were reviewed. All bone marrow patients were treated according to specified protocols, including an oral prophylactic antimicrobial regimen that was changed in late 1987 from vancomycin/polymyxin/tobramycin to norfloxacin. Identification, susceptibility testing, and whole cell protein analysis of streptococcal isolates were performed at the Reference and Antimicrobial Investigations Laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control. RESULTS: We detected six cases of S. mitis sepsis among 21 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. No other concurrent pathogen was isolated from any patient at the time of the S. mitis bacteremia. Bacteremia developed within 72 hours of transplant in five of six patients and was associated with severe mucositis in four patients. An environmental study failed to reveal any common source for the outbreak, and whole cell protein analysis of all six S. mitis isolates revealed each to be distinct. Of 12 patients receiving oral vancomycin/polymyxin/tobramycin, one developed S. mitis bacteremia, versus five of nine patients receiving norfloxacin (p less than 0.03). CONCLUSION: We believe S. mitis bacteremia is a potential complication of bone marrow transplantation and is associated with antimicrobial prophylaxis with norfloxacin, especially in the setting of mucositis.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the medical records of 59 patients in whom tuberculous pleuritis was confirmed by histologic findings or mycobacterial culture. Twenty-seven patients (46%) had typical chest roentgenographic findings of reactivation tuberculosis, whereas 32 (54%) had classic tuberculous pleuritis. The clinical and laboratory features of these two groups were compared. RESULTS: Symptoms were more prolonged and pleural fluid glucose and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were more markedly abnormal in patients with reactivation pleuritis than in those with classic pleuritis, suggesting a more chronic inflammatory process in the former group. Compared with patients with classic tuberculous pleuritis, those with reactivation pleuritis had a lower frequency of reactive tuberculin skin tests (61% versus 88%) and granulomatous pleural inflammation (25% versus 72%), but a higher bacillary burden, manifest by a higher frequency of positive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (50% versus 0%) and positive mycobacterial cultures from sputum (60% versus 23%) and pleural fluid (91% versus 66%). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, tuberculous pleuritis was a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis in 46% (27 of 59) of patients. Tuberculous pleuritis is a more chronic process in patients with reactivation disease than in those with classic pleuritis. The lower frequency of reactive tuberculin skin tests and granuloma formation, combined with the higher bacillary burden in patients with reactivation pleuritis, suggest that these patients mount a less effective immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection than do patients with the classic form of tuberculous pleuritis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and ulcer disease as well as in a control population undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected pancreatic or biliary disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients undergoing upper endoscopy at Massachusetts General Hospital were studied over a period of 18 months, as well as 24 patients undergoing ERCP for presumed pancreatic or biliary disease. Two biopsy specimens from the fundus and two from the antrum were taken for microbiologic and histopathologic analysis. Sera were examined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. All specimens were processed in a blind fashion. Chi-square test with Yates' correction was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: H. pylori was found in 31 of 46 (67%) study patients and in six of 24 (25%) control patients (by microbiologic or histologic techniques) (p less than 0.01). H. pylori was found in all patients with peptic ulcer disease and in 60% of patients without ulcers. No association between H. pylori and any specific gastrointestinal symptom was observed. H. pylori was identified in the fundus as often as in the antrum, although in the antrum the organism was more often associated with histologic gastritis. Compared with histology, serologic assays for IgG and IgA antibodies to H. pylori had sensitivities of 100% and 94%, and specificities of 86% and 76%, respectively. Reexamination of selected specimens without knowledge of their identity revealed that the specificity of serology exceeded 94% while the sensitivity of histologic and microbiologic studies may have been closer to 80%. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori was more common in dyspeptic patients than in our control subjects undergoing ERCP. Multiple biopsy sites from fundus and antrum are required to exclude infection. Serologies of IgG and IgA were sensitive and specific for H. pylori, suggesting a possible role for non-endoscopic diagnosis of this infection. The frequent association of H. pylori with active inflammation rather than with quiescent gastritis is consistent with a pathologic role of this organism.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 39 male forestry workers from northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin, areas endemic for blastomycosis but not for histoplasmosis. All subjects were histoplasmin skin test-negative, and none had ever been diagnosed with blastomycosis or pneumonia. An antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation assay was performed to determine the presence of blastomycosis. RESULTS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 12 of 39 subjects demonstrated specific antigen-induced proliferation when stimulated with a purified alkali- and water-soluble antigen derived from the cell wall of Blastomyces dermatitidis. CONCLUSION: The finding that 30% of these men had evidence of previous blastomycosis suggests that subclinical cases do occur sporadically, and are probably more common than diagnosed symptomatic cases. This is similar to histoplasmosis, in which the majority of infections are subclinical. However, the reservoir of persons with previous undiagnosed blastomycosis is probably small compared to the huge number of persons (perhaps 30 million) with prior histoplasmosis.\r"

While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the recent progress in the understanding of clinical and laboratory characterization as well as management of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID). DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search was conducted using Index Medicus, MEDLINE (1962 to 1989), and bibliographies of identified relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: All international comprehensive reviews, reported epidemiologic or immunologic studies, and prospective clinical trials published or abstracted in English were selected. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: A high incidence of lymphoma primarily in the gastro-intestinal tract in Third World countries has stimulated enormous epidemiologic and pathogenetic interests globally. IPSID, with a distinctive biologic marker (alpha heavy chain para-protein), affects the young underprivileged population of those countries. The initially benign-appearing antibiotic-responsive immunoproliferative lesions often evolve to fatal high-grade lymphomas. Roles of environmental and host factors in this evolutionary course are emerging. Recently demonstrated malignant potentials form the early onset of pathogenesis have given a new dimension to the traditional management strategy of IPSID. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic, immunologic, and pathogenetic data that have emerged over the last 25-year study of IPSID have improved our understanding about the complexity of infection-immunity-cancer interrelationships, comparable to those that have arisen from the study of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Early detection and institution of antimicrobial-based treatment regimens with judicious and consistent follow-up can save the lives of many young patients whose manpower is badly needed in Third World countries.\r"

All participants were 17 years of age or less and clinically healthy. Patients were enrolled by the twenty third week of gestation. The mean duration of calcium supplementation or placebo was approximately 14 weeks. Treatment consisted of 2.8 (+/- 1.5) tablets per day in the placebo group (N = 95) and 3.0 (+/- 1.4) tablets per day in the calcium group (N = 94). Dietary calcium intake was similar in both groups at about 1200 mg/day. The calcium group had a lower incidence of preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks; 7.4% vs 21.1%; p = 0.007); spontaneous labor and preterm delivery (6.4% vs 17.9%; p = 0.01); and low birth weight (9.6% vs 21.1%; p = 0.03). This effect was also present after stratified analysis by level of treatment compliance, urinary tract infection, and chlamydial infection. Life-table analysis demonstrated an overall shift to a higher gestational age in the calcium group compared with the placebo group (log-rank test, p = 0.02). As suggested previously, the observed effect could be mediated by a reduction in uterine smooth muscle contractibility. If confirmed by future research, these results could represent an important preventive intervention for prematurity in high-risk populations.\r"

The newborn behavioral assessment scale was administered 3 days after delivery and again 2 weeks after delivery. The Lester newborn behavioral assessment scale summary scores for the group with asphyxia were of the same order as those in the control group. This was also true of the group of newborns with asphyxia with the more severe metabolic acidosis and those with low Apgar scores. These findings support the contention that many newborns who have undergone an intrapartum asphyxial insult will not have evidence of central nervous system injury and that the threshold of central nervous system injury is at the severe end of the spectrum of asphyxia as expressed by a metabolic acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "Both human immunodeficiency virus infections and pelvic inflammatory diseases are sexually acquired illnesses of great consequence to women. This study was undertaken to determine if women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease, in a community endemic for human immunodeficiency virus, were at high risk to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus and if human immunodeficiency virus infections altered their hospital course. One hundred ten women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease in Brooklyn (in a hospital in which 2% of parturients are human immunodeficiency virus seropositive) agreed to human immunodeficiency virus testing; 15 (13.6%) were found to be seropositive. Seropositive women were significantly more likely to have an admission white blood cell count less than 10,000/mm3 (p = 0.001). Human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity was not associated with a higher frequency of other sexually transmitted diseases although there was a trend toward more cases of syphilis among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women. Similarly, although there was no significant difference in rates of operative intervention (26.6% among seropositive and 8.4% among seronegative; p = 0.058), there was a trend toward more surgery among those who were human immunodeficiency virus infected. Women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease, in a community endemic for human immunodeficiency virus, are at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. More research is needed to verify a trend toward more refractory infections among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.\r"

No differences were found before and after treatment in the symptoms of urge incontinence and stress incontinence in the cystometric and urethral pressure profile measurements. Urinary symptoms of frequency, urgency, and nocturia may be caused by the direct pressure exerted on the bladder by the enlarged uterus. Symptoms of urge incontinence and stress incontinence deserve a more specific treatment as they are not related to uterine size.\r"

Continuous graphic records of simultaneous ultrasonographic observations of fetal activities and electronic fetal heart rate tracings of 30 normal term fetuses were examined visually for the occurrence of behavioral state 30 minutes before and after 3 seconds of vibroacoustic stimulation. After vibroacoustic stimulation, the total time spent in state 1 decreased significantly, that spent in state 4 increased significantly, and times spent in state 2 and indeterminate state (no state established for at least 3 minutes) were unchanged. No fetus exhibited state 3 before or after vibroacoustic stimulation. State 4 occurred in 22 fetuses after vibroacoustic stimulation with a duration of at least 30 minutes in four fetuses, and was noted in all fetuses in pre-vibroacoustic stimulation state 1 and 11 of 16 fetuses in pre-vibroacoustic stimulation state 2. Fetal heart rate accelerations occurred within 10 seconds after vibroacoustic stimulation in 94% of the fetuses studied regardless of their prior behavioral state. The variation in the onset and duration of behavioral state responses in most fetuses after vibroacoustic stimulation may depend on previous behavioral state and could be important for interpretation of antenatal assessment that uses this stimulus.\r"

Of these 39 pregnant women, 37 had healthy infants and two patients had miscarriages. None of the fetuses developed hydrops. We propose that pregnant women exposed to B19 parvovirus be tested for evidence of IgG and IgM B19-specific antibodies and that targeted fetal ultrasonography be considered when IgM antibodies are found. Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling and intrauterine transfusion can be considered in cases of B19 parvovirus-associated hydrops and anemia.

The patients were grouped according to severity of hypertension, and the fetal heart rate monitoring, drugs administered, mode of delivery, and neonatal outcome were analyzed. Half of the patients (326) had mild hypertension and 13% (87) had severe hypertension; the remainder (253) had moderate hypertension. There were 49% primiparous and 51% multiparous women. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was made in 76% of cases, and chronic hypertension in 19%. Only 12% of the total were premature by dates, but 47% of this group were among the severe group. Oxytocin was given to 50%, whereas delivery was spontaneous in 56% of cases, and by cesarean section in 22%. This was higher among the severe hypertension group (37%), and the prematurity rate was 47%. Nonstress testing was done in one third of cases and only nonreactivity was associated with neonatal death. Neonatal depression (Apgar score less than 6 at 5 minutes) was significantly associated with intrapartum fixed baseline and late decelerations; these were the best predictors of fetal outcome. The administration of magnesium sulfate, hydralazine, meperidine, or morphine did not predictably affect the fetal heart rate pattern. The perinatal mortality was 21% in the mild group and 36% and 138%, respectively, among moderate and severe cases of hypertension. Close antepartum and intrapartum surveillance, including proper fetal monitoring, should help to reduce risks for mother and fetus through timely intervention.\r"

Each feature was scored 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to poor, adequate, or optimal visualization, and these eight numbers were summed for an overall visualization score. Overall visualization fell abruptly beyond maternal weight 165 pounds (p less than 0.001) and rose with advancing gestational age (p less than 0.001). Placental location did not significantly influence visualization. Overall, an adequate screening scan, defined as adequate visualization of central nervous system, heart, stomach, ventral wall, bladder, and cord was obtained in 51% of scans, and optimal visualization of each of these in only 9% of cases. Factors that might improve anatomic visualization and the implications of these results for the use of ultrasonography in screening for congenital anomalies are discussed.\r"

The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well. This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites.\r"

Eleven (12%) of 80 patients with disease confined to the uterus or positive cytologic findings had CA 125 values greater than 35 U/ml versus 12 (65%) of 20 patients with extrauterine metastasis. Therefore CA 125 values had sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 88%. The TAG 72 level was elevated (greater than 6 U/ml) in 4% of patients with localized disease and 30% with metastasis. CA 15-3 was elevated (greater than 30 U/ml) in 17% and 65% in these categories, respectively. TAG 72 or CA 15-3 levels did not improve the combination of sensitivity and specificity of CA 125 alone. In addition, only one of 10 patients with microscopic metastasis (three cases) or positive peritoneal cytology (seven) had elevation of any of these tumor-associated antigen levels. Failure to detect occult metastasis and a high false-positive rate limit the role of these tumor-associated antigen assays in the preoperative evaluation of patients with endometrial carcinoma.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that reductions in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein may reflect the same phenomena that can also impair normal rates of embryo growth in the presence of poorly compensated maternal diabetes. If so, associations would be expected among maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, embryo rates of growth, and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin reflective of regulation of maternal diabetes during the period of organogenesis. We found maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in 93 pregnant patients with diabetes to be negatively associated with the earliest (4 to 12 weeks) glycosylated hemoglobin determinations. At glycosylated hemoglobin values greater than 9.6% (which approximates the upper quartile), all maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values fell below the median for patients without diabetes (below 0.8 multiple of the median after weight adjustment). Moreover, there was a trend for pregnancies with lower maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and higher glycosylated hemoglobin values to also demonstrate early fetal growth delay as measured by ultrasonography.\r"

We hypothesized that pregnant patients with insulin-dependent diabetes are at an increased risk for infection and that infection is related to poor glycemic control. We matched 65 pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes to 65 nondiabetic pregnant controls. At least one episode of infection before delivery occurred in 83% of the women with insulin-dependent diabetes (26% in control group). The rate of postpartum infection was five times higher in the group with insulin-dependent diabetes and they were susceptible to more kinds of infections. Although there was no overall difference among the indices of glycemic control, hemoglobin A1 obtained before the infection was higher than during infection. We conclude that a high rate of infection exists in pregnant women with diabetes; infection and poor glycemic control may be associated, but it is unclear whether improvement in metabolic control will reduce this high infection rate.\r"

An earlier report showed that a birth weight that results in a fourfold increased risk of stillbirth is not a constant birth weight percentile (2nd percentile at 25 weeks, 17th percentile at 42 weeks). This analysis was applied to 782,430 white and black births in Illinois from 1980 to 1984. Mean and 10th percentile growth for white and black infants is identical before 34 weeks' gestation and growth diverges by 250 gm at term, with white infants being larger. Race-specific birth weights resulting in quadrupling of the stillbirth rate were determined with an exponential regression analysis of the relationship between birth weight and fetal death rate for each gestational age. The data indicate (1) that the birth weights resulting in quadrupling the stillbirth rate are substantially above the Denver 10th percentile and the previously unpublished race-specific Illinois 10th percentiles and (2) that at term white infants demonstrate this constant risk at the 12th percentile, whereas black infants exhibit the risk at the 18th percentile. From these data we conclude that black fetuses are more sensitive than white fetuses to factors that adversely affect growth and that continued use of \"race-neutral\" data for clinical management in racially heterogenous populations will not accurately predict the risk of stillbirth.\r"

Before transfusion, the left and right cardiac outputs were significantly higher than reference ranges for gestation that were constructed from the cross-sectional study of 187 normal pregnancies. After transfusion there was a significant temporary fall in right and left outputs associated with increased ratios between the peak velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active atrial filling. Within 2 hours after transfusion both parameters returned toward the normal range. In addition, no significant changes were found for fetal heart rate values before and after transfusion. The fall of cardiac output was significantly related to the amount of expansion of the feto-placental volume.\r"

Average flow velocity was statistically significantly increased in behavioral state 2F (active sleep) as compared with state 1F (quiet sleep), which was mainly determined by an increase in flow velocity during the end-systolic and passive atrial filling phase. The increase in the average flow velocity at the foramen ovale level during active sleep suggests a redistribution of blood flow at the cardiac level, resulting in an increased right-to-left shunt.\r"

To determine whether physiologic insulin levels play a regulatory role in the androgen status of nonobese women with normal menses, the androgen status of five nonobese normal women was assessed on two occasions: during a control study and after 10 days of oral diazoxide (100 mg, three times daily) administration. Insulin release in response to 100 gm oral glucose administration decreased from 108.0 +/- 28.2 to 49.3 +/- 5.2 nmol.min/L (p = 0.05) after diazoxide administration. However, despite suppression of insulin release, diazoxide administration did not affect serum total testosterone (diazoxide, 0.73 +/- 0.10; control, 0.69 +/- 0.11 nmol/L; p = NS) or sex hormone-binding globulin (diazoxide, 79.7 +/- 16.6; control, 70.2 +/- 12.6 nmol/L; p = NS) concentrations.

Our study of 29 cases of trisomy 21 and 450 control samples shows 80% detection efficiency with maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, the free beta-protein, and maternal age in pregnancies under 17 weeks' gestation. We conclude that the combination of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and the human chorionic gonadotropin free beta-protein will be useful in the prenatal detection of trisomy 21.\r"

Ten patients with breech presentation at term underwent antepartum pelvimetry with magnetic resonance imaging, following by postpartum magnetic resonance pelvimetry and x-ray pelvimetry. Measurements with magnetic resonance imaging are as reliable as those obtained with x-ray pelvimetry and the contrast of the magnetic resonance images is even better. The advantages of magnetic resonance pelvimetry are clear: no ionizing radiation and reliable pelvimetry results in cases of term breech presentation in which a normal pelvis is a prerequisite for safe vaginal delivery.\r"

We found positive amniotic fluid cultures in eight cases (5.09%); however, results of Gram stain examinations were negative in all amniotic fluid samples. The data indicate that there is no correlation between white blood cells in the amniotic fluid and positive amniotic fluid culture results. Only one pregnancy with positive amniotic fluid culture resulted in a septic abortion. Therefore we can suggest that intraamniotic infection can exist early in pregnancy, even with intact membranes, and in most cases without any clinical symptoms.\r"

There were no differences in secondary and tertiary stem villi counts between groups. A significant decrease in small muscular artery counts (p less than 0.01) and total vessel counts (p less than 0.01) was noted in group II. Placental and fetal weights were comparable between groups. This undervascularization may represent placental immaturity as a result of arrested or delayed angiopoiesis. It appears that this abnormality is established before the third trimester and may be enhanced by late vascular obliteration as reported by others. These data substantiate the concept that the structure and function of the placenta is determined to a great degree by fetal karyotype and may help explain the morbidity and mortality seen in these fetuses.\r"

The concentration was higher in the luteal phase than that in the follicular phase, suggesting an association of collagen metabolism with ovarian steroid hormones. Severe salpingo-oophoritis increased the serum level of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen with a decrease to normal during recovery. Elevated values were occasionally seen in endometriosis and leiomyomas.

With the use of a primary monolayer culture of human placental cells at term, the addition of interleukin-1 beta increased the release of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor with a dose- and time-dependent effect. The intracellular concentration of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate increased in the presence of interleukin-1 beta. The addition of indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, partially reversed the effect of interleukin-1 beta. The same doses of interleukin-1 beta stimulated the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone and this effect was partially reversed by the addition of a synthetic corticotropin-releasing factor antagonist or by indomethacin. This study showed that interleukin-1 beta increases the release of corticotropin-releasing factor and adrenocorticotropin hormone from cultured placental cells. This effect is associated with increased intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations and is in part reversed by a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor.\r"

Fetal blood hyperviscosity (n = 7) induced by exchange transfusion with packed maternal blood cells increased placental vascular resistance by greater than or equal to 50% but had no significant effect on the systolic/diastolic ratio. Similarly, maternal hypertension induced by intravenous infusion of angiotensin II to the ewe (n = 9) did not affect the systolic/diastolic ratio despite a 50% increase in maternal arterial blood pressure.

  ".W": "Earlier we showed that because of the presence of functional progesterone receptors, lymphocytes of healthy pregnant women produced an immunomodulatory protein in the presence of progesterone, whereas those of nonpregnant persons did not. Progesterone-treated murine pregnancy lymphocytes release a similar factor. The present study reveals the biologic significance of this finding. Treatment of BALB/c mice that were 8 days pregnant with a progesterone receptor blocker (RU 486) resulted in 100% resorption of the fetuses. Simultaneous administration of the supernatant from progesterone-treated murine pregnancy spleen cells restored the resorption rate to the original 6% observed in untreated control animals. These data suggest that functional lymphocytic progesterone binding sites are needed for the maintenance of normal pregnancy. Because of the blockage of progesterone receptors and the consequent inability of the lymphocytes to produce the progesterone-induced blocking factor, abortion is initiated by immune factors. The fact that administration of the preformed blocking factor counteracted the effect of antiprogesterone treatment suggests that progesterone-mediated immunosuppression is needed for the maintenance of normal gestation.\r"

  ".W": "Southern blot hybridization has been used to identify human papillomavirus types in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases. However, this technique requires fresh-frozen tissue and is incapable of localizing deoxyribonucleic acid sequences to specific cell types in the tumor sample. In contrast, in situ hybridization precisely locates viral sequences within tumor cells while preserving cellular architecture. Further, in situ hybridization requires only small samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Five lymph nodes (from four patients) containing metastatic cervical squamous tumor cells (identified with hematoxylin and eosinophil staining) were analyzed with in situ hybridization techniques with human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid probes labeled with sulfur 35. The primary cervical cancer from all four patients had been shown to contain human papillomavirus type 16 sequences by Southern blot. Three specimens from two patients clearly showed the presence of human papillomavirus type 16 sequences within the nuclei of metastatic tumor cells, whereas two specimens were nondiagnostic most likely as a result of the small volume of cancer relative to the size of the lymph node. This information indicates that it is the tumor cells themselves that contain viral deoxyribonucleic acid and provides additional evidence linking human papillomavirus with cervical carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The differential inhibitory effect of the vasodilators on contractile responses to norepinephrine, serotonin, and potassium on isolated uterine artery ring segments from pregnant ewes within 2 weeks of term was quantified and correlated with the source of Ca++ for the vasoconstrictors producing the smooth muscle contraction. The contraction evoked by the vasoconstrictors was dependent on extracellular Ca++ and in agonist-induced contractions also on an intracellular pool of Ca++. Nifedipine effectively inhibited K(+)-induced (90 mmol/L) contractions (antagonist concentration to reduce the maximum contractile effect to the agonist to 50%, 1.95 +/- 0.9 x 10(-8) mol/L), whereas it was relatively ineffective in blocking norepinephrine-induced (10(-5) mol/L) or serotonin-induced (10(-5) mol/L) vasoconstriction (antagonist concentration to reduce the maximum contractile effect to the agonist to 50%, 1.38 +/- 0.4 x 10(-4) mol/L and 2.04 +/- 0.4 x 10(-5) mol/L, respectively). Methoxyverapamil (D-600) strongly inhibited serotonin-induced contractions (antagonist concentration to reduce the maximum contractile effect to the agonist to 50%, 3.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(-7) mol/L). The phasic rather than the tonic components of the serotonin- and norepinephrine-induced contractions were more effectively inhibited by D-600 (p less than 0.05). Sodium nitroprusside preferentially blocked (p less than 0.05) the sustained tonic components of norepinephrine- and serotonin-induced vasoconstrictions (antagonist concentration to reduce the maximum contractile effect to the agonist to 50%, 7.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(-7) mol/L and 8.2 +/- 0.6 x 10(-7) mol/L, respectively). On the basis of these findings it is concluded that D-600 and sodium nitroprusside are more effective than nifedipine in blocking contractile responses due to receptor stimulation, and therefore might be more effective in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in which these amines might be implicated.\r"

To investigate placental transfer and fetal effects of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, CGS13080 (Ciba-Geigy, Summit, N.J.) was intravenously infused into eight singleton- or twin-bearing ewes near term. During CGS 13080 infusion (0.1 mg/kg/hr), maternal steady-state CGS 13080 levels of 102 +/- 18 ng/ml were achieved within 30 minutes and maternal serum thromboxane generation decreased significantly (13 +/- 3 to 4 +/- 1 ng/ml). However, fetal serum levels of CGS 13080 were only 4% of peak maternal concentrations and fetal serum thromboxane generation did not change. There was no evidence of change in uterine blood flow, maternal or fetal blood pressure, heart rate, blood gas values, or fetal or maternal metabolites of prostacyclin or prostaglandin E2 during the study. We speculate that CGS 13080 may be efficacious in the treatment of human pregnancy-induced hypertension.\r"

Further we studied the in vitro effects of long-term insulin exposure on cultured rabbit neuronal cell insulin receptors. Long-term glucose infusions to maternal rats resulted in maternal and fetal hyperglycemia and mild hyperinsulinemia, which decreases the liver insulin receptor abundance of the mother but increased that of the fetus. Streptozotocin-induced maternal diabetes resulted in maternal and fetal hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia (or near-normal insulin levels) and increased maternal and fetal liver insulin receptors. The maternal and fetal brain insulin receptor abundance failed to change at high or low insulin concentrations. Similarly long-term insulin (5 micrograms/ml) exposure failed to alter cultured neuronal cell insulin receptors as well. We conclude that perturbations in maternal and fetal circulating insulin concentrations fail to affect the brain insulin receptors. This protective phenomenon may be critical in maintaining the normal neuronal energy balance and functioning during certain disease states such as diabetes mellitus and hyperinsulinism.\r"

Therefore prostaglandins might alter the distribution of umbilical venous return between the ductus venosus and liver. We have examined the effect of indomethacin and prostaglandin E1 on the vascular resistance of the umbilical-placental circulation, ductus venosus, and liver in 14 chronically instrumented fetal lambs. We found that indomethacin caused a nearly twofold increase in the vascular resistance of both the ductus venosus and liver. Prostaglandin E1, administered 70 minutes after indomethacin at a dose of 0.41 +/- 0.09 (SEM) micrograms/min per kilogram of fetal weight, decreased umbilical-placental blood flow, increased the vascular resistance of the umbilical arteries and placenta, and reversed the elevation of the vascular resistances of the ductus venosus and liver. Because both indomethacin and prostaglandin E1 affected the resistances of the ductus venosus and liver to the same extent, it is unlikely that prostaglandins of the E series mediate the change in distribution of umbilical venous return between the ductus venosus and liver during fetal stress.\r"

Nonetheless, concern continues to be expressed about the effects of early age at first use, long-term duration of use, formulation, and a variety of other factors thought to influence breast cancer risk in the presence of oral contraception. A number of recent studies restricted to young women suggest that long-term use may increase the risk of disease occurring very early, but the present lack of consistent findings in well-conducted epidemiologic studies prevents any certain conclusion with regard to cause-and-effect. However, if an increased risk were indeed present, the most plausible interpretation is that long-term oral contraception promotes earlier clinical manifestation of breast cancer in some women while having no net impact on their lifetime risk of the disease.\r"

The first study compared a vaginal ring containing levonorgestrel and estradiol with an oral contraceptive containing norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. A second study compared two oral combinations: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate-ethinyl estradiol. As predicted, use of all the contraceptives led to lowering of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, contrary to what might be expected, use of the ethinyl estradiol-containing oral contraceptives did not lead to an increase in the prevalence or extent of atherosclerosis. We concluded that ethinyl estradiol neutralized the atherogenic influence of the progestin component of oral contraceptives.\r"

Now that the preparation has been introduced in several countries, the opportunity to assemble comprehensive experience has been taken by initiating phase IV studies. Documentation on 600,000 therapy cycles with monophasic gestodene among 100,000 women is already available. The drop-out rate was low. A large number of women participated in the clinical studies for a long time--some up to 3 years. Study results showed that contraceptive reliability was high and cycle control was excellent. The gestodene combination was well tolerated. The frequency of concomitant symptoms was low. The monophasic gestodene meets the basic criteria essential for an oral contraceptive.\r"

Baseline values in the two groups were in good agreement. During the first three cycles, serum cholesterol levels remained unchanged, but triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased significantly and to the same extent (about 20%). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased slightly. Apolipoproteins A1 and A2 and low-density lipoprotein B increased significantly and similarly. Except for continued increases in low-density lipoprotein B, no further changes were noted during subsequent cycles. We concluded that the two contraceptives have the same impact on lipid metabolism, with all lipid and apolipoprotein values remaining within the normal range. The changes with both pills reflect a mild estrogenic dominance. Implications for coronary artery atherosclerosis appear to be minimal.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetic and protein-binding properties of gestodene and ethinyl estradiol have been investigated after single and multiple dosing in several studies in 83 healthy, young women. After oral administration, gestodene is completely absorbed and bioavailable and exhibits dose-linear pharmacokinetics. During long-term pill use, serum levels of gestodene were four to five times higher than after single administration, showing a periodic increase from day 1 to day 10 during each cycle. Ultrafiltration studies revealed that 75.3% of total serum gestodene is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, 24.1% is bound to albumin, and only 0.6% is not protein bound. Thus gestodene levels during steady state are explained by an increase in sex hormone binding-globulin as a result of concomitant administered ethinyl estradiol and a specific binding of gestodene to this protein. Serum levels of ethinyl estradiol during single and multiple administration were identical and were not different from those observed with another preparation containing 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol.\r"

The retinitis in these patients was characterized by primary involvement of the outer retina, with sparing of the inner retina and retinal vasculature until late in the disease process; a rapidly progressive course; poor response to intravenous acyclovir; and development of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. In one of the patients, the retinitis was initially multifocal. Electron microscopy of a retinal biopsy specimen from one of the patients demonstrated virus particles consistent with a herpesvirus, and polymerase chain reaction disclosed herpesvirus in a retinal biopsy specimen of the other patient. This entity may represent a distinct form of acute retinal necrosis that is seen in immunocompromised individuals.\r"

We treated two patients with Crohn's disease who manifested retinal vascular disease that may have been related to the immune nature of the underlying disease or possibly to changes in the vasculature or coagulation system. One patient had a central retinal vein occlusion and the other had retinal vasculitis involving retinal arteries and veins with an apparent branch retinal artery occlusion. Both patients were in excellent health except for Crohn's disease, which was confirmed by a biopsy specimen. In one patient, the diagnosis of retinal vasculitis preceded the clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease, whereas for the second patient the symptomatology of the intestinal disease preceded the ocular manifestations. We suggest that inflammatory bowel disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinal vascular occlusive disease, especially in a young patient.\r"

A three-port trans-pars plana vitrectomy was performed in conjunction with retinotomy, tumor biopsy, endophotocoagulation, and air-fluid exchange. Vitrectomy was used to decrease the amount of traction secondary to retained vitreous after intraocular surgery. Retinotomy sites were chosen under microscopic control to avoid large caliber retinal vessels. Then a modified tumor-aspiration technique, together with endophotocoagulation and aspiration of intraoperative vitreous hemorrhages, provided an opportunity to sample tumor tissue continually at varied depths. We have added standard vitreous surgery concepts, techniques, and instrumentation to produce vitrectomy retinotomy aspiration biopsy of choroidal tumors.\r"

Ultrasonography through silicone oil is subject to significant imaging artifacts. We performed magnetic resonance imaging on six patients with unilateral intravitreal silicone oil to determine if the technique would detect detached retina and subretinal oil. All patients had undergone pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection for proliferative vitreoretinopathy; five patients had encircling solid silicone scleral buckles. In five patients the media were clear, and ophthalmoscopic findings were correlated with magnetic resonance findings. Four patients had recurrence of inferior retinal detachment; magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated subretinal oil in three of these patients. One patient had a concentric, shallow, anterior retinal detachment; magnetic resonance scanning demonstrated a globular hyperintensity suggestive of subretinal oil. In the sixth patient, who had an opaque cornea, magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the retina was attached preoperatively; this was confirmed at subsequent surgery. A chemical shift artifact was helpful in defining the contour of retinal detachments and the presence of subretinal oil by outlining the silicone oil within the eye.\r"

Histopathologic examinations disclosed no evidence of erosion of sclera or conjunctiva of the eye by the glaucoma implant device. In the outer layers of the bleb wall, few and mostly degenerated inflammatory cells were present, which represented a minimal inflammatory reaction. Scanning electron microscopy of the tubes in these three patients showed that the tube was intact, patent, and without signs of degradation. The tube entering into the anterior chamber caused no appreciable inflammation and maintained its patency even when downgrowth epithelial cells lined the anterior chamber. The Molteno plate induced little or no inflammatory reaction. Therefore, the Molteno glaucoma implant is a useful device for patients with high risk for failure after surgery for glaucoma.\r"

Tumors were characterized by ultrasonically measured dimensions and power spectrum analysis, which provided information not available in conventional A- or B-scan ultrasonography. Histopathologic features, including cell clustering pattern, cell type, pigmentation, vascularity, and necrosis, were quantified. Statistically significant correlations were found between parameters derived from the power spectrum and histologic characteristics. Patients were followed up for up to ten years with 14 deaths occurring because of metastases. Using a Cox relative risk model with histopathologic data, a risk model comprising pigmentation and cell type (P less than .0001) was obtained. Using ultrasonic characteristics, a model comprising tumor volume and scatterer concentration (P = .0062) was obtained. The results suggest that ultrasonic tissue characterization and three-dimensional biometry may provide improved in vivo prognostic indicators for uveal melanoma.\r"

Six of seven patients were cured of Acanthamoeba keratitis with medical therapy alone, one patient required therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty to eradicate the infection. Two patients underwent penetrating keratoplasty to improve their vision after medical therapy. Our series differs from previous reports in that triple antiamoebic therapy was used in all seven patients and was successful in both early and advanced cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Prolonged and intensive topical therapy with these three antiamoebic drugs may be an effective mode of therapy for Acanthamoeba keratitis.\r"

Most of the patients were young males whose average age was 35 years. Common tools accounted for many injuries (14 of 41, 34%). Sixteen injuries (39%) were work-related. Thirty-six patients (88%) had corneal scars from a perforating injury, four patients (10%) had corneal edema, and one patient (2%) required emergency penetrating keratoplasty for extensive tissue loss. Of the 39 patients with one year of follow-up, 31 (82%) maintained clear corneal grafts. Rejection occurred in nine of 39 patients (23%) and only three (33%) of the rejections resolved. Visual outcome was favorable with 20 patients (51%) attaining best-corrected postoperative visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/40, nine patients (23%) attaining visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/100, and ten patients (26%) attaining visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Preoperative retinal disease (six of 39, 15%), astigmatic errors (five of 39, 13%), graft failures (four of 39, 10%), and postoperative glaucoma (12 of 39, 31%) adversely influenced the outcome. Although the prevalence of postoperative complications is relatively high, good visual results can be obtained in patients who undergo penetrating keratoplasty after ocular trauma.\r"

Baseline and follow-up serum vitamin A levels were obtained. Of the 45 children receiving vitamin A, 33 (73.3%) showed complete cure and disappearance of Bitot's spots, six (13.3%) had disappearance of some but not all Bitot's spots, and six (13.3%) were unresponsive to treatment. The nonresponsive children were older, all male, and had higher initial mean serum vitamin A levels, 23.0 micrograms/dl, compared to 15.9 micrograms/dl in the cured group (P = .017). These data suggest that normal vitamin A status may be found in approximately 13% of children with Bitot's spots before vitamin A intervention and that one fourth of those who had Bitot's spots originally will not be cured of all Bitot's spots after intervention. These are important factors to consider when using Bitot's spots in prevalence surveys as a clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency.\r"

Expression of PN-1 was also abundant in astroglial processes in the parenchyma and in perivascular astroglial endfeet of human cerebral cortex. In situ hybridization with an 35S-labeled RNA antisense probe for PN-1 resulted in significant labeling of astrocytes and blood vessels. Because thrombin is known to cause retraction of neurites and modification of astrocytic morphology at low concentrations, PN-1 around blood vessels may play a major protective role against extravasation of thrombin and possibly other serine protease into the human brain.\r"

To determine whether EGF is taken up by platelets, platelets for EGF receptors were assayed and it was attempted to detect uptake of EGF by the platelets from culture medium. Platelets were found to lack EGF receptors, and no uptake of EGF from the culture medium was detected. To assess whether EGF is packaged into platelets from the megakaryocyte, megakaryocytes in frozen section bone marrow cores were stained for EGF protein by immunohistochemistry, and it was demonstrated that EGF is present in megakaryocytes. In addition, staining of megakaryocytes by in situ hybridization for EGF mRNA demonstrated its presence in these cells. Therefore it is concluded that the source of EGF in human platelets is the megakaryocyte and that this EGF is synthesized in the megakaryocyte rather than being taken up from its environment.\r"

Medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) were separated and studied by enzymatic digestion of the vessel wall. mRNA levels of c-fos and c-jun from aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) were simultaneously induced within 30 minutes of BDE and declined to baseline by 1.5 hours, c-myc mRNA did not begin to increase until 1 hour after vascular injury. Levels of c-myc peaked at 2 hours and were sustained for an additional 4 hours before gradually declining. Smooth muscle cells derived from enzyme-treated control aortae that did not undergo BDE expressed c-fos and c-jun, but showed no evidence of c-myc message. In contrast, nonenzymatically treated, non-BDE whole aortae (containing both media and adventitia) demonstrated a prominent c-myc signal, but failed to express c-fos and c-jun. Corresponding examination of adventitia derived from enzyme-treated aortae showed this tissue to be a source of all three proto-oncogenes. The results of this study demonstrate the earliest in vivo molecular markers of vascular injury reported to date and implicate SMC proto-oncogene expression in the initiation of SMC proliferation. Furthermore these findings suggest two avenues for proto-oncogene induction, that are due to (1) vessel wall manipulation and (2) humoral stimulation.\r"

The RT6-depleted DR rat provides a good model for the in situ study of insulitis. The authors used the anti-RT6.1 monoclonal antibody to selectively deplete RT6 T cells in DR rats and produce a synchronous and rapid development of insulitis that commences 10 days after treatment. The phenotype of cells that infiltrated the islets at different stages of insulitis in the RT6-depleted DR rat was determined by immunocytochemical techniques. A prodromal period of 10 days was present in which the authors could not detect morphologic alterations within the pancreas. This is followed by a second phase of early insulitis in which a few islets are infiltrated by macrophages and T cells. This rapidly progresses by 18 days to the final phase of generalized insulitis in which the islets are massively infiltrated by macrophages and T cells.\r"

Using flow cytometry, a complete mitotic blockade was demonstrated after 16 hours with 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l (molar) colchicine. Colchicine-induced changes were reversible when equimolar antibody was added simultaneously with or up to 6 hours after colchicine. With further delay in addition of antibody, a progressive irreversible increase in mitotic blockade and increase in mean cell size was observed. Prolonged colchicine exposure, without antibody reversal, led to polyploidy and structural chromosome breakage. Early antibody reversal restored cells to the diploid state, whereas delayed reversal resulted in a time-dependent increase in polyploidy. Colchicine-induced polyploidy and chromosomal aberrations may be the basis for both colchicine toxicity and the time-dependent increase in irreversibility of colchicine effects.\r"

  ".W": "Light microscopic immunohistochemical studies were performed to evaluate the distribution of fibronectin in paraffin sections of p-formaldehyde-fixed normal rat hearts and the hearts of rats that had undergone ligation of the left coronary artery. A peroxidase-labeled antibody technique was used, together with appropriate immunohistochemical control procedures, for the localization of fibronectin in normal hearts and in the hearts of sham-operated animals. Fibronectin was localized in the interstitial space between myocytes, and beneath arterial, venous, and capillary endothelium. At 4 hours after coronary ligation, fibronectin was localized in a patchy fashion in the cytoplasm and interstitial space of some of the myocytes in the area supplied by the ligated vessel. At 24 hours, there was more intense, homogeneous staining in necrotic myocytes in the infarcted area and in the capillary endothelium in the border zone. At 48 hours, the intensity of staining for fibronectin was maximal in and between the necrotic myocytes in the center of the infarct and in proliferating and migrating capillaries and fibroblasts in the border zone. Similar patterns of localization were observed at 3 and 7 days after coronary ligation, but with progressive decreases in the intensity of staining. Two sources of fibronectin appeared to have contributed to these changes: plasma fibronectin diffusing through damaged blood vessels would account for the early staining observed in necrotic myocytes in the center of the infarct, whereas de novo synthesis of fibronectin by connective tissue cells and endothelial cells in sprouting capillaries would be responsible for the subsequent staining observed in viable capillaries in the border zone of the infarct. Known properties of fibronectin in vitro, combined with these in vivo observations, indicate that fibronectin may influence the thrombotic, inflammatory, angiogenic, and fibrotic processes involved in infarct healing.\r"

  ".W": "The authors describe the histopathologic evolution of Lyme disease in severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) and normal C.B-17 and C57BL/6 mice inoculated with Borrelia burgdorferi. Starting on day 7 after inoculation, all scid mice infected subcutaneously in the tail with a low-passage European tick isolate of B. burgdorferi had clinical evidence of arthritis characterized by reddening and swelling of tibiotarsal joints. Later on, other joints, ie, metatarsal and ulnacarpal joints were also affected. The infection of scid mice resulted in a persistent spirochetemia and the development of a multisystem disease with chronic progressive inflammation of joints, heart, and liver. Major histopathologic alterations included 1) severe joint lesions, characterized by the presence of hyperplastic inflamed synovial lining cells associated with the erosion and destruction of cartilage and/or bone; 2) pancarditis with infiltrations of mononuclear cells in the endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium; and 3) hepatitis with mononuclear cell infiltrations confined to the portal field and central vein, granulomatous reactions, and eventually the development of liver fibrosis. In addition, smaller more confined lesions were found in kidneys, lung, brain, and striated muscle. The inflammatory infiltrates in the various organs were associated mostly with Mac-1+ cells, largely monocytes and macrophages, as well as some polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but not B and T lymphocytes. Infective spirochetes could be readily isolated from blood and joints and were found at the site of inoculum and the myocardium. In contrast, subcutaneous inoculation of normal C.B-17 or C57BL/6 mice with spirochetes in general did not result in clinical signs of arthritis. Only 10% to 20% of the C57BL/6 mice, but none of the C.B-17 mice, showed clinical evidence of oligoarthritis, which appeared not before day 36 after inoculation. In general, the infection of normal mice resulted in minimal lesions in various organs, and no spirochetes could be visualized or reisolated from their tissues. The data demonstrate that Lyme borreliosis may develop in mice in the absence of detectable specific B and T cells and thus suggest an immunologic control of the disease in this species. The scid mouse model therefore can be used to define the components of the immune system responsible for the suppression and/or the progression of the disease.\r"

Mast cell density in intrapulmonary airways was measured in outbred CD (Crl:CDBR) rats by use of morphometric techniques at 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after viral or sham inoculation. Density of bronchiolar mast cells was higher in virus-inoculated rats than in control rats at 30, 60, and 90 days after inoculation (P less than 0.01), but not at 7 or 15 days after inoculation. Total pulmonary mast cell numbers were increased in virus-inoculated rats at 30 days after inoculation. Rats at 42 days after viral inoculation had over a threefold increase in sensitivity to the concentration of nebulized metbacholine that would stimulate a 50% increase in respiratory resistance. Virus-inoculated rats sensitized to ovalbumin had over a 10-fold increase (P less than 0.02) in pulmonary neutrophils that were recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage at 4 hours after ovalbumin aerosol challenge. Virus-inoculated rats at this time also had higher densities of neutrophils in bronchiolar walls than allergen-exposed control rats. The results indicate that Sendai virus induces increases in numbers of bronchiolar mast cells at times from 30 to 90 days after inoculation, and that mast cell increases are associated with airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and heightened allergic airway inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Sparse (75 to 2000 cells/cm2) density cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells uniformly undergo terminal squamous differentiation when incubated in medium containing serum (fetal bovine serum [FBS]) or transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1). It was found that the cell density of the culture affects the probability that a cell will respond to these differentiation-inducing agents. Thus whereas irreversible inhibition of DNA synthesis occurs in sparse cell-density cultures within 24 hours after exposure, only a transient (less than 36 hours) depression in DNA synthesis was seen in high (more than 10,000 cells/cm2) density cultures. In addition, although phase microscopic image analysis revealed that virtually all of the cells displayed a squamous morphology within 1 hour after exposure to FBS or TGF-beta 1, observations made 48 to 72 hours later showed the presence of clusters of small prolate spheroid-shaped cells surrounded by many involucrin-positive squamous-appearing cells. Only the small cells were capable of DNA synthesis and cell division as determined by autoradiography and time-lapse photomicrographic images. These replicating cells immediately undergo squamous differentiation if they are subcultured and reinoculated at low cell density and incubated in medium supplemented with FBS or TGF-beta 1. Therefore the probability that a human bronchial epithelial cell will be refractive to FBS- or TGF-beta 1 induced terminal squamous differentiation is solely a function of the cell density of the culture.\r"

  ".W": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a family of isoenzymes that play an important role in protecting cells from cytotoxic and carcinogenic agents, can be separated by biochemical and immunologic characteristics into three distinct classes named alpha, mu, and pi. Previous studies have indicated that there is marked heterogeneity in the expression of different GST isoenzymes in different normal and malignant tissues. To better understand the regulation of the human pi class glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme (GST-pi), the tissue distribution of this protein wa studied by an immunohistochemical technique using an anti-GST-pi polyclonal antibody in normal paraffin-embedded human tissues. These studies indicate that there is a broad distribution of GST-pi in normal human tissues and establish a precise localization within the different organs studied. GST-pi was expressed predominantly in normal epithelial cells of the urinary, digestive, and respiratory tracts, suggesting a possible role for GST-pi in detoxication and elimination of toxic substances. Previous studies have indicated that GST-pi and the putative drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein are both overexpressed in multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cells and in xenobiotic resistant preneoplastic rat hyperplastic liver nodules. Results from this study indicate that there are also similarities between the normal tissue distribution GST-pi and that previously reported for mammalian P-glycoprotein, particularly in secretory epithelia. This finding suggests that these two gene products, which have been implicated in the development of resistance to cytotoxic drugs, may be coregulated in normal and malignant cells.\r"

Our recent study of the tissue distribution of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, a cell-surface collagen receptor, revealed that high levels of receptor expression were associated with orderly, regulated epithelial cell proliferation. Those observations prompted the present investigation of alpha 2 beta 1 and other integrins in adenocarcinoma of the breast. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was highly expressed on the epithelium of the ducts and ductules of normal breast tissue. Normal or nearly normal levels of the receptor were expressed in fibroadenomas. In contrast, markedly decreased or undetectable alpha 2 beta 1 expression was typical of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Well-differentiated lesions exhibited intermediate levels of expression. Similar, but less extensive, decreases in expression were observed for the alpha 5 beta 1 (fibronectin receptor) and alpha v beta 3 (vitronectin receptor). Significant expression of the beta 1 subunit on even poorly differentiated tumors suggests that the expression of other undefined members of the beta 1 family is not reduced to the same low level as alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1. Expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was highly correlated with estrogen-receptor expression. Decreased expression of alpha 2 beta 1 and other integrin adhesive protein receptors probably contributes to the altered adhesive properties of tumor cells characteristic of the malignant phenotype.\r"

The infiltrate in these vessels was characterized using immunohistochemical stains for lymphocytes (CD45), macrophages (MAC-387), T lymphocytes (CD45RO), B lymphocytes (L-26), and smooth muscle cells (actin). In addition, a full panel of monoclonal antibodies was used on the fresh-frozen tissue available from one of the two explanted hearts. Ten of the eleven recipients with accelerated arteriosclerosis had a moderate to marked lymphocytic endothelialitis compared to 3 of 14 without transplant-related arteriosclerosis (P less than 0.005). Immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin-embedded material demonstrated that most of the lymphocytes in the subendothelial space of these vessels were T lymphocytes and that this infiltrate was associated with an accumulation of macrophages and a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the intima. In the explanted heart from which fresh-frozen tissue was available for more detailed cell typing, the T cells marked predominantly as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+, CD2+). These results suggest that accelerated arteriosclerosis may be mediated, in part, by a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-directed endothelialitis.\r"

In this study, CdCl2 solutions were instilled through a lobar bronchus into the left lung of the rat. Two doses (400 micrograms or 50 micrograms of CdCl2, each in 400 microliters of neutral saline) were used and the morphologic changes occurring during the first 7 days after a single exposure were documented by light and electron microscopy. With the higher dose, inflammatory cells appeared in the alveolar interstitium 1 day after CdCl2 administration. Edema and thickening of the alveolar walls were evident, as were damaged type I epithelial cells and denuded basement membranes. Fibrin was found in the air spaces. Within 2 days, inflammatory cells were seen in large numbers and fibroblasts were observed passing through gaps in the alveolar basement membranes into the air spaces. By 4 and 7 days after CdCl2, various forms of intraluminal fibrosis, including intrabronchiolar budding, mural incorporation, and obliterative changes, were observed. The contralateral lungs had normal-appearing architecture for all the time points investigated. In the lower dose exposure, gradients of alveolar damage were observed in which normal lung, interstitial fibrosis, and/or intraluminal fibrosis were seen within treated lungs. In the mildly damaged regions, interstitial fibrosis predominated, while in the more severely damaged regions, mural incorporation of the convoluted basement membranes was observed. The pulmonary fibrosis that developed appeared to be similar to some human interstitial lung diseases and may offer a system in which to study the regulation of collagen deposition and fibrosis development in these pathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The authors tested frozen sections from 28 renal cell carcinomas (RCC)--21 clear, 1 eosinophilic, 4 basophilic, and 2 spindle-shaped cell type--with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) reacting against cytokeratin, vimentin, CD24, CALLA/CD10, villin, CD26, and HLA class I and class II molecules. These molecules are markers of specific segments of the mature kidney, and their loss or acquisition reflects the different steps of human nephrogenesis. KI67 MAb was used to evaluate cell-proliferating activity. All RCC cases expressed cytokeratin. Coexpression of vimentin was observed in 21 of 28 cases. Whether of clear or chromophilic type, all tumoral cells strongly expressed CD24 molecule, present on primitive blastema cells. All clear-type RCCs expressed CALLA/CD10 and 60% were also villin positive; some were faintly positive for CD26. CALLA, villin, and CD26 were not detected in basophilic cell type. HLA class I molecules were variably expressed in almost all cases, but HLA class II were never detected on tumoral cells. Except for the spindle-shaped population, cell-proliferating activity was low. These results favor the hypothesis that RCCs derive from cells that have 'recovered' the different options of metanephric differentiation. Clear cells show evidence of maturation toward proximal type, while basophilic cells do not. It would be of interest to evaluate the usefulness of serum measurements of villin and/or CALLA as markers in clear cell-type RCC.\r"

  ".W": "The antigens recognized by seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against rat glomerular proteins were localized, and the sites of binding of the MAbs after in vivo injection were determined by immunoelectron microscopy. The antigens were localized in situ by immunoperoxidase and immunogold labeling to different domains and microdomains of the glomerular endothelium and epithelium. 23A recognized an antigen expressed exclusively on the luminal (apical) domain of the endothelium. 5A (anti-podocalyxin) and 26C (anti-DPPIV) recognized antigens expressed on the apical domains of both the endothelium and podocytes. 13A, 14A, 20B (anti-gp330), and 27A recognized antigens restricted to podocytes in the glomerulus. The 13A antigen was present on their basal surface and the 27A and 14A antigens were expressed on both their apical and basal domains. The 14A antigen also was associated with the filtration slit membranes. All these MAbS bound to their antigens after injection in vivo. Those that recognize endothelial antigens were rapidly cleared from the circulation and rapidly disappeared from glomeruli, whereas those that recognize epithelial antigens persisted in the circulation and were detectable in glomeruli for hours or days. The sites of binding of the MAbs differed: 23A and 5A IgG (antipodocalyxin) bound exclusively to the luminal domain of the endothelium, whereas 26C IgG (anti-DPPIV) bound to both the luminal endothelial membrane and the apical and basal domains of podocytes. The MAbs that recognize podocyte antigens bound to different domains of the podocyte plasmalemma: 13A and 27A IgGs to the basal domain, 14A to the slit membranes, and 20B to coated pits on the entire plasma membrane. 27A IgG led to the formation of small subepithelial immune deposits that remained up to 10 days. It is concluded that 1) glomerular membrane proteins vary considerably in their distribution among plasmalemmal domains and microdomains of endothelial and epithelial cells; 2) virtually all structures in the glomerulus and all domains and micro-domains of the endothelium and podocyte are accessible to circulating antibodies; and 3) the fate of immune complexes formed by binding to glomerular components varies with the location of the antigen within the glomerulus, with those that bind to the basal domain and slit membranes of the podocyte persisting longer than the others.\r"

Triton X-114 extracts of isolated glomeruli were subjected to phase separation, and the resultant detergent and aqueous phases were used to immunize mice. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by standard techniques, and hybridomas secreting antibodies (IgGs) that recognize glomerular cell surface antigens were selected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and indirect immunofluorescence. The IgGs of 13 MAbs selected for study recognized antigens of different molecular weights (45-350 kd) by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and had different distributions in the glomerulus and in other renal structures by immunofluorescence. Several proved to recognize known antigens--ie, podocalyxin (MAbs 1A, 5A, 11A, and 20A), gp330 (20B), and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (26C). Others recognized antigens not previously characterized that fell into four groups: 1) those that were detected mainly in glomeruli; 2) those present in both glomeruli and peritubular capillaries; 3) those present in both glomeruli and tubule epithelia; and 4) those detected in all these sites. The pattern of glomerular staining also varied, but most of the antigens appeared to be expressed on either the endothelium or the epithelium, or on both. 27A IgG was specific for podocytes and weakly precipitated a 103-kd protein. 7A and 13A IgG precipitated a 120-kd protein and stained glomeruli as well as the basal aspects of distal tubules. 23A IgG recognized a more-than 350-kd antigen that appeared to be specific for endothelial cells in rat kidney and in all other organs studied. 14A IgG precipitated a 150-kd protein and stained glomeruli, proximal tubule brush borders, and endothelial and epithelial cells in rat kidney and in several other organs. 4B and 9B IgG gave a granular cytoplasmic staining in all cells. When injected intravenously into rats, all of the MAbs except 4B and 9B rapidly bound to glomeruli, demonstrating that the respective antigens are exposed at the cell surface and represent potential targets for antibody-mediated immune injury. It is concluded that selective detergent extraction of glomeruli is a useful approach for generation of antibodies that recognize native, nondenatured membrane components of glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells.\r"

Rabbits were fed one of two diets for a period of 30 days: a nonatherogenic diet with corn oil as the sole fat source, or an atherogenic diet containing beef tallow and cholesterol. In addition, animals received a daily supplement of either MaxEPA fish oil or corn oil (0.5 ml/kg body weight). Terminal blood samples were drawn and the cholesterol and triglyceride levels determined for both plasma and very low-density (VLDL), intermediate-density (IDL), low-density (LDL), and high-density (HDL) lipoproteins. Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substance (TBARS), an indicator of lipid peroxidation, was measured in the plasma samples. Besides these biochemical parameters of atherogenesis, the number of intimal foam cells in the descending thoracic aorta of each animal was determined by microscopic examination of the vessels en face. In rabbits fed the nonatherogenic diet, fish oil supplementation did not significantly affect any of the biochemical parameters that were measured. In contrast, fish oil supplementation of the atherogenic diet led to a significant increase in the LDL- and HDL-cholesterol as well as the HDL-triglyceride levels. Plasma TBARS also increased more than four times. Morphologic analysis of the vessels from rabbits fed the atherogenic diet indicated that fish oil supplementation led to a threefold increase in the number of intimal foam cells, a result that may be linked to increases in both LDL-cholesterol and plasma TBARS. The results of these experiments do not support the hypothesis that dietary fish oil will inhibit the initiation or progression of lesion formation in the cholesterol-fed rabbit.\r"

  ".W": "The Lukes/Collins classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas subdivides follicular center cell (FCC) lymphomas into four categories based on nuclear size, shape, and state of transformation. Because of the well-recognized difficulty in making these subdivisions in routine histologic sections, a morphometric analysis of typical small cleaved (SC), large cleaved (LC), small noncleaved (SNC), and large noncleaved (LNC) FCCs was performed to describe and compare these four categories using objective parameters. The following features, which had been previously tested on normal follicles, were measured and calculated: nuclear area (NA), nuclear contour index of ellipticity (NCIe), nuclear contour index of nuclear irregularity (NCIni), and a relative chromatin dispersal index (CDI). The presence of nucleoli also was recorded. Mean values for the NA, NCIe, NCIni, and CDI were significantly different among all four FCC lymphoma subtypes, except that the CDI, which reflects transformation, was similar for the SC and LC cell groups. Comparison using the proportion of cells with nucleoli in each case revealed significant differences between all but the SNC and LNC groups. The LC group had the highest mean nuclear ellipticity and nuclear irregularity values. Mean nuclear area was smallest for the SC group followed by the LC, SNC, and LNC groups. Despite these many differences, all parameters showed a broad spectrum of values when either mean values for individual cases of each FCC subtype or distribution curves for all cells within a certain subtype were compared. This morphometric data demonstrates that the four histologically recognized types of FCC lymphomas are distinctive using a more analytic technique. This study also provides further insight into the differences among them. Evidence of nuclear transformation (nuclear size, chromatin dispersal, and frequent nucleoli) is a more important criterion than nuclear contours in distinguishing LNC from LC lymphomas. Although LC lymphomas have some features intermediate between SC and the noncleaved FCC lymphomas, they more closely resemble SC lymphomas. Finally morphometric analyses such as these provide an objective morphologic foundation for future prospective investigations of transformation-related phenomena; these studies may facilitate comparison of morphologic data with immunophenotype and genotype in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and comparison of various other B-cell neoplasms with follicular center cell neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Retarded growth and disordered glucose metabolism secondary to growth hormone (GH) deficiency are associated with persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of GH-producing cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Infected C3H/ST mice, which are H-2k haplotype, become GH deficient, and LCMV replicates in most (more than 90%) of their GH-producing cells. In contrast, BALB/WEHI and SWR/J mice, which are H-2d and H-2q, respectively, do not develop this GH deficiency, and less than 20% of their GH-producing cells are infected by virus. Yet all three strains infected at birth with LCMV strain Armstrong (ARM) carry equivalent amounts of virus in their blood, brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, and thymus throughout life. Of five additional H-2k murine strains tested, C3H/HEJ and CBA/N mice develop this GH-like disorder, whereas neither AKR/J, B10/BR, nor BALB/KAE mice do, indicating that the H-2K haplotype does not control the GH susceptibility. Furthermore C3H/SW mice, which have the H-2b haplotype on the C3H background, develop the disease, again negating any correlation with H-2k but inferring that the C3H background is responsible. One half of the hybrid offspring produced by crossing the C3H/ST GH-deficient strain with BALB/WEHI-resistant mice develop the disease, but the trait is not sex linked. F1 hybrid backcrosses with the susceptible C3H/ST parental strain or resistant BALB/WEHI strain indicate the involvement of more than two genes. Hence the development of a GH deficiency by LCMV-infected C3H/ST mice is not linked to the MHC haplotype, is not sex linked, and is not due to a dominant gene. Multiple genes are involved and these are related to C3H background.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multifactorial systemic disease in which genetic, immunologic, hormonal, and environmental factors may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Bacterial products (eg, bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) induce a lupuslike disease in normal mice and trigger an early and accelerated form of lupus nephritis in NZB/W mice. To investigate whether the mechanism by which LPS accelerates nephritis in the NZB/W mice involves interference with processing of immune complexes (IC), we administered LPS to NZB/W mice for 5 weeks and probed the kinetics of removal, liver uptake, and organ localization of a subsaturating dose of radiolabeled IC (2.5 mg of bovine serum albumin-antibovine serum albumin). Control NZB/W mice received vehicle (saline) alone. In NZB/W exposed to LPS, features of polyclonal B-cell activation (PBA) were enhanced, anti-DNA antibodies were raised, and a proliferative glomerulonephritis developed that was associated with renal insufficiency and substantial proteinuria. This LPS-accelerated nephritis could not be attributed to altered complement concentration, to altered blood cell carrier function, to delayed removal of pathogenic (large-sized) ICs from the circulation, to impaired liver uptake of ICs, or to enhanced localization of ICs in kidney. The findings indicate that transformation of nephritis is probably the result of LPS-induced PBA, that defective processing of pathogenic IC is not a contributory factor to nephritis, and that mechanisms other than passive renal localization of circulating ICs must be operative.\r"

The present study evaluated the separate and combined interaction of fibrinogen coupled to colloidal gold (Fgn/Au) and small latex particles with fixed and unfixed, surface-activated platelets. Results demonstrate that populations of GPIIb-IIIa and other mobile receptors on fully spread platelets are not exhausted by binding and transporting a single ligand. Addition of a first ligand followed by a second one results in concentration of the initial wave in the platelet center, surrounded by a halo of second ligand. The margin of the double-labeled cell is cleared of both ligands. However, if the double-labeled platelet is fixed briefly and exposed to a third wave of ligand, that also will bind to the cell and cover the peripheral margin. How many waves of ligand can couple to spread platelets and translocate before the ability of the plasma membrane receptors to bind and clear has been depleted remains to be determined. Yet evidence of the interaction with three waves indicates that the surface-activated platelet has a nearly inexhaustible population of mobile receptors to participate in hemostatic events.\r"

The authors examined resting, standing, and change (standing minus resting) in plasma norepinephrine levels in 14 drug-free patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and in 33 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Schizophrenic patients had significantly higher resting and standing plasma norepinephrine levels and significantly greater change. Resting and standing levels were significantly related to positive and negative symptoms. There was a significant positive correlation between resting plasma and CSF norepinephrine levels and a significant negative correlation between CSF homovanillic acid and resting, standing, and change in plasma norepinephrine levels.\r"

A principal components analysis isolated three underlying personality constructs--dependency, introversion, and timidity. Patients with nonmelancholic-nonendogenous depression scored as significantly more dependent.\r"

Repeated standardized rating scales, mood assessments, and self-reports of dietary habits were used to measure changes in binge frequency and cognitive processes associated with food intake. The women who received desipramine reduced their frequency of binge eating by 63%, but women receiving placebo increased their frequency of binge eating by 16%. Twelve weeks after initiating treatment, 60% of the treatment group but only 15% of the placebo group abstained from binge eating. The women who received desipramine showed significantly more dietary restraint and reported significantly less hunger, suggesting that desipramine acts to suppress appetite. These preliminary findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of desipramine established in the treatment of purging bulimia nervosa extend to patients with nonpurging bulimia.\r"

The incidence of anorexia nervosa did not increase significantly during 1983-1985 compared to 1973-1975, in contrast to the constant increase found between 1956 and 1975. However, the more frequent use of vomiting and abuse of laxatives in 1983-1985 may indicate an increase in cases with mixed features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia.\r"

Smoking contributed significantly to thyroid size and goiter. In nonsmoking patients, ultrasonically determined thyroid volume was significantly related to treatment duration. The mechanism behind this increased thyroid volume is unclear, as most patients had normal serum thyrotropin levels and no thyroid autoimmunity. Subclinical or overt hypothyroidism was found in 4% and 21% of patients treated for 1-5 and more than 10 years, respectively. Since few hypothyroid patients had autoimmunity or goiter, lithium may affect the thyroid gland directly.\r"

At follow-up, 70% of the subjects who were initially classified as alcohol abusers were still abusers or were classified as remitted.

  ".U": "91023258\r", 
  ".W": "Mosquitoes of 3 species (Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus) were fed on human blood containing various concentrations of ivermectin. Three effects (death, decreased egg production, and reduced egg hatching) were observed in the insects, depending upon the concentration of ivermectin ingested. The LD50 of ivermectin in human blood for the 3 mosquito species was estimated to be 126, 208, and 698 ng/ml, respectively. Mosquitoes dying after ingestion of ivermectin developed signs of acute toxicity including paralysis, lethargy, incoordination, and difficulty in movement. Death usually occurred within 48-72 hr. With sublethal blood concentrations of the chemical, mosquitoes survived, but there was a marked reduction in both the number and viability of their eggs. This infertility was only temporary, however, as subsequent refeeding of the insects on uncontaminated blood resulted in the production of normal numbers of fertile eggs. Blood levels of ivermectin which made 50% of the eggs infertile in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were calculated 3.4 and 4.3 ng/ml, respectively. These latter concentrations of the chemical are within the range found in blood of humans and domestic animals receiving ivermectin for treatment of parasitic infections. This finding suggests that the widespread use of ivermectin in veterinary and human medicine may have an unrecognized effect on mosquito populations.\r"

  ".W": "Resurgence of falciparum malaria occurred in the Central Highlands of Madagascar in the 1980s and the disease is currently hyperendemic. We determined the humoral and cellular responses to synthetic peptides reproducing the repeat sequences of 2 major Plasmodium falciparum antigens: the Pf155/RESA and the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Blood samples from 83 subjects living in a rural community near Antananarivo were obtained at the beginning and the end of the transmission season. At enrollment, 40 subjects presenting with and 43 without blood parasites had similar T cell proliferative response and antibody level to all antigens tested. However, P. falciparum-infected individuals exhibited a decrease in the absolute number of T lymphocytes, due to a diminished number of CD8+ and natural killer lymphocytes. The number of CD4+ cells was similar in both groups. In the overall population, 45% of subjects had a T cell response to at least 1 RESA peptide (29-35% responding to a given peptide) and 35% to the CS protein peptide. Thirty-two percent of the donors presented with RESA antibodies and 23% had CS protein antibodies. After 20 weeks, at the end of the transmission season, cellular proliferative responses to all antigens markedly decreased as evidenced by a decrease of both the number of responders and mean stimulation indexes. Humoral response to RESA, as detected by erythrocyte membrane immunofluorescence (number of responders and mean antibody titers) markedly increased. Humoral responses to the CS protein and RESA peptides were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dialyzed serum was added to synchronous cultures containing schizonts for either the total 48 hr test period or only the last 24 hr in order to analyze the effects on erythrocytic invasion and intraerythrocytic growth, respectively. Reduction in 3H-hypoxanthine uptake was used to determine the percent of inhibition compared to nonimmune serum. One hundred seventy sera from Mindanao and Palawan in the South, the centrally located island of Mindoro, and Luzon in the North, were tested against 4 P. falciparum strains from the Philippines and 1 from Africa. Indirect fluorescent antibody titers were not predictive of inhibition. Inhibition of merozoite invasion rather than intraerythrocytic parasite growth is suggested by this study. Generally, sera were more inhibitory to parasite strains from the same geographical area than to those from more remote areas.\r"

Cryptosporidium was identified in 17 children (8%), Giardia lamblia in 42 (20%), and 3 children (1%) had both parasites. At the time of diagnosis, diarrheal symptoms were present in a minority of subjects: 36% of children with Cryptosporidium alone, 10% with G. lamblia alone, and in 20% of those with neither parasite. Although chronic nutritional status (height/age) was similar in all groups, acute nutritional status (weight/height) was lower only in children with Cryptosporidium (Z score = -1.39 +/- 0.13) compared with children with G. lamblia (mean Z score +/- SEM = -0.56 +/- 0.26) or neither parasite (Z score = -0.78 +/- 0.13; P = 0.05). Detectable levels of Cryptosporidium-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA were identified in 15 of 16 Thai children with Cryptosporidium and in 17 of 19 Thai children without Cryptosporidium (mean OD +/- SEM = 1.27 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.13, respectively), but in only 1 of 18 sera from toddlers in day-care centers in Denver, CO (OD = 0.128 +/- 0.03). Although neither infection with Cryptosporidium nor G. lamblia was consistently associated with acute diarrheal symptoms, Cryptosporidium was more often associated with depressed acute nutritional status than G. lamblia. The high prevalence of specific antibodies to Cryptosporidium in Thai orphans suggests an association between high rates of exposure with asymptomatic excretion of the parasites.\r"

Of the 2,938 persons interviewed, 143 (5%) reported having had cutaneous leishmaniasis at some time in the past, 37 (1.3%) reported the onset of infection in the 12 months before the survey, 31 (1.1%) had active infections, and 16 (0.5%) had parasitologically confirmed infections. Calculated on the basis of these reports and the estimated population of the endemic area, the total number of new cases in the leishmaniasis-endemic area in the 12 months before the survey was approximately 2,574; during the same 12 month period, Ministry of Health data based on passive surveillance listed 64 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. In Guatemala, incidence estimates based on passive surveillance may underestimate the occurrence of cutaneous leishmaniasis by as much as a factor of 40.\r"

Parasite burdens, lymphatic lesion severity, granulomatous reactivity, antibody responses to parasite antigens, and complete blood cell counts were assessed at 60 and 150 days post-inoculation. At 60 days post-inoculation, percentages of adults recovered at necropsy and lymphatic lesion severity were greater in B. pahangi-infected jirds. At 150 days post-inoculation, lesion severity and percentages of worms recovered were similar in both infections. No significant differences were noted in either infection in reactivity to homologous or heterologous parasite antigens in any parameter measured. Similarities in the kinetics of the inflammatory reactivities of the 2 infections suggest that previous observations made in the jird-B. pahangi model could be utilized in designing studies using B. malayi. Further, the more marked lesion severity observed in B. pahangi-infected jirds and the relative ease of maintaining B. pahangi in the laboratory support the continued use of this system as a conceptual model for the study of lymphatic lesion pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "A longitudinal entomological survey of the vectors of loiasis was conducted in the Missama area (Lekoumou region) in the Congo from September 1987 to August 1989. The principal catching site was a palm grove surrounded by forest 3 km from the village. Landing/biting densities of Chrysops were measured by standardized fly catches lasting 11 hr carried out twice a month. Vector landing densities were also assessed in the Bantu and Pygmy villages and in the fields. Populations of Chrysops from the palm grove were examined 6 times a month for infection with the infective stage of Loa loa. Chrysops silacea was the predominate vector except at the beginning of the rainy season, when C. dimidiata was the prevailing species. Chrysops were caught throughout rainy season, from October to June. The host-seeking activity of C. silacea was greatest in the middle of this season (February), but occurred sooner (October) for C. dimidiata. The following variables associated with transmission were calculated from our observations in the palm grove (the first figure corresponds to the first year of the study and the figure in parentheses corresponds to the second year). It was calculated that 2.658 (2.185) C. silacea and 1.412 (1.182) C. dimidiata could bite a person in the palm grove per year, including an average of 14.4 (12.7) infective C. silacea and 9.8 (7.2) infective C. dimidiata. The percentage of all dissected flies with third stage larvae in the head and the mean number of larvae in the head/infective fly were 0.57% and 10.1 +/- 6.8 for C. silacea and 0.66% and 11.2 +/- 6.5 for C. dimidiata, respectively. The estimated annual transmission potentials were 171.1 (102.9) for C. silacea and 116.1 (73.8) for C. dimidiata. In the palm grove, transmission was ensured by 2 effective vectors during the rainy season (October to May). Although the annual biting rate for both species was twice as low in the village as in the forest, our data suggest that effective transmission occurs there also.\r"

The target of eradication by 1995 has been set by the African Regional Office of the World Health Organization and accepted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Development Program. India and Pakistan continue to reduce their cases of the disease dramatically. In Africa, Ghana and Nigeria conducted national village-by-village searches in 1988-1990 and, between them, found greater than 800,000 cases of the disease. Most African countries have now prepared national plans of action, appointed national coordinators, and intend to use UNICEF's assistance to conduct national searches by the end of 1990. An international donors' conference held in 1989 facilitated major new assistance for the initiative by UNICEF, the United Nations Development Program, the United States Agency for International Development, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, the Peace Corps, the American Cyanamid Company, and DuPont. The World Health Organization held a meeting early in 1990 to draft criteria and recommend the process for certifying achievement of elimination of dracunculiasis in formerly endemic countries. The major remaining obstacles to eradication of dracunculiasis by 1995 are civil wars in northeastern Africa and the apathy of some national and international officials.\r"

We suggest the name Weldona virus for these isolates.

Twenty-seven patients (3%) remained hypercalcemic or developed hypercalcemia within 6 months of surgery. Of these, five patients had one adenoma removed initially; at reoperation, three patients had a second adenoma that was successfully removed, whereas the other two patients had hyperplasia and required subtotal parathyroidectomies. No enlarged parathyroid glands were identified in 22 patients. Eventually, six patients became normocalcemic spontaneously, seven patients underwent re-exploration with a successful outcome in all but one case, two patients had ectopic hyperparathyroidism associated with carcinoma elsewhere, and seven patients refused reoperation and remain hypercalcemic. The failure rate of surgical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism can be reduced by systematically exploring all four parathyroid glands. All abnormal parathyroids should be removed with histologic verification. When no abnormal glands are found, localization studies should be performed before re-exploration.\r"

In order to delineate the indications for surgery in these patients, a retrospective analysis of 53 consecutive patients treated with parathyroidectomy was conducted. Subtotal thyroidectomy was done in 37 of 45 patients undergoing their initial operations for HPT. Eight additional patients were referred after failed operations. Of 33 patients with preoperative bone pain, 70% improved. Joint pain improved in 87% of 30 patients, pruritus improved in 81% of 27 patients, and preoperative malaise improved in 73% of 33 patients after parathyroidectomy. Abdominal pain and irritated eyes were unlikely to improve. The best predictors of a successful outcome were a markedly elevated preoperative immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (mid-region) level and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. There were no perioperative deaths. One patient (1.6%) had a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and one patient required reoperation for a neck hematoma. No patient had permanent hypoparathyroidism, but transient hypocalcemia (less than 7 mg/dL) occurred in 22%. Postoperative hypocalcemia correlated with elevated preoperative alkaline phosphatase levels (r2 = 0.247).\r"

The current study was undertaken, in part, to apprehend information regarding contested areas in the management of patients having differentiated (papillary/follicular) thyroid cancer. A total of 2,282 patients with either papillary or follicular carcinoma of the thyroid from 76 different Illinois hospitals and providing 10 years of follow-up information (life-table analysis) were retrospectively analyzed for demographic, disease, and treatment-related predictors of survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards method was made for stage, age, race, sex, morphology, history of radiation exposure, presence of positive lymph nodes, initial surgical treatment, postoperative iodine 131 therapy, and replacement/suppressive thyroid hormone treatment. Statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) predictors of favorable survival after thyroid cancer were low stage (I and II), young age (less than 50 years), white race, female sex, and the administration, postoperatively, of either thyroid hormone or radioactive iodine. Factors that had no influence on survival were lymph node status, choice of initial surgical treatment, and a history of prior irradiation. We suggest that where a prospective clinical trial is impracticable, a retrospective analysis of a large and detailed database, such as that available from cooperating hospital-based tumor registries, may yet provide useful insights to solutions of cancer management problems.\r"

The most severe side effects were noted in the fields of radiation and included hypoplasia of the jaw, orbit, or hemi-face with varying degrees of atrophy of the overlying soft tissues. A wide range of endocrine, dental, and psychologic abnormalities was also documented.

The median length of hospitalization for those developing complications was 33 days compared with 16 days for those who did not develop any complications. Thirty-five (26%) of the 135 patients developing complications required reoperation and only 2 among these required a second flap.

Chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (CASP) is a recently developed photosensitizer. In order to study the direct vascular effects of CASP on a non-tumor system, a rat window chamber was utilized. Twelve rats were implanted with the window chamber, and were divided into two groups of six. Three rats served as controls for each group (receiving light alone, CASP alone, or no treatment). The remaining 6 rats received 10 mg/kg CASP intravenously 4 days after chamber placement. Photoactivation with light was performed 24 hours after injection (power density 200 mW/cm2, irradiance 100 J/cm2, lambda = 675 nm). Utilizing integrating sphere measurements and image analysis, marked vascular changes in the form of initial vasospasm followed by vaso-constriction and loss of chamber neovascularization were noted in the CASP-PDT group. The control groups exhibited no significant changes. Manipulation of the chamber vasculature at strategic time-points may translate into improved response rates for photodynamic therapy in a tumor model.\r"

Seventy-two patients (41%) had low-grade sarcomas and 104 (59%) had high-grade sarcomas. All but 18 patients underwent some form of excision as initial therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with surgical excision showed no significant effect. A significantly increased risk of treatment failure was associated with large tumor size, positive surgical margins, bone involvement, local recurrence, metastatic spread, and high histologic grade. Except for recurrence, the p value by univariate analysis in the log-rank test for comparison of survival according to these clinical and pathologic characteristics was p less than 0.0001. Although the overall survival was 75% at 2 years, 55% at 5 years, and 46% at 10 years, only 20% of the patients with high-grade sarcomas were alive 10 years after treatment. Most patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, high-grade peripheral nerve tumor, and high-grade fibrous histiocytoma and all patients with high-grade angiosarcoma died of disease less than 5 years after diagnosis. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the survival of adult patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck.\r"

The major reasons for this controversy are the difficulty in cytologic evaluation and the fact that the extent of surgery can be easily defined based on clinical judgement. However, a preoperative diagnosis is helpful in discussions with patients regarding the extent and type of surgery. Apart from the fact that needle biopsy can distinguish benign from malignant conditions, it is also very useful in distinguishing between salivary and other nonsalivary pathology. Over the past 7 1/2 years, we have performed 160 needle aspirations of parotid, submandibular, and submucosal lesions. Adequate specimens for cytologic evaluation were obtained in 155 patients (97%). A total of 84 parotid lesions, 70 submandibular lumps, and 6 submucosal abnormalities were detected. A cytologic diagnosis of benign pathology was made in 120 patients. Twelve patients had lymphoma and the diagnosis was suspected based on needle aspiration. There were 10 patients with tuberculosis and 30 patients with hyperplastic lymph nodes or benign lymphoepithelial disease of the parotid. There were three false-positive and two false-negative reports. No complications such as hematoma, nerve injury, or infection developed. The major difficulty was in distinguishing between malignancy and obstructive sialadenitis in the submandibular region. Needle aspiration was helpful in evaluating lesions in the tail of the parotid and submandibular area. The cytologic distinction between salivary and nonsalivary pathology was useful in planning the appropriate surgery and the extent of surgical resection. From a clinical standpoint, the distinction between benign and malignant salivary and nonsalivary pathology was very helpful. Preoperative diagnosis of Warthin's tumor, lymphoma, or benign lymphoepithelial disease was essential to the correct management of these patients.\r"

Histopathologic characteristics noted included the presence of exposed capsule, breaks of the capsule, capsular incompleteness, tumor ingrowth and thickness, cellularity, and lymphocytic infiltration. Tracings of histopathology slides were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional configuration of each tumor as viewed from different angles. No tumor had a smooth surface. At the extreme, two tumor lumps were connected by just a narrow waist. Separated tumors were not seen. In only one specimen did a lymph node contain an additional tumor in the form of an adenolymphoma. All tumors showed some exposed capsule or \"bare area\" to a degree affected mainly by the position of the tumor. Capsular damage was occasionally seen and was usually minor. Capsular incompleteness and tumor ingrowth make global capsular dissection unsafe. It is concluded that formal parotidectomy remains the operation of choice for pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland, although capsular dissection (otherwise termed enucleation) cannot be entirely avoided during the procedure.\r"

Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing. Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period. Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing. Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months. Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory. For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect. Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors.\r"

Over 7 years, 26 patients have undergone 28 free flaps for mandibular reconstruction, 15 for primary squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth or tongue, 7 for recurrent tumor, and 6 for other reasons [lymphangioma (1), infection (1), gunshot wound (1), and osteoradionecrosis (3)]. Primary reconstruction was performed in 19 cases and secondary in 9. All repairs were composite flaps including 12 scapula, 5 radial forearm, 3 fibula, 2 serratus, and 6 deep circumflex iliac artery. Mandibular defects included the symphysis alone (7), symphysis and body (5), symphysis-body-ramus condyle (2), body or ramus (13), and bilateral body (1). Fourteen patients had received prior radiotherapy to adjuvant or curative doses. Eight received postoperative radiotherapy. All patients had initially successful vascularized reconstruction by clinical examination (28) and positive radionuclide scan (22 of 22). Bony stability was achieved in 25 of 26 patients and oral continence in 24 of 26. One complete flap loss occurred at 14 days. Complications of some degree developed in 22 patients including partial skin necrosis (3), orocutaneous fistula (3), plate exposure (1), donor site infection (3), fracture of reconstruction (1), and fracture of the radius (1). Microvascular transfer of bone and soft tissue allows a reliable reconstruction--despite previous radiotherapy, infection, foreign body, or surgery--in almost every situation in which mandible and soft tissue are absent. Bony union, a healed wound, and reasonable function and appearance are likely despite early fistula, skin loss, or metal plate or bone exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Microsurgery has improved the success rate for reconstruction of composite defects in the head and neck. Restoration of mandibular continuity alone is not adequate for reconstruction. Replacement of the oral lining with thin tissue is necessary to improve tongue mobility and to set the stage for later dental restoration. There is currently no ideal osteocutaneous free flap that provides unlimited length of bone, can undergo multiple osteotomies to produce the proper curve to the reconstructed mandible, and provides thin skin for oral lining. Combining free flaps can take advantage of the strengths of the individual donor sites and eliminate some of the problems with current osteocutaneous flaps. In six patients, a fibular osseous free flap was combined with either a radial forearm flap or a lateral arm flap to provide bone and oral lining in reconstruction of mandibular composite defects. In these selected patients, the fibula provided the blood supply for the second free flap, which was placed sequentially. The distal peroneal vessels were used to anastomose to the radial forearm vessels or the lateral arm pedicle. This approach allows the surgeon to customize the defect by improving both the functional and aesthetic aspects of reconstruction and is of use in cases where vascular access is limited, such as following head and neck surgery and radiation.\r"

Primary tumors were located in the oral cavity in 501 patients, in the oropharynx in 207 patients, in the hypopharynx in 126 patients, and in the larynx in 247 patients. Lymph node metastases were confirmed histologically in 82% of 776 therapeutic neck dissections, and micrometastases were discovered in 33% of 343 elective RNDs. Lymph node groups in the neck were described by levels (I to V). Predominance of certain levels was seen for each primary site. Levels I, II, and III were at highest risk for metastasis from cancer of the oral cavity, and levels II, III, and IV were at highest risk for metastasis from carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Supramohyoid neck dissection (clearing levels I, II, and III) for NO patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and anterolateral neck dissection (clearing levels II, III, and IV) for NO patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx are recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred ninety-eight consecutive, previously untreated patients undergoing surgery for epidermoid carcinoma of the oral cavity from 1979 to 1983 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-nine patients were classified as having positive surgical margins. Of these, 83 patients had tumor within 0.5 mm of the surgical margin, 9 had premalignant changes at the margin, 9 had in situ carcinoma at the margin, and 28 had invasive cancer at the margin. The remaining 269 patients had uninvolved margins. The significance of positive margins relating to survival, subsequent clinical course, local recurrence, and patterns of treatment failure was examined, along with the impact of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy on positive margins. The percentage of patients having positive margins progressively increased with increasing T stage: 21% in T1 versus 55% in T4 primary cancer. The overall 5-year survival for patients with negative margins was 60%. For patients with positive margins, 5-year survival was 52%. This difference was statistically significant. The incidence of local recurrence in patients having positive surgical margins was twice as much as in those with negative margins (36% versus 18%). Metastasis rates in the neck and at distant sites were not significantly influenced by the status of the surgical margin. Of the 129 patients with positive margins, 49 received postoperative radiotherapy. In those patients so treated, a trend toward lower recurrence rates was noted. Differences were not statistically significant. This retrospective review confirms the importance of adequate resection of the primary tumor as well as the relative ineffectiveness of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy in the improvement of local control in patients with positive surgical margins.\r"

Fifty-four patients had T1 or T2 primaries, while 115 patients had T3 or T4 tumors (4 were not staged). Lymph node metastasis was present in 120 patients. Early primary tumors treated with surgery or radiotherapy had a control rate of 83% (5 of 6 tumors) and 89% (40 of 45 tumors), respectively. For advanced primary tumors, definitive radiotherapy produced a local control rate of 55% (42 of 76 tumors), compared with 79% (23 of 29 tumors) for surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. If primary control was obtained, the regional failure rate was less than 10%. Tumor growth patterns were predictive of the response to radiotherapy. The primary control rate at 2 years for 21 patients with exophytic tumors was 84% as opposed to 58% for 62 patients with ulcerative-infiltrative tumors (p = 0.04). Radiotherapy is effective for early stage or exophytic tumors, whereas for advanced or deeply invasive tumors combined therapy enhances local control.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed a 12-year experience with 295 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the pharynx in order to focus on 78 patients whose lesions arose in the posterior wall. Surgery was the definitive therapy for the primary tumor in 57 (73%), including 3 treatment groups. Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients). The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy. All required flap reconstruction. Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy. Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors. Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall. Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone. Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy. Innovative brachytherapy techniques using surgery for access deserve further investigation.\r"

Although patients with stage III tumors had a longer disease-free survival than stage IV patients (p less than 0.0002), the addition of DNA content information did not improve the ability to predict response. Specifically, there was no correlation between DNA content and the response to chemotherapy. In addition, for this group of patients, a diploid DNA content was not correlated with a survival advantage. We conclude that DNA content information did not add significantly to the prediction of clinical outcome in these patients who received induction chemotherapy.\r"

The different lateral temporal bone resections performed have been categorized into four types. The type I resection consists of the removal of the tympanic bone and the external auditory canal lateral to the tympanic membrane. The type II resection consists of the removal of the entire tympanic bone, the tympanic membrane, the incus, and the malleus, preserving the facial nerve and the inner ear. Type III resections remove, in addition to the those structures removed in type II resections, the distal facial nerve and fallopian canal, the mastoid tip, the styloid process, and the stylomastoid foramen. The type IV resection consists of the removal of only the mastoid tip and the inferior portion of the tympanic bone. When the techniques of lateral temporal bone resection are used appropriately, adequate surgical treatment of patients with selected advanced and recurrent malignant tumors of the external ear, the periauricular skin, and the parotid is possible with low morbidity and a high probability of local regional control.\r"

One hundred three previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were prospectively evaluated for serum IgA, IgG, and IgM and C1q-binding macromolecules. Immunoglobulins were assessed by the immunoturbidimetric technique. C1q-binding macromolecules (C1qBM) were measured utilizing the iodine-125 assay of Zubler et al (J Immunol 1976; 116: 232-5). Neither the level of serum immunoglobulins nor C1qBM values were correlated with the primary site, AJC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage of disease, or size of primary lesion. Likewise, comparison of serum IgA with C1qBM values demonstrated that these laboratory parameters were independent variables (r = 0.15 by Pearson linear regression). Univariate statistical analysis, utilizing the Cox proportional hazard model, showed serum IgA and C1qBM values to each contribute significantly to the ability to predict survival in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (p = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate analysis reveals that both C1qBM and serum IgA levels contribute significantly to the hazards model beyond staging in predicting survival (p less than 0.001). Predictive results were most apparent in patients with stage IV disease and related to the probability of both regional and distant metastatic recurrences. Conversely, serologic analysis provided no information in patients who were staged early. These results support pretreatment multiparametric serologic analysis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\r"

This study focused on the patients with LNUP. Only 86 patients were treated with surgery (plus radiotherapy). Other patients were treated with radiotherapy (84) or chemotherapy (13) or had no treatment (7). For the overall population, failures in the neck occurred in 51% of the patients and distant metastases in 27%, while primary tumors appeared in 16%. Survival rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 27%, 19%, and 7%, respectively, for the overall population and 45%, 35%, and 19%, respectively, for the surgical group. The diagnosis and therapeutic approach had a direct effect on neck control; failure in the neck occurred in 7 of 47 patients (15%) when fine needle aspiration and radical neck dissection with radiotherapy were performed, in 5 of 12 patients (42%) when fine needle aspiration and modified neck dissection with radiotherapy were used, in 5 of 12 patients (42%) when adenectomy diagnosis and radiotherapy treatment were performed, and in 6 of 11 patients (54%) when diagnosis by incisional biopsy was performed prior to admission, despite subsequent radical neck dissection and radiotherapy treatment. In our opinion, panendoscopy and fine needle aspiration should be the first-line diagnostic approach. When cytologic diagnosis proves impossible, the second-line approach must consist of cervical exploration with frozen section examination and excisional biopsy, followed by immediate appropriate treatment. In cases of LNUP, radical neck dissection seems to be preferable.\r"

There were no complications during the interval between resection and reconstruction. Following reconstruction, minor wound complications occurred in 6% of patients; there were no major complications. Microscopic examination of the re-excised wound revealed residual disease in 2 of 45 cases of basal cell carcinoma and 0 of 10 other cutaneous malignancies. Both patients with residual basal cell carcinomas (i.e., false-negative margins after Mohs' surgery) had presented to the Mohs' surgeon with recurrent tumors. During a follow-up period of 3 months to 3 years after complete resection, recurrent tumor developed in 2 of 45 cases of basal cell carcinoma and 3 of 8 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Delayed reconstruction, usually 5 to 20 days after Mohs' chemosurgery, can be performed without significant morbidity. Re-excision of the Mohs' chemosurgical wound for pathologic examination can detect residual disease and may be especially indicated for large recurrent wounds.\r"

Ablative surgery was performed for squamous carcinoma (22), melanoma (2), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (2). Seven patients died of recurrent disease during a 3 1/2 year follow-up. Seven patients are alive with recurrence. Flap complications included total loss (2) due to unsalvageable microvascular thrombosis, wound breakdown with oropharyngeal fistula (2), mandibular osteomyelitis (1), trismus (2), neck contracture (1), and donor site wound dehiscence (1). The overall success of this reconstruction was 93%. Primary wound healing was the general rule with lower morbidity than with other reconstructive techniques. The flap is thin, pliable, and conforms well to three-dimensional defects. The lateral border of the scapula can be incorporated on the same vascular pedicle for single-stage mandibular reconstruction. No muscle is sacrificed, and the posterior donor defect is an added advantage. The parascapular flap is our first choice for reconstruction of major defects in the head and neck.\r"

Control groups for plasma noradrenaline were 25 patients admitted to hospital for elective gastroscopy and 12 laboratory workers accustomed to venipuncture. Controls for platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor measurements were a separate group of 31 normal subjects with a mean age close to that of the patients' withdrawing from ethanol. Plasma noradrenaline was significantly higher in the patients undergoing ethanol withdrawal than in patients admitted to hospital for elective endoscopy. Twelve laboratory controls had plasma noradrenaline levels significantly lower than either patient group. A significant though poor statistical correlation existed between ethanol withdrawal score and simultaneously determined plasma noradrenaline level. Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites/cell were reduced in ethanol withdrawal compared with the normal controls. Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites/cell increased over the first 24 hr of ethanol withdrawal but remained significantly lower than control values. The change in platelet adrenoceptors was accompanied by a fall in mean plasma noradrenaline. Thus, the stress of hospital admission itself is associated with an increase in plasma noradrenaline, but ethanol withdrawal enhances this increase, which is accompanied by and probably causes a reduction in platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor numbers. These changes begin to return towards normal within 24 hr as the withdrawal reaction subsides.\r"

Recent studies from our laboratory have suggested that GABA transmission and the GABAA-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore complex might be involved in the rewarding action of ethanol in alcohol-preferring rats. We report here immunocytochemical and morphometric studies analyzing the GABAergic terminal density in the nucleus accumbens (NA), corpus striatum, nucleus tractus solitarius, and lateral septum of the selectively bred P (alcohol-preferring) and the NP (alcohol-nonpreferring) lines of rats, as well as of the high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) lines of rats. The NA was included for analysis because this structure has been implicated as an important component of the brain reward system. An increase of GABAergic terminal density was found in the NA of the P rats, when compared with the NP rats. Similarly, there were more GABAergic terminals in the NA of HAD rats than of the LAD rats. No differences between the lines were seen in the other brain regions examined. The results suggest that alcohol preference in P and HAD rats may be related to increased GABA terminals and enhanced GABAergic inhibition within the NA.\r"

Catecholamine release induced by carbachol, 80 mM K+, BAY K 8644, and veratrine was studied in ethanol-treated and untreated cultures. The presence of ethanol in vitro was inhibitory to all these stimuli in untreated cell cultures, carbachol-induced release being most sensitive (IC50 approximately 30 mM). After growth in ethanol for 6 days, carbachol-induced catecholamine release was completely resistant to the inhibitory effects of ethanol. The resistance to ethanol of carbachol-induced catecholamine release from cells grown in medium containing ethanol also extended to the inhibitory effects of butanol. The results show some similarities with changes observed in the central nervous system during the development of ethanol tolerance, and it is suggested that this model system may be useful in examining the mechanisms by which tolerance occurs.\r"

A total of 48 males participated in the research. Experiment 1 tested drug-free learning of a motor skill task. Experiment 2 used the same task to test the acquisition of a drug-compensatory response (i.e., tolerance) under alcohol. Subjects in each experiment were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: mental rehearsal with imagined consequences (C), mental rehearsal with no imagined consequences (N), and rest (R). Both experiments confirmed the hypothesis. C treatment yielded superior drug-free performance, and a greater tolerance. The effect of N treatment was intermediate, and R treatment was least effective. It was concluded that incorporating an imagined consequence of mental performance enhances the learning of alcohol tolerance and the acquisition of a motor skill. Factors that may have contributed to the marginal efficacy of N treatment were discussed, and research implications were considered.\r"

To assess the contribution of maternal genotype to ethanol teratogenesis, a reciprocal cross study was conducted in an animal model using C57BL/6J (B6) and long-sleep (LS) mice. B6 mice are more susceptible than LS mice to prenatal ethanol-induced malformations but both mouse stocks are susceptible to fetal weight deficits following in utero alcohol exposure. B6 and LS dams were reciprocally mated to B6 or LS males producing four embryonic genotype groups: the true-bred B6B6 and LSLS genotypes, and the genetically similar B6LS and LSB6 genotypes (the F1 genotype). Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on gestation day 18, weighed, and assessed for soft tissue or skeletal malformations. Results showed a greater litter weight deficit and increased total malformation rate in ethanol-exposed F1 litters carried by B6 mothers compared to ethanol-exposed F1 litters carried by LS mothers. This result would be expected only if maternal genetic factors contribute significantly towards susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. The influence of the LS mother was to decrease susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the B6 mother while the influence of the B6 mother was to increase susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the LS mother. The average malformation rate for F1 litters was significantly less than the predicted midparental value. This shows that the F1 genotype exhibited dominance towards resistance to prenatal alcohol effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have used a mouse model system in which male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol sufficient to supply 37% of the total calories or isocaloric control diet in a pair-feeding design to examine the effect of ethanol on the immune system. The group consuming the ethanol-containing diet maintained relatively stable levels of blood ethanol for the 8 days of feeding. Consumption of ethanol for 8 days resulted in a profound loss of thymus and spleen cells, and the recovery of thymus cellularity was delayed relative to the recovery of spleen cell numbers after ethanol feeding was discontinued. Proliferation of spleen lymphocytes to T-cell stimuli (concanavalin A and alloantigens) was diminished; however, B-cell proliferation to lipopolysaccharide was relatively unchanged in mice fed ethanol-containing diet. Also in ethanol-fed mice a significant decrease in the primary antibody response to sheep red blood cells but not to the T-independent antigen trinitrophenol-ficoll occurred. These data establish the murine model system as a means to define further the effect of ethanol on the immune system and host defense mechanisms.\r"

In comparison two groups of healthy controls were studied. The mean daily dietary intake of calcium was 1.3 g in the patients and 1.2 g in the controls. The dietary intake of vitamin D was equal in the study groups, too. The serum levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone did not show any difference between the patients and controls but in the alcoholics the urinary excretion of calcium was reduced by 42% (p less than 0.0001) as compared to the controls. The serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were reduced in the alcoholics by 40% (p less than 0.0001), 23% (p less than 0.01), and 48% (p less than 0.0001), respectively, as compared to the controls. The alcoholic men had normal levels of serum testosterone and they did not have hypercortisolism. The bone mineral content of the dominant forearm measured by SPA was similar in the study groups as were the bone mineral densities (BMD) of the lumbar and humeral areas measured by CT.

The MAC failed to differentiate between the alcoholic and nonalcoholic groups and both groups scored above the recommended cutting score. The MAST significantly differentiated the alcoholic and nonalcoholic schizophrenic patients and was as sensitive to a history of alcohol abuse as to alcohol dependence. Neither the MAST nor MAC was sensitive to recent versus more remote drinking. The overall classificatory accuracy of the MAST was found to be 80% and that of the MAC was 56%. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of just four MAST items can yield a group classificatory rate of 83%. It was concluded that the MAST exhibited sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as an initial screening instrument for alcoholism in schizophrenic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Both acute and chronic ethanol consumption may cause esophageal dysmotility. In order to systematically evaluate the effect of ethanol on esophageal motility, we studied esophageal motility in 13 healthy subjects before and following acute intravenous administration of 0.8 g/kg ethanol and in chronic alcoholics within 6 hr of their last drink (n = 6) and following 24 to 48 hr of abstinence when signs of withdrawal were present (n = 13). Withdrawing alcoholics were also restudied after intravenous administration of 0.8 g/kg ethanol. Ethanol transiently decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and inhibited LES relaxation in all control subjects; this inhibitory effect of ethanol on LESP in alcoholics was significantly less, indicating the development of tolerance. Ethanol moderately decreased esophageal contraction amplitude (ECA) in 10 of 13 controls and prolonged duration of contractions in all but had no effect on velocity of esophageal contractions. In contrast, ECA was significantly elevated in both groups of alcoholics, but this was significantly more marked in withdrawing alcoholics. Ethanol infusion returned ECA toward normal values in withdrawing alcoholics. Abnormal motility was noted in three intoxicated alcoholics and 10 (77%) withdrawing alcoholics. This included nutcracker esophagus in five and hypertensive LES in two. These data indicated that (1) esophageal motor dysfunction is common in alcoholics; (2) acute ethanol administration decreases LESP and esophageal contraction amplitude, whereas chronic ethanol consumption and withdrawal from ethanol increases ECA. This suggests development of a compensatory mechanism in chronic alcoholics leading to high pressure esophageal contractions during withdrawal.\r"

The present experiment examines whether alcohol or dietary restriction is the more likely cause of this surprising finding. We conditioned 10 rats using a liquid diet containing ethanol as 36% of calories. Ten pair-fed control animals received an equal amount of isocaloric, ethanol-free liquid diet. Ten ad libitum control animals had unrestricted access to lab chow and water. Rats were killed after 30 weeks. Left costal diaphragm strips were studied in vitro at optimal length using direct stimulation at supramaximal voltage. Isometric force was measured and divided by muscle cross-section to compute stress. Maximal tetanic stresses developed by muscle from pair-fed controls were systematically less than alcoholic and ad libitum control values (p less than 0.0001); this did not depend on temperature (25 degrees vs. 37 degrees; p greater than 0.50). Pair-feeding increased twitch half-relaxation times (p less than 0.03) and shifted the tetanic stress-stimulation frequency relationship leftward by 10 Hz (p less than 0.01). Diaphragm of pair-fed rats continued to generate lower stresses during the fatigue caused by repeated contractions (p less than 0.01). We conclude that dietary restriction associated with pair-feeding compromises diaphragm performance in rats. Chronic alcohol consumption prevents or reverses these changes, since diaphragm function of alcoholic and ad libitum control animals was not different.\r"

The experiments in vivo were conducted with groups of rats with and without indomethacin pretreatment, and the animals received either a dose of CBS (100 mg/kg) or a vehicle (saline), followed 30 min later by ethanol. In the in vitro studies, gastric mucosa segments were cultured in the presence of CBS, ethanol, or both. The results of in vivo experiments revealed that in the absence of CBS, ethanol caused extensive gastric hemorrhagic lesions which were significantly reduced following CBS pretreatment and this effect of CBS was not prevented by indomethacin. The data obtained with gastric mucosal culture established that in comparison to the controls, ethanol caused a 27% decrease in mucin synthesis, while mucin synthesis in the presence of CBS increased by 48%. The increase in mucin synthesis evoked by CBS was accompanied by the enhanced metabolism of mucosal phosphoinositides, as reflected by a decrease in PI (15%) and PIP2 (30%), and an increase in IP1 (26%) and IP3 (67%). In contrast, ethanol, which exhibited detrimental effect on mucin synthesis, caused a decrease in PIP (35%), IP2 (47%) and IP3 (38%), and an increase in PIP2 (80%), and IP1 (51%). However, when the mucosal culture was carried out in the presence of both CBS and ethanol, the detrimental changes evoked by ethanol on mucin synthesis were prevented, and the phosphoinositide and inositide phosphate distribution patterns were quite similar to those in the mucosa cultured in the presence of CBS only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred forty-one employed alcoholics were randomized to either Hazelden-type treatment (N = 74) or to traditional-type treatment (N = 67). The treatment groups were highly comparable. The bimonthly follow-up lasted one year. According to the COPES-questionnaire (short form), the treatment at the Hazelden-type institute was significantly more involving, supportive, encouraging to spontaneity and oriented to personal problems than at the traditional-type institute. In accordance the treatment drop-out rate was 7.9% at Hazelden-type institute and 25.9% at traditional-type institute (p less than 0.02). The participation in outpatient treatment was significantly better after the Hazelden-type treatment. The proportion of those abstinent (admitted ethanol consumption, 0 g/day; gammaglutamyl transferase, and mean cell volume were normal) was higher at Hazelden-type institute during the last (8-12 months) follow-up period (26.3% vs. 9.8%, p = 0.05). Fourteen percent of the Hazeldon-type institute patients and 1.9% of the traditional-type institute patients stayed abstinent during the whole 1-year follow-up period (p less than 0.05). The differences for the corresponding rates for controlled drinking (admitted ethanol consumption less than 40 g/day, GGT, and MCV normal) were in the same direction but did not reach statistical significance. Thus the Hazelden-type treatment obtained better results in 1-year abstinence rate than a more traditional-type treatment.\r"

Analysis of results showed a significantly marked increase following ethanol and acetone treatments of the p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (283 +/- 19% and 304 +/- 21%), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylation (280 +/- 105% and 228 +/- 95%), benzene hydroxylation (258 +/- 60% and 236 +/- 61%), butanol oxidation (173 +/- 34% and 154 +/- 32%), aniline hydroxylation (147 +/- 22% and 95 +/- 8%), and ether de-ethylation (95 +/- 17% and 83 +/- 17%) and a not significant increase of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) de-ethylation (34 +/- 11% and 9 +/- 8%) in rat microsomes, respectively, versus control animals (mean +/- SD, values expressed as nmol/min/nmole P-450). All of these activities significantly decreased after 3-MC treatment, except for the p-nitrophenol hydroxylation. PB treatment markedly enhanced NDEA de-ethylation, p-nitrophenol, and benzene hydroxylations (106 +/- 38%, 109 +/- 14%, and 153 +/- 62%, respectively) versus controls. These results suggest that NDMA and especially 1-butanol are the most specific and useful probes of alcohol-inducible cytochrome P-450 in crude liver microsomes.\r"

These subtypes of IA are differentially sensitive to ethanol, since the decay of current is significantly slowed in the presence of ethanol in one cell, while IA is unaffected by ethanol at the same concentrations in the other cell. In this paper, we examine a number of parameters including temperature sensitivity of these different IAS. While both currents fulfill the criteria for being called IA, they are significantly different with respect to the kinetics of activation and inactivation as well as recovery from inactivation. They do not differ significantly in the temperature sensitivity of a number of measured parameters, suggesting that ethanol and temperature do not act as a common locus; e.g., by affecting a bulk lipid membrane fluidity. In light of recent work describing the molecular biology of channels underlying IA, it is reasonable to assume that these IA subtypes reflect different underlying channels. This system may be useful for understanding the relationship of channel structure and function to ethanol action.\r"

The time required for inhibition of import to occur was now measured with ethanol (200 mM) and butanol (100 mM) at 0 degree and 30 degrees C. It required approximately 30 min to achieve 50% inhibition with butanol and 50 min with ethanol. To further substantiate the membrane perturbing effects of alcohols, we also examined the effect of oleic acid on import. We found that incubation of mitochondria with oleic acid (0-100 microM) resulted in inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor import in a dose response fashion. In addition to in vitro effects of alcohols on import, we conducted a preliminary study on import of protein into liver mitochondria isolated from rats fed ethanol. We found that the rate of aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor import into liver mitochondria isolated from ethanol fed rats was identical to that from control. The results are consistent with finding that the activity and amount of aldehyde dehydrogenase was the same in mitochondria isolated from the alcohol-fed or control animals.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have suggested that ethanol interacts with muscarinic cholinergic systems in the brain. In order to assess whether muscarinic systems regulate sensitivity to ethanol, the effects of oxotremorine pretreatment on sensitivity to ethanol were determined in the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice, which were selectively bred for differential sensitivity to ethanol. In addition, the relative sensitivity of these two lines to intraperitoneally (ip) injected oxotremorine and total muscarinic receptors, as measured by quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding, M1 receptor subtypes, as measured by pirenzepine (PZ) binding, and ratios of high and low agonist affinity were measured in seven brain regions. SS mice were more sensitive to oxotremorine-induced increases in sensitivity to ethanol but the LS mice were more sensitive to the effects elicited by ip oxotremorine injection. Because the effects of oxotremorine were blocked by scopolamine but not by methylscopolamine, it is likely that the effects of oxotremorine that were measured are centrally mediated. QNB binding did not differ between the LS and SS mice except for cortex where the SS mice exhibited slightly larger numbers. The mouse lines did not differ in the number of M1 receptors or in ratio of high to low affinity agonist sites. Therefore, it does not seem likely that differences in receptor numbers are important in regulating the differential sensitivities of the LS and SS mice to oxotremorine or ethanol. Differences in receptor coupling processes may be critically involved.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether or not tolerance develops to the effect of 3.0 g/kg ethanol on total and regional splanchnic blood flow in male Wistar rats. The animals were given the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days; ethanol-fed animals were withdrawn 24 hr prior to experiments. Regional blood flow and cardiac output (CO) were measured by the reference microsphere technique after an intraperitoneal injection of 3.0 g/kg of ethanol. Acute ethanol administration produced early nonsustained increases in portal vein blood flow in animals fed ethanol for 10 days and withdrawn for 24 hr and in control animals. However, after chronic exposure to ethanol, the pattern of increase in blood flow in response to ethanol in the splanchnic organs was different between the ethanol-fed and control groups. Increases in portal vein flow in control groups were due to concomitant increases in small intestinal, colonic, and cecal blood flow while the increase in the ethanol-fed group was due to a rise in small intestinal and stomach blood flow. The increase in stomach blood flow that occurred in the animals treated chronically with ethanol may be viewed as a conditioned response to ethanol, since this was not found in the control group. These results, demonstrate that the pattern of increase in blood flow in the splanchnic organs produced by an acute dose of ethanol depends on the animal's previous exposure to ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "Cloninger's clinical method of classifying alcoholics into two groups (Types I and II) was examined with data obtained from 360 VA hospitalized male alcoholic patients. For operational criteria, the Cloninger clinical method of subtyping alcoholics employs age-of-onset of problem drinking and symptom-clusters supposedly associated with each subtype. Marked overlap was found between the symptom-clusters used to define the two subtypes. Ninety-one percent of the entire sample satisfied criteria for both symptom-clusters. Dividing the sample by early-onset (Type II, less than or equal to 25 years) and late-onset (Type I, greater than 26 years) alcoholism did not substantially reduce the overlap between symptom-clusters; i.e., 96% of the early-onset and 83% of the late-onset subgroups were positive for both symptom-clusters. Only 21 men (6%) could be classified when both age-of-onset and the type-appropriate symptom-cluster were used to separate patients. In hospital settings, at least, these findings suggest that the two-group clinical alcoholism typology proposed by Cloninger basically reflects the age-of-onset of problem drinking.\r"

  ".W": "Isoflurane is a potent systemic vasodilator. Because isoflurane vasodilation is clinically significant, we sought to explore whether decreases in systemic vascular resistance caused by isoflurane involve the alpha-adrenergic nervous system in humans. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that isoflurane systemic vasodilation is mediated via inhibition of vascular alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness. Phenylephrine pressor dose-response curves were established before anesthesia and during isoflurane/oxygen anesthesia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery; all patients included in the study (n = 11) demonstrated significant (P = 0.0001) decreases in systemic vascular resistance when isoflurane was given in concentrations adequate to produce a 20% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. Polynomial regression of the phenylephrine dose-response curve was used to estimate the phenylephrine dose required to increase mean arterial blood pressure 15 mm Hg, designated PD15 mm Hg. Each patient served as his or her own control. Preanesthetic baseline PD15 mm Hg values (115 +/- 23 micrograms [1.4 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg], mean +/- SEM) were not significantly different from isoflurane PD15 mm Hg values (124 +/- 20 micrograms [1.5 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg]). End-tidal isoflurane concentration ranged from 0.6%-1.5%; isoflurane PD15 mm Hg was not correlated with end-tidal isoflurane concentration. Patient characteristics and hemodynamics did not affect PD15 mm Hg. These results suggest that isoflurane-induced systemic vasodilation is not mediated via inhibition of alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness, disproving our hypothesis. This finding has clinical importance because it demonstrates that alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine is effective in correcting hypotension in patients receiving isoflurane anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The 40-Hz auditory steady-state evoked response (ASSR) is a sinusoidal electrical response of the brain to periodically presented auditory stimuli. It was recorded during anesthesia in 10 elective surgical patients to evaluate its usefulness as a measure of the level of consciousness. The anesthetic agents used were thiopental, fentanyl, and isoflurane with or without nitrous oxide. Recordings were carried out during the period before induction and during induction, surgical anesthesia, emergence, and recovery from anesthesia. The level of consciousness was measured with an auditory stimulus detection task. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was also recorded for comparison with the ASSR. The following indices were analyzed: total EEG power, relative power in the beta, alpha, theta, and delta frequency bands, and the median and spectral edge frequency. The amplitude of the ASSR was reduced significantly at the end of the induction period and decreased below noise levels during surgical anesthesia. It increased significantly during emergence and recovery. The amplitude during recovery remained significantly smaller than the preinduction values. The changes of the ASSR paralleled those of the level of consciousness. The EEG measurements were distorted by the presence of muscle artifacts that were prominent during emergence and recovery. The amplitude of the ASSR appears to provide a more reliable indicator of the level of consciousness than the EEG.\r"

  ".W": "To examine if the choice of volatile agents influences cardiac outcome in coronary artery surgery, 1178 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting without additional operations received enflurane (608) or isoflurane (570) as their primary anesthetics. The inspired concentration of volatile agent (administered with 50% nitrous oxide) was adjusted depending on the level of blood pressure at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. In addition to the volatile agent assigned, each patient received small doses of fentanyl at induction and before sternotomy (total 0.006-0.008 mg/kg). The groups did not differ in preoperative and surgical characteristics except for a more frequent history of renal dysfunction in patients given isoflurane. The rates of postoperative myocardial infarction, administration of positive inotropic agents at the time of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, and in-hospital deaths in the enflurane and isoflurane groups were 1.8% and 4.0% (P less than 0.05), 4.9% and 8.1% (P less than 0.05%), and 0.3% and 2.1% (P less than 0.01), respectively. Although the mechanism of the adverse effects of isoflurane could not be clarified in this study, these results demonstrate that the use of isoflurane could be inappropriate in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"
