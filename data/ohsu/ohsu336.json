To simplify this therapy, we examined the clinical and immunologic response after extending the interval between maintenance venom injections to 6, 8, and 12 weeks. Twenty-six patients who had had sting anaphylaxis and positive skin tests received maintenance bee or yellow jacket venom immunotherapy at greater or equal to 6-week intervals. This extended interval was started after a prior average 4-week maintenance interval of 2.3 years. Injections were given at 6-week intervals to all 26 patients and extended to 8-week intervals in 10, and 12-week intervals in 3 patients. Following venom injections, there were 14 mild local reactions and no systemic reactions. No adjustment in dosing was necessary. While on prolonged interval maintenance venom immunotherapy, there were 17 re-stings in 12 patients with no systemic reactions. During prolonged interval maintenance venom immunotherapy, either the serum venom-specific IgG increased or the already elevated titers remained the same in 18 patients and decreased in 2. In the others, preexisting titers were low and unchanged. Serum venom-specific IgE tended to slowly decrease. These clinical and immunologic data suggest that a 4-week maintenance interval may be safely extended.\r"

In one method, daily increasing dose method (DIDM), a single antigen challenge was performed every day successively. In the other method, cumulative dose method (CDM), the antigen doses were administered successively with 7-minute intervals. The tests were considered positive when there was a fall of FEV1 greater than or equal to 20% of the baseline value. The DIDM showed a greater incidence of isolated late bronchoconstrictions. The CDM revealed a great incidence of biphasic reactions (early and late) and of laryngeal spasm. Two patients showed discordant results (positive with one method and negative with the other) suggesting problems related to intrasubject reproducibility.\r"

No clinical symptoms, local histamine release, or modifications of nasal airway resistance were observed when SP was insufflated in the nose. Conversely, intradermal injection with SP caused a wheal and flare reaction in all the studied subjects. The different response to SP is likely to be due to the heterogeneity of human skin and nasal mucosa mast cells as far as sensitivity to histamine-releasing agents is concerned. Our findings indicate that SP has no relevant effect on human nasal mucosa, even if a synergetic action of SP with other allergic mediators cannot be excluded. The role of SP in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases in humans remains to be defined and deserves further study.\r"

In exploring this association further, Eustachian tube function was measured in ten ragweed-allergic and eight non-allergic patients undergoing repetitive nasal provocation. Anterior nasal provocation was done using paper disks impregnated with either histamine or aqueous ragweed allergen. Increasing concentrations of the provocative agent were placed on both inferior nasal turbinates until moderate symptoms of rhinitis developed. Eustachian tube function was evaluated using the 9-step inflation-deflation tympanometric test before and immediately after each nasal challenge. Eustachian obstruction developed in 4 of 38 non-allergic ears during histamine nasal provocation. With ragweed nasal challenge, 9 of 42 allergic ears developed Eustachian tube obstruction. Four allergic ears gained Eustachian tube function despite being obstructed before the challenge. The observed changes in ear function for both groups were not significant due to variability in Eustachian response. At the concentrations which initiated symptoms of rhinitis, nasal provocation with histamine or ragweed did not consistently obstruct the Eustachian tube. We conclude that mild symptoms of allergic rhinitis may not cause significant Eustachian tube obstruction.\r"

Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained on all patients within 48 hours of admission. Seventy-two percent (36 of 50) had detectable CPK/MB. Ten patients had echocardiograms suggestive of cardiac contusion. Of these ten, three had no detectable CPK/MB and six had CPK/MB of less than 5%. CPK/MB had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 27.5%. We conclude that in the patient with multisystem injury, CPK/MB determinations are not reliable.

Prior FPRNA studies have shown that cardiac dysfunction after blunt chest trauma (myocardial contusion) is most often due to right ventricular dysfunction. We hypothesized that right ventricular dysfunction due to ischemic heart disease and myocardial contusion should produce similar ECG changes due to myocyte disruption. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the right precordial electrogram in suspected cardiac contusion. Thirty-five patients with suspected myocardial contusion based on mechanism of injury/clinical findings and no history of clinical heart disease were enrolled prospectively. All patients had conventional ECG, right precordial electrogram, and FPRNA studies. Twenty patients had normal cardiac scans (group 1); percentage of myocardial creatine kinase (CK-MB) was measured in 12 of these patients and was less than 5% in 11. Fifteen patients had abnormal cardiac scans (wall motion abnormality and/or decreased right ventricular ejection fraction) (mean, 34% +/- 7% [SD]; normal, greater than 40%) (group 2); percentage of CK-MB was measured in 13 of 15 patients and was less than 5% in all 13. Conventional ECGs and right precordial electrograms in all patients were analyzed for differences in heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT interval, and the axis of the frontal and horizontal plane QRS complex and ST segment. There were no significant differences between group 1 and group 2 patients. No patient with myocardial contusion diagnosed by FPRNA had elevated ST segments in V4R through V6R or a percentage CK-MB of more than 5%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In most trauma systems a combination of physiologic criteria (Trauma Score [TS]), mechanisms of injury (MOI), and anatomic injury (AI) are used as prehospital trauma triage criteria. The purpose of our study was to assess the predictive value of specific MOI and AI in detecting critically injured trauma victims (Injury Severity Score [ISS] of more than 15) and determine the best combination of TS, MOI, and AI that produced the lowest percentage of undertriage and overtriage. Previous studies have examined only patients triaged to trauma centers; our study included all trauma patients regardless of destination. A total of 1,473 trauma patients was evaluated and transported by the emergency medical services system and studied prospectively during a nine-week period. Prehospital TS, specific MOI and AI, and final disposition and diagnosis were determined on all patients. The ISS was calculated on all hospital admissions. A total of 97 patients had an ISS of more than 15. Three hundred forty-one (23%) had one of the specific MOI studied; 102 (6.9%) had one of the specific AI studied.

Thirty-five patients (53%) had associated injuries, of which rib fractures were the most common. Thirty-one patients (47%) had sternal fractures with no associated injury. The incidence of myocardial contusion in our study was 18%. Of the patients without associated injuries, the incidence of myocardial contusion was 6%. There were no mortalities in our study population, and there was no significant morbidity necessitating mechanical or pharmacologic support. The majority of these patients were managed by admission, observation, IV therapy, and placement of monitored beds. Our findings of no life-threatening sequelae suggest that we might question the necessity of current management criteria. This proves to be of special interest in view of the economic restraints imposed on health care today.\r"

Two of these commonly used immobilizers, the Zee Extrication Device and the long spinal board, use crisscrossing straps over the thorax to affix the patient to the device. Our study was designed to determine if these two devices alter pulmonary function in the healthy, nonsmoking man. We took 15 healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers and tested four pulmonary function parameters: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the ratio FEV1:FVC, and forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF 25%-75%). A Breon spirometer was used to test these functions both before and after the volunteers were strapped into the two devices. Three separate trials were given for each parameter and the best scores were used for data computation. Strap tension was controlled by placing a sphygmomanometer beneath each strap and adding tension to produce 10 mm Hg pressure. We found a significant difference (P less than .05) between prestrapping and poststrapping values for three of the four functions tested using the long spinal board: FVC (P = .0079), FEV1 (P = .0001), and FEF 25%-75% (P = .0252). Similarly significant differences were found for three of the four parameters using the Zee Extrication Device: FVC (P = .004), FEV1 (P = .0022), and FEF 25%-75% (P = .008). These differences reflect a marked pulmonary restrictive effect. The ratio FEV1:FVC can be normal or even slightly elevated with restrictive airway disease due to proportional reductions of each parameter. Correspondingly, we found no significant difference between prestrapping and poststrapping FEV1:FVC values (P greater than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-seven of the procedures were carried out by two emergency physicians initially trained on intubation manikins. A learning curve is constructed demonstrating that time to intubation is decreased after nine or ten intubations. Complications are reviewed. Bleeding occurred in 22% of patients; the technique failed in 13%. Failure to intubate with fiberoptic technique was associated with specific problems such as bleeding, tumor, or agitation. Our results demonstrate both the limitations and special use of flexible fiberoptic technique.\r"

  ".W": "Several methods of percutaneous transtracheal ventilation have been described for the immediate relief of upper airway obstruction when conventional methods fail. This study was conducted to determine whether a single percutaneously placed catheter introducer (Arrow Emergency Infusion Device [EID]) could provide access adequate for percutaneous transtracheal ventilation with standard ventilatory modalities in an obstructed airway. Ten mongrel dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and monitored (for pulse, blood pressure, ECG, and arterial blood gases). The endotracheal tube was occluded. When the dogs became hypoxic and hypercarbic, the Arrow EIDs were inserted transtracheally and the dogs were ventilated with either a Bear 1 Adult Ventilator or a Mapleson D system. Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation by the Arrow EID adequately ventilated dogs with controlled partial (95%) or complete airway obstruction from hypoxic and hypercarbic states. The ease of insertion, decreased associated complications, ability to ventilate with easily available devices, and use with complete airway obstruction make the EID an effective device for transtracheal ventilation.\r"

  ".U": "88325104\r", 
  ".W": "Capillary refill has been advocated as an indicator of perfusion status (shock) in seriously ill patients. An upper limit of normal of two seconds has been recommended; there is no published evidence that supports this value. To investigate the validity of the two-second upper limit of normal and to examine the variation of capillary refill with age and temperature, we measured capillary refill in 100 healthy child, 104 adult, and 100 elderly volunteers. In addition, 20 adults were measured before and after a one-minute immersion in 14 C water. Median capillary refill times for the young female, young male, and adult male volunteers were 0.7, 0.8, and 1.0 seconds, respectively. These times were significantly shorter than those of the adult women, elderly women, and elderly men groups, whose median times were 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 seconds, respectively. In the temperature experiment, preimmersion times were significantly shorter (median, 1.3 seconds) than those after immersion (median, 2.9 seconds) (P less than .01). We conclude that capillary refill is age and temperature dependent. Application of the two-second upper limit of normal to our populations would result in a false-positive rate of 4.0% for the pediatric and adult male volunteers, 13.7% for the adult female volunteers, and 29.0% for the elderly volunteers. The upper limit of normal for adult women should be changed to 2.9 seconds, and the upper limit of normal for the elderly should be changed to 4.5 seconds if 95% of all normal patients are to be contained within the normal range. The temperature dependence of capillary refill raises questions regarding its reliability in the prehospital setting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this retrospective study, we reviewed the cases of 143 pedestrian accident victims admitted to our trauma center during 1982 and 1983. Alcohol consumption was present in 30% of patients; 74% of them had blood alcohol levels of more than 100 mg/dL. There was a significant difference in age distribution (P less than .001); the alcohol-related accidents peaked in the 25- to 34-year-old age group, and the nonalcohol-related accidents peaked in the less than 18- and more than 55-year-old groups. Mean Injury Severity Score (25.0 vs 17.8, P less than .01) and mean length of stay (30.9 vs 17.2 days, P less than .005) were significantly greater in the patients who had consumed alcohol. Those patients with ethanol in their blood had significantly more frequent injuries to the spine (25.6% vs 10%, P less than .05) and the chest (32.6% vs 13%, P = .01). Overall mortality (11.6% vs 20%, P = .23) and mortality excluding emergency department deaths (11.6% vs 11.1%, P = .93) were not significantly different between the drinking and nondrinking groups. However, the ED mortality was higher in the nonalcohol group (0% vs 10%, P = .03). We conclude that pedestrian victims are commonly intoxicated and that chest and spine injuries are more common in this population.\r"

This will only be accomplished by attracting some of this bright young talent into full-time academic emergency medicine for research and teaching activities. Currently there are unfilled academic positions in the department at LAC/USC Medical Center and across the country in emergency medicine. This is because the salaries are not competitive, and most physicians completing their residencies with indebtedness for their education have the need of high income for a period after residency training. However, few return to academic medicine after becoming accustomed to a higher standard of living. This trend must change if we are to maintain the cutting edge of clinical emergency medicine and become the academic equivalent of the other specialties. The 12 physicians who founded ABEM, and especially the remaining six founding members who will be leaving the Board in a few days, feel honored that you selected us to serve. I am deeply grateful that you selected me to give the Kennedy Lecture, though I must admit to moments of anxiety and panic these last few weeks and days. Also, I would like to thank all the candidates for Board certification whom it was my privilege to examine during a delicate and stressful moment of their professional lives. It is really they who make the job worthwhile. Hopefully, we have laid a good foundation so that we can legitimately say the \"ball\" is yours now, \"run with it.\"\r"

Seventy five to 85 residents attended weekly scheduled seminars conducted by faculty on a wide range of surgical topics. Attendance records were kept for postgraduate years 1-5 (PGY1-PGY5) and the percentage of residents attending at all conference encounters was calculated. Individual resident ABSITE scores were pooled for each postgraduate year, and expressed as a mean (+/- standard deviation). PGY1 and PGY2 house staff attended conferences poorly (32% and 25% respectively). A marked increase to 56 per cent was noted for the PGY3 level (P less than 0.001), but failed to rise thereafter in the PGY4 and PGY5 years (56% and 52%). ABSITE scores rise with time and progressive seniority, although mean scores remain constant for given postgraduate years.

Preoperative hypotension, free rupture, venous injury, and massive transfusion were found to be associated with mortality. Interhospital transfer, preexisting coronary or pulmonary disease, known aneurysm, anemia, delay in surgery, and operative time were not found to predict outcome. Some patients are normotensive at presentation, providing an excellent chance for survival when expeditious diagnosis and treatment are carried out. Optimal operative management, complications, and causes of death are discussed. The role of computed tomography (CT) in diagnosis is considered. Elective resection of known aneurysms is the most important factor in reducing deaths from RAAA. The role of regionalization of care is unclear, since some patients cannot be safely transported. However, some evidence for optimal results in specialized centers is presented.\r"

Nineteen of twenty patients (95%) were fluid overloaded (mean 10.0L) at dialysis institution, determined by measured output over input.

There was a greater probability of operative success in women, patients over 50 years of age, and patients with hypercalcemia, hypertension, or nonspecific abdominal pain. There was no association of operative outcome with some of the \"classic\" manifestations of hyperparathyroidism--peptic ulcer disease, neuropsychiatric symptoms, pancreatitis, bone disease, or urolithiasis. The probability of surgical success improved with time, increasing from 56 per cent in the 1950s to 97 per cent in the present decade. This improvement appears to be related to greater operative experience, since all four parathyroid glands were more likely to be found with increased experience, and there was a strong correlation between finding four parathyroids and achieving persistent normocalcemia. The most common causes of operative failure were inaccurate calcium assays (the patient was not truly hypercalcemic), an inappropriate diagnosis (\"normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism\"), and surgical inexperience. These three factors accounted for at least three fourths of all negative explorations. More accurate diagnostic studies, and careful exploration by an experienced surgeon should maximize the probability of a successful operation for primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

Of the 434 study patients, 163 (38%) developed postoperative fever (38.1 degrees C [100.6 degrees F] or greater) and 26 (16%) of the febrile patients were found to have bacterial infection. Logistic-regression analysis showed that postoperative infection was associated with a WBC count of less than 5000 or greater than 10,000/mm3, a BUN of 15 mg/dl or greater, and fever onset after the second postoperative day. A predictive index, constructed from these three features, created a useful gradient for estimating the likelihood of postoperative infection. In patients with zero, one, two or three of the index features, the proportions having infection were 2 per cent (1/50), 14 per cent (12/88), 45 per cent (10/22), and 100 per cent (3/3), respectively (P less than 0.0001). This simple index, which uses readily available clinical data, may help reduce the cost of postoperative care by identifying patients with a low probability of infection in whom cultures, imaging studies, and empirical antibiotics do not appear necessary. Thorough diagnostic evaluation in patients with two or more index features may also reduce delay in the detection and treatment of postoperative infection. The predictive value of this index should be validated in a new patient set, however, before widespread application of the index is warranted.\r"

About three quarters of these patients report in addition to dull inguinal pain, intermittent neuralgic pain and in almost two thirds of the patients a pin-prick hyperalgesia of the skin corresponding to the ilio-inguinal nerve can be demonstrated. It is also typical that all patients experience a distinct tenderness upon palpation over the deep inguinal ring during Valsalva's maneuvre. It is important to keep this condition in mind, especially since the patients respond well to surgical treatment.\r"

We describe the clinical features of four patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex who developed angiomatous nodules involving skin and bone, 2 of whom were scratched by a cat. Some of these lesions were clinically indistinguishable from Kaposi sarcoma. When examined with Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy, these nodules were noted to contain numerous clumps of a bacterium. Immunoperoxidase staining with an antiserum raised against the cat-scratch disease bacillus stained these organisms in all patients. Cat-scratch disease is usually a self-limited infection, but complicated or prolonged infections have been described in both normal and immunocompromised hosts. In our patients infected with HIV, manifestations of systemic cat-scratch disease included angiomatous nodules, severe systemic symptoms of fever, chills, night sweats and weight loss, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and decreased hematocrit. Cutaneous lesions involved the face, trunk, and extremities and numbered 2 to greater than 60; osseous lesions involved the fibula, radius, femur, and tibia, and were present in two of four patients. Treatment with x-ray therapy, intralesional vinblastine, penicillin, dicloxacillin, cephradine, and nafcillin had no effect on any lesions; however, treatment with erythromycin, doxycycline, or antimycobacterial antibiotics resulted in complete and rapid resolution of the cutaneous and osseous lesions, and the accompanying signs and symptoms of systemic infection. In patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, angiomatous nodules should be carefully evaluated for the presence of this organism, which can be treated and cured with antibiotic agents.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the hemodynamic correlates of a modified abdominojugular reflux test. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Referral-based cardiology practice in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Two consecutive samples of 65 (group 1) and 21 (group 2) patients having both right and left heart catheterization. INTERVENTIONS: Ten seconds of firm midabdominal pressure was applied by hand in all patients. In group 1 patients, right atrial pressures were recorded during this maneuver. In group 2 patients, simultaneous right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures were recorded during this maneuver. In group 2 patients, this abdominojugular test was also done at the bedside before cardiac catheterization by observing the changes in the jugular venous pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Positive results on an abdominojugular test, defined as an increase in the right atrial pressure during 10 seconds of firm midabdominal compression followed by an abrupt drop in pressure of at least 3 mm Hg (4 cm of blood) on pressure release, were found in patients who as a group had hemodynamic evidence of left ventricular failure. The patients with a positive response had lower left ventricular ejection fractions and stroke volumes, and higher left ventricular filling, higher mean pulmonary arterial, and higher right atrial pressures. The pulmonary arterial occluded or wedge pressures provided the clearest separation between patients with and without a positive response. The mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure was 10.5 +/- 1 mm Hg in patients with a negative response and 19 +/- 3 mm Hg in patients with a positive response (P less than 0.001). In all but one of the group 2 patients, miabdominal pressure produced similar directional changes in both the right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures. CONCLUSIONS: The abdominojugular test, when done in a standardized fashion, correlates best with the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, and therefore, is probably a reflection of an increased central blood volume. In the absence of isolated right ventricular failure, seen in some patients with right ventricular infarction, a positive abdominojugular test suggests a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or greater.\r"

PATIENTS: Ten consecutive male patients with AIDS. INTERVENTION: Maximal acid output was determined after pentagastrin stimulation in all patients. Serum ketoconazole levels were measured the day after ingestion of a 200-mg ketoconazole tablet in the fasted state. On the final day, ketoconazole was ingested with 200 mL of 0.1-N hydrochloric acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Maximal acid output was below 15 mEq/h in 7 of 10 patients. In all 7, the area under the serum ketoconazole concentration-time curve was below normal (1.4 +/- 0.9 mg/h.L; mean +/- SE), and absorption was normalized by hydrochloric acid (9.9 +/- mg/h.L). Two of three patients with maximal acid outputs above 15 mEq/h had normal ketoconazole absorption (15.1 +/- 6.7 mg/h.L). CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of oral ketoconazole is reduced in patients with AIDS, largely as a result of gastric hypochlorhydria. Ketoconazole tablets should therefore be given with acid in these patients.\r"

Five patients were excluded from analysis because intraoperative technical difficulties precluded exposure of the pituitary gland. The selection of candidates for transsphenoidal exploration was based on endocrinologic criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging was the preferred radiologic test. Selective venous sampling of adrenocorticotropic hormone further refined the diagnosis when endocrinologic and radiologic procedures were not definitive. Remission of disease was achieved in 164 of 216 (76%) patients analyzed (95% CI, 69 to 81). Among patients with histologic confirmation of adenomas, the percentage having remission was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in patients with microadenomas than in patients with macroadenomas and in patients with intrasellar adenomas than in patients with extrasellar extension of their adenoma or perforation of the sellar floor by adenoma (P less than 0.001). Five patients had an ectopic source of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. Two patients had diffuse pituitary hyperplasia. Complications occurred in 9.3% of the patients, including two deaths that were apparently unrelated to surgery (CI, 5.4 to 13). The results indicate that transsphenoidal surgery is the preferred treatment for most patients with Cushing disease.\r"

Two hundred and thirty-seven ET patients (137 in London and 100 in Chicago) were evaluated. One hundred patients with PD and 100 normal control subjects were also investigated. Mild extrapyramidal signs occurred in only 4.5% of ET patients and were consistent with those found in normal aging. Only 3% of PD patients gave a history of uncomplicated ET. There was no difference in the frequency of a family history of PD between ET patients, a group of PD patients, and control subjects. Frequency of a family history of ET was higher among PD patients than control subjects, although the difference was not statistically significant. These data indicate that there is no association or genetic link between ET and PD.\r"

The patients, 10 male and 10 female, ranged in age from 12 to 77 years (mean 44) and had a mean duration of symptoms of 22 months. All had signs of optic nerve dysfunction. Each patient was studied with MRI using a short TI inversion recovery (STIR) sequence to delineate the optic nerve from surrounding orbital tissue. Three distinct groups of patients with CUON were identified using MRI. In the first group (8/20) the optic nerve was compressed by an extrinsic mass, whereas in the second group (5/20) CUON resulted from an intrinsic tumor of the optic nerve or sheath. In both groups STIR sequences compared favorably with computed tomography in identifying mass lesions. MRI was superior in delineating distortion of the optic nerve by mass or tumor extension beyond the orbit. In the third group (7/20) no mass was evident on MRI. However, STIR sequences revealed altered signal (long T1) in clinically symptomatic nerves. In 4 of the patients T2-weighted cerebral MRI disclosed periventricular lesions suggestive of disseminated white matter disease. We conclude that MRI complements clinical and electrophysiological testing in the assessment of CUON.\r"

In the absence of primary sensory deficits, these 6 patients showed a lack of withdrawal and absent or inadequate emotional responses to painful stimuli applied over the entire body, as well as to threatening gestures. Five patients also failed to react to verbal menaces. Patients appeared unconcerned about the defect and seemed unable to learn appropriate escape or protective responses. Common associated abnormalities were rapidly resolving hemiparesis, cortical-type sensory loss, unilateral neglect, and body-schema disorders. Neuroradiological examination disclosed left hemispheric lesions in 4 patients and right hemispheric involvement in 2. Although lesion extension differed, the insular cortex was invariably damaged in all 6 patients. These findings suggest that insular damage may play a critical role in the development of the syndrome by interrupting connections between sensory cortices and the limbic system.\r"

The brains were received consecutively over a 3-year period from numerous sources as part of a research program in which one brain half was frozen for biochemical studies and the other half was fixed in formalin. One hundred thirty-one (87%) of the 150 cases fulfilled histological criteria for AD, with or without additional findings, such as Parkinson's disease or stroke. At least a minimal degree of amyloid angiopathy was found in every brain showing histopathological abnormalities of AD. Twenty-three (18%) of the 131 AD brains had Lewy bodies in neurons of the substantia nigra. Thirteen of the 19 non-AD cases were diagnosed as other neurodegenerative disorders. In only 2 cases was no histological correlate for the patient's dementia found. We conclude that (1) the many physicians who diagnosed these cases did so highly accurately; (2) degenerative changes in the substantia nigra were more common in patients with AD than has been reported for the general aged population; (3) amyloid angiopathy was a constant accompaniment of AD, although its severity varied widely; (4) vascular dementia was rarely clinically misdiagnosed as AD; (5) neuropathological findings were insufficient to account for the clinical syndrome of dementia in less than 2% of cases; (6) the histological criteria established by the National Institutes of Health/American Association of Retired Persons Workshop on the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease worked well in assessing this large series.\r"

Immunostaining of adjacent sections for S-100 beta protein, a specific Schwann cell marker, suggested that Schwann cells expressed the NGF receptors induced by axonal degeneration. Residual Schwann cells in nerves in which axons were completely depleted also expressed NGF receptors. NGF receptors were not detected in relation to thinly myelinated regenerating axons, nor were they detected in the endoneurium of nerves that had undergone segmental demyelination and remyelination. The increased expression of NGF receptors in human axonal neuropathies may contribute to regeneration by NGF-responsive neurons in these disorders.\r"

We report 11 patients with HIV-associated myopathy. Five patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 2 with AIDS-related complex, and 4 otherwise asymptomatic HIV-infected patients developed progressive proximal muscle weakness. Serum creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated and electromyography revealed abnormal spontaneous activity and myopathy in most patients. All 8 muscle biopsy specimens showed fiber necrosis. Four had inflammatory infiltrates, and nemaline rod bodies were prominent in 3. Immunosuppressant therapy in 5 patients resulted in improvement. Attempts at viral localization in 4 muscle biopsy specimens were unsuccessful. These findings suggest a distinct association between HIV infection and myopathy with features atypical for polymyositis.\r"

Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of age, protein binding, and renal function on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous vancomycin was evaluated in 37 adult patients with various degrees of renal function. Patients were categorized into three groups based on measured creatinine clearance (CLCR): groups 1, 2, and 3 had 24-h CLCRs of greater than 70, 40 to 70, and 10 to 39 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. After 1 h of intravenous infusion, concentrations of vancomycin in serum declined in a biexponential manner in all patients. Diminished renal function in groups 2 and 3 was accompanied by a lower total body vancomycin clearance (CL) (52.6 and 31.3, respectively, versus 98.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and a lower renal vancomycin clearance (CLR) (48.2 and 19.8, respectively, versus 88.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2) than in group 1. No significant differences in apparent distribution volume of the central compartment or apparent distribution volume at steady state were observed. Mean serum protein binding of vancomycin was 30% and was not significantly affected by renal function. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that CLCR was the strongest predictor of vancomycin CL (r = 0.77, P less than 0.001) and vancomycin CLR (r = 0.87, P less than 0.001). Age did not significantly improve these correlations once CLCR was included. The relationship of vancomycin CL and CLCR was utilized to develop the following equation to dose vancomycin in the majority of renally impaired patients: dose (milligrams per kilogram per 24 h) = 0.227CLCR + 5.67, where CLCR is standardized to milliliters per minute per 70 kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prothrombin times were measured in moxalactam-treated patients, and patients treated with clindamycin plus gentamicin had urinalyses and blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine determinations performed before and after treatment. Also, gentamicin levels in serum were determined as clinically indicated. A satisfactory treatment response was defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms of endomyometritis within 3 days of the start of antibiotic therapy.

The marked hydrophobicity and water insolubility of this compound may be a factor for this disparity. To overcome this handicap, we incorporated enviroxime into liposomes and then tested the antirhinovirus activity and toxicity of the liposome-incorporated enviroxime (LE) in cell culture and studied its administration by small-particle aerosol. Free enviroxime and LE were found to have equivalent efficacies against rhinovirus strains 1A and 13 in in vitro assays; however, preparations of LE were 10- to greater than or equal to 50-fold less toxic to tissue culture cells than was free enviroxime. In contrast to free enviroxime, which could not be delivered by small-particle aerosol because of its water insolubility, LE (4 mg/ml) was readily and successfully delivered by small-particle aerosol to the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice; after just 20 min, significant levels of enviroxime were detected in the lungs and noses of exposed mice. Moreover, mice exposed to aerosols of liposomes containing both enviroxime and fluorescein isothiophosphatidylethanolamine showed accumulations of the fluorescent marker in the lungs, particularly in or around the tall columnar epithelial cells lining the bronchi and bronchioles.\r"

Among the compounds evaluated, pyrazofurin, 3-deazaguanine, ribavirin, carbodine, and cyclopentenyl cytosine inhibited viral cytopathogenicity at concentrations that were lower than those found cytotoxic for the MDCK cells. No differences were observed in the 50% effective doses (based on inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity) of these five compounds for a number of influenza virus type A (subtypes H1N1 and H3N2), B, and C strains. Pyrazofurin showed the lowest 50% effective dose (0.15 microgram/ml), which was about 20- to 30-fold lower than those of the other four compounds. The selectivity indices of the five compounds, calculated as the ratio of the 50% cytotoxic dose (determined by trypan blue exclusion) to the 50% effective dose, were greater than 100. When the selectivity indices were calculated as the ratios of the 50% inhibitory doses for cellular RNA synthesis to the 50% effective doses, they were greater than 100 for ribavirin, pyrazofurin, and 3-deazaguanine but less than 2 for carbodine and cyclopentenyl cytosine. All five compounds inhibited the growth of influenza virus types A and B in MDCK cells at a concentration which was well below their cytotoxicity threshold for MDCK cells and, therefore, deserve further exploration for their potential in the treatment of influenza virus type A, B, and C infections.\r"

  ".W": "The protective effect of piperacillin against the nephrotoxicity of cephaloridine and gentamicin was examined in experimental animals. In rabbits, piperacillin was infused at a dose of 1 mg/kg (body weight) per min over 225 min and cephaloridine (300 mg/kg) was intravenously administered as a bolus 45 min after the start of a drip infusion. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in urine were measured as the renal toxicological parameters before and 24 h after cephaloridine dosing. Although the single administration of cephaloridine significantly elevated these parameters, the elevation was prevented by the concomitant administration of piperacillin. The protective effect of piperacillin was superior to those of cephalothin and fosfomycin. In rats, piperacillin (1,000 mg/kg) was intravenously administered and immediately followed by the intramuscular administration of gentamicin (100 mg/kg) every 24 h for 5 days. When piperacillin was concomitantly administered with gentamicin, the elevations of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urinary NAG were significantly lower than when gentamicin was given alone. The concomitant administration of piperacillin resulted in a significant protective effect against the nephrotoxicity of cephaloridine in rabbits and of gentamicin in rats. Histopathological observation also supported the protective effect of piperacillin. The protective mechanism of piperacillin might be the inhibition of transport from the peritubular side to tubular cells for cephaloridine and from both the peritubular and luminal sides for gentamicin.\r"

The subjects received a single 40-mg/kg (body weight) (approximately equal to 3-g) calcium fosfomycin dose and a 25-mg/kg (approximately equal to 2-g) tromethamine fosfomycin dose in fosfomycin acid form. Blood and urine samples were collected for 24 h. Antibiotic concentrations in serum and urine were measured by microbiological assay. In all subjects, the peak levels of the calcium salt in serum were two- to fourfold lower than those of the tromethamine salt (6 to 7 and 18 to 22 micrograms/ml, respectively), indicating poor intestinal absorption of the calcium form. The elimination half-life of the two oral forms was about 5 h in young adults, and the half-life was only moderately longer in elderly subjects, with large individual variations: 8.28 +/- 5.51 h for tromethamine fosfomycin and 11.80 +/- 6.86 h for calcium fosfomycin. In elderly subjects, absorption of the tromethamine salt form was not modified, but the time to peak level was delayed for the calcium salt (2.58 +/- 0.54 h versus 1.41 +/- 0.67 h in young adults). Pharmacokinetic elimination of the two forms of fosfomycin was only moderately affected in elderly subjects; we observed lower urinary elimination, about 58 versus 28% of the dose in 24-h urines for the tromethamine salt and decreased renal clearance of both forms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

More than 4,000 patients have been treated with this antibiotic, but increased serum creatinine levels were noted in 18 cases. In 5 of these cases, apalcillin was possibly responsible, and in 13 it was doubtful. We decided to study renal function of normal volunteers treated with 4 g of apalcillin. Three periods were studied: a pretreatment control period of 80 min followed by a treatment period of 60 min and a posttreatment period of 40 min. Inulin and p-aminohippurate (PAH) infusion were continued during all three periods. At the beginning of the treatment period, 2 g of apalcillin was injected as a bolus, followed by infusion of 2 g of apalcillin over 1 h. Urinary volume was measured every 20 min. Creatinine, insulin, and PAH clearances and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were calculated for each period. Urinary beta-2-microglobulin excretion was also assessed. Analysis of variance was done. We observed no variation in clearances of creatinine or inulin or in urinary electrolyte output. PAH clearance was significantly decreased during apalcillin infusion. Apalcillin appeared to compete with PAH for proximal tubular secretion but induced no further renal dysfunction.\r"

Using three-dimensional computer-aided reconstruction it was demonstrated that the follicle form determines the hair form, eg, the Negroid follicle has a helical form, whereas that of the Oriental follicle is completely straight. The caucasoid follicle represent variation between these extremes. However, even a straight caucasoid follicle may produce a hair shaft that has an oval cross section.\r"

In contrast to the complement allotypes, which showed no deviation from the distribution in the normal population, two HLA class II antigens occurred in much higher frequency in patients with EM. The frequency of HLA-DQw3 (77.4%) increased with high significance compared with normal Caucasian control individuals (41.2%). An even stronger DQw3 association was found in the patient group with postherpetic EM (88.8%; relative risk, 9.41). Interestingly, all patients suffering from frequently recurrent EM were found to have the DQw3 allele (relative risk 44.2). The previously reported association to HLA-B15 was also seen and may be due to a linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-DR4 allele (66.6% in recurrent EM). Our data provide further evidence that classic recurrent EM is related to herpes simplex virus infection and should be regarded as a distinct entity within the enigmatic EM syndrome. DQw3 may serve as a helpful marker for distinguishing this entity from other diseases with EM-like lesions.\r"

The mean (+/- SEM) iron concentration in the skin around the venous ulcer was elevated, compared with control values of nonulcerated skin (250 +/- 54 vs 128 +/- 39 micrograms) and compared with normal skin from the forearm (250 +/- 54 vs 14 +/- 2.5 micrograms). These data suggest that dermal iron deposition may not be an incidental by-product of increased venous pressure, but may actively perpetuate tissue damage in venous ulcerations.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TCPO2) is an established and noninvasive way of assessing cutaneous hypoxia. Since the degree of oxygenation modulates fibroblast growth and synthesis, we investigated the presence of cutaneous hypoxia in patients with systemic sclerosis (SS). We measured TCPO2 of the involved skin of the dorsal aspect of the forearm in 33 patients with SS and 16 control individuals (normal subjects and patients with Raynaud's disease). The degree of forearm skin thickness was assessed clinically as mild, moderate, or severe. The TCPO2 measurements were obtained at a sensor temperature of 44 degrees C, which causes maximal vasodilation and eliminates the variables associated with vascular tone. Measurements were recorded while patients were breathing room air or 31% oxygen delivered by a Ventimask system (Baxter Healthcare, Ocala, Fla). We also measured the TCPO2 of the medial aspect of the arm when this site was uninvolved. We found that sclerodermatous skin is hypoxic when compared with the uninvolved skin of patients with SS or control individuals. The TCPO2 values were indirectly related to skin thickness; thus, patients whose skin was severely thickened had the lowest TCPO2 values. There was no correlation of TCPO2 values with pulmonary function tests or arterial oxygen pressure. The TCPO2 levels of patients with Raynaud's disease did not differ from other control individuals. The administration of oxygen increased TCPO2 readings in patients with SS to normal values. We conclude that the thickened skin of patients with SS is hypoxic and suggest that TCPO2 measurements may be helpful in objectively assessing the degree of skin thickness. The hypoxia demonstrated in SS skin may play a role in the modulation of dermal fibroblast proliferation and synthetic activity.\r"

A neonate developing purpura fulminans with internal thrombotic complications and congenital absence of protein C is described. Family studies showed partial protein C deficiency in the subject's symptom-free parents and two of three siblings. Clinically and histopathologically similar lesions are also seen in two acquired conditions in which there is a thrombotic tendency: coumarin necrosis and purpura fulminans of childhood, both of which are probably the result of transient protein C deficiency. We conclude that purpura fulminans can represent a cutaneous marker of acquired or congenital protein C deficiency.\r"

In another case, two subsequent keratoacanthomas developed in adjacent skin. There were no further recurrences after follow-up periods of 7, 24, 42, and 44 months. Lesions in two patients were extremely painful. Perineural invasion was found in each of nine pathologic specimens. The number of involved nerves in single sections of each lesion ranged from two to 59 and exceeded 20 in four specimens from three patients. Intravenous growth by keratoacanthoma was seen in five specimens from three patients. Nine veins were affected in one instance and four in another. Several of the tumors had a dispersed and deeply infiltrative pattern of growth. Measuring vertically from the surface of the lesion, the deepest focus of perineural invasion observed in the four patients ranged from 4.2 to 17 mm. Keratoacanthomas with this unusual constellation of findings may have a predilection for the central portion of the face.\r"

To determine the possible efficacy of this drug in junctional forms of this disease, we treated four children (two with generalized atrophic benign EB [GABEB] and two with Herlitz disease) with two 16- to 20-week treatment periods with phenytoin separated by an eight- to 12-week drug-free period. Phenytoin was administered to achieve serum levels similar to those previously proved effective in treating recessive dystrophic EB. Serial counts were made of lesions (blisters, crusts, and erosions); surface areas of granulation tissue, when present, were also serially measured. In addition, changes in the percentage of surface area involved with scarring as well as changes in extracutaneous disease activity were similarly assessed. Both patients with GABEB showed excellent response during each course of phenytoin, with average reductions in lesion counts of 70% and 38%. In addition, subjectively, the healing times also appeared to be reduced. During the \"wash-out\" period, total lesional counts returned toward pretreatment levels. Both patients with GABEB subsequently have received phenytoin for an additional two years off of protocol, with continued excellent response. In contrast, the conditions of both patients with the Herlitz variant worsened while taking phenytoin, with increases in overall lesional counts of 31% and 72%. Also, the surface areas of exuberant granulation tissue either remained unchanged or increased during the course of phenytoin treatment. We conclude that phenytoin is effective in at least some patients with the GABEB subset of junctional EB, whereas no efficacy has been noted in patients with the more severe Herlitz variant.\r"

Circumstances leading to admissions were examined in a prospective study over a one year period. There were 605 admissions, 437 (72%) were self referrals.

In the 25 children who responded to pancreozymin stimulation the mean faecal chymotrypsin concentration was significantly positively correlated with the apparent chymotrypsin secretion rate. Correlation using single specimen stools collected at random was appreciably poorer. In the five children with undetectable or only traces of chymotrypsin in the duodenum after stimulation, the mean faecal chymotrypsin concentrations were only 3-10% of the lower limit of the reference interval. In a second group of 46 children with cystic fibrosis proved by sweat tests and clinical evidence of malabsorption, the chymotrypsin concentration measured in a single stool specimen collected at random was unequivocally subnormal in each case. Faecal chymotrypsin measurement is a rapid, simple, cheap, readily repeated, non-invasive test of high specificity and sensitivity. Faecal chymotrypsin should be measured before contemplating intraduodenal tests of pancreatic function.\r"

It was, however, still considerable, the average range of carbohydrate intake over three days being 51 g. The variation in carbohydrate intake was not related to diabetic control nor to the families' knowledge of diabetes. Compliance with the dietary prescription deteriorated during the day. These findings support a qualitative approach to the dietary prescriptions for diabetics.\r"

Results obtained within two weeks of birth for liveborn infants were used to establish bone mineral deposition curves approximating normal in utero development. Results for stillborn infants indicated a retardation of bone mineralisation relative to liveborn infants. This has important implications concerning previous estimates of daily calcium needs for preterm infants. Eleven liveborn Asian singletons and nine pairs of white twins were examined similarly. With respect to bone mineral content, weight, and crown-heel length, Asians with gestational ages over 35 weeks and twins were closely comparable with their white singleton peers. Asians under 35 weeks tended to be smaller than white singletons of comparable age.\r"

Two thirds of the patients had their first urinary tract infection during the first three months of life, and boys were significantly younger. There was a predominance of boys from 1-3 months old, but of girls thereafter. Obstructive uropathies occurred more often in boys, and during the first two months of life. The incidence of vesicoureteric reflux was similar for both sexes. Malformations recognised after urinary tract infections were compared with urinary tract malformations recognised prenatally. Fetal urinary tracts were evaluated in just over half of all pregnancies during the study period. Obstructive uropathies and multicystic dysplastic kidneys were more often diagnosed prenatally, and most refluxes were diagnosed after the urinary tract infection. In conclusion age and sex differences are common in urinary tract infection, and even though many urinary tract malformations were diagnosed prenatally this did not influence the high incidence of malformations recognised after urinary tract infection in infancy.\r"

Disruption of family life was most common in families with the more severely ill children (on hospital haemodialysis) and there was a tendency for more mental health problems in the parents in this group. Although more of these parents reported that the child's illness had had an impact on the marriage, marital break up was not related to illness status. There were indications that illness had resulted in an increase of subjective stress but also of support in a number of psychosocial areas for parents, especially those in the more severely affected group. Nevertheless at the time of assessment, fewer mothers in this group were deriving support from their social life and fewer fathers of ill children from their jobs or finances.\r"

There were no significant differences in the incidences of leakage of dialysate, two way obstruction, bleeding, or peritonitis. Among those who had Trocath catheters there were significantly more episodes of outflow obstruction, and significantly more patients required two or more catheter insertions (12 of 33 compared with one of 34 among those who had Tenckhoff catheters). Furthermore, more catheters were removed because of complications (19 of 33 compared with five of 34 respectively). One patient who had a Tenckhoff catheter died of peritonitis directly related to insertion of the catheter. Overall, the Tenckhoff catheter was associated with fewer complications and is recommended for most patients.\r"

Although comparable proportions of case and comparison patients had taken antipyretics in the three weeks before admission, a significant excess of cases (59% compared with 26% in the comparisons) had been given aspirin, whereas significantly more comparison children (49% compared with 25% in the cases) had taken paracetamol. There was an excess exposure to aspirin in children under 5 years of age; the excess observed in older patients just failed to reach significance. Separate analyses within Northern Ireland and England also showed a case-comparison difference. A significant correlation was shown between aspirin (but not paracetamol) exposure and the closeness with which cases conformed to the diagnostic criteria of Reye's syndrome, measured by an artibrary score. The many difficulties of conducting and interpreting the findings of an epidemiological risk factor study of an association between aspirin and Reye's syndrome are reviewed and emphasised. Inherent biases were present in this as in previous studies and it did not conform to the classical case-control design. Nevertheless the findings suggested that an association between Reye's syndrome and preadmission aspirin may exist in some children.\r"

There was a mild increase in frequency dependence of total respiratory resistance in children who suffered from lung injury in early life, which indicates uneven ventilation in peripheral airways. Bronchial responsiveness to histamine in these subjects was normal. No abnormalities were found in the control group.

There was no significant difference in maximum intracranial pressures between patients with a good outcome and those with a poor one, but patients with a poor outcome had significantly lower minimum cerebral perfusion pressures. During the period of admission 18 patients had cardiovascular failure, none had renal failure, and two developed severe coagulopathy. Seventeen of the 19 patients in whom at least one of these systems failed died. Our findings emphasise the diversity of illnesses associated with raised intracranial pressure in children and the number who develop multiple organ failure, and the values and limitations of using minimum cerebral perfusion pressure and the organ system failure scores as guides to severity of illness and prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Forty eight comatose children had electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded during the acute phase of their illnesses. These were classified according to a simple grading system and the findings correlated with the presence of seizures, deep coma, minimum cerebral perfusion pressure, and eventual neurological outcome. Serial EEGs proved important, particularly when slow activity was seen initially. None of the 20 patients who showed low amplitude EEG activity or electrocerebral silence at any stage of the acute illness did well. Discharges were seen in only 13 of the 29 patients with seizures and their presence did not correlate with outcome except in five patients with a distinctive pattern of discharges, none of whom had a good outcome. EEG findings associated with poor outcome did not always correlate with the clinical assessment of deep coma, emphasising the difficulties of neurological evaluation in these patients. Five of the patients with cerebral perfusion pressures greater than 42 mm Hg had a poor outcome that was predicted by serial EEGs. In nine patients with a minimum cerebral perfusion pressure in the borderline range 38-42 mm Hg the EEG was useful as an indication of the outcome. The EEG reflects changes in cerebral function which may be due to multifactorial or repeated insults. An EEG is therefore important in both the initial assessment and as an indicator of the neurological outcome, particularly in those patients in whom the cerebral perfusion pressure has apparently been adequate or within the borderline range.\r"

The airway responsiveness to histamine was significantly related to a history of asthma in first degree relatives (natural parents and siblings) in both groups of children, but not to that of the mothers. There was no increase in the prevalence of maternal asthma, a family history of asthma, or airway responsiveness in the mothers of low birthweight children. We were unable to find evidence to support the hypothesis that maternal smooth muscle irritability (uterine and airway) has a causative role in the premature labour in the mothers and in subsequent bronchial hyper-responsiveness in their prematurely born children.\r"

Twenty of the 24 infants (83%) thrived well on cows' milk protein. Jejunal biopsy specimens taken six to eight weeks after the initial biopsy showed histological improvement in all 20 infants compared with biopsy specimens taken soon after the challenge, which had shown mucosal damage. The mucosa had returned to normal in 12, was mildly abnormal in seven, and moderately abnormal in one. Corresponding improvements in the activities of mucosal enzymes were seen. In four of the 24 infants (17%) symptoms developed between three and six weeks. Histological examination of the jejunal biopsy specimens showed that mucosal damage had progressed in two, and remained the same in two; moreover, the disaccharidase activities remained depressed. The present study shows that most infants with enteropathy caused by sensitivity to cows' milk protein but without clinical symptoms develop tolerance to the protein and the mucosa returns to normal despite continued feeding with cows' milk protein.\r"

The incidence in previous siblings was 10 times that expected, in second degree relatives five times, and in third degree relatives four times that expected for the community. The minimum incidence in the next subsequent sibling was five times that expected. Except for one family in which both twins died during the same night, the surviving twin has never died (23 infants). The incidence of SIDS in adopted infants was similar to the incidence in natural born infants. Families in which two or more siblings died from SIDS differed from families in which only one infant died from SIDS in several ways. More infants were over 12 months old, and the mothers had an increased incidence of previous miscarriage and threatened miscarriage during the pregnancy with the infant who died. In one family both infants had bronchomalacia, and two families were severely socially deprived. For most families (92%) in which an infant died from SIDS the risk of recurrence is small (less that twice the expected risk). We have identified a small subgroup (8%) with a significantly increased risk of recurrence.\r"

As part of a study on teenage pregnancy, where 137 women were interviewed, 46 men were also interviewed. They were less likely to have had teaching about sex from parents and were subject to less parental supervision than the women. Both sexes had had similar experience of school sex education. Just under half of the men started having intercourse before 16 years. Over half of both sexes were initiated by an experienced partner and for 15/25 (60%) of the men this was within the first month of a relationship. Most men had had several partners and 27/99 (27%) of teenage women at least three, most in the context of stable relationships. 'Serial monogamy' exposes each partner indirectly to their partners previous partners (with the associated medical risks). Education must help teenagers make decisions about sexual involvement that take account of these facts and the implications for their own future health and happiness.\r"

Surprisingly little ill effect from a sibling death (occurring either before or after the birth of study children) was apparent at the age of 5 years. Families experiencing a stillbirth or death of a child were socially disadvantaged. Even allowing for this and other likely intervening factors, however, a child whose adjacent sibling had died was significantly more liable to bronchitis or wheezing during the first 5 years. Mothers who had experienced the death of a child since the study child's birth had high scores on a psychological screening test, and were more likely to be single parents. Mothers who had lost a child were more likely to smoke during the next pregnancy. No significant differences between cases and control subjects were detected on other health, behavioural, or developmental outcomes. Stillbirth or death of a child appears to have little measurable effect on siblings assessed at 5 years of age. This study does not exclude important longer term psychological effects from sibling death.\r"

Fourteen (74%) complained of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms consistent with solvent exposure, including lightheadedness, fatigue, increased sleep requirement, and headache. The majority of these symptoms resolved with transfer from the plant. Men working less than 1 yr at Plant A were more likely to complain of two or more CNS symptoms than men who were working there longer than 1 yr (p = .055). Objective abnormalities in neurobehavioral testing were found in all 4 men working longer than 9 yr at this plant, but in only 5 of 15 employed there for a shorter period (p = .03). These results are consistent with the known effects of solvent exposure. Occupational health personnel must be aware that STWs can be exposed to solvents and other industrial wastes.\r"

The results of a prior study showed that persons exposed to TCDD had depressed cell-mediated immunity, and 18 of 51 persons had anergy or relative anergy on skin testing. This paper presents the results of a medical follow-up on participants who were reported to be anergic or relatively anergic in the earlier study. None of the participants in the follow-up study was anergic, and only one exposed and one unexposed participant were relatively anergic. Several technical and biological possibilities for the difference in results of the two studies are presented. The possibility that recovery from the effects of TCDD exposure caused the differing results is the least plausible explanation for the changes in the skin test results.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms due to long-term exposure to ambient levels of total oxidants and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), symptoms were ascertained using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) respiratory symptoms questionnaire. A total of 7,445 Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) nonsmokers who were 25 yr of age or older and had resided at least 11 yr in areas of California with high to low photochemical air pollution were included in this study. Cumulative exposures to each pollutant in excess of four thresholds were estimated for each participant, using zip codes for months of residence and interpolated dosages from state air-monitoring stations. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted individually and together for pollutants and included eight covariables, including passive smoking. A statistically significant association with chronic symptoms was seen for total oxidants above 10 pphm (196 mcg/m3) (p less than .004, relative risk of 1.20 for 750 hr/yr). Chronic respiratory disease symptoms were not associated with relatively low NO2 exposure levels in this population. When these pollutant exposures were studied with exposures to total suspended particulates (TSP) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), only TSP exposure above 200 mcg/m3 showed statistical significance (p less than .01). Exposure to TSP is either more strongly associated with symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than the other measured exposures or is the best single surrogate representing the mix of pollutants present.\r"

No differences were observed in serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), secretory IgA in saliva, and complement component C3.

Subsequently, 55 workers who were occupationally exposed to tetrachloroethylene in eight commercial dry cleaning facilities were studied (median value, 66 mg/m3; geometric standard deviation, 3.15 mg/m3). In both the experimentally exposed subjects and occupationally exposed workers the urinary concentration of tetrachloroethylene showed a linear relationship to the corresponding environmental time-weighted average concentration. The findings indicate that the urinary concentration of tetrachloroethylene can be used as an appropriate biological exposure indicator. In occupationally exposed subjects performing moderate work, the urinary tetrachloroethylene concentration corresponding to the time-weighted average of the threshold limit value proved to be 120 mcg/L and its 95% lower confidence limit (biological threshold) 100 mcg/L. The effects of workload on the tetrachloroethylene urinary elimination are also accounted for.\r"

Mineralizing by using small amounts of nitric acid, ion exchange separation, and electrothermal atomic absorption measurements are the techniques used. The normal content of cobalt is 8.5 nmol/L (range 1.7-20.4 nmol/L) in blood and 6.8 nmol/L (range 1.7-37.3 nmol/L) in urine in a nonoccupational cobalt-exposed group. After exposure, cobalt is excreted rapidly in urine. When exposure is relatively high, there is rapid continuous decrease in excretion for about 24 hr followed by a slower excretion phase. When exposure is low, the excretion of cobalt in urine is relatively constant but may be 4-10 times higher than in non-exposed persons. The slow excretion can continue at least 4 wk after exposure. Variations of cobalt concentrations in blood are smaller but follow the exposure. When blood and urine concentrations of cobalt were compared on a Friday afternoon, the correlation coefficient was 0.82. When the average exposure to cobalt for the whole week was compared with the cobalt concentration in urine, the correlation coefficient on Friday afternoon was 0.79 and on Monday morning 0.81. For blood, the correlation coefficient was 0.87 on Friday afternoon and 0.76 on Monday morning.\r"

In this paper, the design considerations and Phase I results of a human exposure study focused on Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are discussed. This study site, located in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, is a city that contains a metal pipe foundry, which is a suspected major source of BaP. Three outdoor PM-10 samplers (used to collect BaP-containing particles with an aerodynamic size of less than or equal to 10 micron) were located in residential areas surrounding the foundry. Ten homes were sampled indoors for PM-10. Some homes have indoor combustion sources, e.g., cigarette smoke or a coal burning stove. The indoor and outdoor samples were 24 hr in duration. The mean outdoor concentration of BaP was 0.9 ng/m3, and the indoor concentrations ranged from 0.1-8.1 ng/m3. Food samples were acquired from family meals each day. They represented a one-third portion of each meal eaten at home. The range of BaP per gram of wet weight of food was between 0.004 and 1.2 ng/g. Of the 20 wk of exposure (10 x 2 wk), 10 had higher food exposures and the other 10 had higher inhalation exposures. Of the two groups, the higher food exposures usually had a greater number of ng of BaP/wk. The dominance of one or the other pathway appeared to depend upon personal eating habits and indoor combustion source use. In some instances, outdoor air pollution led to a major portion of indoor air BaP exposures. Water appears to be a minor source of BaP exposures in the study area.\r"

The mean age of the AS group was 75.4 years (range, 70 to 88 years) and of the AS + CAD group, 74.8 years (range, 70 to 86 years). The mean aortic valve gradient in the AS group was 87.7 +/- 30.6 mm Hg and in the AS + CAD group, 68.0 +/- 51.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Hospital mortality for the AS group was 12.1% (13 patients) and for the AS + CAD group, 8.9% (10 patients). The long-term survival at seven years was 77.2 +/- 5.5% (+/- the standard error of the mean) for the AS group and 57.0 +/- 6.9% for the AS + CAD group (p less than 0.006). Postoperative assessment reveals substantial functional improvement. These early and long-term favorable results provide a much needed reference point when valvuloplasty is being considered. Aortic valve replacement is the treatment of choice in elderly patients with symptomatic AS.\r"

Cumulative patient follow-up was 491 patient-years (average, 4.3 years per patient). Hospital mortality was 18% and 19% for patients with mechanical valves and bioprosthetic valves, respectively. Survival at 5 years was 61 +/- 7% (+/- the standard error) and 67 +/- 10% for recipients of mechanical valves and bioprosthetic valves, respectively. Male sex (p = 0.014) and urgency of operation (p = 0.006) were independent risk factors for hospital mortality. Atrial fibrillation increased valve-related mortality (p = 0.01). No patient required reoperation or experienced structural valve failure. While anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was increased in recipients of mechanical valves (9.2 +/- 2.1%/patient-year) compared with recipients of bioprosthetic valves (2.3 +/- 1.1%/patient-year), it did not result in a death or lead to permanent disability. There was no difference in freedom from any valve-related complication at 5 years. However, when all morbid events are considered, recipients of bioprosthetic valves experienced fewer valve-related complications than patients receiving mechanical valves (10.7 +/- 2.3%/patient-year versus 17.6 +/- 2.5%/patient-year, respectively; p less than 0.05). The reduced incidence of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage and the infrequent need for warfarin sodium anticoagulation favor selection of a bioprosthetic heart valve in patients older than 70 years.\r"

Preoperatively, 23 patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II, 14 were in Class III, and 3 were in Class IV. Operative mortality was 2.5% (1/40).

Postoperatively, 30 patients were in NYHA Functional Class I, 8 were in Class II, and 1 was in Class III. Major ventricular arrhythmias were recorded in 7 (35%) of 20 patients. Radionuclide angiography demonstrated impaired right ventricular function in 8 patients. Left ventricular impairment was present in 2. Total correction of tetralogy of Fallot can be performed safely in adults with low mortality and good functional improvement. The incidence of residual cardiac defects is low. The long-term importance of impaired ventricular function and arrhythmias remains to be ascertained.\r"

Following the procedure, there was no significant differences in peak right ventricular systolic pressure, right atrial pressure, right ventricular stroke volume, or cardiac index. Cardiac index remained at preoperative levels over a wide range of filling pressures. However, there was a significant decrease in right ventricular stroke work (6.0 +/- 1.3 gm-m/m2 to 5.1 +/- 0.5 gm-m/m2; p less than 0.05). Pacing the isolated right ventricular free wall resulted in marked hemodynamic improvement compared with an electrically silent right ventricular free wall. Cardiac index increased from 1.7 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 to 2.6 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.0005), and right ventricular stroke work went from 3.0 +/- 0.6 gm-m/m2 to 6.4 +/- 0.9 gm-m/m2 (p less than 0.0005). Right ventricular performance was also significantly related to the timing of right ventricular free wall contraction. Thus, the right ventricular free wall played an important role in the maintenance of normal cardiac hemodynamics.\r"

Valve function was evaluated before and after the stent posts were bent inward 15 degrees by suture constriction of the tops of the three posts. To evaluate the effects of the stent-post deformity on valve performance, the mean transvalvular pressure drop during steady flow, the bioprosthetic valve orifice area, and the maximum valve opening and closing speeds during pulsatile flow were measured using an area meter. Steady-flow data showed identical transvalvular pressure drops, and no significant difference in valve performance was detected in the pulsatile-flow study under the two experimental conditions (i.e., normal valve and deformed valve). We conclude that a 15-degree inward bending of the stent posts does not appreciably affect valve function in vitro.\r"

Since myocardial calcium uptake is increased in thyrotoxic rats, the efficacy of the calcium channel-blocking drug diltiazem in decreasing heart rate and the incidence of arrhythmias was evaluated in 11 hyperthyroid patients. All patients were studied with a 24-hour Holter monitor prior to the beginning of sole diltiazem therapy (120 mg given every eight hours), on the tenth day of therapy, and five days after therapy was discontinued. Heart rate significantly decreased by 17% during diltiazem treatment (96.5 +/- 3.7 systoles/min vs 79.9 +/- 3.2 systoles/min [mean +/- SE]) and returned to baseline values five days after the therapy was discontinued (100.7 +/- 3.4 systoles/min). Similarly, the number of premature ventricular extrasystoles per hour was significantly decreased (18 +/- 7 vs 2 +/- 1). In three patients, asymptomatic bouts of supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia disappeared during diltiazem therapy. These findings suggest that calcium-blocking drugs may be extremely useful as adjunctive therapy for thyrotoxicosis in the presence of angina, congestive failure, and tachyarrhythmias.\r"

Electrophysiologic studies are especially helpful in the management of patients with inducible tachyarrhythmias, but is of limited usefulness in those with normal EPS findings. We investigated whether clinical and noninvasive laboratory variables can predict the results of EPS in 89 patients with unexplained syncope. The prevalence of inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) was 15%; supraventricular tachycardia, 15%; bradyarrhythmias, 41%; and normal EPS, 29%. We used multivariate discriminant function analysis to predict the results of EPS. The variables selected for identification of patients with inducible VT by this analysis include New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, gender, digitalis use, nonsustained VT, and atrial fibrillation. Based on our statistical model, performing EPS on 45% of the patients with unexplained syncope would result in a 90% sensitivity in detecting patients with inducible VT. The variables selected for identification of patients with normal EPS findings include: New York Heart Association functional class, heart disease, digitalis use, and intraventricular conduction. Based on this model, it would require that all but 12% of patients with unexplained syncope be studied to achieve a 90% predictive accuracy for identification of patients with normal EPS. During follow-up, recurrence rates for the different EPS categories did not differ significantly. The five-year cumulative survival among the EPS groups were as follows: VT, 37% +/- 28%; SVT, 90% +/- 9%; bradyarrhythmias, 71% +/- 10%; and normal EPS, 96% +/- 4%. Survival of the VT group differed significantly from that of the normal group. In patients with unexplained syncope, EPS findings can be predicted from clinical and noninvasive laboratory data. Mortality during follow-up relates to EPS findings.\r"

Major depression was found in 11.5% and other depressive syndromes in 23%. While depressive symptoms and syndromes are common among the medically ill, this study demonstrated the need for careful diagnostic assessment of older patients with depressive symptoms before initiating treatment that may itself convey significant risk. Sociodemographic and health characteristics of older men at higher risk for depression were also identified. Patients more likely to be depressed were over age 75 years, had less formal education, experienced cognitive dysfunction, suffered from more severe medical illness (particularly recent myocardial infarction), and had a history of psychiatric illness. Depressive symptoms were also common among patients with renal or neurologic diseases, those having a family history of psychiatric illness, the unmarried, and the more severely disabled. Given the impact of depression on recovery from medical illness, compliance with medical therapy, and costs of extended hospital stays, detection and treatment of this disorder are imperative.\r"

Serum samples from 25 healthy EBV-seropositive individuals neutralized 3.5 +/- 5.1 U (mean +/- SD) of DNase activity and 14.7 +/- 8.5 U of DNA polymerase activity. From these values were selected upper limits of anti-EBV enzyme activity of 17.9 and 31.3 U neutralized in normal individuals, respectively (representing the 95% confidence limit). Serum samples from six groups of subjects representing a variety of EBV-related illnesses were then studied. Only patients with notably elevated anti-EBV antibody titers to viral capsid antigen (VCA) (greater than 10,000) had elevated levels of anti-EBV DNase (38 to 56 U neutralized) and anti-EBV DNA polymerase (72 to 106 U neutralized). Three additional patients and two geriatric controls with average anti-EBV early antigen/VCA titers had slightly elevated levels of antibody to EBV DNA polymerase. IgA anti-VCA, anti-early antigen antibodies, or both, were also detected in the same patients who had high EBV DNase and polymerase antibody levels. These antibody profiles are similar to those in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Since three of the six patients with elevated anti-EBV enzyme antibody levels developed fatal lymphomas, patients with chronic EBV and this antibody profile might be in another illness category at risk for malignant disease.\r"

Streamlining recommendations were made in 340 of 625 patients who were reviewed during the initial seven months. Cases that necessitated streamlining recommendations decreased from 98.6% during the first month to 54.4% during the seventh month, reflecting the educational impact of the program on prescribing habits. Recommendations were followed in 82.6% of the cases, of which 97.2% completed therapy with the streamlined regimen. The projected annual savings of the program was +107,637.\r"

No differences in relapse were observed among dose, EE, or dose and EE. Patients in the minimal dose/high-EE condition experienced more minor but aborted episodes in year 2. Side effects were fewer on the minimal dose after one year, and low-EE patients were better adjusted than high-EE patients.

Multivariate analyses suggested that a poor course after hospitalization was best predicted by a poor course before admission and by living in a one-parent household. High household EE status was a predictor only in one multivariate analysis after course of illness and one-parent household status had been entered, suggesting an interaction effect. We query the causal proposition linking high EE and relapse and suggest instead that a poor illness course may elicit high EE in relatives, particularly in one-parent households, and, thus, may make the principal contribution to the proposed link.\r"

In this report, the performance of schizophrenic patients was compared with nonschizophrenic control subjects in their ability to direct visual attention. In the first experiment, patients were distinguished from controls by a slower response to a target in the right visual field than to a target in the left visual field when attention was not first directed to the target location. In the second experiment, patients were distinguished from controls by a stronger bias in favor of symbolic information over language information about spatial direction. In both experiments, the patients demonstrated deficits in attention similar to patients from previous studies who had unilateral lesions of the left hemisphere. The identification of performance abnormalities using tasks that are simple, have dissectable cognitive components, have been related to discrete neural systems, and control for nonspecific variables provide the basis for constructing reasonable hypotheses about the cognitive psychology and functional neuroanatomy of schizophrenia.\r"

Methylphenidate induced a pattern of information processing dysfunction similar to that seen in schizophrenic patients, strengthening the linkage of the schizophrenia-information processing dysfunction-aminergic overactivity relationship. Further, the time course of the observed deficits in both schizophrenic and methylphenidate-induced states is strikingly compatible with the temporal mapping pattern of monoaminergic neuronal systems. More research is needed to identify definitively the aminergic influences on attentional functioning. A psychophysical task-pharmacologic probe strategy should prove useful.\r"

Experimentally drug-withdrawn patients, some of whom were clinically relapsed, were compared with control patients who continued taking medication in prewithdrawal and postwithdrawal SPEM tests. All groups showed a slight worsening in eye-tracking performance on two postwithdrawal tests, but significant group-by-test session \"interactions\" were not demonstrable. We also determined that patients with TD tend to substitute large, nontracking saccades for SPEM to a significantly greater extent than nondyskinetic patients. Our findings strengthen the supposition that impaired SPEM is a trait in many schizophrenics but suggest that patients with TD be excluded in future studies of SPEM addressed to trait issues.\r"

These findings suggested that alterations in the plasma MHPG level may reflect psychosis-related changes in norepinephrine function in schizophrenia.\r"

  ".W": "Among 140 depressed and control subjects, there were significant positive correlations between indexes of noradrenergic activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and urine. Among the depressed patients, CSF levels of the norepinephrine (NE) metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and urinary outputs of NE and its metabolites normetanephrine, MHPG, and vanillylmandelic acid correlated significantly with plasma cortisol levels in relation to dexamethasone administration. Also, CSF levels of MHPG were significantly higher among patients who were cortisol nonsuppressors than among either patients who were cortisol suppressors or controls. Urinary outputs of NE and normetanephrine were significantly higher among patients who were cortisol nonsuppressors than among controls. Patients who were cortisol suppressors had indexes of NE metabolism similar to those of controls. These results in the depressed patients extend recent observations suggesting that dysregulation of the noradrenergic system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occur together in a subgroup of depressed patients.\r"

An age- and demographically matched comparison group of 22 healthy, heterosexual controls was also studied. The homosexual men had lifetime rates of alcohol or nonopiate drug abuse (22/56 [39.3%]), generalized anxiety disorder (22/56 [39.3%]), and major depression (17/56 [30.3%]) that often preceded diagnosed medical illness or knowledge of HIV status. The six-month point prevalence of these disorders in homosexual men was also high, especially alcohol abuse in patients with AIDS-related complex, and the occurrence of a DSM-III disorder within the previous six months significantly exceeded that in heterosexual controls. The data suggest that there may be a higher prevalence of anxiety disorder and major depressive illness in homosexual men when compared with sociodemographically matched heterosexual men and that the psychiatric morbidity may have preceded the onset of the AIDS epidemic. These findings indicate that awareness of psychiatric history is necessary to comprehensive medical care of men at high risk for AIDS, even among relatively healthy outpatients.\r"

This strategy is an elaboration of a study design that was particularly helpful in developing criteria for several of the problematic diagnostic categories of DSM-II-R. The strategy, called a \"multiplex study design,\" employs (1) multiple collaborating centers, (2) multiple experts in the diagnoses being studied at each site, and (3) multiple diagnostic criteria sets so that alternative definitions of disorders can be compared in terms of (4) multiple external validity criteria, such as familial aggregation, course, and differential response to treatment. This strategy is a particularly efficient method for providing an empiric base for further revisions in our official classification of mental disorders.\r"

The sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of three LDH isoenzyme factors (LDH-1, greater than 90 U/L; LDH-1 greater than LDH-2; LDH-1/LDH ratio, greater than 0.4) for diagnosing AMI were assessed in three groups of patients according to total serum LDH values--group A, LDH level over 600 U/L; group B, 400 to 599 U/L; group C, 225 to 399 U/L--and in five groups of patients according to the time after admission--(1) first 48 hours; (2) three to five days; (3) six to eight days; (4) nine to 11 days; (5) 12 to 15 days. All three factors were found to be highly efficient for diagnosing AMI (91.5% to 97.5%) in groups A and B, but the most efficient factor in each group was LDH-1 value above 90 U/L. In group C, the only efficient factor was the LDH-1 value over 90 U/L (96%). The most efficient factor for diagnosing AMI in relation to time after admission up to 15 days after AMI was the LDH-1 value over 90 U/L (96% to 97.5%). The factors LDH-1 greater than LDH-2 and LDH-1/LDH above 0.4 were more efficient in patients up to five days after AMI (91.5% to 97.5%) than in patients six to 15 days after admission. We conclude that the most efficient LDH value for diagnosing AMI is the absolute value of LDH-1 above 90 U/L. Its superiority over other LDH isoenzyme values is best documented in a group of patients six to 15 days after admission and with only slight to moderate elevation of total serum LDH values (225 to 399 U/L).\r"

Suramin sodium, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor that was under investigation as a potential treatment for human immunodeficiency virus infection, has six reactive carbonyl groups. Because of suramin's chemical structure, it was hypothesized that the drug might cause a positive DAT in vitro and possibly in vivo. Suramin was found to produce a positive DAT in vitro at concentrations of 2100 mg/L or greater but did not cause a positive DAT in five patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who were treated with suramin, probably because the serum levels of suramin were too low in these patients (peak therapeutic blood levels ranged from 171 to 443 mg/L).\r"

Anatomic locations such as the head and neck area (four cases), limbs (five cases), and trunk (five cases) were involved with equal frequency. Follow-up information (median period, 4.6 years) was available for 12 patients, of whom four are alive and disease free, six have had local tumor recurrence, and two have died of their disease. Histologically, these lesions consisted of a malignant fibroblastic skin tumor intimately associated with a superficial melanoma (ten cases) or melanocytic dysplasia (four cases) that often extended deeply to the subcutaneous fat. Helpful diagnostic features included the presence of neurotropism, a lymphocytic infiltrate, and unusual patterns of triangular and periadnexal lamellar fibroplasia. Of the immunohistochemical markers employed, antisera to S100 protein and vimentin yielded the most consistent positive results. Immunostaining with NK1/C-3 (antimelanoma monoclonal antibody) was not helpful. Ultrastructural evidence of fibroblastic and schwannian differentiation was seen. We conclude that the altered morphologic melanomas is associated with a relatively favorable prognosis and believe that careful attention to light microscopic detail with immunohistochemical and electron microscopic assistance will elucidate the diagnosis in most cases.\r"

The lesions had different times of evolution. Recent lesions showed a high density of fibroblastlike cells embedded in an amorphous matrix of glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, and small amounts of chondroitin sulfates A and C and of dermatan sulfate. The progressive enlargement of the lesions was due to an increase in the amount of intercellular matrix produced by the cells that progressively displayed a pattern of peripheral stratification. In the older lesions, the matrix was mainly composed by chondroitin sulfates A and C. We suggest that juvenile hyaline fibromatosis represents a disease of the connective tissue with progressive abnormal differentiation to chondroid tissue.\r"

The large vegetation on the left coronary cusp had extended into the left main-stem coronary artery and obstructed it. There was evidence of prior embolization to the right coronary artery with mycotic aneurysm formation and myocardial infarction. Other lesions included a cerebral artery mycotic aneurysm and metastatic abscesses within the myocardium and spleen. Although the aortic valve was free of underlying chronic pathology, the causative organism was Streptococcus viridans.

There are some key aspects that we would do differently if we were now starting over, and we have provided that information to those seeking to begin similar off-site ventures who have sought our advice. There is an interesting constellation of factors that must be present for such an operation to succeed, and the individual components of that constellation will differ by institution and location. The rationale and circumstance will vary profoundly, and what is \"right\" in one setting may be entirely \"wrong\" in another. I feel compelled to caution the reader about the myriad of determinants and ingredients that must be considered. Study the precedents and seek knowledgeable advice from financial, legal, insurance, human resource (personnel), and laboratory management professionals. Regional laboratories can succeed. Hospitals may well benefit from a strategy of marketing services to physician staff members and the incremental financial and service benefits from added testing volume can be significant. However, the more expansive the business design, the more complicated the management requirements and demands and, potentially, the higher the risks, costs, pressures, and down-side factors. We feel very strongly about our focus of supporting the pathology and medical technology professions. Our value-added services are geared not only to providing technology, management, and financial services support for our clients, but also to not competing with them for local clientele. We have a program of teaching them how to market to that clientele and of providing the support materials to assist them in so doing. We have progressed from being a hospital laboratory to being a hospital laboratory referral laboratory, and now have also become a referral laboratory for other reference laboratories. As a full-service reference laboratory we send out very few tests, and are continually incorporating new tests and technologies. We have referral testing accounts currently in 42 states and we want to be the very best at what we do, namely, esoteric reference testing. Our credo is that quality at ARUP is making best continually better.\r"

The local recurrence rate for standard radical mastectomy is 12.4% (8/70) and for ultraradical mastectomy it is 0% (0/78). Proportionate survival at 20 years for standard radical mastectomy was 59.8% (95% confidence limits, 0.598 +/- 0.14) and for ultraradical mastectomy it was 98.1% (95% confidence limits, 0.981 +/- 0.04).\r"

The morbidity and mortality associated with hepatic resection have been most closely correlated with intraoperative blood loss. The results of 37 hepatic resections for secondary neoplasms were retrospectively reviewed. This group included 18 patients who underwent anatomic resections and 19 patients who underwent nonanatomic resections. The nonanatomic group experienced significantly less blood loss, shorter operating times, shorter hospital stays, and no significant difference in long-term survival. A positive relationship between blood loss and postoperative complications is demonstrated for the combined groups. These results support the use of nonanatomic resection whenever feasible for secondary hepatic tumors. We describe the technique for nonanatomic hepatic resection for metastatic lesions, with special emphasis on hemostatic techniques.\r"

Washed red cell suspensions were found to include toxic degradation products that had been released from a deposit of platelets and white cells adherent to the centrifuge bowl wall. When reinfused, these toxic products resulted in a \"salvaged blood syndrome\" of intravascular clotting and pulmonary damage. The pulmonary arterioles showed leukocyte margination and tangled fibrin skeins with occlusive thrombi. Intra-alveolar and perivascular hemorrhages, along with extensive pulmonary edema, were also observed. The formation of procoagulant and leukoattractant material could be markedly decreased when the red cell salvage technique incorporated the following precautions: (1) minimal dilution with saline (normal plasma protein levels), (2) a low calcium level, and (3) minimal platelet activation (avoidance of the aspiration of clotted blood just before processing).\r"

Clinical and gross pathologic findings were not found to be useful in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Giant fibroadenomas occurred primarily in black adolescents and were histologically distinct. Positive surgical margins were found to be the best predictor of local recurrence of benign or malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes. Systemic metastases occurred in only one case of malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes. Most benign and malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes may be treated by wide local excision with tumor-free margins.

Outcome was analyzed using a Carotid Neurologic Score (CNS). The CNS is a quantitative measure of neurologic outcome and survival and ranges from -1 to +3. The higher the CNS, the more favorable the outcome. The conditions of nine patients in group 1 neurologically improved after treatment, 41 were the same, and four were worse. Forty-four patients were neurologically intact and three died. The mean (+/- SD) CNS was 1.9 +/- 0.8. In group 2, one patient's condition improved, 13 stayed the same, and four deteriorated. Ten patients were intact and two died. The mean CNS was 1.3 +/- 1.13. In group 3, two patients' conditions improved and six stayed the same. All eight patients were intact; there were no deaths. The mean CNS was 2.3 +/- 0.35. There was a significantly higher CNS for groups 1 and 3 compared with group 2. The CNSs of groups 1 and 3 were not significantly different. Arterial reconstruction provides the best outcome for all penetrating CA injuries except nonocclusive limited intimal injuries that require only observation.\r"

Because failure of initial drainage and predrainage organ failure were associated with increased mortality, improvement in both of these criteria contributed substantially to the lower mortality in group 2 patients. There were no differences in mortality, in initial success in drainage, or in length of hospital stay when 29 group 2 patients who underwent percutaneous drainage were compared with 37 patients who underwent surgical drainage. Mortality (22% vs 21%) and initial success (78% vs 72%) were similar for patients who underwent surgical and percutaneous drainage, respectively.

We examined the hypothesis that the initial fluid requirements might also predict development of subsequent pulmonary failure and death. Fluid balances were calculated for the first 24 hours in the intensive care unit for 100 high-risk trauma patients. The mean (+/- 1 SD) fluid balance for 63 patients who developed pulmonary failure was 4.6 +/- 5.5 L; the mean balances for the 37 patients who did not develop pulmonary failure were 1.0 +/- 3.1 L. The balances in 23 patients who died and in 77 who survived were 6.8 +/- 5.4 and 2.2 +/- 4.5 L, respectively. A cutoff value of 3 L determined prospectively before beginning the study predicted pulmonary failure with a sensitivity of 52% and a specificity of 89%. For mortality, the 3-L cutoff point gave a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 74%. The predictive value of the fluid balance was independent of other prognostic indicators, such as revised trauma scores, injury Severity Scores, and modified APACHE II scores. This simple measurement should help in allocating intensive care unit resources, as patients in positive fluid balance are likely to require Swan-Ganz catheterization and are likely to require long-term mechanical ventilation. The fluid balance should also be useful in stratifying patients for entry into clinical trials.\r"

This fear of postsplenectomy sepsis has led to an enthusiasm for splenic salvage to the extent that it may be felt that the injured spleen must be saved at all costs. However, if that is valid, the complications that result from splenic salvage must not exceed the risk incurred by loss of this organ. To assess this, 119 splenic injuries treated by splenorrhaphy were reviewed. These were major splenic injuries that were actively hemorrhaging at laparotomy and, therefore, required specific operative intervention for hemostasis. There were 14 complications in 11 patients (11.8%) directly attributed to the splenorrhaphy. In one patient, the repaired spleen rebled 17 days postoperatively, necessitating splenectomy. Ten patients had persistent or recurrent bleeding, requiring blood transfusions. Three of these underwent reexploration for additional hemostasis. Blood transfusion in association with splenorrhaphy has not previously been considered a complication. However, the literature clearly documents that the risk of blood transfusion heavily outweighs the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis. Therefore, if blood transfusion becomes a necessary adjunct for successful splenorrhaphy, then splenectomy without transfusion is the safer treatment.\r"

The death rate for patients with chronic renal failure undergoing biweekly or triweekly hemodialysis was once generally 10% per year. This pertained to a small, highly selected group of good-risk younger patients. Advancement in dialysis technology and experience has failed to reduce this rate. Essentially, all patients (including ill, elderly, and high-risk patients) are now candidates for long-term hemodialysis. In many cases, prolonged patient survival has added new importance to the extension of arteriovenous graft life. Over the last five years, approximately 1300 arteriovenous graft salvage procedures and new constructions have been performed. Of these, 70% were thrombectomies and revisions for graft salvage. Simple thrombectomy and removal of accumulated neointimal hyperplastic material along the course of the PTFE graft, and especially at the graft-venous anastomotic junction, can often extend graft life another six months to one year or more and permit immediate usage postoperatively. Graft life is even more prolonged with patch angioplasty at venous outflow stenoses or by adding a new segment of PTFE to bypass areas of venous stenosis. Conservation of unused extremities for future arteriovenous graft construction is our goal.\r"

One hundred thirty-four patients were reviewed, and the findings of IVP and NT correlated with the magnitude of hematuria on urinalysis, associated injuries, management, and outcome. Sixty-two (46%) of 134 patients had fewer than ten red blood cells per high-power field (RBCs/HPF) on urinalysis (group 1), 19 (14%) of 134 patients had 10 to 30 RBCs/HPF (group 2), and 53 (40%) of 134 patients had greater than 30 RBCs/HPF (group 3). Twenty-seven patients had renal injuries detected by IVP and NT, two in group 2 and 25 in group 3. We conclude that IVP and NT should be reserved for patients with greater than 30 RBCs/HPF on admission urinalysis.\r"

With correction of the hydrocephalus, the autonomic disturbances and fever immediately cleared. Observations from human and experimental studies suggest some potential mechanisms for the development of the syndrome. One of the subjects of this report was being treated with neuroleptics at the time of hospitalization; in him, and potentially in other similar patients, the syndrome could easily be confused with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The need for prompt appreciation of the correct diagnosis was emphasized by the rapid clearing of all neurological signs after correction of the shunt malfunction in both of these patients.\r"

Symptoms and signs of neuropathy were usually mild, and painful dysesthesias were uncommon. Amplitude reduction of sural nerve action potentials distinguished all patients with from those without clinical neuropathy. Results of other electrophysiologic studies of sural, peroneal, and median nerves were typically normal. These results provide evidence of distal axonal degeneration. Neuropathy occurred only in patients with systemic illness longer than five months' duration. When compared with patients without neuropathy, these patients had more severe weight loss and a higher incidence of clinical dementia. Follow-up evaluation showed no evidence of clinical progression over a six-month period. The pathogenesis of this common distal axonal polyneuropathy is unknown and warrants further investigation.\r"

Our aim was to determine whether the severity of dementia could be correlated with abnormalities of eye movement and whether eye movement abnormalities could be detected prior to the onset of clinical dementia. Abnormalities of eye movement were present in seven of seven patients with mild, moderate, or severe ADC and in six of seven AIDS or asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients without clinical dementia, but at risk for ADC. The eye movement abnormalities detected included disturbances of both saccadic and smooth-pursuit function, and their severity correlated strongly with the severity of dementia. The abnormalities were qualitatively similar to those that occur in Alzheimer's disease but quantitatively less severe. Recording of eye movements may be a valuable, noninvasive technique for the early detection of neurologic dysfunction in asymptomatic patients who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus or in patients with AIDS, even prior to other clinical evidence of ADC. In particular, it may be of use in selecting high-risk patients requiring antiviral therapy and in monitoring the neurologic response to such treatment.\r"

Sixty percent of the asymptomatic group had at least one abnormal result, over 25% had three or four CSF abnormalities, and over 7% had five or six abnormal values. When patients with evidence of blood-brain barrier leak were excluded, significant differences were seen between disease groups with regard to CSF glucose, CSF IgG levels, and CSF IgG synthesis. No human immunodeficiency virus-related central nervous system abnormalities were found on neurologic examination in immunologically intact asymptomatic patients regardless of CSF findings.

This effect, which has now been studied in a short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment, subsequently disappeared if patients were pretreated with a beta-blocker or with a serotonin antagonist. Cerebrospinal fluid monoamine metabolites were determined in some of these patients, and the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level was found to be significantly lower than in parkinsonian patients without pain and in normal volunteers. Given the mechanism of action of methylphenidate on the central nervous system, the adrenergic and serotoninergic mediation of its analgesic effect, and the demonstration of impaired central serotonin metabolism in the patient group, it is concluded that not only central dopaminergic deficiency but also altered noradrenergic and serotoninergic transmission in the spinal cord are quite likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of pain in Parkinson's disease.\r"

Developmental Gerstmann's syndrome may occur in brain-damaged and apparently normal children. Five children in whom DGS occurred in association with brain abnormalities underwent long-term observation, which indicated persistence of the deficits. The identification of these cases suggests that DGS may not be as rare as previously thought and may often be unrecognized. Testing for the Gerstmann elements in learning-disabled children may identify otherwise undiagnosed cases of DGS and should be routinely employed in the neurologic examination. Until appropriate teaching methods for DGS are found, \"bypassing\" the deficits and utilizing the child's strengths, plus counseling, seem to offer an effective treatment approach.\r"

This study was performed by digitizing photographs of coronal slices of the brains to compute the cross-sectional area of the cerebrum, cerebral cortex, subcortical nuclei, cerebral white matter, and the ventricular system at five standardized levels. Although the alcoholics and controls had similar demographic features and mean brain weights, brains from the alcoholic group showed mild but consistent atrophy of the cerebral cortex (2.5% to 4.2% reductions in cross-sectional area at all five levels), moderate atrophy of cerebral white matter (6.1% to 17.5% reductions), and enlargement of the ventricular system (31.8% to 71.9% increases). There were no differences in the sizes of subcortical nuclei. The absolute increase in the size of the ventricles in the alcoholic group was roughly equal to the amount of tissue lost in cerebral white matter, thereby representing hydrocephalus ex vacuo. The disproportionate loss of cerebral white matter relative to cerebral cortex suggests that a major neurotoxic effect of chronic alcohol intoxication in the central nervous system is axonal degeneration.\r"

We have found a significant reduction of 5HT in the anterior hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and posterior lateral hypothalamus and a decline in spiperone binding in the anterior hypothalamus of patients with AD. The ChAT activity was found to be diminished only in the posterior lateral hypothalamus of patients with AD. No NE or dopamine alterations were found in any region of the AD hypothalamus. In the normal hypothalamus, dopamine, NE, and 5HT were found to be regionally distributed. Our study documents region-specific neurotransmitter abnormalities in the AD hypothalamus and raises the question of the relationship of these changes, especially in 5HT, to some of the noncognitive clinical alterations observed in AD.\r"

The therapeutic effect occurred in more than half of the patients with inherited outer retinal disease or uveitis, but in none with primary retinal vascular disorders.

Tranexamic acid reduced the incidence of secondary hemorrhage significantly: none of 26 eyes of patients who received systemically administered tranexamic acid and were confined to bed rest rebled, and only one (1.1%) of 95 eyes of children who received tranexamic acid and were allowed free ambulation in the hospital rebled.\r"

Reproducibility was good in both the manometric study (SD = 1.09) and in the clinical study (SD = 1.21).

In the manometric study, the Tono-Pen had less mean error at high pressure ranges than either the MacKay-Marg tonometer or the pneumotonometer. In the clinical study, no statistically significant difference was found between the Tono-Pen and the applanation tonometer at pressures of 10 to 35 mm Hg (the extent of the data spread). In addition to being reliable and accurate, this miniaturized tonometer is portable and easy to use.\r"

Terbutaline had no effect on daytime aqueous flow rates, but stimulated flow by 15% during sleep. The drug had no significant effect on intraocular pressure. This study confirms past observations that beta-agonists exert their maximal effects during sleep, when endogenous adrenergic stimulation is at a minimum.\r"

Aqueous bioassays revealed significantly elevated prostaglandin E2 level (23.33 +/- 4.32 ng/mL) and histamine activity (13.0 +/- 2.76 ng/mL) in all samples from patients with epidemic dropsy glaucoma as compared with negligible levels in control samples from patients with open angle glaucoma. Aqueous biochemical analysis revealed increased total protein level (1.03 +/- 0.10 g/L) with a normal globulin pattern as compared with controls (0.26 +/- 0.08 g/L). On histopathologic and histochemical testing, a normal trabecular meshwork was found in 11 of the 12 trabeculectomy specimens. It is concluded that dropsy glaucoma is hypersecretory in nature; prostaglandin and histamine release may have significant roles in its pathogenesis.\r"

Threshold measurements were performed at 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, and 25 degrees nasally along the 180 degrees meridian with the F4 program on an OCTOPUS perimeter, and with twice-repeated profiles on a Humphrey perimeter. The reduction in differential light sensitivity correlated well with the 2.7-dB to 16.7-dB reduction in stimulus intensity caused by the 46% to 98% scattering of incident light by the diffusers. Contrast sensitivity in the presence of a glare source (Miller-Nadler glare test) was also affected by the diffusers, such that a 75% contrast target was not visible through the strongest diffuser whereas a 5% contrast target was visible without a diffuser. Conversely, the diffusers had very little effect on visual acuity measurements that were performed with projected high-contrast targets in a darkened room. Our data suggest that even minimal light scattering, such as might be caused by a cataract that has a relatively insignificant effect on visual acuity, may influence threshold measurements.\r"

Sixty-two (82%) of the patients had successful, sustained (greater than 12 months) posterior retinal reattachments at last examination. Of these 62 patients, 40 (65%) had complete retinal attachment, with no evidence of regrowth of periretinal membranes or redetachments following the initial procedure. In the remaining 22 cases with successful reattachment of the retina posterior to the equator, partial peripheral retinal detachments were observed. In 16 of the 22 cases, the detachments occurred entirely anterior to the boundary of the previously placed photocoagulation lesions. The posterior retina remained uninvolved, and no further treatment was needed. Reoperation was required in the other six patients to achieve sustained posterior retinal reattachment. Postoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/40 to bare light perception, with 69% of the anatomically successful cases obtaining functional visual acuity (greater than 20/400). Failures were related to reproliferation of fibrous membranes.\r"

Lipofuscin accumulation was particularly notable in some pigment epithelial cells in the fovea. An accumulation of heterogeneous material located between Bruch's membrane and the pigment epithelium in the fovea was believed to represent the location of a previtelliform lesion. This material appeared to be derived from degenerating pigment epithelial cells and contained few intact lipofuscin granules. Foveal photoreceptor loss occurred above the lesion and in midperipheral sites where the subretinal space contained collections of outer segment debris and phagocytic cells. Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy appears to be a generalized disorder of the pigment epithelium that secondarily affects focal areas of the retina.\r"

Maximal trophozoite populations were established four to five days after initial subculturing; mature cysts were routinely noted three to six days later. At various time points, trophozoites and/or cysts were harvested and suspended in Page's saline. Following a previously described protocol, samples of the suspensions were placed on glass slides and incubated with one of a panel of 14 FCLs. At the end of the incubation period, the slides were examined using an epifluorescence microscope. Concanavalin A brightly stained both cysts and trophozoites. Wheat germ agglutinin brightly stained cysts but only minimally stained trophozoites. These results suggest that FCLs may be useful for rapid visualization of Acanthamoeba organisms in corneal infections.\r"

In a masked fashion, eyes were treated with either fibronectin or balanced salt solution. Areas of the photographically documented fluorescein-stained defects were measured by computerized planimetry. The mean healing rate in fibronectin-treated eyes with standard wounds was linear but not significantly different from the rate in control eyes. The healing rate in persistent epithelial wounds treated with fibronectin was slower than that in standard wounds and was not linear, but it was not statistically significantly different from that of control eyes with persistent epithelial wounds. These results conflict with those of previous studies and indicate that the topical application of fibronectin in rabbits does not necessarily promote corneal epithelial wound healing.\r"

We have established a rabbit model in which epiretinal membranes form on the inferior peripheral retina after the injection of activated macrophages into the vitreous. By two months, the membranes were extensive but without evidence of traction. At four months, however, full-thickness retinal folds were present beneath the thick epiretinal membrane. A homogeneous glial cell composition was suggested by light microscopic examination of serial sections through several membranes. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein and antivimentin and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that these thick epiretinal membranes were composed entirely of glial cells, which may cause mild traction on the retina; this traction is associated with cell alignment and the tissue bridges connecting the membrane and the retina. The fusiform densities and indented nuclei suggested that the glial cells within the membrane may possess some characteristics of myofibroblasts.\r"

The RPE cells remained as a monolayer for at least four weeks in organ culture, and individual RPE cells became taller and dome shaped. The RPE cells retained several prominent ultrastructural features, including apical microvilli, intracellular melanosomes and mitochondria, and intercellular tight junctions. Since the cellular substratum can exert important influences on cell behavior, the ability to maintain RPE cells attached to Bruch's membrane provides a new in vitro tool for studying the metabolic activity of this tissue and its response to external stimuli, including laser photocoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbits were given an intravitreous injection of 5.0 x 10(5) rabbit retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, human RPE cells, or human dermal fibroblasts in one eye and an injection of vehicle alone in the other eye. Some rabbits were treated with retinal cryopexy or intravenous sodium iodate on the day before injection. Vitreous fluorophotometry (VFP) and fundus examinations were performed before and at various times after cell injections. Retinal detachments were graded by premortem ophthalmoscopic examinations and postmortem gross pathologic examinations. Eyes injected with cells had higher VFP readings than eyes injected with vehicle at all time points. Eyes injected with fibroblasts or rabbit RPE had significantly higher mean VFP values before the onset of retinal detachment than those injected with human RPE cells. Within each group, high levels of fluorescein leakage in the first week correlated well with severity of subsequent traction retinal detachment and the fibroblast and rabbit RPE groups had more severe detachments than the human RPE group. Treatment with cryopexy or sodium iodate resulted in higher VFP readings, a higher frequency of retinal detachments, and detachments that occurred earlier and that were more severe. These data demonstrate that intravitreous cells cause blood-retinal barrier breakdown in rabbits and that the amount and duration of this breakdown are important variables in retinal detachment formation.\r"

The trabeculens can also be used for laser trabeculoplasty, with the addition of an indentor, and for laser iridectomy, with the addition of a 20-diopter planoconvex button lens.\r"
