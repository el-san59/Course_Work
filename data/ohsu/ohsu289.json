Eczema and wheezing occurred to a similar extent in the two groups during the first year of life, although napkin rash, diarrhoea, and oral thrush were commoner in the intervention group, especially during the first three months. Breast feeding for any length of time was associated with a reduced incidence of wheezing and diarrhoea.\r"

The survival of those babies who had to remain at the hospital of birth (49%) was significantly lower than for those transferred to the regional centre (71%). Those babies declined admission had significantly lower gestational ages and birth weights than those accepted. For those babies with respiratory failure and birth weights of less than 1500 g within these two groups, however, there were no significant differences in birth weight, gestational age, or gender yet survival was significantly better for those transferred. Babies from multiple pregnancies caused particular problems if neonatal transfer was required.\r"

The presentation was usually polysymptomatic with gait disturbance being the main complaint in 36 children. Sensory abnormality, predominantly pain, was present in 40 children; this indicates a strong association between psychogenic pain and conversion disorder in children. At discharge 32 were completely recovered or had appreciably improved. There was a core group that presented particular difficulties with diagnosis and showed little positive response to treatment.\r"

The normal range for HbA1c was 4.7-8.8% and for fructosamine was 0.98-1.88 mmol/l. These were similar to adult normal ranges and there were no significant age differences during childhood. There was a highly significant correlation between HbA1c and fructosamine in the diabetic children but this was lost when only concentrations within the established normal ranges were considered. Adjustment of concentrations of fructosamine for total serum proteins made no difference to the results. Changes in HbA1c and fructosamine were followed in three newly diagnosed patients and in one whose diabetes was getting worse. HbA1c decayed with a half life of 28.7 days and fructosamine decayed with a half life of 16.5 days. Fructosamine concentrations were lower than expected in the patients who were improving and higher than expected in the patient who was deteriorating. It is suggested that while fructosamine is not a direct substitute for HbA1c it may be a useful adjunct in determining whether a patient is worsening or improving in the short term. A change from HbA1c to fructosamine for routine assessment of diabetes while retaining HbA1c on selected occasions would result in some cost savings while retaining the advantages of having both assays available.\r"

  ".W": "In normal coronary arteries, reactive hyperemic responses to a 20-second occlusion, an index of coronary reserve, usually demonstrate a peak-to-resting flow velocity ratio of 4:1 or more. Most intraoperative studies that have assessed reactive hyperemic responses in bypassed vessels have reported peak-to-resting flow velocity ratios of 2:1 or less following a 20-second occlusion. These decreased reactive hyperemic responses could be due to coronary vasodilatation after cardiopulmonary bypass or to an inadequate physiological result of the surgical procedure. In 14 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries, the peak-to-resting flow velocity ratio following a 20-second coronary occlusion decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) from 4.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- standard error) before bypass to 3.0 +/- 0.3 after bypass. In a similar dog model, the peak-to-resting flow velocity ratio decreased by 36 to 52% during the first hour following one hour of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegia. During the same period, left ventricular perfusion increased 21 to 30%, mean arterial pressure and coronary vascular resistance decreased, and myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged. In a second group of dogs studied for the effects of duration (200 to 240 minutes) of anesthesia and thoracotomy alone, peak-to-resting flow velocity ratio was significantly lower. These clinical and experimental studies suggest that major coronary vasodilatation occurs early following cardiopulmonary bypass and cold cardioplegia, and may contribute to the blunted coronary reactive hyperemic responses reported during this time. Consequently, an intraoperative peak-to-resting flow velocity ratio of 3:1 for bypassed coronary arteries may represent an excellent physiological result.\r"

  ".W": "It has been observed in a proportion of patients, that clinically cardiac asystole persists for a prolonged period during intraoperative reperfusion. To evaluate this phenomenon, isovolumic functional indices (left ventricular [LV] balloon) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MV02) were compared in 22 canine preparations before and after two different interventions. After 45 minutes of normothermic global ischemia, (1) the control group (N = 11) was maintained on cardiopulmonary bypass with the hearts beating empty and (2) the experimental group (N = 11) was subjected to cardioplegia reperfusion at normothermia for one hour. In contradistinction to the initial hypothesis, functional recovery was better in the experimental group compared with the controls. Significant differences were observed in recovery of LV peak developed pressure (LVPDP) (controls, 66.8 +/- 7.3% [mean +/- standard error of the mean], and experimental group, 99.5 +/- 8.9%; p less than 0.05), maximum rate of rise of LV pressure (controls, 116.6 +/- 16.2%, and experimental group, 147.7 +/- 10.1; p less than 0.05), and maximum fall of LV pressure (controls, 100.3 +/- 15.8%, and experimental group, 143.1 +/- 11.5%; p less than 0.05). Correlation between LVPDP and MVO2 was also better preserved in the experimental group (controls: r = 0.15, N = 74, p = 0.18; experimental group: r = 0.47, N = 75, p less than 0.001). Values for myocardial water content and total creatine kinase in the two groups were similar. It was concluded that prolonged asystole during intraoperative reperfusion is not detrimental; on the contrary, there is enhanced functional recovery of the myocardium similar to that seen after secondary cardioplegia.\r"

  ".W": "To address the controversy regarding the choice of operation for achalasia, the cases of 57 patients having operation, 38 for the first time (Group 1) and 19 with a previous procedure (Group 2), were reviewed. Surgical emphasis was on hiatal dissection to maximize exposure and use of the Belsey fundoplication to achieve cardiac competence without obstruction. Operative mortality was 1 (1.8%) of 57 patients. In group 1, 21 of the 38 had prior pneumatic dilations. All were treated with esophagomyotomy and a Belsey fundoplication. Clinical results are excellent or good in 30 (88%) of the 34 patients for whom follow-up is available, and are similar in patients with and without prior dilation. Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure decreased from 22.3 to 7.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and pH testing shows no reflux in any of 13 patients. In Group 2, previous operations were esophagomyotomy in 13, esophagomyotomy plus a Nissen fundoplication in 3, and a Nissen fundoplication only in 3. The initial operation failed because of inadequate myotomy in 6 patients, an obstructive Nissen fundoplication in 6, and reflux esophagitis in 7. In these 7 patients, acid reflux testing documented reflux due to cardiac incompetence and delayed clearance. Reoperations included takedown of a Nissen fundoplication in 6, esophagomyotomy and Belsey procedure in 15, Belsey procedure in 1, and resection plus colon interposition in 2. Clinical results are excellent or good in 12 (75%) of the patients with follow-up. These conclusions can be drawn. (1) Esophagomyotomy and Belsey fundoplication lowers LES pressure and provides good results with low risk, even after pneumatic dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Kent bundle interruption for ventricular preexcitation has been successfully accomplished utilizing several different surgical techniques. The external closed-heart technique of Guiraudon combining surgical dissection and cryoablation has been used to interrupt 52 accessory pathways in 47 consecutive patients since May, 1985. The 35 male and 12 female patients ranged in age from 10 to 67 years (mean, 30 years). There were 25 left free wall, 13 right free wall, 13 posterior septal, and 1 anterior septal accessory pathways. Preoperative and intraoperative electrophysiological studies were performed in all patients to induce the arrhythmia and localize all accessory pathways. The operation consisted of dissection of the atrioventricular fat pad. Following this, the delta wave and retrograde accessory pathway conduction disappeared, thereby indicating successful pathway ablation. In 4 patients with right-sided accessory pathways, interruption of the pathway required cryoablation. Cryolesions (made with cryoprobe at -60 degrees C for two minutes) were created in the region of the accessory pathway insertion. All accessory pathways were successfully ablated without any deaths or heart block. Concomitant surgical procedures were performed in 4 patients. Two patients required a second operation the next day for an accessory pathway not found at the initial operation. Three patients had postpericardiotomy syndrome, and 4 had recurrent atrial fibrillation requiring therapy. The remaining patients have had no arrhythmia recurrence and have remained drug free after a follow-up of 1 month to 22 months (mean, 12.5 months). We conclude that the closed-heart technique of accessory pathway ablation is safe and reproducible, obviates the necessity for aortic cross-clamping and cardioplegic arrest, and allows instantaneous monitoring of conduction over the pathway.\r"

Contiguous 5-mm thick MR images of the thorax from the level of the cardiac apex to the aortic arch were obtained in 4 normal volunteers and 3 patients with congenital heart disease: 1 with pseudotruncus arteriosus and 1 with a ventricular septal defect, each with Eisenmenger's complex, and 1 with aortic coarctation. Each image could be obtained at up to seven different intervals throughout the cardiac cycle with ECG gating. The scanning procedure is noninvasive and requires no contrast material. Using standard software, images from each interval in the cardiac cycle were edited to isolate pertinent cardiac and great vessel structures. High-resolution 3-D reconstructions were formed for each interval by stacking the edited images. Sequential projection of 3-D reconstructions from each interval yields four-dimensional (includes time) cine views. Both 3-D and cine views can be obtained from any axis or divided in any plane to allow accurate, noninvasive assessment of cardiac and great vessel anatomy, chamber volumes, and regional and global wall motion. Noninvasive 3-D reconstruction of the heart and great vessels provides accurate anatomical data not available from standard cardiac catheterization or other noninvasive diagnostic procedures, and aids in the preoperative planning of the procedure to correct complex congenital malformations.\r"

  ".W": "Balloon dilation by the percutaneous route has recently been recommended as an alternative to surgical intervention in the management of calcified aortic valvular stenosis. To investigate the validity of balloon valvuloplasty, this procedure was carried out in the operating room under direct vision in 30 patients just prior to excision and replacement of the ossified aortic valve. Changes induced by balloon dilation were evaluated by visual inspection as well as by geometric measurements. By visual observation, balloon valvuloplasty did not have a detectable impact on the valvular anatomy in about 19 of the patients and induced enlargement of the functional aortic orifice judged as \"minimal\" or \"moderate\" in only 11. In no patient was there a substantial increase in the functional orifice size. These findings were supported by geometrical measurements. Therefore, we believe that the virtues of this procedure have been grossly overstated by its proponents and that it should be offered only to patients who present a truly forbidding risk by standards of modern surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) reduces the systolic stress integral (SSI) in the normal left ventricle. We tested the hypothesis that the SSI does not decrease in poorly contracting, dilated, ejecting hearts during ECMO. In 14 sheep, four pairs of ultrasonic crystals measured changes in left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and three LV diameters. Volume calculations were validated by balloon distention of the ventricles after death (slope = 0.85; r = 0.85). SSI was measured during ECMO flows of 20 to 100 ml/kg/min in both normal and dilated, poorly contracting hearts produced by 30 minutes of warm ischemia. After warm ischemia, end-systolic elastance, an index of contractility, decreased from 8.3 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/ml to 2.9 +/- 0.4 mm Hg/ml (p = 0.001) and peak systolic pressure decreased from 47.4 +/- 0.7 mm Hg to 37.5 +/- 0.08 mm Hg (p = 0.01). In normal hearts, as ECMO flow increased, SSI decreased from 10.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg.sec to 7.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg.sec at 60 ml/kg/min (p = 0.001). However, in postischemic hearts, SSI progressively increased from 6.6 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.sec before ECMO to 12.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg.sec at ECMO = 100 ml/kg/min. These studies indicate that the initial effect of ECMO on the poorly contracting, dilated heart increases LV wall stress and that the increase in stress is proportional to ECMO flow. The increase in stress is primarily due to an increase in afterload, which more than offsets decreases in systolic and diastolic volumes.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital aortic stenosis presenting within the first 6 months of life is a highly lethal anomaly. Although aortic valvotomy has offered excellent palliation in many instances, the operative risk remains substantial. To better understand the factors associated with a poor operative result, the records of all patients less than 6 months of age undergoing aortic valvotomy at our institution from 1972 through 1986 were analyzed. Nineteen patients (58%) (Group I) survived operation; 14 (42%) (Group II) died. The following variables were analyzed in an attempt to define those with prognostic significance: mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), left ventricular (LV) peak systolic pressure, LV end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic aortic valve gradient, LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV ejection fraction, and age at operation. The only variables that were significantly different in the two groups were mean PA (Group I, 29 +/- 3 mm Hg, and Group II, 54 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and LVEDV (Group I, 50 +/- 8 ml/m2, and Group II, 20 +/- 4 ml/m2; p less than 0.05). No patient with an LVEDV of 20 ml/m2 or less survived operation. We conclude that small LV dimension and elevation of PAP may be predictive of a poor surgical result in patients with severe aortic stenosis presenting in infancy.\r"

Postoperative morbidity and mortality with this provisional operation led Cotton, in 1980, to substitute anterior cricoid split as the primary definitive procedure. Within the past three years, anterior cricoid split has been performed in 4 infants, aged 3 to 9 months, with acquired (3 patients) or congenital (1 patient) subglottic stenosis requiring ventilation through an endotracheal tube. Following cricoid split, the trachea is stented for 12 to 14 days by a nasotracheal tube, with extubation and rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room with the patient under anesthesia to confirm healing and patency. During an 18- to 24-month follow-up in these 4 patients, morbidity has been minimal, patency has persisted, and stridor has not recurred. Accordingly, a conclusive operation, cricoid split, rather than a temporizing tracheostomy may be employed for certain obstructive tracheal lesions early in life.\r"

The mean aortic cross-clamp and bypass times were generally longer in Group 1 compared with Group 2. Group 1 patients with simple transposition undergoing primary repair (N = 15) had an aortic cross-clamp time of 80 +/- 8 minutes and a bypass time of 203 +/- 27 minutes versus 64 +/- 6 minutes (p less than 0.001) and 170 +/- 15 minutes (p less than 0.01), respectively, for similar patients in Group 2 (N = 10). Group 1 patients with simple transposition undergoing staged repair (N = 7) had an aortic cross-clamp time of 71 +/- 6 minutes and a bypass time of 201 +/- 24 minutes versus 66 +/- 4 minutes (p = not significant [NS]) and 226 +/- 25 minutes (p = NS), respectively, for Group 2 (N = 6).

It consists of two parts: (1) a sewing ring incorporating a circlip and (2) a functioning valve (either mechanical or tissue). The circlip is encased in a sewing ring, which is sutured into the natural valve annulus, and grips the functional part of the prosthesis, thereby preventing dislodgment. A simple instrument has been designed to open the circlip a few millimeters to allow easy removal or insertion of the functional element. This sewing ring/circlip with the functional element of a Bjork-Shiley prosthesis was used in 10 baboons undergoing mitral valve replacement. Removal and replacement of the functional element was carried out at a second operation between 1 and 12 weeks later. There were no operative deaths. Baboons were electively killed one day to twelve months after the second operation. There were no complications related to the prosthesis; cardiac catheterization showed normal hemodynamics before and after the second operative procedure.\r"

The residents showed a significant increase in knowledge and perceived themselves as having significantly more influence on their patients who smoke after completion of the training program. Counseling skills improved significantly in the use of questions and exploring feelings as judged by blind evaluation of videotapes. The results of this three-hour training program suggest that physicians in training are responsive to the teaching of specialized skills deemed important for promoting health behavior changes in their patients.\r"

In the treatment of 86 patients with type II hyperlipidemia (cholesterol level, greater than 6.85 mmol/L [greater than 265 mg/dL]; triglyceride levels, normal or mildly elevated), compliance with the protocol resulted in reductions in cholesterol level of 19% in patients treated with diet, 23% for those treated with diet plus a bile sequestrant (colestipol hydrochloride or cholestyramine resin), and 25% in those treated with diet plus other cholesterol-lowering drugs. This method of treatment was effective and may serve as a model for the management of large numbers of patients with this condition.\r"

Survival analysis showed that the serum cholesterol level in 1960 was independently related to the 25-year incidence of myocardial infarction. This long-term relation was mainly due to the strong association between serum cholesterol level and 15-year incidence of myocardial infarction. Similar but less pronounced relations were found between serum cholesterol level and 15- and 25-year mortality from myocardial infarction. Serum cholesterol level was related neither to long-term incidence of and mortality from cancer nor to mortality from all causes.\r"

The number and types of organisms recovered from patients who received penicillin prophylaxis alone or with streptomycin were similar. Anaerobes were recovered twice as frequently as aerobes. Polymicrobial bacteremia was rare and only one patient had streptococci detected in the blood culture. Addition of penicillinase to one blood culture medium, however, and comparing it with a similar medium without penicillinase was accompanied with a sixfold greater recovery from patients of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including six patients with streptococcal bacteremia.

Taking advantage of the fact that amylase is filtered in the glomerulus and reabsorbed by the proximal tubules, we prospectively examined in 23 patients if changes in renal amylase creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) can predict gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Eighteen of these patients had an initial creatinine clearance (rCcr) above 30 mL/min. Eleven of them (group A) had an ACCR above 3.5% (control 3% +/- 1.03%) and all exhibited an average reduction of 32.2% +/- 11.6% in rCcr following one week of gentamicin therapy. In contrast, only one of seven patients (group B) with an initial ACCR below 3.5% had a reduction, albeit transient, in rCcr. During gentamicin therapy, group A patients had a further increase in ACCR which was proportional to the reduction observed in rCcr (r = -.54). Our preliminary data suggest that ACCR may prove a simple and possibly a reliable predictor of kidney function deterioration during gentamicin therapy in patients with rCcr above 30 mL/min: patients with pretherapy ACCR above 3.5% may exhibit a deterioration in the creatinine clearance during the first week of therapy. For patients with pretherapy renal failure (rCcr less than 30 mL/min) the creatinine levels (but not the ACCR) seem to retain their significance in predicting and monitoring further renal function deterioration during aminoglycoside therapy.\r"

An incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer was used. Before basic training, peak exercise measurements did not reveal significant differences between groups other than a slightly lower, albeit significant, value for oxygen uptake (VO2) per kilogram (42 +/- 1 vs 45 +/- 1.4 mL/min per kilogram) for the SCT group. Both groups experienced modest overall cardiovascular improvement reflected in both peak and submaximal exercise responses. No statistically significant difference was observed between the SCT and the control groups at the end of basic training for any of the measured variables at peak exercise, including power (258 +/- 6 vs 266 +/- 9W), VO2 (3.24 +/- .06 vs 3.36 +/- .16 L/min), VO2 per kilogram (46 +/- 0.7 vs 46 +/- 1.2), minute ventilation (138 +/- 4 vs 147 +/- 8 L/min), heart rate (185 +/- 2 vs 184 +/- 3 beats per minute), oxygen pulse (17.6 +/- .3 vs 18.4 +/- 1 mL/min per beat), as well as anaerobic threshold (1.81 +/- .04 vs 1.80 +/- .06 L/min), respectively. No medical problems directly attributed to SCT were reported; it remains uncertain, however, whether a seizure experienced by one of the other SCT basic trainees after a two-mile run was SCT related. The results of this study would, therefore, suggest that for the majority of individuals who possess SCT, the response to the moderate training regimen provided by army basic training is not impaired.\r"

The prevalence of gastritis on histologic examination was found to be 20%. There was no relationship between the presence of macroscopic findings at endoscopy and the presence of histologic gastritis. In all instances where histologic gastritis was documented, Campylobacter pylori was observed in the gastric mucus. Mucosal tissue invasion by C pylori was not observed. The presence of gastritis and C pylori was associated with fasting hypochlorhydria. Follow-up evaluation was performed eight to 13 months after the initial endoscopic evaluation in three of the volunteers with positive test results. Persistence of C pylori and gastritis was observed. These findings suggest that histologic gastritis is common in healthy, asymptomatic individuals and is strongly associated with the presence of C pylori.\r"

The SICU patients were more likely to have received prior antibiotic therapy and had significantly higher numbers of endotracheal tubes, arterial lines, central venous lines, and indwelling bladder catheters. Of the 23 variables univariately associated with nosocomial infection, only five remained significant after entry into step-wise regression models. The MICU patients had a higher fatality rate in the MICU than did the SICU patients (18% vs 10%), but the relative risk of a death following nosocomial infection was 3.5 for both groups.

These findings demonstrate that the regression to the mean effect is confined to those individuals who do not report a history of hyperlipidemia. Subjects with this history are more likely to have their initial cholesterol elevation confirmed when the test is repeated.\r"

Within the preceding year, 55% of women aged 40 years or older had breast examinations performed by physicians, and 20% of women aged 50 years or older had mammograms. Women who were uninsured or lower in socioeconomic status were less likely to have each of these three preventive measures, independent of the age, health status, and frequency of physician visits of the respondent. In addition, women aged 50 years or older were less likely to have had Papanicolaou smears (63% vs 89%) and breast examinations (52% vs 68%) than those women aged 20 to 49 years. These findings suggest that women who are older, uninsured, or lower in socioeconomic status are at an increased risk for not receiving preventive care, and that screening mammography, although more common than a decade ago, is still markedly underused.\r"

Critics have argued that paternalism has no place in physician/patient encounters. Patients must always be treated as autonomous agents, capable of directing the course of their medical care. Informed consent has come to represent the mechanism through which autonomy can best be assured in medical relationships. If provider/patient interactions are viewed as a contract between consenting agents, then providers are obligated to obtain informed consent for all interventions they wish to undertake. This view, however, relies upon examples of care provided to those with acute medical problems. In rehabilitation, it can be argued that for some patients at some times during their care, a contractual model would be inappropriate. Especially when patients have undergone a sudden and unexpected course of severe impairment, it is difficult to conceptualize provider/patient relationships in the context of a contract. Providers are more accurately seen as acting in educational roles toward those in their care. If this is so, then there may be instances in which paternalistic behavior toward rehabilitation patients is ethically justified. Informed consent must be carefully examined if it is to be a useful doctrine in the context of rehabilitative care.\r"

A widespread assumption is that family care is superior care and, with modest degrees of support, families can provide that care. Yet we may question the ethical limits of the obligation of a family or family member to provide care when the demands are severe. Psychologic and moral problems that confront caregivers are examined. In some cases caregivers must sacrifice their present and future welfare. That the moral claim made upon them may seem a justifiable one in many respects does not mean that it will be endurable; that it is endurable does not mean that it is justifiable. The problem is exacerbated by lack of a supportive culture, one that rewards and honors those who take on heroic duties. Caregivers may be socially isolated. If heroic demands are to be made on family members, a richer moral culture is required, not just the provision of improved social services.\r"

Resources should not be expended upon patients who will not benefit from treatment. The current process of patient selection requires providers to consider both medical and nonmedical factors. Medical factors include diagnosis, prognosis, secondary complications, functional performance and prognosis, and ability to learn. Nonmedical assessment includes social, vocational, financial, and personal factors. There is a potential for subjectivity in the way these variables are considered. Practitioners may be unaware of bias in their decision-making. Patients may be disadvantaged by lack of family or financial resources. Both providers and patients suffer when providers are forced by expectations of utilitarianism to deny treatment to deserving patients. It would be helpful if patients and families were informed about the process of selection of rehabilitation candidates and given the right of redress if rejected. Guidelines delineating standards for admission to rehabilitation centers could assist patient selection. Finally, rehabilitationists must seek to further demonstrate the efficacy of their treatment in order to better identify persons who will benefit from rehabilitation services.\r"

The studies were done before, and 13 weeks, 16 weeks, and one year after grafting. The preoperative electrodiagnostic evaluation showed abnormalities involving the median motor fibers and the palmar cutaneous branch. Electromyography of the opponens pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis before surgery showed severe active denervation. Thirteen weeks after nerve grafting, the median motor distal latency was prolonged and the amplitude of the evoked potential of the median motor and index finger digital sensory nerves were decreased. At 16 weeks, both the latency and amplitude showed improvement, as did EMG of the affected muscles. One year later, the electrophysiologic findings were normal except for a slightly prolonged median motor distal latency. Clinical and functional improvement after grafting correlated well with the electrophysiologic findings. We conclude that EMG and nerve conduction studies are useful tools for following the progression of recovery after nerve grafting.\r"

Yet, discrepancies persist in the literature as to whether or not antagonist electromyographic activity is increased in hemiparesis. We have developed a technique to obtain simultaneous counts of motor unit activity in a wrist flexor and extensor muscle using monopolar needle electromyography. Stable stroke patients and age/sex matched control subjects were tested during maximal voluntary isometric wrist flexion and extension. Fewer agonist events (p less than 0.05) and more antagonist events (p less than 0.10) were counted in paretic than in control muscles. A co-contraction ratio of antagonist activity to total (agonist and antagonist) activity was much greater for patients than controls (p less than 0.01). We conclude that both agonist recruitment and antagonist inhibition are impaired in the hemiparetic arm.\r"

The present investigation was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular responses to vertical head-down suspension with such a device. Eight men were monitored for three minutes in the upright and supine position, and for ten minutes in the vertical head-down position. Stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (QT), segmental arm blood flow (ABF), and segmental leg blood flow (LBF) were measured by impedance plethysmography. Moving from the upright to the supine positions resulted in an SV increase from 93.1 +/- 18.8 to 138.2 +/- 28.2 ml.beat-1 (p less than 0.01). During the first minute of suspension a further increase in SV to a maximum of 178.6 +/- 45.0 ml.beat-1 was noted. By the end of the suspension period, SV had declined to 159.6 +/- 34.2 ml.beat-1. Resumption of the upright position was associated with a reduction in SV to 94.3 +/- 15.8 ml.beat-1. Changes in QT across the supine and vertical head-down positions reflected the changes in SV. The vertical head-down position was also associated with a gradual reduction in both ABF and LBF. These data suggest that the primary effect of inverted suspension was a transient increase in venous return, which requires an effective ventricular response. An element of caution should be exercised in using these devices to avoid aggravating concurrent pathologic conditions.\r"

Although improved shielding and circuitry have made newer pacemakers less vulnerable to extraneous electronic artifact, their increasing use may expose more patients to the complications of electromagnetic interference. The effects of nerve conduction stimulation testing (NCST) on patients with cardiac pacemakers were evaluated both clinically and in the laboratory. Estimates of interference potentials likely to occur at a pacemaker input during NCST were made by making calculations from a theoretical model. For three different pacemakers, these estimates were compared to laboratory tests of sensitivity to interference. Some potential for pacemaker interference was shown to exist, although primarily with unipolar pacing leads. Twenty patients, five of whom were monitored electrocardiographically, underwent uneventful nerve conduction studies. Although pulse producing stimulators have the potential to affect demand type pacemakers, if current paths are confined within standard clinical parameters, untoward responses appear unlikely.\r"

Considerable divergence of views was found in all six areas rated, with nurses rating patients at admission as significantly less independent than did the therapists. This difference remained in the ratings at discharge in four of the six areas. Additionally, those patients able to be interviewed (n = 53) were surveyed as to the degree to which they saw progress (or deterioration) during their stay. Correlations between these patient ratings and change ratings by the staff were not statistically significant. The findings suggest the need for additional communication among the various disciplines, as well as between staff members and patients, to work toward a consensus view of the rehabilitation process.\r"

Maximum muscle strength was also obtained using a standard test (ST) protocol. The ST protocol consisted of three five-second trials with a one-minute rest between trials and no more than four muscle groups tested per day. The QT protocol allowed only a five-second rest between trials. Thirteen subjects were evaluated using both protocols. Subjects were positioned either sitting or supine, depending on the muscle groups being evaluated. Stabilization was provided to minimize substitution patterns. Measurements were obtained using a load cell and a computerized recording system. Using the QT protocol and testing 13 muscle groups in one session vs five sessions with the ST protocol resulted in an average reduction of 4% in strength values for the QT protocol. The results suggest that the clinical use of the QT protocol may not significantly reduce the accuracy of repeated measurements even though values obtained may be slightly lower than those obtained using the ST protocol.\r"

We treated three brothers in one family on our rehabilitation unit, resulting in definite improvement in their ability to walk and control the dystonic movements, and in their speech and swallowing. All three benefited from orthoses to prevent equinovarus and maintain ankle stability. Intense concentration, such as needlepoint, seemed to reduce the amount of extra motion. Performing another activity during dystonic movements, such as pointing to a communication board, also seemed to give some relief. A special seating system using a collapsible wheelchair, a low center of gravity, and antitip wheels reduced one brother's frequency of falling. Swallowing finely cut foods was not a problem with any of our patients, although one had to be instructed in a special technique. An electronic communication board was very helpful. Our success in these cases should encourage others working in rehabilitation to consider such patients and to apply the principles of rehabilitation, particularly the total team approach, in their care.\r"

A secondary problem is the need to spare the cartilaginous framework that gives shape to the ear. With fixed-tissue micrographic surgery, all incisions are made through fixed (killed) tissue as successive layers of tissue are conservatively removed for microscopic scanning of their undersurfaces by the systematic use of frozen sections. Because no incisions are made through live tissue, no melanoma cells are spilled during the excision of the neoplasm and its \"silent\" outgrowths. Satellites too small to be seen are not moved or disturbed and can be removed as they appear. The reliability of the method is indicated by a five-year cure rate of 75% in a series of 17 patients.\r"

If the tumor mass could be peeled from the periorbita, the eye was saved. Preservation of eyes in the patients without periosteal invasion did not alter survival. Frozen-section control may be used to determine periorbital involvement. If the periorbita was minimally involved, it was locally resected. If invasion of the periorbita was extensive, an orbital exenteration was done. Only five of 41 patients required exenteration. Local recurrence of disease in the orbit has not occurred in these patients.\r"

By embracing the concept that prevention is better than cure, it is generally possible to avoid the \"operated-on look\" following cosmetic surgery. We describe a number of safeguards we use to preserve natural-looking eyes following lower lid blepharoplasty in men and women. The most common, permanent complication described following conventional lower lid blepharoplasty is the round eye. The condition is readily identified by an increase in scleral show between the limbus and lower lash margin. Closer evaluation will reveal inferomedial displacement of the lateral commissure, increased slope of the lateral third of each eyelid, a flattened, unanimated, pretarsal component, and an unnatural infralash crease produced by the healed incisional scar. These findings are one step short of ectropion; therefore, the methods herein described should help reduce the incidence of this more dreaded and serious complication of blepharoplasty.\r"

The number of microspheres in the investigated tissue was assessed by direct counting under a microscope. The number of microspheres in the reference blood was counted by a Coulter counter. These experiments have shown that CoBF at the end of six hours of continuous noise exposure does not significantly differ from the CoBF in control animals.\r"

Occasionally, however, the affected cervical node lies adjacent to the facial nerve and/or its marginal mandibular branch. There can be a substantial risk of damage to the facial nerve and its branches in excision of such an infected mass with surrounding edema and cellulitis. An alternative and safe method of treatment in these cases is needle aspiration of the contents of mass. Of 17 cases of atypical mycobacteria-induced cervical adenitis seen at UCLA from 1975 to 1985, nine were treated by aspiration alone. None of these required further surgery. All were treated with one or more antituberculous agents during and after aspiration. This method of needle decompression of cervical nodes provides a safe and effective way to treat atypical mycobacteria infection that overlies the facial nerve and its branches.\r"

Immunofluorescence assays for HIV demonstrated viral gene expression in only 5% of cells (100-200 cells per line) 24-48 h after microinjection; however, no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable, presumably due to a low level of virus release in this limited number of cells. Therefore, to indirectly assess infectious virus release, microinjected cells were cocultured with human T4 antigen-positive lymphocytes (H9) sensitive to HIV infection. Syncytia formation, electron microscopy, reverse transcriptase activity, and radioimmunoassay for HIV p24 were used to monitor viral gene expression in cocultures. HIV was efficiently recovered by cocultivating H9 with microinjected cells 48 h after microinjection, regardless of the tissue type or species of origin. H9 syncytia were visualized in some cocultures as early as day 5 but were readily apparent in all experiments on days 7-10. Syncytia induction in H9 was the earliest and most reliable indicator of infectious virus release. A recombinant construct containing a subgenomic envelope gene derived from the proviral clone of HIV was microinjected into human glioblastoma cells. Twenty-four to 48 h after manipulation, 5-20% of microinjected cells were found by immunofluorescence assay to express low levels of a putative gp120. These results suggest a possible approach to producing virus-free HIV envelope antigens in mammalian cells and may be relevant to subunit vaccine development.\r"

It can also inhibit the shedding of infectious HIV into the tissue culture medium from chronically infected lymphoma cells (KE37-III) as shown by infectivity assays and Western blots of the supernatant. HIV-specific proteins, however, were accumulated intracellularly. The initiation of a de novo HIV replication after infection of permissive KE37-1 cells was completely inhibited at concentrations of D609 which still permitted mitotic divisions of the cells. Furthermore, the selective antiviral activity of the xanthate compound was evidenced by the absence of HIV replicative intermediate DNA. The expression of cellular genes, such as c-myc, remained unimpaired within these cells.\r"

The two seropositive males (blood donor and drug abuser) were diagnosed clinically as having persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, an AIDS-related condition (ARC), and the child presented with developmental disorders and neurologic manifestations. This is the first report of AIDS/ARC cases from Pakistan that can be directly related to HIV infection and its heterosexual transmission.\r"

We have now studied the cytopathic effects of TPA-type tumor promoters (teleocidin, aplysiatoxin, and TPA) and the non-TPA type tumor promoters (palytoxin and thapsigargin) on MOLT-4/HIVHTLV-IIIB cells. All TPA-type and non-TPA type tumor promoters tested except palytoxin stimulated in HIV production three- to sevenfold, and caused more lysis of MOLT-4/HIVHTLV-IIIB cells than of the parental MOLT-4 cells. Fifty percent of the MOLT-4/HIVHTLV-IIIB cells were killed by teleocidin, aplysiatoxin, TPA and thapsigargin at concentrations of 2.0, 2.0, 1.0 and 10 ng/ml respectively, and by palytoxin at the very low concentration of 2.0 pg/ml. Moreover, combinations of one TPA-type tumor promoter and one non-TPA type tumor promoter--but not the combination of two TPA-type tumor promoters--had additive lethal effects, supporting the idea that TPA-type and non-TPA type tumor promoters exert their cytolytic effects by different mechanisms. These latter effects may be due to production of prostaglandin E2, which is commonly induced by both types of tumor promoters.\r"

It was shown that 32% of the perfusion area of the occluded coronary artery was irreversibly damaged. There was, however, no significant correlation between the decrease in left ventricular function (ejection fraction assessed by angiography) and the extent of myocardial necrosis. Upon reperfusion, salvage of 68% of the perfusion area of the occluded vessel was obtained. Viability of the myocardium in this area was demonstrated by electron microscopy. However, postischaemic regional function was completely lost in the first 24 h, in spite of this considerable amount of viable tissue. Nevertheless, regional function recovered after 1 week of reperfusion, which suggests a stunned myocardium in the early postischaemic phase. These results show that histological examination of postischaemic tissue has prognostic value in terms of recovery of function, but a direct correlation between structure and function does not exist in the early reperfusion phase.\r"

All available patients (62 cases) with definite seronegative disease were matched, where possible, for sex, age and year of onset with seropositive controls (54 cases). Seronegative females were just as likely as those who were seropositive to require treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, whereas seronegative males were significantly less likely to do so than seropositive controls. There were no major differences in outcome or drug toxicity. Orthopaedic surgery was equally common in the two groups, with a similar spectrum of procedures, but there was a trend towards more frequent upper limb large joint arthroplasty in the seronegative group, and this was particularly evident when elbow prostheses were considered. Seronegative rheumatoid disease (at least in females) may be as severe as seropositive disease in a referral-centre population and should be treated with similar vigour.\r"

The drug was given in two forms; as simple ketoprofen (Orudis) and as a slow release preparation (Oruvail), when the drug was not released into the stomach, but into the small intestine. These formulations were compared with indomethacin for endoscopically proven damage to the UGIT. Orudis and Oruvail produced similar damage to previously normal UGITs over 56 days; each formulation produced about a 50% incidence of ulceration and inflammation. Indomethacin, by comparison produced less damage. The results suggested that the direct action of ketoprofen (barrier breaking effect) adds little to the mechanism of gastric cytotoxicity of this drug, which may be assumed to be predominantly caused by a systemic effect of ketoprofen on gastric cytoprotective mechanisms.\r"

Sections were examined for the presence and severity of gastritis and of C. pylori. Forty-four of 52 patients (85%) had histological evidence of gastritis. Twenty-six of 44 (59%) patients with gastritis were positive for C. pylori. Twenty-six of 28 patients with 'active' (polymorph infiltration) chronic gastritis were positive for C. pylori (p less than 0.002). Sixteen of 26 bacteria-positive patients had gastrointestinal symptoms compared with eight of 26 bacteria-negative patients (p less than 0.05) and this may have therapeutic implications.

Grip strength, Ritchie's index, joint circumference, joint pain, and patient's and physician's global assessments were estimated, and conventional laboratory parameters were followed. In addition, the time-concentration profiles of indomethacin and paracetamol were assessed during steady state. All patients had measurable plasma drug levels, indicating adequate compliance, and responders and nonresponders (five on each treatment) had equal drug levels, indicating that the variation in therapeutic efficacy was not secondary to pharmacokinetic differences. While there were fewer and milder side-effects during treatment with the drug combination, there was no difference in therapeutic efficacy. Hence, it appears that the main therapeutic profit of indomethacin in daily doses greater than 50 mg is enhanced analgesia. As such dosage involves pronounced side-effects, it seems more appropriate to employ the combination of 50 mg indomethacin and 4 g paracetamol, whereby similar analgesia can be obtained without an increase in side-effects.\r"

Evaluation included a specific questionnaire for subjective xerophthalmia and xerostomia, slit-lamp eye examination after rose Bengal staining. Schirmer's I test, stimulated parotid flow measurement, testing of sera for autoantibodies and labial minor salivary gland biopsy. A greater than or equal to 2+ lip biopsy score on Tarpley's scale was a sine qua non for the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. Labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy revealed fibrosis and/or fatty infiltration in the majority of the individuals, related to ageing. However, four people had a lip biopsy score of greater than or equal to 2+, which, supplemented by other objective criteria, classified three of them as having pSS. Another four had an LSG biopsy score of 1+, and although they fulfilled other objective criteria, they could not be characterized as pSS. All these individuals were completely asymptomatic, and none of them had anti-Ro(SSA) or anti-La(SSB) autoantibodies. The present study suggests that pSS in elderly people in elderly people is subclinical, benign and relatively common.\r"

There was a uniformity of views amongst the four specialties in terms of the likelihood that a given clinical presentation was due to active CNS lupus. The clinical presentation made little difference to the interpretation of laboratory data. CNS abnormalities (EEG, CT, and CSF), as well as the finding of serum DNA antibody of 95%, influenced decision-making, although the other serological tests had little impact. There was disagreement amongst physicians as to whether a given test abnormality (e.g. focal CT scan abnormality) supported or rejected the diagnosis of active CNS lupus. This study indicates that physicians interpret test results selectively in their assessment of patients with SLE who develop CNS symptoms.\r"

The strongest association with the severity of peripheral radiological damage was rheumatoid factor (p less than 0.0001 for both the latex titre and RAHA titre). Subluxation of the cervical spine was associated only with the presence of HLA-Dw2 (p less than 0.02) and HLA-B7 cross-reacting group (p less than 0.02). Discriminant function analysis utilizing latex titre, RAHA titre, haemoglobin level, and platelet count predicted the development of erosive or nonerosive disease in 79%. This method was less successful in predicting the actual severity of erosive damage and was not improved by the addition of HLA data. Radiological outcome in the cervical spine was successfully predicted in 82% using HLA-Dw2, HLA-B27 and age of onset of disease. It is concluded that the best predictors of erosive disease were standard laboratory features measured at onset, but that more powerful discriminant factors are needed if these are to influence clinical practice. Further prospective studies will establish whether rheumatoid involvement of the cervical spine is an expression of the influence of HLA determinants in this disease.\r"

  ".U": "88209875\r", 
  ".W": "An epidemiological survey of multiple sclerosis (MS) in three Australian cities, Perth, Newcastle and Hobart, was undertaken with its prevalence day being the national census day on June 30, 1981, exactly twenty years after a previous survey of the same cities. The relationship between increasing prevalence and increasing south latitude found in the 1961 survey was confirmed in this present study. Prevalence rates had increased significantly over the twenty years between the studies. Over the same time period incidence rates had also increased in Newcastle and Hobart but had remained essentially stable in Perth although these changes were not significant. The rise in prevalence was due to a combination of factors of differing importance in each city. These factors included better case ascertainment, increased recognition of the less severely disabled patient, increased survival time and differential immigration of a population at a higher risk of developing MS than the indigenous population. Finally, analysis of MS prevalence rates amongst migrant populations in Perth and Hobart suggested that either the risk of acquisition of MS may extend over a wider age range than is generally accepted or that environmental factors prevalent in the former city have modified disease expression there.\r"

  ".W": "Eye-head coordination was measured in patients with Parkinson's disease as they made horizontal gaze shifts in response to predictable and unpredictable target steps and to targets moving smoothly with either constant or sinusoidally varying velocity. Patients preferred not to move their heads for both large and small amplitude gaze shifts. Both eye and head movement reaction times were prolonged. Saccades were hypometric and, frequently, slow. Head movements were also slow, hypometric, and varied in amplitude for target shifts of a given amplitude. Compensatory eye movements (CEMs) that normally stabilize gaze direction during head movement varied in gain from zero to greater than unity, and often drove the eyes off target. CEM abnormalities occurred most commonly in patients with abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain in darkness. We attribute these abnormalities of programming combined eye-head saccades to dysfunction of striatonigralcollicular circuits. Smooth gaze pursuit gain, the ratio of gaze velocity to target velocity, was lowered in patients while tracking sinusoidal targets at 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 Hz. Some patients could track these targets with the head fixed but not with the head free. We attribute this to abnormal suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex. The results indicate that Parkinson's disease impairs motor programming of coordinated eye-head gaze saccades and disrupts normal interaction between head movement and the VOR.\r"

The symptoms began in the presenium and the length of illness was 4 to 5 years. The language disorder corresponded in all patients to a severe form of amnesic aphasia but a moderate to marked semantic breakdown was also found. Formal language examination was complemented by extensive neuropsychological testing. This revealed a severe deficit in language-dependent cognitive tasks. The patients were given a follow-up language and neuropsychological examination. In addition to the deterioration of language functions, a significant decline was observed in nonverbal intelligence tasks even though their level of performance still remained within the normal range. Follow-up with standardized intelligence tests might detect a trend towards generalized dementia in similar cases. This would mean that these patients should be considered as presenting with slowly progressive aphasia preceding generalized dementia.\r"

Information related to content and date of past events was assessed separately. In recall of the content of personal and public events, both groups showed a gradient of deficit in which remote events were affected less than recent ones; the magnitude and temporal extent of the retrograde loss was related to severity of dementia. By contrast, gradient effects were not evident in the recall of date and were less marked in the recognition of content or date. In public and personal events tests, patients with PD showed a relative impairment in dating capacity, compared with their memory for the content of events, which was independent of dementia. These results suggest that dementia affects the recall of distant events less than recall of recent ones. Furthermore, the selective gradient effects in recall of content suggest that memory for date is served by cognitive processes independent of memory for event content. In PD, dating capacity is a sensitive measure of remote memory function that may be disrupted independently of dementia.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the results of an investigation into the spatial and temporal properties of the saccadic eye-movement system in a subject with a 'blind' hemifield caused by accidental damage to the left geniculostriate projection. The results show that blind hemifield stimulation can elicit goal-directed saccades of short latency provided the contrast of the visual stimulus is above the threshold required for saccade generation at the corresponding stimulus eccentricity. Signal processing associated with blind hemifield pathways shows reduced sensitivity by comparison with the normal hemifield and greater dependence on stimulus size, eccentricity and mode of presentation. Higher contrast levels are always needed for blind field stimulation and larger variance in mean saccadic amplitudes and latencies is normally observed. Large stimulus eccentricities which would normally require corrective saccades exhibit a different response pattern to that observed in normal vision. The results show that the centre of gravity effect and the generation of rapid, 'express-saccades' observed in normal vision are not inevitable outcomes of midbrain processing of visual information. The subject's performance reveals strategic patterns of eye-movement responses which maximize the use of his normal hemifield. Visual performance in the control of saccadic eye-movement responses appears to be optimum when the detection of the visual stimulus is associated with both the geniculostriate and the midbrain pathways. Experiments designed to test for the effects of light scatter into the normal hemifield show that the subject's saccadic eye-movement performance following visual stimulation of the blind hemifield cannot be attributed either to the amount or the pattern of light scatter into the normal hemifield. The implications of present findings on the results of other studies of eye-movements in subjects with scotomas associated with cortical lesions are also examined.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance imaging techniques were used to study the development of astrocytic gliosis following a cortical freezing injury in 4 cats, and the findings compared with the histological and ultrastructural appearances of the affected white matter. In the first week after lesioning, the acutely oedematous white matter was apparent as a region of signal abnormality with very prolonged T1' and T2' relaxation times. Following resolution of this oedema, the images remained normal for a period of approximately three months. After this latent period they became abnormal once again, and the abnormal signal was most evident in images emphasizing differences between tissues in T1' and proton density, but not T2'. The light and electron microscopic appearances of the corresponding tissue were of astrocytic gliosis in each animal. Measurement of the relaxation times, T1' and T2', of the abnormal regions revealed an increase in T1' without a corresponding change in T2'. The T2' magnetization decay characteristics were consistently monoexponential, in contrast to the clearly biexponential T2 decay which has previously been demonstrated in the presence of acute vasogenic oedema. These findings suggest that the pattern of change of the relaxation times and T2 magnetization decay might provide a means of distinguishing between lesions in multiple sclerosis which are predominantly gliotic, and those containing significant amounts of oedema.\r"

The present study was designed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose oral MPA in women with clinical parameters suggesting potentially hormonally sensitive metastatic breast cancer. The first 28 patients received 800 mg/day, and 11 of them had received no previous hormone (NPH) therapy. The response rate (complete plus partial) was 63% for those receiving NPH and 12% for those receiving previous hormone (PH) therapy. Toxicity was significant at these doses, especially for women treated for more than 5 weeks. Toxic effects included excessive weight gain, Cushingoid facies, worsening of diabetes mellitus, and other stigmata suggestive of hypercorticism. Nineteen other patients were treated at 400 mg/day with a 60% response rate for 10 NPH patients and 44% for patients with PH treatment. Toxicity was less severe in these patients. The median time to treatment failure was 23 weeks, and to survival, 119 weeks for all treated patients. Moderately high (400 mg/d) and higher dose (800 mg/d) oral MPA are capable of inducing reasonable response rates in patients with NPH treatment. The toxicity of these regimens was significant--profound weight gain was dose limiting in some patients. While effective, high-dose oral MPA is unlikely to supplant tamoxifen as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer.\r"

To examine this question, we reviewed the clinical and pathologic features of 85 autopsied patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung. Patients who were treated with chemotherapy plus radiation survived significantly longer than all other patients (P less than 0.005), but there were no significant differences in the mean number of metastatic sites or overall tumor burden at autopsy. Patients who were treated with chemotherapy only had significantly more frequent (P less than 0.05) and more extensive (P less than 0.005) metastases to the leptomeninges, more frequent metastases to other sites within the lungs (P less than 0.05), and less frequent metastases to the adrenal glands (P less than 0.01) and pancreas (P less than 0.05). The patients who were treated with radiation only had more extensive metastases to the adrenal glands (P less than 0.005), and more frequent metastases to the pancreas (P less than 0.001), colon (P less than 0.01), and cerebral white matter (P less than 0.05). The patients who were treated with both chemotherapy and radiation had more frequent and more extensive metastases to the gastrointestinal tract (P less than 0.05) and serosal surfaces (P less than 0.01), but not to any site within the central nervous system (CNS). The latter suggests that prophylactic treatment of the CNS may not be necessary to prolong survival when patients are treated with both chemotherapy and radiation. The results also suggest that although chemotherapy and radiation may prolong survival in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, these forms of treatment change the biologic behavior of the tumors by eliminating certain clones that are distinguishable by their metastatic patterns.\r"

Treatment was repeated every 28 days for two cycles. Complete restaging then was performed, and response to treatment was determined. Of the 46 patients, five (11%) achieved a complete response, five (11%) achieved a partial response, nine (19%) obtained disease stabilization, and 27 (59%) had progressive disease. If four patients who died of rapidly progressive disease are included, the response rate drops to 20%. Overall median survival was 6 months. These results are inferior to the 40% and 46% response rates reported by other investigators. The modest response rate toxicity and expense of the regimen do not support its use in metastatic melanoma except, perhaps, in selected patients with soft tissue and/or lung metastasis.\r"

Sixty-nine patients receiving six different combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, including DDP were examined. Twenty-eight of these patients received DDP in combination with the radioprotective agent S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)-ethylphosporothioic acid (WR 2721). No risk factors were identified relating to personal habits or past medical history of the patients. However, patients receiving DDP (40 mg/m2) on 5 consecutive days had a significantly higher incidence of neuropathy. Patients receiving DDP in combination with WR 2721 had a significantly lower incidence of neuropathy, and the mean dose at onset was significantly higher than the mean dose at onset of neuropathy for all other groups. In addition, five of six patients who were available for long-term follow-up demonstrated nearly complete reversal of the signs and symptoms of neuropathy.\r"

Adding carbogen breathing (6 hours) or Fluosol-DA (Green Cross, Osaka, Japan) and air breathing to this drug treatment did not change the tumor growth delay observed. When 2 hours of carbogen breathing was delivered immediately after injection with Fluosol-DA and Adriamycin, a tumor growth delay of almost 36 days was observed, which was a significant increase from the tumor growth delay obtained with Adriamycin alone (P less than 0.01). Increasing the carbogen breathing time to 6 hours immediately after drug administration resulted in a tumor growth delay of about 43 days which was not statistically significantly different from the tumor growth delay seen with the complete treatment and 2 hours of carbogen breathing, but was different from the drug alone (P less than 0.005). A morphologic evaluation of Adriamycin cardiotoxicity in combination with Fluosol-DA and carbogen breathing was carried out. There was only mild cardiotoxicity in all treatment groups. There was a trend towards increased cardiotoxicity of Adriamycin as the treatment dose was increased from 1 to 4 mg/kg/dose, reaching statistical significance (P less than 0.05) for the Adriamycin (4 mg/kg/dose) + Fluosol-DA + carbogen breathing group when compared to the three treatment groups at 1 mg/kg/dose Adriamycin. The results of these studies indicate that there may be a therapeutic gain by the use of Fluosol-DA and carbogen breathing in combination with Adriamycin chemotherapy.\r"

No associations were identified for sex, race, parental age, parental education, complications of pregnancy, labor, or delivery, or the previously reported factors of birth weight greater than 4000 g or gestational duration of 36 weeks or less. In 6.6% of the cases and 0.8% of the controls, physical anomalies were noticed before discharge from the newborn nursery. Of the six anomalies reported in the cases, four were found to be the tumor itself or a complication of it. A significant protective effect (odds ratio (OR), 0.47) was noticed for a maternal history of previous fetal loss. Future studies, including biologic markers and stage stratification, may yield more insight into the cause of this disease.\r"

The timing of the peripheral hematologic remission of individual blood elements was similar to that reported for other interferons, and 60% of patients attained a complete peripheral hematologic remission at 9 months. Two patients relapsed despite a good initial response to IFN. No anti-IFN antibodies could be detected in their sera. In vitro studies of colony formation from the peripheral blood of all responding patients showed that rIFN-alpha-C did not inhibit the growth of colonies but favorably affected the maturation of their elements towards monocytes, granulocytes, and erythroid elements. The relapsing patient examined initially experienced a similar beneficial in vitro response which paralleled his in vivo improvement. During relapse, rIFN-alpha-C inhibited both the colony formation and the myelomonocytic differentiation in the in vitro cultures. These findings may suggest that the acquired resistance to IFN in our patient could be due either to an acquired stem cell maturation arrest in response to IFN or to emergence of a new clone indifferent to IFN-alpha-C differentiation effect.\r"

Smith (1983) with the conventional grading system according to Kernohan (1938), specimens from 72 patients were graded according to both systems, and survival times of the patients were compared. Survival rates decline in older patients. No interaction between the age of the patient and the degree of the tumor was found. No influence of localization of the tumor on survival was found. Similar to the system of Kernohan, the grading system of Smith distinguishes between only three groups of patients with significantly different survival times. In Smith's Grade A and Kernohan's Grade 1 the longest survivals are found; while in Smith's Grade D and Kernohan's Grade 4 the shortest survivals are found. Smith's Grades B and C as well as Kernohan's Grades 2 and 3 were intermediate with respect to the survival times of the patients and did not significantly differ from each other. With the independently significant features (cell density, pleomorphism, and necrosis) evaluated according to simple on-off scoring, and with the reduction from four grades to three, the grading system according to Smith would provide a simple and good, concise grading system for oligodendrogliomas of the brain.\r"

Transverse histologic sections were taken and examined for minimum tumor clearance. The clinical status of patients for at least 4 years of observation was correlated with microscopic clearance of margins. The actual presence of tumor at the margins of resection was found in 21 (30%) of the specimens. The tumor was found to reach within 1 mm, 2 mm, and more than 2 mm from the margins in nine (13%), four (6%), and 36 (51%) specimens, respectively. The anterolateral margin was most commonly involved (19%), followed by the posterolateral (11%), postcricoid (7%), and upper (1.4%) margins. Local recurrence was found to be related to degree of clearance as 10 of 21 (48%) patients with no clearance and one of nine (11%) with 1 mm clearance had local failure. None of the patients with 2 mm clearance or more developed local recurrence. It is concluded that step-serial whole organ sectioning is an adequate method for thoroughly examining resection margins in laryngectomy specimens.\r"

The number and position of labeled epithelial cells in this group was compared with an older control group of 12 and two groups of individuals at high risk for colon cancer. The latter were (1) 18 young asymptomatic individuals from familial colon cancer families without polyposis with a 50% risk for colon cancer, average age 24.1 +/- 3.7; and (2) 17 older individuals with the same genetic background and risk factor, average age 53.8 +/- 10.2 years. A group of 20 young individuals from cancer-free branches of familial colon cancer kindreds with a 25% risk for colon cancer, average age 23.1 +/- 3.6, also was studied. No overall differences in labeling index (LI) were found among the young groups, i.e., the control versus the low risk or high risk. The range of LI values was narrow regardless of risk. However age was associated with a significant increase in LI as observed among older controls and the 50% risk group as compared to younger persons; the range of LI values was wider among the older groups regardless of risk. Concerning the distribution of DNA-synthesizing cells, young controls had significantly more S-phase cells in the lower third of the crypts than either young high-risk or low-risk groups (P less than 0.05). Similarly, young controls had significantly fewer labeled cells in the middle third than the young high-risk group and young controls had significantly fewer S-phase cells in the upper third than did young low-risk or high-risk groups. When young and old members of the same group were pooled, the control group had the highest percentage of labeled cells in the lower third of the crypt (62.5%) which was significantly higher than both the low-risk (53.7%) and the pooled high-risk groups (51.6%). For the upper third of the glands, the low-risk (7.6%) and the pooled high-risk groups (6.8%) were significantly different from the controls (3.3%). Thus initial risk for colon cancer is more related to the distribution of S-phase cells than to their number, i.e., LI. Risk appears to be related to more DNA-synthesizing cells in the upper crypt, an indication that relatively early on in life the DNA switch-off mechanism shows signs of being defective.\r"

Forty-three had systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), nine had primary large cell lymphomas of the brain, 11 had Hodgkin's disease (HD), and one had plasmacytoma evolving to myeloma. Those with systemic NHL included 40 (93%) with intermediate or high-grade histologies, 35 (81%) with advanced stage (III, IV), and 28 (65%) with extranodal disease at presentation (predominantly marrow and meninges). Overall survival was short (median, 10.5 months from diagnosis) with the majority of deaths attributable to AIDS-related opportunistic infections (OI). However, 17 patients with diffuse NHL achieved a complete clinical remission, and nine now have been disease-free for more than 1 year (median follow-up, 28 months; range, 12 to 73 months). Early stage and lack of systemic symptoms were features associated with prolonged disease-free survival. Primary brain NHL was a uniformly lethal manifestation of AIDS, being diagnosed at postmortem in seven of nine severely immunosuppressed homosexual men. As with NHL, a propensity towards advanced disease and extranodal involvement was also observed in HD, suggesting that the atypical clinical behavior of HD may be an additional epiphenomenon of AIDS. This experience tends to argue for the use of intensive therapy in at least some patients with AIDS-related systemic NHL since it has resulted in a proportion of long-term disease-free survivors.\r"

Of the 1035 patients, 715 were treated with radiation therapy; 281 patients did not receive radiation therapy; and 39 patients whose records were lost. The patients were further subdivided according to the dose of radiation therapy (greater than 4000 rad versus less than 4000 rad), the presence or absence of pathologic confirmation of diagnosis, whether or not follow-up was complete, and whether or not distant metastases developed during treatment. All patients are included in the analysis. The 5-year and 10-year absolute survival rates for the entire group of 1035 patients are 19.6% and 14.5%, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year relative survival rates for the 715 patients who received radiation therapy are 28.4% and 21.0%, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year relative survival rates of the 464 with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis, who were without evidence of distant metastases and who received at least 4000 rad were 34.7% and 25.4%, respectively. Details regarding our statistical methods as well as an exact breakdown of the patient population are presented.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term survival rates were correlated with selected clinical features in 479 patients with embryonal carcinoma of the testis and 33 patients with endodermal sinus tumor (infantile embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor). In the period 1977 to 1982 embryonal carcinoma accounted for 26.8% of newly diagnosed germ cell tumors and 43% of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors entered in the Centralized Cancer Patient Data System. Among patients with embryonal carcinoma, over 80% were diagnosed in the 15-to-34 year age group. Seventy-four percent of the patients had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and 50% of these had distant metastases, attesting to the aggressiveness of embryonal carcinoma and its tendency to early hematogenous spread. Despite the highly malignant nature of the tumor, the overall 5-year survival rate with treatments used was an excellent, 88%. Survival was correlated with the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis; the 5-year actuarial survival rates for patients with localized, regional, and distant disease were 98%, 96%, and 74%, respectively. Endodermal sinus tumor was uncommon (1.8% of all testicular germ cell tumors), occurred predominantly in the younger age group (0-24 years), and in 50% of the cases was localized to the testis. The survival rate for the 33 patients with this form of tumor was slightly worse than for the \"adult form\" of embryonal carcinoma. The authors conclude that survival of patients with embryonal carcinoma has greatly improved over the last decade as a result of improved methods for early detection of metastatic deposits and the effectiveness of newer chemotherapies in the treatment of disseminated disease.\r"

Total protection from emesis was achieved in 12 (26%) of the high-dose courses and in three (7%) of the low-dose courses of metoclopramide. Major control (one or two emetic episodes) was achieved in seven (16%) and in four (9%) of the courses, respectively. The higher dose of metoclopramide significantly reduced the degree of nausea as recorded on a visual analogue scale. A significant difference between courses 1 and 2 could only be seen when the high-dose treatment was followed by low-dose metoclopramide. The duration of anorexia after the courses was not influenced by the metoclopramide dosage. Side effects were mild. It is concluded that there is a dose-response relationship for the antiemetic effect of metoclopramide.\r"

Ga imaging was negative in 95% (20/21) of the patients who were clinically considered to be in remission and in whom treatment was stopped. The disease did not recur during a follow-up of 12 to 26 months in 15 patients. Six patients developed recurrence of the disease 3 to 12 months after treatment was stopped. In all six patients Ga imaging became positive again at the time of the appearance of active disease. In the group of patients in remission, CT was negative in 57% (11/19), chest x-rays in 55% (6/11) and peripheral lymph nodes were palpated in none of the patients (13/13). In four patients that did not achieve remission after treatment, Ga scans were positive. Ga imaging appears useful in monitoring lymphoma response to treatment. This is probably because Ga imaging monitors tumor cell viability, whereas body CT and chest radiographs show the tumor mass, which may consist of fibrotic or necrotic tissue.\r"

Eight had exposed cryptantigens; of the eight, five were classified with additional lectins as T-polyagglutination type and three as Th-polyagglutination. A control group of 300 healthy blood donors had no exposed cryptantigens on their RBC. These findings could not be correlated with the staging of the tumor, extension of metastases, or positive estrogen or progesterone receptors of malignant tumor cells. Only one study has been found that describes the incidence of agglutination of erythrocytes from cancer patients using a monoclonal antibody, which detected an epitope on the RBC from cancer patients and was considered to be distinct from the antigen bound by naturally occurring anti-T. Studies have been made describing polyagglutinable sites on breast cancer tumor cells, where there was a much higher incidence. This discrepancy can be explained either by a difference in the methods used to search for cryptantigen exposure on the various types of cells, or by the existence of a different mechanism, which causes the exposure of cryptantigens on RBC as opposed to malignant breast tumor cells.\r"

B1.1 (anti-CEA MoAb) was expressed in a minor percentage of cells of the invasive component of some primary melanomas, and weak to moderately in scattered metastic melanoma cells. MoAb HMB-45 prepared against melanocytic tumors reacted with over 90% of all tumors studied, being weakly reactive in one, and nonreactive in four metastases. This antibody stained some primary melanomas and their dysplastic nevus components in a heterogeneous manner, but was largely nonreactive in deep dermal nevus cells that were in association with invasive melanoma, enabling recognition of the deepest penetration of melanoma cells in the dermal nevus component. MoAb HMB-45 appears specific for melanoma cells, with no cross-reactivity with nonnevomelanocytic malignant tumors (unlike polyclonal anti-S-100 protein). MoAb HMB-45 is more sensitive in detecting malignant melanoma cell heterogeneity than anti-S-100 protein.\r"

Livers with cholangiocellular carcinoma were closely associated with hyperplasia (100%), atypical hyperplasia (77.8%), and carcinoma in situ (51.9%). Transition from hyperplasia to atypical hyperplasia, and from atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma, was often observed. In the controls, hyperplasia was frequent in those older than 30 years of age, whereas carcinoma was frequent in patients from 50 to 80 years of age. Of the intrahepatic bile ducts examined, the large duct showed the highest incidence of hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, and carcinoma in situ. All 27 cases of cholangiocellular carcinoma originated in, or near, the hilus of the liver. These findings suggest that cholangiocellular carcinoma frequently develops from bile duct hyperplasia.\r"

Disturbances of the microcirculation (67%), mainly of the fingers and toes (53%), were the most frequent thromboembolic symptoms. The mean age of all patients was 58 years (male patients, 61 years; female patients, 56 years). The average platelet count at diagnosis was 897,000/microliter. The average maximal platelet count was 1.231 X 10(6)/microliter (range, 500,000/microliter to 4 X 10(6)/microliter). Seventy-two percent had a moderate leukocytosis (average, 12,400/microliter), 34% a splenomegaly, 29% a hepatomegaly. Signs of hypermetabolism were infrequent, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid elevations, if present, were moderate. Bleeding time and viscosity were normal in most patients. Spontaneous platelet aggregation was increased in 81% of patients (n = 40). Platelet aggregation studies with the aggregation inducing substances adenosine diphosphonate (ADP), platelet activating factor (PAF), thrombin, collagen, and adrenalin showed hypoaggregation in most patients. Adrenalin-induced aggregation distinguished best between ET-patients and reactive thrombocytosis showing hypoaggregation in all ET-patients tested (n = 16) and in none of 22 controls. Bone marrow studies were performed in 57 patients. The histologic studies (done in 49 patients) were consistent with a chronic myeloproliferative disorder in all cases. In 41 cases (84%) the picture of a megakaryocytic myelosis was found, in 12 of these a granulocyte-rich form of megakaryocytic myelosis. Cytologic studies only (eight patients) did not differentiate ET well from reactive thrombocytosis. Platelet aggregation studies and bone marrow histology may be of help in the diagnosis of difficult cases of thrombocytosis. The Philadelphia status was negative in all cases studied (14 patients). Fourteen patients died. The causes of death were thromboembolic complications in probably 11 and acute leukemia in two patients. The probability of 10-year survival is 64% after a mean follow-up time of approximately 5 years. It appears that considering the average age of ET patients at diagnosis, life expectancy is close to normal.\r"

The study was therefore expanded to an additional group of children, including some diagnosed by noninvasive procedures and given chemotherapy before the excision of their tumors. In this second group 12 of 20 specimens contained ferritin and hemosiderin in variable amounts. In both groups there was a tendency for patients with advanced disease to have increased amounts of iron compounds in the tumor tissue (Stage III and particularly Stage IV). Most Stage IV patients also had elevated serum ferritin levels. However, based on the available heterogenous material, no absolute relationship could be established between age, disease stage, tumoral storage iron, and the level of serum ferritin. The presence of ferritin in neuroblastoma may be linked to the elevated serum ferritin levels and may be implicated in tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88210233\r", 
  ".W": "The hallmarks of diagnosis of medullary breast cancer (MedBC) used by the authors since 1977 have been that the tumor is well circumscribed, has syncytial architecture in greater than 75% of its surface, contains diffuse inflammatory infiltrate, has atypical nuclei, and forms no glandular pattern. In order to assess the clinical utility of these criteria, we studied a series of 95 previously untreated, surgically operable patients with breast carcinoma at the Institut Gustave-Roussy (IGR) between 1960 and 1979. A diagnosis of MedBC was initially made for these patients or suspected based on abundant inflammatory stroma observed in a histologic evaluation. Using these criteria, 26 cases were identified as typical medullary carcinoma (TMC), 23 cases as atypical medullary carcinoma (AMC), and 46 cases as nonmedullary carcinoma (NMC). The 26 cases of TMC represent a very small fraction of the total infiltrating operable breast carcinomas diagnosed at IGR during the same time period. The prognosis for these 26 patients was much more favorable than for the other groups. They had a 10-year disease-free survival of 92% compared with 53% for the AMC group and 51% for the NMC group. Neither distant metastasis nor secondary primaries of the same histology were seen. Therefore, it is possible with the use of strict histologic criteria to distinguish a group of patients with a much more favorable prognosis. This histologic diagnosis alone renders a most favorable prognosis for the patient even if other factors such as large tumor size and lymph node involvement are present and, by inference, the only therapy needed is the removal of all tumor. In contrast, atypical forms have a prognosis no different from other atypical types of breast carcinomas without inflammatory stroma, and adjuvant therapy appears to be justified if other factors warrant it.\r"

The remaining four patients with Stage III disease had aneuploid endometrial and ovarian carcinomas with identical DNA indices. These data support a single neoplastic process with metastasis in the latter four patients. There was good correlation with the clinicopathologic impression on the likelihood of synchronous primaries versus metastatic neoplasms.

  ".W": "Two extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas with a solid soft tissue mass occurred on the right upper arm of a 4-year-old boy and on the chest wall of a 1-year-old boy. Microscopically, both tumors were characterized by lobular configuration and were sparsely cellular with a background of myxoid matrix. The cells were small and round, and appeared undifferentiated, sometimes with a narrow eosinophilic cytoplasm. They grew in nests or strands and sometimes in a single file. They were strongly positive for S-100 protein and vimentin. Ultrastructural features suggested that the cells had a poorly differentiated mesenchymal nature with chondrocytic differentiation. These are the sixth and seventh reported cases of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma occurring in children. There are definite differences between this tumor with immature features and the extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma in adults. Problems of differential diagnoses from other small round cell sarcomas also are discussed.\r"

The age-specific incidence rate was 66 in 100,000 for breast cancer and 165.2 in 100,000 for benign breast disease. Native European or American women and native Israeli women had significantly higher age standardized incidence rates of both breast cancer and BPM, but not of FA, as compared to African/Asian-born women (P less than 0.01). Age-related ratios between invasive to precursor breast lesions were similar in all ethnic groups. The data suggest that breast cancer and benign proliferative mastopathy may have a common etiologic component.\r"

A close postoperative surveillance program was followed by only a few patients, but compliance improved with longer follow-up intervals. Metachronous polyps were observed with similar frequency in patients with benign polyps (34.8%) and those with polyps containing severe atypia (23.8%) or cancer (41.7%). Patients in whom malignant polyps were endoscopically removed had a 5-year survival rate of 84.3% that did not differ from that of patients' whose polyps contained severe atypia (79.0%). It was concluded that endoscopic removal of malignant polyps with favorable histologic conditions does not impair survival. The follow-up program of these patients should be adapted to that of patients with benign polyps, a procedure that may even improve patient compliance.\r"

Twenty-two patients with such a recurrence were examined between January 1963 and December 1986 at our institution. This event is associated with a higher initial surgical stage and tumor grade. Supraclavicular and inguinal recurrences occur with equal frequency. Axillary recurrences are rare. Overall, 15 patients achieved local control of the nodal recurrence, including all seven patients treated by excision and aggressive local irradiation. Of the seven patients with uncontrolled local disease, four experienced significant local morbidity. Initial supraclavicular recurrence seems to be associated with subsequent systemic progression, whereas initial inguinal recurrence seems to be associated with subsequent abdominal progression. Although the median survival after isolated peripheral lymph node recurrence is only 19 months, six patients are alive without evidence of cancer at a median follow-up of 27 months. Although an effective systemic adjuvant treatment for these patients is needed, aggressive local treatment after thorough restaging can provide long-term, disease-free survival.\r"

  ".U": "88210245\r", 
  ".W": "This article that reports on 70 consecutive patients is one of only a few studies of advanced ovarian cancer that have attempted to define predictive factors associated with survival duration after second-look laparotomy. As in many other investigations, several factors have been analyzed for predicting second-look outcome. The prognostic variables analyzed in this study included age, stage, histologic grade, residual disease status after initial surgery, and type (cisplatin versus no cisplatin) and number of cycles of chemotherapy. Only stage (P = 0.002) and optimal disease (less than 2 cm residual tumor size) after initial surgery (P less than 0.001) were significantly associated with the absence of disease at second-look laparotomy, and both were significant predictors of second-look outcome in a multivariate logistic regression model. Their impact on actuarial survival after second-look laparotomy diminished, however. Actuarial survival after second-look laparotomy was associated with residual tumor size at second-look surgery (P = 0.02). According to second-look findings, the 3-year actuarial survival rates and standard errors were as follows: no pathologic evidence of disease, 80.7% +/- 13.4% 3-year survival; microscopic disease plus less than or equal to 2 cm residual disease, 49.1% +/- 13.1% survival; and gross residual disease (i.e., greater than 2 cm maximum tumor diameter), 29.5% +/- 11.4% survival. We also examined the effect of extensive tumor resection at second-look laparotomy on survival for patients with greater than 2 cm gross residual disease. Optimum resection (less than 2 cm residual tumor mass) resulted in significantly greater survival than suboptimum resection (P less than 0.001). This strongly suggests that there is a survival advantage associated with optimum resection at second-look laparotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic studies of diet and pancreas cancer are few, and include ecologic comparisons and a limited number of prospective and case-control studies. Foods and/or nutrients that have been suggested to be associated with increased risk of this cancer include total fat intake, eggs, animal protein, sugar, meat, coffee and butter. Consumption of raw fruits and vegetables has been consistently associated with decreased risk. Dietary habits and medical history variables were evaluated in a prospective study of fatal pancreas cancer among 34,000 California Seventh-day Adventists between 1976 and 1983. Forty deaths from pancreas cancer occurred during the follow-up period. Compared to all US whites, Adventists experienced decreased risk from pancreas cancer death (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 72 for men; 90 for women), which was not statistically significant. Although there was a suggestive relationship between increasing meat, egg, and coffee consumption and increased pancreatic cancer risk, these variables were not significantly related to risk after controlling for cigarette smoking. However, increasing consumption of vegetarian protein products, beans, lentils, and peas as well as dried fruit was associated with highly significant protective relationships to pancreas cancer risk. A prior history of diabetes was associated with increased risk of subsequent fatal pancreas cancer, as was a history of surgery for peptic or duodenal ulcer. A history of tonsillectomy was associated with a slight, nonsignificant protective relationship as was history of various allergic reactions. These findings suggest that the protective relationships associated with frequent consumption of vegetables and fruits high in protease-inhibitor content are more important than any increase in pancreas cancer risk attendant on frequent consumption of meat or other animal products. Furthermore, the previously reported positive associations between diabetes and abdominal surgery and pancreas cancer risk are supported in these data.\r"

Analyses of age, period, and cohort variables focused on the curvature components, which are estimable functions. Statistical modeling demonstrated the following: (1) incidence rates have increased by birth cohort in both sexes with no requirement for a period variable, regardless of whether data are examined by 10-year, 5-year, or 1-year intervals of diagnosis; (2) this pattern in incidence rates differed from the patterns of change in the two indices of case ascertainment, the proportion of cases confirmed microscopically and the proportion of cases in localized stage, both of which exhibited changes by period of diagnosis rather than by birth cohort; and (3) adjustment for these two indices caused a downward bend in the cohort curve for females but not for males. The results suggested that much of the observed increase for this tumor was real.\r"

An aortofemoral graft will necessitate overdilatation of the femoral puncture site to allow adequate manipulation. If the puncture transverses both walls of the femoral limb of the graft into the native artery, further withdrawal of the catheter will allow reentry into the graft. When an aorta-to-external-iliac, end-to-side graft is present, transfemoral catheterization will frequently result in the guide wire or catheter tip terminating in the occluded common iliac artery. By choosing the proper catheter, entrance into the distal limb of the proximally communicating graft may be achieved. For the unwary operator, these confusing situations may result in failure to properly catheterize the graft. The methods of successfully overcoming these problems are discussed and illustrated.\r"

The technical parameters and implementation of a progressive scanning video system are discussed. Image quality, temporal and spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed using conventional interlaced and progressive video scanning. These comparisons documented improved resolution, no degradation of ejection fraction measurements, improved clinical images, and a 1.0-dB improvement in the SNR with the progressive scanning. Progressive scanning video systems reduce radiation exposure and provide an objective improvement in image quality over conventional scanning video systems.\r"

There were 26 males and three females with an age range of 31-82 (mean 57) years. Factors favoring PTCA at the time of initial coronary arteriography included clinical indications for revascularization, appropriate anatomy based on high-quality fluoroscopy, and availability of emergency surgery if required. Of 34 coronary lesions in 29 patients, 19 involved the anterior branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), eight the circumflex branch (Cx); and seven the right coronary artery (RCA). Five patients had two vessels dilated (one LAD + RCA, two LAD + Cx, and two RCA + Cx). Of the coronary artery lesions, 19 were concentric, seven were eccentric, 20 were single and discrete, six were long or multiple in the same vessel; eight vessels were totally occluded, and in nine patients there was good collateral circulation. Twenty-nine (85%) arteries were successfully dilated. Of the unsuccessful cases, one was from failure to cross a totally occluded lesion, and three residual lesions and/or postdilatation pressure gradients remained significant. One patient required emergency aortocoronary bypass surgery because of total occlusion of the LAD immediately post-PTCA. There were no postprocedural myocardial infarcts or deaths. It is concluded that, in selected patients with unstable angina, PTCA can be performed successfully and with low risk at the time of initial diagnostic coronary arteriography. This approach offers certain clinical financial advantages.\r"

Percutaneous dilation was performed on 63 patients with pulmonary stenosis (ages 3 months to 76 years, mean = 4.3 years). In 43 patients, a single balloon was used; in 20 patients two balloons were used simultaneously. The pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve was determined with right ventricular and main pulmonary artery catheters. Pressure gradients simultaneously were estimated by continuous wave Doppler (CWD) during catheterization. The peak systolic ejection gradient was obtained by both techniques both pre- and postangioplasty. There was excellent linear correlation between the simultaneous catheter pressure gradient and the pressure gradient estimated by Doppler (r = 0.99). Follow-up pressure gradient estimations by Doppler echocardiogram were obtained in 30 patients between 6 months and 30 months postcatheterization (mean = 13 months). The mean preangioplasty gradient of 64 mm Hg (range 30-160 mm Hg) was reduced to 22 mm Hg (range 2-31 mm Hg). A significant reduction of transvalvular gradient (52-95%, mean 68%) occurred in each patient. A linear correlation was found between the predilation gradient and the pressure gradient drop (r = 0.92). Mean follow-up gradient by Doppler was 20 mm Hg (range 0-31 mm Hg), and there was no significant difference between these gradients and the postdilation gradient. No important complications were noted. These data confirm that balloon dilation angioplasty for valvular pulmonary stenosis is safe and effective, and suggest that stenosis does not recur.\r"

The velocity of the leading edge of contrast material was therefore measured before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 15 patients utilizing digitized images from routine coronary angiography. The velocity (mean +/- SD) before percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the 15 patients was 11.9 +/- 6.0 cm/s, increasing to 21.7 +/- 8.7 cm/s after (P less than 0.01). There was a correlation between the percent change in velocity and the change in percent stenosis before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (r = 0.65; P less than 0.001). The mean absolute interobserver and intraobserver variabilities for the velocity measurements were 2.1 and 1.8 cm/s, respectively. Measurement of coronary flow velocity from data obtained at the time of routine coronary angiography is an easily performed reproducible technique, which may be used to assess the results of an intervention such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\r"

IV glucose tolerance test (glucose 0.33 g/kg BW) and platelet ATP content were evaluated in 16 patients before and after a single hemodialysis session with acetate 38 mEq/l in the dialysate. IV glucose tolerance was greatly impaired in all patients after hemodialysis (K: 1.08 +/- 0.30 vs predialysis value of 2.05 +/- 0.85, p less than 0.001). Platelet ATP content was unchanged by dialysis (3.74 +/- 1.02 mumol/10(11) PLTs before and 3.55 +/- 0.69 mumol/10(11) PLTs after), however, individual variations in platelet ATP content ranged from +32 to -31% of the initial values. Postdialysis plasma acetate levels ranged from 1.5 to 9.2 mmol/l and were inversely correlated with postdialysis glucose tolerance test (r: -0.61, p less than 0.01) and platelet ATP content variations (r: -0.51, p less than 0.05). Our study demonstrates that glucose utilization is acutely impaired by acetate dialysis and suggests that the reduced glycolytic activity may be due to a negative feed-back mechanism in the presence of exogenous fuel. It also demonstrates a great variability in platelet ATP content following hemodialysis, which probably depends on the different patients' ability to oxidize acetate.\r"

Electron microscopy revealed diffuse homogeneous thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. These histological findings were thought to be characteristic of the Cockayne's syndrome.

Eighty-nine percent of the patients treated by closed reduction methods had good to excellent functional results with a low complication rate (12%). Observations based on long-term roentgenographic examinations did not correlate with the functional end results. Many patients with less than satisfactory roentgenographic results had good to excellent functional long-term results. The indications for operative stabilization of these fractures should be based on testing for knee stability in full extension, rather than on any arbitrary roentgenographic criteria. For unstable fractures, closed reduction using ligamentotaxis and percutaneous fixation supplemented by cast brace support proved effective and relatively free of complications.\r"

Of 172 patients with symptoms of claudication and lumbar spinal stenosis proved by myelography or computed tomography (CT), nine had peripheral vascular disease identified with ultrasonography and arteriography. All of the nine patients had a laminectomy performed to decompress the narrow spinal canal, and two had an additional posterolateral fusion. Two patients were treated with an excision of their abdominal aortic aneurysm, while one of those patients later required a bypass graft for iliac stenosis. One patient had had an aortofemoral bypass graft, one a femoropopliteal graft, and one a lumbar sympathectomy. Follow-up study ranged from three to eight years, with an average of five years after their last surgical procedure. Paresthesias generally dissipated after the spinal surgery. The cramping-type discomfort associated with walking was not easily attributed either to vascular or a neurogenic etiology. Five patients had initial weakness, which invariably improved. A secondary etiology contributing to claudication must be excluded in those patients with persistent discomfort following previous lumbar spinal or vascular surgery for arterial insufficiency.\r"

When long facet fusions are required, however, it may be impossible to obtain adequate length and shape of the grafts to bridge the desired fusion area. A technique is described that eliminates this problem by substituting thin Harrington compression rods for the autologeneic corticocancellous struts, and using cancellous and corticocancellous bone graft to achieve fusion.\r"

In eight specimens of the spine collected from 35 patients with ankylosing spondylitis showing extensive discovetebral destructive lesions, a detailed pathologic study revealed a consistent picture of complete or near-complete destruction of the disc-bone border and the intervertebral disc. The disc was replaced by fibrous tissue and/or fibrocartilage showing moderate to severe fibrinoid necrosis and cystic degeneration. Such changes are characteristic of pseudarthrosis, which may follow either fracture or degeneration of the disc perpetuated by abnormal stress and motion. The reparative process included fibrovascular tissue proliferation from the vertebral bone marrow. Fibrovascular tissue also perforated the vertebral end-plate and intervertebral spaces resulting in massive discovertebral destruction. Pathologic observations strongly implicate mechanical trauma and pseudarthrosis as initiating and perpetuating extensive discovertebral destruction in ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

Thirty-five knees had no weight-bearing pain, six knees had slight pain, three knees had moderate pain, and eight knees had revisions. Except for one complication from infection, all the poor results (eight revisions and three knees with moderate pain) in terms of pain can be explained by mechanical causes, i.e., femorotibial subluxation, loosening of the tibial component, or narrowing of the nonprosthetic femorotibial space. Because the cause of these poor results appears to be due to malposition of the prosthesis component, or to components that are too thick with an inadequate mechanical axis, the precision of the surgical procedure is important.\r"

On the basis of these definitions, 51% of the results were good, 9% were fair, 4% were poor, and 36% were failed. Results were satisfactory in 94% at two years, 87% at five years, and 69% at ten years. The absolute amount of angular correction did not correlate with the results. The change in axial alignment with time was unpredictable. Gender and age of patient were not factors in the outcome, although women seemed to require a longer period to become support-free. Better long-term results were obtained if the correction was to 10 degrees or more of anatomic valgus.\r"

Lengthenings included 15 femora (six acquired, eight congenital, and one fibrous dysplasia), four tibiae, and two humeri (one acquired and one congenital). Average femoral lengthening was 6.6 cm; tibial, 5.9 cm; and humeral, 9.7 cm. Lengthening of femora with congenital shortening (6.5 cm) was nearly the same as femora with acquired shortening (6.8 cm), and 85% of all lengthenings were greater than 5 cm. Humeri were lengthened more than 50%. Seventy-two percent of patients were in the 50th percentile or less of stature; 61% were in the 15th percentile or less of stature. Seventy-five percent had complications, with 65% having more than one major complication: pin tract and superficial infections in 40%; deep infections in 20%. All infections were in femoral lengthenings. Nonunion occurred in two patients (10%), and fracture after plate removal in two patients (10%). Five patients (25%) had nerve palsies, and four of these resolved without treatment. Malunion rate was 20%. Five patients developed joint contractures. Complications did not correlate with amount of lengthening but congenital deformities had a higher incidence of complication. Eleven patients required 19 additional procedures necessitated by the lengthening procedure. Wagner leg lengthening is generally recommended when amputation is only other surgical alternative and a full, complete informed consent is given to the parents and patient.\r"

INSC is mildly effective and more convenient than parenteral SC, but dose response and efficacy relative to parenteral SC have not been established, thereby raising questions of cost-effectiveness.\r"

Plain roentgenographs immediately after perfusion revealed that the dye promptly escaped from the marrow into the general systemic circulation through a number of large transcortical routes. The periosteal veins were shown as a delicate network of venules lying on the external surface of the shaft. The perfused dye appeared diffusely scattered throughout the whole width of the medullary canal and extended from metaphysis to metaphysis suggesting the marrow to be an open circulatory system with ill-defined boundaries. A central venous sinus, as commonly perceived, was not demonstrated. Microradiographs revealed an extensive network of cortical sinusoids and venules that were continuous with similar vessels within the marrow and on the external surface of the bone. The injected dye also perfused the haversian venules. Intersinusoidal shunts, fine efferent vessels that did not combine to form larger venules, were observed within the marrow. The principal nutrient veins and their radicles were not demonstrated by this technique.\r"

In Group 2, one knee joint from each dog was sterilized using ethylene oxide, freeze-dried, and then stored at room temperature for four to five weeks prior to mechanical testing. In both groups, the contralateral joint was tested fresh and used as a control. The bone-ligament-bone preparations were loaded in tension until failure and the load at failure, stiffness, and maximum elongation were measured. No preparation method caused a significant decline in breaking strength. In both groups, however, there was a significant increase in elongation at failure noted in the test specimens. This was accompanied, in Group 1 (deep-frozen), by a significant decrease in stiffness in the test joints. A similar trend toward decreased stiffness was observed in the test joints from Group 2 (freeze-dried).\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between extracellular matrix vesicles and the calcifying fronts was examined by studying vesicular diameters and types. Transmission electron microscopy combined with computerized morphometry three weeks after injury to the tibial bone in rats was used. The different vesicle types were defined as: (1) vesicles with electron lucent contents referred to as empty; (2) vesicles with amorphous electron opaque contents, called amorphic; (3) vesicles containing crystalline depositions, called crystalline; and (4) vesicles containing crystalline structures with ruptured membranes, referred to as ruptured. The diameters of most vesicles ranged between 0.07 and 0.17 micron. More than 95% of the vesicles were located less than 2 micron from the calcified front. The vesicles were distributed among the categories as follows: empty, 9.6%; amorphic, 19.3%; crystal, 39.2%; and ruptured, 31.9%, respectively. The diameters of the crystalline and ruptured vesicles were significantly larger than those of the empty and amorphic types. The ruptured type had the largest diameters. The sequence of distances from the calcified front was recorded as follows: ruptured, crystalline, amorphic, and empty, with the ruptured and crystalline types being the closest to the front. This study supports the accepted theory on matrix vesicle mineralization. The cell is responsible for secretion of empty vesicles that accumulate amorphous Ca and Pi to form a hydroxyapatite crystal. This is followed by rupture of the vesicular membrane. The propagation of the process is accompanied by an increase in the vesicular diameter and its approximation to the calcifying front.\r"

The implants were placed transcortically in the femora of adult mongrel dogs and evaluated after periods of three, six, and 12 weeks. The HA coating was applied using a modified plasma spray process to samples with pore volume and pore size of the porous coating expanded to equal the pore morphology of uncoated porous specimens. Mechanical push-out testing revealed that the bone-porous material interface shear strength increased with time in situ for both the uncoated and HA-coated implants. The use of the HA coating on porous titanium, however, did not significantly increase attachment strength. Histologic and microradiographic sections yielded similar qualitative results in the amount of bone grown into each system. After three weeks, both systems displayed primarily woven bone occupying approximately 50% of the available porous structure. Six and 12 weeks postimplantation, each system displayed more extensive bone ingrowth, organization, and mineralization, with only limited areas of immature bone. Histologically, differences were noted at the ingrown bone-porous material interface between the two implant types. The HA coating supported mineralization directly onto its surface, and a thin osseous layer was found lining all HA-coated surfaces. An extremely thin fibrous layer was observed separating the uncoated titanium particle surface from ingrown bone. There was no extensive direct apposition or lining of the ingrown bone to the uncoated porous titanium particle surfaces.\r"

An initial roentgenographic evaluation with accurate delineation of all fracture lines provides the key to decisions about whether to give closed or open treatment. When open treatment is indicated, a surgical approach can be chosen that will almost always lead to reduction without the necessity of a second approach. The authors have found that the Kocher-Langenbeck, ilioinguinal, and extended iliofemoral approaches are the most useful. A fracture table and specialized reduction instruments aid fracture reduction and fixation. Satisfactory operative reduction of the fracture is the factor that correlates best with a satisfactory clinical result. The rate of satisfactory operative reductions improved gradually over the first 50 operations of a prospective study of 121 displaced acetabular fractures. Overall, there were 80% satisfactory clinical results in this series. Complications included a 3% infection rate and a 5% incidence of nerve palsy. Open reduction and internal fixation are indicated for the majority of displaced fractures. However, closed treatment can produce satisfactory results in selected patients.\r"

To address this dilemma, the authors report a prospective study of 202 consecutive Grade III tibial fractures. All injuries were treated under protocol at the authors' university with primary external fixation and serial debridement. Equinus deformity was prevented with a new tibiometatarsal frame extension. Severe injuries crossing the ankle or knee were temporarily stabilized with external fixation across these joints. Staged reconstruction of soft tissue and then bone was undertaken for 176 of these tibias in patients who survived their multiple injuries. Reconstructive procedures included skin grafts in 57%, muscle flaps in 32%, and bone grafts in 28%. Gastrosoleus myocutaneous flaps were successful in 92% of cases versus 66% for free flaps. Late follow-up data were obtained for 171 (97%). Infection occurred in 15% and led to amputation in 7%. The infection rate was reduced to 9% in the second half of the series largely by removal of all necrotic bone prior to wound coverage. Angulation (greater than 10 degrees) in 9% and delayed union were lessened with early posterolateral grafting followed by progressive fracture loading in the fixator. A 9% incidence of pin tract drainage or loosening was reduced with predrilling and diaphyseal half pins. The time to fixator removal averaged 87 days. Ninety-three percent of the fractures united (median time, nine months) but healing times varied widely according to the amount of tissue injury and bone loss. Eighty-nine percent had satisfactory late clinical function. Results from this study, the largest series of open Grade III tibial fractures reported to date, suggest that successful staged reconstruction is now a reasonable expectation for most of these severe injuries.\r"

The interventions were: 1) an educational program; and later, 2) a recorded message that revealed the phone number for a second call to reach the pediatrician. The call rate remained the same before and after the educational intervention alone, but after the recorded message was inaugurated, the rate declined 28 percent. After-hours emergency room visits were similar before and after each intervention. This study suggests a simple strategy to modestly reduce after-hours calls.\r"

This practice assumes that the apparent first dissociation constant for carbon dioxide in serum, pK'1, is invariable in clinical situations. This assumption has been questioned recently. Our study examined arterial blood samples from 50 acutely ill patients who were routinely sent for blood gas analysis. The pH and pCO2 were measured on a blood gas analyzer and the total CO2 was determined on the same blood sample using a microgasometer. The calculated pK'1 from these parameters was 6.10 +/- 0.018 (m +/- SD) with a range of 6.06 to 6.15. This amount of variability could be explained by the error in the methods. The correlation for calculated to measured total CO2 was y = 094x + 1.81, r = 0.98, p less than 0.001. These findings indicate that pK'1 is functionally fixed in clinical practice and that the methods used to calculate serum bicarbonate are acceptable.\r"

Ibuprofen proved to be the safest of these nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; it was associated with no AST elevation that was considered probably drug related as determined by application of the algorithm to laboratory values and information from case report forms. The frequency of probably drug-related AST elevations was highest (5%) with aspirin; with oxaprozin, an investigational nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, the incidence (3%) fell between that for the other two agents. Thus our findings on the hepatic safety of ibuprofen are consistent with those in the medical literature.\r"

Concentrations of the active S-enantiomer in synovial fluid exceeded those of the R-enantiomer at all times in all patients with the ratio of S to R concentrations being 2.1 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SE). Synovial fluid concentrations fluctuated much less than in plasma and exceeded plasma concentrations from 5.4 +/- 0.3 hours for R-ibuprofen and 5.5 +/- 0.6 hours for S-ibuprofen. Pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that, although the enantiomers diffuse into synovial fluid primarily in the unbound form, there may be significant diffusion of the enantiomers out of synovial fluid in the protein-bound form in some patients. Interpatient differences in the disposition of the enantiomers of ibuprofen in synovial fluid were evident and may contribute to the interindividual variability in response to treatment with ibuprofen.\r"

We investigated the effects of tobacco abstinence on the rate and pattern of caffeine metabolism in nine habitual smokers who consumed six cups of coffee per day, each cup containing 2 mg/kg caffeine. Abstinence from smoking for 4 days resulted in a 46% increase in the 24-hour AUC. Thus, significant, although probably not complete, normalization of the enzyme-inducing effects of cigarette smoking can be seen after 4 days abstinence. During abstinence, 24-hour urine ratios of dimethylxanthines to caffeine and mono-dimethylxanthines to dimethylxanthines were reduced, suggesting that cigarette smoking accelerates both demethylation steps. Other metabolic pathways were unaffected.\r"

Increasing infusions of dobutamine produced reproducible dose-dependent reductions in systolic time intervals and increases in systolic blood pressures, these responses representing positive inotropic effects of dobutamine. These effects of dobutamine were unaffected 2 hours after administration by 10 mg ICI 118,551 and minimally by 20 mg; the 50 mg dose attenuated the systolic time interval effect whereas the 100 mg dose attenuated further the systolic time interval reduction and also the increase in systolic blood pressure.

Intrinsic clearance of unbound imipramine was greater in the alcoholic group (19.80 vs. 6.56 L/hr/kg; P less than 0.05), as was the intrinsic clearance of unbound desipramine (14.52 vs. 9.05 L/hr/kg; P less than 0.05). The mean elimination half-life for imipramine was significantly decreased in alcoholics (8.7 vs. 19.9 hours after intravenous infusion and 10.9 vs. 19.6 hours after oral administration; P less than 0.05). The mean elimination half-life for desipramine was decreased in alcoholics after intravenous infusion (16.5 vs. 22.4 hours; P less than 0.05). Unbound fractions of drug in plasma were decreased in the alcoholic group for both imipramine and desipramine after both routes of administration. alpha 1-Acid glycoprotein levels were elevated in the alcoholic group whereas total protein and albumin levels did not differ between groups. These findings suggest that recently detoxified alcoholics may require higher doses of imipramine than do nonalcoholic subjects. Desipramine clearance was affected to a lesser degree than imipramine, suggesting that from a pharmacokinetic standpoint it may be the preferred drug for the treatment of alcoholics with depression. Periodic monitoring of plasma levels may be required for recently abstinent alcoholics treated with antidepressants.\r"

  ".U": "88210994\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in cardiac performance in response to epinephrine administered by graded infusion were assessed by M-mode echocardiography in normotensive healthy subjects after pretreatment with placebo, the beta 1-selective blocker atenolol, or the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol. Epinephrine alone increased heart rate and left ventricular end diastolic dimension and decreased left ventricular end systolic dimension. Left ventricular performance as assessed by fractional shortening and systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume (P/V) ratio was also increased. Atenolol pretreatment did not significantly affect the increase in heart rate by epinephrine. However, atenolol did prevent the effects of epinephrine on left ventricular dimensions and left ventricular performance at the lower infusion rates and significantly blunted these effects at the highest infusion rate. After propranolol, epinephrine significantly decreased left ventricular end diastolic dimension despite decreasing heart rate and left ventricular emptying (associated with a high afterload). P/V ratio remained unchanged. These results indicate that beta 2-receptors may play a major role in the increase in heart rate caused by epinephrine. In contrast, epinephrine's positive inotropic effect appears to be mediated primarily via beta 1-receptors and, at higher concentrations, possibly also through beta 2-receptors. The pattern of changes in left ventricular end diastolic dimension suggests that epinephrine increases venous return via both beta 1- and beta 2-receptor stimulation and that alpha-receptor stimulation (epinephrine after propranolol) may actually decrease venous return.\r"

Standard subjective measures were used to evaluate analgesia. Eight-hour sum of pain intensity differences and total pain relief scores for all active treatments were significantly better than were those for placebo (p less than 0.05). Diflunisal plus codeine performed the best followed by diflunisal, codeine, and placebo. Diflunisal plus codeine was better than placebo from 1 1/2 to 8 hours (p less than 0.01), better than codeine from 1 1/2 to 6 hours (p less than 0.05), and better than diflunisal alone from 1/2 to 1 1/2 hours (p less than 0.05) for most measures of analgesia. Factorial analysis demonstrated a significant early codeine effect and a significant diflunisal effect throughout. No significant treatment group differences were observed regarding adverse effects. Our data demonstrate that diflunisal plus codeine is generally well tolerated and provides analgesia superior to that of diflunisal or codeine alone in the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain.\r"

The plasma half-life (43.6 vs 27.5 hours) and AUC (9.9 +/- 2.1 vs 6.0 +/- 1.6 micrograms.hr/ml) were significantly (p less than 0.05) increased in the patient population. No significant differences were noted in the maximum rimantadine concentration, time of maximum concentration, or apparent volume of distribution. Urinary excretion of unchanged rimantadine accounted for 16% of the dose in the healthy subjects. Hemodialysis did not appreciably remove rimantadine. These findings suggest that rimantadine dosage may need to be reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease but supplemental doses on dialysis days are not required.\r"

We measured systemic vancomycin clearance simultaneously with the renal clearances of vancomycin, creatinine, inulin, and para-aminohippurate in nine healthy subjects at steady-state serum vancomycin concentrations of 7 and 14 mg/L. For all steady-state observations the renal clearance of vancomycin was 89 +/- 11 ml/min (mean +/- SE), the clearance of inulin 105 +/- 9 ml/min, the clearance of creatinine 117 +/- 9 ml/min, and the clearance of para-aminohippuric acid 496 +/- 41 ml/min. The systemic clearance of vancomycin was 131 +/- 7 ml/min. The clearances of creatinine, inulin, and para-aminohippuric acid and the renal clearance of vancomycin were not statistically different at both steady-state vancomycin concentrations. The ratio of the renal clearance of vancomycin to the clearance of inulin was 0.89 +/- 0.06 and to creatinine clearance 0.79 +/- 0.05. Both ratios were independent of vancomycin concentration, urine flow rate, and filtration fraction. The systemic clearance of vancomycin was 10% greater at serum vancomycin concentrations of 14 mg/L than at 7 mg/L (p less than 0.05) because of an increase in the nonrenal clearance. Therefore in healthy subjects, 30% of the systemic vancomycin clearance is by nonrenal mechanisms and this nonrenal clearance is concentration dependent. Assuming protein binding to be between 10% and 20%, renal vancomycin excretion is predominantly by glomerular filtration. Small amounts of tubular vancomycin transport cannot be excluded by these techniques.\r"

After treatment with 800 mg quinidine daily for 2 days, excretion of 2-OH-DMI decreased by 96% in rapid hydroxylators and 68% in slow hydroxylators. After treatment with 750 mg quinine/day for 2 days, excretion of 2-OH-DMI in rapid hydroxylators was 54% lower than during the control experiment, whereas in slow hydroxylators no significant changes in the excretion pattern were observed. Unchanged DMI constituted only a minor fraction of recovered drug and no significant changes in its recovery were observed in either phenotypic group after pretreatment with quinidine or quinine. Thus both quinidine and quinine decreased the excretion of 2-OH-DMI. At similar does the effect of quinidine was much stronger than that of quinine, virtually transforming rapid hydroxylators into slow hydroxylators. The mechanism probably involves a stereoselective inhibition of DMI 2-hydroxylation.\r"

  ".W": "A single-dose comparative evaluation in young normotensive men of the plasma concentrations and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism after conventional prazosin and a new slow-release formulation (Oros) is described. Whereas conventional prazosin (2 mg) produced a maximum reduction in erect blood pressure at 3 hours (80/46 mm Hg compared with 110/65 mm Hg with placebo), the lowest blood pressure of 94/48 mm Hg with Oros prazosin (5.5 mg) was not observed until 8 hours after administration. Twenty-four hours after Oros prazosin, prazosin was still detectable in plasma and erect blood pressure was reduced to 107/58 mm Hg compared with 110/71 mm Hg after placebo. alpha 1-Antagonism (assessed by the pressor responses to intravenous phenylephrine) was maximal, with a 4.8-fold shift in dose-response 24 hours after Oros prazosin, and persisted at least until 30 hours after administration, with a 2.3-fold shift. There were significant correlations between alpha 1-antagonism and plasma prazosin concentrations for both Oros and conventional prazosin. The slopes of these relationships were significantly different, but this is thought to be consistent with the differences in the rates of drug release from the two formulations. Overall this study provides further evidence in humans that the duration and extent of the alpha 1-antagonism and the blood pressure response reflect the plasma prazosin concentrations. Additionally these data suggest the potential suitability of this type of a slow-release formulation for single daily administration.\r"

Fewer than one third of patients achieve 6MP plasma concentrations known to be cytocidal in vitro (greater than 1 mumol/L). Studies in vitro have suggested that first-pass metabolism can be saturated at higher doses of 6MP. To determine whether saturation occurs in vivo at clinically used doses and whether bioavailability can be enhanced by increasing the dose, the bioavailability of different doses of 6MP was studied first in rhesus monkeys and then in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission. In monkeys a higher dose of 6MP resulted in enhanced bioavailability, whereas in patients the mean relative bioavailability at the higher dose was significantly less. However, all patients achieved cytocidal (greater than 1 to 10 mumol/L) plasma concentrations at the higher dose without manifesting significant clinical toxicity. Therefore cytocidal levels of 6MP can be achieved in patients with oral 6MP without the risk of unexpectedly high levels caused by saturation of first-pass metabolism.\r"

The tests were performed on the back at 3 sites: untreated skin, skin pre-treated with occlusion and skin pre-delipidized. Irritant reactions were elicited applying 0.5% and 2.0% SLS via Finn chamber patch tests and monitored by means of laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum water content (WC). Higher TEWL, LDV, and WC values were recorded for 2.0% SLS when compared to 0.5% SLS and baselines. Pre-treatment with short-term occlusion generally increased values, while delipidization produced flattening of the data more detectable in whites than in blacks. Significant TEWL differences for the two concentrations were recorded in whites for the occluded site (P less than 0.02) while in blacks in the untreated (P less than 0.04) and delipidized (P less than 0.03) sites. LDV revealed significant changes in the untreated and pre-occluded white skin (P less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). In blacks, the values were significantly different only in the pre-occluded skin (P less than 0.01). Water content correlated with the visual score and was greatly increased in sites with strongly positive reactions (P less than 0.01). It appears that there are significant differences in the modulation of irritation, in the behavior of water barrier function and of the erythematous response between blacks and whites. Clinical correlations are discussed.\r"

Statistically significant positive correlations were found between the minimal blistering time to ammonium hydroxide and the area bounded by the skin surface contour line as determined by a skin surface replica technique. A significant positive correlation was also found between the minimal irritancy dose of dithranol and (a) the mean corneocyte area, and (b) the mean epidermal thickness in cell numbers. Mean corneocyte area was also found to increase with age and to be significantly less in UV-sensitive Types I and II subjects than in the relatively UV-insensitive Types III and IV subjects. These correlations are further evidence that there are inherent structural differences in the skin which influence the way the skin reacts to chemical trauma.\r"

When 5 patients were tested with a series of imidazoles in different concentrations and vehicles (petrolatum, ethyl methyl ketone, ethanol), petrolatum turned out to be the least effective one. The active ingredient at 1% in ethanol seems to be the most suitable choice for routine patch testing. Bifonazole may be the therapeutic alternative for patients sensitive to miconazole or clotrimazole, since no cross reactivity was observed.\r"

Another 16 (43%) workers had scars suggestive of previous chrome ulcers. Mucosal irritation was present in 57% of the workers. The most common was throat irritation (49%) followed by nasal irritation (41%). Mucosal irritation was more common in hard chrome platers, while skin ulcers and dermatitis were more common in bright chrome platers. Nasal septum perforation was seen in 1 worker. Skin ulceration appeared to be a more specific sign for occupational dermatosis in chrome platers than dermatitis when the prevalence rates were compared to controls. Of the 7 workers with chrome ulcers, only 1 was allergic to chromate. Of the 6 workers with dermatitis, 2 were allergic to chromate and 1 to nickel. The worker with ulceration and dermatitis was negative to chromate and nickel. Irritant factors are therefore important in the aetiology of contact dermatitis in these chrome platers.\r"

Definite positive reactions to products were seen from hair dyes (as is, open test) (6/12), cold permanent wave primary solutions (as is, open test) (7/13) and a shampoo (1% aq., closed test) (1/13).

Study of the prognosis showed that 5 out of 12 cases could continue their occupation, but 4 cases had persistent hand dermatitis despite protecting their hands from hair dyes with gloves, 7 cases quitted their jobs, and in 5 their hands healed while 2 cases continued to have atopic hand dermatitis. A personal or family history of atopy was frequent among the cases, so we recommend that those who have such a history should not become beauticians.\r"
