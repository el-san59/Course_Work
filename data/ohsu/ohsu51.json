When DL-methionine was added to Acremonium chrysogenum culture broths, no labeled ACV was found, while a large amount of radioactive ACV was detected when methionine was not present. DL-Norleucine, a nonsulfur analog of methionine, also inhibited the synthesis of radioactive ACV to some degree. This effect was due to the inhibition of valine transport by methionine and norleucine.\r"

  ".W": "After completion of treatment with growth hormone (GH) 19 patients with isolated 'idiopathic' GH deficiency and 15 with post-irradiation GH deficiency underwent retesting of GH secretion with an insulin tolerance test or an arginine stimulation test, or both. Patients with post-irradiation GH deficiency comprised 13 patients with central nervous system tumours distant from the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and two with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who had received cranial or craniospinal irradiation. All 15 patients with post-irradiation GH deficiency remained GH deficient (peak GH response less than 7 mU/l (n = 10) and 7-15 mU/l (n = 5)). Of the 19 retested patients with idiopathic GH deficiency, however, five (26%) had peak GH responses of greater than 15 mU/l (regarded now as transient or false idiopathic GH deficiency) and were indistinguishable from the remainder (permanent or true idiopathic GH deficiency, peak GH responses less than 7 mU/l (n = 12) and 7-15 mU/l (n = 2)), by pretreatment anthropometry and post-treatment height standard deviation score, but had a lower first year height velocity (mean (SD) velocity 5.6 (0.5) cm/year for false idiopathic deficiency v 8.7 (1.75) cm/year for true idiopathic deficiency, p less than 0.01) and height increment on treatment (mean (SD) increment 2.2 (1.5) cm/year for false idiopathic deficiency v 5.2 (2.3) cm/year for true idiopathic deficiency, p less than 0.05). By current practices two patients with false idiopathic deficiency may have been distinguished by sex steroid priming. Thus post-irradiation GH deficiency seems to be permanent, but errors in diagnosis in idiopathic GH deficiency are common.\r"

  ".W": "There is conflicting evidence about the effect of parental consanguinity on fetal growth. Previous studies have not always allowed for other factors that are known to affect birth weight, in particular, gestational age, parity, and maternal height. We have therefore studied this question in the Pakistani Moslem population in Birmingham. Babies born to parents who were first cousins were on average 80 g lighter than those born to unrelated parents, but this difference was not significant for the size of the sample studied. Nor were there any differences in the other measurements of the babies. After expressing birth weight in terms of centiles for gestational age, sex, parity, and maternal height, however, while there was no difference in the overall distribution of centiles, there were more poorly grown babies--that is, weight below the 10th centile--in the first cousin group. We conclude that parental consanguinity is associated with an increase in the number of poorly grown babies but that the overall effect on mean birth weight is small.\r"

Ranitidine was given as prophylaxis against gastrointestinal haemorrhage induced by tolazoline. Tolazoline 1-2 mg/kg caused significant falls in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances and a rise in heart rate. After intravenous administration of ranitidine 3 mg/kg both resistances rose again and neither resistance then differed significantly from baseline levels. Heart rate also fell and the final heart rate was significantly below baseline levels. We conclude that there may be H2 receptors within the pulmonary and systemic circulations and that tolazoline may mediate some of its effects through these H2 receptors rather than by alpha adrenergic receptor blockade. The safety of H2 blockade in children, particularly those with pulmonary hypertension, needs further investigation.\r"

The groups were similar in terms of age (range 4-14 years and mean 10.2 years). Peak expiratory flow and signs of allergy were correlated with family interaction in the subjects with asthma. The following significant findings were made. Family interaction was more disturbed in asthma compared with both the diabetic and the healthy groups. In most of the disturbed families interaction patterns were rigid and enmeshed, but a few showed chaotic and disengaged patterns. There was a negative correlation between peak expiratory flow and disturbed cohesion in non-steroid dependent cases. The severely ill children with asthma living in families with a normal cohesion score had higher IgE concentrations than children living in disturbed families. It is concluded that family interaction should be considered to be an important dimension in the investigation of severe childhood asthma.\r"

We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections.\r"

All the children had a highly significant reduction in total cholesterol, averaging -21.8% against the baseline after eight weeks. Compliance became less strict afterwards, but more than half of the patients have regularly continued the diet and results have been maintained for one year. Minimal changes were noted in triglyceridaemia and in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, which showed a slight rise only at the end of treatment. The children's growth during the trial was normal. In view of the psychological difficulties of prescribing treatment with drugs to children with severe hypercholesterolaemia before puberty and of the relative ineffectiveness of standard low lipid diets in this condition the soybean protein diet may offer a satisfactory alternative.\r"

In a group of 11 children two died in the acute stage of the illness and nine made an excellent recovery.

Measurements of blood flow velocity and vascular diameter were made along the venous limb of capillaries within the nailfold skin of the third finger via videomicroscopy before and for 5 min after the smoking of each cigarette. Capillary blood flow (CBF) was calculated as a product of capillary cross-sectional area and flow velocity. Resting pre-smoke CBF for all experiments combined averaged 4.7 X 10(4) mu 3/sec. All three cigarettes elicited a significant reduction in CBF with the maximal effect within the first 2 min of the post-smoke period (p less than or equal to .05). Respective CBF values during this time averaged 3.6, 3.4, and 2.7 mu 3/sec for the low-, medium-, and high-nicotine cigarettes. Although the data suggested a downward trend in CBF with increasing nicotine levels, the post-smoke values were not significantly different among the three cigarettes. It is concluded that acute tobacco smoke inhalation reduces CBF in human skin, but the effect is not related to the nicotine content of the cigarettes. The changes in cutaneous CBF observed with tobacco smoking are less compared to reported effects of smoke inhalation on total digital blood flow.\r"

Mercuric ion was reduced to metallic mercury in the presence of superoxide anion in vitro. The reduction rate of mercuric ion to metallic mercury in the presence of both superoxide anion and cytochrome C or nitro blue tetrazolium was higher than that in the presence of superoxide anion alone, and the reduction of mercuric ion by NADPH or NADH was also observed. The reduction of mercuric ion to metallic mercury by liver homogenates of acatalasemic mice was higher than that of normal mice.\r"

They were compared to controls exposed to saline aerosols or to atmospheric air. Both types of kerosene exposure engendered aortic plaques with fibrous tissue, collagen, and elastic fibers embedded in abundant glycosaminoglycans-rich ground substance, interspersed in which are smooth muscle cells resembling those seen in atherosclerosis, and changes in levels of blood lipids. The results suggest that chronic exposure to kerosene, a domestic fuel very widely used in many countries, may have important toxic effects in addition to the pulmonary effects that have been reported by others.\r"

Both stimuli increased mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly. However, cold was more powerful than glare as a diastolic pressor stimulus. Heart rate and corrected QT interval increased significantly during both tests. Professional and nonprofessional drivers who drove at night showed significantly greater diastolic BP responses to the glare pressor test than did non-driver subjects. Ventricular extrasystoles (VES) were recorded exclusively during the glare pressor test in two of six professional drivers with night driving exposure. The heart rate and QT responses reflect the individual's reactivity to sensory stress, regardless of modality or glare exposure. On the other hand, the greater diastolic response and appearance of VES in night driving subgroups during glare suggest a greater sensitivity to the glare pressor test in these subjects.\r"

To test our necropsy population we searched for pleural plaques (PPs); the optical count of both lung asbestos bodies (ABs) and uncoated mineral fibers (UMFs) at least 10 microns in length was recorded. In the adult autopsy population studied in the Turin area, the predictive value given by a positive test for large-size PPs (mostly bilateral) was about 55%. This level of probability did not rise in relation to the AB counts, whereas an increase to over 75% was observed if more than 10,000 UMFs/g dry lung were present. In subjects without PPs or with small-size plaque lesions (mostly unilateral), predictive values of positive tests were 20 to 30% when ABs and UMFs were found to be below 100 and 10,000/g, respectively, and increased to approximately 40% if the AB count exceeded 500/g and to almost 70% for an UMF count above 100,000/g. In subjects without PPs or with small-size plaque lesions, the probability of being nonexposed was greater than 90% if neither ABs nor UMFs were found. This autopsy screening may be a reliable tool in selecting cases most probably related to occupational exposure.\r"

The study included three study groups: two for controlled fluoridation and one for natural fluoride. Previous epidemiologic studies of fluoride in drinking water have rarely addressed other drinking water parameters. The results indicated that controlled fluoridation municipalities were more likely to have initiated other treatment practices such as chlorination. Natural fluoride drinking water concentrations were positively correlated with water source depth, and thereby related to other depth-associated variables such as radium 226, strontium, and nitrogen. Future epidemiologic studies evaluating the safety of fluoride in drinking water should address the potential for confounding by other water variables and treatment processes.\r"

  ".W": "Radical ablative surgery for upper extremity sarcoma often results in significant loss of function. With the recent emphasis on limb preservation, function-sparing excision has been combined with adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy in an increasing number of patients. To assess the effect of changing management on local recurrence rates and identify factors governing local failure, the records of 108 patients with operable, nonmetastatic soft tissue sarcoma of the upper extremity, treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1968 and 1978, were reviewed. Median follow-up care was 8.2 years. One third of the patients presented with locally recurrent tumors after initial treatment elsewhere. Over half of the lesions were above the elbow and 62% were high grade. Seventy-three patients (68%) had limb-sparing surgery (LSS), but margins were considered adequate in less than half. Local recurrence was directly related to the adequacy of the surgical margins and was significantly higher in the LSS patients (p = 0.008). Other factors associated with an increased risk of local failure included: presentation with local recurrence, superficial location, and invasion of vital structures (LSS only). Local failure varied significantly with histologic type and was highest in patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and angiosarcoma. When the data were subjected to multivariate analysis, the following variables emerged as independent predictors of local failure: presentation with local recurrence, surgery by LSS, inadequate margins, angiosarcoma, and invasion of vital structures. These risk factors should be carefully weighed when selecting local treatment for patients with upper extremity soft tissue sarcomas.\r"

MRI and CT had a similar percentage of accuracy in assessing tumor relationship with major neurovascular (80% and 70%, respectively) and skeletal (80% and 75%, respectively) structures. MRI was significantly better than CT in displaying contrast between tumor and muscle when using the T2 weighted spin echo (SE) (p2 less than 0.002) and inversion recovery (IR) (p2 less than 0.005) pulse sequences. MRI and CT were comparable in demonstrating contrast between tumor and fat. The contrast between tumor and vessel was better displayed by MRI compared with CT when using the T1 weighted SE (p2 less than 0.001) and T2 weighted SE (p2 less than 0.001) pulse sequences. T1 and T2 values were measured on fresh tumor and normal tissue samples and were used to predict relative contrast on different MRI pulse sequences using isosignal contour plots. MRI appears to offer several advantages over CT in the evaluation of extremity soft tissue tumors.\r"

  ".W": "A nationwide survey of the clinical presentation, pathology, and management of soft tissue sarcomas in adults was carried out under the auspices of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. Two separate 2-year periods were used to allow assessment of changes in patterns of care. Data were obtained from 504 hospitals in 1977-1978 (2355 patients) and 645 institutions in 1983-1984 (3457 patients). Pretreatment findings of interest included some evidence of physician delay in diagnosis, overuse of excisional biopsy as opposed to the generally preferred approach of incisional biopsy, a low rate of usage of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging (AJCSS) system, and major reliance on CT for pretreatment patient evaluation. Operation was the primary treatment, with or without adjuvant therapies, in approximately three fourths of the patients. The other one fourth were primarily patients with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Some increase in multimodal therapy did occur in the second period but the rate of amputation was low (approximately 10%) in both periods studied. Survival curves support the prognostic validity of the AJCCS system and the value of complete resection of soft tissue sarcomas. Adverse prognostic factors included positive surgical margins, large tumors, retroperitoneal or mediastinal primary sites, some histologic types, and the perceived need for adjuvant therapy. Patients receiving adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy had less favorable survival data than those treated by operation alone due to criteria used for selecting patients for these therapies. Approximately one half of the treatment failures in the 1977-1978 series were locoregional, whereas 18% were limited to lung metastasis. Salvage therapy for these two forms of treatment failure yielded 61% and 21% 5-year survival rates.\r"

All patients died within 1 year of the diagnosis of malignancy. Of 19 benign cysts available for pathologic examination, one third had proliferative epithelial changes, and in two of these patients a metachronous carcinoma developed. Goblet cell metaplasia was prominent in four patients. This suggests the possibility that dysplastic changes and metaplasia of the epithelium could give rise to carcinoma. Resection of benign cysts of the bile ducts is favored, when feasible, in an attempt to decrease the incidence of malignancy.\r"

Despite a 17% incidence of nondilated ductal systems, drainage was established in all patients using a 22-gauge \"skinny\" needle and \"accordion\" catheter. No attempt was made at definitive cholangiogram; only 1-2 mL of contrast were injected to confirm placement of the catheter. Sepsis began to resolve in all patients within 24 hours of PTD, after which definitive cholangiogram was performed. PTD was accompanied by a 7% (3/42) complication rate, none of which contributed to subsequent morbidity and mortality. Two patients in severe septic shock had PTD but died within 8 hours of admission, constituting a 5% mortality rate. Definitive therapy after resolution of sepsis included: surgical (16 patients), internal/external drainage (14 patients), balloon dilatation (10 patients), mono-octanoin infusion (1 patient), and ampullary dilatation (1 patient). The surgical morbidity rate was 18%. There was no mortality. PTD is effective in providing decompression as initial therapy for acute cholangitis with minimal morbidity. Accurate diagnosis provided by the definitive cholangiogram obviates the need for multiple surgical procedures. PTD provides a portal to the biliary tract for alternative procedures (i.e., internal/external drainage, balloon dilatation), especially in patients with medical contraindications to surgery.\r"

Five of the eight tumors proved to be malignant. Five were drained by anastomosis to a viscus and one by aspiration; drainage was recommended for the other two. Treatment by drainage led to complications (persistent painful gastric ulcer, infection in the cysts), growth of new cysts, no cures, but missed opportunities to cure cancer. Three patients with no metastases at first operation had metastatic spread to the liver, omentum, or lungs at reoperation. In three of the five cases initially treated by cystenterostomy (including one cancer), subsequent resection was possible and probably curative. One cystadenocarcinoma was watched for 3 years before apparently curative resection. Guidelines based on serum and cyst amylase levels, morphologic appearance, angiography, pancreatography, and biopsy are given for the purpose of differentiating inflammatory cysts from neoplastic cysts of the pancreas. Confusion of these entities should not occur, but errors can often be corrected.\r"

There was a highly significant decrease (p less than 0.001) in flow at the ulcerated areas 30 minutes after exposure to aspirin, coinciding with the appearance of focal mucosal pallor followed by subsequent hemorrhagic foci and ulceration. This was not followed by recovery to basal flow values. Blood flow to the non-ulcerated areas was significantly but less severely reduced than in the ulcerated areas (p less than 0.05) 90 minutes after exposure to aspirin. This was followed by recovery to basal levels.

  ".W": "The nonrecirculating isolated perfused rat liver was used to study biliary antibiotic excretion by the liver in a steady-state, controlled environment in which bile flow, bile salt output, and antibiotic delivery were maintained under constant conditions. The effects of piperacillin, ampicillin, and gentamicin on bile flow and bile salt output were analyzed; none altered bile salt output, and only high concentrations of piperacillin (100 micrograms/mL) increased bile flow. The ratio of antibiotic concentration in bile and perfusate depended on the type of antibiotic and perfusate concentration. Piperacillin infusions at perfusate concentrations of 50 or 100 micrograms/mL (in the presence of 60 microM taurocholate) yielded bile to perfusate ratios of 112 +/- 10 versus 49 +/- 3, respectively. Using similar perfusate, the concentration ratios for ampicillin (20 micrograms/mL) and gentamicin (10 micrograms/mL) were only 3.4 +/- 0.5 and 0.5 +/- 0.1, respectively. By altering the perfusate to contain either 60 microM or 240 microM taurocholate, we found variance in bile salt output from 27 +/- 1 to 115 +/- 2 mumol/h, yet this alteration had little effect on the output of ampicillin (perfusate concentration of 20 micrograms/mL), 73 +/- 7 versus 74 +/- 12 micrograms/h, or piperacillin (perfusate concentration 100 micrograms/mL), 10 +/- 1 versus 11 +/- 2 mg/h. Thus, it appears ampicillin and piperacillin are excreted into bile at high concentrations by bile salt-independent pathways. Partial biliary obstruction (6 cm H2O) results in significant decreases in bile volume. Infusion of 50 micrograms/mL of piperacillin resulted in increased biliary flow that approached nonobstructed values. Obstruction resulted in significant decreases in bile piperacillin concentration. Whether the choleretic effect of high concentrations of piperacillin has any clinical significance in nonobstructed or obstructed conditions remains to be established.\r"

Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified tricuspid regurgitation (p less than .03, improvement-of-fit chi square) and the aortic valve lesion (p less than .03) as the independent predictors of postoperative complications (mortality or low-output syndrome). Patients with tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular decompensation and those with aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy had limited ventricular functional reserve and faced an increased risk.

A wide thoracoplasty and ample decapitation of the empyema cavity allow sufficient room for a modified pectoralis muscle flap, which provides sufficient mass to obliterate the entire empyema cavity. We present the cases of 2 patients in whom an esophagopleural fistula occurring 3 and 16 years after pneumonectomy was successfully closed by this method.\r"

  ".U": "87183731\r", 
  ".W": "From 1974 through 1983, 689 hospital survivors of Starr-Edwards (SE) valve replacement were identified; 279 (40.4%) patients with complete follow-up had an isolated mitral valve (SE model 6120 or 6400) replacement: 60.6% of these patients were women, 33.4% were in sinus rhythm, 32.3% had predominantly mitral stenosis, and 23.6% had predominantly regurgitation. Forty-six (6.7%) patients had mitral and aortic valve (SE model 1260 or 2400) replacement, 60.9% were women, and 13% were in sinus rhythm. To determine the long-term outcome of these SE valve prostheses, 325 (97.8%) patients were observed for up to 10 years. Total 10-year mortality was 40 patients (2.54% patients/yr) in the mitral group, of which 26 deaths (9.3%) were cardiac in origin; 8 deaths (2.8%) were directly valve related. Eight patients died (3.47% patients/yr) in the double-valve group, of which 5 deaths (10.8%) had a cardiac cause; 2 deaths (4.3%) were directly valve related. Primary valve failure was never proved. Actuarial estimates of survival at 10 years were 82 +/- 2.6% for the mitral valve group and 81 +/- 6% for the double-valve group. Actuarial estimates of freedom from valve-related morbidity were 87 +/- 2% for the mitral valve group and 59 +/- 7% for the double-valve group. Actuarial estimates of freedom from thromboembolism were 93 +/- 2% for the mitral valve group and 70 +/- 7% for the double-valve group. This prosthesis-based assessment has shown satisfactory long-term performance characteristics of the SE mitral models 6120 and 6400 without any recorded episodes of mechanical valve dysfunctions.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that low-amplitude electrical activity (LEA) may occur during standard hyperkalemic hypothermic cardioplegic arrest and be undetected by routine monitoring techniques. The present study was designed to elucidate the electrophysiological nature of LEA. Ten dogs were monitored continuously during standard cardioplegic arrest using a 32-channel data acquisition system. In 7 animals (Part I), electrophysiological mapping of the lower right atrial septum during arrest was performed. The initial site of activation of LEA was consistently recorded from the region of the lower atrial septum prior to atrial or ventricular electrical activation. The site of origin of LEA was thus localized to the anatomical region of the atrial septum containing the atrioventricular nodal conduction tissue. In Part II, the electrophysiological mechanism of LEA was investigated in the remaining 3 animals utilizing an intrinsic property of specialized conduction tissue. Inclusion of a calcium channel-blocking agent in standard cardioplegic solution completely prevented the development of LEA in all 3 animals, which is in contrast to findings in previous studies using standard cardioplegic solution alone. These data suggest that LEA may be related to calcium-mediated activation of specialized conduction tissue. This mechanism of activation may explain why LEA cannot be detected by the intraoperative monitoring techniques routinely employed.\r"

Right anterolateral thoracotomy has been recommended as an alternative for patients undergoing mitral valve replacement, but data supporting one approach over the other do not exist. To compare these procedures, the records of 43 patients who had had a previous median sternotomy and who underwent mitral valve replacement were reviewed. No statistically significant differences between patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy (33 patients) and those undergoing right anterolateral thoracotomy (10 patients) were demonstrable when compared for age, gender, New York Heart Association Functional Class, other diseased valves, urgency of operation, indication for operation, type of valve removed, type of valve implanted, length of postoperative hospitalization, length of operation, days of ventilatory support, length of intensive care unit stay, and survival (90% for thoracotomy group; 76% for median sternotomy group; p, NS). Significant differences between the two groups, favoring right anterolateral thoracotomy, were apparent when comparisons were made for length of perfusion (means, 94.8 min, thoracotomy group; 121.4 min, sternotomy group; p = .03), incidence of reexploration (0%, thoracotomy group; 13%, sternotomy group; p = .001), and blood transfusion (means, 5.3 units, thoracotomy group; 11.4 units, sternotomy group; p = .003). Right anterolateral thoracotomy is an effective alternative to repeat median sternotomy for replacement of the mitral valve in patients who have had a previous median sternotomy.\r"

Two other patients received glutaraldehyde-preserved, ethanol-fixed bovine bioprosthetic pericardial substitutes. One patient had minimal prosthesis-to-epicardium adhesions, and the remaining patient demonstrated moderate prosthesis-to-epicardium adhesions with giant-cell and lymphocyte fibrosis. In all patients prosthesis-to-sternum adhesions were minimal. These observations suggest that careful washing is essential in all bioprosthetic implants to eliminate residual preservatives and fixatives. In addition, preservation in ethanol is associated with less prosthesis-epicardium reaction than is formalin preservation. Both products are successful in easing reentry, and no episode of infection has been associated with either prosthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic flow rates (Q) during nonpulsatile hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) that are consistent with preservation of cerebral function have not to our knowledge been objectively defined. The effect of a sequential reduction in flow rates on cerebral cortical metabolism and function was evaluated in 6 mongrel dogs during hypothermic (25 degrees C) CPB. Cerebral function was assessed using somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (SSEP); cerebral metabolism was assessed by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and lactate content of snap-frozen gray matter biopsies taken from the hemisphere contralateral to that monitored for SSEP. A progressive decline in ATP levels was observed during flow reduction with virtually complete depletion of ATP at 0.25 L min-1 m-2(p = .0003). The significant (p = .028) dependence of cortical ATP levels on perfusion pressure was no longer evident after adjusting for the effects of flow rate. Lactate levels increased during flow reduction (p = .028), especially at flow rates less than 0.5 L min-1 m-2. Somatosensory neural transmission remained intact until flow was reduced to 0.25 L min-1 m-2 in 5 animals and until total circulatory arrest in 1, at which time loss of the signal occurred. In addition, 5 patients were subjected to brief periods of low-flow CPB (Q = 1.0 L min-1 m-2) at 21 degrees to 25 degrees C. SSEPs remained intact during flow reduction, and postoperative neurologic evaluation was normal in all patients. We conclude that, in the absence of cerebral vascular disease, the flow rate threshold for incurring functional cerebral injury during hypothermic (25 degrees C) nonpulsatile CPB is less than 1.0 L min-1 m-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of a small volume of red cells to a crystalloid perfusate improves capillary perfusion. Based on these results, we have changed our cardioplegic solution from cold crystalloid to cold oxygenated dilute blood. In the present study we retrospectively evaluate the results of 400 operative procedures to determine whether the addition of oxygenation and a small volume of blood to the cardioplegic solution enhances myocardial protection in the clinical setting. Two hundred consecutive patients who underwent operation with cardioplegic arrest using a cold crystalloid cardioplegic solution (group 1) were compared with a subsequent 200 patients who underwent operation with cold oxygenated dilute blood cardioplegia (group 2). Patients in group 2, who received cold oxygenated dilute blood cardioplegia, had a significantly reduced need for postoperative intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation and for atrioventricular pacing. Also, patients in group 2 had a lower incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and had improved early outcome. None of the 200 patients in group 2 had electrocardiographic evidence of perioperative infarction. We conclude that cold oxygenated dilute blood cardioplegia provides better preservation than does a nonoxygenated crystalloid solution during elective ischemic arrest, because a cold crystalloid solution is able to deliver oxygen and the red cells are able to enhance capillary perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Multidose potassium cardioplegia is a common method of myocardial preservation. Although initial potassium arrest conserves high-energy phosphates, there is conflicting evidence that repeat high potassium boluses augment this protection. Fifty-six patients were prospectively randomized to receive multidose cold high potassium cardioplegia (27 mEq of KCl/L) both in the initial and subsequent infusions (Group 1) or an initial cold high potassium (27 mEq/L) cardioplegia followed by boluses of cold low potassium (7 mEq, of KCl/L) solution (Group 2). The two groups were compared in terms of postoperative myocardial electrical stability and hemodynamic performance. Electrocardiograms were recorded by continuous Holter monitor, and the data were analyzed by computer. The duration of aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass did not differ between groups. Group 1, who received more total KCl than Group 2 (p less than .005), experienced more high-grade ventricular ectopia during both reperfusion (p less than .001) and the immediate postoperative period (p less than .001), and required more lidocaine hydrochloride (p less than .001) for arrhythmias. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic performance between the two groups. This study fails to show an advantage to multidose \"high potassium\" cardioplegia and found a significant increase in ventricular ectopia associated with its use. We advocate using low potassium solutions after initial cold high potassium arrest.\r"

Accumulation of these elements was correlated with alterations in postischemic isovolumic contractile function. There were increases in calcium of 207%, 390%, and 681% of the non-ischemic control following reperfusion after respective ischemic intervals of 30, 35, and 40 minutes. These corresponded to decrements in peak developed pressure of 23.8% after 30 minutes, 68.6% after 35 minutes, and no recovery of function after 40 minutes of ischemia. Thirty-five and 40 minutes of ischemia produced 138% and 170% increases in intracellular sodium, respectively. These data show that there is a graded accumulation of intracellular sodium and calcium that correlates with the duration of ischemia and the degree of functional impairment in the postischemic heart. Measurement of intracellular sodium and calcium may, therefore, serve as an adjunct to other biochemical and functional factors used to quantitate postischemic and postcardioplegic damage in the development of new myoprotective regimens.\r"

In the present series, we report our experience over a 20-year period (1965 through 1984) with an alternative method, colon interposition. Two hundred forty-eight patients (124 men and 124 women) underwent colon interposition. Seventy-one percent (175) of the tumors were squamous cell carcinomas, and 23% (58) were adenocarcinomas in the gastric cardia and lower esophagus. The left colon was the substitute of first choice and was used in 54% of the patients. Of the interpositions, 59% were antiperistaltic. Esophagectomy without thoracotomy was the method in 146 patients. The operative mortality was 16% (40 patients), and 3% (8 patients) sustained colon graft necrosis. Leakage in the upper anastomosis occurred in 4% (10). No dysphagia was experienced by 85%, 80%, and 76% of the patients during reexaminations 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, after operation. The 1-year and 5-year survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma was 40% and 10%, respectively, and for patients with adenocarcinoma, 50% and 12%, respectively. The data from this study suggest that colon interposition offers a good alternative for long-term relief of dysphagia in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. The rate of complications is acceptable.\r"

Accordingly, articles from the American Journal of Psychiatry (N = 194) and the Archives (N = 109) were randomly sampled for the years 1953, 1963, 1973, and 1983. Two raters achieved reliability (kappa = .82) for recognizing the major types of study design (cohort, clinical trial, case control, cross sectional, case report, and review). There was a significant change in study architecture over time, with the percentage of review articles declining and the percentage of case-control and cross-sectional studies increasing. Another major finding was a large increase in use of inclusion and exclusion criteria for diagnosis in non-review article studies. The general trends are for increasingly sophisticated research designs to be used in psychiatry research. The quality of research designs in psychiatry for 1983 also compares favorably with research designs found in a respected medicine journal.\r"

When these data are combined with other reports, an ominous trend may be present, leading to an increase in prevalence of a broad spectrum of familial affective disorders in the coming decades.\r"

Fifteen patients (38%) were dexamethasone nonsuppressors; they had significantly higher predexamethasone serum and urine cortisol measures than both their matched controls and the 25 suppressor patients. Both the predexamethasone and postdexamethasone cortisol measures were unimodally distributed across the patients and the controls. Circadian cortisol rhythms of similar magnitude occurred in both groups. The cortisol measures before and after dexamethasone administration were positively correlated to a similar degree in the patients and their controls, suggesting that predexamethasone hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical hyperactivity and postdexamethasone cortisol nonsuppression are not independently determined in endogenous depression.\r"

Patients may differ from controls in the metabolism and/or disposition of CAs. We analyzed the suggested metabolic-dispositional differences by determining 24-hour urine values for norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), normetanephrine (NM), metanephrine (M), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). For each subject, we calculated ratios of CAs or metabolites to an estimate of CA synthesis and determined ratios of CAs and metabolites to each other based on a precursor-product paradigm. The results indicate that as a group, patients have modestly but significantly greater CA synthesis rates than controls; patients excrete disproportionately more NE and E and disproportionately less MHPG relative to estimated CA synthesis, as well as other metabolites, than do controls; in contrast to NE, E, and MHPG, the increased NM, M, and VMA excretion rates by patients are proportional to each other as well as to the increase in CA synthesis; and the differences in NE, E, and metabolite excretion in the patients as a group are due principally to unipolar rather than bipolar depressives. The differences would be expected if patients, relative to controls, released more NE and E into the circulation. These data indicate the need to measure several CAs and metabolites when evaluating differences between groups since the significance of any given metabolite value needs to be examined in the context of total CA and metabolite production and excretion.\r"

Heart rate, blood pressure, and plasma free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin levels were measured before, during, and after exposure. Fifteen patients experienced situational panic attacks during exposure. Panicking patients displayed significantly greater increases in heart rate but not blood pressure or plasma free MHPG or cortisol in comparison with the healthy subjects. Growth hormone and prolactin responses tended to be smaller in the patients. If brain noradrenergic hyperactivity occurs during situational panic attacks, it may be too brief or too restricted in regional localization to affect MHPG levels in plasma. Chronically recurrent attacks may cause an adaptation of neuroendocrine mechanisms activated by anxiety or stress.\r"

Sixteen patients (11.3%) had systemic calcareous embolization. Eight patients showed clinical symptoms reflecting embolization, while the others did not. Three of the patients with clinical manifestations had been admitted to the hospital with a history of a fall and two of these, whose postmortem examination included the brain, showed focal meningitis due to embolization from an infected calcified mitral annulus fibrosus. Another three patients had been admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis of cerebral vascular accident and were found to have focal ischemic necrosis or large cerebral infarcts. These were the result of either calcareous or bland embolization from a thrombus superimposed on an ulcerated calcified annulus. Eight of the 16 patients with calcareous embolization also had had sepsis, six attributable to infective endocarditis complicating the calcified mitral annulus fibrosus. This study suggests the relatively frequent occurrence of spontaneous calcareous embolization from an ulcerated calcified mitral annulus fibrosus in older adults.\r"

Electron microscopy showed that the aggregates formed in the absence of endothelial denudation or exposure of basal lamina. Initial lesions consisted only of endothelial lucencies, vacuoles, and distended rough or smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Aggregates consisted not only of degranulating platelets, rounded platelets, and platelets with pseudopods, but also of masses of discoid platelets. Red blood cells were uninjured and did not form the nidus of these collections. The possibility that aggregation occurred as a result of direct injury to the platelet, and independently of the endothelial damage, is discussed and considered unlikely. Rather, the data are consonant with the hypothesis that in the microcirculation, endothelial injury can produce aggregation prior to exposure of basal lamina.\r"

No histologic differences were observed between JCF occurring as solitary or multiple tumors or between lesions occurring in patients younger and older than age 20 years. The JCF was shown to be a fairly distinct clinicopathologic entity that characteristically occurred in adolescents, but which was occasionally seen in young adults.

In all four cases, the lesions were remarkably uniform in microscopic appearance, consisting of monotonous sheets of gemistocytic astroglia interspersed by numerous foamy macrophages. In sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, the most helpful diagnostic features were the even distribution of the foamy macrophages and the absence of associated necrosis. In each case, the diagnosis was confirmed with special stains that disclosed total destruction of myelin sheaths with relative preservation of axons. Significant inflammatory infiltration was present in only one of five biopsy specimens.\r"

For some faculty members, major career changes can result when major curricular innovation occurs in a department. The department planning curricular change should have a comprehensive faculty development program ready to deal in a fair and effective way with both the curricular and the personal issues that arise. The faculty should, first, be brought into active participation early in the development of the new curriculum. Next, the faculty should be trained in teaching methods required by the new curriculum. Finally, counseling and even alternative career choices should be made available for any faculty members who are doubtful about their roles in the new curriculum. Departments lacking such a program may experience problems that interfere with well-intended improvements in the curriculum. The faculty development program described here contributed to our faculty's enthusiastic adoption of an innovative pathology curriculum.\r"

Most subjects were highly educated, earned good incomes, and could be characterized as having adequate resources to achieve a good standard of living. Activity Pattern Indicators reveal that this high-resource SCI group allocated time in a pattern very similar to that of the high-resource, nondisabled group. Significantly less time was spent in active recreation and household tasks. Although the overall time allocation pattern was similar, the groups differed in the tempo of activity entry. The average member of the SCI group switched from one activity to another 20% less often. The findings are discussed in terms of the need for further research and the implications of these findings and of the general approach for a public policy regarding reducing external handicapping conditions. The conclusion is reached that adequate access to resources decreases the impact of impairment in SCI.\r"

All five children exhibited an indwelling thumb at rest and during reaching and grasping activities, using a \"raking,\" ulnar type of prehension pattern. In all five children the orthosis was effective in changing the position of the thumb and improving the prehension pattern to a radial grasp in which objects were held between the thumb and the fingers, usually in a three-jaw chuck or large cylindrical prehension pattern, depending on the size of the object being manipulated. Possible explanations for the improved hand function include placement of the thumb in a more functional position, inhibition of muscle tone in thumb adductors and flexors, and the opportunity for increased sensory input and successful practice using the hand.\r"

Ulcerations in the first group were located on the metatarsal heads and toes, while ulcerations in the second group were located on the dorsum of the foot, heel, plantar arch, ankle, medial aspect of foot, and toe or transmetatarsal amputation sites. Successfully healed diabetic neuropathic foot ulcerations treated with total contact casting were rated according to patient age, ethnic origin, sex, patient weight, ulcer size, ulcer location, duration of ulcer prior to casting, and ulcer grade. Analysis of variance and posthoc analyses demonstrated that (1) total contact casting was a highly effective method of treatment regardless of ulcer location (forefoot ulcer healing time mean = 30.6 days; nonforefoot ulcer healing time mean = 42.1 days) and (2) forefoot ulcerations healed significantly faster than ulcerations located on other parts of the foot. Complex correlational relationships were explored in this study, and multiple regression equations were developed for each location grouping.\r"

In 85 cases this was supplemented by questionnaires and recent photographs, permitting a two- to 13-year follow-up. The first visit for 81.6% of patients was before six months of age. All were enrolled in a specific physical therapy program at the time of the first visit, unless they presented with severe torticollis after 12 months of age. Torticollis was mild to moderately severe in 90.6% of cases. Sternomastoid fibrotic nodules were present in 38.6%, more frequently in the more severe cases. Hip dysplasia increased in direct relation to severity and occurred in 10.5% of cases. At 12 months the torticollis had been conservatively resolved in nearly 70% of patients regardless of severity and presence or absence of focal fibrosis. Tenotomies were indicated in only ten children, eight of whom had first been seen after 12 months of age. Long-term sequelae were mild and consisted of craniofacial asymmetry, intermittent head tilt, and mild scoliosis. Developmental asymmetry or high tone due to limited mobility in the cervical spine were noted in 25.3% of infants initially and tended to subside with appropriate therapy. However, 11.8% of patients with long-term follow-up showed persistent functional asymmetry of the involved body side despite mild or moderate severity, early diagnosis, and complete resolution of the torticollis. Long-term observations indicate that congenital torticollis rarely requires surgical treatment.\r"

Through the comprehensive rehabilitation program these two patients were able to make gains, especially in some activities of daily living and in lower extremity functions. Since some of the upper extremity activities, such as dressing or bathing, could not be accomplished, it appears that patients with upper extremity amputation who have a contralateral hemiplegia have a poorer prognosis for achieving functional independence than patients with lower extremity amputation and similar neurologic loss.\r"

After several unsuccessful attempts at using a variety of augmentative communication devices, manual signing was attempted. Several signs believed to be useful for communicating the patient's needs and wants were selected. The signs were introduced in a three-stage training procedure: imitation of a sign model, pointing to a picture of the concept signed, and producing the sign when presented with the pictured concept. A sign item was considered to be acquired when the patient had progressed through all three of the training stages. The patient acquired 47 signs over a five-month period, but was unable to use these signs in spontaneous, self-initiated communication. These findings illustrate the vast gap that exists between learning to produce a sign in response to a stimulus and using those signs for functional communication. The distinction between sign acquisition and sign use has largely been ignored in previous investigations of sign training with aphasic patients. Programming for generalization of acquired signs is a logical next step for future research on this topic.\r"

Low-frequency changes in tissue impedance across the neck were recorded with an EGG during deglutition. On six nonimpaired subjects, EGG waveforms were consistently monophasic and appeared to be well timed with laryngeal height changes. The waveforms of the two dysphagic subjects differed markedly from those of the nonimpaired subjects, and their timing and shapes were consistent with videofluoroscopic descriptions of those of the dysphagic subjects. The two parkinsonian patients also showed aberrant waveform patterns. These observations suggest that use of the EGG has strong potential as a quantitative technique for swallowing evaluation, therapy, and research.\r"

This program especially emphasized shoulder abduction exercises. The pain intensified as he continued and finally he noted weakness of the involved shoulder, which led him to seek medical advice. Examination was normal except for atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle on the involved side and decreased strength of shoulder abduction and external rotation. Electromyographic examination demonstrated 3+ positive sharp waves in the infraspinatus muscle, delayed conduction to the supraspinatus muscle, and absence of an evoked response to the infraspinatus muscle. Surgical decompression of the suprascapular nerve within the suprascapular notch was then performed. Two weeks after surgery the pain was much less and the conduction velocities had improved. Eight months after surgery the patient was free of pain, the conduction velocities had returned to normal, and electromyography revealed reinnervation of the denervated muscle fibers. Intensive shoulder exercise, especially involving repeated forceful abduction movements, should be considered in the etiology of suprascapular neuropathy.\r"

However, this deficit is more common when associated with other behavioral disturbances that result from trauma or cerebral infarction to the posterior cerebral hemispheres. Two cases presented with alexia without agraphia following infarction within the posterior cerebral artery territory. Because of initial confusion and disorientation the patients were diagnosed as demented and unsuitable for rehabilitation. Both subjects had a visual field deficit and color agnosia. Prosopagnosia, simultanagnosia, and ataxia of visual-motor control were also present. The second case was unusual because of pure word blindness associated with a right occipital lobe lesion. Only a few such cases have been reported in the literature worldwide. This paper demonstrates that careful delineation of cognitive deficits permits greater understanding of functional disorders with improved rehabilitation outcome.\r"

Three middle-aged to elderly unilateral amputees performed progressive discontinuous bilateral arm crank and combined bilateral arm-single leg cycle exercise tests on the same air-braked ergometer adapted for either form of ergometry. Select amputees may achieve greater peak oxygen uptakes (VO2), power outputs (PO), and heart rates (HR) during combined bilateral arm-single leg cycle testing versus bilateral arm crank testing. Following 14 weeks of combined arm-leg training on the modified ergometer, a 73-year-old above-knee amputee demonstrated peak VO2 and PO increases of 25% (+3.8 mL X kg-1 X min-1) and 33% (+25W) respectively. Combined arm-leg ergometry as described herein may activate the largest available muscle mass and elicit the greatest oxygen uptake during exercise testing. In addition this exercise modality may simultaneously condition the arms and leg, providing functional gains in both wheelchair propulsion and prosthetic ambulation.\r"

The splenic vein was also occluded in eight of the 13 patients who had angiograms. The liver was normal in all 14 cases. The clinical importance of SMV-PV occlusion in chronic pancreatitis lies in (1) its presentation by variceal bleeding, (2) the probable necessity for nonshunting means of control for bleeding varices, (3) the increased difficulty of operations on the pancreas because of portal hypertension, and (4) the possible confusion with pancreatic cancer.\r"

Transperitoneal drainage was not used. Skin and subcutaneous tissues were left open for delayed primary wound closure. Perforations with well-developed abscesses were treated with triple antibiotic therapy and interval appendectomy. The only infectious complication was one intra-abdominal abscess. There were no wound infections or deaths. The rate of infectious complications was 0.9%, and the overall morbidity was 4.4%.

The AHVECs attached less well to Mylar and Teflon (39% and 21%), and in no case were AHVECs observed to grow or migrate on either of these polymers. This finding correlates with the clinical observation that VPs fabricated from Mylar and Teflon uniformly fail to develop an endothelial cell lining after implantation in vivo. Future VPs, fabricated from materials chosen for their ability to support AHVEC attachment, growth, and migration in vitro, might better support a spontaneous endothelial cell lining after implantation in humans.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of the clinical course surrounding internal carotid artery occlusion (ICO) was undertaken in 97 patients with 106 instances of ICO. No neurologic symptoms could be attributed to more than half of the ICOs. Of the 52 symptomatic occlusions, 19 (37%) were associated with transient ischemic attacks and 33 (63%) with fixed strokes. Only 10% of all patients had permanent disabling neurologic sequelae. There was no correlation between development of neurologic symptoms and the side of the ICO, the presence or severity of contralateral carotid artery disease, or other risk factors. Women, however, were twice as likely as men to develop a fixed stroke with ICO. Seventy-six of these patients underwent reconstructive carotid surgery. Although there was a high rate of abnormal intraoperative findings with electroencephalographic monitoring (32 of 62 cases), with the use of intraoperative shunts there was no increase in the postoperative stroke complication rate (1.8%). These data suggest that the concern that ICO leads to serious fixed neurologic deficits may be overestimated, and that its presence does not adversely affect carefully performed contralateral carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Cystadenoma (15 patients) was more common than cystadenocarcinoma (11 patients). Preoperative symptoms, such as abdominal pain, were present for as long as 18 years before diagnosis. The mean size of cysts was 7 cm. Distal pancreatectomy, the most common operation, was performed in ten patients. Eight of the 11 patients with cystadenocarcinoma had metastatic disease at the time of surgical exploration. There was one postoperative death (3.8%). Patients with cystadenocarcinoma had an adjusted median survival time after operation of 6.0 months. The long prodrome in many of the cancer patients suggests that benign cystadenomas, particularly of the mucinous type, may undergo malignant degeneration. Benign cystadenoma seems unlikely to recur after adequate resection. Whenever possible, complete excision of cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma is the procedure of choice.\r"

We compared the mechanism of action of omeprazole and somatostatin-14, both inhibitors of gastric acid, with that of tetraprenylacetone, a drug thought to be cytoprotective in the upper gut. Omeprazole and somatostatin-14 caused potent inhibition of meal-stimulated acid secretion in the dog (92% +/- 6% and 97% +/- 1%, respectively). On the other hand, tetraprenylacetone had no significant inhibitory effect on acid secretion (4% +/- 17%). In separate studies, tetraprenylacetone was shown to be a stimulant of gastric bicarbonate secretion in the rabbit, increasing bicarbonate secretion from a basal level of 0 to 86 +/- 28 pmol/2 h. Tetraprenylactone was also found to be a strong stimulant of canine pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. The ability of tetraprenylacetone to stimulate endogenous bicarbonate secretion may explain its ability to heal ulcers both experimentally and clinically.\r"

The only meaningful therapy for these patients is a potentially curative re-resection. The records and operative reports of 29 patients with regional pelvic tumor recurrence treated between 1981 and 1986 were reviewed. The operative procedures performed included three bowel resections, six abdominoperineal resections, eight pelvic exenterations, eight resections of tumor recurrence, and four conservative procedures. There was one operative death in this group. Significant morbidity was noted in the group but was clustered in a small number of patients operated on early in the series. The median follow-up in this series was 13 months (range, two to 51 months). Nineteen (65%) of the patients are surviving at a median follow-up of ten months (range, two to 51 months). The median survival (following resection) in the ten patients (35%) who died was 18 months. In 15 (52%) of the patients, a complete resection was performed. In this group, the survival is 80% with a median follow-up of 11 months. Seven (37%) are surviving with no evidence of disease. Palliation of symptoms occurred in 23 (79%) of the 29 patients. Radical resection of tumor recurrence in the pelvis can be performed with acceptable mortality and complication rates. This therapy should be considered for further clinical trials combining surgical and adjuvant therapy in patients with regional pelvic tumor recurrence.\r"

We report our experience with ten such cases in which difficult wounds were reconstructed immediately after major regional resections of advanced or recurrent tumors in fields of previous irradiation. All of these patients could undergo extirpation of their recurrent tumors in irradiated fields because of improved techniques in reconstructive flap surgery allowing large amounts of well-vascularized tissue to be transferred, sometimes over a significant distance. Follow-up of these patients has ranged from three to 18 months (median, nine months). Primary healing, decreased deformity, reduced morbidity, and prolonged disease-free intervals have been achieved with the combination of extirpative and reconstructive techniques.\r"

During the 20-year study, 43 (74%) of the 58 patients were cured. Though an initial 28% local failure rate was observed, 31% (5/16) of these patients were subsequently cured by a second electrocoagulation. Electrocoagulation has distinct advantages over conventional surgery and irradiation. Relatively little tissue beyond the tumor is coagulated. Such tissue sparing allows better postoperative function and cosmesis. The deleterious effects of irradiation, including the serious \"dry-mouth\" syndrome, are avoided. These treatment results are competitive with those of conventional surgery and irradiation. The limited field treated, the tissue conservation, the minimal morbidity, and the cost-effectiveness should make electrocoagulation a real consideration in treating selected invasive intraoral tumors. Ideally suited for electrocoagulation are those patients whose lesions are small, easily visualized, mobile, and well differentiated.\r"

Laser iridotomy, with or without medical treatment, obviated further surgical treatment in most categories of eyes. Visual acuity remained unchanged or improved in the great majority (92%) of cases over the period of follow-up (range, two to 12 months; median, four months). Visual deterioration in 8% of eyes was attributed to the usual causes, such as normal cataract progression, but none was believed to be related to the laser treatment.

This indicates the rarity of open angle glaucoma in Eskimo eyes and a reversal of the typical pattern found in the general US population. Narrow angle glaucoma occurred at a rate of 2.65% in Eskimos older than 40 years of age, the prevalence increasing with age in both sexes. Women were afflicted almost four times as often as men, and the sex difference persisted across all age groups. Anterior chamber angles appeared clinically narrower with age and among women. Seventeen percent of all Eskimos older than 50 years had occludable angles by gonioscopy. These findings target older Eskimo women as a group particularly at risk for angle closure glaucoma.\r"

Unfavorable prognostic factors included the following: contour of subretinal fluid (combined, ie, both anterior and posterior to the buckle); excessive amount of subretinal fluid; inadequate support of break(s); multiple drainages at first operation; rolled edge in association with a giant break; and residual vitreous traction on the break.

Preoperative factors associated with a favorable visual prognosis were a visual acuity of 5/200 or better, the absence of iris neovascularization, a clear crystalline lens or only minimal cataract formation, clear media or only mild vitreous hemorrhage, panretinal photocoagulation of at least one fourth of the retina, and the absence of severe preoperative retinal neovascularization. Intraoperative factors associated with a favorable visual prognosis include the avoidance of performing a lensectomy, the absence of iatrogenic retinal breaks, and the avoidance of using intraocular gas bubbles.\r"

Mean amplitude of accommodation in the diabetic population decreased with age and was less than that of a nondiabetic group and of previously published reports. Other factors associated with decreased accommodation in the diabetic population in a multiple linear regression analysis include sex, with the female population being more susceptible; absence of myopia; a longer duration of diabetes; higher glycosylated hemoglobin level; higher blood glucose level; increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy; and higher systolic blood pressure.\r"

Oscillatory potentials generated by either the rod or cone systems were markedly reduced. Absolute thresholds outside the fovea were either normal or only moderately elevated, indicating that the sensory neural pathways were, by and large, operating with limited dysfunction. Therefore, the oscillatory potentials do not directly reflect, to any appreciable extent, the function of bipolar or ganglion cells.

Patients with retinitis pigmentosa showed a significantly flat gradient compared with normal subjects, implying that fluorescein is distributed more rapidly in the vitreous body of the patients. It is suggested that patients with retinitis pigmentosa have an abnormal vitreous gel structure that causes more rapid distribution of fluorescein. If verified, this would indicate that vitreous fluorophotometry could be useful to evaluate changes in the integrity of the vitreous body in vivo.\r"

Histologic examination showed a band of dense fibrous tissue attached to the tarsal plates, with intermingled muscle fibers from the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle. A small pocket of fat was identified posterior to the orbital septum and anterior to the lateral canthal tendon. Clinical measurements of normal adults revealed 2 mm of lateral movement of the canthal angle during abduction, apparently caused by posterior fibrous attachments to the check ligament of the lateral rectus muscle.\r"

Although the role of secondary hydrocephalus cannot be discounted, we conclude that the direct effect of the hemorrhage on thalamic and mesencephalic structures is essential in the production of these oculomotor deficits. The prognosis for recovery of the upgaze palsy in these patients is good, although the time course may vary. However, the large-angle esotropia usually persists and requires surgical correction.\r"

The right eyes of ten adult pigmented rabbits underwent argon laser (five eyes) or Nd-YAG laser (five eyes) iridotomies. The left eyes served as controls and were not treated. The Scheimpflug camera (Zeiss) and fluorophotometry were used to quantitate lens clarity six weeks postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference in lens clarity between treatment groups when the experimental and control eyes were compared after six weeks. Thus, no diffuse lens opacification appeared evident after argon laser or Nd-YAG laser iridotomy.\r"

We found that silicone oils that have low-molecular-weight contents emulsify more readily than those that do not. Moreover, the extent and susceptibility to emulsification increases with decreasing viscosity or with an increase in the proportion of low-molecular-weight constituents. Hence, higher-molecular-weight (viscosity) oils or removal of low-molecular-weight components from medical grade fluid may lessen the emulsification observed clinically.\r"

Seven patients had neovascular glaucoma and 43 had refractory nonneovascular glaucoma, for which previous surgery was unsuccessful. A minimum follow-up of one year (mean, 18 months) was achieved for 30 eyes of 30 patients. For these eyes, the success rate (as defined by an intraocular pressure of 25 mm Hg or less, with or without medication) was 80%. Visual acuity was maintained or improved in 67% of eyes. The complications encountered in the overall study of 55 eyes are discussed, and six main causes of failure are identified. These include exposure of the silicone tube from erosion of the overlying conjunctiva; blockage of the proximal orifice of the tube; corneal decompensation secondary to tube touch; extrascleral tube compression proximal to the gutter; blockage of the distal orifice of the tube beneath the gutter; and insufficient aqueous absorption from the encapsulated area surrounding the 360 degrees encircling gutter. Revision surgery was required in 21 eyes (38%). Two alternative methods for insertion of the silicone tube (a \"cyclodialysis approach\" and a \"trabeculectomy approach\") are described, and their complications are compared. The incidences of tube exposure, choroidal detachment, and flat anterior chambers were far higher in the trabeculectomy group. The cyclodialysis group had an increased incidence of hyphema and corneal endothelial touch by the tube.\r"

The levator aponeurosis and Muller's muscle are recessed to avoid upper eyelid retraction. The key to performing this operation is a thorough knowledge of eyelid anatomy and techniques for preserving its microvascular blood supply. The bipedicle flap requires meticulous surgical technique but has many advantages over standard types of total lower eyelid reconstruction, including the following: excellent tissue match and cosmesis are obtained with single-stage reconstruction; distal flaps and grafts are avoided; open palpebral fissure is maintained, resulting in rapid rehabilitation; posterior lamella of tarsus, rather than substitute, is utilized; anterior lamella of functional orbicularis is utilized for support and closure; pedicles suspend and support the eyelid, decreasing lower eyelid retraction, laxity, and ectropion; allows simultaneous reconstruction of canthal defects; and is faster than other forms of total lower eyelid reconstruction. The results of 14 total lower eyelid reconstructions are presented. Minor canthal deformities, the most frequent complication, are easily corrected. This technique should be considered as an alternative to other procedures in cases of total lower eyelid reconstruction.\r"

Biopsy by lamellar keratectomy provides sufficient tissue for culture and for histopathologic evaluation by histochemistry, immunohistopathology, and, if necessary, electron microscopy. Consultation with an ophthalmic pathologist before biopsy can prevent inappropriate handling of the specimen, which may preclude essential diagnostic procedures. Many studies can be done within 24 hours of biopsy, often permitting rapid identification of the pathogen and prompt institution of appropriate therapy.\r"

Alterations of steroid metabolism in patients with SLE could be important in the pathogenesis of this disease, since it has been reported that gonadal steroids modulate the immune system. Moreover, research with inbred lupus mice has shown that estrogens have adverse effects on the disease in both sexes, whereas androgen therapy or oophorectomy is protective in females. Recently, the finding of elevated testosterone oxidation at C-17 in females with SLE suggested that plasma androgen levels in males and females with SLE should be examined more closely. We studied the varying degrees of clinical activity, with regard to plasma levels of 4 significant androgens: testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in a series of 5 male and 42 female SLE patients. Decreased levels of all androgens were observed in women with SLE. The lowest levels of plasma androgens were found in female patients who had active disease, as determined by laboratory and clinical assessment. These data support the fact that specific abnormalities of androgen metabolism in the female are associated with SLE, and may contribute in some way to morbidity and mortality. More importantly, these data may have implications for future therapeutic regimens based on male hormone replacement.\r"

The 2 groups were similar in their clinical and immunologic features, but differed in terms of airways function. Salivary, lacrimal, and sweat gland dysfunction were significantly more prevalent or severe in the group with airways disease. Antinuclear antibodies were also more prominent in the patients with airways disease, but antibodies against RNP, SS-A, SS-B, and double-stranded DNA were not present in these patients. HLA-DR4 was found in 80% of the RA patients with airways disease and in 57% of those without airways disease. HLA-B8 and DR3 were equivalently distributed in both groups. This prospective study further documents the existence of small airways disease in RA and supports the view that autoimmune exocrinopathy predisposes to its expression.\r"

  ".W": "The annual incidence of giant cell arteritis (the term used in this study to encompass the syndromes of temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, occurring either together or alone) was prospectively determined in a Danish county that had a population of approximately 200,000. In a single year, 46 new cases of giant cell arteritis were diagnosed, a number which corresponds to an incidence in the overall population of 21.5/10(5), and to an incidence of 76.6/10(5) for individuals age 50 years or older. These rates are higher than those previously reported in retrospective studies. The 3-year followup of all patients showed no onset of other diseases that would require a revision of the original diagnosis. There was no deviation from the age- and sex specific malignancy rate or the mortality rate in the overall population. Women had an incidence rate 4 to 5 times higher than that seen in men. Symptoms, for the most part, were the same as those found in other studies; however, vision loss was not observed during the followup period. Point prevalence at the start of the study was 37.8/10(5), which is below the rates previously reported. This is probably because of failure on the part of participating physicians to record all cases.\r"

  ".W": "Intraperitoneal injection of human fetal cartilage proteoglycan (depleted of chondroitin sulfate) in Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant induces a chronic erosive polyarthritis and spondylitis in all female BALB/c mice. This occurrence is strain-specific but not haplotype-specific, and it is sex-related. The development of the arthritis is associated with the natural presence of cellular immunity to the immunizing antigen and to chondroitinase ABC-treated mouse cartilage proteoglycan. In addition, relatively more antibody to the immunizing proteoglycan is elicited in arthritic mice, and antibodies are produced that cross-react with native mouse proteoglycan. This combination of immune responses is not observed in mice that do not develop arthritis. Associated with the arthritis is the development of cytotoxicity to mouse chondrocytes and, in some animals, of rheumatoid factor, immune deposits in joint tissues and kidneys, and the production of autoantibodies to mouse type II collagen. These observations might be related to our earlier demonstration that immunity to human cartilage proteoglycan is observed in some patients with ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

Fifty-three percent of dogs with joint disease showed significant levels of anti-type I collagen antibodies in their sera, and 56% had anti-type II reactivity. Ninety-one percent of the dogs with joint disease exhibited antibody reactivity to type I collagen in their synovial fluid, and 88% showed reactivity to type II collagen. Correlation of these results with the clinical data indicated that the antibodies had been elicited by antigens derived from cruciate ligaments (type I collagen) and from altered joint cartilage (type II collagen). Immunologic reactivity in this form of canine osteoarthritis is a new concept, and it should be considered in our attempts to understand the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

We report the results of treatment with high-dose, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone in 7 children with JDMS, 3 of whom had an excellent response with complete remission and no need for daily steroid therapy.

At diagnosis, treatment was initiated immediately with prednisone (80 mg/day) and plasmapheresis, which was performed as a first-aid measure. Improvement was noted as early as 10 days after the start of therapy. Within 5 1/2 months of the first symptoms of paralysis, the patient walked without difficulty and returned to her normal activities.

The presence of NPC EBV could induce EBV early antigen in all three lymphoblastoid cell lines. By autoradiography, we found that NPC EBV could induce cell fusion between Ad-AH cells and tritiated thymidine-labeled lymphoblastoid cells.

The most frequent finding was a trigeminal dysfunction of the paretic side, as shown by paresthesia and sensibility disturbance corresponding to the sensoritrigeminal area, as well as a dysfunction of the trigeminal component of the corneal reflex of the paretic side. Three patients showed migrating symptoms that were suggestive of a brain-stem disorder. In addition, four patients had an optic neuropathy, while an abnormal brain-stem audiometry response was demonstrated in five patients. The outcome of acute facial palsy one to two years after onset, however, could not be predicted from the clinical central nervous system signs. The degree of the palsy in the acute stage of the disease still seemed to be one of the most important prognostic factors. It is concluded that acute facial palsy is not a single entity, but rather a feature of different neurologic conditions.\r"

None are curative, and the results of the most widely used surgical procedure (resection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve) are not universally good, with a high recurrence rate in some series. Furthermore, the procedure is not reversible. Using a special electromyographic hypodermic needle, we injected botulinum A toxin into one of the vocal folds of two patients with severe spasmodic dysphonia. Both had significant improvement without any complications. Although the resultant paresis is not permanent, the injection can be repeated as needed as an outpatient procedure.\r"

Twenty-four healthy, postweanling mongrel puppies, aged 5 to 7 weeks, were randomly divided into two groups. The first group, consisting of 13 puppies, underwent cricotracheal resection with primary anastomosis. A second group, consisting of 11 puppies, served as controls and did not have surgery. Animals from both groups were killed at age 13 weeks. Most of the animals, however, were allowed to mature to adulthood and were killed between age 26 to 28 weeks. Comparative histologic examinations of the laryngotracheal complexes of operated-on and control dogs showed uninterrupted cartilage growth at the anastomosis site after cricotracheal resection. There was no significant difference in the mean area of the cricoid lumen between the two groups when luminal area was adjusted for body weight. The results demonstrate that cricotracheal resection in this animal model does not interrupt cricoid luminal area or cricoid cartilage growth, and provides rationale for further investigation of cricoid resection with primary anastomosis in humans. Cricotracheal resection in growing puppies appears to be an excellent model for further studies in the surgical treatment of acquired subglottic stenosis in infants and children.\r"

It offers the safety of a minimally rotated pedicle to reduce the chance of flap necrosis from kinking, and the convenience of a single-stage procedure. We have used this flap six times in our clinical experience. Typically, the defects were located in the anterior cervical region, and many of them were reconstructed following total laryngectomy and radical neck dissection. There was no incidence of flap necrosis in the patients, including those who had had preoperative irradiation.\r"

Morphologic evidence suggests that these layers participate in absorption and secretion of substances to and from the inner ear, such that the entire membrane could play a role in an inner ear \"defense system.\" A comparison of morphologic features of round-window membranes from cats, rodents, and human beings suggests that the cat is a superior animal model for experimental studies. Cationic ferritin, placed for two hours in the round-window niche of four normal cats, was observed to traverse the round-window membrane through pinocytotic vesicles into the connective tissue layer. Evidence of exocytosis of tracer by the inner epithelial layer into the scala tympani is presented. When placed in perilymph, this same tracer was incorporated by inner epithelial cells, suggesting absorptive capabilities of the round-window membrane.\r"

Twenty-five cats were evaluated electron microscopically as to the passage of a tracer, horseradish peroxidase, through normal RWMs and RWMs three days, one week, and two weeks following eustachian tube obstruction. Passage at three days following obstruction was similar to passage through the normal RWM. Following one to two weeks of obstruction, the permeability of the membrane was drastically reduced. The reduction in permeability was probably due to the presence of residual effusion overlying the membrane, the presence of granulation tissue within the niche, and a thickening of the RWM.\r"

Temporal bones were studied in chronological order in six age ranges to determine the possibility of age-related differences. No significant difference in the mean thickness of the round window membrane was observed in terms of age groups in normal temporal bones or temporal bones from patients with otitis media; however, a significant difference in the mean thickness was observed in the various forms of otitis media compared with the normal round window membrane in all age groups. The membrane was thickest in patients with chronic otitis media when compared with that in normal subjects or those with serous or purulent otitis media. The epithelial layer (including the subepithelial space) and the fibrous layer were measured individually to determine in which layer the change in mean thickness occurred. These measurements showed an involvement of all layers of the round window membrane in those groups with otitis media, with maximal involvement of the combined epithelial layer and subepithelial space.\r"

Light microscopic investigation of the ears of animals killed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery showed a bony union of the ossicle to its surrounding niche in 11 of 12 operated-on ears. Negligible inflammatory reaction was seen in areas of the middle ear not in contact with the adhesive. These observations suggest that 2-cyano-butyl-acrylate may be used to achieve a durable bony union in ossiculoplastic surgery with minimal side effects in the middle ear.\r"

The cochlear nuclei, the nerve root, and the other adjacent structures were studied in serial frontal and horizontal sections. Boundaries of these structures were digitized into a computer and eight three-dimensional models were produced. Two solid models (reconstructions) showed the spatial surface topography, while the others revealed the appearance of the nerve root within the nuclei. The reconstructions also showed the position of the tenia of the tela choroidea on the surface of the nuclei and its relation to the root. This knowledge makes it possible to use the tenia as a landmark for determination of the root position within the nuclei. As the nerve enters the nucleus and forms the root, there is an appreciable reduction in its thickness. At the same time, the distance between the nuclei surface and the root, which has a cone shape, increases. The cone is curved along its longitudinal axis toward the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The top of the root borders the dorsal cochlear nucleus. This study stems from work in this institution on placement of the central electroauditory prosthesis on the cochlear nuclei surface. The results obtained further knowledge of the anatomy of the nuclei, specifically the areas used for the prosthesis implantation and the underlying tissue.\r"

In selected patients these techniques reestablished a voluntary blink and provided corneal protection without the limitations of tarsorrhaphy.

Blood flow in the great cardiac vein was measured by a thermodilution technique, both at rest and during ischaemia induced by atrial pacing, before and after intravenous administration of gallopamil (0.02 mg/kg as a bolus dose given over three minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.0005 mg/kg/min). Gallopamil significantly prolonged the mean (SD) duration of pacing that was tolerated (11 (2.6) vs 14.8 (2.4] min, significantly increased the mean (SD) peak heart rate attained during pacing (142 (15) vs 158 (11) beats/min), and reduced mean (SD) arterial pressure (133 (17) vs 116 (17) mm Hg). There were no changes in mean (SD) blood flow in the great cardiac vein (134.1 (57) vs 112.9 (38) ml/min, mean (SD) anterior regional coronary resistance (1.18 (0.6) vs 1.15 (0.5) mm Hg/ml/min), and mean (SD) anterior regional myocardial oxygen consumption (16.6 (6) vs 13.7 (4) ml/min). These data confirm that gallopamil is an effective antianginal agent and suggest that a reduction of myocardial oxygen demand is the predominant mechanism by which the drug exerts its beneficial effects.\r"

There was no significant difference between men and women. On exercise, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased significantly to 57.4 (13.0)%. In 17 of 32 subjects there was a fall in left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 5%, and regional wall motion abnormalities developed in 12 subjects.

In this selected group of subjects with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries, exercise induced left ventricular dysfunction, as shown by a fall in ejection fraction or the development of regional abnormalities, is a common finding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To identify predictive factors for coronary artery disease in patients with stenosis of the aortic valve the clinical histories, haemodynamic measurements, biplane contrast left ventriculograms, and coronary angiograms of 83 consecutively catheterised patients with valvar aortic stenosis were examined retrospectively. The mean (SD) age was 66.4 (9.1) years and 78% were men. Fifty five patients had significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% diameter narrowing). Forty five (82%) of 55 patients with and 23 (82%) of 28 patients without coronary disease had angina. Heart failure occurred in a third of the patients; these patients were on average older, were more likely to be female, and had lower ejection fractions and cardiac outputs than patients in whom failure did not occur. Calculated valve area, transvalvar gradient, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure did not discriminate between patients with and without coronary disease. Syncope was less common than angina and heart failure and was associated with significantly lower valve areas and higher gradients than those found in patients without syncope. Left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities were equally common in the groups with and without angina and predicted coronary artery disease with 94% accuracy. The absence of regional wall motion abnormality was an insensitive marker of normal coronary arteries as 45% of such patients had coronary disease. Five of the 83 patients had significant coronary disease without angina or regional wall motion abnormality. In patients with aortic stenosis angina did not predict the presence of coronary artery disease; therefore, it is advisable to have the results of coronary angiography before aortic valve replacement in a population such as this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the normal subjects the ejection fraction values calculated by each method were significantly different (mean SD) difference between semiautomatic and manual 3.3 (5.8); between semiautomatic and regional 12.0 (6.3); and between manual and regional 8.7 (6.9]. In the patients with heart failure the ejection fraction values calculated by the semiautomatic method differed significantly from those calculated by the manual and regional methods (mean (SD) difference between semiautomatic and manual 3.4 (4.7); between semiautomatic and regional 4.9 (4.9); and between manual and regional 1.5 (6.2]. The ejection fraction values obtained by the semiautomatic method were generally higher and more consistent than those derived from the manual and regional methods. An ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 50% with the semiautomatic method would be regarded as normal but if the same normal range was applied to the regional method nine (38%) of the 24 normal subjects would appear to have an abnormal left ventricular function. Clinicians should be aware that the method used to generate a time-activity curve is an important consideration in the calculation of ejection fraction. Each centre should establish its own range and reproducibility for the method it uses to measure ejection fraction. These values should not be assumed to apply to any other method.\r"

Forty four other cases of cardiac myxomas (five from the Mayo Clinic) presented with a combination of distinctive clinical features and these cases are described as \"syndrome myxoma\". The patients with syndrome myxoma were younger (mean age, 25 vs 56 years) and had unusual skin freckling (68%), associated benign non-cardiac myxomatous tumours (57%), endocrine neoplasms (30%), and a high frequency of familial cardiac myxoma (25%) and familial endocrine tumours (14%). The two types of cardiac tumour were different (syndrome vs sporadic): atrial location, 87% vs 100%; ventricular location, 13% vs 0%; single tumour, 50% vs 99%; multiple tumours, 50% vs 1%; and recurrent tumour, 18% vs 0%.

Focal left ventricular wall motion abnormalities were recognised in five patients with sarcoidosis. Three patients showed abnormal regional wall motion in the basal portion of the ventricular septum and free wall with sparing of the apex. The angiographic appearances supported the echocardiographic findings which were atypical of ischaemic heart disease. The remaining two patients both had diffuse left ventricular hypokinesia, with a focal abnormality that was most pronounced in the anteroapical region; this pattern is often seen with coronary disease. The recognition by echocardiography or angiography of focal abnormalities of wall motion affecting the basal portion of the ventricular septum should suggest the possibility of myocardial sarcoidosis even in the absence of recognised systemic manifestations.\r"

A single strut chorda from each of 23 valves (14 from necropsy specimens and nine from valve replacement surgery) was studied. The degree of molecular organisation of collagen in unstained 7 micron sections of the chordae was assessed by measuring the retardation of polarised light by the sample. Sections from each tendon were examined, after staining with Movat's pentachrome, for the presence of proteoglycan infiltration and classified as normal or abnormal on that basis. The imbibition analysis results were grouped accordingly. The retardation in the collagen in the seven chordae with proteoglycan infiltration was significantly lower than in the 16 normal chordae, indicating decreased molecular organisation. Five of the seven abnormal chordae with proteoglycan infiltration and decreased retardation were from patients with floppy mitral valves; the other two were from normal necropsy specimens. Although proteoglycan infiltration may not be a specific marker for floppy valve disease, its presence is associated with decreased molecular organisation of collagen in the chordae. Degradation of the ground substance bound to the collagen is the most plausible explanation for the measured optical changes.\r"

Echocardiograms showed good left ventricular function and a large coil of apparent thrombus in the right atrium prolapsing into the right ventricle. Intermittent loss of pacemaker sensing and capture was noticed on admission and probably caused the supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that occurred before an exploratory bypass operation. At operation rupture of the papillary muscle was found and the mitral valve was replaced. A large piece of thrombus was retrieved from the right pulmonary artery. The right heart contained no clot and the pacemaker wire was not displaced. It is envisaged that the strand of venous thrombus was caught in the permanent pacing wire at the tricuspid valve level resulting in an unusual case of pacemaker malfunction. The eventual poor outcome was almost certainly influenced by the arrhythmias and pulmonary embolism caused by the clot and might have been avoided by early operation.\r"

Two levels of blockade were studied, one in which the initial response of the train-of-four has reached 10% of control and the other 50% of control. Adequate recovery was considered to be present when the ratio of the fourth response to the first (train-of-four ratio) had reached 70%. Neostigmine always accelerated recovery and \"neostigmine block\" was not detected. This acceleration of recovery after neostigmine was most marked with the greater degree of blockade, but two doses of neostigmine were no more effective than one. Spontaneous recovery to the train-of-four ratio of 70% was slow, in the order of 1 h after an initial dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 and 45 min after incremental doses of 0.2 mg kg-1. It is concluded that antagonism of atracurium with one dose of neostigmine is usually desirable, that two doses are unnecessary, and that spontaneous recovery is slower than is generally realized.\r"

Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. Adequate antagonism of neuromuscular blockade, defined as a sustained TOF ratio of 0.7 or more, was attained in all 20 patients given neostigmine and in 13 out of 20 given edrophonium. Five of the remaining seven patients given edrophonium had shown three or less responses to TOF stimulation before antagonism. While the time to onset of the action of edrophonium (22 s) was not significantly shorter than neostigmine (26 s), the time taken to attain a TOF ratio of 0.7 was significantly shorter with edrophonium (67 s compared with 194 s with neostigmine). It is concluded that edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1 does not consistently antagonize vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, particularly if there are three or less responses to a TOF stimulation present before antagonism.\r"

  ".W": "In 39 healthy patients antagonism, by neostigmine 0.07 mg kg-1 or edrophonium 0.8 mg kg-1, of neuromuscular blockade induced by vecuronium or atracurium, was compared. Reversal was attempted when the height of the single twitch (TH) had recovered spontaneously to 5% of the control value. The evoked responses, initially single twitch, then train-of-four (TOF) were observed until the TOF ratio was 70%. Induced recovery from TH 5% to 25% was shorter following edrophonium than following neostigmine with both vecuronium (P less than 0.05) and atracurium (P less than 0.05). The recovery indices and times until TH was 75% of control and until the TOF ratio was 70% were not different. The time from a TH of 75% to a TOF ratio of 70% was shorter following neostigmine than following edrophonium with both vecuronium (P less than 0.01) and atracurium (P less than 0.01). Edrophonium had a much more variable effect on vecuronium than on atracurium. These results show that although the onset of action of edrophonium was faster than that of neostigmine, this did not lead to a faster clinical recovery, and antagonism by edrophonium may be delayed in a number of patients if vecuronium is the neuromuscular blocker.\r"

A 20-gauge Teflon cannula was used in all patients and velocity of flow measured with a Doppler velocimeter probe. A majority of arteries showed a reduction of flow velocity for 24-72 h after the removal of the cannula, with evidence of improvement at 120 h. In six arteries--three in each group--flow ceased altogether after 24-72 h. No disability of either hand or foot resulted.\r"

The isolated sinus was connected to a servo-controlled pressure generator which kept mean intrasinus pressure, pulse pressure, and frequency of pulsation constant. The carotid sinus baroreceptor nerve action potentials (NAP) were measured, together with the intransinus and systemic pressures. Following control measurements, the end-tidal concentrations of halothane in oxygen were varied between 0.0 and 2%, in random increments of 0.5%, each with 30 min of stabilization. The carotid sinus NAP response to halothane was biphasic in a dose-dependent manner. The series was repeated after neural blockade of the contralateral sinus with 1% lignocaine 2-3 ml. This blockade enhanced all NAP responses (P less than 0.001), suggesting that a central inhibitory effect, initiated by the contralateral sinus, had been removed.\r"

All subjects receiving aminophylline had tremor and irritability, whereas after salbutamol there were no noticeable systemic or psychological effects.

Some morphological and cultural differences between these cells and normal keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskins were observed, although there was no evidence that wart-derived keratinocytes were 'transformed'. The cultures were tested for evidence of HPV-DNA replication using 32P-labelled HPV-DNA probes, for the production of viral capsid proteins using peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining and for whole virus particles using electron microscopy. Fifty-seven per cent (8 of 14) of the wart cultures tested showed persistence of HPV-DNA (5-100 copies HPV-DNA/cell genome equivalent). However, no viral proteins or particles were detected in any culture. This system may prove to be a useful in vitro model for the study of virus-cell interaction and the role of HPV in the malignant conversion of epithelial cells.\r"

Neutrophils were seen in one atopic eczema patient, but were not observed in the remainder, nor in the skin of the aspirin-pretreated normal subjects.

In most lesions, the superficial A-type naevus cells stained most heavily, while staining was weaker in the deeper B- and C-type naevus cells. The intensity of staining was not, however, homogeneous in the cells of the various layers of the naevus. S-100 protein was especially abundant in giant naevus cells which occurred in the vicinity of sub-epidermal A-type naevocytes. Cells from neurocutaneous melanosis contained extremely large amounts of S-100 protein. Normal melanocytes in the epidermis over dermal naevi contained variable amounts of S-100 protein, but mainly showed weak staining. However, in the basal epidermis of traumatized naevi there were many unusually large and partly dendritic melanocytes. In this part of the epidermis, S-100 protein-positive cells lay close together, and many stained strongly. In earlier work, large amounts of metabolic enzymes were found at the same sites in traumatized naevi and giant cells. These results suggest that a high degree of expression of S-100 protein is due to metabolic activity shown, for example, by giant naevus cells and basal melanocytes of the regenerating epidermis over traumatized naevi.\r"

  ".U": "87185247\r", 
  ".W": "In a 7-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy, with photosensitivity and hypertrichosis, the diagnosis of familial porphyria cutanea tarda was confirmed by the characteristic pattern of urinary porphyrin excretion, diminished erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase and elevated plasma porphyrin index with emission maxima at 617-618 nm. The patients were treated with a combination of low-dose oral chloroquine and oral S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM); in one case alkalinization of urine was also applied. Complete clinical and biochemical recovery was achieved within 3 months. No adverse ophthalmological or other side-effects were observed. We propose that the treatment of choice should be oral SAM (12 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks and oral chloroquine (2 X 100 mg weekly) for about 120-150 days or until improvement of clinical and biochemical abnormalities is attained. So far no relapses have occurred. This combined therapy appears to be safe, simple, effective and very convenient for both patients and physicians.\r"

There was no difference between the rubella seroprevalence rates in women who were pregnant and in those who were contemplating pregnancy in the future. Likewise, women (either pregnant or non-pregnant) who were young enough to have been offered rubella vaccine at school were not more likely to be immune to rubella than were older women. Rubella seropositivity rates were not influenced by social class but significantly higher rates were found in women born in European or Arabian than in African or Asian countries. We conclude that the national scheme for rubella immunization has not reduced the number of women susceptible to rubella entering pregnancy in this Health District and that greater attention should be paid to immunization of women of child-bearing age from African or Asian countries.\r"

Blood pressure (BP), maternal heart rate and fetal heart rate (FHR) were assessed for 8 h after nitrendipine intake together with the plasma levels of nitrendipine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, plasma renin activity (PRA) and vasopressin. The mean initial systolic/diastolic BP was 158 (SEM 3.7)/108 (SEM 2.7) mmHg. Within 1 h stable, reduced mean BP-levels of 141-145/90-95 mmHg were reached and maintained for 4 h after medication. This antihypertensive effect was closely related to the maternal plasma concentration of nitrendipine, which reached a maximum of 9.1 (SEM 2.6) ng/ml 3 h after tablet intake. After 4 h, systolic and diastolic BPs slowly increased in parallel to a successive decrease in plasma concentrations of nitrendipine. Maternal heart rate increased by less than 10%, while FHR remained unchanged. No hypotensive incidents occurred. The initial mean plasma concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline, vasopressin and PRA did not change during the treatment. No major maternal and no fetal side-effects were observed.

Each parity group was divided into two groups according to the cervical score (less than or equal to 5 and greater than 5) and within those four groups the women were randomly allocated to oxytocin titration against a present frequency of 6-7 uterine contractions every 15 min, or to a preset uterine activity equivalent to the 75th centile for spontaneous labour. The length of labour was slightly, but not significantly, longer in the frequency group. The mode of delivery, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min and cord artery blood pH values were similar with the two modes of oxytocin titration. The mean maximum dose rate of oxytocin infusion was not significantly different except in the nulliparous group with a poor cervical score. The given mean total dose of oxytocin was similar in the different groups when controlled for parity and cervical score. The results suggest that oxytocin titration to achieve uterine activity values equivalent to the 75th centile of those observed in spontaneous labour does not confer any advantage compared with the traditional practice of titrating the oxytocin infusion to achieve a preset frequency of uterine contractions.\r"

The severity of pain followed the same pattern. Patients should be warned to expect increased pain on ambulation after leaving hospital. Also, there was doubling in lower abdominal pain during the first 6 h associated with the use of Falope rings for sterilization, compared with either Hulka clip sterilization or only diagnostic laparoscopy.\r"

It was isolated from the plasma of a woman who suffered a sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss and balance impairment. There was no familial history of thrombosis. By heparin-Sepharose chromatography, AT-III Rouen was separated from the normal antithrombin on elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl. AT-III Rouen eluted earlier than is normal at both pH 7.4 and pH 6.0. At the lower pH, the antithrombins bound more avidly to the column, with the abnormal AT-III eluting closer to the normal than at the higher pH. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of tryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digests of carboxymethylated antithrombins was performed on thin-layer silica plates. The abnormal peptide was located by tryptophan staining, and amino acid analysis and sequence studies demonstrated a substitution of an arginine at residue 47 for a histidine. Results from this study suggest that replacement of arginine 47 by a partially positively charged histidine has less effect on the heparin binding affinity than dose replacing it with a neutral cysteine side chain as in AT-III Toyama, in which no heparin binding was observed. In addition, heparin binding per se is not a sufficient condition to activate AT-III.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG) is elevated in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but it also is elevated in other thrombocytopenic disorders traditionally considered to be nonimmune. Consequently it is possible that elevated PAIgG is a nonspecific finding secondary to thrombocytopenia. To study this issue we developed a rabbit model of immune and nonimmune mediated thrombocytopenia. The mechanism of the thrombocytopenia was validated by platelet survival studies. Immune thrombocytopenia was produced by injection of antirabbit platelet serum that was raised in guinea pigs. Nonimmune aregenerative thrombocytopenia was produced by irradiation of the animals; nonimmune consumptive thrombocytopenia was produced by injection of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). PAIgG was measured in a direct binding assay using 125I-labeled staphylococcal protein A (SpA). Washed platelets from normal, nonthrombocytopenic rabbits bound an average of 81 molecules of SpA per platelet (81 +/- 168, mean +/- 2 SD, n = 39). Infusion of the antiplatelet antiserum produced thrombocytopenia with a rise in PAIgG that was closely correlated with the level of PAIgG (r = 0.86, n = 12). The thrombocytopenia was consumptive, as shown by a very short platelet life span using 111In-labeled platelets. In contrast, both nonimmune thrombocytopenic states resulted in an equal or greater drop in the platelet count but no change in the level of PAIgG. The animals with aregenerative thrombocytopenia had normal or only moderately reduced platelet life spans; however, in every animal the level of PAIgG was not different from the nonthrombocytopenic controls, irrespective of the platelet count. Similarly, the level of PAIgG was unchanged in those rabbits with nonimmune consumptive thrombocytopenia following infusion of ADP (82 +/- 55 molecules of SpA per platelet, mean +/- SD, n = 6). These studies indicate that elevated PAIgG is a specific finding of immune thrombocytopenia and is not secondary to thrombocytopenia itself. Indirectly these results support our hypothesis that immune mechanisms contribute to more thrombocytopenic disorders than was once thought likely.\r"

  ".W": "Mepacrine uptake into platelets and bone marrow megakaryocytes was analyzed to further characterize the dense granule defects in a group of seven mouse pigment mutants that have characteristics of platelet storage pool disease (SPD). In contrast to our previous studies using electron microscopy, this method revealed that all mutants had normal numbers of dense granules. However, total mepacrine uptake in all mutant platelets was significantly diminished to less than 50% of normal uptake. Also, the flashing phenomenon observed when normal dense granules are irradiated with ultraviolet light was either greatly diminished or absent when platelets of individual mutants were similarly irradiated. Therefore the principal defect in the mutant platelets is an inability to accumulate dense granule contents rather than an absence of the granules. Mepacrine uptake into megakaryocytes was indistinguishable in normal and mutant mice. This indicates the mutant dense granule defects appear either very late in megakaryocyte development or early in platelet formation in correlation with development of the mature dense granule. By standard transmission electron microscopy we have not been able to detect gross structural or subcellular abnormalities in either platelets or megakaryocytes of mutant mice. It appears all seven mutants produce immature or functionally abnormal dense granules.\r"

The formation of colonies in bone marrow, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood samples is best supported by human plasma. Colony formation of some patients was dependent upon growth factors, which in this study were added in the form of medium conditioned by phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated leukocytes (PHA-LCM). Some gave rise to lymphoma colonies without PHA-LCM but improved their frequency with PHA-LCM; others were completely independent of PHA-LCM. Colonies grown in primary cultures were routinely recloned and propagated as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative cell lines with stable B cell phenotype. The cell lines showed the same immunoglobulin rearrangement pattern as that observed in the primary lymphoma sample. In addition, a significant clinical correlation was observed between culture data and clinical outcome. Survival of patients who formed lymphoma colonies at any time during their clinical course was significantly shorter than survival of patients who did not give rise to colonies (P = 0.0009). The same observation was made when the survival assessment was performed for the subset of patients studied at diagnosis (P = 0.0014).\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the products of phagocytosing neutrophils on lymphocyte transcriptional activity have been investigated using allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). When MLCs are grown crowded in round-bottomed wells, uptake of tritiated uridine is inhibited by the presence of neutrophil products. Similarly, inhibitory activity is shown by purified lactoferrin. The inhibitory factor released by neutrophils is positively identified as lactoferrin, since its activity is lost in the presence of specific antibody. In addition, inhibitory activity is lost when lactoferrin is removed by a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) column and is recovered with lactoferrin from the column. The active form of lactoferrin carries iron and the apoprotein is inactive. MLCs crowded in round-bottomed wells take up considerably more uridine than when spread in flat-bottomed wells, and it is this enhanced transcriptional activity that is inhibited by neutrophil-derived lactoferrin. Enhanced uridine uptake by crowded cultures is due to factors that can be transferred in the supernatants to promote uridine uptake by spread cultures. Neutrophil lactoferrin inhibits both production and effect of the transferable factor(s).\r"

In addition, colony formation requires cell division, while most regulation of platelet production may involve individual, nonproliferating differentiating megakaryocytes. We have developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) that makes use of an iodinated murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for platelet/megakaryocyte glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) to measure megakaryocyte production in liquid marrow culture. This assay is sensitive to 3 X 10(3) platelets (roughly 30 megakaryocytes) and linear up to 1 X 10(6) platelets, and thus it provides a useful range for quantitating megakaryocyte production in in vitro marrow culture. Significant differences (threefold to fivefold) in megakaryocyte/platelet-specific GPIIb/IIIa complex are detected between stimulated and unstimulated marrow cultures by day 7, although antigen accrual in stimulated cultures continues through at least day 16. Conditions that promote megakaryocyte growth in semisolid medium (ie, aplastic plasma and PHA-LCM) have also been facilitory in liquid culture. This rapid and sensitive assay for cell-bound GPIIb/IIIa should facilitate recognition and isolation of megakaryocyte and platelet growth factors.\r"

We have investigated whether the level of ADA activity in lymphoid leukemic cells correlates with the amount of ADA-specific RNA and/or immunoreactive protein in these cells as an initial step toward characterizing the nature of the genetic regulation of ADA expression during differentiation. We have found a good correlation between the steady state levels of ADA-specific RNA and ADA-immunoreactive protein in T lymphoblastic leukemic cell lines, mature T cell lines, a B lymphoblast cell line, and leukemic cells directly isolated from four patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Southern blot analysis of DNA from these cells shows no evidence for differences in ADA gene copy number or gene rearrangement to account for the variability in ADA expression. We conclude that levels of ADA in lymphoid leukemic cells are directly related to the amount of ADA-specific mRNA present. These findings imply that ADA expression in leukemic cells reflects either the transcriptional activity of the ADA gene or the stability of ADA mRNA in these cells.\r"

This polymorphism, absent in the normal population, is correlated with the reduction of factor XII activity and enables the identification of heterozygous factor XII deficiency. Factor XII gene deletion as the cause of Hageman trait in this family has been excluded. A restriction map has been constructed, and the TaqI polymorphic site has been localized within the 5' portion of the gene. The mutation in the polymorphic site is probably the cause of the factor XII deficiency. Data suggest the presence of one factor XII gene per haploid genome.\r"

  ".W": "Although alloantibody against the PLA1 platelet antigen is usually found in patients with posttransfusion purpura (PTP), the mechanism of destruction of the patient's own PLA1-negative platelets is unexplained. We used a sensitive immunoblot technique to detect antiplatelet antibodies in a patient with classic PTP. The patient's acute-phase serum contained antibodies against three proteins present in control (PLA1-positive) platelets: an antibody that bound to a previously unrecognized platelet protein of mol wt 120,000 [glycoprotein (GP) 120], antibodies that bound to PLA1 (mol wt 90,000), and an epitope of GP IIb (mol wt 140,000). The antibodies against PLA1 and GP IIb did not react with the patient's own PLA1-negative platelets, control PLA1-negative platelets, or thrombasthenic platelets. In contrast, the antibody against GP 120 recognized this protein in all three platelet preparations, but not in Bernard-Soulier or Leka (Baka)-negative platelets. Antibody against GP 120 was not detected in the patient's recovery serum, although the antibodies against PLA1 and GP IIb persisted. F(ab)2 prepared from the patient's acute-phase serum also bound to GP 120. These results suggest that in PTP, transient autoantibody production may be responsible for autologous (PLA1-negative) platelet destruction. In addition, alloantibodies against more than one platelet alloantigen may be found in this disease. The nature of the GP 120 autoantigen and the GP IIb-related alloantigen defined by our patient's serum remains to be determined.\r"

A similar internalization was stimulated by a monoclonal antithrombomodulin antibody. We have repeated these studies in the presence of protein C and found that endocytosis of 125I-thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes, but not 125I-antithrombomodulin-thrombomodulin complexes, is inhibited. Activated protein C did not inhibit endocytosis of thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes. Protein C inhibited both internalization and degradation of 125I-thrombin and diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP) 125I-thrombin in human lung cancer cells (A549). These effects were observed at protein C concentrations found in human plasma. Protein S had no effect on the inhibition of endocytosis of thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes by protein C. We propose that protein C may regulate the rate of endocytosis of thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes in vivo and thereby control the capacity for endothelium to activate protein C.\r"

The glycosylated recombinant [35S]EPO, purified to virtual radiochemical homogeneity, was biologically active. We studied the interaction of this labeled recombinant EPO with erythroid precursor cells from mice made anemic with phenylhydrazine. The [35S]-labeled molecule bound to erythroid precursors in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. The binding was specific for EPO, and neither insulin, transferrin, epidermal growth factor, nor multiplication stimulating activity could compete for EPO binding sites. In the presence of 0.2% sodium azide, which blocks 80% to 90% of internalization, the recombinant molecule bound with an apparent Kd of 750 pmol/L and 100 to 200 binding sites per cell at 37 degrees C. Asialo-EPO was a more effective competitor than sialated EPO for the available binding sites. Thus, the enhanced biological specific activity of asialo-EPO could result from its enhanced binding affinity. We also studied recombinant human EPO labeled with 125I and found that it also bound to the erythroid cells in a saturable and specific manner. After 90 minutes of incubation at 37 degrees C, most of the bound [35S]EPO was internalized, whereas most of the [125I]EPO remained on the cell surface. The reduced internalization of the iodinated molecule could account for the previously reported functional deficit associated with iodination.\r"

With trypsinized, labeled platelets, AK 1, SZ 1, and FMC 25 (epitope on GP IX) immunoprecipitated a membrane-bound proteolytic fragment of the GP Ib-IX complex consisting of GP IX and an congruent to 25,000 mol wt remnant of the alpha-chain of GP lb disulfide-linked to the beta-subunit. Unexpectedly, although AK 1 and SZ 1 immunoprecipitated purified GP Ib-IX complex, neither antibody immunoprecipitated the individual components of this complex, GP Ib or GP IX. When GP Ib and GP IX were recombined, however, AK 1 and SZ 1 again immunoprecipitated the reformed complex, strongly suggesting that both antibodies were recognizing an epitope present only on the intact complex. Cross-blocking studies indicated that AK 1 and SZ 1 recognized a very similar or identical epitope that was proximal to the epitope for FMC 25. Both AK 1 and SZ 1 bound to a similar number of binding sites (congruent to 25,000) on intact platelets as monoclonal antibodies directed against either GP lb or GP IX. The combined data suggests that GP lb and GP IX are fully complexed in the intact platelet membrane.\r"

Antibodies monospecific for the smaller subunit (GP135) of the fibroblast FN-R in fact specifically stained the platelet surface, as determined by FACS analysis, and reacted with a component of molecular weight (mol wt) 138,000 as shown in western blots of platelet membranes. Moreover, the same antibodies precipitated the 138,000 component together with a 160,000 protein, suggesting that the two molecules are associated in a supramolecular complex. A comparative analysis indicated that this protein complex is distinct from the GPIIb/IIIa complex, known to function as a receptor of wide specificity for fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. Differential extraction experiments revealed that the platelet 138,000 component is an integral membrane protein.\r"

The first randomly selected group underwent CT without the use of intravenous contrast medium; the second and third groups were examined both before and after the administration of contrast medium, using 16.25 g and 32.5 g iodine, respectively. In the latter two groups the CT studies were reported both before and after enhancement. In the 15 patients in the first group (no contrast medium), uncertainty as to whether disc material or fibrosis was responsible for the radiological abnormalities was expressed in the final report at six of the 20 post-surgical sites. Among the 30 patients who received contrast medium, 40 post-surgical sites were examined; at six of these sites there was no radiological cause for concern; at 16 sites there were unequivocal radiological appearances of either disc material or fibrosis. Enhancement resolved the radiological uncertainty at 13 of the remaining 18 sites, almost always by reinforcing the initial radiological opinion; this left five sites where uncertainty persisted in the final report. The larger dose of contrast medium caused the more marked enhancement of those abnormalities considered to be due to fibrosis, although enhancement was readily recognised using the lower dose. While intravenous enhancement assists radiological interpretation at those sites where diagnostic uncertainty persists after routine CT, it would seem that it is not essential in patients in whom routine CT studies show no serious abnormality or the characteristic appearances of disc material or fibrosis.\r"

Magnetic resonance may provide information to aid in differentiation of a wide variety of disorders causing diffuse pulmonary abnormality and might also prove helpful in differentiating acute inflammation from pulmonary collapse or fibrosis. In some disorders, such as lobar emphysema, cystic adenomatoid malformation and sequestration, the findings on the magnetic resonance scan alone will permit a correct diagnosis to be made in many cases. It is believed that magnetic resonance imaging has more potential for pulmonary imaging than has previously been recognised.\r"

  ".W": "The reproducibility of T1 measurements using an MD 800 magnetic resonance imager operating at 0.08 T (3.4 MHz) has been assessed by repeated imaging over a 15-week period of a phantom containing six copper-sulphate solutions of different dilutions. The standard pulse sequence of this scanner with an inversion time of 200 ms and a repetition time of 1 s was used. Reproducibility was excellent for the lower T1 range (less than 350 ms), but greater variability was observed at higher T1 values (greater than 490 ms). A linear relationship between T1 and temperature has been demonstrated and a method for standardising T1 values obtained at different temperatures is described.\r"

  ".W": "Local control of Ewing's sarcoma was analysed in a series of 67 patients treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy as well as combination chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was employed with or without surgery in 60 patients and produced an overall local control rate of 55%; complete excision of the primary lesion seemed to be beneficial. There was a marked variation in control rates depending on the site of the primary lesion: limb 85%, rib 53%, pelvis 31% and other sites 33%. Primary tumours greater than 10 cm in diameter were significantly less likely to be controlled. Using daily fractions of approximately 180 cGy, total doses in excess of 6000 cGy seem more likely to produce serious late morbidity and may not increase the local control rate. No cases of second malignancy arising in irradiated tissue have been observed to date, but one patient developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\r"

No significant difference was found between the two groups in their relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate at the point of spontaneous precipitation. SF and N urines seem to have an equal driving force for particle precipitation. The major difference between them was in the volume of particles with diameters greater than 11.4 microns. SF urines showed an approximately 5-fold increase in total particle volume (after evaporation) and N urines had about a 2-fold increase over the volume in the freshly voided urine samples. The total volume of large particles (greater than 11.4 micron) increased more than 7-fold in SF urine while only a 2-fold increase was detected in the normal urines after evaporation.\r"

In the remaining five patients with additional urinary symptoms, a functional or anatomical abnormality of the lower urinary tract was found in every patient.

A fluid load of 1 litre was administered and followed 1 h later by six separate exercises, each lasting 10 min. One of six sanitary towels was worn during each exercise. Each pad was weighed before and after use to provide information about the severity of the incontinence. In the second series (Padtest 2), 104 patients were studied. The test took the same format but the exercises were rearranged in an attempt to provide information about the importance of the individual exercises. Hand washing was found to be a very provocative test both in women with unstable and those with stable bladders. The order in which the exercises were performed did not influence the overall identification of incontinence in the 2-h test period, and this supports the conclusion that the optimum length of the test is 2 h.\r"

The median urinary excretion of 1,4-MIAA was 3.34 mg/24 h (range 1.47-4.66) in the patients with detrusor mastocytosis and 1.75 mg/24 h (range 0.18-4.30) in the other patients with a painful bladder (P less than 0.01). It was concluded from this study that patients with a painful bladder and detrusor mastocytosis had a significantly elevated urinary excretion of 1,4-MIAA compared with other painful bladder patients without mastocytosis, whose urinary excretion of 1,4-MIAA was within the normal range (0.72-2.34 mg/24 h). We suggest that the urinary excretion of 1,4-MIAA might be useful in the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis.\r"
