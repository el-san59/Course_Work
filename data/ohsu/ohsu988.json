  ".W": "The importance of zinc for human health was first documented in 1963. During the past 25 y, deficiency of zinc in humans due to nutritional factors and several disease states has now been recognized. The high phytate content of cereal proteins is known to decrease the availability of zinc, thus the prevalence of zinc deficiency is likely to be high in a population consuming large quantities of cereal proteins. Alcoholism, malabsorption, sickle cell anemia, chronic renal disease, and chronically debilitating diseases are now known to be predisposing factors for zinc deficiency. A spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe degree have now been recognized in human zinc-deficiency states. Zinc is required for many biological functions including DNA synthesis, cell division, and gene expression. It is required for the activity of many enzymes in biological systems. Recent studies indicate that zinc is needed for cell-mediated immunity.\r"

We generated a regression model for bioelectrical impedance (BI) by using deuterium dilution (2H2O) as a reference method in 32 COPD patients, aged 63 +/- 9 y (mean +/- SD), in stable pulmonary and cardiac condition. Height squared divided by resistance (Ht2/Res) correlated well with total body water (TBW) as measured by 2H2O (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001, SEE = 1.9 L). The best-fitting regression equation to predict TBW comprised Ht2/Res and body weight (r2 = 0.89, SEE = 1.8 L, P less than 0.001). BI-predicted TBW was used to estimate BI-fat-free mass (FFM) that was compared with skinfold-thickness-based FFM predictions (Anthr-FFM). Relative to BI-FFM a significant overestimation of 4.4 +/- 0.8 kg was found by Anthr-FFM. Our results suggest that BI is a useful measure of body composition in patients with severe COPD.\r"

There was no significant difference in activity level or fat-free mass (FFM) between the groups. However, LEs weighed significantly less (51 vs 55 kg) and were leaner (22% body fat vs 33%) than were SEs. Individuals with similar FFM and activity level can vary significantly in EI needs.\r"

Daily energy expenditure (24-h EE) was determined by indirect calorimetry at the end of the 2-wk maintenance period; on days 1, 7, and 28 of reduced energy intake; and on days 1 and 7 of refeeding. During the reduced-energy period, body weight decreased from 96.6 to 91.5 kg and body fat decreased from 30.4% to 27.7%. There were no significant differences in 24-h EE or energy requirements per unit body weight due to diet composition or weight loss. Maintenance metabolizable-energy (ME) requirement averaged 31.0 kcal/kg body wt. Overall, the efficiency of ME use relative to body stores was 0.87 and was greater for high-fat than for low-fat diets. There was some evidence of an increase in the efficiency of energy use of body stores after weight loss. Substrate use reflected diet composition and energy-balance status independent of changes in body composition.\r"

Among HIV patients, 40 had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 10 had AIDS-related complex (ARC). All were in stable condition and had a previous history of progressive wasting, ie, a mean body weight loss of 14.2 +/- 8.1 kg over 16.6 mo (range 2-49 ms). The mean REE was 14% higher than estimated basal energy expenditure (EBEE), according to the Harris and Benedict formula. Thirty-four patients (68%) were classified as hypermetabolic (REE greater than 110% EBEE). The best predictable variable for REE was fat-free mass (FFM), as determined by an anthropometric method (r = 0.72; P less than 0.001). The mean REE was 12% higher in HIV patients than in the control group FFM (156 +/- 19 vs 124 +/- 17 kJ.kg FFM-1.d-1). We concluded that in stable and malnourished HIV patients, the progressive wasting may be partly related to an increase in REE. The mechanism of this hypermetabolic state remains to be established.\r"

On the basis of sorptive maxima for tannic acid ranging from 5.6 to 23.7 mg/g, we conclude that adsorption of tannic acid in traditional acorn preparation methods in California and Sardinia helped make these nuts palatable. Calcium available in solution at pH 2.0 and 0.1 mol NaCl/L was 2.10 and 0.71 mg/g for the Sardinian and Californian clays, respectively. The African clays released calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, or zinc in amounts of nutritional significance from some clays but not from others. A clay recovered from an archaeological site occupied by Homo erectus and early H. sapiens was indistinguishable mineralogically, in detoxification capacity and in available minerals, from clays used in Africa today. We suggest that the physiological significance of geophagy made it important in the evolution of human dietary behavior.\r"

Samples were obtained by complete expression of alternate breasts over 24 h. Milk energy density was highly correlated with lipid concentration; both were positively related to maternal percent of ideal body weight (%IBW) at 6, 9, and 12 mo and negatively related to milk volume at 3 mo and to parity at 12 mo. Milk protein concentration was negatively related to milk volume at 6 and 9 mo and positively related to nursing frequency at 6 mo and %IBW at 9 mo. Milk lactose concentration was positively related to milk volume at 6 and 9 mo and to continued amenorrhea at 9 mo. In a subsample who completed dietary records, protein intake was positively associated with lipid concentration after 16 wk postpartum but not before. These findings suggest that milk composition is more sensitive to maternal factors such as body composition, diet, and parity during later lactation than during the first few months.\r"

Adipose tissue linolenic acid correlated negatively with serum cholesterol in both groups. Strong correlations were found between dietary intake of PUFAs and adipose tissue linoleic acid content, between PUFAs and the double-bond index, between P-S ratio and adipose tissue linoleic acid content, and between P-S ratio and the double-bond index. No significant differences in dietary intake or adipose tissue fatty acid composition were observed between NTG and HTG patients. Thus, no evidence was found for exogenous dietary influences on serum lipid concentrations. The adipose tissue linoleic acid content did reflect the dietary intake of PUFAs.\r"

A compensatory increase in 22:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 concentrations occurred in retina total lipid, EPG, and PC of FF animals.

When matched for height (n = 10) or bone age (n = 13), the CF patients still had a depressed TBN/height or TBN/lean body mass (P less than 0.05). To assess nitrogen deposition during nutritional rehabilitation, repeat TBN measurements were performed on the 21 CF patients. Nitrogen deposition ranged from -230 to 550 g/y and correlated with weight velocity (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). Increased nitrogen deposition (greater than 150 g/y) was generally associated with normal height gain (height velocity SD score greater than -2.00) and weight gain (greater than 2.0 kg/y). Decreased nitrogen deposition was associated with poor weight gain but did not preclude normal linear growth. These data suggest an important role for TBN estimations in defining protein nutritional status in children and indicate that skeletal growth can continue in the presence of minimal nitrogen deposition.\r"

Fifty-one percent of the adults had low concentrations of serum vitamin B-12, which inversely correlated with duration of macrobiotic diet practice. Urinary methylmalonic acid (MMA) excretion was inversely correlated with serum vitamin B-12, and 30% of adults sampled had high urinary MMA. Fifty-five percent of children had high urinary MMA, and MMA was higher in the group that consumed a macrobiotic diet during their entire lifetime. Children were relatively short in stature and weight, and decreased stature was associated with high urinary MMA. In both adults and children vitamin B-12 status was better with more consumption of dairy products or with higher tertile of reported frequencies of vitamin B-12 consumption of various animal products. Vitamin B-12 status appeared to be unrelated to consumption of several vegetarian foods.\r"

  ".W": "We determined pediatric age-specific normative ranges for total, phosphorylated, and nonphosphorylated thiamin in whole blood (n = 323) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 208). Whole-blood total thiamin decreased from 258 +/- 63 (mean +/- SD; age 0-3 mo group) to 214 +/- 44 nmol/L (age 3-12 mo group) in the first year of life and was stable at 187 +/- 39 nmol/L after 12 mo of age. The overall decline in whole-blood total thiamin was mainly due to a drop in phosphorylated thiamin, the biologically active form. Mean CSF total thiamin decreased from 135 +/- 42 (age 0-9-mo group) to 107 +/- 34 nmol/L (age 9-18-mo group) in the first 1.5 y of life and was stable at 84 +/- 51 nmol/L thereafter. This overall decline was due initially to a drop in nonphosphorylated thiamin and later to a drop in phosphorylated thiamin. The changes in whole blood and CSF occurred independently and probably represent metabolic and neurological maturation of the infant. Whole-blood total and phosphorylated thiamin concentrations were lower in blacks only after pubarche. Age-specific norms should be used for determining the thiamin status in infancy because thiamin concentrations are significantly higher in the first few months of life.\r"

The phytate content was varied by adding different concentrations of phytate-free and ordinary maize bran. Iron absorption decreased progressively when maize bran containing increasing amounts of phytate phosphorous (phytate P) (from 10 to 58 mg) was given. The inhibitory effect was overcome by 30 mg ascorbic acid. The inhibitory effects of tannic acid (from 12 to 55 mg) were also dose dependent. Studies suggested that greater than or equal to 50 mg ascorbic acid would be required to overcome the inhibitory effects on iron absorption of any meal containing greater than 100 mg tannic acid. Our findings indicate that it may be possible to predict the bioavailability of iron in a diet if due account is taken of the relative content in the diet of the major promoters and inhibitors of iron absorption.\r"

The simultaneous fall in hematocrit and blood pressure suggests that the changes in blood pressure may be, in part, a consequence of the decrease in hematocrit and reduction in viscosity. To examine this possibility, SHRs aged 21 d were placed on one of four diets varying in iron content. At age 28, the animals showed iron-induced variations in hematocrit (P less than 0.001) but no difference in blood pressure. Subsequent manipulation of the ratio of calcium and iron in the diets of additional groups of animals resulted in variations in hematocrit that were independent of the calcium-induced alterations in blood pressure. We conclude that the effects of calcium on blood pressure are relatively independent of its effects on hematocrit.\r"

Zinc intake was held nearly constant (mean zinc intake = 1.48 mumol.kg body wt-1.d-1) throughout the 18-d controlled feeding phase of the study by addition of extrinsic 64Zn to all formula feedings, with substitution of the extrinsic 67Zn label for some of the 64Zn when formula intrinsically labeled with 70Zn was given. Fractional absorption values of intrinsic and extrinsic zinc labels, 0.267 +/- 0.092 (mean +/- SD) and 0.282 +/- 0.086, respectively, were highly correlated (r = 0.83, P less than 0.05) and did not differ significantly. The ratio of fractional absorption of the extrinsic to that of the intrinsic label, 1.08 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD), was not significantly different from unity. The results show that extrinsic labeling by use of enriched stable isotopes is a valid means of determining zinc absorption from milk-based diets in adult humans.\r"

Yod Kratin (leaves of the lead tree) is a very popular vegetable in Thailand. It is consumed at least once a week year round, sometimes every day, together with the main meal. With a common portion size of the vegetable (20 g), iron absorption was reduced by almost 90%. As little as 5 g inhibited iron absorption by 75%. Addition of ascorbic acid partly counteracted inhibition. Adding 100 mg ascorbic acid reduced inhibition of iron absorption from 5 g Yod Kratin by half and the inhibition from 10 g Yod Kratin by a quarter. The study illustrates the marked effect of iron-binding phenolic compounds on iron nutrition and, thus, the importance of acquiring knowledge of the content of such compounds in different foods.\r"

After a 4-wk baseline period, 22 subjects were randomly assigned to receive fish oil and 24 to receive corn oil. For both 8-wk treatments there were no between-group differences in the change in blood pressure. There was a treatment difference for standing DBP when baseline values were compared with those after treatment 2; DBP decreased by 5.1 mm Hg in the fish-oil group vs 0.72 mm Hg in the corn-oil group (P = 0.024). Within groups during the first treatment, both fish oil and corn oil lowered all four blood pressure measures (P less than 0.05); blood pressures were not further lowered during the second treatment compared with the washout period. There were no significant between-group differences in laboratory safety tests or categorical side effects. Fish oil lowered triglycerides by 0.47 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). In elderly subjects, diet plus both omega-3 and omega-6 supplements (9 g/d) safely and effectively lower SBP and DBP.\r"

Using this case as an example, some important aspects of firearm injuries are discussed with special emphasis on those points that are relevant to automatic military rifles and most applicable to forensic pathology practice. Some of the pathologic features of firearm wounds are reviewed and the role of the pathologist is discussed. Lastly, the most important points that help the pathologist to determine the type or nature of a firearm death--that is, whether it is an accident, homicide, or a suicide--are discussed. Classically, the number of the firearm wounds is used to differentiate suicide from homicide. As in the case reported here, however, when an automatic rifle or a military rifle set on automatic is used, the number of wounds is not a reliable indicator of the type of death.\r"

Autopsy did not reveal any metallic or other foreign bodies that might have originated from the propellant, the cartridge, or any bulletlike material. Her injuries were thus caused by the propellant alone. 0.5 mg L-1 of the CS degradation product cyanide was detected in the cardiac blood. We also report the case of a 54-year-old man, suffering from depressive psychosis, who committed suicide with an air rifle. The lead-pointed Diabolo bullet entered his brain through the right large wing of the sphenoid bone, traversed the right temporal brain pole, damaged the right middle cerebral artery and the right optic tract, and finally lodged in the left central ganglia. There was extensive basal subdural hemorrhage and tamponade of all cerebral ventricles. Death was attributed to cerebral failure. We furthermore list another 26 cases of suicide by rarely used weapons from 1947 to 1989.\r"

The rate of suicidal jumps from HRHs did not increase during the study period. The number of fatal jumps per hotel-year correlated with the height of the interior hotel atrium. The mean age for all victims was 34 years, and 63% of victims were white males. The majority of victims were local residents who were alone when they jumped and were not registered hotel guests. Registered guests tended to jump from the floor on which their room was located whereas nonregistered individuals tended to jump from the upper-most floors in the hotel. Of 19 HRH jumps, 13 occurred from the inside. Suicide notes were found in 37% of cases. HRH jumps were least common between 6 p.m. and midnight, all decedents were dressed in street clothing, only one was heard to have screamed, and all but one were dead on the scene. Alcohol and drug involvement was minimal. We hope that this information will be useful to those who investigate such deaths and to those who study the behavioral manifestations of suicide.\r"

The chest radiograph showed metallic foreign bodies in both main bronchi; foreign bodies in the stomach were not observed clinically. The woman died from repeated cardiac arrest shortly after hospital admission. At the autopsy a screw and a nail were found in both main bronchi. The abdominal cavity contained 2 L of greenish purulent fluid and a massive fibrinoid peritonitis was observed. Two perforations of the stomach, each 1 cm in diameter, were detected. The stomach was completely filled with a mass of metallic foreign bodies, greenish fluid, and a bezoar of a total weight of 1,400 g; 422 distinguishable and mostly metallic foreign bodies were counted. Death was attributed to cardiac arrest in delayed shock after massive purulent peritonitis caused by two gastric perforations combined with obstruction of the airways by aspirated foreign bodies. Cases of massive swallowing of foreign bodies are mainly restricted to mentally handicapped persons, especially schizophrenics, whereas acute impaction of the larynx by large food particles occurs nearly exclusively in heavily intoxicated adults.\r"

One hundred twelve patients with non-small cell lung cancer adjacent to the pleural surface who underwent computed tomographic scanning and subsequent thoracotomy were entered into this study. Tumor invasion was confined to the visceral pleura in 53 patients, to the parietal pleura in 18 patients, and to intercostal muscles in 25 patients; invasion extended beyond this layer in 16 patients. The computed tomographic criteria for chest wall invasion were (1) obliteration of the extrapleural fat plane, (2) the length of the tumor-pleura contact, (3) the ratio between the tumor-pleura contact and the tumor diameter, (4) the angle of the tumor with the pleura, (5) a mass involving the chest wall, and (6) rib destruction. The computed tomographic criteria 1 and 3 were significantly related to pathologic findings. Sensitivity was 85% for criterion 1 and 83% for criterion 3, specificity being 87% and 80%, respectively. Long-term survival of patients with T3 disease critically depended on the lymph node state and completeness of resection. The adenocarcinoma cell type and the T4 category were unfavorable prognostic factors. The depth of chest wall invasion did not affect survival, except for extensive rib and soft tissue infiltration. En bloc resection yielded better results than discontinuous resection.\r"

Sixty-two of 68 patients (91%) were followed up retrospectively (5-year survival rate, 17.2%; 10-year survival rate, 4.8%). Radiosensitivity of the tumor was graded by a radiation effect scoring method devised by us, and this was found to correlate with long-term prognosis (p = 0.05). Radiotherapy \"sterilized\" malignant involvement of adventitia and draining lymph nodes in 8 patients and thereby converted \"palliative\" into potentially \"curative\" resections with a mean survival of 57.2 months in this group of patients. Preoperative radiotherapy was found to increase the survival, decrease the incidence of residual tumor at the resected stump, reduce the incidence of local recurrence, and increase the resectability rate.\r"

Sixty patients required immediate emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after angioplasty failure; 7 of these had evidence of acute myocardial infarction before angioplasty and were excluded from the study. Of the 53 patients remaining, 27 (51%) had electrocardiographic and enzyme evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. Two patients died (4%), and 10 had postoperative complications (19%). No statistical significance was noted comparing age, sex, incidence of prior myocardial infarction or myocardial dysfunction, time for revascularization, or average number of grafts completed in those with single-vessel (n = 21) versus multiple-vessel (n = 32) coronary artery disease. Postoperatively, those with multiple-vessel disease required intraaortic balloon pump support (p = 0.06) and antiarrhythmic medications more frequently than single-vessel patients (p less than 0.01) and had a higher complication rate (p less than 0.05). Although not reaching statistical significance, the data also suggest a higher death and postoperative myocardial infarction rate in patients with multiple-vessel disease. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty carries a higher morbidity and mortality than elective coronary artery bypass grafting, particularly for patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease.\r"

Of these procedures, ten were tricuspid valve replacement alone and the remainder were in combination with other valve procedures. The mean follow-up was 9.6 years (range, 4 to 18 years). The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range, 27 to 78 years). Seventy-one of the patients suffered tricuspid valve dysfunction from rheumatic heart disease. There were 13 postoperative deaths (within 30 days), giving a mortality rate of 17.8%. The actuarial survival at 10 years was 71% +/- 4.2%. Of the survivors, 49 (79.6%) were in functional class I or II. Primary tissue valve failure in the tricuspid position occurred in 1 patient 12 years after implantation and required reoperation. In another patient bioprosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis developed. There was no incidence of thromboembolic complications.

Cellular viability may partly determine long-term allograft performance. To evaluate endothelial cell viability in a rat model, valved aortic conduits were subjected to collagenase digestion. The resulting endothelial cell suspension was labeled with Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (GSA-FITC), a marker specific for vascular endothelial cells of the rat. The cells were then incubated with propidium iodide, which is excluded by viable cells. Flow cytometry evaluated endothelial cell viability by determination of percentage of GSA-FITC-positive cells that were negative for propidium iodide. Aortas were studied immediately after harvest or after storage at 4 degrees C in a nutrient medium for 3 to 21 days. Percentage of viable endothelial cells showed a progressive decline with increasing duration of storage. These results demonstrate flow cytometric measurement of endothelial cell viability, a factor of possible importance in assessing allograft storage methods, and show that endothelial viability declines with prolonged storage at 4 degrees C in a nutrient medium.\r"

The artery is dissected through a paramedian incision with retraction of the rectus muscle to the lateral side. As the inferior epigastric artery courses superiorly, it may lie in one of three positions in relation to the rectus muscle. Distal coronary anastomoses using this conduit are conventional, and the proximal anastomosis may be made to the aorta or end-to-side to an internal mammary artery or venous conduit. After preparation with dilute papaverine-Plasmalyte solution proximal sizes have ranged from 2.5 to 3.25 mm (internal diameter), and distal inferior epigastric artery sizes measured 1.5 to 2.5 mm (internal diameter). The lengths of the conduit ranged from 11.5 to 17.0 cm. Eighteen patients aged 41 to 74 years had inferior epigastric artery grafts to 19 coronary arteries. The indications for use were absent or poor-quality vein, young age with an attempt to limit vein graft, and avoidance of use of bilateral internal mammary artery grafts in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. There was one sterile wound hematoma and one late wound infection. There were no other infections and no deaths. Three patients studied postoperatively revealed widely patent inferior epigastric artery grafts.\r"

We reviewed the microbiology and medical records for any patient with a sputum culture who had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft operation in 1988 to identify patients with pneumonia according to a standard clinical definition. We found 19 cases of pneumonia through our initial review; complete medical records were found on 15 cases. Gram-negative bacilli predominated as the most common etiologic agent causing pneumonia in this cohort. There were no clusters noted. Mortality was 26.6%. Pneumonia occurred approximately 4 days after the operation. Thirty-six controls were randomly selected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations in 1988. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a history of chronic obstructive lung disease, duration of more than 2 days of mechanical ventilation after operation but before diagnosis of pneumonia, and receipt of gastric acid inhibitors (antacids or H2-blockers) were independent risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia. Only the last risk factor was amenable to intervention at the time of operation.\r"

Thirty-eight thoracotomies were performed with postoperative complications in 5 patients (5/38, 13.2%) and one postoperative death (1/38, 2.6%). Two patients had benign lesions at thoracotomy and were excluded from further survival analysis. The median survival of the remaining 24 patients after thoracotomy was 18.5 +/- 5.9 months, and the actuarial 5-year survival was 22%. Five patients (5/24, 21%) achieved a clinically complete response with preoperative chemotherapy, but all had recurrence in the lung and underwent resection of pulmonary metastases. Seven patients (7/24, 29%) achieved a partial response and had residual disease resected at thoracotomy. Twelve patients (12/24, 50%) showed either no change or disease progression while receiving chemotherapy and were referred for resection. Postthoracotomy disease-free survival and postthoracotomy overall survival did not differ significantly between the three groups. One patient in the group showing no change or progression of disease while receiving chemotherapy is alive without recurrence 57 months after initial pulmonary metastasectomy. Chemotherapy can be used for the initial treatment of pulmonary metastases from adult soft-tissue sarcomas. However, survival after resection of pulmonary metastases cannot be accurately predicted based on the clinical response to preoperative chemotherapy.\r"

We tested whether this feature would prevent sensing of signals generated by electrocautery by implanting three different models of the AICD in 4 mongrel dogs. Unipolar electrocautery was applied at maximum output to a site close to the rate-sensing leads. The devices were monitored with an AICD-check probe and by auditory monitoring of QRS synchronous tones. No sensing of the electrocautery by the device occurred. Three patients with two different AICD models (1550 and 1520) underwent five surgical procedures in which electrocautery was used. No sensing of electrocautery signals, device charging, or other device malfunction occurred.\r"

  ".W": "This study presents the late results for the first 104 consecutive patients surviving and atrial repair for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) between January 1971 and December 1978 (group 1). Mean follow-up was 12 years (range, 0.1 to 17.7 years). The actuarial survival rate at 18 years was 84.2% (70% confidence limits, 79% to 88%) for simple TGA and 93.7% (70% confidence limits, 84% to 97%) for complex TGA. Nine of the 11 deaths were sudden. Two (2.6%) of the 78 late survivors operated on for simple TGA are in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV versus 4 (26.7%) of the 15 survivors with complex TGA; the other patients are doing very well. To better assess long-term results, we report the findings for randomly obtained electrocardiograms, Holter monitor recordings, radionuclide angiographic studies, and cardiac catheterizations performed in 1987 in a larger group of 159 long-term survivors of atrial repair operated on at Ospedale Riuniti di Bergamo from January 1971 to December 1984 (group 2), which includes all of group 1. The findings confirm that the arterial switch repair is the procedure of choice for complex TGA and that there is a major incidence (approximately 10%) of systemic right ventricular dysfunction and rhythm disturbances after the atrial repair. On the other hand, our late survival rate at 18 years of 84% for simple TGA with 97.5% of the patients in functional class I is a result that should be kept in mind, especially in institutions where the arterial switch is a relatively new approach and presumably is a higher risk to cause early death.\r"

We analyzed 12 clinical and hemodynamic variables by univariate and multivariate analyses to assess the predictive factors of postoperative outcome. Multivariate analysis disclosed that cardiac arrest and associated cardiopulmonary disease were independent predictors of operative death. Long-term follow-up (range, 2 to 144 months; mean, 56 months) information was available for 55 of the 60 discharged patients: 6 had died, and 5 complained of persistent mild or severe exertional dyspnea (New York Heart Association class II). These results help assess the preoperative risk in patients undergoing pulmonary embolectomy. They also show that, in the few patients who do not benefit from optimal medical therapy, pulmonary embolectomy remains an acceptable procedure in view of the long-term results.\r"

  ".W": "The transcranial Doppler technique enabled the detection of cerebral air emboli in 10 of 10 patients during open-heart valve operations despite standard deairing procedures. With this technique, the occurrence of emboli in the right middle cerebral artery was followed continuously in patients undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement. Membrane oxygenators were used. Scattered emboli were observed during the insertion of the aortic cannula, at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, and after the declamping of the aorta with the heart beating while empty. During the period of aortic cross-clamping, no emboli were detected. Despite careful deairing procedures, the recordings indicated a large amount of emboli during filling of the empty beating heart in all 10 patients. Thus, this study indicates that cerebral emboli in open heart procedures are most likely to occur during the redistribution of blood from the heart-lung machine to the patient when the heart is beginning to eject actively, despite careful standard deairing procedures. Meticulous deairing before declamping the aorta is strongly advocated. In addition, a short period of filling of the beating heart before final closure of the aortic incision or vent may decrease the incidence of cerebral emboli. A concomitant reduction in cerebral blood flow by hyperventilation or anesthetics or both during filling of the empty beating heart may also be beneficial.\r"

This method resulted in closure of the pleuropulmonary fistula in all but 1 patient. Minor complications included pain in 1 patient and fever in 3 patients. A control study involving 24 patients with pleuropulmonary fistula was performed. Autoblood, OK-432, and tetracycline were used instead of fibrin glue. The fistula resolved in 12 patients. Complications after injection included pain in 15 patients, fever in 10, and occlusion of the chest tube in 4. With our new method, patients rarely exhibited pain and fever, and occlusion of the chest tube did not occur.\r"

Warm oxygenated blood cardioplegia has certain theoretical advantages, such as continuously supplying oxygen and substrates to the arrested heart while avoiding the side effects of hypothermia. Retrograde infusion of cardioplegia also offers certain advantages (eg, in valve operations and in patients with severe coronary artery disease) that are complementary to warm blood cardioplegia. Retrograde warm blood cardioplegia was used in 113 consecutive patients (85 men and 28 women with a mean age of 61 years) undergoing various procedures. Three percent of the patients died, 7% needed transient intraaortic balloon pump support, 6% had evidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, and 96% had spontaneous return of rhythm. There were no coronary sinus injuries. This new technique of retrograde continuous warm blood cardioplegia is a simple, safe, and reliable method of myocardial protection that may change the way we currently protect the heart intraoperatively.\r"

To examine this hypothesis we reviewed the preoperative coronary angiography of 55 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Thirty-five patients had either no lesion or a discrete lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery that did not include the septal perforator (type I anatomy). Twenty patients had a lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the origin of the first septal branch, a lesion of the first septal artery, or a pair of lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery that straddled the origin of the first septal artery; all lesions were proximal to the graft site (type II anatomy). None of the patients with type I anatomy had a major conduction disturbance after coronary artery bypass grafting. Eleven of the patients with type II anatomy had major conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting; right bundle-branch block in 1, right bundle-branch block and left anterior hemiblock in 2, left bundle-branch block in 5, and complete atrioventricular block that required pacemaker implantation in 3 (p less than 0.001). In the 20 patients with type II anatomy, the appearance of conduction disturbances correlated well with the absence of retrograde flow to the septal branches from the right coronary artery (p less than 0.01). Pathological lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery that compromise flow in the first perforator and that do not provide an adequate circulation produce localized damage and conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting. This can be predicted from the preoperative angiographic anatomy.\r"

The overall 5-year survival rate of these patients was 16% and that of curatively resected patients was 20%. There were 47 patients whose N2 disease was not recognized before operation. The 5-year survival rate of this group was 20% overall and 33% in curatively resected cases. The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with N2 disease who underwent resection (106 with clinical N2 disease and 47 with clinically unrecognized N2 disease) was 17%, and that of the 84 patients undergoing curative operations was 24%. An aggressive attitude toward surgical intervention can be advocated for patients with N2 disease on the basis of our present results.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial insulin resistance, in association with surgical stress, restricts the availability of carbohydrates and increases the load of free fatty acids (FFAs) on the heart. On theoretical grounds adrenergic drugs may be expected to aggravate this situation, whereas the opposite is expected from insulin. The influence of dopamine and a combination of dopamine (7 micrograms/kg body weight/min) and high-dose insulin (7 IU/kg) on myocardial energy metabolism was studied in 19 patients 4 to 6 hours after a coronary operation. Infusion of dopamine (7 micrograms/kg body weight/min) induced metabolic changes that may be unfavorable to the strained myocardium. There was an increase of the myocardial FFA load and a rise in myocardial oxygen expenditure by 60% to 70%. There changes were, however, not matched by an increase in myocardial substrate uptake. \"Oxygen wastage\" of FFA metabolism at high circulating catecholamine levels is suggested. There were also signs suggesting an amplified systemic trauma response: systemic oxygen consumption increased by 15%, and an increase in the arterial levels of FFAs, glucose, and ketones was observed. Divergent metabolic effects of dopamine and insulin were demonstrated. The most prominent metabolic effects of adding high-dose insulin to dopamine were a marked reduction of arterial FFA levels and a shift toward myocardial carbohydrate utilization at the expense of FFAs. Myocardial uptake of FFAs ceased. Myocardial insulin resistance may thus to a significant extent be overcome by supraphysiological doses of insulin, even during infusion of adrenergic drugs.\r"

We have studied the efficacy of r-hirudin compared with heparin in a canine model of cardiopulmonary bypass operations. Two administration regimens were used for r-hirudin: group 1, 1.0 mg/kg intracardiac bolus then intravenous bolus at 30 minutes (n = 10); and group 2, 1.0 mg/kg intracardiac bolus with 1.25 +/- 0.04 mg.kg-1.h-1 intravenous infusion (n = 8). Group 3 was given an intracardiac bolus of heparin, 1.66 mg/kg (n = 9). Aspiration of blood from the chest cavity revealed no significant difference between the three groups. Measurement of fibrin deposits in the pump line filter revealed higher amounts in the r-hirudin groups (p = 0.02). Decreases in platelets, fibrinogen, and hematocrit due primarily to hemodilution were the same in each group. The bleeding time assay showed less prolongation for r-hirudin than for heparin (p less than 0.001). No antagonist for r-hirudin was used; however, due to its short half-life all coagulation variables returned to baseline within 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass. Because r-hirudin lacks effect on platelets, is a poor immunogen, does not require a plasma cofactor, and may not require an antagonist, it may provide an alternative anticoagulant to heparin in cardiopulmonary bypass. Additional studies are, however, needed to optimize the dose and to evaluate other clinical aspects of r-hirudin.\r"

Because of multiple causes of rewarming, it is necessary to monitor temperatures at specific sites (right and left ventricular epicardium and endocardium or cavity). Thus, plastic temperature probes have been designed and fabricated to facilitate temperature monitoring at these sites. Using a bare thermocouple as a standard, in vitro comparison of metallic probes and plastic probes revealed differences of 4.0 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C and 0.7 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C, respectively (p less than 0.005). Consequently, metallic probes do not have sufficient accuracy to detect transmural temperature gradients because of \"stem effect.\" Using the plastic probes to evaluate temperature changes in porcine hearts after cardioplegia-induced hypothermia revealed a temperature rise of 1 degree C/min at all sites if control of systemic and venous return and local myocardial cooling are not provided. The use of temperature monitoring at multiple sites permits identification and prevention of various causes of myocardial rewarming and is facilitated by the use of plastic probes described herein which contain dual thermocouples.\r"

In addition to preventing myocardial rewarming from systemic and pulmonary venous return, continuous cooling of the myocardial surface must be provided. Modifications of a previously reported cooling jacket are described. These modifications include decreased width and thickness of the metal skeleton for easier application and increased malleability, respectively. Also, the double-row flow channel markedly minimizes obstruction of flow secondary to kinking and allows inlet and outlet lines to attach at adjacent points of the jacket thus minimizing obstruction of the operative field. The effectiveness of the jacket in 36 patients undergoing valve replacement and 19 patients having pulmonary thromboendarterectomy was evaluated by measurement of myocardial temperatures at multiple sites throughout aortic cross-clamping. Temperatures at all sites were maintained at 12 degrees C or less. Temperatures measured in phrenic nerve pedicles ranged from 25 degrees to 27 degrees C. During cooling, heat removal by the jacket was 330 calories/min. During maintenance of myocardial hypothermia, heat flow was 190 calories/min. Modifications of a cooling jacket facilitate usability and an array of sizes enhances applicability.\r"

The patient recovered satisfactorily and underwent four further courses of chemotherapy without any complications.\r"

The dependent variables are immune status measured by CD4 and CD8 cell subsets, number of signs and symptoms commonly associated with HIV infection, and a cumulative index of HIV illness stage. We chose to focus on CD4 cell count because it is the immune marker most closely linked to the clinical consequences of HIV infection. We found no relationships between the independent variables and immune status or illness stage. The HIV-positive men who were depressed or distressed or who reported more life stressors had no greater immunosuppression or more advanced illness stage than did the others, either concurrently or across occasions. We did find a suggestive pattern of association between depressive disorders, distress, and stressors and the number of HIV-related symptoms, which warrants further study.\r"

There was no difference between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive men in the frequency of neurologic signs or of defective or borderline performance on any neuropsychological test. However, HIV-positive men performed slightly but significantly worse than HIV-negative men on tests of verbal memory, executive function, and language. Similar results were obtained when comparisons were limited to HIV-positive medically asymptomatic and HIV-negative men. There was no degradation of neurologic status or neuropsychological performance across stages of HIV severity, but neurologic and neuropsychological summary scores correlated with CD4/CD8 ratios in the HIV-positive group. Ratings of neurologic signs and symptoms correlated with neuropsychological summary scores in the HIV-positive group only. Cognitive complaints were more frequent in the HIV-positive men; they correlated with actual test performance in the HIV-positive but not HIV-negative men. The constellation of subjective and objective neuropsychological and neurologic findings suggests the possibility of a definable syndrome associated with HIV infection in asymptomatic individuals.\r"

Subjects were evaluated using five standardized distress measures at entry and 3 months later. Among the 204 human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative subjects, mean distress measures decreased significantly after all three interventions without differential treatment effects. Among the 103 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive subjects, mean distress measures decreased significantly after the stress prevention training and did not significantly increase in the other two interventions.

Evidence linking anxiety to noradrenergic dysfunction and the presence of anxiety symptoms in both depression and panic suggest that abnormal responses to clonidine in these disorders could be due to the anxiety symptoms. To explore a possible link between \"nonspecific\" anxiety symptoms and abnormal responses to clonidine, patients with DSM-III-defined generalized anxiety disorder were given intravenous infusions of clonidine hydrochloride. Responses of plasma growth hormone, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, heart rate, blood pressure, and psychological states were determined in 11 patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 14 healthy subjects. Clonidine produced significantly smaller growth hormone responses in patients than in healthy controls. The two groups did not differ in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, heart rate, blood pressure, or psychological responses to clonidine. These results are compared with data from similar studies on patients with panic disorder and depression. The blunting of the growth hormone response to clonidine in all three disorders could be due to the presence of generalized anxiety symptoms. Subsensitivity of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoreceptors may be present in all three disorders; however, there are alternative interpretations of growth hormone blunting in response to clonidine. Blunting was observed in DSM-III-defined generalized anxiety disorder, whether or not the DSM-III-R criterion of excessive worry was also present.\r"

  ".W": "Prior reports indicate that about half of amblyopia patients successfully treated with occlusion subsequently require maintenance patching. This retrospective study was designed to discover what clinical characteristics might be associated with a stable outcome following primary occlusion. Included were 188 patients who: (1) had amblyopia related to strabismus, anisometropia or media opacity; and (2) were followed up for at least one year after successful primary occlusion. Patients who did not comply with treatment or who did not achieve equal vision were excluded. Their ages ranged from 2 to 119 months (mean 29 months). Eighty-eight patients (47%) who required no further occlusion were designated the clinically stable group (CSG). The remaining 100 (53%), who subsequently needed patching because of unequal acuities, constituted the maintenance patching group (MPG). CSG patients were older at the beginning (mean 33 months) and at the end (mean 40 months) of primary occlusion than were MPG patients (means 26 and 31 months). Primary occlusion was more likely to have been discontinued because of equal recognition acuities in CSG patients, while equal fixation behaviour or preferential looking was more likely in MPG patients. Distribution of diagnoses, severity of amblyopia at presentation, and length of follow-up were similar in the two groups. Visual outcomes at last follow-up were slightly better in the CSG (p = 0.002). We conclude that, in general, patching can be safely discontinued after the third birthday. Although follow-up after primary occlusion is important to ensure stable results in all patients, preverbal children are more likely to require maintenance patching.\r"

A sine wave grating of 1.9 cycles/degree, reversing at 1 Hz was used. It was displayed on a 100-Hz refresh rate monitor. Normal values were established to compare those from 41 eyes from patients with either primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) with minimal field loss detectable on a Humphrey perimeter, or raised IOP and/or disc changes but no field loss (OH). Those with POAG had normal central contrast sensitivity, but at 20 degrees and 25 degrees eccentricity the values were greater than 2 standard deviations above the normal mean. This was also the case for high risk OH, but not for low risk patients. All the high risk patients except one who had abnormal peripheral contrast sensitivity had possible field defects (threshold elevation at one or more points more than 5 but less than 10 dB above normal mean). Only one of those with normal peripheral contrast sensitivity had such 'suspect points'. The results are assessed in terms of screening of glaucoma suspects.\r"

This precapsular film (PCF) could be uniform but often had radial grey lines in the mid zone, holes in the paracentral region, and was occasionally rolled up in strings. Lens capsular material obtained at cataract extraction was studied in patients with and without the film. By scanning electron microscopy the PCF appeared as a friable, incomplete fibrillar layer, with rolling of the edges suggesting loose attachment. Ultrastructurally its component fibrils were from 3-6 nm in diameter, similar to the finer fibrils in pseudoexfoliation (PSX) material. Life PSX material the layer stained positively for the elastic microfibril-associated protein, fibrillin, in a lens with radial striations. These similarities suggested that the two conditions have some relationship and that the PCF may be a precursor of PSX. Finding patches of the fibrillar network in some control patients implies that the PCF is common in patients of cataract age, though seldom detected clinically.\r"

Corneal oedema as measured by ultrasonic pachymetry, and stromal disease as measured by a subjective scoring system, were closely related for 30 days after infection. Morphometric analysis of wide field specular micrographs showed that no immediate endothelial cell damage occurred in either control or HSV-1 infected corneas. Alizarin red S staining of corneas taken during the period of most severe oedema indicated no significant endothelial cell loss; however, visual inspection indicated numerous staining abnormalities. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy provided evidence of an intact endothelial layer possessing integrated infiltrating cells. Virus antigen could not be detected on endothelial cells by immunoperoxidase staining at any time during development of corneal oedema. The results indicate that corneal oedema associated with HSV-1 induced disease can occur in the absence of detectable virus replication and cytolysis of corneal endothelial cells.\r"

Our results suggest that a hyperaemic eye is likely to occur about twice as often in patients injected with gentamicin (p less than 0.001). Gentamicin is associated with more pain postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Significant manifestations of gentamicin toxicity are conjunctival oedema and capillary closure.

During the first year after thioridazine exposure retinal pigmentation evolves from a granular to a patchy or nummular appearance. However, visual function and the electroretinogram typically improve during this period. Some cases may show chorioretinal atrophy and functional loss many years later, but there is little evidence for ongoing drug-related progression. Late atrophy may represent degeneration of cells that were injured subclinically at the time of initial drug exposure. Although thioridazine toxicity produces an evolving pigmentary disturbance, functional changes must be monitored independently of fundus appearance.\r"

It is postulated that this is the reason for the higher postoperative mortality following closure of the perforation and proximal colostomy (57 per cent) or exteriorization alone (43 per cent), compared with resection of the diseased segment and exteriorization (32 per cent). Resection and exteriorization is therefore the treatment of choice is most situations.\r"

To investigate the mechanism of baroreflex suppression, we have studied the effects of the two major components of injury, blood loss and tissue damage, on baroreflex function in healthy volunteers. Baroreflex function was assessed using suction stimulation of the carotid sinus. The loss of 500 ml blood had no effect on baroreflex sensitivity. A human laboratory model of tissue injury reduced the ability of the baroreflex to compensate for a rise in blood pressure (P less than 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). We conclude that tissue damage, rather than hypovolaemia, appears to mediate the effect of injury on baroreflex function in the injured. Blockade of neural signals from damaged tissue may have a role in the treatment of injury.\r"

The in vitro responsiveness of the internal anal sphincter to noradrenaline (an important sympathetic neurotransmitter) and electrical field stimulation (known to stimulate the intrinsic innervation) has been studied. Muscle strips from eight patients with incontinence undergoing postanal repair and five controls undergoing resection for low rectal carcinoma were studied. The contraction-response curves for noradrenaline were significantly different, and the EC50, the concentration required to produce 50 per cent of maximum contraction, was higher in incontinent patients (P less than 0.001). Electrical field stimulation produced initial contractions in four of the control group which were blocked by phentolamine. This contraction was not present in the incontinent patients (P less than 0.01). These results indicate an abnormality in the adrenergic innervation of the internal anal sphincter in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence.\r"

In total 334 patients aged less than 70 years were recruited: 205 patients with colonic and 99 with rectal cancer, but there were three protocol violations and these cases are excluded from further consideration. Twenty-seven patients had a limited resection of their cancer. After 5 years' follow-up there was no significant difference in the tumour-free survival rate or in the survival rate between the treated and control groups. Twenty-nine of the 147 patients who started chemotherapy discontinued this treatment because of side-effects, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract. In 30 patients treatment was discontinued because of recurrent disease. The conclusion is that systemic administration of combination chemotherapy for colorectal cancer after operation is not worthwhile in routine clinical practice.\r"

Of those offered the test 3561 (62.6 per cent) returned it and it was positive in 210 cases (5.9 per cent). The repeat test was performed by 184 patients and was positive in 68 (1.9 per cent). All those with a positive initial test had rectosigmoidoscopy to 60 cm and a double contrast enema. A carcinoma was found in one in seven patients with a positive retest but in only one in 100 patients with a negative retest (P less than 0.001). The specificity of the test was, therefore, increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent and the sensitivity was unchanged. Rescreening was offered at a later date and increased numbers were available: 7147 patients returned the test and 369 (5.2 per cent) were positive. The test was repeated in 360 patients and 118 (1.7 per cent) were positive. A colorectal neoplasm was found in one in three of those with a positive repeat test, compared with one in seven of those with a negative repeat test. In conclusion, screening for early detection of colorectal cancer with a rehydrated Hemoccult II test may be followed by investigation of only those patients with a positive retest. Such a procedure will reduce the work-load by 60 per cent without reducing sensitivity.\r"

A further two patients had PIH demonstrated on CT which was not detected by clinical examination. The rate of PIH was similar where the stoma emerged lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle (six out of 16 patients, 37 per cent) to where the stoma emerged through the rectus (four out of 12 patients, 33 per cent). Recurrence following operative repair of PIH was common. PIH occurs more frequently than previously supposed.

These 24 women had all delivered by the vaginal route without forceps assistance. Five of the 14 had developed clinical symptoms of stress incontinence 5 years later; two of them had had a further uncomplicated vaginal delivery during this time. There was manometric and neurophysiological evidence of weakness because of partial denervation of the pelvic floor striated sphincter musculature, with pudendal neuropathy, which was more marked in those women with incontinence. These findings provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that pudendal neuropathy due to vaginal delivery persists and may worsen with time.\r"

Twelve patients complained of significant urinary symptoms. No differences in the motor function of the anal sphincters were detectable. The latency of the pudendoanal reflex was unchanged after hysterectomy. Proctometrograms demonstrated significantly increased rectal volumes and compliance in the hysterectomy group together with deficits of rectal sensory function. In the basal state a significant proximal-to-distal sigmoid colon motility gradient existed only in the control group. Following stimulation with Prostigmin, this gradient was enhanced in the control group but paradoxically reversed in the hysterectomized patients, thus constituting a functional obstruction. Denervation supersensitivity was demonstrable in two patients tested with carbachol provocation but not in control subjects. These findings suggest dysfunction in the autonomic innervation of the hindgut in some patients who had undergone hysterectomy, resulting in severe constipation.\r"

The clinical results were good to excellent in 44 cases (92 per cent) and fair in four cases (8 per cent) (two with residual dysphagia and two with gastrooesophageal reflux). Barium studies showed a decrease in oesophageal diameter and disappearance of distal narrowing but normal oesophageal emptying did not occur. Postoperative manometric studies (29 patients) revealed a significant decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and a significant increase in the length of the infradiaphragmatic segment. In the oesophageal body a recovery of peristaltic waves in the proximal third was seen in ten of the patients (34 per cent). Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring showed pathological reflux in only three of 25 patients studied, and one of these was asymptomatic. This technique is effective, improving oesophageal symptoms and controlling long-term reflux.\r"

The blood flow at intersecting staple lines and single row staple lines of the anastomosis was studied with the reference organ method 24 h after the first operation. The mean blood flow in intersecting staple lines was 0.305 ml min-1 g-1 tissue and 0.307 ml min-1 g-1 tissue for single row staple lines. The confidence interval for the reduction in blood flow for intersecting staple lines compared with non-crossing staple lines was from -16 to +17 per cent. In one animal the reduction in blood flow was 37 per cent; in all other animals there was no reduction in blood flow or a reduction less than 25 per cent. An equivalence test shows that if a reduction in blood flow exists it is most likely to be less than 30 per cent (P less than 0.001). Our data confirm that intersecting staple lines in oesophagojejunal anastomoses do not reduce mean anastomotic blood flow to a dangerous level.\r"

In the elective cases, all hernias were easily reduced. In one emergency case a gastrotomy was necessary for decompression, and in another gastrectomy was necessary because of gastric gangrene.

One hundred and thirty in situ vein (ISV), 47 reversed saphenous vein (RSV), 118 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 78 human umbilical vein (HUV) grafts were used. The indications for surgery were disabling claudication in 25 per cent of patients and limb salvage in 75 per cent. In 36 per cent of operations the distal anastomosis was above the knee and in 64 per cent it was below the knee. Overall 5-year patency rates and limb salvage rates respectively were, for ISV (41 and 69 per cent), RSV (62 and 90 per cent), PTFE (31 and 67 per cent) and HUV (29 and 59 per cent). There was no significant difference in patency among these grafts at the above-knee level, but significant differences between vein and prosthetic grafts were evident below the knee (P less than 0.001). Using a proportional hazards model the three factors that consistently correlated with late graft patency were graft type (P less than 0.001), site of distal anastomosis (P less than 0.001) and distal run-off (P less than 0.001). Overall, the results suggest that prosthetic grafts are a suitable alternative to autogenous vein when the distal anastomosis is above the knee, but vein should always be used, if available, below the knee joint.\r"

Twenty-six of these 76 patients required thoracotomy: 19 for pneumothorax and pneumatocele, and seven for haemothorax, infected lung necrosis or oesophagotracheal fistula. Most pneumothoraces were bilateral. Ten of these 26 patients required reoperation, usually for extensive persisting alveolar air leaks. Sixteen (62 per cent) of the 26 patients who had a thoracotomy and 22 (44 per cent) of the 50 patients without surgery survived.

This paper analyses hospital activity data with particular reference to those patients who had undergone a surgical procedure. The results are broadly consistent with the earlier findings of the Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths and reveal a crude mortality rate of under 15 deaths per 1000 surgical admissions. Rates as high as 280 per 1000 admissions were found for certain procedures. Since death is a relatively rare health outcome it is argued that the development of a more acceptable measure must be a priority to provide information on the vast majority of surgical patients with non-fatal outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "The prognosis and course of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the factors that affect them were assessed in a group of 1055 patients, representing an unselected (epidemiological) sample observed in the north-east (Grampian region) of Scotland for a period ranging between 1 and 60 yrs. In 7% the disease began before the age of 20 yrs, in 12% after the age of 50 yrs, and in the remainder onset was between the ages of 20 and 50 yrs. The male/female ratio was 1:1.8. Mean disease duration in those observed until death (216 patients) was 24.5 yrs, with no significant difference between the sexes. Prognosis was assessed either by the interval between onset and death or by the degree of disability over a defined period of time. Depending on the length of follow-up, just over one-quarter (26%) to over one-third (36.3%) had a benign course and between 8.0 and 17.7% had a poor prognosis. Nearly a third had a remittent (32.8%) or relapsing cumulative (34%) course and 9% had a progressive course from the start. Several factors were noted to affect the prognosis. Prognosis was significantly better, independent of sex, in those with (1) an early onset (less than 40 yrs of age); (2) retrobulbar neuritis or a brainstem lesion or sensory symptoms alone at onset; (3) short duration of initial symptoms (less than 6 months); (4) a long onset--first relapse interval (greater than 1 yr); (5) a remittent course in the beginning and (6) lack of a family history of MS. The factors which predicted a poor prognosis included: (1) a late onset (greater than 40 yrs of age); (2) progressive course from the start; (3) multiple sites of lesions initially, or a cerebellar or spinal cord lesion at the onset; (4) psychiatric or persistent urinary symptoms at the onset or within 10 yrs; (5) persistent initial symptoms (beyond 1 yr); (6) early first relapse (within 6 months); (7) a family history of MS; (8) social class status IV and V; and (9) bilaterally prolonged visual evoked potential (VEP) P100 latency. Address in childhood and at the onset of the disease, changes in the CSF and CT brain scan were not of predictive value.\r"

A striking discriminating feature from HMSN type III was an abundance of focal myelin thickenings (tomacula) present in nearly all teased fibres. Possible pathogenic implications are discussed. These cases corroborate the heterogeneity of congenital motor and sensory neuropathies.\r"

It usually develops secondary to brainstem or cerebellar disease (symptomatic RPM). Some patients, however, fail to show evidence of a structural lesion (essential RPM). A total of 287 cases with RPM from the literature including 210 cases with symptomatic and 77 cases with essential RPM have been reviewed and analysed statistically to look for criteria separating the two conditions. Patients with essential RPM usually have objective earclicks as their typical complaint which is rare in the symptomatic form. Eye and extremity muscles are never involved. The jerk frequency is lower in essential than in symptomatic RPM. Patients with essential RPM are younger and have a balanced sex distribution as compared with a male preponderance in the symptomatic form. The rhythmicity of RPM seems to be more profoundly influenced by sleep, coma and general anaesthesia in essential than in symptomatic RPM. We conclude from these results that essential RPM should be separated as a distinct clinical entity. Symptomatic RPM is a rhythmic movement disorder whose pathogenesis is quite well established. The cells of the hypertrophied inferior olives are believed to represent the oscillator. Among other possibilities, essential RPM may represent its functional analogue, based on transmitter changes only. Such a relationship could be of theoretical interest for the understanding of rhythmic hyperkinesias in general.\r"

  ".W": "Experiential phenomena that occur in temporal lobe seizures and can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures typically encompass perceptual, mnemonic and affective features, either in combination or in isolation, which commonly relate to the patient's individual past experience. These phenomena raise interesting questions concerning brain mechanisms involved in human psychophysiology. The anatomical substrates for the evocation of these phenomena are widely distributed within the temporal lobe and include temporal isocortex and limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Arguments are presented which indicate that experiential phenomena are positive expressions of temporal lobe and limbic function and do not result from its ictal paralysis. Recent concepts of parallel distributed processing (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) and the importance of parallel distributed cortical networks for higher cognitive functions (Goldman-Rakic, 1988a, b) provide a theoretical framework on which a hypothesis explaining experiential phenomena can be based. In conformity with these concepts the hypothesis assumes that temporal lobe epileptic discharge or electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures can induce the elaboration of patterns of excitation and inhibition in widely distributed neuronal networks, some of which are capable of forming a specific matrix representing the substrate of a given experience. Neuronal networks engaged in parallel distributed processing (1) have the capacity to recreate the totality of a given experience when only a fragment of the network is activated, and (2) they tolerate a great deal of degradation by random inactivation of its components or by interference through random noise without serious loss of information content. These features are compatible with the assumption that localized epileptic neuronal discharge or electrical stimulation involving some temporal lobe structures could create a matrix representing features of individual experience of the kind activated in the course of temporal lobe seizures. Such an experience could, up to a certain limit, resist the degrading influence of mounting noise which inevitably must attend seizure discharge.\r"

  ".W": "A patient (B.J.) is reported who developed severe memory impairment following a penetrating brain injury caused by a snooker cue which entered through his left nostril into the basal regions of the brain. Initially, his memory disorder had the clinical features of a dense amnesic syndrome, with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, but B.J. subsequently showed significant recovery of memory function. Formal memory testing was carried out 21 months after injury. This demonstrated marked verbal memory impairment, as severe as that seen in patients with the amnesic syndrome. On nonverbal memory tests, his impairment was relatively mild and patchy. His retrograde amnesia had regressed mainly to affect a 6 month period before the injury. On other cognitive tasks, he performed at an average or above average level, and there was no neuropsychological evidence of frontal lobe dysfunction. Neuroradiological investigations at various stages after his injury failed to demonstrate a lesion in any of the thalamic nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion in the hypothalamus in the region of the mamillary bodies. Our study demonstrates that marked, relatively focal, memory disorder after diencephalic injury can occur without direct pathology to the body of the thalamus. It also indicates that structures in or adjacent to the hypothalamus, such as the mamillary bodies, may play a more important role in human memory functioning than has hitherto been considered.\r"

  ".U": "91113859\r", 
  ".W": "A Rhesus monkey was trained to discriminate between 2 acoustic signals, preceded by visual cues, that instructed which of 2 movements to make. In 75% of the trials the visual cue correctly indicated which of the 2 acoustic signals would follow. In 25% of the trials the visual cue was misleading, readying for the wrong acoustic signal. Based on the visual cue the monkey could anticipate which acoustic signal would be presented, a possibility confirmed by behavioural analysis. Movements conforming with the acoustic instruction signals were reinforced. The activity of 65 medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and 107 primary auditory cortex (ACx) neurons was recorded during task performance. Significant response differences to anticipated vs unanticipated acoustic signals were found in 32% of the MGN and 27% of the ACx neurons. In both structures some of the affected neurons responded more vigorously to the correctly anticipated acoustic signals while others responded more vigorously to the unanticipated ones. An index of relative response intensity (RRI) was derived for each neuron by comparing its response to the sound signal in reinforced trials with that obtained in trials with no visual cues and no reinforcement (a 'blank' condition). For both MGN and ACx the analysis of RRIs revealed two anticipation-related effects. One consisted of response facilitation to anticipated sound signals together with suppression of responses to unanticipated sound signals. The other consisted of facilitation of responses to unanticipated sound signals, combined with base-line responsiveness to anticipated sounds. These effects can be interpreted to reflect a context-relevant trial by trial selection of neuronal channels which conduct information along the thalamocortical segment of the auditory system. The similarity between the effects of anticipation at the thalamic and the cortical levels suggests that the changes in excitability which underlay trial by trial neuronal selectivity occur subcortically.\r"

The imperfection of this evidence cannot be the reason, for the same evidence that was rejected earlier is accepted today. Instead, it was because the prevalent concepts of vision as a function, and of the role of the cerebral cortex in it, dominated facts and prevented acceptance of evidence showing a specialization for colour in the visual cortex. It was only after those concepts were overthrown by the demonstration of functional specialization in the visual cortex of the primate that the evidence for a colour centre in the human brain became acceptable. Today, our new knowledge of the colour areas and pathways in the primate brain allows us to give a more complete account of the pathophysiology of cerebral achromatopsia in man.\r"

  ".U": "91113861\r", 
  ".W": "The origin of fatigue in McArdle's disease is still a matter of debate. Both a reduction of muscle membrane excitability and failure of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling have been suggested as causes. We performed intermittent isometric biceps brachii contractions (80% maximal voluntary contraction, rate 30/min) under local ischaemia in 5 McArdle's disease patients and 26 healthy controls. Our results show that in McArdle's disease the exerted force is less, the surface EMG (SEMG) amplitude steadily increases, and that the power density spectrum (PDS) shifts to lower frequencies, the latter without significant differences when compared with normals. The most important finding is that muscle membrane excitability remains unimpaired during ischaemic exercise, establishing a dominant role for intramuscular lactic acid formation in the reduction of muscle fibre conduction velocity seen in normal subjects. As is indicated by the shift of the PDS towards lower frequencies, as well as by the increase in SEMG amplitude, it can be concluded that during ischaemic exercise in patients with myophosphorylase deficiency, fatigue occurs without alterations in muscle membrane excitability and is due to a failure of E-C coupling.\r"

  ".W": "During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells). The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response). The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement. Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg. Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body. Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87). Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells). Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields. Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell. Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint. The activity of combined cells during parkinsonian tremor may clarify the role of sensory feedback in tremor.\r"

Retrospectively, helpful early pointers to the diagnosis in these cases included unexplained falls, autonomic dysfunction, absence of rest tremor and failure to respond to L-dopa, but these were not always present. The pathological diagnosis could not be excluded on macroscopic examination of the striatum. Relative preservation of the putamen occurred in the 4 patients who benefited from L-dopa. The caudate nucleus was involved in all cases and there was no sparing of the large striatal neurons. In mild cases, involvement of the putamen was confined to its posterior two-thirds, dorsolaterally. With increasing severity this extended in a dorsal to ventral and posterior to anterior direction. Seven of the cases had evidence of olivopontocerebellar damage, but only 2 of these had clinical evidence of cerebellar disease. Correlation was found between the neuronal counts in caudate:putamen, striatum:nigra compacta, globus pallidus:nigra compacta, nigra compacta:locus coeruleus. The most severely involved part of the substantia nigra pars compacta was the ventrolateral zone, which projects to the dorsal putamen, the earliest site of striatal disease.\r"

  ".U": "91113864\r", 
  ".W": "Corticospinal influences on two antagonistic muscles of the shoulder were studied in 6 normal volunteers. Recordings were made of the discharges of single motor units from the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles and poststimulus time histograms constructed following either anodal electrical or magnetic cortical stimulation via the scalp. Contralateral anodal stimulation caused narrow short-latency peaks of excitation in motor units from both muscles, probably indicative of the arrival of the D or direct corticospinal volley. The size of the peaks led to estimates of the underlying excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude of 5.5 mV for the deltoid and 2.2 mV for the pectoralis motor units. Magnetic stimulation over the vertex caused multiple early peaks of excitation in motor units from both muscles but these peaks began at a greater latency than those produced by anodal stimulation. Additionally, magnetic cortical stimulation (and, occasionally, contralateral anodal stimulation) caused a previously undescribed period of medium latency excitation in both muscles. These medium latency periods of excitation differed from the earlier events in that they occurred independently of the direction of current flow in the magnetic coil. This raises the possibility that they are the consequence of stimulation of bilaterally distributed cortical motor outflow pathways. The short-latency excitation strongly suggests that, in man, corticomotoneuronal projections exist to proximal as well as distal muscles of the contralateral arm. The strength of the projection to deltoid assessed by this method is similar to that to an intrinsic muscle of the hand and significantly larger than that to its antagonist, pectoralis. The possible bilateral organization of the additional medium-latency projection to these proximal arm muscles may contribute to two characteristic clinical features after a unilateral cerebral lesion, such as stroke: the relative sparing of proximal arm strength compared with distal and, secondly, ipsilateral weakness.\r"

  ".U": "91113865\r", 
  ".W": "Passive deviation of one eye through 18 degrees, 30 degrees and 42 degrees, achieved by force applied to a sucked-on contact lens, caused the direction of visual targets seen by the other eye to be misjudged in the direction of the passive movement by an amount roughly one-sixth of the angle of passive deviation. The result was the same when the perceived direction was indicated by hand, as when the instant at which a moving target seemed straight ahead was signalled. This result is interpreted by considering that muscular efferents were identical in normal and eye-deviated subjects. The main difference between the two target localization conditions results from the proprioceptor output of the deviated eye. Our data demonstrate that the assessment of the direction of a target seen by an eye that is free to move depends in part on information received by the brain from proprioceptors in the orbit (in our case the contralateral orbit). It would be surprising if the ipsilateral orbit did not contribute as much or more. We therefore consider that this constitutes clear evidence against the pure outflow theory of visual direction judgement (Helmholz, 1867), additional to that provided by the all-or-nothing situation of complete versus incomplete oculomotor paralysis. Two models have previously been proposed to describe the function of the visual localization mechanism. Both assume that the necessary information is derived from the coding of the position of the eye in the orbit, either through a copy of the muscular activation or through eye muscle proprioception. We propose an alternative model in which both afferent and efferent signals from all actively contracted or stretched muscles provide the necessary information to the CNS. The data gathered so far from normal subjects made strabismic with a suction lens, and from a fair proportion of strabismic patients, support our model describing the mechanism of localization of a single punctate target in darkness.\r"

  ".W": "Myopathy accompanying familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is much less well documented than the paralytic attacks from which the disease derives its name. Eleven affected members of a large kinship with HPP were studied clinically and radiologically for the presence of myopathy. In 4 patients muscle biopsies were also performed and in 1 of them the histological findings obtained at autopsy were compared with the CT scans of various muscles. In another patient not previously biopsied, the specimens of both amputated legs were examined histologically. The age of the studied individuals ranged from 33 to 74 yrs. The 4 youngest patients showed no clinical signs of myopathy. However, in 2 of them CT scans demonstrated discrete hypodense lesions in the leg muscles, whereas in the other 2, muscle biopsies showed a vacuolar myopathy. The other 7 patients, all older than 50 yrs, presented both clinical and CT evidence of myopathy of proximal and distal muscles ranging from very mild to very severe, males being slightly more affected than females. In all 11 patients a mean CT grading was made that was based on the abnormalities found in the different muscle groups. The myopathy appeared to be unrelated to the history of paralytic attacks, but a strong correlation was found between age and mean CT grading. It was concluded that HPP is a myopathy with permanent muscle weakness of late onset in all the patients. The expression of the paralytic attacks is variable.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison was made of the effects of experimental intracerebral inoculation into marmosets of brain homogenates from a case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and from a member of the Wo. family with cerebral amyloid and spongiform encephalopathy--the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. All the inoculated marmosets developed spongiform encephalopathy (SE) after incubation times of 20-23 months in the CJD group and 25-32 months in the GSS group. Subsequent passage from 1 affected animal in each group resulted in SE developing after 17 months incubation. In every animal inoculated with CJD or GSS material and in the 2 passage experiments the most severely affected region of the brain was the thalamus which in all cases was almost totally occupied by vacuoles. Other grey matter masses were less severely and less consistently affected. Vacuolation was observed in the cerebellar granule cell layer as well as in the molecular layer and the brain stem was finely vacuolated in all cases. There were only minor and inconsistent differences between the disease transmitted from CJD compared with GSS and some differences between the original transmissions and the SE caused by passaged inocula. Severe astrocytic gliosis accompanied the spongiform changes but no amyloid was identified in any of the marmosets with experimentally transmitted disease. The pathogenesis of the spongiform change in the thalamus was studied in a series of marmosets by light and electron microscopy 3-22 months after the intracerebral inoculation of CJD or GSS homogenates and was compared with controls. Dilated irregularly-shaped cisternae and the large complex vacuoles typical of SE, present in abundance after 18 and 22 months incubation, were considered most probably to be derived from cisternae of neuronal smooth endoplasmic reticulum.\r"

Potential stresses before, during and after the flight are outlined, including decreased atmospheric pressure, low humidity, turbulence, inactivity and time changes. We recommend precautionary measures for passengers with certain medical conditions, such as recent myocardial infarction, pulmonary disorders, pneumothorax, cerebrovascular accidents and diabetes and for those who have recently had surgery. The policy regarding air travel for pregnant women varies with each airline, but for certain conditions associated with pregnancy supplemental oxygen should be ordered before the trip.

DESIGN: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT were performed, and the reference list of each retrieved article was checked. Only randomized trials of therapy with levamisole alone or combined with 5-FU for colon cancer without distant metastases were included. The studies were then evaluated with the use of four criteria. RESULTS: We reviewed six randomized trials, of which three satisfied our criteria. Two studies demonstrated a significant improvement in the survival rate with levamisole plus 5-FU among patients with colon cancer and pathologically confirmed metastases to adjacent lymph nodes (Dukes' stage C). A subgroup analysis in another study demonstrated a similar benefit. The toxic effects of the drugs were generally mild. The three other studies showed no difference in survival rates between the treatment groups; however, the samples were too small to detect a clinically or statistically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Because many patients with colon cancer will suffer a relapse we recommend that they be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy. For those with stage C disease not entering a clinical trial levamisole plus 5-FU is appropriate adjuvant therapy.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-two hospitals in southwestern Ontario (1 level III, 1 modified level III and 30 level II or I). PATIENTS: All pregnant women admitted to the hospitals and their infants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal and neonatal transfer status, live-born with discharge home alive from hospital of birth, stillborn, and live-born with death before discharge. RESULTS: Between 1982 and 1985 the antenatal transfer rate increased from 2.2% to 2.8% (p less than 0.003). The proportion of births of infants weighing 500 to 1499 g increased from 49% to 69% at the level III hospital. The neonatal transfer rate increased from 26.2% to 47.9% (p less than 0.05) for infants in this birth-weight category and decreased from 10.2% to 7.1% (p less than 0.03) for infants weighing 1500 to 2499 g. The death rate among infants of low birth weight was lowest among those born at the level III centre and decreased at all centres between 1982 and 1985. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal care in southwestern Ontario is regionalized and not centralized; regionalization in southwestern Ontario increased between 1982 and 1985.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison study. SETTING: Family practice unit. PATIENTS: All postpubertal, nonpregnant women who underwent a routine Papanicolaou smear during a 7-month period. INTERVENTIONS: The three devices were used in each patient in a randomized sequence. An experienced cytotechnologist blinded to the device used evaluated the slides for overall epithelial cellularity (graded from 0 [acellular specimen] to 12 [overloaded sample]), density (the number of groups of five or more endocervical cells) and size of cell clusters (5 to 10 cells per cluster [score of 1], 11 to 100 [2] or more than 100 [3]). MAIN RESULTS: Samples from 2 of the 136 women were rejected because of improper labelling of the slides or failure to use all three devices. Seventy-six (57%) of the smears obtained with the spatula and 71 (53%) with the swab had no endocervical cells, as compared with only 14 (10%) obtained with the Cytobrush (p = 0.001). The overall cellularity (and standard deviation [SD]) of the smears obtained with the Cytobrush (5.69 [SD 1.17], p = 0.001) and the spatula (5.70 [SD 1.46], p = 0.001) was significantly greater than the cellularity of those obtained with the swab (4.31 [SD 1.17]). The Cytobrush yielded significantly more groups of endocervical cells (109.84 per slide) than either the spatula (4.17) or the swab (6.25) (p = 0.001). The Cytobrush also produced larger cell clusters (1.56 [SD 0.67], p = 0.001) than either the swab (0.83 [SD 1.70]) or the spatula (0.64 [SD 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: The Cytobrush and the spatula should be used instead of the spatula alone or the spatula and the swab for collecting endocervical cells.\r"

The validity of the MHSC data was established through two substudies: one involved self-reports from a survey of elderly Manitobans, and the other involved people with confirmed diabetes enrolled in the provincial diabetes education program. SUBJECTS: Sample of 100,000 people stratified by age, sex and MHSC health region: 50,000 were aged 25 to 64 years, and 50,000 were aged 65 or more. All MHSC claims containing the ICD-9-CM code for diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes were identified. MAIN RESULTS: Of the sample 7627 people were found to have a diagnosis of diabetes, the annual prevalence being 0.8% among those 25 to 44 years of age, 3.5% among those 45 to 64 and 7.6% among those 65 or older. The annual incidence rate among those over 25 years of age was 7.8 per 1000. Of the 4556 pregnant women 25 to 44 years old 85 (1.9%) had diabetes; 23 were believed to have gestational diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence rates were similar to those determined on the basis of self-reports in Canadian and US national surveys. The use of an administrative database such as that of the MHSC will provide key information for planning health services for diabetic patients and will permit the monitoring of long-term trends in the incidence and prevalence of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been suggested that the addition of sodium to low osmolality contrast media may reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and conduction disturbances during coronary angiography. In a randomized, double blind study of 30 patients undergoing coronary angiography we therefore examined the electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects of the two low osmolality contrast media-ioxaglate (with sodium) and iohexol (without sodium). Standard ECG, aortic blood pressure, and His bundle electrocardiogram were recorded. The contrast media were well tolerated and no serious arrhythmias were observed. Both induced a transient decrement in systolic blood pressure and reduction in heart rate 10 s following contrast injection (all P less than 0.01). Ioxaglate prolonged the QT interval at 10 s (P less than 0.01) and also when analysed for the whole observation period (120 s) (P less than 0.05), whereas iohexol did not cause any significant changes in the QT-interval. The AH-interval was prolonged by ioxaglate at 10 s (P less than 0.01), but not altered by iohexol. Thus, other factors than osmolality and sodium content might contribute to QT prolongation, since only the contrast agents with sodium (ioxaglate) induced QT prolongation in this study.\r"

By law, each state PRO must select 10 procedures for precertification. Coronary angioplasty has been chosen by 45 PROs for precertification and criteria in each state were developed with the advice of local physicians. This report describes the findings of a survey of these precertification criteria in an effort to determine their variability and to compare the PRO criteria to published national criteria created by expert panels. Current precertification criteria of Medicare beneficiaries show significant variability in the priorities and the clinical practice of cardiologists in performing coronary angioplasty, despite established and published guidelines for its safe and efficacious use. It is likely that the establishment of locally based criteria for coronary angioplasty will be geographically uneven and probably have a less than expected impact on the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.\r"

By the femoral approach, a 5F cobra or twist catheter was advanced selectively into the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) over a plastic-coated guidewire. In 29 patients, the GDA was successfully catheterized, and the GEA grafts were clearly visualized by the injection of 3-7 ml of contrast medium. GDA catheterization was unsuccessful in 8 patients, but in 4 of them the grafts were well visualized when 15-20 ml of contrast was injected. In the other 4 patients, visualization of the GEA grafts was poor, but the distal portions were outlined by retrograde perfusion from the native right coronary arteries. A total of 34 GEA grafts were patent (92%), and the diameters of these grafts were adequate when compared with respective recipient coronary arteries (2.8 +/- 0.9 and 2.3 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively; P less than .05). No complications were noted except for transient vasospasm (3 patients) in the GEA, hepatic artery, or both, which was relieved by the intra-arterial injection of isosorbide dinitrate (2.5 mg). Thus, the over-the-wire technique allows simple and safe GDA catheterization, which is essential for obtaining good visualization of GEA grafts.\r"

This severe complication occurred in two elderly women with recurrent mitral stenosis after previous surgical commissurotomy. Due to their unstable hemodynamic and clinical condition, both patients underwent emergency valve replacement. At surgery, the commissures appeared fused and heavily calcified; the chordae tendineae thickened, shortened, and fused; and the leaflets presented a large tear with sheared edges. Because the technical aspects of both procedures were unremarkable, the anatomic features of the mitral valve seemed to affect the occurrence of severe mitral regurgitation. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty should be therefore applied carefully to patients with prior surgical valvotomy, in whom the structural alterations of the mitral apparatus may predispose to severe valvular damage.\r"

All experiments were performed using cadaver tissue either mounted in a perfusion/mounting chamber (n = 10) or left in situ (n = 3). In general, a single cut was made with each of three sequentially larger atherectomy catheters (2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, and then 3.5 mm devices). The results were evaluated by angiography and by light microscopy. Nine of the 13 experiments were performed in totally occluded vessels. The mean pre-atherectomy stenosis (all specimens) was 95 +/- 3%, with a final mean postatherectomy stenosis of 21 +/- 5%. There was one vessel performation. We conclude from these preclinical studies that retrograde atherectomy with the Pullback Atherectomy Catheter is a feasible means of performing definitive atherectomy. Despite the promising potential of retrograde atherectomy, little can be said with certainty about the clinical utility of such a device at this early stage.\r"

In 1990 teams of two Nepali and one Canadian anaesthetist also conducted a survey of each of the seven 50-100 bed zonal hospitals which did not previously have a trained anaesthetist and which are now staffed by graduates of the diploma program. In 1985 Nepal, with a population of 16 million, had seven trained Nepali anaesthetists all of whom worked in two hospitals in Kathmandu. By the end of 1989, 19 physicians had graduated. Seven of these continue to work in Kathmandu hospitals, nine work in zonal hospitals throughout the country and two are taking higher anaesthesia training in the United Kingdom. Additional Nepali anaesthetists have returned from training abroad, and the Society of Anaesthesiologists of Nepal, which joined the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists in 1988, now has 34 members. An annual anaesthesiology symposium is held, and weekly clinical meetings are organized in the major hospitals in Kathmandu. Anaesthetists who work in the zonal hospitals have limited supplies of drugs and equipment and opportunities for continuing medical education are virtually nonexistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Volatile anaesthetics are known to attenuate agonist-induced coronary artery constriction. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if 1.5 MAC concentrations of halothane or enflurane attenuated contractions evoked by activation of one type of Ca++ channel--the potential operator channel. In the current experiment, potential operator channels were activated by depolarizing isolated canine coronary artery rings with high concentration of K+, causing Ca++ entry and vessel contraction. Rings without endothelium were suspended for isometric force measurement in organ chambers containing aerated Krebs-Ringer solution. Maximum response to Ca++ in rings depolarized with K+ was 120 +/- 5 per cent in untreated versus 101 +/- 3 per cent in rings treated with enflurane (P less than 0.01). The maximum response was 123 +/- 6 per cent in untreated versus 111 +/- 5 per cent during halothane administration (P less than 0.05). In contrast, nifedipine 10(-9) M depressed maximum contractions from 114 +/- 5 per cent to 37 +/- 4 per cent (P less than 0.01) and nifedipine 10(-8) M depressed contractions to 30 +/- 4 per cent (P less than 0.01). In a further series of experiments, sustained contractions were depressed by continued administration of the anaesthetics, indicating no loss of anaesthetic effect with time. The results indicate that 1.5 MAC halothane and enflurane attenuate contractions of canine coronary arteries evoked by depolarization and Ca++ entry through potential operated channels. However, neither halothane nor enflurane exhibited the marked depressant effect exerted by nifedipine.\r"

H1 and H2 receptor blockade was achieved with promethazine, 5 mg.kg-1 and cimetidine 30 mg.kg-1 IV, respectively. The study demonstrated no significant effect of H1 and H2 receptor blockade on hepatic oxygen uptake and no noticeable effects of cimetidine on hepatic circulation. However, promethazine decreased total hepatic blood flow, primarily by decreasing portal blood flow; this resulted in an increase in oxygen extraction as reflected in a decreased oxygen content in hepatic venous blood. The results reject the posed hypothesis: H1 receptor antagonist promethazine decreased, while H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine did not affect hepatic blood flow and oxygen supply; hepatic oxygen demand remained unaffected during H1 and H2 receptor blockade.\r"

Protection would be most likely to occur in the circumstances of incomplete cerebral ischaemia in which there is a penumbral zone of marginal perfusion. The present investigation sought to evaluate further the protective properties of isoflurane in that circumstance. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized with 1.2 MAC concentrations of either halothane or isoflurane. At the end of four hours of MCAO, the brains were removed, sectioned and incubated in the histochemical stain 2-3-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC). An image analysis system was used to measure the area of reduced or absent TTC staining in four coronal planes spanning the distribution of the middle cerebral artery. There was no difference between halothane and isoflurane anaesthetized animals with respect to the area of brain with evidence of histochemical dysfunction. It is concluded that isoflurane is not protective (relative to the status of halothane anaesthetized control animals) when administered at 1.2 MAC concentration during four hours of focal (incomplete) cerebral ischaemia in the rat.\r"

Atropine-induced heart rate in diabetics was significantly lower than that in nondiabetics (95 +/- 14 (SD) bpm vs 109 +/- 12 bpm, P less than 0.001) and were closely related to preoperative orthostatic diastolic blood pressure change (r = 0.60, P less than 0.01). There was some correlation between the atropine-induced heart rate and preoperative RR-variation in diabetics (r = 0.50, P less than 0.05). The findings suggest that cardiac sympathetic function may also be impaired in diabetics with orthostatic hypotension.\r"

Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale and recorded with heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate. The demographic characteristics, and the incidences of primary and repeat Caesarean sections, were not different among the four treatment groups. At 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after treatment the median pain scores following butorphanol were similar and lower than those following morphine (P less than 0.05). Calculated median percentage pain relief values for butorphanol were higher than morphine at each of these times (P less than 0.05). At 90 min and 2 hr the pain scores and pain relief values were similar. Beyond 45 min the number of patients requesting supplemental medication and dropping out of the study increased progressively in both the butorphanol and morphine treated patients. The attrition profiles for butorphanol were different from morphine (P less than 0.01). The median time in the study was greater than 24 hr for morphine, and 3, 2.5 and 4 hr for butorphanol, 1, 2 or 4 mg, respectively. No patient developed a clinically important change in heart rate or blood pressure, and none experienced a decrease in respiratory rate below 12 breaths.min-1. One of 69 patients (1.4 per cent) who received butorphanol developed pruritus compared with ten (43 per cent) of 23 patients who received morphine. The global assessments of the adequacy of analgesia were indistinguishable between morphine and butorphanol. Epidural butorphanol provides safe, effective postoperative analgesia, has a prompt onset, and a limited duration.\r"

Pharmacokinetic variables were similar between the groups. The mean +/- SD Vss = 2.38 +/- 1.16 L.kg-1, Cl = 39.2 +/- 9.75 ml.min-1.kg-1 and t1/2 beta = 126 +/- 68.7 min. At the time of delivery (8-16 min), the concentration of propofol ranged from 1.91-3.82 micrograms.ml-1 in the maternal vein (MV), 1.00-2.00 micrograms.ml-1 in the umbilical vein (UV) and 0.53-1.66 micrograms.ml-1 in the umbilical artery (UA). Neonates with high UV concentrations of propofol at delivery had lower neurologic and adaptive capacity scores 15 minutes later. The concentrations of propofol were similar between groups during the infusion but they declined at a faster rate in the low group postoperatively. Maternal recovery times did not depend on the total dose of propofol but the concentration of propofol at the time of eye opening was greater in the high group than the low group (1.74 +/- 0.51 vs 1.24 +/- 0.32 micrograms.ml-1, P less than 0.01). The rapid placental transfer of propofol during Caesarean section requires propofol infusions to be given cautiously, especially when induction to delivery times are long.\r"

Serum gastrin and blood glucose concentrations were measured in ten normal children aged between 5 and 12 yr during general anaesthesia with halothane and nitrous oxide and during strabismus surgery. Fasting basal concentrations of gastrin (33.6 +/- 14.8 pg.ml-1) and of glucose (4.43 +/- 0.72 mmol.L-1) were in the normal range of values for children. Intravenous atropine (0.01 mg.kg-1), general anaesthesia with halothane in nitrous oxide and oxygen by mask for three minutes, tracheal intubation, extraocular muscle stimulation and surgical stress did not cause any variation in the mean serum gastrin concentration. On the contrary, tracheal intubation and surgical stress increased blood glucose concentrations (P less than 0.05). There was no difference in the serum gastrin levels after extraocular muscle stimulation between children with positive or negative oculocardiac reflexes (44.5 +/- 16.7 pg.ml-1 vs 38 +/- 14.7 pg.ml-1, respectively). The incidence of vomiting predischarge was 60 per cent. Serum gastrin levels did not differ between children who vomited and children who did not (44.3 +/- 18.5 pg.ml-1 vs 47.1 +/- 16.9 pg.ml-1, respectively). Vomiting after strabismus surgery cannot be attributed to high gastrin serum levels. Consequently, it is unlikely that vomiting after strabismus surgery is linked to an \"oculogastric reflex\" with the vagus nerve as the efferent pathway.\r"

The efficacy of the \"hose\" as a method of oxygen supplementation in children at low and high risk for developing postoperative hypoxaemia was also compared with the face mask. Using a Nellcor N-200 pulse oximeter, 66 infants and children (mean age 2.3 yr, range 2 mo-6 yr) were continuously monitored for 30 min upon arrival in the PACU. Patients were randomized to receive oxygen supplementation with either the face mask or the proposed \"hose\" method. The results showed a greater than 80 per cent rejection of the face mask in contrast to 100 per cent compliance with the \"hose\" method. The SaO2 measurements following 5, 15 and 30 min of O2 supplementation with the hose were all significantly higher than the SaO2 measurements obtained on room air upon arrival to the PACU. Patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease had a 20 per cent incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation upon arrival to the PACU versus 2.1 per cent of patients with no pre-existing disease. It is concluded that the \"hose\" is associated with high patient compliance and is effective in the PACU in increasing the SaO2 in children at low or high risk of developing postoperative hypoxaemia.\r"

One hundred unpremedicated ASA physical status I children ranging from two to ten years, and undergoing outpatient strabismus surgery were studied. All children received inhalational anaesthesia with halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. Neither opioids nor muscle relaxants were used. The incidence of vomiting and/or retching and the incidence of side-effects were determined in the post-anaesthesia recovery room (PARR), in the short-stay surgical unit (SSSU), and after discharge from the hospital (including the journey and the stay at home during the first postoperative day). Promethazine and droperidol were equally effective in reducing the incidence of vomiting before discharge to two and eight per cent respectively. On the contrary, the incidence of vomiting after discharge and overall were significantly less with promethazine (ten and ten per cent) than with droperidol pretreatment (54 and 56 per cent) (P less than 0.0001). Promethazine permitted the time to discharge from the hospital to be reduced to an average of three hours, without increasing the incidence of vomiting postdischarge. Promethazine pretreatment is much less expensive than droperidol pretreatment. The incidence of restlessness was significantly less with droperidol (eight per cent) than with promethazine (36 per cent) (P less than 0.001). Promethazine pretreatment demands the use of an analgesic like acetaminophen in order to reduce the incidence of postoperative pain and restlessness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean age (+/- SD) of the patients was 64.3 +/- 7.4 yr; their mean weight was 74.7 +/- 13.8 kg. Five patients underwent aneurysm repair and six had aortobifemoral grafting. Serum alfentanil concentrations were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in samples drawn at increasing intervals over a 24-hr period. A three-compartment model was fitted to the concentration versus time data. The volume of the central compartment and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) were 0.44 +/- 0.022 and 0.63 +/- 0.32 L.kg-1, respectively. Total drug clearance was 6.4 = 1.9 ml.min-1.kg-1. The elimination half-time was 3.7 +/- 2.6 hr. Patient age was positively correlated with both Vdss and elimination half-time. There were no significant correlations between the pharmacokinetic variables and the duration of aortic cross-clamping, the duration of surgery, or the rate or total volume of IV fluids infused intraoperatively. In general surgical patients, the elimination half-time of alfentanil has been reported to be 1.2-2.0 hr. Although the elimination half-time of alfentanil was longer in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, alfentanil was eliminated much faster than either fentanyl or sufentanil in this patient population.\r"

Forty-two patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups: one to receive interpleural administration of bupivacaine-adrenaline mixture (Group 1 = 22 patients) and the other standard administration of intramuscular meperidine (Group 2 = 20 patients) for postoperative pain relief. The intensity of pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively as well as at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. At the same time, FVC and FEV1.0 measurements were obtained for all patients. The group given interpleural bupivacaine had better pain relief with mean VAS of 0.6 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 1.4, 0.6 +/- 0.9 and 0.8 +/- 1.2 compared with 5.2 +/- 2.2, 5.8 +/- 2.7, 5.5 +/- 2.2 and 4.5 +/- 1.8 for patients receiving meperidine (P less than 0.001). The patients in Group 1 also had larger FVC and FEV than those in Group 2: FVC 22 +/- 14.5 per cent vs 32 +/- 15.2 per cent (P less than 0.005), FEV1.0 25 +/- 15.5 vs 38 +/- 14.8 per cent (P less than 0.001) (mean +/- SD). We conclude that the interpleural analgesia can achieve better pain relief with greater ventilatory capacity than a standard analgesic regimen in the first two days after cholecystectomy.\r"

He was treated with nitroglycerin infusion. Confirmation of a perioperative myocardial infarct was documented by postoperative 12-lead ECG and CPK-MB. A post-operative transthoracic echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic left ventricle with an anteroapical infarct. Thus transoesophageal echocardiography failed to detect an apical wall motion abnormality when the probe was placed at the midpapillary level. This limitation can be overcome by periodically obtaining apical views or by using probes with more than one imaging plane.\r"

The etiologies suggested for nailbiting include stress, imitation of other family members, heredity, a transference from the thumb sucking habit, and poorly manicured nails. Nailbiting is usually confined to the fingernails and most nailbiters bite all 10 fingers equally rather than selectively. Complications of nailbiting include damage to the cuticles and nails, secondary bacterial infection and dental problems. Treatment should be directed at any precipitating causes of stress. Reminders should only be used with the consent of the child. Care of the nails and cuticles, behavioral modification techniques, positive reinforcement, and regular follow-up are important aspects of treatment. Nailbiting, or onychophagia, is defined as the habit of biting one's nails and is a common oral habit in children and young adults. Nailbiting is embarrassing, unattractive, socially undesirable, and can predispose to the development of paronychia. Physicians are frequently consulted about nailbiting but not withstanding the prevalence of the problem, there is a surprising lack of literature on nailbiting. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the reader with the problem and to suggest appropriate approaches to treatment.\r"

Emergency room users were more likely to have single mothers and to have acute, recurrent medical conditions than were non-users. Health beliefs differed between groups by maternal report of worry about the kinds of illnesses that her child acquires. Emergency room use was predicted by: maternal marital status, maternal worry and concern that illness interferes with her child's activity, acute recurrent illnesses, hospitalization. This model may be applicable to other populations in designing intervention strategies to modify emergency room utilization.\r"

Fifty-five percent of the status offenders and 45% of the delinquents had substantiated histories of maltreatment. The percent of status offenders who had been sexually abused was seven times higher among runaways (35%) than among the other members of the group (5%). The percent of delinquents who had been physically maltreated was significantly greater among those convicted of committing violent crimes (27%) than among the non-violent delinquents (14%). Thus, maltreatment may contribute significantly to delinquent behavior.\r"

SETTING: Tertiary (n = 3) and nontertiary (n = 71) hospitals in Oregon and southwestern Washington. PATIENTS: All critically ill children admitted with respiratory failure and head trauma for 6 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Severity of illness adjusted mortality rates were determined using admission day, physiologic profiles (Pediatric Risk of Mortality score) and care modalities were assessed daily. The crude mortality rate of the tertiary patients was four times higher than for the nontertiary patients (23.4% vs. 6.0%, p less than .0001). In the tertiary patients, the numbers of outcomes were accurately predicted by physiologic profiles (observed: 30 deaths and 98 survivors; predicted: 29.3 deaths and 98.7 survivors, z = -.25, p greater than .4). However, for the nontertiary patients, the number of the deaths were significantly different than predicted (observed: 20 deaths and 315 survivors; predicted: 14.4 deaths and 320.6 survivors, z = -2.08, p less than .05). The odds ratios of dying in a nontertiary vs. a tertiary facility were about 1.1, 2.3, and 8 (p less than .05) for mortality risk groups of less than 5%, 5% to 30%, and greater than 30%. Patients in tertiary facilities received more (p less than .05) invasive (e.g., arterial catheters) and complex (e.g., mechanical ventilation) care, whereas patients in nontertiary facilities received more (p less than .05) labor-intensive care (e.g., hourly vital signs). CONCLUSIONS: Care of the most seriously ill children in tertiary pediatric ICUs could improve their chances of survival.\r"

SETTING: An 18-bed PICU admitting patients of all ages except nonsurgical neonates; within a 585-bed tertiary care pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the PICU from July 1987 to February 1988 inclusive. Of 685 admitted, 480 were followed for greater than or equal to 72 hr. METHODS: The baseline state of the patients on admission was determined by a designated intensivist using the PRISM score. Other variables included age, length of stay, and hospital day of onset of infection. Infections were identified by a designated intensivist who undertook prospective daily bedside observation, chart, radiographic, and laboratory review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Equal portions of patients had PRISM scores less than and greater than 10. Significantly more infections occurred in the high PRISM population (10.8% vs. 3.4%, p less than .001). This association held through age, service, and length of stay. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a PRISM score greater than 10 were 75%, 53%, 11%, and 97%, respectively. Bacteremias accounted for 36% of infections, skin/eye/drain site 22%, respiratory 16%, wound 15%, and urine 9%. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23%), Candida sp. (20%), and S. aureus (9%). CONCLUSIONS: A PRISM score greater than 10 on PICU admission characterizes a population within the PICU at increased risk of infection. However, 93% of patients did not develop infection and thus, a negative predictive value of 97% yields little additional information.\r"

RESULTS: The quantitative cultures of the protected brush specimen detected pulmonary bacterial infection (greater than 10(3) cfu/mL) in 49 (47.5%) patients. Subsequent follow-up confirmed pneumonia in 41 patients; in only one patient was a positive protected brush specimen culture established as a false-positive result. There were 54 patients with less than 10(3) cfu/mL and the diagnosis was excluded in 36 of them. We identified eight patients with false-negative protected brush specimen cultures. The results obtained by this technique allowed us to modify treatment in 49 (47.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The telescoping plugged catheter demonstrated significant bacterial infection in a relatively small proportion of patients in whom bacterial lung infection was suspected. This technique can be safely performed and is a sensitive and specific method to establish the cause of pneumonia, thus allowing specific treatment and the avoidance of inappropriate antibiotic therapy.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus. These patients were compared with respect to their cardiopulmonary complications with a control group who had undergone craniotomy and then compared with a control group who had undergone only abdominal surgery. RESULTS: In the study group, six patients developed major postoperative complications including development of large pleural effusions, lobar atelectasis, pneumonia, upper airway obstruction, and cardiac arrest. Three patients had minor complications including development of small pleural effusions, subsegmental atelectasis, purulent bronchitis, mild congestive heart failure, and atrial flutter/fibrillation. One patient had an unremarkable postoperative course. The first control group, whose only surgery was a craniotomy, had only one major complication. The second control group, the abdominal surgery control group, had one major and five minor complications. CONCLUSION: The particular neurologic disease, its severity, and the type of surgery performed appear to be causative factors in the high incidence of complications in the study group.\r"

SETTING: A nine-bed ICU in a 300-bed, nonteaching secondary hospital. PATIENTS: Three hundred thirty-two consecutive, unselected adults. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found a good correlation between APACHE II and MPM; their performance expressed as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was nearly the same. Goodness-of-fit between observed and expected occurrences was better for APACHE II than for admission MPM, which overestimated deaths. Because we evaluate patients early, often in the Emergency Department, we felt that a \"lead-time bias\" could explain this discrepancy. Reevaluation after initial stabilization improved the performance of the MPM model to the level of APACHE II. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation indicates that both APACHE II and MPM are good predictors of hospital outcome in our population, but the level of intensive care services received before conventional ICU admission modifies accuracy of predictive models. In any study of outcome using comparative studies of classification systems, confounding biases should be measured.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This study was designed to test whether dopexamine, a dopaminergic and beta 2-adrenergic agonist, would a) increase systemic oxygen delivery (DO2) in endotoxic dogs, and b) interfere with the ability of resting skeletal muscle to extract oxygen. There were three treatment groups (n = 6 in each group): control, endotoxin alone (E) 4 mg/kg iv, and endotoxin + dopexamine (E + D) 12 micrograms/kg.min. Data were analyzed between and within groups by split-plot analysis of variance with significance of identified differences tested post hoc by Duncan's multiple range test. Donor RBC and dextran were used after endotoxin to maintain adequate perfusion pressures, with Hct kept near 40%. Blood flow to left hindlimb muscles was decreased in controlled steps of 15 min each after stabilization. RESULTS: In E group, cardiac output (Qt), mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic DO2, and oxygen uptake (VO2) decreased despite blood volume expansion. In E + D group with similar volume expansion, dopexamine maintained Qt, systemic DO2, and VO2 near the control levels, although MAP and systemic vascular resistance were reduced. In comparison with control subjects, endotoxin increased critical DO2 in the isolated limb muscles from 4.6 to 7. mL/kg.min and decreased critical oxygen extraction from 81% to 68%. The pressure/flow relationship in the limb became flattened, indicating loss of vascular reactivity. In the E + D group, there was no further change in the pressure/flow curve nor in the critical oxygen extraction level. CONCLUSIONS: Dopexamine provided hemodynamic support for endotoxic dogs, thereby increasing total DO2 and VO2, while not altering oxygen extraction in the muscle.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the iv infusion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) could modify the early influx of neutrophils into bleomycin-injured lungs and if that would affect subsequent development of inflammation and fibrosis. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: In vivo controlled animal study performed in a university hospital pulmonary research laboratory. Male Syrian golden hamsters (100- to 110-g body weight) were divided into four treatment groups: a) No treatment; b) intratracheal bleomycin plus PGE1 infusion; c) bleomycin plus saline infusion; d) PGE1 infusion only. PGE1 (180 ng/hr.100 g) or saline were infused iv 3 to 25 hr after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin sulfate (0.5 U/0.5 mL.100 g). Total and differential counts of cells recovered by lavage, lavage fluid protein, and lung total protein and hydroxyproline levels were measured from 6 hr to 30 days later. RESULTS: PGE1 infusion reduced the influx of neutrophils 6 hr after bleomycin injury by 53% compared with saline infusion (p less than .0001), but increased inflammatory cell traffic after 24 hr for 15 days. At 4 days, protein recovered in lung lavage fluid was also decreased in PGE1-treated, bleomycin-injured animals, reflecting reduced injury to lung permeability barriers. Accumulation of lung collagen in the PGE1-treated, bleomycin-instilled hamsters tended to be lower than in the bleomycin-injured, saline-infused group at 15 and 30 days, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. Despite this fact, greater than 33% of the animals in the PGE1-treated group died, possibly indicating an increased risk of sepsis in these animals. CONCLUSIONS: PGE1 infusion can decrease early neutrophil traffic and reduce injury to the lung permeability barriers. However, this treatment augments late inflammatory events and does not significantly alter the development of fibrosis.\r"

However, this method of ventilation has been shown to impair cardiac output (Qt) in several animal species, casting doubt as to its feasibility. This study tested whether Qt could be maintained during liquid breathing by intravascular volume expansion. Seven piglets were carefully hydrated, instrumented for continuous Qt measurement, and subjected to 2 hr of liquid breathing. PaCO2 was maintained at 40 to 50 torr (5.3 to 6.7 kPa), and PaO2 greater than 80 torr (greater than 10.7 kPa). Additional colloid was given during liquid breathing if Qt decreased to less than 90% of preliquid breathing values. RESULTS: Four piglets maintained Qt throughout the liquid breathing trial with maintenance fluids only. Three piglets each required one 10 mL/kg fluid bolus for Qt 82% to 89% of the baseline value, after which Qt rapidly increased to greater than 90% of baseline. Oxygen consumption and serum lactate levels remained normal throughout liquid breathing. CONCLUSION: Qt is readily maintained during liquid breathing in properly hydrated animals.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: An experimental canine model of hemorrhagic, hypovolemic shock is described that uses oxygen debt and its metabolic consequences of lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit as independent variables for the prediction of probability of death. RESULTS: Lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit are compared with the conventional hemodynamic variables of BP and cardiac output (Qt) as predictors of outcome and are shown to be superior using a modified Kaplan-Meier probability statistic. The LD50 for oxygen debt is shown to be 113.5 mL/kg, 12.9 mmol/L for lactate, and -18.8 mmol/L for base excess (BE). Comparison is made between the ability of Qt, BP, shed blood, BE, and lactate to predict oxygen debt. CONCLUSIONS: Of the single-variable predictors, BE shows the highest explained variability. However, a combined prediction from both lactate and BE appears superior to the use of either alone. Using this regression to compute the oxygen debt, it is possible to estimate accurately the actual level of oxygen debt from the BE and lactate values obtained during hemorrhagic hypovolemia. From serial determinations over time of the increase in these biochemical variables above the oxygen debt baseline, it is possible to estimate the rate of oxygen debt accumulation and the time remaining until the LD50 will be reached as indicators of the severity of the total body ischemia resulting from hemorrhagic shock.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nitric oxide (NO), believed to be endothelium-derived relaxing factor on reperfusion injury after myocardial ischemia (MI). The effects of NO were investigated in a 6-hr model of MI with reperfusion in open-chest, anesthetized cats. A solution containing NO was infused iv starting 30 min after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, continuing through reperfusion 1 hr later, and lasting for 5.5 hr. Estimated NO concentration in the circulation was 1 to 2 x 10(-9) M. RESULTS: The areas-at-risk expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular weights were not significantly different among either of the MI groups. However, the necrotic area (expressed as a percentage of the myocardial area-at-risk) was significantly (p less than .01) lower in the NO-treated MI cats compared with the MI + vehicle group. Cardiac myeloperoxidase activities indicated that significantly (p less than .05) fewer neutrophils were attracted to the necrotic zone of the NO-treated MI cats when compared with MI cats receiving only the vehicle. Sodium nitrate (NaNO2) (pH 7.4), a major breakdown product of NO, failed to exert any protective effect in this same model of MI and reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: NO appears to provide significant myocardial protection after ischemia and reperfusion. NO may afford cardioprotection by incorporation into circulating blood cells (i.e., neutrophils, platelets), thereby inhibiting their accumulation and adherence in the ischemic region, or by a direct cardiac cytoprotective effect. Further studies using NO donors rather than NO would be an appropriate clinically relevant mode of treatment in MI.\r"

Rabbits were inoculated ip with zymosan. Blood gases and circulating leukocytes were evaluated. Survivors were killed on day 10 for microscopic studies and for the evaluation of lung lipid peroxidation through the by-product malondialdehyde. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal zymosan resulted in a marked decrease of Pao2 and circulating leukocytes, and increased cellularity of alveolar septa, interstitial edema, and increased lung malondialdehyde. Pulmonary damage was partially prevented when methylprednisolone was administered before zymosan inoculation, but not when methylprednisolone was given 24 hr later. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that a local nonseptic inflammatory stimulus may provoke remote changes to the lungs and that methylprednisolone may counteract the process only if it is administered before or very early after the onset of inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of varying circuit design and the fresh gas flow rate on the circuit work imposed by a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) circuit. DESIGN: Circuit work was measured during simulated inspiration (500 mL) with a lung model at inspiratory flow rates (V) of 40, 60, and 80 L/min during the administration of 10 cm H2O CPAP through either a modified Mapleson-A or modified Mapleson-D circuit, both alone and when connected to a face mask (i.e., simulating an intubated and nonintubated patient). Fresh gas flow was varied from 10 to 250 L/min. RESULTS: The minimum circuit work occurred at a fresh gas flow rate approximating V; however, circuit work was consistently lower for the modified Mapleson-A circuit compared with the modified Mapleson-D circuit. As the fresh gas flow rate was increased sequentially to 250 L/min, circuit work remained close to the minimum value for the modified Mapleson-A, but increased gradually with the modified Mapleson-D, e.g., from 0.017 kg.m/L at a fresh gas flow rate and V of 80 L/min to 0.035 kg.m/L at a fresh gas flow rate of 250 L/min and a V of 80 L/min. Rotation of the fresh gas flow inlet did not change the circuit work vs. fresh gas flow rate relationship. Addition of a face mask resulted in a smaller increase in circuit work for the modified Mapleson-D with increasing fresh gas flow rate. However, unlike the modified Mapleson-A circuit alone, the addition of a mask caused circuit work to increase with increasing fresh gas flow rate. CONCLUSIONS: The modified Mapleson-A circuit at a fresh gas flow rate equal to V minimizes circuit work, and hence represents an optimal CPAP circuit. The increases in circuit work at fresh gas flow rates above V that were found with the modified Mapleson-D circuit are not due to inertial differences, and are likely due to turbulent gas flow.\r"

PATIENTS: Healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: NG tonometers were placed in healthy volunteers. Some of the volunteers (n = 11) were pretreated with ranitidine to prevent secretion of protons into the gastric lumen. Others (n = 13) were untreated (i.e., gastric acid secretion was uninhibited). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gastric pHi was calculated from the arterial (HCO3-) and the tonometrically determined intraluminal PCO2 using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Intraluminal PCO2 was significantly higher in the control group (54 +/- 14 torr [7.2 +/- 1.9 kPa]) than in the ranitidine-treated group (42 +/- 4 torr [5.6 +/- 0.4 kPa], p = .02). Mean gastric luminal pH was 1.9 +/- 0.6 in the control group as compared with 6.7 +/- 0.7 in volunteers treated with ranitidine (p less than .01). Mean calculated gastric pHi was 7.30 +/- 0.11 in the untreated group and 7.39 +/- 0.03 in the ranitidine-treated group (p less than .03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that intraluminal production of CO2 from the titration of gastric HCO3- by secreted H+ can result in the underestimation of gastric pHi by tonometry. This phenomenon can be eliminated by H2-receptor blockade.\r"

Pain was reported in 24 of 44 patients (55 percent) who were more than one year after surgery, 13 of 29 patients (45 percent) more than two years, six of 16 (38 percent) more than three years, and three of ten patients (30 percent) greater than four years postthoracotomy. Pain intensity was low, but 13 patients stated that pain \"slightly\" or \"moderately\" interfered with their lives. Five of 56 patients had sufficiently severe chronic pain to require either daily analgesic use, nerve blocks, relaxation therapy, acupuncture, or referral to a pain clinic. We conclude that long-term chest wall pain is common postthoracotomy. It is generally not severe, but a small proportion of patients may experience persistent, moderately disabling pain.\r"

In situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded biopsies utilizing the Y probe revealed that bronchial and alveolar epithelium and arterial and venous endothelium of the peripheral lung retained a donor phenotype, irrespective of episodes of acute or chronic rejection (obliterative bronchiolitis) which are known to injure these cellular subsets. In contrast, migratory cells, lymphocytes and macrophages, gradually, at varying rates, infiltrated the allografted lungs, replacing preexisting donor elements. Cases of active OB were manifested by infiltration of bronchioles by sex-mismatched lymphocytes; however, in some instances, quiescent recipient lymphocytes colonized the allograft and were unassociated with histologic rejection. Macrophages of similar sex seemed to cluster together within air spaces. Use of a DNA probe for the Y chromosome and in situ hybridization techniques allow monitoring of cellular alterations over time in recipients with sex mismatched allografts.\r"

Ventilation-perfusion lung scans were routinely performed at the time of hospital admission to all but one patient (one patient was critically ill, and he died four days after DVT diagnosis because of massive PE). Lung scan findings were normal in nine of ten patients with primary DVT, and they were indetermine in the remaining patient. By contrast, perfusion defects were considered highly suggestive of PE in four patients with catheter-related DVT; two patients had indeterminate lung scans, and 13 patients had normal scans. We conclude that PE is not a rare complication in upper extremity DVT, and that patients with catheter-related DVT seem to be at a higher risk.\r"

Risk factors for PE included perioperative myocardial infarction (16 percent), atrial fibrillation (41 percent); blood type A (70 percent) (p less than 0.05), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (98 percent). Twenty-four patients were treated with anti-coagulation alone. Six died of recurrent PE; mortality was 25 percent. Seventeen patients received anticoagulation plus inferior vena cava (IVC) interruption using a Hunter balloon. There were no recurrent PEs and there was one death from myocardial infarction (6 percent). Deep vein thrombosis and PE are rare complications of OHS. Routine prophylaxis with either heparin or warfarin is unnecessary. Patients with DVT, atrial fibrillation (AF), and perioperative myocardial infarction are at high risk of PE. Aggressive diagnosis to identify major venous thrombi along with anticoagulation and early consideration of IVC interruption are recommended for these patients. Patients who have undergone OHS and who have PE are at an unusually high risk for recurrent PE with death and are more safely treated with IVC interruption and anticoagulation than anticoagulation alone.\r"

Corticosteroids supposedly may block the formation of LTB4. To determine if the effect of CS on airway disease is by reduction in LTB4, we studied serum LTB4 levels in clinically stable patients with asthma or COPD who were treated with or without CS. The LTB4 was extracted from serum and assayed by radioimmunoassay. Serum LTB4 concentrations, expressed as the mean +/- SD, were 0.36 +/- 0.15 ng/ml in ten normal controls, 0.56 +/- 0.18 ng/ml in nine asthmatic subjects, 0.67 +/- 0.2 ng/ml in eight asthmatic subjects receiving CS, 0.81 +/- 0.19 ng/ml in seven patients with COPD, and 0.97 +/- 0.29 ng/ml in eight patients with COPD receiving CS. Serum LTB4 levels in normal controls differed significantly from all groups with COPD or asthma (p less than 0.01). Levels of LTB4 in asthmatic subjects differed from levels in patients with COPD (p less than 0.03), and levels in asthmatic subjects receiving CS differed from subjects with COPD receiving CS (p less than 0.03). Concentrations of LTB4 within either the COPD or the asthmatic groups were not lower in the patients treated with CS. We conclude that serum LTB4 concentrations are higher in COPD than in asthma or normal controls and that administration of CS is not associated with low LTB4 levels. The beneficial effects of CS in obstructive airway disease appear to be mediated by mechanisms other than reduction of LTB4.\r"

Purified lymphocyte populations were isolated from BALF obtained from 18 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, six patients with lung disorders other than cancer, and ten normal control volunteers matched for age and smoking history. These cells were evaluated for NK and LAK cell lytic activity against NK-resistant LAK-sensitive tumor targets (A549 pulmonary tumor and Daudi tumor cells) and an NK-sensitive tumor (K562); LAK activity was detected in BALF from 6 of the 18 patients with cancer. The remaining patients with cancer, the subjects with pulmonary disease other than cancer, and the normal volunteers had no detectable lytic activity. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from all subjects had only NK lytic activity and did not kill the pulmonary tumor target; AMs were not tumoricidal. Interleukin-2, which is required for LAK cell activation, was detected only in BALF recovered from the six patients with pulmonary LAK lytic activity. These results demonstrate that activated LAK cells, capable of killing pulmonary tumor cells, are present in BALF of some patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. This lytic LAK cell population represents a local pulmonary response against the lung cancer in the absence of systemic tumoricidal activity. The functional status of pulmonary immune effector cells, as well as the type and quantities of cytokines in the lung determine local responsiveness to bronchogenic carcinoma and may well control the course of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term action of deflazacort (DF), a new calcium-sparing and bone-saving corticosteroid, in chronic sarcoidosis patients needing prolonged therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 40 patients with chronic histologically proved sarcoidosis requiring long-term corticosteroid therapy were treated with DF and followed for a mean period of 958 +/- 515 days (range 382-2, 068). The indication for giving corticosteroid therapy was pulmonary impairment in most (36), but also other events including hypercalcemia (2), kidney stones (5, 2 with recurrent colic), uveitis (2), lupus pernio (3), suspected heart impairment (5), hypersplenism (1), and other causes. Follow-up examination included serial ACE, chest x-ray, 67Ga lung scan, pulmonary function data, serum and urinary calcium levels. Eleven patients (UT group) were not receiving glucocorticoids when first seen at our clinic; 29 patients (PT group) were on therapy with glucocorticoids (27 wity prednisone, 2 with DF) for 870 +/- 1,128 days (range 27-4,310) RESULTS: In the PT group, DF maintained the good results previously obtained with prednisone; in this group, chest x-ray film showed improvement in 16 patients, 67Ga lung scan was better in 13, while worsening chest x-ray film findings in 1 and 67Ga lung scan in 2 was seen coincident with DF tapering. Respiratory function data showed a mild nonsignificant improvement. SACE decreased significantly from 114.6 +/- 38.7 to 91.5 +/- 37.9 nM/ml/min (p less than .05). In the UT group the results were better, as expected in a population where the action of corticosteroids did not influence the first observation. FVC increased significantly from 76.3 +/- 13.0 to 89.9 +/- 19.5 percent predicted (p less than .01); the 67Ga lung scan and chest x-ray film findings improved in all but 1 patient, and ACE dropped significantly (p less than .01) from 131.8 +/- 46.3 to 83.7 +/- 25.0. In both groups the side effects were mild, and only 2 patients discontinued the treatment, 1 for gastric ulcer, and the other for amenorrhea plus a 14 kg weight gain. CURRENT STATUS: One patient died of cancer, 9 discontinued treatment (5 because therapy was no longer necessary, 2 for the above described side effects, 2 for non-drug-related reasons), 4 dropped out and were last seen when taking DF 22.5, 18, 12 and 6 mg daily respectively. Twenty-six are continuing the drug on a long-term basis at the current mean daily dose of 12.1 +/- 7.3 mg (range 3-30). In a number of these, an attempt to discontinue DF resulted in a sarcoid relapse, and DF was restarted. CONCLUSION: DF is a good and safe approach to the long-term corticosteroid therapy of sarcoidosis.\r"

We measured serum sIL-2R-alpha levels among patients with pulmonary diseases and found that sIL-2R-alpha levels were significantly elevated in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (1,327 +/- 209 U/ml) and sarcoidosis (1,037 +/- 115 U/ml) when compared with healthy volunteers (468 +/- 49 U/ml, p less than 0.01). Among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the sIL-2R-alpha levels were high in sera from patients with extensive parenchymal lesions on the roentgenogram (2,745 +/- 705 U/ml) and patients with tuberculous pleurisy (2,111 +/- 679 U/ml). In contrast, the sIL-2R-alpha levels in tuberculous patients with minimal lesion (455 +/- 92 U/ml) or moderate lesion (1,082 +/- 189 U/ml) were not significantly elevated when compared with healthy volunteers. After the treatment with antituberculosis agents, serum sIL-2R-alpha levels decreased in accordance with improvement of roentgenographic findings and laboratory data. These results suggest that serum sIL-2R-alpha level may be useful as a monitor for the disease activity in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

Reasons for some of these associations are poorly understood. Relationships between cardiovascular disease risk factors and pulmonary function were examined in 5,115 18- to 30-year-old black and white male and female participants in the study of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s adjusted for height (FEV1/Ht2) was significantly lower in smokers than nonsmokers and in persons who reported shortness of breath; FEV1/Ht2 was correlated positively with a history of strenuous physical activity, duration of exercise on the treadmill, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It was associated negatively with skinfold thicknesses, serum triglycerides, fasting serum insulin, and the Cook Medley scale of hostility. The association between pulmonary function and heart disease risk may reflect associations with physical fitness, vigor, fatness, and lipid profiles, as well as with cigarette smoking.\r"

By two-way analysis of variance within two groups (19 normal volunteers and six sleep apnea patients), no significant effects on heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure, ventricular size, or cardiac index could be found with increasing positive intrathoracic pressures and consequent lung hyperinflation. In subjects with normal cardiac function, nasal CPAP is safe from a hemodynamic viewpoint. This simple, repeatable and noninvasive technique may be used to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of prescribed nasal CPAP on cardiac hemodynamics in individual patients.\r"
