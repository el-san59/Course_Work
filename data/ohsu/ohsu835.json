  ".W": "The use of antithrombin III (ATIII) replacement in combination with low-dose heparin therapy in prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis in patients following total hip replacement or total knee replacement was evaluated. A randomized prospective venographically controlled trial in hip replacement compared treatment with dextran 40 with a regimen of ATIII (1,500 units preoperatively and 1,000 units daily for five days) and low-dose heparin. Patients receiving ATIII/heparin had significantly higher postoperative ATIII concentrations than dextran-treated patients and also had a low incidence of venous thromboembolic disease (7 percent). The ATIII/heparin regimen was well tolerated with no increase in bleeding or significant prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Two cohorts of patients undergoing total knee replacement were studied using different doses of ATIII in combination with heparin. An initial 10 patients were treated with the same ATIII dose used for patients undergoing total hip replacement, with a 50 percent incidence of venous thrombosis. A second group of 11 patients was treated with twice the dose of ATIII, and an incidence of venous thrombosis of 27 percent was found. The higher ATIII dose resulted in significantly higher ATIII concentrations and maintained the postoperative ATIII concentration above normal. Among patients receiving prophylaxis with either warfarin. dextran, or ATIII/heparin, no clear association was found between reduced ATIII concentrations and occurrence of venous thrombosis. It is concluded that ATIII replacement following total hip or knee replacement corrects the postoperative ATIII deficiency and that the combination of ATIII and low-dose heparin is an effective prophylactic regimen following total hip replacement.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with multiple myeloma have been shown to have defective opsonization and C3 deposition. Previous studies have suggested that defective C3 deposition may be related to a failure of C3 activation in myeloma serum, the mechanism of which is unknown. We therefore decided to investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the failure in C3 activation and deposition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 10 patients from whom a total of 12 serum specimens were obtained. Normal serum was prepared from a pool of serum specimens in four healthy male donors. We evaluated, in vitro, the kinetics of C3 deposition onto zymosan using radiolabeled C3 under various conditions. We also measured the serum levels of a variety of complement components using standard methods. RESULTS: Five of 10 patients' sera demonstrated poor C3 deposition onto zymosan at all time points, whereas an additional two showed poor C3 deposition at early time points but a rebound to normal by 30 minutes. Multiple components of the classical and alternative complement pathways were decreased in many patients, with the most striking abnormalities occurring in those with the poorest C3 deposition. No single complement component abnormality was found to be common to the group. Elevations in Bb fragment concentration strongly suggest in vivo activation as the likely mechanism for depletion of alternative pathway components; the mechanism for classical pathway abnormalities is less clear. There was an inverse correlation between paraprotein concentration and abnormal C3 deposition (p less than 0.0001) and C3 (p less than 0.0005) and C4 (p less than 0.0001) concentrations. However, no consistent evidence of fluid-phase complement consumption was present. CONCLUSION: The defect in C3 activation and deposition in multiple myeloma cannot be explained on the basis of a single complement component abnormality but rather is due to a heterogeneous group of complement abnormalities. Although no correlation between in vitro abnormalities and clinical status was identified in this small group of patients, it is likely that the described complement defects play an important role in defective host defense in multiple myeloma.\r"

Quantitative overviews suggest efficacy in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, both in pharmacologic and dietary trials. Within-treatment group analyses (as observational epidemiologic studies) of the clinical trials and overview analyses of the aggregate outcome of the trials (as proper randomized experiments) are consistent with the results of population-based epidemiologic surveys: they disclose a continuous decrease in coronary heart disease risk with decreasing levels of total plasma cholesterol over a wide range of values. Integrated with knowledge of the distribution of plasma cholesterol levels in populations, these results indicate that there is a major potential for control of the contemporary epidemic of coronary heart disease by a combined high-risk individual and general population intervention approach to the reduction of plasma cholesterol levels.\r"

Current research on the influence of certain species of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoproteins on atherosclerosis and its complications has the potential to widen the scope of intervention strategies. Available evidence is, however, sufficient to warrant a broad-based effort to translate into clinical practice our ability to lower cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "The benefit of lowering elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and preventing coronary artery disease is now well documented. The guidelines formulated by the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults provide a rational approach to lipid level management. Once an elevation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level has been confirmed in an accurate and precise laboratory, the initial step in therapy remains regulation of diet. Pharmacologic intervention is recommended only if patients do not achieve desirable low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after an adequate period receiving regulated diet. The guidelines provide a mix of specific low-density lipoprotein level cutoff points and additional cardiovascular risk factors on which to base decisions in regard to drug therapy. The initial approach should be monotherapy with either a bile acid binding resin or nicotinic acid, with selection based on a variety of factors, including patient age, sex, and the severity and exact type of lipid disorder. Should difficulties or inadequate control occur with either of these agents, the hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be utilized, since their ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is significantly greater than that of the other available agents. If inadequate control is obtained with monotherapy, combination therapy is recommended. Optimal combinations of drugs and dosages have yet to be fully assessed and will ultimately depend on patient acceptance, efficacy, side effects, and cost effectiveness. Severely affected subjects may require triple-drug therapy. Other agents, such as fibric acid derivatives and probucol, have only a limited role when elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is the only abnormality. In patients with combined hyperlipidemias, especially when the very low-density lipoprotein level is significantly increased, the fibrates may even be used for initial therapy.\r"

This review describes preclinical toxicology findings associated with simvastatin administration in animals and provides the rationale for our conclusion that these changes are not indicative of potential human toxicity. Although it was not surprising to find that a potent inhibitor of this key biochemical pathway produces toxicity at high dosages in animals, none of the observed changes poses a significant risk to humans at clinical dosages. Many of the toxicities produced by high dosage levels of simvastatin in animals are directly related to the drug's biochemical mechanism of action and are the result of a profound, sustained inhibition of the target enzyme that is not anticipated at clinical dosages. Furthermore, several of the simvastatin-induced changes are species-specific responses to this agent and are not relevant to human risk assessment. Of the treatment-related changes reported for simvastatin, the development of cataracts in dogs has received considerable attention. The available data demonstrate a wide margin of safety in terms of dosage levels required to elicit this response as well as the plasma concentrations associated with the development of these ocular lesions. The data suggest that the development of lenticular opacities at clinical doses of simvastatin is highly improbable. Overall, simvastatin is highly improbable. Overall, simvastatin was well-tolerated by animals in preclinical toxicology studies, and no findings contraindicating its use in humans were identified.\r"

There was no difference in response whether the drug was taken in one or two doses. In another study, simvastatin (40 mg per day) was compared with cholestyramine (8 to 16 g per day). After 12 weeks, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced 43 percent by simvastatin and 29 percent by cholestyramine. Combination therapy caused a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 54 percent. Simvastatin appeared also to be a potent hypolipidemic drug in 10 patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. The drug was well tolerated. Adverse effects were primarily composed of increases in serum transaminases and creatine phosphokinase. No effects of simvastatin on the production of steroid hormones were observed.\r"

Patients in stratum I (initial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 195 mg/dl) received simvastatin 5 to 10 mg once every afternoon; patients in stratum II (initial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at least 195 mg/dl) received 10 to 20 mg once every afternoon. Gemfibrozil was given in a constant dosage of 600 mg twice daily in both strata. Simvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 and 34 percent in strata I and II, respectively. The corresponding reductions brought about by gemfibrozil were 18 and 17 percent. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased by 7 and 9 percent by simvastatin and by 17 and 16 percent by gemfibrozil in strata I and II, respectively. Ratios of low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced by approximately 25 percent by simvastatin 5 to 10 mg once every afternoon and gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, but were reduced by 37 percent by simvastatin 10 to 20 mg once every afternoon. Both drugs reduced plasma triglyceride levels, but gemfibrozil was much more effective. The short-term tolerability and safety of both drugs appeared to be good during the 12-week study. The results suggest that both drugs have useful but distinctly different lipid-modifying properties.\r"

The evidence comes from autopsy studies of cardiovascular-renal changes in the first two decades of life. Cardiovascular risk factors can be identified in children just as in adults and these have a high correlation with the anatomic disease. This relationship underscores the importance of risk factor screening of children. Of interest is that clinical risk factors tend to persist within a rank (track) so that studies in childhood can be predictive of future levels. Behavior and lifestyle of eating, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and use of oral contraceptive pills influence risk factors in children. Familial aggregation of risk factors are also noted. Studies of apolipoproteins, B and A-I, have identified subsets of children that have a greater frequency of paternal myocardial infarction. The findings from the Bogalusa Heart Study and other epidemiological studies of children show the need to begin prevention of adult heart disease in early life. Approaches to prevention should include high risk families and children and a public health or population approach. Cardiovascular health education for elementary school children should be directed to children in the general population in an effort to encourage them to adopt healthy life styles.\r"

In control patients treated with anticancer drugs containing cisplatin but no supplemental urinastatin, the 24 hour urine NAG and BMG levels increased more than three-fold over the pretreatment levels, 3 days after anticancer therapy, respectively. Creatinine clearance significantly decreased and levels of BUN, serum uric acid, and BMG in control patients significantly increased over the corresponding pretreatment levels, 3 days after anticancer therapy. However, supplemental urinastatin reduced abnormalities in levels of all these factors 3 days after therapy.

The modification of the size and solubility of IC by the classical and alternative complement pathways, and the recent demonstration of the role of cellular complement receptors and IgG-Fc receptors in the handling of IC, now allow a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the severe forms of vasculitis. When complement deficiencies are present, the handling of IC is impaired, and vasculitis results. New blood tests for Factor VIII-related antigen, alkaline ribonuclease, plasma thrombospondin, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody correlate with the presence of selected types of vasculitis. In addition, tissue thromboplastin release after application of defined tourniquet pressure can also detect subtle blood vessel injury. These new tests may allow diagnosis without risky organ biopsies. Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of vasculitis will also be discussed.\r"

The ratio of glycine to valine was higher in the small-for-gestational-age fetuses and correlated significantly with the degree of fetal hypoxemia. These findings indicate that placental insufficiency is associated with a biochemical disturbance in the fetus that is similar to that observed in children with protein deprivation and kwashiorkor syndrome.\r"

A number of reports indicate that preeclampsia is associated with elevated blood levels of lipid peroxidation products. In view of its potentially destructive character, uncontrolled lipid peroxidation has been suggested as an etiologic factor in preeclampsia. The present article summarizes current information regarding the occurrence of lipid peroxidation in normal and preeclamptic pregnancy. Recent progress concerning our understanding of the process of lipid peroxidation and its role in cardiovascular disease is also reviewed. This information is used to discuss potential mechanisms by which lipid peroxidation might contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.\r"

Because the physiologic mechanism is unknown, the purpose of this study was to determine whether such waveform changes could be induced in sheep fetuses by embolization of the resistance vessels of the placenta. Seven chronically catheterized sheep fetuses were instrumented with Doppler crystals mounted on one umbilical artery. The placenta was progressively embolized from the fetal side with plastic microspheres. In all cases the umbilical arterial waveform showed a progression from normal to zero diastolic velocity with embolization. In six of seven animals diastolic velocity eventually reversed in direction before fetal death. We conclude that occlusion of placental arteries and arterioles in fetal sheep recreates the waveform changes observed in severely growth-retarded human fetuses.\r"

  ".U": "90023670\r", 
  ".W": "Whether the renin-angiotensin system is activated during rat gestation is controversial. Therefore we serially assessed plasma renin activity in unrestrained, chronically instrumented conscious rats during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Plasma renin activity was 3.26 +/- 0.30, 2.80 +/- 0.31, and 2.70 +/- 0.26 ng.ml-1.hr-1 on gestational days 6, 12, and 20, respectively. When the same rats were studied after delivery, plasma renin activity was 1.87 +/- 0.29, 1.81 +/- 0.09, and 2.31 +/- 0.35 ng.ml-1.hr-1 on postpartum days 3, 6, and 11, respectively. Levels measured during pregnancy were significantly greater than in the postpartum period (p less than 0.05 or less than 0.01). We then evaluated potential functional consequences of the renin-angiotensin system in gravid rats. Near term, renal hemodynamics fall from the peak levels of midgestation; we tested whether angiotensin II mediates this apparent vasoconstriction. Captopril (1.5 mg/kg, 1.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1) was acutely administered to lower circulating angiotensin II. The drug produced an 80% inhibition of angiotensin I pressor response, a tenfold elevation in plasma renin activity, but caused the same degree of mild renal vasodilation in rats whether they were virgin or pregnant. We also tested whether prior occupancy of receptors by endogenous hormone or receptor downregulation mediates the attenuated pressor response to angiotensin II observed during late pregnancy. Acute administration of captopril failed to augment refractory pressor responsiveness. Chronic treatment with enalaprilat (2.0 mg.kg-1.day-1 by osmotic minipump) also did not restore pressor responsiveness. But, in our hands, chronic administration of enalaprilat most likely failed to lower plasma angiotensin II. In summary, we suggest that during rat gestation (1) the renin-angiotensin system is activated, (2) angiotensin II does not mediate the apparent renal vasoconstriction observed near term, (3) prior receptor occupancy by endogenous hormone is not responsible for the attenuated pressor response to angiotensin II, and (4) long-term treatment with enalaprilat can produce hypotension without reducing plasma concentrations of angiotensin II.\r"

Bone densitometry is useful for monitoring estrogen replacement therapy to assess dose, foster compliance, and check for secondary bone loss. The most appropriate site for bone loss monitoring is probably the spine because it shows larger decreases at the menopause than appendicular sites, it shows larger increases with therapy, and it has clinical import in terms of fracture. Both dual-photon absorptiometry (or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and computed tomography are the preferred monitoring methods. The precision of these densitometry methods is generally adequate to permit interim decisions with regard to continuing therapy, as well as conclusive decisions on therapeutic efficacy after 1 to 2 years of monitoring. Judicious use of densitometry in combination with biochemical determinations can enhance therapeutic control and provide both patient and physician confidence in long-term estrogen replacement therapy.\r"

Prenatal informed consent for sonogram, a primarily autonomy-based indication, should be given the same weight in clinical judgment and practice as the beneficence-based indications listed by the National Institutes of Health consensus panel.\r"

Because of the association between states of altered insulin concentration and prostaglandin metabolism, we hypothesized that chronic experimentally induced fetal hyperinsulinemia results in perturbations in fetal arachidonic acid and prostaglandin metabolism. Arachidonic acid, thromboxane B2 (the stable breakdown product of thromboxane A2), and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (the stable breakdown product of prostacyclin) were determined in the arterial blood of chronically catheterized fetal sheep after 9 to 12 days of continuous insulin (15 U.day-1, n = 7) or placebo (n = 5) infusion. Fetal insulin infusion resulted in fetal hypoglycemia and a reduction in fetal arterial plasma arachidonic acid concentration (p less than 0.01). In addition, the concentration of thromboxane B2 relative to 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was significantly reduced in the insulin-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.03). We conclude that fetal hyperinsulinemia in sheep produces perturbations in prostaglandin metabolism with reductions in the plasma arachidonic acid concentration and in the plasma concentration of thromboxane A2 relative to prostacyclin. The hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic state in the fetus influences the relative proportion of the vasoconstricting to the vasodilating prostaglandins, thereby potentially modulating fetal vasomotor tone.\r"

Human insulin, 1000 microU/ml, was introduced into either maternal or maternal and fetal compartments. In one series of experiments placentas were used as either a control group or study group, whereas in the other series each placenta served as its own control. Metabolic effects were determined by measuring placental glucose and oxygen consumption and lactate production rate. The effect of insulin on transfer was studied by the use of 3-O-methylglucose labeled with tritium; this effect was expressed as the slope of maternal minus fetal concentrations on a natural logarithmic scale and compared with the antipyrine tagged with carbon 14. The stability of perfusate volume was used as an index for placental integrity, whereas absence of tissue edema demonstrated adequacy of perfusion. Neither of the metabolic parameters studied was significantly affected by insulin, and insulin did not have an effect on 3-O-methylglucose transfer rate. It was concluded that, in contrast to other tissues in the body, placental glucose metabolism and transfer are not sensitive to the action of insulin.\r"

Greater discriminatory information was obtained from the measurements from the superior and inferior quadrants than from the measurements from the temporal and nasal quadrants. This approach helps identify new structural markers that may more closely reflect the number of ganglion cell axons in the optic nerve. Such measurements made longitudinally in living eyes will provide valuable information about the relative rates of ganglion cell death in aging and in glaucoma.\r"

The semithin sections, treated with formic acid and beta protein immunostain, showed abundant diffuse plaques. In the adjacent ultrathin section, diffuse plaques usually showed some scattered bundles of amyloid fibrils between focally blurred membranes of cell process. The diffuse plaques were nearly undetectable without the semithin beta protein immunostained preparations, because the neuropils within these plaques appeared almost normal morphologically. Capillaries, which rarely appeared in the center of the diffuse plaques, demonstrated no amyloid fibrils in their walls. These findings suggest that in the initial stages of senile plaque formation amyloid fibrils are formed sporadically between cell processes, but not around the capillaries.\r"

Ultrastructurally, endomysial fibrosis, decreased myofibrillar density, and prominence of mitochondria were consistent features. Severe degenerative changes were present in two dogs and included prominent intracytoplasmic myelin figures, lipid droplets, and lipofuscin. Immunocytochemical studies of an affected dog confirmed the absence of dystrophin in LV myocardium.

  ".W": "Antigens were detected on the surface of erythrocytes from children with acute falciparum malaria in Madang, Papua New Guinea. These parasite-induced erythrocyte surface antigens (PIESA) were serotyped with convalescent sera from children and hyperimmune sera from adults in parasite infected cell agglutination assays (PICAs) and by inhibition of binding of infected cells to melanoma cells. Extensive serological diversity of PIESA was demonstrated. A significant correlation between serotypes defined by reactivity of immune sera in PICA and inhibition of melanoma cell binding (MCB) was observed. This suggests that both assays measure antibody responses to the same antigen(s). Increased recognition of different PIESA specificities with age is consistent with the hypothesis that repeated exposure to malaria confers immunity against a range of PIESA serotypes and parallels the development of clinical immunity to malaria in this area of Papua New Guinea.\r"

Field studies to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the DNA probe with that of light microscopy have been performed. In 2 studies in Thailand, 1,397 patients were tested. Microscope slides were prepared in a standard fashion and examined by clinical technicians and expert microscopists. The DNA probe method compares favorably in sensitivity with routine microscopy, detecting parasite densities as low as 40 parasites/microliters blood in the first study and, after modifications, 20-25 parasites/microliters blood in the second. Modifications included the elimination of salt from the lysis buffer, increasing the pH of the lysis buffer, and use of nylon based hybridization membranes instead of nitrocellulose. The DNA probe method offers the advantage of a standardized procedure that can be used in a batchwise fashion on a large number of samples.\r"

The incidence and severity of the clinical signs depended upon the method of recruitment. The 3 most common signs were pruritus and edema (both occurring in successive acute episodes affecting mainly the hands and forearms) and subconjunctival migration of adult filariae. Papulovesicular eruptions were located mainly on the arms. Headaches and arthralgia were noted more frequently than in the controls. No relation was found between the ABO blood groups and loiasis. Eosinophilia (higher in patients with symptoms) and raised serum IgE levels were found in nearly all patients and were strongly marked in approximately 66%. A positive correlation was observed between these 2 parameters. Fluorescent antibody levels (adult filaria Dipetalonema viteae antigen) were comparatively low in patients with microfilaremia.\r"

We compared 2 long-term residential groups with high and low exposure to malaria. The seropositive rate to the peptides was significantly higher with increased exposure. There was no significant difference in response rates to the Pf155/RESA. This may indicate the level of persistent T cell memory in previously primed donors. The seropositive rates to 3 Pf155/RESA peptides and the rates measured by either 3H-thymidine incorporation or IFN-gamma release after stimulation with Pf155/RESA and the peptides were all lower in parasite positive individuals. Even low grade, asymptomatic parasitemia can impair the T cell response in vitro. The lower antibody response in parasite positive subjects may be explained by either antibody consumption or lower protection against malaria parasitemia in subjects with low concentrations of antibodies against the Pf155/RESA antigen.\r"

The capability of the EC-FP5 cells to be cultured in large amounts and cryopreserved in several aliquots will provide flexibility, reduce experimental variation, and enhance the utility of the endothelial cell-dependent cytoadherence assay.\r"

Infected volunteers included persons previously given diethylcarbamazine citrate for 12 consecutive days and some that were untreated. Mosquitoes, derived from field-collected larvae, were released under bed nets and fed upon the volunteers while they slept. The mean mf uptake in mosquitoes that fed on 21 carriers with low to ultralow densities (1-28 mf/ml blood) was 0.2-4 mf/mosquito (mean = 1.7 mf). The observed infectivity rate of greater than 3,000 mosquitoes that fed on high (56-7,500 mf/ml blood; median = 525), low (11-49 mf/ml blood; median = 20), or ultralow (1-10 mf/ml blood; median = 3) density carriers was 4, 11, and 30 times higher, respectively, than the expected rate calculated from the estimated volume of the imbibed bloodmeal. These results indicate that \"hidden\" carriers (less than 50 mf/ml blood) may serve as a source of infection for mosquitoes, and support the increasing evidence that mosquitoes ingest more microfilariae than expected.\r"

Numerous clinical trials have shown that ivermectin is safe and effective in the treatment of human infection with Onchocerca volvulus. Although it is rapidly microfilaricidal, it does not cause a severe reaction, as is seen with diethylcarbamazine treatment. The drug temporarily interrupts production of microfilaria but has not known long-lasting effects on the adult worms. In patients with onchocerciasis, a single oral dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg) repeated once a year leads to a marked reduction in skin microfilaria counts and ocular involvement. At this dose, ivermectin causes minimal side effects and is sufficiently free of severe reactions to be used on a mass scale. It promises to revolutionize the treatment of onchocerciasis.\r"

  ".W": "Several investigators have shown that alcohol can suppress the production of antibodies by animals and humans. The studies reported here were designed to determine whether alcohol has a direct effect on the B-lymphocyte and to determine which stage of the B-cell response is inhibited by alcohol. B-lymphocyte lines specific for the antigen dinitrophenyl were used to study the effect of alcohol on the B-lymphocyte. As little as 100 mg% of alcohol inhibited the response of these pure B-cell lines to stimulation by either antigen (dinitrophenyl-Ficoll) or anti-mu antibody. Since no other cell types were present in the system the suppressive effect was on the B-cell itself. However, alcohol did not inhibit membrane depolarization induced by antigen crosslinking of immunoglobulin receptors, and it did not inhibit activation of the phosphatidyl inositol pathway by receptor crosslinking. When alcohol was added to antigen stimulated B-lymphocyte lines for varying periods during the immune response it was found that antibody production was inhibited if 150 mg% alcohol was present from 30 to 48 hr after the antigen was added to lymphocytes. Thirty-six to 48 hr is the time required for a stimulated mature B-lymphocyte to enter the proliferative phase of the immune response. These data raise the possibility that low doses of alcohol can inhibit antigen-induced B-cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol is a known suppressant to the immune system, and alcoholics frequently have impaired humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Several studies indicate that alcohol modulates natural killer (NK) cell activity. NK cells provide important defense against certain infectious diseases, spontaneously arising tumors and, in particular, to blood-borne metastasizing tumor cells. Evaluation of the effects of alcohol on NK cells is complicated by many factors including: the level and duration of alcohol abuse, polydrug use, the subject's age, and nutritional and health status. This study examined the effects of 1 and 2 weeks of alcohol consumption on baseline and interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulated murine NK cell activity. Well nourished female C57BL/6 mice were given continuous access to 20% w/v ethanol as the sole fluid source and consumed about 40% of their total caloric intake as ethanol. Splenic baseline and IL-2 stimulated NK cell activity were significantly lower in ethanol-consuming groups compared to control groups after the 1- and 2-week test periods. The average daily intake of ethanol, blood alcohol concentration, and the percentage of ethanol-derived calories were not associated with the decreased NK cell activity of the experimental animals; nor did any other measured parameter appear to serve as an indicator of ethanol modulation of splenic NK cell activity. Whether this immunosuppression results from the \"direct\" modulation of ethanol or from indirect factors is presently unknown.\r"

These changes in cell surface levels reflect increased intracellular protein synthesis and increased steady state mRNA levels. The effective ethanol concentrations (0.1-1.0%) are physiologically attainable. Measurement of class I MHC antigens on peripheral blood lymphocytes in a population of acutely ethanol-intoxicated patients showed a highly significant increase relative to controls. The possibility that the elevated levels of MHC antigens induced by ethanol may play a role in the evolution of ethanol-related disease is discussed.\r"

To investigate the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the immune system, we used a mouse model of FAS in which C57BL/6J female mice were fed a complete liquid diet containing 25% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) from gestational day (g.d.) 1 to 18. Thymus cell numbers were markedly reduced in 18-day fetuses exposed to ethanol. Thymocytes from fetuses from the 25% EDC diet group and from pair-fed and ad-libitum control diet groups were compared by flow cytometry for expression of T cell differentiation antigens. The proportions of L3T4- and Lyt-2 positive thymus cells were significantly reduced in alcohol-exposed fetuses compared to controls; however, the number of Thy-1-positive cells did not differ among any of the groups. Six-day old neonates exposed prenatally to ethanol from g.d. 1 to 13 had thymus and spleen T cell populations similar to those of controls in almost all cases, indicating a \"catch-up\" of T cell numbers in most animals. Spleen T cell function, assessed by response to Concanavalin A (Con A), or Con A plus T cell growth factors, was somewhat depressed in ethanol-exposed 6-day pups.\r"

By using a rat model of ethanol intoxication we have described a defect in lymphocyte proliferation to concanavalin A. In the current report data, preliminary and definitive, are presented that show our approach to determining the mechanisms of ethanol-associated impairments in the immune system, especially the defect in lymphocyte proliferation. We have found that purified thymus-derived lymphocytes from the spleens of ethanol-treated rats have an inherent defect in their response to mitogenic stimulation. This defect is not caused by the direct effects of ethanol on the cells and probably is not caused by an inability of the cells from ethanol-treated animals to produce the lymphocyte growth factor interleukin 2. Data are also presented that indicate that corticosteroids, produced most abundantly in this model by withdrawal from ethanol, play a role in the down-regulation of the response of spleen cells to mitogenic stimulation.\r"

The aim of the project is to reach women in an early stage of alcohol dependence behavior and to develop treatment programs specific to the needs of females alone. In order to investigate the value of such a specialized female unit a controlled 2-year follow-up study was carried out including 200 women. The probands were treated in the female only EWA-unit, whereas the controls were placed in the care of traditional mixed-sex alcoholism treatment centers. The 2-year follow-up study showed a more successful rehabilitation regarding alcohol consumption and social adjustment for the women treated in the specialized female unit (EWA). Improvement was noted also for the controls but to a lesser extent. Probably one of the most important achievements of a specialized female unit, such as EWA, is to attract women to come for help earlier.\r"

With age-controlled, lifetime consumption, and impairment on performance in the cognitive test (a Category Sorting Test) correlated positively with T1 whole brain and in selected regions. Impairment in the cognitive test correlated with increased T1 in whole brain and white matter independently of cerebral atrophy. Alcohol consumption patterns in the following 6 months were unrelated to changes in T1. The excess water implied by the elevated T1 values may be intra- or extracellular. It is uncertain whether or not T1 elevation in alcoholics is a marker of neuronal damage. T1 elevation appears to be a marker of one type of alcohol-related cognitive impairment.\r"

During weekend (48 hr) heavy drinking (5.5 g of alcohol per kg b.w.) no significant changes were seen in mean serum dolichol concentrations in 10 healthy, nonalcoholic volunteers. Neither did moderate drinking for 10 days (60 g of alcohol daily)--preceded and followed by a period of abstinence--produce any significant changes in serum dolichol levels in 10 nonalcoholic subjects. During detoxification treatment of 12 alcoholics, mean serum dolichol concentration stayed constant for the first 7 days; on entering treatment it was 227.7 +/- 15.0 ng/ml, on the 3rd day 238.5 +/- 15.9 ng/ml, and on the 7th day of treatment 222.6 +/- 18.6 ng/ml. Our results show that as well as increasing urinary dolichol excretion, chronic alcohol abuse also produces increased serum dolichol concentrations. However, contrary to urinary dolichols, serum dolichol levels do not react significantly to heavy drinking lasting for 48 hr in nonalcoholic volunteers. Furthermore in alcoholics increased serum dolichol concentrations do not decrease as rapidly during abstinence as urinary dolichol concentrations do.\r"

These results were compared with the hepatic activities of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase. After intragastric administration of 3 g/kg body weight of ethanol, ethanol concentrations were much higher in suckling rats than in adult animals, especially at 90, 120, and 180 min after its administration. In addition, acetaldehyde concentrations were undetectable in suckling rats as opposed to adult rats, in whom micromolar concentrations were detected. Thus, 5- to 30-day-old rats seem to have a limited capacity for in vivo ethanol metabolism. The analysis of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity revealed that it was very low at birth and it increased progressively with time attaining adult levels after 20 days of life. The alcohol dehydrogenase activity present in the liver of suckling rats presented similar Km values and sensitivity to pyrazole as adult rat liver. Thus, the pattern of in vivo ethanol elimination during the suckling period is not explained by hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Whether that diminished ethanol metabolism is due to slower intestinal ethanol absorption, different ethanol distribution in the body, or diminished hepatic capacity for NADH reoxidation remains to be studied. At birth, hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was low and it increased reaching adult levels during the suckling period. Adult levels for the component of low Km were attained earlier than for the component of high Km. The low affinity hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase component in the newborn was different from that in the adult as assessed by kinetic studies and by its sensitivity to disulfiram.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A fourth group received lab chow and water ad libitum to assess the role of paternal undernutrition associated with alcohol consumption. After three or four weeks of diet consumption, these males were bred to females of the same strain. Pregnant females were divided into similarly treated alcohol groups and were fed these diets beginning on gestation Day 8, thus creating a factorial study with strain, paternal, and maternal alcohol consumption as main factors. Paternal alcohol consumption was associated with decreased litter size, decreased testosterone levels, and a strain-related effect on offspring activity. Offspring activity decreased for those sired by 35% and 17.5% EDC Long-Evans fathers. Activity also decreased for offspring sired by 17.5% EDC Sprague-Dawley fathers but increased for those sired by 35% EDC fathers. Paternal alcohol consumption did not affect postnatal mortality or passive avoidance learning of offspring. Maternal alcohol consumption was associated with lower birth weights, lower offspring weights at weaning, increased postnatal mortality, and poorer passive avoidance learning. However, offspring activity was not affected. In a separate study, levels of alcohol in the testes were found to be somewhat, but not significantly, lower than blood alcohol levels. DNA taken from sperm of Long-Evans males consuming alcohol, migrated farther under pulsed field electrophoresis than DNA from control fathers, suggestive of an alcohol-related effect on sperm DNA.\r"

Only phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus was significantly depressed after alcohol ingestion. Adherence was inhibited only in some individuals when their respective blood alcohol levels were the highest. Both alterations were moderate and reversible. These data point out the limited effect of occasional alcohol consumption on the different facets of neutrophil behavior. These findings suggest that factors other than alcohol itself could be concerned in the marked PMN dysfunction well established in chronic alcoholism.\r"

Control rats were given distilled water in the same volume by the same route or were given no intragastric fluids. After administration of Valium-Hypnorm anesthesia, parotid salivary secretion was stimulated by subcutaneous pilocarpine HCI (10 mg/kg), and accurately timed samples were collected. No differences were recorded in the rate of salivary flow during the initial (5-min) high-flow phase of secretion, but during the subsequent 25-min phase of secretion the output in ethanol-treated rats was depressed by 60% compared to controls (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, electrolyte analyses of this saliva indicated that salivary ductal resorptive activity might be diminished in the presence of high blood ethanol. However, when rats were previously habitually exposed to ethanol at a twice daily dose of 4 ml of 35% (v/v) ethanol in water, the inhibitory action of acute ethanol administration was abolished. Moreover, in these rats there was significantly depressed [Na+] in both high-flow and low-flow saliva samples (p less than 0.01) with little change in [Na+] occurring at higher flow rates. This suggests the possibility of enhanced ductal resorption developing in rats exposed to long-term ethanol feeding.\r"

The effect of stress on the content of beta-EP in the serum, pituitary gland and hypothalamus, as well as on the serum corticosterone and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) content was examined. Pups prenatally exposed to ethanol had significantly higher serum beta-EP levels on Day 1 and higher serum corticosterone levels on Days 1-3 when compared to their pair-fed or basic controls. On all days tested pituitary beta-EP content was lower in the offspring of the ethanol-treated rats than in the control groups. There was no difference in the total hypothalamic beta-EP content between the three treatment groups; however, during the first 10 days of life a higher concentration (ng/mg protein) of beta-EP was observed in the hypothalami of the ethanol and the pair-fed group when compared to the basic control pups. Hypothalamic CRF levels, though significantly lower in the pups exposed to ethanol in utero than in the control groups on Day 3, increased significantly in the ethanol group between Days 14 and 22, while no significant change was observed during this period in either of the control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and fifteen human male subjects, 19-30 years of age, received ethanol orally as vodka (0.55, 0.7, or 0.85 g/kg) followed by a second drink (0.3-0.4 g/kg) given 3-4 hr later. After both doses, blood ethanol levels reached approximately 100 mg/dl. Breath samples were taken every 20-30 min and rates of ethanol elimination were determined. In addition to the design described above, 100 subjects received 0.7 g/kg ethanol in two separate visits to the laboratory. In a third experimental design, ethanol was given i.v. to 12 subjects. With the single-day experimental design, the frequency distribution of changes in rates of ethanol elimination between the first compared with the second administration of ethanol was not unimodal. Up to 20% of the subjects demonstrated rates more than 40% greater than basal values in response to ethanol. Based on these findings in humans, a Swift Increase in Alcohol Metabolism (SIAM) was defined as an increase in the rate of ethanol elimination of at least 40% over the basal rate. Under these conditions, the frequency of SIAM was dose dependent (studied with 0.55, 0.7, and 0.85 g/kg); nearly 20% of the subjects demonstrated SIAM with a dose of ethanol of 0.85 g/kg. In the two-day experimental design, a SIAM response was also observed in about 10% of 49 well-fed subjects; however, none of 51 subjects tested exhibited a SIAM response following an overnight fast. In addition, a rapid and transient SIAM reflecting a 60% increase in the rate of ethanol elimination above basal values was observed when ethanol was given continuously for 5 hr i.v.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report summarizes the results of a series of studies that examined the effects of alcohol on the acoustic-phonetic properties of speech. Audio recordings were made of male talkers producing lists of sentences under a sober condition and an intoxicated condition. These speech samples were then subjected to perceptual and acoustic analyses. In one perceptual experiment, listeners heard matched pairs of sentences from four talkers and were required to identify the sentence that was produced while the talker was intoxicated. In a second perceptual experiment, Indiana State Troopers and college undergraduates were required to judge whether individual sentences presented in isolation were produced in a sober or an intoxicated condition. The results of the perceptual experiments indicated that groups of listeners can significantly discriminate between speech samples produced under sober and intoxicated conditions. For acoustic analyses, digital signal processing techniques were used to measure acoustic-phonetic changes that took place in speech production when the talker was intoxicated. The results of the acoustical analyses revealed consistent and well-defined changes in speech articulation between sober and intoxicated conditions. Because speech production requires fine motor control and timing of the articulators, it may be possible to use acoustic-phonetic measures as sensitive indices of sensory-motor impairment due to alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".U": "90024224\r", 
  ".W": "The long-term consequences of prenatal ethanol exposure on histochemically detectable hippocampal mossy fiber zinc was examined using a recently developed quantitative histofluorescence procedure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained throughout gestation on one of three dietary regimens: (a) a liquid diet containing either 3.35% ethanol, (b) an isocalorically matched liquid diet pair-fed to the 3.35% ethanol group, or (c) lab chow ad libitum. At 45 days of age, offspring from each of the three diet groups were sacrificed for determination of hippocampal mossy fiber zinc and zinc analysis of selected tissues by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Hippocampal mossy fiber zinc was reduced by 36% in dorsal and 20% in ventral hippocampal formation stratum lucidum of rats exposed to the 3.35% ethanol diet compared to the offspring of the pair-fed control and ad libitum control dams. No significant differences in zinc:TS-Q histofluorescence were observed between the ad libitum and pair-fed control groups. No significant differences were observed among groups in tissue wet weight or tissue zinc concentration in any of the brain or other body regions analyzed. These results indicate a long lasting prenatal ethanol exposure-induced reduction in hippocampal mossy fiber zinc in the absence of changes in any indices of total body zinc nutriture. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to relatively low blood ethanol levels (30-40 mg/dl) has subtle, yet long-lasting effects in the hippocampal formation, a brain region important in the process of memory consolidation.\r"

The volunteers were all healthy men. They were familiarized with the central nervous system (CNS) toxic effects of local anesthetics by receiving a preliminary intravenous injection of lidocaine. The infusions of ropivacaine and bupivacaine were given not less than 7 days apart. CNS toxicity was identified by the CNS symptoms and the volunteers were told to request that the infusion be stopped when they felt definite but not severe symptoms of toxicity such as numbness of the mouth, lightheadedness, and tinnitus. In the absence of definite symptoms, the infusion was stopped after 150 mg had been given. Cardiovascular system (CVS) changes in conductivity and myocardial contractility were monitored using an interpretive electrocardiograph (which measured PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval corrected for heart rate) and echocardiography (which measured left ventricular dimensions from which stroke volume and ejection fraction were calculated). Ropivacaine caused less CNS symptoms and was at least 25% less toxic than bupivacaine in regard to the dose tolerated. Both drugs increased heart rate and arterial pressure. Stroke volume and ejection fraction were reduced. There was no change in cardiac output. Although both drugs caused evidence of depression of conductivity and contractility, these appeared at lower dosage and lower plasma concentrations with bupivacaine than with ropivacaine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of an intrathecally administered A1 adenosine agonist: N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (LPIA) or an A2 adenosine agonist: 5'-(N-ethyl carboxamido)-adenosine (NECA), on this touch-evoked hyperesthesia were examined. Over the range of 0.3-1.0 nmol these agents produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the strychnine-evoked hyperesthesia. This inhibition was reversed following intraperitoneal injection of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist. No statistical differences between LPIA and NECA were recorded. The powerful effect of adenosine analogues on strychnine hyperesthesia occur at doses that have only a mild analgesic effect on the thermally evoked hot-plate response. This effect is in contrast to opioids, which have been reported to be only minimally effective against strychnine-evoked hyperesthesia. The characteristics of the strychnine hyperesthesia appear to mimic the clinical phenomenon observed in patients suffering from sensory dysesthesia following nerve injury and suggest a possible role for the adenosine receptor in certain pain states.\r"

It is produced by dysfunction of the long thoracic nerve and consequent paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle. A survey of senior anesthesiologists indicated a consistent lack of familiarity with the entity. This article presents six cases of postoperative long thoracic nerve palsy. In a literature review of 111 instances of long thoracic nerve palsy, 51 were trauma-related, 47 were either idiopathic or of debatable origin, and 13 appeared following a surgical or obstetrical procedure. Unprovable etiologic contentions were frequent. Considerations of the etiologies of postoperative long thoracic nerve palsies must include a coincidental infectious neuropathy (\"neuralgic amyotrophy\") as a valid alternative to the assertion that a preventable injury occurred during anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred healthy parturients were divided at random into two demographically similar groups and were positioned for cesarean section either horizontally or flexed 5 to 10 degrees head up, with a 15 degrees lateral tilt. A Doppler ultrasound transducer was positioned over the fourth intercostal space parasternally. Initially, two patients received spinal, three general, and 95 epidural anesthesia. Two patients subsequently needed general for failed epidural anesthesia. Changes in Doppler heart tones (greater than 15 sec duration) indicative of venous air embolism (VAE) were identified 15 times in 11 patients--seven in supine and four in head-up patients (no statistically significant difference). Six awake patients (three horizontal, three head-up) developed chest tightness or pain during surgery, but only one episode correlated with VAE. No patient developed breathlessness. Moderate hypotension (greater than 10% decrease in systolic arterial pressure [SAP]) occurred in seven of 11 (63.6%) patients with, and in 26 (29.2%) of 89 patients without, VAE (P less than 0.001). More severe hypotension (SAP less than 90 mm Hg) due to bleeding occurred once. We conclude that a modest (5-10 degrees) head-up position does not influence the occurrence of VAE in patients having cesarean section. An 11% incidence of clinically insignificant VAE, although low, is still worrisome, as even small air bubbles in the circulation are potentially harmful, especially if the foramen ovale is patent. VAE during cesarean section should be anticipated and the anesthetic management planned accordingly.\r"

The reflex nearly doubles aortic pressure within 4-6 sec and is associated with powerful inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic responses. The afferent pathway is via intrathoracic vagal branches, whereas the efferent paths engage not only the vagal and sympathetic routes but also the phrenic nerve. The reflex can be abolished by vagotomy or with cyproheptadine, and can be attenuated by local anesthesia of the intertruncal space. Small chemoreceptors lying between the aorta and pulmonary artery are the source of the reflex, and they receive their blood supply from the proximal left coronary artery. Human counterparts of the reflex may include new hypertension during angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction, new postoperative hypertension after coronary bypass grafting, and hypertensive patients with carcinoid syndrome. Many unresolved problems include the precise mechanism of chemoreception, whether the chemoreflex has any tonic influence, and mechanisms of integration of the reflex with other events peripherally and centrally. Answers to these questions could be of great clinical value.\r"

One hundred fifty adult outpatients were randomly assigned to one of six study groups according to a double-blind protocol design. Patients were given placebo (saline) or midazolam (5 mg im) 30-60 min prior to surgery, and then either placebo, oxymorphone (1 mg iv), or fentanyl (100 micrograms iv) 3-5 min prior to a standardized anesthetic technique. Preoperatively, midazolam premedication was associated with a significantly lower anxiety level (37 +/- 29 mm vs. 50 +/- 32 mm, P less than 0.05), higher sedation level (254 +/- 136 mm vs. 145 +/- 109 mm, P less than 0.01), worsening of psychomotor skill (5 +/- 5 vs. 2 +/- 2 dots missed, P less than 0.01; midazolam vs. placebo), and impaired recall abilities. In addition, use of midazolam did not prolong the discharge time. Compared to control patients, those who received fentanyl had a decreased incidence of intraoperative airway difficulties such as coughing (28% vs. 0%, P less than 0.01). Although use of opioids increased the incidence of postoperative nausea (42% vs. 18%, P less than 0.01) and vomiting (23% vs. 2%, P less than 0.01; opioid vs. no opioid), average recovery times were not affected by opioid administration. Oxymorphone use was associated with a lower incidence of pain at home compared with that following fentanyl (46% vs. 74%, P less than 0.05). Finally, preoperative administration of both midazolam and fentanyl or oxymorphone prior to a standardized methohexital-nitrous oxide anesthetic technique did not adversely affect recovery after outpatient surgery.\r"

All patients were operated upon during epidural anesthesia with 2% lidocaine and 1:200,000 epinephrine to achieve a T4 sensory level. Upon first complaint of pain in the recovery room, patients were given a titrated iv loading dose of the assigned opioid until comfortable and were then provided with a programmable PCA device. Group I (PCA) consisted of two subsets in which incremental boluses of morphine (1.8 mg, n = 16) or oxymorphone (0.3 mg, n = 16) could be self-administered via conventional PCA. Patients in group II (PCA + BI) received a basal infusion of morphine (0.6 mg/hour, n = 16) or oxymorphone (0.1 mg/hour, n = 16) in addition to self-administered boluses of 1.8 and 0.3 mg, respectively. Patients were evaluated for 24 h following initiation of analgesic therapy, and 10-cm visual analog scales (VAS) were utilized at selected intervals to assess pain at rest, pain during movement, and satisfaction with therapy. The level of sedation and incidence of nausea/vomiting and pruritus were also recorded. Patients utilizing PCA + BI noted significant reductions in resting pain scores with oxymorphone and decreased pain during movement with both opioids when compared with individuals using PCA alone (P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in 24-h dose requirements or patient satisfaction with therapy (P = ns).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to evaluate the myocardial protective effect of nicardipine (NIC) in patients with normal left ventricular (LV) function (control vs. NIC treatment group) and impaired LV function (control vs. NIC treatment group) during extracorporeal circulation for coronary artery surgery. NIC infusions were begun approximately 12 min before aortic cross clamping (AoX) at an infusion rate of 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and maintained for 10 min. Prior to AoX an additional bolus of NIC 5 mg was given. Coronary hemodynamics, myocardial metabolic parameters (continuous thermodilution), and regional LV function (two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography) were measured. At 15 min after discontinuation of AoX, lactate production was found in the two control groups but not in the two NIC treatment groups. In the control groups, lactate production returned to extraction at sternal closure. At that time regional area ejection fraction (RAEF) had significantly improved in both groups with impaired LV function compared with postintubation (baseline) values. In NIC-treated patients with impaired LV function, however, the percentage improvement in RAEF was significantly greater than that in the control groups. Between the groups, there were no differences in the number of patients requiring inotropic support, pacing, and/or diuretics after bypass or postoperatively. There were no significant differences in postoperative creatine kinase myocardial band release or in the incidence of dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or mortality. The results of the present study suggest that NIC iv may be used to provide additional myocardial protection during extracorporeal circulation. In addition, in NIC-treated patients with compromised LV function, this may be associated with a more apparent improvement in RAEF than that seen in nontreated patients.\r"

Preservative-free saline was added to 0, 2.5, 5, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 37.5, or 50 micrograms fentanyl to make a 1 ml total volume, which was injected intrathecally prior to bupivacaine in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Vital signs, sensory level, motor block, pain score, and side effects were recorded every 2 min for the first 12 min and then at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and at 30-min intervals until the patient complained of pain. At delivery maternal vein, umbilical artery, and umbilical vein blood gases were obtained. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were recorded. Early Neonatal Neurobehavioral Scales (ENNS) were performed on days 1 and 2. Side effects and opioid requirements were recorded for the first 24 h. All of the patients in the control group reported a pain score greater than 0 during surgery and 67% required intraoperative opioids. None of the patients who received greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms fentanyl required intraoperative opioids. Complete analgesia (time from injection to first report of pain) lasted 33.7 +/- 30.8 min (mean +/- SD) in the control group and increased to 130 +/- 30 min (P less than 0.05) with addition of 6.25 micrograms fentanyl. Duration of effective analgesia (time from injection to first parenteral opioid) was 71.8 +/- 43.2 min in the control group and increased (P less than 0.05) to 192 +/- 74.9 min with addition of 6.25 micrograms fentanyl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind, crossover study was designed to evaluate the effect of L-carnitine on the reactive hyperemia in patients with peripheral vascular disease. After drug washout, 18 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or L-carnitine, 3 g IV as a bolus, followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 2 mg/kg/min for thirty minutes. Blood flow in the affected limb was measured by impedance plethysmography, under resting conditions and every two minutes for ten minutes after a five-minute ischemia induced in the affected limb. As compared with placebo, L-carnitine did not modify blood flow at rest. On the contrary, the hyperemic response with carnitine was higher than that observed with placebo. A significant increase in blood flow was found two, four, and six minutes after the release of ischemia with placebo, whereas the blood perfusion to the affected limb rose significantly at all times of recording after carnitine administration. Moreover, the values of the blood flow at two and ten minutes with carnitine were significantly higher than those recorded after placebo at the same times of recording. After the release of ischemia, the mean maximum value of blood flow observed after carnitine was 3.1 +/- 1.4 mL/min/100 mL, a value significantly higher than that recorded after placebo, which was 2.7 +/- 1.3 mL/min/100 mL (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that L-carnitine, although not affecting blood flow and ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio under resting conditions, improves the functional circulatory reserve in patients with peripheral vascular disease.\r"

Forty patients with a history of claudication for at least six months were admitted to the study and were given either 3 x 300 mg tablets of picotamide (20 subjects) or three identical placebo tablets (20 subjects) for six months. The two groups of patients were similar in regard to clinical features and potential risk factors. At the end of treatment painfree walking distance and systolic ankle-arm pressure ratio improved more in the picotamide than in the placebo group (p = 0.05). Systolic ankle pressure curves, determined before and after the six-month treatment, showed a positive trend to a higher postexercise ankle pressure and a faster return to the preexercise levels in the picotamide group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Laboratory monitoring revealed a slight prolongation of bleeding time, a significant decrease in arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation, and an enhanced fibrinolysis with absence of interference with hemostasis in the picotamide group. One patient in the placebo group developed a major cardiovascular event (angina pectoris) during the study. These results indicate that picotamide is an effective drug that may modify the natural course of intermittent claudication and associated vascular problems.\r"

Other cytokines not discussed including some of the colony stimulating factors, tumor necrosis factor and the interferons have also been used in clinical trials. Undoubtedly as we learn more about interleukins IL-1 through IL-7, clinical applications will become apparent. For the allergist/immunologist there are two areas of greatest potential interest. The first of these is in treating immunodeficiency states. Preliminary studies of the use of IL-2 in patients with T cell dysfunction suggest that this substance may be useful in treating selective T cell disorders. IL-4, 5, and 6 all have some influence on B cell function. It is likely that in the near future one or more of these agents will be used clinically. It is also clear that the interleukins have the potential to influence basic mechanisms known to be important in allergic disease. IL-3 is the major factor influencing mast cell growth. IL-4 among other things, promotes B cells to switch to IgE synthesis as well as to induce Fc epsilon RII receptors on B cells. IL-5 is important in the differentiation and growth of eosinophils. Finally, IL-6 is the terminal differentiation factor that causes B cells to become plasma cells. The next few years should result in an even better understanding of the role of each of these interleukins. It is likely that such information will greatly expand the horizons for understanding the pathogenesis of many immunologically mediated diseases and will provide the basis for new modalities of treatment.\r"

The efficiency and ease of placement of skin staplers make them an attractive alternative to suture repair of selected lacerations in the emergency department. Emergency physicians, however, have been reluctant to use staplers in the ED. We evaluated skin staples in 76 patients presenting with 87 lacerations to the scalp, trunk, or extremities, excluding hands and feet. Patients returned to the ED in two and seven to ten day for wound check and staple removal. Skin stapling was assessed for efficiency, cosmetic results, complications, and cost-effectiveness. Only one significant complication was noted in our study group - a dehiscence of a scalp laceration secondary to hematoma collection. There was also a minor dehiscence of a superficial laceration of the leg due to inadequate primary closure, which did not result in any cosmetic deformity. No infectious complications, delayed wound healing, or cosmetic problems were seen. Skin stapling was easier and quicker than suture repair at a lower overall cost in most circumstances. Our study shows skin stapling to be an efficient and cost-effective alternative method to suture wound closure for selected lacerations in patients presenting to the ED, without compromising wound healing or cosmetic results.\r"

Lymphocyte responses to PPD, Candida, and streptokinase were measured at birth and at intervals later. The mean response of paired values from 26 infants without BCG vaccination rose for the PPD stimulation index (SI) from 2.7 at birth to 3.9 before 2 yr of age. The SI for both Candida and streptokinase for this group of infants rose significantly in the first 2 yr (p less than 0.05). In 66 infants who received BCG in the first 7 days of life, the PPD-SI rose from 3.1 to 35.3 (p less than 0.001). In 17 infants who received the vaccine later but before 9 months, it rose from 3.1 at birth to 24.9, and in 14 who received it between 9 months and 2 yr, it rose from 2.2 to 52.9. The lymphocyte responses to PPD after BCG in these two groups were significantly different (p less than 0.05). There was no evidence in the older infants that a raised PPD-SI before BCG vaccination affected lymphocyte sensitization by the vaccine. We conclude that increasing the age at vaccination with BCG from birth to more than 9 months enhances immunologic sensitization to PPD significantly in this population.\r"

Each photomicrograph was randomly graded with respect to the presence and extent of plexus formation, the presence of arborized loops, and the presence of splayed loops. Comparison of the plexus score, presence of arborized loops, and presence of splayed loops were significantly different between the clubbed and nonclubbed groups (p less than 0.001 in all three analyses). Only a plexus score of 2 or greater demonstrated a useful degree of sensitivity and specificity (89 and 90%, respectively).

Elastin is currently thought to play a pivotal role in the alveolarization of the lung by providing the structural framework around which new alveoli will develop. Previous studies in both the rat and the human neonate have demonstrated a risk for proteolytic destruction of lung elastin associated with prolonged hyperoxic exposure. The present study was undertaken to determine whether continuous exposure to 100% oxygen during the period of alveolar development in the rat (Days 4 to 13) would alter lung elastin. Parenchymal lung elastic fiber length, volume density of parenchyma, mean linear intercept, and internal surface area were quantitated using morphometric techniques, and the values were compared in control, oxygen-exposed, and malnourished rat pups. Stereologic measurements indicated that total elastic fiber length was significantly greater in lungs of control pups than in lungs of either the oxygen-exposed or the malnourished pups. Examination of sections of lung tissue 20 to 30 microns thick indicated altered elastic fiber structure and numerous alveolar fenestrae only in the hyperoxic pups. The results of these studies demonstrated that hyperoxic exposure during alveolarization alters both total length and structure of lung elastic fibers and suggest that impaired lung development might be due in part to these observed changes.\r"

  ".W": "Embryonic blood vessels develop in two ways: angiogenesis, which is growth by budding, branching, and elongation of existing vessels, and in situ formation of endothelial vesicles that coalesce with elongating vessels. It is assumed that the former is more prevalent, with the latter restricted to vessels that form near the endoderm:mesoderm interface. Neither the relative contributions of each of these processes in the formation of specific blood vessels nor the origins of precursors (angioblasts) of these intraembryonic endothelial populations are known. Antibodies that recognize quail endothelial cells can be used to follow the movements and differentiation of endothelial cell precursors after the transplantation of putative precursor populations from quail into chick embryos. Using this method, it has been shown that all intraembryonic mesodermal tissues, except the prechordal plate, contain angiogenic precursors. After transplantation some angioblasts move in all directions away from the site of implantation, invading surrounding mesenchyme and contributing to the formation of arteries, veins, and capillaries in a wide area. Although it is clear that these invasive angioblasts, which behave unlike any other embryonic mesenchymal cell type, are found throughout the embryo, it is not known whether they represent a unique endothelial cell type in mature blood vessels. Irrespective of their original location in the donor embryo, transplanted angioblasts will form vascular channels that are appropriate for the tissues surrounding their site of implantation. These results indicate that the control over vascular assembly resides within the connective-tissue-forming mesenchyme of the embryo.\r"

Over time, this gel is invaded by macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and undergoes \"organization,\" such that it is replaced by vascularized granulation tissue and finally by mature connective tissue. This sequence of events is not unique to tumors but occurs in wound-healing and in a wide variety of other disease processes, including some that prominently affect the lung.\r"

Results of this research indicate the potential role of the macrophage as one possible mediator of pulmonary hypertension. The macrophage has been shown to produce numerous soluble mediators, including various growth factors, some of which may be involved in the cellular proliferation of the arterial wall. Most of the knowledge regarding oxygen microenvironments, macrophages, and growth factor production comes from research on the healing wound. A considerable amount of what has been learned about the role of the macrophage in cutaneous wound healing may have direct applicability to macrophage function in acute lung injury and repair, and pulmonary hypertension. Macrophages play a pivotal role in cutaneous wound repair. They participate in immunologic and nonspecific host defense responses and produce numerous growth factors that regulate mesenchymal cell proliferation, migration, and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. These same responses are probably at work during the progression of pulmonary hypertension.\r"

In general, it is believed that receptor-phospholipase C interactions involve a guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein. This interaction can be inhibited by Bordetella pertussis toxin in certain cells. Here we report that pertussis toxin catalyzes the [32P]ADP ribosylation of a Mr = 41,000 protein in human umbilical vein EC. However, prior EC treatment with pertussis toxin (250 ng/ml for 20 h) does not inhibit thrombin-induced Ca2+ flux or IP3 formation, despite markedly attenuating the radiolabeling of the Mr = 41,000 protein (less than 5% control). Treatment of digitonin-permeabilized human umbilical vein EC with GTP gamma S, a stable GTP analog, or AIF4-, but not with GDP beta S, stimulates IP3 accumulation. However, GDP beta S inhibits GTP gamma S-induced IP3 accumulation. Although thrombin alone is not very effective in elevating IP3 levels in permeabilized EC, thrombin and GTP gamma S act in a synergistic fashion to increase IP3 accumulation. Overall, these observations are interpreted to indicate that a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein is a key intermediate in the signaling pathway linking thrombin receptors to phospholipase C in human umbilical vein EC.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has profound effects on all cell types making up the vasculature, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and adventitial connective tissue. As such, it plays a prominent role not only in the physiologic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis characteristic of embryogenesis and inflammation and repair but also in vascular disorders such as the arterial thickening associated with pulmonary hypertension. The actions of TGF-beta on these vascular cells in vitro and in vivo are extremely complex. In vitro, TGF-beta inhibits both the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in monolayer culture, but it promotes organization of the cells into tubelike structures in three-dimensional culture in collagen gels. TGF-beta also increases synthesis of fibronectin and decreases secretion of proteases by both endothelial cells and fibroblasts; the resultant changes in matrix composition could mediate the effects of TGF-beta on both the growth and phenotype of these cells, and overexpression could contribute to fibrosis. TGF-beta also regulates the synthesis by endothelial cells of platelet-derived growth factor, which can stimulate growth of vascular smooth muscle cells. In vivo, TGF-beta stimulates neovascularization at local sites of injection and also is angiogenic when assayed in the rabbit cornea or on the chick chorioallantoic membrane. However, because angiogenesis involves the participation of many different cell types, effects of TGF-beta on inflammatory cells must also be considered. Thus, the ability of TGF-beta to chemoattractant macrophages and to increase expression by the cells of mRNAs for several growth factors known to act on endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts must also be considered.\r"

Therefore, we screened 100 consecutive stable outpatients for correct or incorrect inhaler use and then conducted a randomized trial of two methods to teach correct use. Patients were classified as correct or incorrect users with a modified metered-dose inhaler containing a thermistor that detected inspiration, inhaler activation, and the duration of breath-holding. Patients were classified as incorrect users if they failed to: (1) activate the inhaler once during inspiration, and/or (2) hold their breath at the end of inspiration. There were 38 correct users and 62 incorrect users. Incorrect users were randomized to one of two teaching protocols: (1) standardized verbal instruction alone, or (2) standardized verbal instruction plus an automatic visual signal during inspiration. Incorrect users were restudied 6 to 10 wk later to reassess technique. Both treatment protocols were equally effective in converting incorrect user. However, the verbal instruction alone required significantly less time than the instruction with the mechanical aid. For all subjects, the proportion using correct technique declined over time, particularly for incorrect users. We also examined a series of patient characteristics, obtained by questionnaire and spirometry, to determine whether they could be used in the clinical setting to identify incorrect users. By discriminant analysis, a group of four variables predicted correct metered-dose inhaler use: bronchodilator responsiveness, a history of additional about proper technique, verbal knowledge of the correct inhaler maneuvers, and the patient's perception of whether it is important to use an inhaler.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have used a short-acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, rimiterol hydrobromide, to allow a larger dose of allergen to be administered to previous single \"early allergen responders\" to investigate if an increased dose of allergen could induce a late asthmatic response (LAR) and whether this would influence the subsequent level of allergen-acquired nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Pretreatment with inhaled rimiterol hydrobromide 400 microgram enabled an increase in allergen dose inhaled by a geometric mean of 8.9-fold (range, 2 to 29.1) in eight atopic subjects with mild asthma who initially were classified as single early responders with a maximal fall in FEV 3 to 8 h after allergen challenge (Lmax) of less than 15% from baseline value. The magnitude of the early asthmatic response was similar to that obtained on the control day when allergen challenge was performed in the absence of rimiterol hydrobromide. Five subjects were converted to dual allergen responders with Lmax of greater than 15% from premedication baseline value. For the whole group, there was a significant increase in the magnitude of LAR whether calculated as Lmax (p less than 0.05) or as area under the FEV1 time response curve between 3 and 8 h postchallenge (p less than 0.01). The provocation concentrations of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) at 8 h postchallenge were significantly reduced on both days when compared with the corresponding prechallenge values (p less than 0.05 on control day, p less than 0.01 on rimiterol day). However, despite the increase in the magnitude of LAR on the rimiterol day, the reduction in postchallenge PC20 did not differ significantly from that occurring on the control day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is not known whether these hormones cause similar changes in airway smooth muscle, and therefore, this study examined airway responsiveness during the large hormonal changes of pregnancy and evaluated whether changes in responsiveness are associated with changes in (1) progesterone and estrogen and (2) the clinical severity of asthma. Twenty nonpregnant asthmatic women were assessed every 3 months until conception. In the 16 who conceived, assessments were repeated once during the second and third trimesters and 1 month after delivery. Data collected preconception and from those who did not conceive within 1 yr were used for control subjects. There was a 2-fold improvement in airway responsiveness during pregnancy from a preconception mean PC20 0.35 to 0.72 mg/ml during the second trimester and 0.58 mg/ml during the third (p = 0.03). Post-delivery responsiveness (0.48 mg/ml) was not significantly different from preconception. The improvements during pregnancy were greater than the 3 monthly fluctuations when not pregnant (p = 0.04) and were greatest in those who were most hyperresponsive initially (p = 0.01). There was an associated improvement in clinical asthma severity as indicated by a reduction in minimum medication requirements (p = 0.03) and this was not at the expense of good symptoms control; both symptoms and spirometry remained unchanged during pregnancy. Changes in responsiveness were not closely related to progesterone or estriol, suggesting that other nonhormonal factors may also contribute to the improvement during pregnancy and that the control of asthmatic airway smooth muscle may not be exactly the same as that of the myometrium and gut.\r"

We have applied an automated immunoassay for alpha-1-antitrypsin to plasma samples from 20,000 blood donors. Seven PI Z antitrypsin-deficient persons were identified and confirmed; this is more than twice the number predicted from previous estimates of the Z allele frequency in the St. Louis area. Five of the subjects were further evaluated. We anticipate that this assay, if utilized to screen large populations, could identify many alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficient persons for study of the natural history of lung and liver disease associated with the deficiency. These subjects would be potential candidates for early intervention strategies to prevent the development of lung disease. The surprisingly high prevalence of deficient persons indicates that direct screening is the best method for prevalence estimation of genetic disorders.\r"

To assess multiple organ damage, 125I-labeled albumin accumulation was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, lung, kidneys, liver, heart, adrenal glands, and spleen and expressed as a ratio of BAL fluid or tissue to 125I-labeled albumin plasma (albumin index: Al). Wet-to-dry lung weight (W/D) ratios were also measured. The methylxanthines were administered by a bolus injection followed by a continuous infusion. The seven experimental groups included: saline-control, AMPH-control, PTXF-control, E. coli septic-control, E. coli septic-AMPH high dose, E coli septic-AMPH low dose, and E. coli septic-PTXF. The AI of the BAL fluid and all examined organs significantly increased in the septic-control group compared to those in the saline-, AMPH-, and PTXF-control groups, In all septic-methylxanthine groups, the AI of the BAL fluid and all organs, except for the spleen, were significantly lower than those of the septic-control group. Compared to the saline-, AMPH-, and PTXF-control groups, the septic-control group revealed a significant increase in lung W/D ratios, whereas the septic-AMPH high and low dose groups and the septic-PTXF group did not. Of importance, the septic-PTXF group did not cause a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) as compared to the control groups, whereas the septic-AMPH groups did cause a significant decrease in MAP compared to the septic-control group. Therefore, the data from this experiment demonstrate that both AMPH and PTXF attenuate the multiple organ albumin leak seen in septic guinea pigs. However, PTXF exerted this protective effect with no discernible effect on the MAP whereas the MAP of AMPH-treated guinea pigs was significantly decreased.\r"

LSS is sensitive and specific for parenchymal irregularity in the liver and spleen. VA is sensitive and specific for vascular abnormality, severe hemorrhage, and arteriovenous shunting. None of these tests are completely sensitive and specific for the spectrum of surgically significant injuries produced by blunt abdominal trauma. In this group of patients who had multiple studies because of diagnostic uncertainty, DPL had the highest predictive value and the highest efficiency.

Three facts emerged from this study: 1) the amylase and lipase were overly sensitive, but not specific and had only a 10 per cent predictive value for ampullary obstruction; 2) the bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) were positive in patients with ampullary obstruction if they were postcholecystectomy but not so in patients with an intact gallbladder, which may be explained by the third observation; 3) the gallbladder can compensate for partial ampullary obstruction by dilatation five to ten times and by its ability to absorb 90 per cent of the water content of the bile. The Neostigmine Morphine Test is not a reliable screen for ampullary obstruction and positive findings must be confirmed by other studies.\r"

DESIGN: Synthesis and summarization of data on the untreated course of cerebrovascular disease, and review of selected evidence and expert opinion on the risks and benefits of endarterectomy and medical therapy. MAIN RESULTS: There is a large body of data related to the untreated course of cerebrovascular disease, the efficacy of aspirin in patients with transient ischemic attacks, and the comparative responsiveness to surgery of symptomatic patients with different presentations. Randomized trials in progress will increase the knowledge about the effects of aspirin in asymptomatic patients, the comparative efficacy of aspirin and endarterectomy in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and the factors that influence surgical risk. Clinicians and investigators wish to define a more limited and precise set of indications for carotid endarterectomy. In setting standards, attention has properly focussed on \"maximum acceptable complication rates,\" native stroke risk, and surgical efficacy for patients with different clinical presentations. Illustrative, acceptable surgical mortality rates are less than 1%, and stroke-related morbidity is less than 3% for patients who have had a transient ischemic attack; surgical mortality and stroke-related morbidity are less than 2% for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Medical comorbidity and angiographic findings are important factors affecting specific recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Data from ongoing clinical trials will provide a more scientific foundation for recommendations about when to do carotid endarterectomy. Current evidence suggests that fewer endarterectomies should be done, and those on the basis of a more precise set of indications. Clinicians should consider the clinical presentation, the patient's comorbidity and native stroke risk, angiographic findings, and the experience of the surgical team.\r"

To differentiate among non-ulcer dyspepsia, the irritable bowel syndrome, organic gastrointestinal disease, and health, we developed a self-report questionnaire. Our bowel disease questionnaire, which evaluated 46 symptom-related items was completed prospectively by 361 subjects before their clinical evaluation as outpatients. Of these subjects, 115 were categorized ultimately as having functional bowel disease (non-ulcer dyspepsia or the irritable bowel syndrome), 101 were categorized ultimately as having organic gastrointestinal disease, and 145 were healthy persons having routine periodic examinations for whom no additional diagnoses were made. All diagnoses were based on independent clinical evaluations, not on the patients' responses to the questionnaire. The bowel disease questionnaire was acceptable and easily completed; it elicited symptoms in a highly reliable manner and was shown to be a valid measure of functional bowel complaints. Our questionnaire discriminated non-ulcer dyspepsia from irritable bowel syndrome with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 72%, and it discriminated functional bowel disease from organic disease and health with sensitivities of 85% and 83%, and specificities of 60% and 76%, respectively. We believe that this questionnaire is an additional and useful diagnostic tool for identifying patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether in the previous National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) studies of node-negative breast cancer there were either cohorts of patients with a prognosis favorable enough to preclude using systemic therapy or subsets of patients who failed to benefit from the treatments. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trials with stratification after surgery. SETTING: NSABP trials at institutions in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Data were collected on 731 eligible patients (Protocol B-13) with estrogen-receptor-negative tumors who randomly received either no therapy after surgery or sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil (M----F) followed by leucovorin. Data were also collected on 2834 patients (Protocol B-14) with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors who randomly received either placebo or tamoxifen treatment. The percentage of patients surviving disease-free was determined through 4 years of follow-up using life-table estimates. INTERVENTIONS: Protocol B-13 patients received 12 courses of M----F given intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks. Leucovorin therapy was begun 24 hours after M----F administration. Protocol B-14 patients received 5-year treatment with either tamoxifen (10 mg twice daily by mouth) or placebo. RESULTS: When the outcome of untreated patients in either trial was related to the stratification variables, women were found to have a disease-free survival of less than 80% through 4 years of follow-up. This percentage is apt to decrease because the probability of treatment failure increases with time. In both trials, all subsets of women benefited from M----F or tamoxifen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The disease-free survival of all cohorts of node-negative patients with estrogen-receptor-negative or estrogen-receptor-positive tumors was poor enough to justify systemic treatment. The benefits of the therapies used are insufficient to eliminate the need for assessing putatively better regimens.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective trial in consecutive patients. SETTING: Referrals to a clinical research center. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 80 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. INTERVENTION: Kabi-secretin (2 U/kg body weight) given by intravenous bolus and calcium gluconate (10%) (54 mg/kg.h [5 mg/kg.h of calcium]) given by continuous intravenous infusion for 3 hours. Serum gastrin measured at -15, and -1 minutes before, and 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after secretin, or every 30 minutes for 3 hours during the calcium infusion. Serum calcium and serum gastrin were measured simultaneously during the calcium infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the responses of patients with different extents or locations of the tumor, presence or absence of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type-I, or with fasting gastrin less than or greater than 1000 pg/mL. In patients with fasting gastrin of less than 1000 pg/mL, the sensitivity of the secretin test using the criterion of an increase in gastrin of at least 110 pg/mL was 93% (CI, 76% to 99%) and for an increase of 200 pg/mL it was 85% (CI, 66% to 96%), (P greater than 0.05). With the calcium infusion test, the sensitivity using the criterion of an increase of 395 pg/mL was 43%, (CI, 23% to 66%) and for an increase of 50% was 74% (CI, 52% to 90%), (P less than 0.01). The calcium infusion test was positive in 33% of patients with a negative secretin test. With the secretin test, 75% of patients had a positive response by 5 minutes, 95% by 10 minutes, 100% by 15 minutes, and 6% only at 2 minutes. With calcium infusion, patients had positive responses at 120 to 180 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The secretin test is preferred over the calcium test because of its greater sensitivity and simplicity. The recommended criteria are a 200 pg/mL increase for the secretin test and a 395 pg/mL increase for the calcium test. The calcium test should be reserved for patients having a negative secretin test, gastric acid hypersecretion, and a strong clinical suspicion of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published from 1966 to 1988 were identified through a computerized search using MEDLINE, by searching the bibliographies of all identified articles, and by consulting with the cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons in the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antiplatelet Therapy After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery. STUDY SELECTION: All studies selected were randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing at least one active drug with a placebo or nonplacebo control group. DATA EXTRACTION: Key data were extracted from each article, including the percentage of patients in each treatment group with one or more grafts occluded, the percentage of patients with completed postoperative catheterizations, timing of postoperative catheterization, and timing of start of treatment. These data were easily obtained from each article and did not require multiple observers. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: All studies had positive treatment-effect sizes in favor of active treatment, although some studies did not achieve statistical significance. A meta-analysis combining all treatment effects clearly shows that active treatment is beneficial (overall effect size = 0.30; CI, 0.21 to 0.38). Efficacy improves with early initiation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs reduces the incidence of graft occlusions after coronary artery bypass surgery.\r"

Unexpected postoperative results are prevented which can occur when measurements and classical surgery are done in special problems such as paretic and restrictive strabismus and in reoperations. In addition precise alignment can be made in patients with weak fusion or fusion only in certain fields of gaze, and this should decrease the need for reoperation.\r"

A total of 43 evaluable patients with 47 infected sites were treated with aztreonam, and 41 evaluable patients were treated with aminoglycosides for 43 infections. Of patients treated with aztreonam, 17 were bacteremic, as were 12 of those treated with aminoglycosides. Clinical and microbiologic response rates were similar, except that only 5 of 11 patients with pneumonia were considered to be clinically cured with aminoglycoside therapy, while 5 of 6 patients with pneumonia treated with aztreonam were cured. Renal impairment was observed in 9 of 54 patients who received aminoglycoside antibiotics, but in only 2 of 53 patients treated with aztreonam. Hearing impairment developed in one patient treated with tobramycin. Transient elevations of serum transaminase levels occurred in 9 of 53 patients treated with aztreonam and in only 2 of 54 aminoglycoside-treated patients. Diarrhea and superinfection occurred with equal frequency in both groups. Serum concentrations of bactericidal activity could not be correlated with the outcome of therapy. Aztreonam appears to have comparable clinical efficacy with aminoglycoside antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections caused by aerobic and facultative GNB. Its use as a single agent for the treatment of serious lower respiratory infections caused by GNB warrants further evaluation.\r"

In urinary tract infections in mice with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QA-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. In pulmonary infections in mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of QA-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.\r"

The compound was from 10- to 100-fold more active than cefoxitin and broad-spectrum cephalosporins against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes. CP-65,207 was less active than imipenem for staphylococci, group A streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CP-65,207 was in general 100-fold more active than cefoxitin, 5- to 10-fold more active than broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and 2-fold more active than imipenem. Fresh clinical isolates that were resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins were highly susceptible to CP-65,207 and imipenem (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia marcescens, and anaerobic Peptococcus spp. had MIC90s of 8, 2, and 3.12 micrograms/ml, respectively. CP-65,207 was not very active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Killing kinetics showed that against some strains CP-65,207 is rapidly bactericidal at concentrations well below those required to achieve a similar degree of killing with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. CP-65,207 was only slightly susceptible to hydrolysis by type I cephalosporinases and TEM-1, SHV-1, and PSE-2 plasmid-encoded enzymes. It had the highest affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 1A, 1B, and 3 in cell-free preparations of Escherichia coli W-7.\r"

The 50% inhibitory concentration of demethylation shows that the yeast system is 100 times more sensitive than the rat system. Purified rat liver P-45014DM is about 10 times more sensitive to flusilazole than crude rat liver microsomes. Binding constants in microsomes indicate that yeast preparations (Kd, 21 nM) bind flusilazole with a higher affinity than rat liver (Kd, 496 nM). Purified rat liver P-45014DM (Kd, 45 nM) binds flusilazole with an affinity similar to that of the yeast enzyme. The P-450-dependent cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in rat liver microsomes is more sensitive to flusilazole than P-45014DM. The results indicate that selectivity of azole antimycotics is not due to inherent sensitivity differences between fungal and mammalian 14 alpha-demethylase; rather, in crude enzyme systems, a protective effect is afforded by other susceptible isozymes present in mammalian systems.\r"

Using the murine cryptococcosis model, a new oral triazole, SCH39304, has been compared with two drugs in clinical use, fluconazole and amphotericin B. BALB/c mice (nu/nu and nu/+) were challenged intracerebrally or intranasally. Oral treatment was given daily with SCH39304 at doses of 1 to 60 mg/kg of body weight or fluconazole at doses of 1 or 5 mg/kg of body weight. Amphotericin B was given intraperitoneally three times weekly, at doses of 3 or 6 mg/kg. After intracerebral challenge, SCH39304 prolonged survival in doses as low as 1 mg/kg, a dose at which fluconazole was ineffective. At equal doses, SCH39304 consistently increased survival more than did fluconazole but not longer than did amphotericin B. SCH39304 significantly lowered colony counts in brains more than did fluconazole but no more than did amphotericin B. SCH39304 was also superior to fluconazole after intranasal challenge at equal doses. SCH39304 appears to be superior to fluconazole in mice when the drugs are given at equal doses. Clinical trials are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "We report a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) for zidovudine (azidothymidine; Retrovir). This assay is accurate and specific over the clinically relevant range of zidovudine concentrations in serum (from 1 to 1,250 ng/ml; from 0.004 to 4.8 microM) and is unaffected by potentially interfering compounds in the sera of patients with renal or hepatic failure. Cross-reactivity with structural analogs of zidovudine (including zidovudine glucuronide) is less than 0.05%, except for cross-reactivities of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4% with 3-methylthymidine, 3',5'-dideoxythymidine, and A22U (the optical isomer of zidovudine), respectively. The FPIA for zidovudine is more sensitive and more specific than high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); it requires 50 to 60 or 200 versus 500 microliters of serum and is faster to perform (45 specimens per h with the FPIA versus 3 specimens per h with HPLC). The zidovudine FPIA compares well with the radioimmunoassay. A correlation coefficient of 0.992 was observed with 31 serum specimens examined by both methods. All three assays (FPIA, radioimmunoassay, and HPLC) are unaffected by the heat treatment used to inactivate human immunodeficiency virus. The zidovudine FPIA should be particularly useful for analyzing specimens from large numbers of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients receiving zidovudine in current clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Chromosomal multiple-antibiotic-resistant (Mar) mutants of Escherichia coli, selected on agar containing low concentrations of tetracycline or chloramphenicol, were 6- to 18-fold less susceptible to the fluoroquinolones than were their wild-type E. coli K-12 or E. coli C parental strains. The frequency of emergence of such mutants was at least 1,000-fold higher than that of those selected by the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin directly. When Mar mutants, but not wild-type cells, were plated on norfloxacin, mutants resistant to high levels of norfloxacin (2 micrograms/ml) appeared at a relatively high (approximately 10(-7] frequency. In addition to decreased amounts of OmpF, Mar mutants had other outer membrane protein changes and were four- to eightfold less susceptible to fluoroquinolones than was an ompF::Tn5 mutant lacking only OmpF. Accumulation of [3H]norfloxacin was more than threefold lower in the Mar mutants than in wild-type cells and twofold lower than in the OmpF-deficient derivative. These differences were not attributable to a change in the endogenous active efflux system for norfloxacin in E. coli. Norfloxacin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was threefold lower in intact cells of a Mar mutant than in susceptible cells, but this difference was not seen in toluene-permeabilized cells. Insertion of Tn5 into marA (min 34.05 on the chromosome) led to a return of the wild-type patterns of norfloxacin accumulation, fluoroquinolone and other antimicrobial agent susceptibilities, and outer membrane protein profile, including partial restoration of OmpF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Skin lesions clinically and histologically identical to pemphigus may occur in patients receiving penicillamine and captopril, but some of these patients lack circulating or tissue-bound autoantibodies. Therefore, we examined the ability of these drugs to produce acantholysis directly in organ explant culture. Human skin explants were prepared from split-thickness graft skin from adults and from neonatal foreskins. Explants were cultured in media containing 0.1 to 200 mmol/L of penicillamine or captopril; parallel drug-free control cultures were also prepared. Acantholysis occurred in all split-thickness graft skin cultures incubated for 72 hours with at least 20 mmol/L of penicillamine and at 24 to 48 hours in those incubated with at least 10 mmol/L of captopril. Acantholysis occurred less frequently in foreskin cultures, being present in 1 (8%) of 12 of those exposed to at least 20 mmol/L of penicillamine and 3 (12%) of 25 of those exposed to at least 10 mmol/L of captopril. None of the parallel drug-free control cultures developed acantholysis. Subcorneal acantholysis, resembling that seen in pemphigus foliaceus, and suprabasilar acantholysis, resembling that seen in pemphigus vulgaris, were induced in vitro. Our results indicate that both drugs can act as ligands and produce acantholysis in organ explant culture in the absence of autoantibody. This ligand-induced acantholysis may also be responsible for induction of the disease in vivo in those patients who lack demonstrable autoantibodies.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenic mechanism of preferential localization to certain skin sites of fixed drug eruption lesions has remained unknown. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from four patients with fixed drug eruptions at various time points after final exposure to the causative drug and were studied immunohistologically using monoclonal antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, and HLA-DR. The expression of ICAM-1 by keratinocytes was confined exactly to the involved epidermis. In contrast, the expression of HLA-DR by keratinocytes was observed not only in the involved epidermis but also in the uninvolved epidermis, although to a lesser extent. In general, the intensity of expression of ICAM-1 by keratinocytes correlated well with the degree of epidermal invasion of lymphocytes but not with the degree of dermal lymphocytic infiltration. Interestingly, in fixed drug eruption lesions, basal keratinocytes still showed intense reactivity for ICAM-1 6 to 10 days after final exposure to the causative drug, at which time the expression of HLA-DR was already down-modulated. Such a strong dissociation between the expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR on lesional keratinocytes was never observed at any time in the normal skin of control patients challenged with dinitrochlorobenzene. These results suggest that localized misregulated expression of ICAM-1 by the keratinocytes may be one factor that explains the preferential site-specificity characteristic of fixed drug eruptions.\r"

Some bands of this spectrum have since been delineated, and their surmised overt malignant potential realized. Recent immunologic studies have identified a number of shared immunologic markers among the various bands of this spectrum, which helps to explain the interrelationships and occasional coexistences among lymphomatoid papulosis, mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin's disease, and other lymphoproliferative disease states.\r"

Until recently, chancroid, an infection caused by the gram-negative streptobacillus Haemophilus ducreyi, was infrequently diagnosed. Continuing immigration, however, has reintroduced the disease into this country, and urban outbreaks have been associated with contact with infected prostitutes. Extensive resistance has made previous antimicrobial agents ineffective. Evaluations of multiple antibiotics and varied dosing schedules have been undertaken in an effort to circumvent this resistance. Clinicians treating patients with genital ulcerations must be aware of this disease and its geographically variable antibiotic sensitivities. Recent evidence demonstrating an association between seropositivity for the human immunodeficiency virus and ulcerative genital disease places additional importance on the timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment of chancroidal ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "Severe head injury is associated with a stress response that includes hyperglycemia, which has been shown to worsen outcome before or during cerebral ischemia. To better define the relationship between human head injury and hyperglycemia, glucose levels were followed in 59 consecutive brain-injured patients from hospital admission up to 18 days after injury. The patients who had the highest peak admission 24-hour serum glucose levels had the worse 18-day neurologic outcome (p = 0.01). Patients with peak 24-hour admission glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL had a two-unit increase in Glasgow Coma Scale score while patients with admission peak 24-hour serum glucose levels less than or equal to 200 mg/dL had a four-unit increase in Glasgow Coma Scale score during the 18-day study period (p = 0.04). There was a significant relationship between 3-month and 1-year outcome and peak admission 24-hour serum glucose level (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02, respectively). Those patients with admission peak 24-hour serum glucose levels less than or equal to 200 mg/dL had a greater percentage of favorable outcome at 18 days, 3 months, and 1 year than those with admission peak 24-hour glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL (p = 0.0007, p = 0.03, and p = 0.005, respectively). A significant relationship between admission peak 24-hour Glasgow Coma Scale score and 18-day, 3-month, and 1-year outcomes was found (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0002, and p = 0.0002, respectively). Patients with mean admission peak 24-hour Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3.5, 6, and 10 had mean admission 24-hour peak serum glucose levels of 252 +/- 23.5, 219.1 +/- 19, and 185.8 +/- 21, respectively (p = 0.05). These relationships were not significantly altered when confounding variables such as the amount of glucose given over the initial 24-hour postinjury period, the presence of diabetes or multiple injuries, and whether patients were given steroids, dilantin, or insulin were statistically incorporated. These data suggest that admission hyperglycemia is a frequent component of the stress response to head injury, a significant indicator of severity of injury, and a significant predictor of outcome from head injury.\r"

  ".W": "We have administered 1039 courses of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) to 652 cancer patients. Five hundred ninety-six patients had metastatic cancer that either had failed standard effective therapies or had disease for which no standard effective therapy existed, and 56 patients were treated in the absence of evaluable disease in the adjuvant setting. IL-2 was administered either alone (155 patients) or in conjunction with activated immune cells such as lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells (214 patients) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (66 patients), with other cytokines such as alpha interferon (a-IFN)(128 patients) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)(38 patients), with monoclonal antibodies (32 patients), or with the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (19 patients). Initial results with the treatment of high-dose IL-2 alone or in conjunction with LAK cells have indicated that objective regressions of cancer can be achieved in 20% to 35% of patients with selected advanced metastatic cancers. Although most responses have been seen in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, many histologic types of cancer have not been treated in significant numbers. These regressions can be durable; of 18 patients achieving a complete response, ten have not experienced recurrence at intervals from 18 to 52 months. Although combinations of IL-2 with TNF do not appear to result in increased responses, there is a suggestion in our initial phase I studies that the combination of a-IFN and IL-2 is more effective than the administration of cytokine alone and this combination deserves further study. Similarly the adoptive transfer of TIL in conjunction with IL-2 also appears to be more effective than the use of IL-2 alone. The toxic side effects in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 are presented and include malaise, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, fluid retention, and organ dysfunction. Treatment-related deaths were seen in 1% of all treatment courses and in 1.5% of patients. These studies demonstrate that a purely immunologic manipulation can mediate the regression of advanced cancers in selected patients and may provide a base for the development of practical, effective biologic treatments for some cancer patients.\r"

We correlated serial ankle/arm pressure indices (API) with graft patency. An interval drop in API of greater than or equal to 0.20 was considered hemodynamically significant, but interventional therapy was carried out only for clinically symptomatic graft failure and an API less than 0.20 above the preoperative value. The cumulative 5-year limb salvage rate was 82% and the patient survival was 63%. A significant drop in API did not correlate with cumulative 5-year graft patency. The 5-year cumulative primary graft patency rates were 60% and 62% in patients with stable and interval drops in API, respectively (Z = 0.15, p = N.S.) These results suggest that a significant drop in postoperative API does not predict patients with impending femoropopliteal or femorotibial graft failure.

  ".U": "90025482\r", 
  ".W": "Surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects (CCD) has undergone a remarkable evolution in the past decade. Major defects are now often completely corrected in early infancy with continually improving rates of survival. It has become clear that the next major focus will be improvements in the long-term quality of life and this has promoted many innovations in surgical technique and approach. One advance is the use of intraoperative echo with Doppler color flow imaging (echo-DCFI) to evaluate the exactness of operative repair. Aside from anecdotal reports, very little information is available regarding the interpretation of images produced by this technology in the operating room. Furthermore there have been no studies addressing the predictive value of intraoperative echo-DCFI findings with respect to outcome for patients undergoing repair of CCD. The prospective data obtained by following the course of 273 patients receiving intraoperative echo-DCFI has been reviewed after repair of a variety of CCD (age range, 1 to 53 years; mean 5.3 years; smallest patient, 1.8 kg). Forty-seven patients (17%) had initially unacceptable results, by echo, at the completion of their repair. Eighteen of these patients (7% of entire series) had no clinical problems and the defects were discernible only by echo. Twenty-six patients with initially unacceptable results had their repairs revised in the operating room and left with an acceptable result by echo. Twenty-one patients were allowed to leave the operating room with echo-discernible defects. Follow-up of these patients demonstrated a significantly higher (p less than 0.006) rate of reoperation (42% vs. 3%) and of early death (29% vs. 10%) for those patients whose defects were left unrepaired compared to those whose problems were corrected before leaving the operating room. Sixty-eight patients (25%) had some alteration of ventricular function (compared to their prebypass evaluation) at the completion of their repair. Regardless of whether the dysfunction was limited to the right ventricle, left ventricle, or was biventricular, patients in this group had a significantly higher incidence (p less than 0.004) of early, but not late, death compared to patients without alteration of ventricular function (35% vs. 4%). Patients who left the operating room with no problems of concern by echo-DCFI had a greater than 90% likelihood of a long-term acceptable outcome compared to patients who had any problem of concern (residual defect, anatomic or technical imperfection, ventricular dysfunction, and so on) whose long-term likelihood of an acceptable outcome approached 50% (p less than 0.0125).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between 1946 and 1987, 647 patients with periampullary tumors were diagnosed at the University of Chicago Medical Center. These included 549 tumors located in the head of the pancreas, 40 in the distal common bile duct, 29 in the duodenum, and 29 at the ampulla of Vater. Ninety-eight per cent of all tumors were adenocarcinoma, with 93% of the remaining being duodenal carcinoid or sarcoma. Operability rate ranged from 81% to 97%, according to the tumor location and histologic type. A combination of laparotomy, biopsy, and bypass was performed in 433 patients and only one survived 5 years (0.2%). Resectability rate ranged from 16.5% for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to 89.3% for ampullary tumors. Of the 133 resections, 80 were pancreatoduodenectomies, 29 total pancreatectomies, 7 duodenectomies, 2 gastrectomies, 8 common bile duct resections, and 7 local excisions. Overall 19% of patients who underwent radical resection died in the immediate postoperative period, although mortality has decreased to 5% since 1981. Mortality was 20% after a standard pancreatoduodenectomy and 24.1% after a total pancreatectomy. Five-year actuarial survival rates, including perioperative deaths, were 8.8%, 20%, and 32% for pancreatic, duodenal, and ampullary adenocarcinoma, respectively. One half of patients with sarcoma and two-thirds with carcinoid of the duodenum survived 5 years. No patient with distal common bile duct adenocarcinoma achieved a 5-year survival rate. Multivariate analysis on all patients operated on (n = 566) revealed that the 5-year survival rate was significantly related to intent of operation (palliative 0.2%, curative 12%; p less than 0.001), histologic type (adenocarcinoma 2%, carcinoid and sarcoma 31%; p less than 0.0001), and site (ampullary and duodenal 21%, biliary and pancreatic 0.9%; p less than 0.001). A second multivariate analysis, evaluating only those patients with adenocarcinoma who survived the perioperative period of the radical resection (n = 97) analyzed the influence of tumor size and differentiation, lymphatic, capillary, and perineural microinvasion, lymph node status, and type of procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy vs. total pancreatectomy) on 5-year survival. None of these additional variables was significantly associated with long-term survival rates. In addition we evaluated the presence of local or distant recurrence after resection by analyzing the findings from all autopsies performed on these patients (n = 49): 29.4% of patients died with local recurrence alone, 23.5% with distant recurrence alone, and 47.1% had both local and distant recurrences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All patients started out with a mean cardiac index of less than 3.0 L/min/m2, were on intraaortic balloon pump assistance, and required inotropic drugs. At 12 and 24 hours cardiac index had increased significantly in the GIK group when compared with the control group (3.6 and 3.4 versus 2.5 and 2.7 L/min/m2, respectively). Time on the intraaortic balloon pump (39 versus 61 hours) and requirements for inotropic drug support were significantly less in GIK group than in the control group. All 11 GIK patients could be weaned from intraaortic balloon pump assistance. At 30 days after operation survival was 10/11 in the GIK group, compared with 7/11 in the control group. We conclude that GIK is both safe and effective in the treatment of refractory left ventricular failure after aortocoronary bypass grafting. The exact mechanism for the beneficial effect of GIK on myocardial contractility remains to be elucidated.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the largest series reported to date of blunt injuries to these vessels. Mechanisms of injury included deceleration, traction, and crush. Half of the injured vessels were the innominate artery, and a quarter each were the common carotid and subclavian arteries. Common associated injuries were head injuries, hemopneumothorax, lung contusion, long bone fractures, and brachioplexus injuries. Widened mediastinum and extrapleural hematoma were common radiographic findings, and aortic rupture was frequently suspected. Angiography was performed in all patients to identify precisely the nature and site of the injury. Surgical approaches varied with the anatomical site of the injury and required consideration of vascular control in chest, neck, and upper extremity. Twenty-seven patients are alive 6 months to 10 years after injury. Eighteen of 20 vascular reconstructions were patent at follow-up. No patient with brachioplexus injury had return of neurological function.\r"

  ".W": "In 6 patients with pure aortic stenosis, the flow velocity waveforms in the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied using an 80-channel 20-MHz pulsed Doppler velocimeter before and immediately after aortic valve replacement. All patients showed normal coronary arteriograms. The left anterior descending coronary artery flow velocity waveform in aortic stenosis was characterized by a reverse flow in the first half of systole and a slowly increasing diastolic inflow. After aortic valve replacement, the reverse flow in the first half of systole disappeared in all patients, but an end-systolic reverse flow was discerned in 5 of 6 patients. The increasing rate of the diastolic inflow was augmented in all patients. After aortic valve replacement, the time from onset of diastole to the diastolic peak velocity was shortened from 176.8 +/- 28.8 to 90.5 +/- 18.8 ms (p less than 0.01), and the diastolic peak velocity increased from 90.5 +/- 28.0 to 122.5 +/- 17.2 cm/s (p less than 0.05). Blood pressure and heart rate, however, did not change significantly before and after valve replacement. These changes in the left coronary artery velocity waveforms after valve replacement suggest the beneficial effects of removal of aortic stenosis on human coronary artery inflow.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative autotransfusion and topical microfibrillar collagen hemostats have been increasingly used, often simultaneously, in various surgical procedures to minimize intraoperative blood loss and thus reduce the inherent risks of homologous blood transfusion. As moderate amounts of small particles have been shown to pass through filtering devices during intraoperative autotransfusion, concern has been raised over the amount of heterologous collagen fibrils transfused and their effect on the host. We found that 2% of microfibrillar collagen hemostat particles pass through the 20-microns millipore filter contained in the tested autotransfusion device (William Harvey H-4700 cardiotomy reservoir). Using a canine kidney perfusion model, we found multifocal perivascular inflammatory reactions within the renal parenchyma five days after transfusion of filtered autologous blood containing minute amounts of microfibrillar collagen hemostat. The findings demonstrate a strong inflammatory foreign body response to heterologous collagen particles trapped in the microcirculation of the perfused kidneys. It is concluded that despite using filters with a pore size of 20 microns, using intraoperative autotransfusion and microfibrillar collagen hemostats simultaneously creates a potential risk because adverse reactions can be elicited especially within the microvasculature of tissues containing end-arterial circulation.\r"

These techniques have been applied to the diagnosis of pulmonary lesions, but previous reports have focused on medical rather than surgical populations and the results have been evaluated using only retrospective patient surveys. We used a Bayesian algorithm to develop a diagnostic computer model for prospectively evaluating patients undergoing thoracotomy for suspected pulmonary malignancy. Patients who had a preoperative diagnosis were not included. Preoperative clinical and radiographic parameters for 100 consecutive patients were prospectively entered into the diagnostic model, which then categorized the lesion as benign or malignant. The computer predictions agreed with the final histological diagnosis in 95 of the 100 patients. The sensitivity was 96% and the specificity was 89% for this prospective series. These results indicate that the computer-assisted diagnosis of pulmonary lesions may have a role in this clinical setting.\r"

In the preantibiotic era, surgical thinking favored early and aggressive drainage of closed-space infections, but the dynamics of the pleural space were poorly understood and open pneumothorax generally was considered the necessary price of surgical drainage. Against bitter opposition, revision of the dogma of early open drainage was achieved in 1918 by Evarts Graham and his associates on the US Army's Empyema Commission. Unacceptable mortality rates for early drainage were brought under control through a treatment program of repeated tapping, with surgical drainage only after loculation had occurred. Paradoxically, closed water-seal drainage for empyema had been used by a German internist, Gotthard Bulau, as early as 1875. His technique was published in 1891, 27 years before the report of the Empyema Commission. As a closed system, it would have been suited to empyema drainage in either the early diffuse or the loculated stages. Thoracotomy was not possible at the time, and Bulau probably could not foresee the future importance of his method to surgery.\r"

Implantation methods include the subcoronary technique, miniroot inclusion technique, and aortic root replacement. Technical variations such as valve inversion during implantation, valve rotation, and continuous or interrupted suture methods are important in certain techniques. The allograft aortic valve is a versatile device that can be used in the surgical management of the full range of aortic valve and aortic root pathology.\r"

To determine if antihypertensive loading prior to initiation of maintenance therapy improved or hastened blood pressure control, 64 asymptomatic patients with severe hypertension were randomized to treatment with (1) hourly doses of clonidine hydrochloride followed by maintenance therapy (group 1); (2) an initial dose of clonidine followed by hourly placebo and subsequent maintenance therapy (group 2); or (3) maintenance therapy without prior loading (group 3). There was no difference between groups 1 and 2 in the time required to achieve acceptable blood pressure control during loading therapy, nor was there a difference at 24 hours in pressure reduction between groups 1,2, or 3. Further follow-up in 44 of these patients at 1 week demonstrated adequate control of systemic blood pressure in all groups, but no difference between groups. In view of the small but reported risk of antihypertensive loading and the burden and expense of prolonged emergency department therapy, these results suggest that the common practice of acute oral antihypertensive loading to treat severe, asymptomatic hypertension should be reconsidered.\r"

Regular exercise and physical stress are also important in avoiding falls.\r"

Twenty-nine of 33 DVT+ patients had abnormal PPG and/or reflux by venous Doppler ultrasound, whereas 39 of 49 DVT- patients had normal PPG and no Doppler reflux (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 80%). Of 33 DVT+ patients, 20 had abnormal Doppler results (sensitivity, 61%), in contrast to 46 of 49 DVT- patients with normal results (specificity, 94%). Moreover, 23 of 33 DVT+ patients showed abnormal PPG results (sensitivity, 70%), whereas 40 of 49 DVT- patients had normal PPG (specificity, 82%). Based on our findings, the presence of Doppler reflux is specific for previous proximal DVT, whereas a combination of normal PPG and Doppler ultrasound is reliable for excluding previous proximal DVT. Abnormal PPG with normal Doppler ultrasound does not reliably predict the presence or absence of previous DVT. However, this occurred in only 16 of 82 patients. Therefore, the combination of PPG and venous Doppler ultrasound can reliably predict the presence or absence of previous proximal DVT in most patients.\r"

Diagnoses included cryptococcal meningitis (24 patients), cryptococcemia (19 patients), cryptococcuria (4 patients), osteomyelitis (1 patient), pulmonary cryptococcosis (1 patient), and soft-tissue cryptococcosis (2 patients). Twenty-six patients had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 4 were transplant recipients. Therapy (200 mg two times per day) was monitored by clinical response, culture, and cryptococcal antigen testing. Cryptococcemia was abolished in 10 (100%) of 10 assessable patients; clinical abnormalities also cleared. Thirteen (65%) of 20 assessable patients with cryptococcal meningitis had complete responses (clinical resolution and negative cultures), 5 (25%) had partial responses, and therapy failed in 2 (10%). Ten (71%) of 14 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who had meningitis and were treated with itraconazole as their sole therapy had complete responses, 3 (21%) had partial responses, and therapy failed in 1 (7%). Partial responses or failures were all associated with the failure of previous therapy, severe disease, low serum itraconazole concentrations, or a resistant organism. Noncompliance was associated with relapse (4 patients). Meningitis recrudesced in 3 (20%) of 15 patients who responded to therapy. All 4 patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis, soft-tissue cryptococcosis, or osteomyelitis responded to therapy (100%). Cryptococcuria was abolished in 3 (60%) of 5 assessable patients. The median survival of the 20 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who had meningitis exceeded 10.5 months at this writing. Overall results compare favorably with amphotericin B therapy with or without flucytosine. Forty of 44 isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans were susceptible in vitro to itraconazole (minimum inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 3.13 mg/L), 3 were borderline (minimum inhibitory concentration, 6.25 mg/L), and 1 was resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration, 12.5 mg/L). As itraconazole does not penetrate cerebrospinal fluid, the meningitis results are noteworthy and suggest that meningeal and parenchymal penetration is critical. Itraconazole is promising for the treatment of cryptococcosis in patients with and without the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

We discuss the selective use of digital rectal examination, transrectal sonography, directed prostate biopsy, and prostate-specific antigen determinations before therapy and in subsequent follow-up in this age group of men during androgen replacement.\r"

To test a dopamine receptor modification strategy, 16 patients with tardive dyskinesia were assigned to treatment with a neuroleptic plus bromocriptine (a dopamine agonist) or placebo for 10 weeks in a rising-dose design. Patients were evaluated weekly during the 10-week treatment period and for 8 weeks after medication withdrawal. No significant treatment effect was found in tardive dyskinesia response in the overall sample. When patients were classified by tardive dyskinesia subtype, patients with choreoathetoid symptoms exhibited only slight improvement with active treatment, which persisted after drug withdrawal; patients with dystonic symptoms showed moderate improvement that was drug and dose dependent. The sustained administration of substantial doses of a dopamine agonist did not produce significant adverse effects, including behavioral toxic effects. These results, although not statistically significant, are of clinical and heuristic interest.\r"

Haloperidol and benztropine treatment was continued, while those patients who consistently scored greater than 17 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were randomly assigned to the following double-blind treatment groups for 4 weeks: adjunctive amitriptyline hydrochloride, desipramine hydrochloride, or placebo. Adjunctive desipramine or amitriptyline showed no significant therapeutic advantage, when compared with haloperidol and placebo, on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. After 4 weeks of combine therapy, patients receiving adjunctive amitriptyline or desipramine, as compared with those receiving adjunctive placebo, tended to score higher on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale hallucinatory behavior item and on the thinking disturbance factor than patients receiving placebo. These results suggest that adjunctive antidepressants are not indicated for the treatment of depressive symptoms in actively psychotic schizophrenic inpatients. Adjunctive antidepressants may retard the rate of resolution of psychosis in this population.\r"

Given unfavorable polygenic potentiators (eg, introversion, hypohedonia, and anxiety) and adverse life experiences (eg, childhood trauma or adult misfortune), around 10% develop schizophrenia. That schizophrenia is basically a neurologic disorder does not contradict whatever is known about its psychodynamics, nor preclude efficacy for psychotherapy or other psychosocial interventions. Research should concentrate on soft neurology and psychophysiology as indicators, being closer in the causal chain to the schizogene than psychometric, social, or high-level cognitive processes. Taxometric statistics are appropriate to testing a major locus model not simplistically formulated.\r"

  ".W": "Before 1950, there was no clear perception of the interrelationship of serum lipids, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease. Since then, research laboratories have made conflicting claims for the most useful measurement of the serum lipid levels in detecting and managing coronary heart disease. Emphasis has been placed in turn on the measurement of levels of serum cholesterol, lipoproteins, triglycerides, and, currently, cholesterol and lipoproteins again. Physical separation and characterization of serum lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis resulted in two classification systems for lipoproteins based on hydrated density and electrophoretic mobility, respectively. Two operational by-products were the atherogenic index, an empirical formula supposed to correlate with coronary heart disease, and a phenotype system for classification of the lipoproteinemias. Current National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria for atherosclerosis risk implicate elevated levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although triglycerides are closely associated with cholesterol in lipoprotein molecules and are positively associated with cardiovascular disease, there is no strong evidence of elevated levels of plasma triglycerides as an independent risk factor in coronary heart disease. Elevated levels of triglycerides can help identify persons with increased risk of cardiovascular disease from other causes, but screening for hypertriglyceridemia is not recommended. Apolipoproteins and lipoprotein Lp(a) are briefly discussed.\r"

Nineteen YSTs with this pattern were identified. The mesenchyme-like component of these YSTs appeared to derive from the epithelial elements of YST, since cytokeratin as well as vimentin positivity occurred in the spindle cells of the mesenchyme-like areas and foci of epithelial-spindle cell transition were present. In some cases the mesenchyme-like component showed differentiated mesenchymal elements (usually skeletal muscle). Similar features were identified in 13 chemotherapy-treated cases of YST that consisted only of this mesenchyme-like component. The mesenchyme-like component of YST appears to represent a chemoresistant, pluripotential cell population arising from metaplasia of YST epithelium; it may give rise to sarcomas occurring in some patients with treated germ cell tumors.\r"

This material is periodic acid-Schiff positive and diastase resistant, suggesting that it is glycoprotein in nature. We used the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method to identify this material using antibodies to the serum glycoproteins carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and alpha-fetoprotein on paraffin sections of pancreas obtained from a total of 21 patients: 9 with cystic fibrosis, 5 with chronic pancreatitis, and 7 controls. The control patients had normal pancreatic histologic findings, no alpha 1-antitrypsin or alpha-fetoprotein was demonstrated, and only the ductular epithelium reacted weakly for carcinoembryonic antigen. The pancreas in pancreatitis showed fibrosis, acinar atrophy, and ectasia of the ducts that contained only a small amount of periodic acid-Schiff-positive material. This material reacted weakly for carcinoembryonic antigen and alpha 1-antitrypsin. The appearance of the pancreas in cystic fibrosis was similar to that in chronic pancreatitis. However, the ducts contained a greater amount of periodic acid-Schiff-positive material, mostly in the form of globules that reacted strongly for carcinoembryonic antigen and alpha 1-antitrypsin and weakly for alpha-fetoprotein, as did the ductular epithelium. This study shows that the periodic acid-Schiff-positive material in cystic fibrosis contains at least the three serum glycoproteins and that the accumulation may represent a possible defect in cellular synthesis, assembly, or transport of glycoproteins in the ducts.\r"

Eight fetuses had complete proximal obstruction. Seven of the 8 did well after maternal transport to a perinatal center and prompt neonatal surgery. Six fetuses had distal obstruction with dilated bowel and increased peristalsis. Two died after birth (1 with severe associated anomalies and 1 with short-bowel syndrome), and the other 4 did well. Three fetuses had a false-positive diagnosis of in utero meconium peritonitis. Two died and the other had no postnatal evidence of obstruction. Our data suggest (1) polyhydramnios may not be present early in gestation or with distal obstruction; (2) other anomalies, including a family history of cystic fibrosis, should be sought; (3) dilated bowel with increased peristalsis is diagnostic of fetal gastrointestinal tract obstruction, whereas intra-abdominal calcification and ascites are nonspecific findings; (4) late development of ascites in a fetus with documented obstruction may be an indication for early delivery; and (5) prenatal diagnosis permits appropriate counseling, planned delivery, and prompt postnatal resuscitation and surgery with a good prognosis in most cases.\r"

Methods to improve reimbursement include increasing the ratio of blunt to penetrating trauma victims and by assembling a team knowledgeable in reimbursement options.

After the diagnosis has been clearly established using lumbar puncture and imaging techniques, the neurologist is involved in helping to lower the intracranial pressure, control the headaches, and encourage weight loss. Careful vision monitoring is essential and should be done in collaboration with an ophthalmologist. Visual fields, fundus photographs, intraocular pressure measurement, and visual acuity should be performed at each follow-up visit. The use of visual evoked response and repeated measurement of intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture do not provide data that help to guide therapeutic decisions. Indications for surgery are loss of visual field or decline in visual acuity in the fact of medical therapy, persistent headache, or the inability to perform visual-function studies. Optic nerve sheath fenestration and lumbar peritoneal shunt both appear to be effective surgical means to reduce the pressure on the optic disc. A neurologist and an ophthalmologist working together provide the evidence on which to base rational decisions in the care of the patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.\r"

Autoscopic seizures may be more common than is recognized; we found a 6.3% incidence in the patients we interviewed. The temporal lobe was involved in 18 (86%) of the 21 patients in whom the seizure focus could be identified. There was no clear lateralization of lesions in patients with ictal autoscopy. The response of autoscopic episodes to treatment usually paralleled that of the underlying seizure disorder. Autoscopic phenomena are likely to be discovered only on specific questioning of patients with epilepsy and may be an important, distressing feature of a chronic seizure disorder.\r"

  ".W": "In cerebral asphyxia, enhanced postsynaptic stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by excessive glutamate may mediate neuronal injury and death. The neuroprotective potential of the novel, potent NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was assessed by evaluating hippocampal behavioral and histologic outcomes in an experimental rat model of neonatal hypoxia/ischemia. Seven-day-old rats with and without MK-801 pretreatment were subjected to unilateral carotid ligation followed by 2 hours of hypoxia. At age 30 days, spontaneous alternation behavior was measured using a conventional wooden T maze. Hypoxic-ischemic animals pretreated with saline demonstrated a significant impairment in spontaneous alternation behavior compared with that of normal control rats and the hypoxic-ischemic rats pretreated with MK-801. Hippocampal neuronal damage in the CA1 and CA3 regions was prevented in animals pretreated with MK-801 vs saline-treated controls. Therefore, while saline-treated rats with hippocampal lesions showed defective memory and hippocampal neuronal destruction, pretreatment with MK-801 protected rats. Thus, MK-801 appears to protect hippocampal neurons from hypoxia/ischemia and may be potentially beneficial in preventing neonatal asphyxial brain damage.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred fifty-four patients with definite multiple sclerosis were followed up prospectively for 1 to 5 years (mean, 2.6 years). None of the patients received immunosuppressive medication. Yearly exacerbation rates and each patient's adherence to initial disease type were determined. Disease type was defined at entry and prospectively each subsequent year as stable, relapsing remitting stable, relapsing remitting progressive, or chronic progressive. Exacerbation rates determined prospectively did not decline significantly during 3 years of follow-up, even if patients were stratified by disease duration. Adherence to the initially assigned disease type was highly variable. When followed up for 2 years, 30% of patients with chronic progressive disease had conditions become stable, 32% of patients with stable disease had conditions become chronic progressive, 20% of patients with relapsing remitting disease had conditions become stable, and 20% of patients with relapsing remitting disease had conditions become chronic progressive. Patients with stable or relapsing remitting stable disease switched to one of the progressive categories as frequently (44%) as patients with progressive disease stabilized (46%). Progression of disease measured by changes in Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scores did not differ between the different disease types. The results challenge dogma regarding the natural history of exacerbation rates and the assumption that we can reliably assign patients to a specific disease type. The findings have important implications for understanding the natural history of multiple sclerosis and designing clinical trials.\r"

Muramic acid is a ubiquitous component of bacterial cell walls, and it has been proposed that it could serve as a chemical marker for the presence of live bacteria or bacterial debris in rheumatoid joints. Our goal was to determine whether muramic acid was present at detectable levels in septic SF, since this would serve as a positive control for studies of reactive and rheumatoid arthritis. Muramic acid was found to be present at levels of less than 250-1,700 ng/ml in 12 septic SF samples (10 of which were culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Among these samples, those containing low bacterial colony counts did not contain detectable muramic acid. Muramic acid was also not detected in any SF samples from 20 control patients. We conclude that muramic acid can be used as a marker for the presence of bacterial peptidoglycan in SF. With further lowering of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detection limits, determination of the quantities of bacterial debris present in joints of patients with rheumatoid or reactive arthritis will be attainable.\r"

Four demographic characteristics were different in the patients with inadequate immunity (in decreasing order of significance): advanced age, fewer years of education, female sex, and non-US origin. Fourteen of the inadequately immunized patients were over 70 years of age. Of the 84 patients who reported their immunization histories, five reported no complete series of tetanus shots but had adequate antibody levels, while three reported a complete series but had inadequate levels. Twenty-two patients with inadequate immunity were not offered immunization in the emergency department because they did not have wounds. Patient recall of immunization history is not a reliable guide to tetanus immunization in the emergency department, but patients in certain demographic groups, such as older women, are more likely to have inadequate immunity.\r"

The mean OSATs were 95.4% for wheezing children and 98.7% for controls. An initial OSAT of 95% or more indicated a low need for hospitalization. An initial OSAT less than 85% indicated a high need for hospitalization (positive predictive value, 90%).

  ".W": "Prehospital care was retrospectively reviewed in 117 pulseless nonbreathing (PNB) pediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) to determine the effects of immediate countershock treatment of asystole. Of 90 (77%) children with an initial rhythm of asystole, 49 (54%) received countershock treatment. Rhythm change occurred in ten (20%) of the asystolic children who received countershock treatment. Three of the countershocked asystolic children were successfully resuscitated, but none survived. Rhythm change occurred in nine (22%) of the asystolic children not countershocked. Six were successfully resuscitated, and one survived. The two groups (countershocked asystole v noncountershocked asystole) did not differ significantly in age, sex, witnessed arrest, witnessed arrest with bystander basic life support (BLS), prehospital endotracheal intubation, both intubation and vascular access success, or diagnosis. However, prehospital vascular access was successfully established in a significantly greater number of countershocked patients (P less than .05). The mean times to the scene, at the scene, and to the hospital for the countershocked v noncountershocked asystolic patients were 6.2, 23.8, and 6.1 v 5.9, 14.7 and 7.0 minutes. The mean time at the scene was significantly greater in the countershock group (P less than .001). The successful performance of prehospital endotracheal intubation was significantly associated with rhythm change (P less than .05). Patients age, witnessed arrest, witnessed arrest with bystander BLS, successful establishment of prehospital vascular access, diagnosis, and countershock treatment were not significantly associated with rhythm change. In conclusion, prehospital countershock treatment prolonged prehospital care time and was not associated with rhythm change in asystolic children. Therefore, prehospital countershock treatment of asystolic children is not recommended.\r"

The physicians acquired a moderate level of expertise in sonography using a series of practical demonstrations and lectures. Patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac, gynecologic, biliary tract, and abdominal vascular disease periodically underwent ED sonography. The initial interpretation was used as a diagnostic adjunct to subsequent therapy. The accuracy of positive sonographic findings was assessed by confirmatory testing, formal review, or confirmatory clinical course. Emergency physicians were able to diagnose correctly (1) the presence and approximate size of pericardial effusions, (2) the presence or absence of organized cardiac activity in patient with clinical electrical mechanical dissociation, (3) the presence or absence of intrauterine pregnancy in pregnant patients with lower abdominal/pelvic complaints, (4) the position of intrauterine devices in patients with suspected uterine perforation, (5) the presence of gallstones in patients with suspected biliary tract disease, and (6) the presence and size of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with pulsatile masses or unexplained abdominal pain. It was concluded that reliable sonography which influences diagnosis and therapy can be performed by emergency physicians and that sonography should become a standard procedure in EDs.\r"

We studied the hypothesis that blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor would prevent the depression of cerebral high-energy phosphates found in perinatal asphyxia without producing alterations in cerebral blood flow, and thus prevent neuropathologic damage. Newborn beagle puppies were anesthetized, tracheotomized, ventilated, and randomized to asphyxial insult (I = discontinuation of ventilatory support for 5 min) or no insult (NI) and drug treatment with MK801 (10 mg/kg intravenously) or an equal volume of saline (S). Puppies received MK801 or saline 15 min prior to I/NI. In S/I pups during insult, blood flow increased to brainstem structures but decreased elsewhere. MK801 had no effect on cerebral blood flow in either control or insulted puppies. 1H NMR studies demonstrated no effect of the MK801 on NI brains. Phosphocreatine levels were 1.7 +/- 0.1, 0.6 +/- 0.1, and 0.9 +/- 0.1 mmole/kg (mean: +/- S.D.) for the S/NI, S/I, and MK801/I pups, respectively. Cerebral lactate was 1.3 +/- 0.2, 3.0 +/- 0.7, and 2.0 +/- 0.4, respectively. The pH fell 0.8 units in the S/I puppies, compared to 0.4 units in the MK801/I puppies. We conclude that pretreatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 in part protects the developing brain against severe metabolic insult.\r"

Antiantigen M stains the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells and certain other cells in tissues of normal and hypertensive rabbits. We now report studies in which pure 125I hog and rabbit renin have been infused into hypertensive rabbits for seven-day periods and the tissues subsequently examined for nondegraded radioactive components. The concentration and the distribution of radioactivity found in different tissues of six rabbits that received hog renin and six that received rabbit renin showed enormous variation, for which there is no reasonable explanation. A very significant amount of radioactivity was found to be incorporated into a high molecular weight or insoluble form that may be antigen M. A major portion of the radioactivity has a molecular weight of about 40,000 and has been assumed to be unaltered 125I renin. In plasma there was a very high molecular weight radioactive component that was capable of binding to antirenin or antiantigen M antibodies to a limited degree. In addition there was a major component with a molecular weight of 68,000 that is not formed in vitro but is produced in vivo. It resembles prorenin in human plasma in that it does not adsorb on pepstatin-Sepharose and does adsorb on Cibacron Blue. However, it differs from prorenin in that it does not bind to antirenin antibodies nor can it be activated by trypsin.\r"

To evaluate the effect of age on LV filling in children, Doppler transmitral flow velocity A/E ratios and echocardiographic measurements were obtained in 51 normal children (mean age 12 +/- 4 years) of hypertensive parents (study children), sex- and age-matched against 28 normal children (mean age 12 +/- 4 years) from normotensive parents (control children). There was a significant correlation between age and LV systolic and diastolic internal dimensions (r = 0.74 and 0.83, respectively, P less than .0001, in study children, and r = 0.70 and 0.79, respectively, P less than .0001, in control children), total wall thickness (r = 0.72, P less than .0001, in study children, and 0.61, P less than .001, in control children), and with LV mass index (r = 0.56, P less than .0001 and r = 0.45, P less than .02, respectively). In contrast, there was no correlation between age and transmitral flow velocity A/E ratio in either group (r = 0.12 and 0.07, respectively). In conclusion, age does not have an effect on LV filling in normal children from either normotensive or hypertensive parents. Therefore, age correction of A/E ration, which is necessary in adults, is not required in children. Because of a strong correlation between age and LV mass as well as LV mass index, age should be taken into account when defining criteria for LV hypertrophy in children.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacological suppression of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), both as monotherapy and in conjunction with other conventional agents, has been proven to be an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Renin is the enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate limiting step, preceding the involvement of ACE, in the production of the potent pressor hormone angiotensin II (Ang II). Unlike ACE, which has multiple substrates, renin is selective for a single naturally occurring substrate, angiotensinogen. Interruption of the generation of ANG II by renin inhibitors at the highly specific, initial step of the cascade may have therapeutic advantages over ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive agents with less precise mechanisms of action, by producing fewer clinical side effects. Exciting advances in the discovery of renin inhibitors have led to the synthesis of potent, dipeptide inhibitors of renin, which have been shown in the laboratory to be efficacious hypotensive agents when administered intravenously. Although there are recently reported compounds that demonstrate some degree of oral activity, efforts to enhance bioavailability are presently underway in order to develop orally active therapeutic agents. The development of renin inhibitors will provide target-specific agents for the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders, and will serve as invaluable tools to study the role of the RAS in regulating blood pressure and fluid volume. An overview of the progress in the discovery and development of renin inhibitors is presented.\r"

We have identified a group of normal-renin hypertensives characterized by inability to modulate normally their renal vascular and adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II. These patients handle shifts in Na intake abnormally, show more positive balance on a high-salt diet, and raise their blood pressure when shifted to a high-salt diet. Renal blood flow does not shift with Na intake, but does respond strikingly to converting enzyme inhibition, which also corrects altered renal and adrenal responsiveness, ability to handle a sodium load, and hypertension. These patients have a striking family history of hypertension; 50% of the offspring of hypertensives show similar features, including a renal vasodilator response to converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blocking agents. Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormality is inherited and may be the most common form of hypertension.\r"

Such salt restriction reduced body weight, blood volume, cardiac index (CI) and urinary sodium excretion equally in all groups, whereas mean blood pressure was reduced by 16 mm Hg in only ten hypertensive GN, but not in normotensive GN and the control group. In hypertensive GN the reduction of blood pressure was accompanied by blunt responses in the total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) and plasma norepinephrine (PNE). By contrast, in normotensive GN and the control group the reduction of CI was compensated for by increased TPRI, resulting in unchanged blood pressure. Among GN with and without hypertension, changes in TPRI by salt restriction were significantly correlated with changes of PNE. In conclusion, renal parenchymal hypertension is sustained by elevated vascular resistance and increased plasma norepinephrine as well. Blood pressure reduction by salt restriction is consistent with the low responses in TPRI and PNE.\r"

After a transient fall, the blood pressure gradually increased. At five and ten minutes after administration of each of the three doses, the blood pressure was significantly elevated compared with baseline values. Renal blood flow decreased immediately after infusion of 1 nM/kg endothelin, and this decrease lasted throughout the observation periods, while 0.1 nM/kg endothelin did not affect renal blood flow. At 2, 5, and 10 minutes after infusion of 1.0 or 0.5 nM/kg endothelin, renal vascular resistance was significantly elevated. These hemodynamic alterations were dose-dependent. The results show that endothelin has potent hypertensive and renal vasoconstrictive effects in rats.\r"

Prazosin and terazosin have been shown to be well tolerated in clinical practice and seldom cause impotence or metabolic abnormalities. The most common adverse effects--dizziness, headache, and asthenia--are generally well tolerated and infrequently lead to discontinuation of therapy. First-dose syncope can usually be avoided by initiating therapy with low doses administered at bedtime. Finally, the alpha 1 receptor antagonists do not adversely affect such cardiovascular risk factors as hypokalemia, serum lipid profile, and left ventricular hypertrophy. In fact, alpha 1 antagonists reduce total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein plus very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and thus may contribute to the overall management of cardiovascular risk by blood pressure reduction and improvement of the serum lipid profile. Since the goal of treating chronic essential hypertension is to improve morbidity and mortality, the choice of therapy should be influenced by the agent's ability to modify as many risk factors as possible. Alpha 1 adrenoreceptor antagonists beneficially impact several cardiovascular risk factors and thus merit consideration as first-line antihypertensive therapy.\r"

In a 6-hour chromium-release assay, only Leu-19+ NK cells mediated significant lysis. Furthermore, cell lines established from poorly differentiated cancers were more sensitive to lysis than were cell lines established from well-differentiated cancers. Cell lines from well-differentiated cancers also less readily inhibited K562 lysis in a cold-target inhibition assay, were not recognized by NK cells in a monolayer absorption assay (unlike poorly differentiated cancers), and failed to form conjugates with NK cells in a single-cell assay. These results indicated that deficient killing of a well-differentiated cancer cell vs a poorly differentiated cancer cell is partly a function of diminished NK cell recognition and tumor binding necessary to initiate lysis. As in previous studies regarding the prognostic implication of quantitated measures of NK cell activity within head and neck cancer patients, the results support the biologic relevance of the NK cell as a defense mechanism against metastatic disease, especially in patients with poorly differentiated, low major histocompatibility complex class I-expressing head and neck cancers.\r"

Enflurane produced seizure-like burst discharges in CA1 pyramidal neurones, accompanied by depressed field potential amplitudes and a reduced threshold for synaptically evoked population spikes. However, threshold for action potentials evoked by intracellular current injection did not change, nor did action potential amplitude, duration or spike frequency accommodation in single neurones. Enflurane 2.0 vol% hyperpolarized CA1 neurones (3.1 (SD 1.3)mV), decreased membrane conductance (12 (6)% below control), and depressed EPSP amplitudes (34% of control) (P less than 0.01). Enflurane appeared to enhance both intrinsic and synaptically mediated inhibitory potentials. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist amino-phosphonovalerate (APV) 5-20 mumol litre-1 completely blocked seizure-like burst discharge of CA1 neurones in the presence of enflurane, and the enflurane-induced reduction of population spike threshold; it did not alter anaesthetic depression of EPSP amplitude.

These data indicate that these agents block synaptic transmission in the olfactory cortex by different mechanisms.\r"

The results show significant differences in echo amplitude between all the tumours and normal skin. When the tumour A-scan traces were analysed the results indicated that the best discriminating feature between tumours was that of amplitude, followed by regularity, density, non-normalized thickness and finally amplitude of echoes from beneath the tumour. Ultrasound-derived skin thickness measurements were compared to histological measurements for the lesions, and an excellent correlation was found (r = 0.96). It was considered that the A-scan ultrasound investigation of small tumours of the skin was able to provide information on the nature of the tissues contained and may assist in their differential diagnosis.\r"

The patients studied included 18 with bullous pemphigoid (BP), nine with cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), three with acquired epidermolysis bullosa (EBA) and 7 hybrid cases. The patterns of IMF in the suction blisters were: BP, epidermal 1, dermal 1, combined 4, negative 12; CP, epidermal 1, dermal 2, negative 6; EBA, dermal 2, negative 1; and 'hybrid' patients, epidermal 3, negative 4. The different patterns of suction blister staining could not be correlated with the clinical features of the patients in respect of mucous membrane involvement, scars or milia or a history of skin fragility. Both BP and CP are probably heterogeneous in respect of their antigen specificity, and the two diseases cannot reliably be distinguished by the patterns of direct IMF on suction blisters. In addition, some individual patients with BP have more than one target antigen as indicated by a combined pattern of suction blister fluorescence. The lack of correlation between the pattern of suction blister fluorescence and the clinical features suggests that factors other than antigen specificity determine the clinical expression of subepidermal blistering diseases.\r"

A reference group of 218 women, matched for age and day of delivery, within 1 week, was used for comparison. Perinatal morbidity was significantly more frequent in the gestational diabetic pregnancies (23%) than in the reference group (13%), whereas the occurrence of large-for-gestational-age infants was not different between the groups. Infants born to women with gestational diabetes were categorized to a no-morbidity group (n = 200) and a morbidity group (n = 61). The group with morbidity had significantly shorter gestational age at delivery, higher frequency of caesarean section, higher maternal pre-pregnancy weight and higher area under the glucose tolerance curve. There was no significant difference in third-trimester blood glucose between the groups. Discriminant analysis revealed that the most significant influence on neonatal morbidity was gestational age at delivery. After correction for this factor the only factor with added significance for neonatal morbidity was maternal pre-pregnancy weight. The present study clearly illustrates that other factors beside blood glucose control are of importance for neonatal outcome in gestational diabetic pregnancy.\r"

The waveforms were analysed by calculating a ratio of the peak systolic to end diastolic frequency (A/B ratio). An A/B ratio greater than 95th centile from our derived normal values was classified as abnormal. Three outcome variables were examined: birthweight for gestational age, the standard deviation birthweight score and the ponderal index. Although of the 56 pregnancies with an abnormal Doppler result 34 (61%) were associated with a SGA infant, only 41% of all the SGA infants had an abnormal Doppler result. Alternative measures of growth, the ponderal index and the SD birthweight score, showed that on average the babies in the Doppler abnormal group were smaller than those in the Doppler normal group, but the overlap between the normal and abnormal groups was large. Therefore although Doppler ultrasound appears to identify groups of smaller babies, it does not identify individual pregnancies where the baby will be small at birth.\r"

Oestradiol levels were high in 54 cystic fluids, and a combination of oestradiol estimation and cytology facilitated the identification of a follicular origin. Most such patients would normally have undergone surgery, but this was eventually required in only 10 of 60 in whom the cyst fluid was clear or slightly blood-stained and in 16 of the 28 with heavily blood-stained fluid. Ultrasound-guided ovarian cyst puncture would appear to be a valid alternative to surgery for carefully selected benign ovarian cysts especially when the cyst is considered not to contain blood.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of an entire clinical series of 152 women over 50 years of age, in whom cystic lesions without solid parts had been diagnosed by ultrasound, found there were no malignancies in 58 completely anechoic lesions less than 5 cm in diameter. Of 10 small lesions (less than 5 cm in diameter) with some echogenicity or septa, one was a borderline tumour. In contrast, in patients with lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter there were three malignancies in the group of 33 totally anechoic cysts, five in the group of 32 cysts with some echogenicity, and as many as eight malignancies in the 18 lesions where several septa were present. Two borderline and one malignant tumour had been missed at previous clinical examination. We conclude that small anechoic lesions are seldom, if ever, malignant in elderly women. Sonography is helpful in patients with a negative clinical examination when pelvic pain or signs of malignancy are present.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating IgG autoantibodies that produce cytoplasmic immunofluorescence staining of ethanol-fixed normal neutrophils have recently been found in a large percentage of patients with active Wegener's granulomatosis. Such autoantibodies are rarely found in other diseases and are therefore virtually diagnostic of Wegener's granulomatosis. The nature of the neutrophil antigen defined by these autoantibodies is controversial and the roles of the antigen and/or autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis are unknown. We studied serum samples that produce the cytoplasmic pattern of staining from 10 patients with a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. By Western blot analysis, all 10 sera reacted with a 29-Kd neutrophil protein (p29). We generated a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against this antigen. The monoclonal antibody produced the same immunofluorescence staining pattern as the serum autoantibodies and was used to affinity-purify p29. The purified antigen had a novel N-terminal sequence homologous to members of the serine proteinase family and bound to radiolabeled diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). We conclude that the neutrophil antigen responsible for the cytoplasmic staining pattern produced by autoantibodies in patients with active Wegener's granulomatosis is a distinctive serine proteinase.\r"

  ".U": "90028711\r", 
  ".W": "We report that hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing the CD34 antigen (CD34+ cells) transiently circulate in the peripheral blood (PB) of cancer patients treated with 7 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (HD-CTX) with or without recombinant human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF). In adult humans, CD34+ cells represent a minor fraction (1% to 4%) of bone marrow (BM) cells, comprising virtually all hematopoietic colony-forming progenitors in vitro and probably also stem cells capable of restoring hematopoiesis of lethally irradiated hosts. We show that CD34+ cell circulation is fivefold enhanced by rHuGM-CSF 5.5 protein micrograms/kg/day by continuous intravenous infusion for 14 days after HD-CTX. During the third week after HD-CTX (ie, when CD34+ cells peak in the circulation), large-scale collection of PB leukocytes by three to four continuous-flow leukaphereses allows the yield of 2.19 to 2.73 x 10(9) or 0.45 to 0.56 x 10(9) CD34+ cells depending on whether or not patients receive rHuGM-CSF. The number of CD34+ cells retrieved from the circulation by leukaphereses exceeds the number that can be harvested by multiple BM aspirations under general anesthesia. Thus, after therapy with HD-CTX and rHuGM-CSF, PB represents a rich source of hematopoietic progenitors possibly usable for restoring hematopoiesis after myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. To determine whether CD34+ cells found in the PB are equivalent to their marrow counterpart, we evaluated their in vitro growth characteristics and immunological phenotype by colony assays and dual-color immunofluorescence, respectively. We show that PB CD34+ cells possess qualitatively normal hematopoietic colony growth and high cloning efficiency comparable to that observed with BM CD34+ cells. In addition, PB CD34+ cells display heterogeneous surface membrane differentiation antigens analogous to BM CD34+ cells. The availability of large quantities of CD34+ cells by leukapheresis is relevant to the field of stem cell transplantation and possibly to genetic manipulations of the hematopoietic system in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by marrow stromal cells from human long-term marrow cultures and from stromal cells transformed with simian virus 40 was examined. As with other cultured mesenchymal cells, unstimulated stromal cells produced undetectable amounts of IL-6 mRNA when assayed by Northern blots. However, within 30 minutes after exposure of transformed marrow stromal cells to the inflammatory mediators, recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) or recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), significant increases in IL-6 expression were observed. The time course of IL-6 mRNA upregulation in transformed marrow stromal cells with IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha differed: The maximal response to TNF alpha was observed at 30 minutes whereas that to IL-1 alpha occurred at 8 hours. Although IL-6 at a concentration of 500 U/mL was inhibitory to adherent transformed marrow stromal cell proliferation, a concentration-dependent stimulation of anchorage-independent colony growth was observed when the cells were plated in semisolid medium with IL-6. The stromal cell colony-stimulating effect of IL-6 was abrogated by a neutralizing antibody to IL-6. Moreover, the heteroserum with anti-IL-6 activity and two anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies partially blocked autonomous and IL-1 alpha-induced colony formation, suggesting that colony formation by transformed marrow stromal cells may require IL-6. Clonal-transformed stromal cell lines were derived from the anchorage-independent stromal cell colonies. Both IL-6 mRNA and protein were constitutively produced at high levels. The addition of IL-6 to either long-term marrow culture adherent cells or transformed marrow stromal cells downregulated the expression of collagen I, a major stromal cell matrix protein. Thus, IL-6 affects proliferation of stromal cells and influences their production of extracellular matrix, suggesting that IL-6 may have indirect as well as direct influences on hematopoietic cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "90028716\r", 
  ".W": "Leukemic cell growth in the marrow microenvironment may be modulated by stromal cell products, including stimulatory growth factors and the inhibitory regulator prostaglandin E. The production of both of these stromal cell products induced by cytokine mediators appears to be closely linked. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is an intracellular second messenger that inhibits myeloid cell proliferation and is produced in myeloid leukemia cells on stimulation of adenylate cyclase enzyme by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Cells expressing the product of an RAS oncogene have been observed to display diminished hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase of membranes. If this observation were applicable to myeloid cells, a potentially important mode for leukemia cells expressing p21 RAS to escape inhibitory regulation within the hematopoietic microenvironment would be identified. We studied an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid cell line, NFS/N1.H7, and a derivative line transfected with H-RAS codon 12 (T24) oncogene, H7 Neo Ras.F3, for inhibition of proliferation by PGE1, 1 microM, alone or in combination with pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gi, an inhibitory regulatory guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein of adenylate cyclase. NFS/N1.H7 cells were inhibited in interleukin-3-dependent proliferation (dose range, IL-3 10 to 100 U/mL) by PGE1 79 +/- 11%, by pertussis toxin 51 +/- 9%, and by the combination 92 +/- 2%, whereas H7 Neo RAS.F3 was inhibited 51 +/- 7%, 6 +/- 2%, or 58 +/- 9% by PGE1, pertussis toxin, and the combination, respectively. These differences in capacity for inhibition by adenylate cyclase agonists between RAS-transfectant cells (lower inhibition) versus parent cells (greater inhibition) were all highly significant (P less than .0005). Intracellular cAMP formed on PGE1 stimulation of pertussis-intoxicated cells was 150% lower in RAS-transfectant cells than in parent cells. The adenylate cyclase activity of membranes from pertussis-intoxicated RAS-transfected cells was 1.5 to two times lower than that of pertussis-intoxicated parent-cell membranes on Mg2+-dependent activation by hormone and/or guanine nucleotide. However, very similar adenylate cyclase activity was observed in oncogenic p21 RAS-containing membranes compared with parental membranes under conditions of direct activation by 4 mM Mn2+ and forskolin, where inhibitory or stimulatory G-protein influences are minimal. These studies showed diminished adenylate cyclase activity in mutant RAS-bearing myeloid-cell membranes compared with parent-cell membranes independent of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Attempts to study the putative factor(s) regulating these ploidy changes have been frustrated by the lack of an appropriate in vitro model of megakaryocyte endomitosis. This report describes a culture system in which rat bone marrow is depleted of identifiable megakaryocytes and enriched in their precursor cells. Morphologically identifiable megakaryocytes appear when the depleted marrow is cultured in vitro. The total number of nucleated cells, as well as the number of megakaryocytes and their ploidy distribution, are quantitated very precisely by flow cytometry. Although the total number of nucleated cells declines by 35% to 40% over 3 days in culture, the number of megakaryocytes rises 10-fold. The number of nucleated cells, the number of megakaryocytes, and the extent of megakaryocyte ploidization behave as independent variables in culture and are dependent on the culture conditions. The addition of recombinant erythropoietin promotes a rise in the number of megakaryocytes and a shift in ploidy to higher values while recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor is without effect on the cultured megakaryocytes. This in vitro system may provide a means to study those factors that affect megakaryocyte growth and ploidization.\r"

  ".W": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a rapidly progressive and usually fatal malignancy of mature T cells characterized by the expression of large numbers of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors on the cell surface. Anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-2 receptor, was conjugated to liposomes and compared with anti-transferrin receptor (anti-TFR) conjugates for specific binding, internalization, and intracellular drug delivery to ATL cells. Two independent assays were used: a fluorimetric assay with liposome encapsulated 1-hydroxypyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid, a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, and a growth inhibition assay using methotrexate-gamma-aspartate, a liposome-dependent cytotoxic drug. MT-1 and HUT-102 cell lines derived from patients with ATL were compared with Molt-4, a leukemia cell line that does not express IL-2 receptors in an uninduced state. Fluorimetric studies showed specific binding and internalization of anti-Tac-conjugated liposomes by HUT-102 and MT-1 but not by the Tac-negative cell line Molt-4, demonstrating the lack of nonspecific or Fc receptor-mediated uptake. Anti-TFR-conjugated liposomes were effectively bound and internalized by all three cell lines and consistently showed the highest degree of cellular liposome uptake. Drug-containing liposomes conjugated to anti-Tac were more than tenfold more effective in causing growth inhibition of ATL cells than the nonspecific control conjugates. Anti-Tac conjugates caused minimal growth inhibition of Molt-4 cells over the concentration range effective against the ATL cells. Anti-TFR-coupled liposomes gave better growth inhibition of HUT-102 and MT-1 cells (40- to 60-fold) than anti-Tac conjugates. Both anti-Tac-directed and anti-TFR-directed liposomes are effective for intracellular drug delivery to ATL cells and may represent a useful method of treatment in this disease.\r"

The optimal effect was obtained by pretreatment of cells with 25 to 50 ng/mL (1.3 to 2.6 nmol/L) rhG-CSF for 10 minutes at 37 degrees C. rhG-CSF produced by bacteria and mammalian cells had identical biological effects on a molar basis. rhG-CSF neither affected stimulus-induced increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ nor changed the number and affinity of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptors. The priming effect of rhG-CSF was temperature dependent and did not require new protein synthesis. rhG-CSF increased the expression of C3bi receptors on human granulocytes and enhanced granulocyte adherence to nylon fiber. The optimal effect was obtained by pretreatment of cells with 25 to 50 ng/mL rhG-CSF for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C. rhG-CSF had no effect on human monocytes. These findings demonstrate that rhG-CSF can selectively stimulate mature granulocyte functions.\r"

Therefore, to supplement chemoseparation, we investigated whether MRK-16, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to the surface moiety of multidrug resistance-associated P-glycoprotein antigen, can eliminate drug-resistant tumor cells in the presence of rabbit complement (RC). Two doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant human myeloma tumor cell line, 8226/DOX40 (resistant to 4 x 10(-7) mol/L DOX) and 8226/DOX6 (6 x 10(-8) mol/L DOX) with high and low amounts of cell surface P-glycoprotein, respectively, and the drug-sensitive parent cell line 8226/S were used as tumor models in this study. Using the limiting dilution assay, we have shown that three cycles of treatment with 25 micrograms/mL of MRK-16 MoAb and a 1:4 final dilution of RC eliminated 2.90 +/- 0.10 logs of 8226/DOX40 cells and 1.94 +/- 0.18 logs of 8226/DOX6 cells. One and two cycles of treatment were less effective, eliminating 0.47 +/- 0.40 and 1.94 +/- 0.36 logs of 8226/DOX40 and 0.12 +/- 0.20 and 1.63 +/- 0.58 logs of 8226/DOX6 cells, respectively. The 8226/S cell growth was unaffected by one to three cycles of treatment. The cell kill was not impaired when the antibody plus complement treatment was carried out on a mixture of 8226/DOX40 or 8226/DOX6 cells with a ninefold excess of irradiated bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs). The three cycles of treatment with antibody plus complement did not adversely affect granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) survival in hematologically normal marrows (92.5% to 104% survival) or in myeloma patient marrows (85% to 100%). These results show that it is possible to eliminate drug-resistant myeloma tumor cell lines from the admixed human bone marrow by treatment with MRK-16 MoAb plus RC. This method could prove to be effective for elimination of other drug-resistant tumor cell lines including those of leukemia and solid tumors, and will be further useful for supplementing chemopurging, and immunopurging of bone marrow with other antitumor cell antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell-accessory-cell interaction in mixed lymphocyte cultures was investigated in 25 patients following autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) using autologous bone marrow treated in vitro with the cyclophosphamide derivative ASTA Z 7557. In a previous study using the same group of patients, T cells failed to synthesize interleukin-2 (IL-2) and proliferate in response to CD3- and CD2-mediated stimuli even in the presence of exogenous IL-2. To investigate whether this defect in IL-2 synthesis and proliferation was caused by defective cell-to-cell interactions, we analyzed mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) using T cells and irradiated non-T cells. When normal T cells from 10 different healthy subjects were challenged with allogeneic normal non-T cells, IL-2 production and proliferation were observed. In contrast, when normal T cells were cultured with non-T cells derived from patients found between 20 and 330 days after ABMT, no IL-2 secretion and no proliferative responses could be seen. The addition of lymphokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-3 (IL-3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-gamma (IFN-y) did not improve the reactions. Furthermore, when patients' T cells were incubated with normal, irradiated non-T cells, defective IL-2 synthesis or proliferative response was obtained. However, when IL-2 was added to these cultures, an improvement in proliferative reactions was observed. Taken together, these new data provide additional evidence that T cells early in ontogeny possessed an intrinsic defect in IL-2 synthesis and that physical cell-to-cell contact between patients' T cells and allogeneic accessory cells induced functional responsiveness to exogeneous IL-2.\r"

Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA hybridizing with either genomic or cDNA p53 specific probes indicated that 30% of the CML patients at blastic crisis phase exhibited rearrangements, mostly mapping downstream to the first non-coding exon. This is compatible with the observation that the progression of CML from the chronic to the acute phase involves frequent aberrations in chromosome 17, to which the p53 oncogene has been mapped. Therefore, we suggest that one of the pathways of development of CML to the acute phase is associated with aberrations in the p53 nuclear oncogene.\r"

  ".U": "90028775\r", 
  ".W": "Two human hemopoietic growth factors involved in monocytopoiesis, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were studied for their ability to stimulate blood monocytes and to bind to the monocyte membrane. Both cytokines maintained monocyte/macrophage numbers during long-term culture and increased cell size as compared with controls. Effects on cell numbers were present at low cytokine concentrations (6 to 20 pmol/L), whereas enhanced 3H-thymidine incorporation was observed only at higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 60 pmol/L). Autoradiographic studies showed only 1% to 3% of stimulated monocytes with nuclear grains. These results suggest that the primary mechanism for IL-3 and GM-CSF-induced maintenance of monocyte/macrophage numbers in humans is through an effect on cell survival. Surface receptors for both IL-3 and GM-CSF were studied by using 125I-labeled recombinant human (rh) cytokines and performing Scatchard analyses. Both cytokines showed curvilinear Scatchard plots, and computer analyses favored a two-site binding model. High-affinity binding data for 125I rhIL-3 (Kd 7.7 to 38.2 pmol/L; receptor number/cell 95 to 580) and for 125I rhGM-CSF (Kd 4.7 to 38.9 pmol/L; receptor number/cell 8 to 67) show similar binding affinities for the two cytokines but a lower receptor number/cell for 125I rhGM-CSF. Low-affinity binding characteristics for 125I rhIL-3 (Kd 513 to 939 pmol/L; receptor number/cell 179 to 5,274) and for 125I rhGM-CSF (Kd 576 to 1,120 pmol/L; receptor number/cell 130 to 657) show a similar pattern for the two cytokines. Specificity of 125I rhIL-3 and 125I rhGM-CSF binding to monocytes was established by the ability of the homologous cytokine to inhibit binding and the inability of a range of other cytokines to compete at 100-fold excess molar concentration. It is important, however, that binding of 125I rhIL-3 was partially inhibited by rhGM-CSF and that rhIL-3 partially inhibited binding of 125I rhGM-CSF to the monocyte membrane under conditions shown to prevent receptor internalization. The degree of inhibition varied between 25% and 80% in different experiments, and quantitative inhibition experiments showed that 1,000-fold excess concentrations of competitor failed to inhibit binding of the heterologous ligand completely. These results demonstrate that human IL-3 and GM-CSF have similar effects on growth and survival of human monocytes in vitro and suggest that these and other common biological effects may be mediated either through a common receptor or through distinct receptors associated on the monocyte membrane.\r"

  ".U": "90028776\r", 
  ".W": "Juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder of early childhood that is clinically and cytogenically distinct from the well-recognized adult type of chronic myeloid leukemia. Unlike the adult disease, growth of hematopoietic progenitors from peripheral blood (PB) occurs in the absence of exogenous stimulus even at low cell densities. This so-called \"spontaneous\" growth can be abrogated by adherent cell depletion and appears to depend on production of endogenous growth factors. We studied seven children with JCML to determine the nature of endogenous stimulators. With isolated PB mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and a 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation assay, JCML cells were shown to incorporate high levels of 3H-TdR when cultured in the absence of stimulus even at low cell densities. When neutralizing antisera prepared against each of the four known colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, and interleukin-3 (IL-3), as well as antisera against interleukin-1 (alpha and beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were added to these cultures, only the antisera against recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) consistently resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, achieving up to 72% inhibition of 3H-TdR incorporation in one case. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against rhGM-CSF resulted in a similar and highly significant degree of inhibition. A marked inhibitory effect of rhGM-CSF antiserum on \"spontaneous\" growth of PB CFU-GM derived colonies in semisolid medium was also demonstrated in four of five patients studied (87% to 90% inhibition). Production of growth factors by highly enriched JCML monocytes was variable. When initially studied in five of the seven patients, the monocytes from three of the patients revealed increased release of IL-1-like activities; two patients had levels similar to those of controls. One patient with normal levels when initially studied was later shown to have markedly increased amounts of IL-1-like activities in a second preparation of monocyte-conditioned medium (MCM). High levels of GM-CSF were detected in the initial MCM from one patient, but this may have indirectly reflected elevated IL-1-like activities present in the MCM. IL-3 and M-CSF levels were either low or undetectable in the patients studied as compared with MCM prepared with normal adult monocytes. These results clearly implicate GM-CSF as the primary endogenous regulator of JCML cell proliferation in culture and suggest that this malignant myeloproliferative disease may in part result from paracrine stimulation of marrow progenitor cells by growth factors/cytokines secreted by the malignant monocytes.\r"

We found that lymphotoxin, a product of activated lymphocytes, stimulates accumulation of granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF and macrophage (M)-CSF proteins and mRNAs in fibroblasts. An increase in GM- and M-CSF mRNA levels occurred within 2 hours after addition of 1,000 U/mL lymphotoxin and levels plateaued over the next 24 hours. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was about five times more potent than lymphotoxin at low concentrations, and was nearly 1.5 to to 2 times more potent at maximally stimulating concentrations of the cytokines. Stimulation by lymphotoxin did not require either new protein synthesis or protein kinase-C stimulation. Stability studies of GM- and M-CSF transcripts in fibroblasts showed that M-CSF mRNA was five times more stable (half-life [t 1/2], 100 minutes) than GM-CSF mRNA (t 1/2, 20 minutes). Stability of these mRNAs was unchanged after stimulation of the cells with lymphotoxin. In addition, exposure of cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate did not alter stability of M-CSF mRNA but markedly prolonged the stability of GM-CSF mRNA. This is consistent with data showing that the AT-rich consensus region in the 3' untranslated region of many transiently expressed cytokines including GM-CSF but not M-CSF, play a major role in their mRNA stability. Our results suggest that activated lymphocytes can affect hematopoietic cell function and growth by stimulating production of CSFs by mesenchymal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was found to act synergistically with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on granulocytic colony growth of normal human bone marrow cells, depleted of mononuclear phagocytes and T lymphocytes. Using CD34/HLA-DR-enriched bone marrow cells we demonstrated that this activity of IL-1 was not a direct action on hematopoietic progenitor cells, but an effect of an intermediate factor produced by residual accessory cells in response to IL-1. Neutralization experiments using an anti-IL-6 antiserum showed that IL-1-induced IL-6 did not contribute to the observed synergy. Furthermore, IL-6 by itself had neither a direct stimulatory effect on CFU-GM colony growth, nor did it act synergistically with GM-CSF on granulocytic or monocytic colony formation. Neutralization experiments with an anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibody showed that IL-1-induced G-CSF production was responsible for the synergy with GM-CSF. Using combinations of G-CSF and GM-CSF this synergistic activity could be detected at concentrations of G-CSF as low as 0.1 ng/mL (10 U/mL). Our results indicate that IL-1, but not IL-6, stimulates the GM-CSF-dependent proliferation of relatively mature myeloid progenitor cells in the presence of small numbers of accessory cells.\r"

  ".U": "90028789\r", 
  ".W": "Hairy cells are stimulated to DNA synthesis by low molecular weight B cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF) and this proliferative response is suppressed by interferon (IFN)-alpha, both in vitro and in vivo. The suggestion that the CD23 molecule (Fc epsilon II receptor) might be involved in the signalling pathway of LMW-BCGF prompted us to study the expression of this molecule on hairy cells and its modulation by IFN-alpha. By flow cytometry and direct binding experiments with anti CD23 monoclonal antibodies, the presence of the CD23 antigen was detected in 7 of 12 cases tested, on variable percentages of cells, ranging from low to medium expression. In vitro incubation of hairy cells with IFN-alpha, which elicits a suppression of the proliferative response of these cells to LMW-BCGF, induced a parallel significant reduction of CD23 expression in only three cases. Similarly, a transient in vivo decrease of CD23 expression, concommitant with an inhibition of the LMW-BCGF response, could be detected in only one of three patients injected with IFN-alpha. Soluble sCD23/IgE-binding factor (BF) was quantitated in the serum from six other patients with hyperleukocytic hairy cell leukemia (HCL) undergoing a clinical trial of IFN-alpha therapy. Before treatment, these patients presented higher concentrations of the cleaved soluble form of the CD23 molecule than normal controls. Within a few weeks of IFN-alpha administration, these levels markedly decreased, paralleling a diminution of blood leukemic cells. Of interest, no such diminution was noticed for another patient resistant to IFN-alpha therapy. These results show that the proliferative response of hairy cells to LMW-BCGF is not linked to the expression of the CD23 marker. Besides, when the latter molecule was present, its decrease following IFN-alpha treatment, which could be detected in some cases, was not necessarily required for the suppression of the LMW-BCGF response and is thus not mandatory for the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha. Our results point out that quantitation of serum sCD23/IgE-BF, whether related to a process of autocrine proliferation or not, is a parameter of potential importance for therapy monitoring.\r"

  ".U": "90028792\r", 
  ".W": "A new B-lymphoma cell line (DEAU-cell line) was established from a diffuse large-cell lymphoma (centroblastic type) and was successfully grafted in athymic nude mice. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were generated using splenocytes of DEAU-tumor bearing mice. Before the fusion experiments, cellular immunity of the mice bearing growing DEAU tumors was restored by injection of spleen cells from conventional Balb/C mice. Spleen cells from conventional Balb/C mice immunized with DEAU-cell line were also used for the generation of MoAbs. Four MoAbs (DBB.42 and DBA.44 from normal Balb/C mice, and DNA.7 and DND.53 from athymic nude mice) were investigated because they identified B-cell-associated antigens not destroyed by fixatives. DBB.42 recognized a pan-B cell-associated antigen (molecular weight (mol wt) = 45 Kd). DBA.44 detected a B-cell antigen (mol wt not determined) expressed on a subpopulation of B lymphocytes in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles. DNA.7 also defined a B-cell antigen (43 Kd) mainly expressed on germinal center cells. Similarly, DND.53 recognized a B-cell antigen (two bands of mol wt 20 Kd and 35 Kd, respectively) mainly expressed on germinal center cells and mantle zone lymphocytes and interdigitating reticulum cells in the paracortical area. Major differences were found in the reactivities of these MoAbs on malignant lymphomas. DBB.42 was positive with almost all B-cell lymphomas and some T-cell lymphomas. Within the group of low-grade B-cell lymphomas, DBA.44 reacted principally with hairy-cell leukemia. DNA.7 reacted mainly with high-grade B-cell lymphomas with a weak positivity in low-grade B-cell lymphomas. DND.53 reacted with all but one B-cell lymphoma, cells of histiocytosis X, and Reed-Sternberg cells. These findings indicate that new MoAbs can be generated by using spleen cells from athymic mice bearing human tumors as well as by new lymphoid cell lines. The MoAbs so generated, as in the present study, are deemed potentially useful for the recognition of B-cell lymphomas in routine diagnostic histopathology. In addition, DND.53 could be of value for the diagnosis of histiocytosis X and the detection of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease.\r"

The dose was lower than that usually recommended to induce a consistent fall in serial plasma testosterone levels to within the castrate range. Most patients treated with oestrogen showed an initial clinical and biochemical response equal to that obtained for patients undergoing orchiectomy. The inevitable relapse in hormone sensitivity sometimes occurred very soon after the start of oestrogen treatment. Many patients had poorly suppressed plasma testosterone expressed as a mean of monthly serial measurements, but then responded to secondary orchiectomy. These data only suggest that, in the treatment of hormone-sensitive prostatic carcinoma, it may be necessary to reduce plasma testosterone to midway between castrate and normal ranges. The data support the theory that response to androgen withdrawal is qualitative rather than quantative. The effective dose of oestrogen may therefore be reduced and the risk of thrombo-embolic complications minimised.\r"

  ".W": "Surgery of the short saphenous vein is associated with a high recurrence rate because of variations in the anatomy or inadequate clinical examination. To prevent this, accurate definition of the pattern and level of termination of the saphenopopliteal junction and flush ligation is necessary. Clinical examination, Doppler ultrasound, duplex scanning and peroperative venography have been compared to assess the level of termination of the short saphenous vein. In all, 64 limbs of 46 patients were examined. In 39 limbs there was primary short saphenous incompetence, in 13 limbs there was recurrent short saphenous incompetence; in ten of these there was incompetence of the gastrocnemius vein. In 12 limbs a duplex scan did not demonstrate incompetence of the short saphenous vein or gastrocnemius vein. The accuracy of these methods when locating incompetence of the short saphenous vein to within 2 cm of the saphenopopliteal junction was 56 per cent for clinical examination, 64 per cent for Doppler ultrasound and 96 per cent for duplex scanning. When there was no saphenopopliteal junction (9 per cent), duplex scanning correctly detected the pattern of the incompetent vein. The apparent success of clinical examination was because the vein was not felt above the femoral intercondylar groove and 52 per cent of the veins terminated at this level. Duplex scanning is a non-invasive technique which is almost as accurate as venography and provides additional haemodynamic information about the incompetent veins by demonstrating the presence and extent of reflux.\r"

  ".U": "90029363\r", 
  ".W": "Anal sphincter function was assessed by digital examination and anal canal manometry in 66 patients and controls. Digital scores were allotted by using visual analogue scales for basal and squeeze sphincter function and were compared with the corresponding pressures. There were good correlations between digital basal score and maximum basal pressure (Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs = 0.56, P less than 0.001), and digital squeeze score and maximum squeeze pressure (rs = 0.72, P less than 0.001). There were wide ranges of sphincter function on digital and manometric assessment with considerable overlap between patient groups. Digital scores detected differences in sphincter function between patient groups as accurately as manometry. The sensitivities and specificities of digital scores and anal canal manometry in segregating continent and incontinent patients were similar. It was concluded that digital estimation was equally as good as assessment of anal sphincter function as anal canal manometry.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary restrictions on the positivity rate and yield of neoplasia during a study based on Haemoccult screening for colorectal neoplasia. Of 18,925 participants who completed Haemoccult tests on a normal diet, 647 (3.4 per cent) were positive. All repeated the test with dietary restrictions: 251 remained positive and underwent further investigations which revealed 35 carcinomas and 169 adenomas in 129 subjects. The remaining 396 were sent a further Haemoccult test at 3 months. Of these, 317 (80.1 per cent) completed the test: 31 (9.8 per cent) were positive. Further investigation of the 31 positive subjects revealed four carcinomas and 20 adenomas. Retesting with dietary restriction will reduce the false positive rate of Haemoccult when used for colonic cancer screening. However, if the retest is negative a further test should be performed. To minimize the adverse effect this may have on compliance, we have allowed an interval of 3 months to elapse before this retest is requested.\r"
