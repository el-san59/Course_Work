  ".W": "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's \"Guide to Clinical Preventive Services\" summarizes the results of a critical review of the literature pertaining to the effectiveness of 169 interventions in modifying 60 risk factors or conditions. The ultimate impact of the guide depends on the diffusion into clinical practice of its recommendations. This report reviews the factors influencing the diffusion process. Three categories of behavioral influence--predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors--apply to this diffusion process. Predisposing factors include knowledge and attitudes, personal health behaviors, confidence, and beliefs about patients' interests in health-promotion advice. Enabling factors include competence to perform preventive services, reimbursement for preventive services, organization of the practice setting, time to provide preventive services, a reminder system, and a coherent set of guidelines that are perceived as scientific and unambiguous. Reinforcing factors include peer support, feedback, evidence of results, and an enhanced sense of self-efficacy in fulfilling one's role as a healer. Recommendations are given for using these factors to increase the diffusion of preventive services into clinical practice.\r"

The conventional radiologic examination consisted of panoramic radiography and lateral transcranial view of the fracture in the mouth-open and mouth-closed positions. Sixteen patients with 21 fractures of the condylar process were examined additionally by computed tomography (CT) because of temporomandibular joint problems in the sagittal and coronal projection. Computed tomography revealed bony changes in the fractured mandibular condyle and its position in the mandibular fossa more exactly than conventional radiographic examinations. Furthermore, the results showed that disturbances in the position and function of the articular disc may be more common than was earlier anticipated, suggesting the more frequent use of CT examinations to evaluate temporomandibular joint changes after condylar process fractures.\r"

Clinical evaluation showed that neither implant demonstrated significant movement, and assessment of gingival inflammation and sulcus depth showed no significant differences between them. After axial sectioning, the titanium implants were easily removed from the bone, whereas the HA-coated implants were adherent to the bone. Histologically, both implants showed osteogenic ingrowth to the surface in functional and nonfunctional conditions. High-magnification scanning electron micrographs of plastic sections showed that a portion of the interface between the HA-coated implant and the bone showed no gap, whereas gaps were observed at all interfaces with the titanium implant. Histomorphometric analysis by light microscopy indicated that there was no significant difference in the percent bone contact length. Clinically, the two implants behaved similarly.\r"

Thirty of the 34 patients had articulation errors before surgery. Errors on the sibilants /s/ and /z/ occurred most frequently, followed by those on /j,zh,ch/ and /sh/. Errors were predominantly distortions with both visual and acoustic components. After surgery, articulation improved spontaneously in the absence of intervention. Most of the preoperative articulation errors were eliminated by 3 months postoperative, but, thereafter, a gradual decline was noted so that by 12 months, errors occurred on /s/ and /z/. Voice, resonance, velopharyngeal port area, and hearing sensitivity were not altered by surgery. This study suggests that severe skeletal malocclusions requiring surgical correction have deleterious effects on the patients' articulation of consonants and that surgical alteration leads to the correction of most of these errors.\r"

With this technique, attention was focused on vertical alveolar ridge resorption in the anterior maxilla. Although the sample size was small, the findings from this study indicate that vertical bone loss in the anterior maxilla does occur when a maxillary denture is opposed by an implant-supported overdenture. Comparison of these results with a previous study that evaluated anterior maxillary resorption when a complete maxillary denture opposed natural mandibular anterior teeth and a distal extension removable partial denture demonstrated no statistically significant difference.\r"

A high-molecular-weight, as-polymerized poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) was used for repair of orbital floor defects of the blowout type in goats. An artificial defect was created in the bony floor of both orbits. Reconstruction of the orbital floor was then carried out using a concave PLLA implant of 0.4-mm thickness. At 3, 6, 12, 19, 26, 52, and 78 weeks postoperatively, one goat was killed. Microscopic examination showed full encapsulation of the implant by connective tissue after 3 weeks. After 6 weeks, resorption and remodeling of the bone at the points of support of the implant could be detected. A differentiation between the sinus and orbital sides of the connective tissue capsule was observed. The orbital side showed a significantly more dense capsule than the antral side, which had a loose appearance. At 19 weeks, a bony plate was progressively being formed, and at 78 weeks, new bone had fully covered the plate on the antral and orbital side. No inflammation or rejection of the PLLA implant was seen.\r"

(2) What are the correlates of school difficulty? (3) Are behavior problems associated with school difficulty when variables are controlled for these correlates? The analysis revealed that 34% of very low birth weight children could be characterized as having school difficulty, compared with 20% and 14% of the other groups, respectively, and that they were more likely to have higher scores on the hyperactive subscale of the Behavior Problems Index. Although a broad array of sociodemographic factors correlated with school difficulty, very low birth weight and hyperactivity scores contributed independently to the risk of academic problems. We conclude that very low birth weight infants are at risk of having school problems that are in part associated with hyperactive behavior.\r"

Structural abnormalities, delayed myelination, or a combination of the two were detected with MRI at 8 months of age in all nine infants with later development of cerebral palsy. Three of the four normal infants and one infant with suggestive abnormalities had normal serial MRI findings. Each of the remaining two infants (one normal, one with suggestive abnormalities) had isolated persistent ventricular dilation on all three MRI studies. Our results suggest that 8 months appears to be the earliest time at which MRI findings correlate well with later adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in this population.\r"

  ".W": "We studied urinary acidification daily during the hospital course of 16 infants with acute gastroenteritis and metabolic acidosis. Urine pH value on admission was higher than 5.5 in 14 (87%) patients. We hypothesized that inappropriate urinary acidification was due to sodium deficiency and inadequate sodium delivery to the distal nephron. Forty-one urinary samples were collected during metabolic acidosis. The mean pH of 24 urine samples with sodium concentration less than 10 mmol/L was significantly higher than the pH of 17 samples with sodium concentration greater than 10 mmol/L (6.04 +/- 0.06 vs 5.19 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). The urine ratios of titratable acid to creatinine and of total acidity to creatinine were significantly higher in urine samples containing more sodium (p less than 0.02), whereas the ammonium/creatinine ratio was not. After administration of furosemide or correction of the sodium deficit, appropriate acidification was observed. We conclude that impaired urinary acidification is frequently found during metabolic acidosis in infants with acute gastroenteritis and results from a sodium deficit rather than from transient distal renal tubular acidosis.\r"

Of the 11 children who had proteinuria, eight had the nephrotic syndrome. Of the 10 whose condition progressed to end-stage renal failure, seven were less than 3 years of age. The histologic features of Wilms tumor were favorable in all seven children, and the tumor was bilateral in three. Of the nine patients who had genital abnormalities, eight had 46,XY karyotype and either ambiguous genitalia (six patients) or normal female phenotype (two). One other patient had a normal 46,XX female karyotype and phenotype but had both mullerian and wolffian structures and a streak ovary. Nine patients had a distinct pelvicaliceal abnormality not previously reported as a feature of this syndrome. Other congenital abnormalities were aniridia, mental retardation, deafness, nystagmus, and cleft palate. This syndrome must be considered in any infant with unexplained nephropathy, particularly in young phenotypic female infants and in those children with ambiguous genitalia or Wilms tumor with an early presentation.\r"

Thirty-nine low birthweight neonates (less than 1500 gm) with confirmed PDA were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive standard indomethacin therapy (three doses), followed either by maintenance indomethacin therapy (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 5 days or by an equivalent volume of placebo for 5 days. Of the 20 infants who received maintenance indomethacin therapy, two (10%) required additional therapy and one of these required surgical ligation. Of the 19 infants who received only the first three indomethacin doses, nine (47%) required additional therapy for PDA (p less than 0.05) and seven of these had a ligation (p less than 0.05). We conclude that maintenance indomethacin therapy, in comparison with short-term indomethacin therapy, decreases the incidence of surgical PDA ligations, eliminates most PDA recurrences, and does not increase toxic effects of indomethacin in the low birth weight infant with PDA.\r"

A cohort of 178 children younger than 36 months of age with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease were followed. Forty-seven infants whose respiratory syncytial virus infection resulted in mild symptoms of less than or equal to 72 hours' duration received ribavirin (n = 20) or water placebo aerosol (n = 27) either in a hospital or at home. Outcome measures included respiratory and analog score, room air oxygen, saturation, and oxygen flow needed to maintain saturation at greater than or equal to 91%. No difference in age, gender, family size, passive smoking, baseline oxygen saturations in room air, or duration of symptoms before treatment was found between groups. After 3 days of therapy, ribavirin produced a greater rate of improvement of analog scores (p = less than or equal to 0.001), lower oxygen requirements (p = 0.01), and higher oxygen saturation (p = 0.01). Respiratory scores and total hospital days did not differ significantly between the groups. Treatment failure occurred in 2 of 20 children (10%) in the ribavirin group versus 5 of 27 children (18%) in the placebo group, a nonsignificant difference. No child required assisted ventilation or had an adverse reaction. We conclude that early ribavirin therapy may help to reduce morbidity from respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk young children.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a short course of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) could provide safe antiretroviral activity in children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection and whether it could be used with azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine). The goal was to maintain uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy while sparing AZT-related myelosuppression and ddC-related neuropathy. METHODS: In a pilot study, we evaluated four dosage levels of ddC--0.015, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 mg/kg, given orally every 6 hours--in 15 children between 6 months and 13 years of age with Centers for Disease Control P2 (i.e., symptomatic) human immunodeficiency virus infection. Thirteen patients had not had any prior antiretroviral therapy; two patients had received and benefited from AZT, but dose-limiting neutropenia had developed. At each dosage level, ddC was given for 8 consecutive weeks and then stopped. After a 30-day rest, a schedule of ddC for 1 week was followed by 3 weeks of AZT therapy (180 mg/m2 every 6 hours); this alternating schedule was repeated for as long as tolerated. Age-appropriate psychometric testing was performed before the start of ddC therapy and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: During the 8 weeks of therapy with ddC alone, no neutropenia or anemia was observed; 6 of 9 patients had decreases in p24 antigen levels, and 8 of 15 had an increased CD4 cell count. At the 0.04 mg/kg level, a rash developed in three patients; mild mouth sores developed in 9 of 15 patients. On the alternating ddC/AZT schedule, no neuropathy was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 2',3'-Dideoxycytidine has antiretroviral activity in some children and appears to be safe for short intervals. Longer courses of ddC at lower dosage levels, and schedules integrating ddC into combination regimens, deserve to be explored.\r"

Nine patients had ulcerative colitis and 12 patients had Crohn disease; the patients' ages ranged from 3 to 17 years. The median duration of disease before the start of azathioprine therapy was 2 years, and median follow-up was 2 years. Sixteen patients seemed to respond to azathioprine therapy: six patients in each disease group had complete responses and four patients (one with ulcerative colitis and three with Crohn disease) had partial responses. Two patients with ulcerative colitis and three patients with Crohn disease did not respond. The median time until patients responded was less than 3 months for patients with ulcerative colitis and 4 months for those with Crohn disease. Reduction of corticosteroid dose was possible for all patients who responded to azathioprine therapy. Only minimal side effects were attributable to the drug. We conclude that azathioprine is an effective adjunctive agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood, but because questions remain regarding its long-term safety, its use should be reserved for children with refractory disease or severe and unacceptable side effects of corticosteroids.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we investigated the effects of the prokinetic drug cisapride in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic recurrent distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). After a baseline period, 17 patients (12.9 to 34.9 years; 12 boys) received, in random order, cisapride (7.5 to 10 mg) and placebo three times daily by mouth, each for 6 months. Gastrointestinal symptoms (flatulence, abdominal pain, fullness, abdominal distension, nausea, anorexia, heartburn, diarrhea, vomiting and regurgitation) were scored three times monthly and physical examinations assessed. At baseline and at each 6-month period, assessment included food intake for 7 days, 3-day stool collection, pulmonary function tests, and abdominal radiographs. During cisapride therapy compared with placebo, there were significant reductions in flatulence (p less than 0.005), fullness, and nausea (p less than 0.05). Patients with the worst symptom scores benefited most from cisapride. With cisapride, 12 patients felt better and three worse (p less than 0.05); physicians judged 11 patients improved and two worse (p less than 0.05). No side effects were noted. There were no significant differences between cisapride and placebo periods in nutritional status, x-ray scores, pulmonary function, food intake (fat, protein, calories), stool size and consistency, and fecal losses of fat, bile acids, chymotrypsin, and calories. For acute episodes of DIOS, intestinal lavage was needed 6 times in 4 patients during treatment with cisapride, and 11 times in 6 patients receiving placebo. In comparison with unselected patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency who were receiving enzyme supplements and who had no distal intestinal obstruction, fecal fat losses (percentage of intake) were almost twice as high in the study group with DIOS (31.2 +/- 20.6% vs 16.2 +/- 17.6%; p less than 0.01). We conclude that in the dosage used, long-term treatment with cisapride appears to improve chronic abdominal symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis and DIOS, but fails to abolish the need for intestinal lavage. Cisapride treatment had no effect on digestion and nutritional status of cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency.\r"

We studied the pharmacokinetics of MTX given intravenously or orally to nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, once with and once without TMP-SMX. There was an increase in free MTX fraction during TMP-SMX therapy in all patients, from (mean +/- SD) 37.4 +/- 11% without TMP-SMX to 52.2 +/- 6.4% with TMP-SMX (p less than 0.01). Plasma clearance of total MTX did not change significantly, whereas clearance of free MTX decreased significantly (from 12.5 +/- 4 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05). There was a consistent decrease in the renal clearance of free MTX (from 12.1 +/- 6.8 to 5.6 +/- 2.4 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05). Elimination half-life of MTX was not affected significantly by TMP-SMX. There was a significant correlation between serum concentrations of TMP-SMX and the percentage of decrease in the renal clearance of free MTX (r = 0.91; p less than 0.05). These changes in protein binding and tubular clearance of MTX, caused by competition with TMP-SMX, result in a mean 66% increase in systemic exposure to MTX and may explain the myelotoxicity often observed with the coadministration of the two drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is one of the most common and important causes of morbidity associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The evaluation of ADC in clinical trials is significant not only because of the clinical impact of this syndrome, but also because of the value of measuring its cardinal features as an index of drug efficacy and because of its emerging role as a major clinical end point. The objectives of therapy include both prevention of ADC in the presymptomatic patient and alleviation of established disease. At present, the pathogenesis of ADC is incompletely understood in several critical aspects, particularly the processes underlying the clinical manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) HIV-1 infection and, further, how such processes are related to systemic disease. Consequently, it is not yet clear to what extent, or in which patients, it is necessary to achieve \"therapeutic\" drug levels within the CNS. Nevertheless, the assessment of ADC prevention and treatment relies principally on the complementary approach of neurological examination for diagnosis and neuropsychological testing for quantitative serial measurement of treatment effects. Additionally, surrogate markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may hold promise for objective, rapid assessment of treatment response and dose adjustment. Other measurements, including more routine CSF analysis, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological assessments, are used principally for differential diagnosis rather than for monitoring ADC status. Accumulating experience with available antiviral agents suggests that ADC can be effectively prevented and treated, at least for some period of time, and that assessment of this condition is indeed a valuable approach for measuring antiviral therapy.\r"

This paper describes an appropriate statistical approach for analyzing the clinical efficacy of new treatments in such studies. Confidence intervals for the relative efficacy of the new treatment vis-a-vis standard therapy are used to provide information required to determine whether the experimental treatment has an improved therapeutic index. Desirable properties of this approach include the ability to implement standard group sequential guidelines for early trial termination, the ability to use valid surrogates for hard clinical outcomes, and the availability of straightforward formulas for sample size calculations.\r"

The operation was first described in the third century A.D. writings of Soranus and before the turn of this century carried a very high surgical morbidity and mortality rate. With the technologic advances made during this century in both medical and surgical specialties, the operation has become quite safe, with a mortality rate of approximately 12/10,000 procedures. However, although it is possible to objectively measure the improved quality and increased quantity of life when hysterectomy is done for cancer treatment or other life-threatening conditions, it is difficult to so measure those parameters when hysterectomy is done solely to improve the quality of life. Today the physician's medical judgment and patient's understanding of the procedure are no longer the only criteria that have to be considered before surgery. Input by third-party payers, hospital administrators, quality assurance programs, second opinion programs and standards of practice in the geographic region also play a role. Also, alternatives to hysterectomy are being evaluated; in many circumstances they are being utilized today when hysterectomy would have been the treatment of choice before this decade.\r"

To determine if interleukin-1 (IL-1), a peritoneal macrophage product, has any effect on gamete interaction and early embryo development, human recombinant IL-1 was added to the coincubation of gametes in the sperm penetration assay (SPA), human zona pellucida assay (ZPPA) and culture medium (Ham's F-10) used for processing semen samples with the layering method, with analysis of velocity and motility after 24 hours. IL-1 was also added to mouse embryos (two cells) cultured for 72 hours. The results showed that IL-1 caused impairment of SPA and ZPPA when compared to control medium, without significant alterations in sperm velocity and motility. Also, IL-1 demonstrated significant inhibition of mouse embryo development. These results help explain subfertility associated with early stages of endometriosis.\r"

The affected groups were similar in demographic and other characteristics. Most were white and in their mid-20s.

All patients underwent a preoperative clinical evaluation and multichannel urodynamic testing. The clinical examination included a \"Q-tip\" test to determine the presence or absence of urethral hypermobility. Urethral hypermobility was defined as a maximal angle change of greater than or equal to 30 degrees from the horizontal, measured during straining or coughing in the lithotomy position. Thirty-four patients underwent repeat multichannel urodynamic testing three months postoperatively to determine the objective surgical success. Ninety-three percent of patients (27/29) with a positive preoperative Q-tip test were cured. Of patients with a negative preoperative Q-tip test, only 20% (1/5) were cured. Preoperative urethral hypermobility was a good prognostic indicator of operative success when a suburethral sling procedure was used to treat genuine stress incontinence and low urethral closure pressure.\r"

Fetal malpresentation, failure to progress and the patient's lack of desire for a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery were common reasons for the high cesarean rate (62/117, or 52%). The neonatal outcomes were favorable regardless of the route or interval between deliveries. Discordant fetal growth was found in only eight cases (6.8%). No perinatal deaths occurred, and five-minute Apgar scores less than 7 (2/234, or 0.9%) and rates of anomalies (5/234, or 2.1%) were not different from those in singleton pregnancies delivering during the same period. Using the principles of obstetric practice used in our community, we would expect the perinatal outcomes in term twin gestations to be favorable.\r"

  ".W": "From October 1984 to April 1986, 237 women who had had an earlier cesarean section underwent a trial of labor (TOL). The delivery outcomes for 87 who received epidural analgesia were compared retrospectively with those for the 150 who did not. There were no overt uterine ruptures. The rates were similar for successful TOL, uterine scar dehiscence, blood transfusions, endometritis and one- and five-minute Apgar scores. The rate of operative vaginal delivery was higher in the epidural group. When epidural subjects were divided into vaginal and cesarean delivery groups, the failed-TOL group differed from the successful-TOL group in greater maternal weight gain, heavier and longer infants, higher rate of oxytocin administration, less cervical dilation and higher station at epidural activation. When the oxytocin-treated subjects were excluded, however, the epidural and no-epidural patients had the same successful TOL rates (94% and 92%, respectively) and spontaneous vaginal delivery rates (70% and 76%, respectively). Epidural analgesia, when controlled for oxytocin use, appears to have no effect on the failed-TOL or operative vaginal delivery rate.\r"

All pregnancies were at term and had a cephalic presentation. Thirty-two women in the sample studied underwent a cesarean section for fetal distress. Using that end point, a screening FHR tracing in the admitting room had a sensitivity of 57%, specificity of 98%, positive predictive value of 75% and overall efficiency of 95%. One- and five-minute Apgar scores and thick meconium staining of the amniotic fluid were also examined. While no statistically significant differences were found (P less than .2 for Apgar score and less than .06 for meconium), there was a trend that might have been significant if more women had been studied. A screening FHR tracing on all women at term in the latent phase of labor will identify the majority of those who will develop fetal distress in labor. Women with an abnormal screening tracing should be admitted to the hospital and the fetal status evaluated further.\r"

In 1,241 nonstress tests (NSTs) there was a statistically significant difference in the number of reactive tests between the short and long criteria (1,108 [89%] vs. 985 [79%], P less than .001). This difference in percentage of reactivity may be important when comparing studies performed by various investigators. In comparing cesarean section deliveries for fetal distress we were unable to find a difference in the ability to predict a poor outcome between use of the short and long criteria. However, a type II error is possible since the number of poor outcomes was small. We now use the short criterion for NST interpretation.\r"

The hydrogel was deposited inside the vas lumen via a 22-gauge Teflon intercatheter. The solution gelled within 120 seconds. Semen was collected by manual collection and analyzed for volume, sperm count and viability. After occlusion with 150 microL of the polymer in the distal direction (direction of the testis), the volume of ejaculate (2.2 mL) did not change. Subsequent samples showed no viable or dead spermatozoa. The stained smears of the ejaculate showed the presence of cell debris, granulocytes and few epithelial cells. When the vas was injected with 50 microL of the polymer in either a distal or proximal direction, the occlusion effectiveness was 75% and 25%, respectively. In the proximal direction, granulomas were noticed in the vas wall where semen leaked through the injection port. Histology of successfully occluded vasa (with Hypan) showed no cellular reaction or fibrotic changes in the proximity of the polymer. For less than or equal to 20 weeks after vas occlusion, no evidence of abnormal morphology was found in the epididymal and testicular tissue. This highly biocompatible polymer solution, when gelled in contact with tissue fluid, offers safe and effective occlusion of the vas with the promise of reversibility.\r"

MDR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were elevated in 13 of 15 colorectal carcinoma specimens and in six of 13 gastric carcinoma specimens. Well-differentiated colorectal carcinomas contained significantly higher concentrations of MDR1 mRNA than moderately differentiated colorectal carcinomas. Similarly, moderately differentiated gastric carcinomas contained higher concentrations of MDR1 mRNA than poorly differentiated gastric carcinomas. MDR1 gene expression in normal colorectal and gastric tissues adjacent to carcinomas was similar to that in the carcinomas. MDR1 gene expression in xenografts of colorectal and gastric carcinomas in nude mice was also investigated. Elevated expression of the MDR1 gene was seen in only four of 18 xenografts of colorectal carcinoma and was not seen in any xenografts of gastric carcinoma. P-glycoprotein was distributed over the luminal surface of the colorectal carcinoma. These results imply that the higher levels of MDR1 mRNA found in well-differentiated carcinomas derived from colorectal tissues are the results of increased expression of the MDR1 gene in the luminal surface cells. The level of expression of the MDR1 gene in colorectal and gastric carcinomas appears to correlate with the degree of differentiation and also appears to be affected by transplantation into nude mice.\r"

Within each stage classification, lower levels of serum albumin and hemoglobin and higher relative body weight were more common among blacks and were independently associated with poorer survival. Among women with stage 3 disease, adjustment for these variables substantially reduced the excess mortality rate among blacks, suggesting that racial differences in survival may be partly explained by differences in nutritional status or extent of disease within stage.\r"

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, we document that administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen to patients with breast cancer was associated with a statistically significant (P = .002) reduction in the serum level of IGF-I. The mean IGF-I level was 1.4 U/mL in the placebo-treated group and 0.9 U/mL in the tamoxifen-treated group. Because serum IGF-I level is growth hormone (GH) dependent and because data suggest that the pubertal surge in GH and IGF-I levels is sex steroid dependent, we speculate that the mechanism underlying our observation may involve blockade by tamoxifen of estrogen action in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We conclude that tamoxifen treatment reduces IGF-I levels and that this reduction may contribute to the therapeutic effect of the drug.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with primary localized lung cancer were tested at the time of surgery for the ability of their lymphocytes to kill autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells, and the assay was evaluated for prognostic significance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 27 patients (54%) demonstrated significant autologous tumor-killing activity in 6-hour 51Cr-release assays. Twenty-three of the 27 patients with autologous tumor-killing activity remained tumor free and survived more than 5 years after curative surgery, while all 23 who were negative for autologous tumor-killing activity relapsed by 18 months after surgery and died within 42 months after surgery. The differences in survival curves for the two groups were highly significant (P less than .00003). Autologous tumor-killing activity was not correlated with natural killer (NK) cell activity against K562 human myeloid leukemia cells or proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated with autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells in mixed culture. There were no differences in total survival between patients with positive results and those with negative results in tests of NK cell activity and autologous mixed lymphocyte-tumor culture reaction. These results indicate that autologous tumor-killing activity is a meaningful prognostic indicator and provide evidence for immunological control of tumor growth and metastasis. According to our preliminary data, it is unlikely that lung cancer patients who remain tumor free after 60 months of follow-up will develop recurrence or die from the disease. We are conducting a study to determine whether induction of autologous tumor-killing activity before surgery, by treatment with biological response modifiers,can improve the clinical outcome in patients who do not naturally have this potential.\r"

We now report that both E2 and tamoxifen (TMX) significantly decreased the fluidity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 cellular membranes. With E2 or TMX at concentrations greater than 1 microM, perturbations in membrane fluidity were accompanied by apparently non-ER-mediated cytotoxicity.

In a phase I clinical study of LED, the maximum tolerated dose was 90 mg/m2 and dose-limiting toxicity was considered to have been reached when granulocytopenia was produced. We used LED to treat 20 patients with advanced, measurable breast cancer. LED was given at doses of 60-75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. Regression of disease was objectively measured in nine patients; in five of these patients, complete regression of the index lesion occurred. The mean duration of the responses was 7 months. Hematologic toxicity consisted of grade 1-2 leukopenia in some patients. Gastrointestinal toxicity and mucositis were generally mild and tolerable. Alopecia occurred in all patients and usually was complete. Twelve patients received cumulative doses of LED of greater than 400 mg/m2 and were evaluated with radionuclide ventriculograms. In eight patients, the cumulative dose was greater than 500 mg/m2, and five had endomyocardial biopsies. Four of these biopsy results were Billingham grade 0, while one (cumulative LED dose, 750 mg/m2) showed grade 1 changes with mild myofibrillar loss and dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum involving less than 5% of cardiac myocytes. Two patients had decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction. One of these patients had received a total dose of LED of 630 mg/m2 and had a decline of 13% in left ventricular ejection fraction, but had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure and had a Billingham grade 0 endomyocardial biopsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighteen patients were treated with doses of AZT ranging from 1.0 to 9.0 g/m2 per day. Nausea and vomiting were dose limiting, with a maximally tolerated dose of 7.5 g/m2 per day. Rash and mucositis occurred but were not dose limiting. A dose-related increase in peak plasma levels of AZT was observed, and the alpha half-life of AZT in plasma (75 min) was unaffected by these high doses. At doses above 4.0 g/m2 per day, trough levels significantly increased, perhaps reflecting prolonged absorption from the gut. No responses were observed; however, a significant increase in DNA single-strand breaks was observed in peripheral blood cells after a threshold dose of 4.0 g/m2 per day, confirming a biological effect of AZT in this regimen. Further trials with an intravenous formulation capable of maintaining plasma levels and circumventing dose-limiting toxicity are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Investigations using intermediate end points as cancer surrogates are quicker, smaller, and less expensive than studies that use malignancy as the end point. We present a strategy for determining whether a given biomarker is a valid intermediate end point between an exposure and incidence of cancer. Candidate intermediate end points may be selected from case series, ecologic studies, and animal experiments. Prospective cohort and sometimes case-control studies may be used to quantify the intermediate end point-cancer association. The most appropriate measure of this association is the attributable proportion. The intermediate end point is a valid cancer surrogate if the attributable proportion is close to 1.0, but not if it is close to 0. Usually, the attributable proportion is close to neither 1.0 nor 0; in this case, valid surrogacy requires that the intermediate end point mediate an established exposure-cancer relation. This would in turn imply that the exposure effect would vanish if adjusted for the intermediate end point. We discuss the relative advantages of intervention and observational studies for the validation of intermediate end points. This validation strategy also may be applied to intermediate end points for adverse reproductive outcomes and chronic diseases other than cancer.\r"

Total PKC activity was more than twofold higher in the EJ cells than in RT4 cells (superficial human bladder carcinoma cells), which do not pass through an artificial basement membrane. There was more PKC activity in the cytosol than in the membrane of EJ cells. Staurosporine, at nontoxic concentrations, inhibited the invasion of EJ cells through an artificial basement membrane in a dose-dependent manner. Staurosporine caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell motility but did not inhibit cell attachment. Staurosporine represents a new agent for the inhibition of tumor cell invasion and may prove useful in studying the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.\r"

Hybridomas secreting antibodies that bound specifically to L612 were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using L612 and three negative control human IgMs, including monoclonal anti-GM2 and anti-GD2 antibodies, as well as purified serum IgM, as antigen sources. GM3-binding inhibition and cell-binding inhibition assays were used to identify seven anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies that recognized determinants located within the antigen-combining sites of L612. To determine whether these anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies possessed the internal image of the original antigen, we immunized syngeneic BALB/c mice with one of the anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies, 4C10, coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Sera from the immunized mice reacted strongly with an antigen-positive M12 melanoma cell line and with purified GM3. Because L612 detects and kills melanoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in the presence of complement without affecting normal tissues, anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies carrying the internal image of GM3 may be an effective tool for active specific immunotherapy in patients with melanoma.\r"

The ability to place human cells in microcapsules with semipermeable membranes for implantation into test animals led to the development of this assay. The anti-HIV activity assay involves microencapsulating human T-lymphoblastoid cells sensitive to the cytopathic effects of HIV; the encapsulated cells are then implanted into athymic nude mice and recovered after drug treatment in vivo. A positive antiviral effect of the test substance is indicated by growth or survival of the virus-infected cells in the microcapsules. Several HIV-sensitive cell lines of T-lymphocyte, monocyte, and nonlymphocyte origin were examined for growth in microcapsules in vitro and in vivo. Light and electron microscopic analysis of the capsules and the human cells contained therein revealed the invasion of mouse immune cells and other adverse effects that could not be overcome by any of numerous technical modifications attempted. We conclude that cellular microencapsulation technology is not feasible for in vivo drug-testing protocols because of immunogenic reactions.\r"

Monosomy of chromosome 3 was seen in six patients (43%), five of which were associated with anomalies of chromosome 8. Increased dosage of parts of chromosome 8q and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3, or the combination of both, seemed to be nonrandom for uveal melanoma and may distinguish it genetically from cutaneous malignant melanoma. Anomalies of chromosome 6, mostly resulting in additional material of 6p or a deletion of 6q, were found in six patients (43%). These anomalies, which seem to be common features of cutaneous malignant melanoma, were considered secondary rather than primary changes in uveal melanoma, since they were present only in subclones in most cases. Loss of the Y chromosome, restricted to tumor cells, was detected in four male patients, and loss of one X chromosome was detected in a female patient.\r"

Of a total of 58 lesions detected in 31 patients, no neoplastic lesion greater than or equal to 10 mm in size was missed; 16% of diminutive (less than or equal to 5 mm) neoplastic polyps and 12.3% of medium-sized (6-9 mm) neoplastic polyps were missed by the first examiner. We conclude that an experienced colonoscopist will miss about 15% of colorectal neoplastic polyps less than 10 mm in size in the setting of adequate bowel preparation. Large (greater than or equal to 10 mm) polyps were rarely missed, however, with the \"miss\" rate in our study equal to 0, with a 95% confidence limit of 4.64%.\r"

The mutagen-hypersensitive patients, ie, those who expressed greater than 1.0 break per cell, were significantly more likely to develop multiple primary cancers than were patients who were less sensitive (less than or equal to 1.0 break per cell) (relative risk = 4.4; 95% confidence limits = 1.2, 15.8). This relationship was independent of age, sex, site, and treatment of first primary cancer and tobacco or alcohol exposures.

We evaluated 50 consecutive trauma patients for the presence of A-PEEP and its effect on hemodynamic stability. Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were 8 to 41 (21 +/- 1); Revised Trauma Scores (RTS) ranged from 2.0 to 7.8 (6.2 +/- 0.2). Mode of ventilation was assist control, inspiratory flow rates were 40 to 120 L/M (78 +/- 2). A-PEEP, determined in the non-assisting patient by occluding the expiratory port at end exhalation, was present in 28 patients (56%) and ranged from 1 to 12 cm H2O (5.3 +/- 0.4 cm H2O). Data segregated by A-PEEP versus no A-PEEP were as follows (Mean +/- SEM): [table: see text] *P less than 0.05, VE = minute ventilation, Paw = mean airway pressure. Upon reversal of A-PEEP in the eight patients with levels greater than 5 cm H2O, mean blood pressure rose from 90 +/- 17 to 102 +/- 22 mm Hg and central venous pressure fell from 13 +/- 5 to 7 +/- 5 mm Hg. A-PEEP was successfully treated in these eight patients by increasing peak flows, minimizing VE requirements and selective use of bronchodilators. In sum, the hypermetabolic ventilated trauma patient should be monitored routinely for this common phenomenon which may have profound cardiopulmonary effects in the setting of acute resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "Both endotoxin and a burn alone produce oxidant-induced tissue lipid peroxidation. The endotoxin response is due in large part to hydrogen peroxide. The combination of endotoxin after a burn results in an increased liver, but not lung, oxidant injury. Our purpose was to determine whether the burn oxidant injury inactivated endogenous liver tissue catalase, thereby amplifying a subsequent H2O2 insult. Twenty-six adult sheep were studied. Twelve sheep had a 15% TBS burn. Tissue catalase activity, measured in lung and liver 3 days postburn, was significantly decreased from a control of 3.58 +/- 1.8 and 193 +/- 63, respectively, to 1.72 +/- 0.63 and 148 +/- 33 k(sec-1)/0.5 gram tissue. The addition of endotoxin 3 days postburn resulted in an increase in liver malondialdehyde, MDA, a measure of lipid peroxidation, from a control of 110 +/- 80 to 450 +/- 54 nmol/gram tissue. This value was significantly greater than the 210 +/- 80 nmol/gram tissue seen after endotoxin alone. Lung tissue MDA with burn and endotoxin was 65 +/- 8 compared to 42 +/- 7 for control and 80 +/- 6 nmol/gram for endotoxin alone. We conclude that a decrease in liver catalase activity occurs after a burn. The decrease corresponds to an accentuated oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation after an added endotoxin insult where H2O2 is known to be an etiologic agent. The catalase activity also decreases in postburn lung, but accentuated lung damage was not seen, indicating a variable tissue response from the burn-induced decrease in antioxidant activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With scores greater than 25, the risk of postoperative complications became exponential. The purpose of the present study was to determine if: 1) the organ risk factors previously assigned were more statistically valid; and 2) the addition of physiologic variables would enhance the prediction of postinjury intra-abdominal sepsis. Fifteen abdominal organ systems and 17 physiologic variables in 300 consecutive patients were analyzed to determine ability to predict intraabdominal sepsis. There were no significant differences in predictive ability between the old and new organ risk factors. The addition of physiologic factors did not enhance the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. This clinical study demonstrates that: 1) the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis increases with increasing ATI score; 2) the previous (1979-initial) organ risk grading concept is statistically valid; 3) six of the 15 organ systems warrant a change in their relative rank order (1989-revision); 4) the addition of demographic, physiologic, and immunologic variables did not significantly improve the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis.\r"

From 1982 through 1987, 139 North American hospitals submitted demographic, etiologic, injury severity, and outcome data for 80,544 trauma patients. Motor vehicle related injuries were most frequent (34.7%). Twenty-one per cent of patients had penetrating injuries. The overall mortality rate was 9.0%. The mortality rate for direct admissions was strongly related to the presence of serious head injury, 5.0% and 40.0%, when head injuries were less than or equal to AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) 3 or greater than or equal to AIS 4, respectively. Survival probability norms use the Revised Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, patient age, and injury mechanism. Patients with unexpected outcomes were identified and statistical comparisons of actual and expected numbers of survivors made for each institution. Results provide a description of injury and outcome and support evaluation and quality assurance activities.\r"

  ".W": "Organ donor shortage is now the greatest limitation to the success of organ transplantation. To assess and compare the role of a regional trauma center in identifying and referring cadaveric organ donors to that of a community hospital, we retrospectively reviewed records of potential cadaveric organ donors during a comparable 5-year period in each. The trauma center (TC) contributed 44 donors, while the community hospital (CH) supplied seven. Five hundred sixty-five possible donors were not harvested at the TC, compared to 126 at the CH. While most \"non-donors\" from both institutions were not suitable candidates, 8% could have served as good organ donors. Inability to obtain consent was the major obstacle in obtaining good candidates (70% at CH, 83% at TC). Failure to recognize and refer possible donors occurred in 2% of the cases at CH, compared to 0.4% at the TC. We conclude that regional trauma centers can play an important role in alleviating organ donor shortage.\r"

We investigated the histamine release of basophil granulocytes from severely burned patients (n = 12) after stimulation with anti-IgE or the Ca-ionophore A 23187, respectively. The anti-IgE-induced basophil histamine release of all patients was reduced in comparison to healthy donors beginning at day one postburn (p.b.) (5.0 +/- 2.3% vs. 30.5 +/-3.4%), while the Ca-ionophore-induced release was not decreased before day two p.b. Basophils of patients who finally succumbed to their injuries showed poor responsiveness (to zero levels) over the total time. In contrast, the basophil releasability of surviving patients returned to nearly normal levels (fifth to seventh week p.b.). Already in the second week p.b. there was a significant difference in histamine release between survivors and nonsurvivors [e.g., days 6-9 p.b.: 23.7 +/- 4.0 vs. 6.9 +/- 2.7 (p less than 0.005) after Ca-ionophore stimulation]. The altered basophil histamine release was neither due to a diminished dose- or a delayed time-response to the stimuli nor due to differences in the basophil counts or the cellular histamine content. Our data indicate that the decrease of the basophil releasability, which may be secondary to altered signal transduction pathways in severely burned patients correlates with the clinical outcome.\r"

While the number of B-cells remained unchanged, B-cell proliferation induced by Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC) was normal or even enhanced at early and late phases postburn, but showed a marked suppression during the second to fourth week. A similar pattern was observed for the pokeweed mitogen (PWM)- or SAC-stimulated synthesis of immunoglobulin M (IgM), whereas IgG production was decreased over the whole postburn period monitored. Cytokine (interleukin 4)-induced B-cell activation as indicated by the expression of the CD23 surface antigen was impaired throughout the second to fifth week. In parallel, the release of the proteolytic cleavage product sCD23 which represents a B-cell growth and differentiation factor was reduced. Our data provide evidence that activation, proliferation, and differentiation processes of B-lymphocytes are impaired in severely burned patients, which may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to infection and sepsis.\r"

The goal of this study was to determine the long-term disabilities caused by bicycle-related injuries, and to clarify the long-term treatment priorities of injured children. Hospital records of 372 children (ages 2-15 yr, median 9 yr; 232 boys and 140 girls) admitted with bicycle-related injuries from 1979 through 1986 provided clinical information, social service visits, in-hospital and outpatient rehabilitative interventions, and physical status at discharge. More complete evaluations were made by contacting parents by telephone (82 children), and by personal interview and physical examinations (27). Head injuries predominated (69.1%). Twelve (3.2%) died, all from major head injuries. Four suffered permanent severe impairment from cervical spinal injuries and head injuries and remain institutionalized (1.4%). One third had a persistent disability noted at the time of discharge in the medical record (33.6%), reported by telephone interview (31.7%), or confirmed by physical examination (37.0%). Still, only 11.0% received physical therapy consultations during hospitalization, and 22.8% received social service assistance. Only 39.0% were seen by a surgeon or pediatrician after discharge, and few (7.3%) received outpatient physical therapy. Cognitive or behavior changes were noted in 31.7%, many noting changes in school performance (worse in 20.7%), behavior (13.4%), and sleep, particularly nightmares (34.1%). Recurrent injuries occurred in 52 children (14.4%), of whom ten (2.8%) required further hospital admission.

There was a total of five patients with injury to the parotid area: two patients with isolated facial nerve injury; one with isolated parotid duct injury; two with combined duct and nerve injury. There were four males and one female, with a mean age of 34 years (range, 16 to 62 years). The three patients with parotid duct injury required other procedures for associated trauma. A total of eight nerve branches were severed in four patients. Seven of the eight nerve branches (82.5%) were primarily repaired, with excellent functional results. Two of the three ductal injuries were repaired primarily over a stent, and one was ligated. No complications resulted from either treatment. Based on our clinical experience and review of the literature, we suggest that the treatment of parotid region injuries should include: 1) a complete initial assessment; 2) primary repair of parotid duct transection within 24 hours when possible; 3) primary repair of all facial nerve injuries, although delayed nerve repair remains a viable alternative; and 4) nonsurgical treatment of sialoceles and fistulae.\r"

The grading scheme is fundamentally an anatomic description, scaled from 1 to 5, representing the least to the most severe injury. We emphasize that these O.I.S.'s represent an initial classification system which must undergo continued refinement as clinical experience dictates.\r"

This paper will describe the epidemiologic, clinical, diagnostic, and prognostic features of the two eating disorders; a subsequent paper will examine theories of etiology and approaches to treatment, and discuss the special considerations that pertain when co-morbidity with substance abuse is indeed present.\r"

Indicators of nutritional status, consisting of anthropometric and hematologic data as well as demographic data, were obtained from a random sample of 130 clients in a New York City methadone treatment center. Subjects for this study were selected according to the entry criteria established for inclusion in a large-scale study of the role of nutritional factors and cell-mediated immunity in a group at high risk of HIV seropositivity. Our results indicate a larger than U.S. population-average heterogeneity for Body Mass Index, hematocrit, and hemoglobin concentration, parameters which are conventionally thought to be proxies for general nutritional status. The findings indicate that while some methadone treatment clients are at low nutritional risk, others are probably at very high risk of adverse drug-nutrient and drug-body habitus interactions as well as being at high risk of acquiring infections commonly associated with HIV-related immunodeficiency.\r"

The population reflected a higher belief that health status is more under their own control than under the control of chance or powerful others. However, the results indicated that recovering alcoholics with a more powerful other health orientation tended to maintain membership longer with Alcoholics Anonymous, would seek help sooner, would begin heavy drinking at a later age, and would attempt formal treatment more often.\r"

CES involves applying small amounts of electrical stimulation through electrodes applied to the skin surface over the cranium. The paper summarizes major theories (gate, endorphin, and Chinese acupuncture) which attempt to explain how CES may help alleviate drug withdrawal and craving. Two of the studies reviewed show that CES patients experienced more severe withdrawal during the early part of treatment than comparison groups of methadone patients. Other studies show that CES patients did better than methadone patients. The findings from all studies reviewed, however, were limited because of low participation rates, high dropout rates, difficulties in blinding subjects and evaluators, and the absence of standardized procedures and equipment. The evidence reviewed suggests that CES is a promising line of inquiry for continued efforts to develop nonchemical ways to detoxify opiate-dependent individuals. Improved research designs, larger sample sizes, more integrity in data collection, and improved data analysis are needed in the future.\r"

All but one of the individuals given buspirone HCl for alcohol detoxification completed that phase of treatment within six days in a manner which effectively controlled their withdrawal symptoms. The findings were suggestive of an important role for buspirone HCl in the detoxification of the alcohol-dependent patient using a pharmacologic agent other than traditional medications such as benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, beta blockers, magnesium sulphate, or clonidine.\r"

The abuse of these substances has since expanded to include junior high and high school male and female athletes and non-athletes. The anabolic and androgenic effects of these agents, when taken in the doses needed to produce increases in size and strength, result in significant serious adverse effects involving the skin, liver, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, endocrine and reproductive systems. Some of these effects are irreversible. It is essential that clinical toxicologists, emergency room physicians and psychiatrists are familiar with the physical and psychological effects, as well as the changes in laboratory parameters, that typically occur from chronic use of anabolic steroids. The toxicities and representative clinical profiles of steroid users are presented, and the methods available for diagnostic screening using psychological testing and urine analysis are also reviewed.\r"

Both patients had ingested enteric-coated iron preparations and both experienced significant, protracted abdominal pain. Thus adults as well as children are at risk for severe gastrointestinal complications after iron overdose. Significant protracted abdominal pain should alert the clinician of its possibility. Damage to distal areas of the bowel can occur with complete sparing of proximal portions particularly if the iron is an enteric-coated preparation.\r"

The goal of this prospective multi-center study was to develop a toxicity profile of initial signs and symptoms observed in fluoxetine overdose. A standardized data collection form was used on all patients ingesting fluoxetine as reported to four poison centers. Information obtained included age, dose, co-ingested drugs, presenting symptoms, vital signs, EKG abnormalities and lab values. Of the 127 cases of acute fluoxetine overdose collected, 106 cases met the criteria of the study. Of these, 69/106 ingested other drugs, including ethanol and 37/106 ingested fluoxetine alone. Of the latter group, the amounts ingested ranged from 20 to 1500 mg. It was observed that 48.6% (18/37) remained asymptomatic, 16.2% (7/37) were sleepy, 24.3% (9/37) had a sinus tachycardia (of 100 beats per minute or greater), and 8.1% (3/37) had a diastolic pressure over 100 mm Hg. Data collection is ongoing. Based upon our initial experience, fluoxetine in overdose appears to be relatively benign.\r"

In a randomized double-blind study, 18 patients (group 1) and eight patients (group 2) with suspected benzodiazepine overdose received 5 mg (group 1) or 1 mg (group 2) flumazenil or placebo, respectively. The stage of coma, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were monitored within the following 15 min. If no change in the stage of coma was observed, 5 mg (group 1) or 1 mg (group 2) flumazenil were given, and the stage of coma, heart rate and blood pressure were again monitored. In a similar way, the effect of 5 and 1 mg flumazenil was investigated in 13 patients (group 3) and four patients (group 4) with ethanol intoxication. In an open trial, the clinical efficacy of flumazenil for the diagnosis of benzodiazepine or ethanol overdose was studied in 29 patients (group 5). In all patients, a toxicological screening confirmed benzodiazepine or ethanol overdose. None of the patients receiving placebo showed effects on stage of coma, heart rate, blood pressure or respiratory rate. Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. The effect of 1 mg flumazenil (group 2) on benzodiazepine-induced coma was less pronounced. In patients with ethanol overdose (group 3), ethanol-induced coma was reversed after 5 mg flumazenil more slowly than in patients of group 1. No effect of flumazenil on ethanol-induced coma was observed in group 4. In group 5, flumazenil proved to be useful for diagnosing benzodiazepine or ethanol intoxication. In one patient with coma due to carbamazepine overdose, flumazenil was also found to be effective. Additionally, a possible analytical interference of flumazenil and its metabolites with the identification of other benzodiazepines by a toxicological screening procedure was studied. Even after an oral dose of 200 mg flumazenil, no interference with immunological benzodiazepine assays (EMIT, TDX, and RIA) was found. A metabolite and an artifact of flumazenil could be identified in urine by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.\r"

An operation is essential for case selection and evaluation of local response but it also contributes to bladder preservation and survival. The procedure that is necessary to select for and assess response to chemotherapy may itself alter the actual or proceed to evolution of invasive bladder cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable therapeutic strategy in selected patients but it remains to be seen whether the results will prove to be superior to those achieved with standard endoscopic and open operations.\r"

In 53.8% of the cases, there were 3 large venous trunks and in 28.8% there were 2 venous trunks joining to form the main renal vein. Intrarenal veins demonstrated free anastomoses that were disposed in 3 systems of longitudinal arcades (stellate, arcuate and interlobar veins). There were large venous collars around caliceal necks and also horizontal arches crossing over calices to link anterior and posterior veins. In 84.6% of the cases the upper caliceal group was encircled anteriorly and posteriorly by venous plexuses, which coursed parallel to the infundibulum. In 50.0% of the cases the lower caliceal group also was enriched by 2 venous plexuses. A close relationship existed between a large inferior tributary of the renal vein and the anterior aspect of the ureteropelvic junction in 40.4% of the cases. In 69.2% of the cases there was a posterior (retropelvic) vein: in 48.1% this vein had a close relationship to the junction of the pelvis with the upper calix and in 21.1% it crossed the middle posterior surface of the renal pelvis.\r"

Renal artery stenosis was due to fibrous dysplasia in 17 patients and atherosclerosis in 36. The reasons for failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were inability to dilate the stenotic lesion (32 patients), acute renal arterial occlusion (2) or dissection (8) from attempted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and the development of recurrent renal artery stenosis after initially successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (11). Three patients underwent nephrectomy due to the finding of a nonviable kidney at operation. Successful surgical revascularization was achieved in 50 patients. There was no significant fibrosis or inflammation around the previously dilated renal artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty necessitated performance of a more complicated revascularization operation in only 1 patient. If the kidney is viable at operation in patients treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty renovascular reconstruction is not more technically difficult than when done primarily and the same excellent results can be achieved.\r"

Preoperative diagnostic studies included magnetic resonance imaging in all patients, inferior venacavography in 16 and computerized tomography scanning in 15. All patients underwent an operation in which the presence and extent of the vena caval thrombus were confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately delineated the presence and extent of the thrombus in all 20 patients (100%). Venacavography was accurate in 15 patients (94%) but 8 (50%) required a retrograde and antegrade study. Computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of a tumor thrombus in all 15 patients but accurately delineated the cephalad extent of the thrombus in only 5 (33%). In patients with vena caval tumor thrombi magnetic resonance imaging can provide accurate information regarding the extent of vena caval involvement while avoiding the need for an invasive contrast imaging study.\r"

The Leadbetter-Politano technique of ureteroneocystostomy was used in the first 160 patients (group 1) and an anterior extravesical technique modified from the methods of Witzel, Sampson and Lich was performed in the second 160 patients (group 2). Urological complications occurred in 15 patients (9.4%) in group 1 and 6 (3.7%) in group 2 (p = 0.04). Ureterovesical junction obstruction occurred in 6 patients (3.7%) in group 1 and 1 (0.6%) in group 2 (p = 0.05). Complications of leakage, ureteral necrosis and ureteral stricture were comparable in the 2 groups. Therefore, we advocate the use of the anterior extravesical technique over Leadbetter-Politano ureteral reimplantation based on the lower incidence of urological complications and various technical advantages, including less operative time, avoidance of a separate cystotomy, less hematuria and ability to use short donor ureters.\r"

After a mean observation of 14 years 7 months (1 to 46 years) 64.5% of the patients had bilaterally normal kidneys without any previous complications, 77.5% of the renal units being normal. Sigmoidoscopic biopsy revealed 3 carcinomas at the ureterocolonic junction resulting in an 8.5 to 10.5-fold increased risk of colon carcinoma compared to the general population. The excretion of nitrite and N-nitrosamines was increased, and nitrate excretion was decreased compared to healthy control volunteers, suggesting endogenous formation of nitrosamines by bacterially reduced nitrate and endogenous amines. The urological long-term results of ureterosigmoidostomy are similar to those of conduits. However, the increased incidence of colon carcinoma is not yet proved to be higher than in conduits.\r"

Of the specimens 10 (26%) were deoxyribonucleic acid diploid, 8 (21%) were tetraploid and 20 (53%) were aneuploid. Distribution of ploidy patterns between the 14 histological low grade and 24 high grade tumors was similar. Of 38 tumors 35 (92%) showed muscle invasion. One tumor arose in a previously exstrophied bladder, 10 were of urachal origin and 27 arose in an anatomically normal bladder. Of the urachal origin tumors 80% were deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploid. At 5 and 10 years after diagnosis 80 and 70%, respectively, of the patients with diploid tumors were free of disease. By contrast, at 5 and 10 years after treatment only 20 and 12%, respectively, of the patients with nondiploid tumors have not had disease progression (p less than 0.001 log-rank test). None of the 6 patients with diploid, high grade, high stage, muscle invasive tumors had subsequent progression. In contrast, 16 of 17 patients (94%) with high grade, high stage, nondiploid tumors had either local or distant tumor recurrence (p less than 0.0005). Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern appears to be the most significant prognostic information currently available to stratify expected prognosis for patients with muscle invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder. This test probably should be a standard tool in the clinical management of patients with this rare bladder malignancy.\r"

Among evaluable patients with measurable disease response rates were 3 of 22 (14%, 95% confidence interval 5 to 35%) for carboplatin and 4 of 25 (16%, 95% confidence interval 5 to 36%) for CHIP.

Median survival for 64 evaluable patients was 4.8 months (5.0 months for carboplatin and 4.3 months for CHIP recipients). Independent factors prognostic for survival (p less than 0.01) were performance status (0 or 1 versus 2 or 3), liver metastases, prior radiation therapy and recent weight loss (p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed that a performance status of 2 or 3 and liver metastases were predictive of shorter survival. A total of 31% of the patients treated with carboplatin and 34% of those who received CHIP experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression. While the response rates with carboplatin and CHIP are modest, we believe that the characteristics of these agents indicate that they should be evaluated further.\r"

Of the 76 patients 2 (2.6%) had positive surgical margins (dome of the bladder and left ureter) and neither had positive margins at the site of nerve-sparing modifications. Of 3 patients (3.9%) who had local recurrence none had positive surgical margins. The 5-year actuarial local recurrence rate is 7.5%. Thirteen of 76 patients (17%) died of transitional cell carcinoma and 7 (9%) died of other causes, while 53 (70%) are alive without evidence of disease with a mean followup of 38.4 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rates are 64% over-all, 68% without disease and 78% disease-specific. Of the 42 evaluable men who underwent cystoprostatectomy alone 27 (64%) are potent, compared to 2 of the 12 men (17%) who also underwent urethrectomy. We conclude that the nerve-sparing modifications do not compromise cancer control, that local recurrence and survival rates are at least comparable to those achieved with standard radical cystoprostatectomy, and that it is possible to preserve potency in most men undergoing this procedure.\r"

Arteriographic studies of 104 other impotent patients also were reviewed and compared. Patients with persistent impotence immediately after blunt pelvic and perineal trauma had significantly different patterns of arteriographically demonstrated occlusive disease within the distal hypogastric-cavernous arterial bed consistent with the site of the traumatic injury. Those who sustained blunt pelvic trauma and complained of immediate impotence revealed arterial occlusive lesions mainly in the internal pudendal, common penile, cavernous and dorsal arteries. The incidence of arterial lesions in the distal internal pudendal or common penile artery was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in patients with blunt pelvic trauma (92%) than in those with blunt perineal trauma (35%). Patients who sustained blunt perineal trauma and complained of immediate impotence demonstrated a more focal pattern of pathological arterial occlusion primarily in the cavernous and dorsal arteries. The incidence of a solitary arterial lesion in the cavernous artery without proximal disease was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in patients with blunt perineal trauma (48%) than in those with blunt pelvic trauma (8%). It is hypothesized that blunt trauma without immediate impotence may be a potential risk factor for later development of arterial vasculogenic impotence, and that unrecognized or seemingly innocuous trauma may be a factor in cases of idiopathic impotence. Patients without trauma and with vascular risk factors have a more diffuse pattern of arteriographically demonstrated arterial lesions.\r"

To address this question we performed a retrospective review of all cases of testicular cancer during an 11-year period. Of 140 patients 6 had human immunodeficiency virus infection and 7 were from human immunodeficiency virus risk groups. All cases were either stage I or II disease with seminoma in 8, teratocarcinoma in 3, embryonal cell carcinoma in 1 and teratoma in 1. The clinical presentations of these patients were comparable to those of patients without human immunodeficiency virus risk factors. The majority of the patients received standard therapy, including orchiectomy followed by lymphadenectomy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy depending on stage and pathological subtype. Patients tolerated therapy well with only 1 course of radiation therapy complicated by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. All patients achieved complete remission and none died of testicular cancer. Since treatment of these patients may worsen the immunosuppression, surveillance is recommended after orchiectomy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with stage I disease. However, the majority of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection should receive standard therapy.\r"

The technique was a modified bilateral dissection via a thoracoabdominal approach. A full bilateral dissection was done above the level of the inferior mesenteric artery but unilateral dissection was performed below the inferior mesenteric artery using a template method. Of the 85 patients 64 had pathological stage A and 21 had stage B1 disease. Relapses have occurred in 4 of 64 stage A cancer patients (6%) and 3 of 21 stage B1 cancer patients (15%). Antegrade ejaculation was preserved without pharmacological therapy in 75 of 85 patients (88%) and 5 others were converted to antegrade ejaculation with imipramine. Therefore, 80 of 85 patients (94%) have recovered antegrade ejaculation. With a median followup of 38 months 7 relapses have been noted. We conclude that modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection allows for preservation of ejaculation, decreases concern about retroperitoneal understaging and represents the preferred alternative to surveillance protocols for patients with low stage testicular cancer.\r"

Considering prostatic adenocarcinoma patient populations, patients with metastases (groups 3 and 4) statistically differed from those without metastases (group 2). Furthermore, red blood cell polyamine level determination discriminated patients in the hormonal escape group (group 4) from those usually considered as hormone responsive (groups 2 and 3). No statistically significant correlation was observed between red blood cell polyamine levels and usual tumor markers (prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen). These results confirmed that red blood cell polyamine levels must be considered as a circulating index of cell proliferation that might be of clinical importance during the long-term followup and treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma patients.\r"

  ".U": "91039545\r", 
  ".W": "Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen correlates well with morphometrically determined prostate tumor volume in prostatectomy specimens. However, since prostate specific antigen is produced by hyperplastic as well as malignant prostatic epithelium, the contribution of hyperplastic epithelium (benign prostatic hyperplasia) to serum prostate specific antigen interferes with the ability of serum prostate specific antigen to predict tumor volume in individual patients. We wondered if the removal of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue would increase the correlation between prostate specific antigen and tumor volume, and, thus, make prostate specific antigen a more accurate predictor of residual cancer volume after transurethral resection of the prostate. A total of 67 patients with clinical stage A cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (22, or 33%, with stage A1 and 45, or 67%, with stage A2 disease), and had pre-radical prostatectomy measurement of serum prostate specific antigen and morphometric determination of residual cancer volume in the radical prostatectomy specimen. The correlation between serum prostate specific antigen and residual cancer volume for all 67 patients was 0.66, and for stages A1 and A2 disease it was 0.64 and 0.70, respectively. All stage A1 cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of 1 ng./ml. or less had residual tumor volumes of less than 0.5 cc and all stage A cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of more than 10 ng./ml. had residual tumor volumes of greater than 0.5 cc. Of the patients 51% had levels of 1 to 10 ng./ml. and serum prostate specific antigen was not useful to predict residual tumor volume in this group. Serum prostate specific antigen measurements may be helpful in stage A1 cancer patients with levels of 1 ng./ml. or less, or greater than 10 ng./ml. in choosing the most appropriate therapy.\r"

To test the hypothesis that low urinary Tamm-Horsfall protein excretion rates predispose to urinary tract infection we obtained serial urine samples from 17 women with and 18 without a history of recurrent urinary tract infection. None of the women had known structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. Concentrations of Tamm-Horsfall protein in urine were measured with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. On the average, 3 urine samples per person collected within 3 to 6 months were analyzed. The mean Tamm-Horsfall protein excretion of women with recurrent urinary tract infection was 57.0 mg./l. and that of controls was 66.3 mg./l.; this difference was not statistically significant. The mean coefficient of variation was 44.2 and 62.1%, respectively. We conclude that urinary Tamm-Horsfall protein concentration is not significantly decreased in women with recurrent urinary tract infection compared with controls, and that excretion varies widely in repeat samples obtained from the same individual.\r"

The major difficulty in fashioning the stoma is everting the mucosa over the intestinal mesentery. We describe our method of stoma formation that creates a circumferentially symmetrical protruding stoma free of tension that has been used successfully even in obese patients. This technique has made the use of a Turnbull stoma unnecessary in our recent experience.\r"

The seromuscular layers on each side of the incision are closed together with continuous 3-zero polyglycolic acid suture. The overlying outer mucosa of both edges then is closed.

The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder. Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability. In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding. Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier. All of these advantages greatly facilitate voiding.\r"

The plug is made of thermoplastic elastomer (Kraton G), and consists of a meatal plate, a soft stalk and 1 or 2 spheres along the stalk. The spheres were located according to the result of the urethral pressure profile. The midpoint of the proximal sphere was placed at the bladder neck and the distal sphere was placed just above the maximum urethral pressure point. At voiding the plug was removed and afterwards a new plug was inserted. The plug with 2 spheres was tested in week 1 (period 1) and the plug with only the distal sphere was tested in week 2 (period 2). A total of 22 patients completed period 1. Eight patients did not complete period 2, mostly due to either unchanged incontinence during period 1 or a repeated loss of the plug with 1 sphere. In periods 1 and 2, 73 and 79% of the patients were subjectively and objectively continent or improved. A total of 14 patients completed both periods. Eight patients preferred the plug with 2 spheres, 1 preferred the other plug and 5 had no preference. The side effects were few. This preliminary study shows that the urethral plug seems to be a promising alternative treatment for female genuine urinary stress incontinence.\r"

Recently the role of bladder dysfunction in the pathophysiology of renal function impairment and urinary incontinence after valve ablation has been questioned. From 1976 to 1986 we treated 50 male newborns with posterior urethral valves at our institution. Initial treatment in all cases consisted of bladder drainage by a urethral catheter, and correction of existing fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Subsequent treatment was dictated by the degree of upper tract abnormalities and it included valve ablation alone in 24 patients, vesicostomy and later valve ablation in 8, valve ablation and later upper tract reconstruction in 14 and cutaneous ureterostomy in 4. Followup ranges from 2 to 12 years (mean 6.8). Long-term renal functional impairment was related to the serum creatinine at age 1 year. If the serum creatinine was below 1.0 mg.% all patients (31) had normal values at long-term followup and if it was greater than 1.0 mg.% (19) then only 7 patients had normal values at followup. Urinary continence was assessed in 42 patients and it was normal in 34 (81%). The etiology of incontinence in the remaining 8 patients was bladder dysfunction in 6 and sphincter incompetence in 2. Those patients with urinary incontinence also had a high incidence of upper tract abnormalities (6 of 8, 75%) compared to continent valve patients (10 of 34, 29%).\r"

  ".W": "Rhabdomyosarcoma of the urogenital tract is a malignant mesenchymal tumor seen primarily in childhood. Multimodal therapy, encompassing surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has dramatically improved the survival of patients with this disease. However, the quest for markers of tumor aggression is important to decrease the morbidity of treatment given to patients with good prognosis tumors, while at the same time intensifying treatment of tumors with poor prognosis. Using archival tumor specimens from 13 patients with genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma, a multivariate analysis of multiple nuclear shape descriptors was done with the Hopkins Morphometry System. Three nuclear shape descriptors clearly separated patients with no evidence of disease recurrence or progression from those with recurrent disease, progressive disease or death of disease. These nuclear shape descriptors were standard error of the chain code standard deviation analysis (p = 0.010), range of the feret ellipticity distribution (p = 0.016) and standard error of the chain code range analysis (p = 0.037). With multivariate analysis these shape descriptors taken together separated patients with good and poor prognoses to a level of significance of p = 0.007. Thus, nuclear morphometric analysis may prove to be useful as an individual prognostic indicator in childhood genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma and warrants further analysis in a much larger, blinded, controlled study.\r"

The management of testicular lymphoma requires radical orchiectomy and prophylactic irradiation of the contralateral testis. Chemotherapy is indicated for advanced disease and may prevent relapses in patients with early disease. The role of central nervous system prophylaxis is controversial.\r"

  ".W": "To improve the quality of bladder contractions induced by parasympathetic stimulation and to facilitate the initiation of voiding, we investigated the effect of sympathetic stimulation on the parasympathetic innervation of the bladder in 12 dogs. For the sympathetic system, the lumbar sympathetic trunks were electrically stimulated; for the parasympathetic system, either the pelvic nerve or the ventral root of S2 was stimulated. With voltages at or just above the threshold for achieving a measurable effect on bladder pressure, stimulation of the sympathetic system or the pelvic nerve alone did not lead to voiding, and sacral root stimulation alone elicited voiding in only 7.4 per cent of stimulations. However, when the same stimulus parameters were used for synchronous stimulation, the voiding process was facilitated when sympathetic stimulation was begun five to 10 seconds before parasympathetic stimulation. When the pelvic nerve was used, voiding resulted in 77.7 per cent of stimulations and the bladder was emptied by a mean of 68.7 per cent; with S2 ventral root stimulation, voiding resulted in 83.3 per cent of stimulations and the bladder was emptied by 59.7 per cent. The facilitory effect of sympathetic stimulation was not abolished when the sympathetic trunks were cut centrally to the point of stimulation, but was absent when the hypogastric nerves were transected. We feel that sympathetic stimulation modulates the parasympathetic innervation of the bladder.\r"

The mechanical properties of the urethra were found to vary significantly as a function of time after induction of a cross-sectional area (stress episode) in both groups of women. The pattern of response of the urethra showed significant differences between normals and GSI particularly during dynamic conditions. Our results indicate that mechanical laxity of the urethra at the bladder neck and midurethrally especially at dynamic events (stress episodes) is of pathophysiological importance in GSI.\r"

Prostatic tissue was obtained from men with subtle palpable prostate nodules undergoing transperineal needle biopsy. None of the patients were shown to have histologic evidence of adenocarcinoma. The severity of the symptoms of prostatism was evaluated prospectively using a standardized micturition symptom score questionnaire. Norepinephrine levels were quantified using a sensitive radioenzymatic assay (REA). Overall, the prostates contained relatively high levels of norepinephrine (1666 +/- 124 ng./gm.). Inverse correlations were observed between tissue norepinephrine levels and severity of symptoms of prostatism (r = -0.58; p = 0.003); age (r = -0.53; p = .008); and prostate size (r = -0.48; p = .02). Norepinephrine levels were also measured in tissue specimens obtained from men undergoing enucleation prostatectomy and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The level of norepinephrine in these prostatectomy specimens (115 ng./gm.) was only 14% the level of the prostate biopsy specimens. The relatively low level of norepinephrine in the specimens obtained from patients with symptoms necessitating prostatectomy provides further evidence that norepinephrine levels are inversely related to the degree of symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction.\r"

Micturition profiles showed a marked decrease of the mean and maximal micturition volume and an increase in number of micturitions as early as one day after treatment. The micturition profile gradually normalized between four and eight weeks after instillation. In vivo cystometry showed a very small bladder capacity and low compliance during the first week following instillation, and gradually recovered to control levels by four weeks. Functional studies using the in vitro whole bladder model showed a significant decrease in the ability of the bladder to generate pressure and to empty at three days after instillation. These parameters recovered partially by two weeks, and completely by four weeks. Chemical cystitis induced by intravesical acetone instillation resulted in a severe decrease in the bladder function, i.e. contracted bladder with low compliance and poor ability to generate pressure and empty. However, these changes were reversible within the two month period of study.\r"

An in vivo study in animal and human subjects was performed to gain experience with the effect of intracavernosal trazodone. In the anesthetized New Zealand White rabbit, intracavernosal trazodone or its major metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) produced full penile erection in 76% and 84% of animals studied respectively with doses ranging from one to 15 mg. On the other hand, intracavernosal administration of five mg. papaverine resulted in a prolonged erection in 90% of animals studied. In 13 selected volunteer patients, intracavernosal trazodone caused tumescence but not full penile erection with corporal body pressures of 28.2 +/- 5.8 mm. Hg. Intracavernosal papaverine or papaverine and phentolamine in these subjects resulted in significantly higher corporal body pressures of 58 +/- 18 mm. Hg (p less than .05). Intracavernosal administration of alpha adrenoceptor agonists but not normal saline resulted in complete detumescence of trazodone- or m-CPP-induced prolonged erection in the animal studies. Intracavernosal trazodone results in erectile activity that appears in part based on its local alpha blocking activity but like other intracavernosal alpha-blocking agents is not as effective in initiating penile erections as are intracavernosal agents that directly induce smooth muscle relaxation.\r"

Lower levels of anti-A and AN43 binding on cultured cells were observed than are seen on urothelial cells in sections of normal ureter, while the binding of anti-blood group H, 5G6.4, and URO-5 was unchanged. Binding of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody 425 was improved if the cells were grown in medium lacking epidermal growth factor.

Upon challenge with ovalbumin, bladder tissue contracted 64 +/- 4% (mean +/- S.E.M.) of the maximum carbachol contraction and released 14.1 +/- 1.6% of the total tissue histamine content. Incubation of sensitized bladder tissue with indomethacin led to an increased force and duration of the contraction while incubation with nordihydroguaiaretic acid combined with pyrilamine reduced histamine release and abolished the contraction. Tissue histamine content was significantly higher in the bladder neck than in the dome, and significantly elevated following sensitization. Histochemical studies of bladder tissue demonstrated mast cell degranulation in antigen challenge experiments. In addition, a group of guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin through bladder instillations. With this model, study of the functional characteristics of bladder mast cells and the acute actions of mast cell products on the bladder microenvironment, should now be feasible.\r"

Rather than being maladaptive, hyperfiltration appropriately compensates for the loss of functional renal mass. Accordingly, most kidney donors can be expected to maintain a stable level of renal function without proteinuria or hypertension. Essential to this is proper selection of donors for nephrectomy and exclusion of high risk potential donors, bearing in mind the fact that apparently healthy, asymptomatic relatives of end stage renal disease patients are prone to the same disease processes that inflict the general population and have a higher risk of underlying renal disease.\r"

One man with severe debility and the organic brain syndrome died acutely with a fever of 40 C. Two men had frank sepsis that progressed to multiorgan failure and death. Sepsis progressed despite the use of isoniazid, rifampin and streptomycin. Two men who had equally progressive sepsis with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin survived with the use of cycloserine for the first 72 hours of treatment. Triple antituberculous antibiotics, including cycloserine, may be lifesaving. Sepsis resulted from intravenous absorption through inflamed or disrupted urothelium.

  ".W": "Most publications citing the effectiveness of renal extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy have used plain abdominal radiography to assess residual calculi after treatment. We compared radiologist sensitivity and specificity in the detection of calculi on plain abdominal radiographs versus conventional film-screen and digital renal tomograms in extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy patients. Of the patients 50 were imaged before and within 24 hours after lithotripsy. Six radiologists evaluated the resultant 300 studies for the presence and location of calculi. The mean sensitivity for digital tomograms was 83% for pre-lithotripsy and post-lithotripsy studies, which was significantly higher than for plain abdominal radiography and conventional tomography after lithotripsy. However, there were significantly more false positive stone diagnoses associated with digital tomogram interpretation. Signal detection analysis verified the over-all superiority of digital tomography for post-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy imaging. Calculus detection by conventional and digital tomography is superior to detection by plain abdominal radiography. However, because we did not perform delayed imaging, it is not possible to say what impact digital tomography might have on the management of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy patients.\r"

Patient age ranged from 4 to 35 years (mean age 20 years). The patients were divided into 2 groups. In group 1 (10 patients, 2 of whom required retransplantation) the ureter of the transplanted kidney was implanted into an ileal (7) or colonic (1) conduit or enterocystoplasty (2). In group 2 (7 patients, 1 of whom required a second transplant) the diversion was taken down and the transplanted ureter was implanted into the defunctionalized bladder. There were 14 living related and 6 cadaveric kidneys transplanted. Graft survival rates were 58 and 87% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, with an over-all rate of 70% (14 of 20 kidneys). There was no statistical difference in the graft survival rate between the 2 groups. The complications in group 1 included ureteroileal anastomotic leak (3 patients), ureteroileal stenosis (1), calculus formation (1), urosepsis (1), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (1), and wound infection and dehiscence (1). There were no complications in group 2. Renal transplantation into a pre-existing urinary intestinal conduit or augmented bladder does not statistically adversely affect patient or graft survival. However, the complication rate is much higher when the ureter is implanted into an intestinal segment. Therefore, it is preferable whenever possible to implant the ureter into the native bladder.\r"

Complete tumor resection with adequate preservation of renal function was accomplished in all cases. Of the 9 patients 5 had no evidence of disease 7 to 93 months (mean 33.2 months) postoperatively. The remaining 4 patients died of metastatic renal cell carcinoma 17 to 47 months (mean 35.5 months) postoperatively, 2 of whom had concomitant local recurrences in the renal remnant. Based on previously reported results of total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma with venous involvement and the morbidity associated with renal replacement therapy, we believe that a nephron-sparing operation is a viable option in the management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy has proved to be efficacious in the treatment and prophylaxis against tumor recurrence of superficial bladder tumors, its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Previous work has suggested that bacillus Calmette-Guerin organisms attach to the matrix protein, fibronectin, during fibrin clot formation at sites of urothelial disruption and that this attachment was required for the antitumor effect of bacillus Calmette-Guerin to be expressed. Furthermore, drugs inhibiting clot formation were found to abrogate the antitumor effect of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in a murine bladder tumor model. To examine the effect of inhibitors of fibrin clot formation on the results of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy, a retrospective analysis of 149 evaluable patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin for superficial bladder tumors was performed. The over-all response rate free of tumor for 29 patients who concomitantly received inhibitors of fibrin clot formation with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy was 48%, as compared with 67% for 120 patients who were not receiving these medications (p = 0.0655, chi-square). The most striking difference was noted for patients who failed with recurrent superficial disease. Of the patients who received fibrin clot inhibitors during intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy 35% had recurrent superficial tumors compared to only 8% of those who did not receive these drugs during a mean followup of 29.8 plus or minus 11 months (p = 0.005, chi-square). Our study suggests that inhibitors of fibrin clot formation may have an adverse influence on the results of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for superficial bladder tumors.\r"

Since the ratio of the prostacyclin concentration to the thromboxane A2 concentration is constantly maintained in normal hemostatic responses, an imbalance between thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin may be a factor to initiate vascular diseases and decrease blood flow. We assess the usefulness of the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio in penile blood during erection for diagnosis of arteriogenic impotence. The ratio in the arteriogenic impotence group was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than in the psychogenic and venogenic impotence groups. Therefore, the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio seems to be useful to diagnose arteriogenic impotence.\r"

Approximately 40% of the patients found pain, bending, ability for intercourse and over-all effects to be unchanged during the course of the disease.

Analysis of patterns of failure showed chronic bladder atony, prostate asymmetry and middle lobe configuration as important factors that could explain the failure of hyperthermia in 3 patients. Toxicity was mild, consisting of bladder spasms, perineal pain, dysuria and hematuria. Hyperthermia-induced pathological changes in prostatic tissues, causing periurethral shrinking and secondary dilatation of the prostatic urethra, are described. The reported clinical results of this phase I study are preliminary due to the short followup. A phase II study to optimize transurethral hyperthermia currently is underway.

The dose of terazosin was titrated to 5 mg. per day for a 1-month interval, provided adverse drug reactions were not observed. Of the patients 39 (87%) completed the dose titration study. The parameters used to assess the effectiveness of terazosin included peak and mean urinary flow rates, micturition symptom scores and the global assessment by the patient of symptomatic improvement. Over-all, the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures changed by less than 1%. The peak and mean urinary flow rates increased by 42 and 48%, respectively. The obstructive and irritative symptom scores improved by 63 and 35%, respectively. Over-all, 30 of the 45 participants (67%) indicated that the voiding symptoms were markedly improved while on terazosin. Five patients did not complete the dose titration study due to development of adverse drug reactions, including erectile dysfunction (7%), tiredness (7%), light-headedness (4%), palpitations (4%), nasal congestion (2%) and asymptomatic hypotension (2%). There were 25 patients (55%) followed on terazosin for 4 to 10 months (mean 6.5 months). The improvements in urinary flow rates and symptom scores were maintained for this interval. Although this preliminary experience with terazosin is encouraging, the ultimate role of terazosin for the long-term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia needs further evaluation.\r"

These findings present a high incidence of granuloma formation in patients treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The duration of therapy is a determinant factor in the induction of granuloma type.\r"

  ".U": "91039611\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer we reviewed the first 77 such patients in our series since we adopted the nerve-sparing technique. A total of 47 patients (61%) underwent bilateral and 26 (34%) underwent unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy, while in 4 (5%) both neurovascular bundles were resected. Among the patients followed for 12 months 27 of 41 (66%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 19 (37%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy had potency preserved. With the strict clinicopathological criteria of organ-confined tumor, that is intracapsular tumor with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels, complete tumor excision was achieved in 17 patients (36%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 26 (27%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy. All patients in whom both neurovascular bundles were resected had pathological stage C or D1 disease. Of the 24 patients who had complete tumor excision by the strict criteria only 15 (19.5% of the 77 preoperatively potent patients) had potency preserved. Of these patients 19 had microscopically positive margins without seminal vesicle invasion (pathological stage C1) with undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels. In addition, 4 patients had seminal vesicle involvement with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels. If these patients also are considered as having complete tumor excision, there was an over-all complete tumor excision rate of 61% (47 of 77), of whom 25 (32% of the 77 patients) had preservation of potency. Ten patients with clinical stage B2 tumor whose potency was preserved had histological and serological evidence of incomplete tumor excision. Of 53 patients with pathological stage C1 disease 9 (17%) had margins positive only in the regions of the neurovascular bundles. Preoperative prostate specific antigen and acid phosphatase levels, and findings on transrectal ultrasonography failed to predict accurately which patients had extracapsular tumor extension. Patients with poorly differentiated tumors and/or bulky disease on rectal examination had a higher incidence of extracapsular extension and positive margins. We conclude that in the majority of potent patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer not all of the goals of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy are realized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There is no consensus on the proper management of men with stage D1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Although cure is unlikely, many men survive for long intervals apparently free of metastatic disease. Thus, effective palliation of the local lesion with low morbidity is desirable. From 1974 to 1987, 120 consecutive men with stage D1 prostate cancer were treated with 3 primary modes of therapy (mean followup 48 months): 1) expectant therapy (35), 2) external beam radiotherapy (21) and 3) radical prostatectomy (64). These patients were statistically homogeneous as determined by Gleason grade but not by extent of metastatic disease. The over-all 5 and 10-year projected actuarial survival rates for the radical prostatectomy patients were 97 and 62%, respectively, and the apparent clinical survival free of disease at 5 years and 80 months, respectively, was 83 and 68%. The direct disease-specific 10-year survival free of disease was 46%. However, only 3 of 27 patients followed for 3 years or longer had undetectable levels of prostate specific antigen. Using a Cox univariate proportional hazards model several factors appeared to have significant prognostic value including volume of lymph node metastases (macroscopic greater than 2 mm.), percentage of positive lymph nodes sampled and frozen section diagnosis. Gleason grade, clinical stage and the number of positive nodes did not have significant prognostic value. Local recurrence requiring an operation was noted in 8 of 35 patients (23%) treated expectantly, 5 of 21 (24%) treated with radiotherapy and 2 of 64 (3%) treated with radical prostatectomy. Significant gastrointestinal or genitourinary complications occurred in 33% of the men treated with radiotherapy and 1.5% of those undergoing radical prostatectomy. Since the introduction of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in 1982, potency resumed in 55% of the 33 patients who were potent preoperatively and have been followed 1 year or longer. These data suggest that in properly selected patients radical prostatectomy, although not curative, can provide excellent palliation of the local lesion with acceptable morbidity and that symptomatic local recurrence of prostatic cancer achieved with radiation therapy is identical to the results in men who were managed expectantly.\r"

With improved surgical technique the incidence of nephrectomy has decreased and renovascular reconstruction is currently the preferred method to manage this entity. Between 1977 and 1988, 21 patients with renovascular hypertension were treated at our hospital: 7 patients 6 to 16 years old underwent renal autotransplantation. Of the children 4 had unilateral and 3 had bilateral disease requiring bilateral autotransplantation. Autotransplantation was performed by anastomosis of each renal artery end-to-side to the common iliac artery. The renal veins were anastomosed end-to-side to the common iliac veins. The ureters were left intact in all but 1 patient who required a bench operation. Of the 4 patients who had a unilateral procedure 3 are cured and 1 is improved with a normal blood pressure on a small dose of antihypertensive medication. The 3 patients with bilateral autotransplants are cured. These results, with normalization of the blood pressure in 86% of the patients and improvement in blood pressure in 14% with a patency rate of 87%, are similar to other reported reconstructive modalities in children.\r"

  ".U": "91039616\r", 
  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested that the prophylactic use of clean intermittent catheterization in selected infants with myelodysplasia and with normal upper tracts may prevent their deterioration. The selection of these patients at risk depends on urodynamic criteria. We reviewed our experience with clean intermittent catheterization instituted when upper tract deterioration was found. Of 130 patients with myelodysplasia followed at our clinic 25 (19%) had or presented with radiological upper urinary tract deterioration. A total of 21 patients had vesicoureteral reflux and 4 had hydronephrosis without reflux. Treatment consisted of clean intermittent catheterization alone in 5 patients and combined with anticholinergic medication in 16. Four patients with no post-void residual urine were carefully observed without intervention. Urodynamic evaluation was performed selectively in 11 of these 25 patients for persistence of upper urinary tract deterioration or urinary incontinence after institution of treatment. Of the 21 children with reflux 19 (90%) had resolution or improvement for an average followup of 47 months. Hydronephrosis completely resolved in the 4 patients without reflux. Thus, the over-all resolution or improvement rate was 92% for an average of 41 months. Although these excellent results may not be superior to the prophylactic use of clean intermittent catheterization, they validate the assumption that upper tract deterioration can be reversed. The application of current urodynamic selection criteria may result in overtreating a significant number of infants who otherwise may not have upper tract deterioration. Further refinements in these criteria may be necessary to select better not only patients at risk but also to determine the frequency of imaging necessary in this urologically heterogeneous population. In addition, careful consideration should be given to urethral dilation as a third and equally viable alternative to prevent upper tract deterioration.\r"

This office-based imaging procedure provides an accurate assessment of the prostate, ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles, which can be helpful in the evaluation of certain infertile patients. We describe 3 patients who presented with either azoospermia or decreased ejaculate volume in whom transrectal ultrasonography had a critical role in the fertility evaluation. The clinical indications for and interpretation of transrectal ultrasonography in the infertile population are described. Transrectal ultrasonography currently is the most accurate, inexpensive and readily available noninvasive imaging technique used to diagnose obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts in the infertile patient with either azoospermia or low ejaculate volume.\r"

The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the DNA synthesis phase was determined by an in vitro labeling technique. The percentage of labeled cells was expressed as the labeling index (LI). The average LI values in normal subjects and cancer-bearing subjects were 5.1(%) and 24.2(%) respectively. With the transition of the bladder epithelium from simple hyperplasia to cancer, the LI values of the bladder epithelium were increased. Cases of papillary or nodular (PN) hyperplasia were divided into two types according to the localization of the BrdUrd-labeled cells. The LI in PN hyperplasia was 12.4(%); the difference from cancer was significant. In another experiment, the effect of partial cystectomy on bladder tumors was examined. The group with partial cystectomy showed increases in grade and stage of cancer, and the LI of cancer was more than that in the group without partial cystectomy. The results indicate that partial cystectomy may play a role as promotor for bladder tumors. The current study may be of more practical value than is the conventional one for investigating the histogenesis and progression of human bladder cancer.\r"

CC tissues were obtained from 12 impotent men undergoing surgery for insertion of penile prostheses. CC preparations were mounted in a tissue bath and the isometric tension was recorded. Papaverine and thiphenamil consistently inhibited high-potassium ([K])-induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. Noradrenaline (NA)-induced contractions were inhibited by both agents in a non-competitive manner. The pD'2 values were 4.77 +/- 0.20 for papaverine and 4.58 +/- 0.13 for thiphenamil. Papaverine at 10(-4) M, the concentration at which high-[K]-induced contraction was abolished, suppressed NA-induced contraction by approximately 85%. In the Ca2(+)-free solution containing two mM EGTA, NA-induced contraction was suppressed by approximately 90%. This contraction was inhibited by papaverine or thiphenamil in a dose-dependent manner and was abolished by papaverine at 10(-4). These results suggest that papaverine and thiphenamil relax CC tissue by the inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ influx (mainly voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx) and by the inhibition of release and/or storage of intracellular stored Ca2+.\r"

We induced hemorrhagic cystitis in rats using cyclophosphamide and compared controls to those pretreated with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Rats were then evaluated for differences in bladder weights, gross edema, gross bleeding, and histologic changes. The weights of the bladders which had been treated with cyclophosphamide were 94% greater than the controls. The weights of the bladders which were pretreated with prostaglandin F2 alpha before cyclophosphamide were only 19% greater than controls. Significant differences were found between cyclophosphamide controls and prostaglandin F2 alpha pretreated groups for gross weight (p less than .0005), gross edema (p less than .0005), and histology (.0005 less than p less than .005). We conclude that prostaglandin F2 alpha may be helpful in preventing cyclophosphamide induced cystitis.\r"

Histological evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was used as an indicator of tissue trauma. Depilated C3H mice were anesthetized and placed on a special frame to enhance visualization and treatment of the kidneys in situ. A Wolf electrohydraulic generator and 9 French probe designed for endoscopic use were utilized to expose the kidneys to 10 double spherically divergent shock waves. Measurements of the shock waves revealed two positive pressure peaks of similar magnitude for each spark discharge. The kidneys were exposed to different peak pressures by choice of distance from the spark source and were removed immediately after treatment for histologic processing. A dose response was noted with severe corticomedullary damage apparent following 15 to 20 MPa shocks. Hemorrhage was more apparent in the medulla where evidence of damage could be seen following pressures as low as three to five MPa. When a latex membrane was interposed to prevent possible collapse of the initial bubble from the spark source against the skin surface, histological evaluation revealed substantial reduction of severe tissue damage associated with the highest pressures tested, 20 MPa. However, the threshold level for evidence of hemorrhage remained about three to five MPa. Hydrophonic measurements indicated that the membrane allowed transmission of the acoustic shock waves and suggested that collapse of the bubble generated by electrohydraulic probes may have local effects due to a cavitation-like mechanism.\r"

We report here the rapid and continuous purification of PSA using a simple two column chromatography technique originally developed for purification of p30. Using commercial antisera to PSA and original antisera to p30 for detection, we show that the two glycoproteins have identical purification profiles by this technique which uses cation exchange chromatography and sizing chromatography. The antigens also have identical molecular weights by gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. Furthermore, both antigens correspond to the same prominent protein band in seminal plasma by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On commercial immunoassay for PSA, purified p30 gives a calibration curve identical to the commercial PSA kit calibrator (Pros-checkTM PSA Radioimmunoassay, Yang Laboratories). We conclude that PSA and the semen protein p30 are identical and can be easily purified by a rapid continuous technique.\r"

  ".W": "Two leading commercial immunoassays for prostate specific antigen (the Yang Laboratories polyclonal radioimmunoassay and the Hybritech two-site monoclonal radioimmunometric assay) were compared using independently purified antigen as the calibrator. The Yang polyclonal assay yielded values from 1.4 to 1.9 times higher than the Hybritech monoclonal assay on the same sample, similar to results of previous investigators. When an independent prostate specific antigen calibrator was substituted for the respective kit calibrators, both assays yielded essentially identical results, thereby confirming that differences in assay values arise from differences in the assigned values of the kit calibrators. Otherwise, both assays had similar responses in the high and low range. Recovery studies of prostate specific antigen in various diluents demonstrated that antigen recovery was lowest in diluents with the highest protein content. We conclude that the kit manufacturers have assigned different values to their antigen calibrators. Sample values between the assays can be compared by use of an appropriate conversion table. Differences in their recommended ranges of normal for prostate specific antigen in male serum (zero to 2.5 ng./ml. for the Yang assay and zero to 4.0 ng./ml. for the Hybritech assay) reflect two factors: a difference in assigned calibrator values and differences in the selection of the \"normal\" population of men used to define the normal range of values. We urge adoption of an international standard calibrator for prostate specific antigen as a means to correct these differences.\r"

Ten cats subjected to spinal contusion at the ninth thoracic segment were treated with guanabenz (an alpha-2 agonist) intraperitoneally (0.65 mg./kg.) three hours after injury, and twice daily for eight weeks. An additional six spinal cats were untreated and served as controls. Urodynamic studies were performed on a weekly basis on all animals. Guanabenz modified the vesico-somatic reflex: detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was either ablated or abolished. In contrast, the controls demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, high residual urine, and spasticity below the lesion. Histological evaluations of the spinal cords revealed that the six paraplegic animals (untreated) suffered marked cavitation of the cord and complete destruction of the grey matter. The five incomplete paraplegic animals (treated) showed minimal cavitation with some preservation of the grey matter. The five ambulators (treated) demonstrated some distortion of grey matter with preservation of white matter. Treatment with guanabenz post traumatic cord injury results in decreased cord cavitation. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia is diminished and hind limb function is improved in treated animals.\r"

Thiorphan also enhanced and prolonged the capsaicin-induced contraction in strips from the bladder dome which is thought to be mediated by release of endogenous tachykinins. Exposure to capsaicin produced simultaneous release of SP- and tachykinin-like immunoreactivity both in presence and absence of mucosa. This effect of capsaicin was potentiated by thiorphan. Endopeptidase 24.11 activity was detected in the guinea-pig urinary bladder, being more concentrated in the mucosal than the muscular layer. These findings indicate that endopeptidase 24.11 terminates the activity of tachykinins in the guinea-pig urinary bladder and modulates the intensity of the biological response produced after their release from peripheral endings of sensory nerves.\r"

Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium. The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2) for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586 +/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens, the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and 588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression. In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic epithelium.\r"

Comparison of the Doppler color-flow mapping results with similarly recorded flow visualization (hydrogen bubble) images showed a close correspondence of key features of the flow, including detection of a high-velocity, centerline jet and near-wall separated flow zones. Distinctive flow patterns exist with each stenotic case, and these should be of considerable value in diagnosing clinical disease conditions.\r"

No significant differences between saphenous vein at any level and everted (double layer) cervical vein, but all were significantly different from single layer cervical vein (p less than 0.05). From June 1987 through November 1989, 19 patients underwent 21 carotid endarterectomies complemented with adjunctive everted cervical vein patch angioplasty. Indications for surgery were asymptomatic stenosis (53%), transient ischemic attack (29%), and cerebrovascular accident with recovery (18%). All patients were studied after surgery with duplex scanning. Asymptomatic recurrent stenosis was observed in one patient. Transient hypoglossal nerve dysfunction occurred in one other patient. One postoperative death occurred as a result of massive aspiration. These results indicate that everted cervical vein is comparable to the saphenous vein in resistance to bursting and can yield similar results as patch material after carotid endarterectomy. Accordingly, saphenous vein can be spared and lower extremity incisions avoided.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their presentation is often variable and may include pain and obstruction of adjacent anatomic structures. This report describes a 68-year-old man who sought treatment after insidious onset of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema over a 6-month period. Noninvasive studies were suggestive of bilateral iliac vein occlusion, and a venogram showed a nearly obstructed vena cava from external compression. A CT scan showed a thick-walled infrarenal abdominal aneurysm. At exploration an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm was found. Because of the presence of dense inflammatory changes surrounding the aneurysm and extending into the pelvis, the surgical procedure of choice was an aortobifemoral bypass graft done with Dacron. The aneurysmal wall was debrided from the vena cava. His postoperative course was uneventful, his edema resolved, and follow-up noninvasive studies were normal. Postoperative venography showed resolution of the extrinsic compression of the vena cava.\r"

  ".W": "Saphenous vein patch rupture after carotid endarterectomy is an infrequent but devastating complication. This study was undertaken to evaluate the material and structural properties of fresh human saphenous veins to understand the causes of this complication. Segments of saphenous veins were obtained from 22 patients from vein harvested during coronary artery bypass surgery. Ninety-three specimens, oriented in both circumferential (n = 45) and longitudinal (n = 48) directions, were prepared from the available vein segments for testing. Specimens were mounted on specially designed grips and then subjected to uniaxial tension testing. For each specimen the following material and structural parameters were determined: vessel diameter, tensile stiffness, failure and ultimate forces, and tensile modulus, failure stress, and strain. The physical properties of specimens evaluated in longitudinal orientations and thus limit the inherent strength of the vein. The physical properties of circumferentially tested vein specimens were negatively correlated to age, female gender, diabetes, and hypertension. The data obtained in this investigation suggest that age, hypertension, as well as diabetes and gender may adversely influence the circumferential tensile strength of human saphenous veins used as patch grafts.\r"

The use of this model enabled the resident to become more adept with the instruments for valve incision and construction of small vessel anastomosis. The improvement in the resident's operative technique was reflected by a decrease in the number of technical complications (missed valves, missed arteriovenous fistulas, poorly constructed anastomoses) and improved patency rate.\r"

This report describes the evaluation of a family with recurrent deep venous thrombosis and superficial thrombophlebitis. Levels of antithrombin III and protein C as well as plasminogen were normal. The levels of total protein S, which includes the value for the free and complexed forms of protein S, were also normal. However, the free protein S levels were greatly reduced in all symptomatic members who were studied. This report illustrates the importance of obtaining measurement of free protein S levels in patients who are suspected of having inherited venous thrombotic disorders.\r"

The present study used a compound that, by its ability to bind with free iron, can remove hydroxyl radical (OH.) from tissue. Deferoxamine reduced tissue injury during cooling and rewarming, as evidenced by its ability to decrease tissue release of lactic acid dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Deferoxamine also reduced the formation of OH. and lipid peroxidation during the rewarming phase. This compound did not have any effect on the arterial blood flow pattern, which uniformly decreased during cooling and was restored during rewarming. The results of this study indicate the efficacy of deferoxamine in reducing cellular injury associated with cold and rewarming and further suggest a role for oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathophysiology of cold-rewarming injury.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients with severe pedal ischemia in the presence of palpable foot pulses are described. All had atherosclerosis, and seven patients also had diabetes. There were two anatomic patterns of disease, including supramalleolar obstruction with reconstitution of pulsatile flow in three patients and segmental occlusion of the pedal vessels in five. All patients underwent arterial reconstructive surgery. Patency was sustained in six patients, with limb salvage in five and below-knee amputation in one patient for persistent necrosis and infection of an open amputation. Of the two eventual bypass failures, a transmetatarsal amputation continued to heal in one patient, and the other required amputation below the knee. Palpable pedal pulses and satisfactory ankle/brachial indexes did not rule out the presence of surgically correctable distal arterial occlusive disease. Therefore arteriography is indicated in any patient with persistent forefoot ischemia that fails to respond to conservative measures. The safety and patency of the distal reconstructive procedures performed in this series suggest that salvage of weight-bearing tissue and rapid healing, as well as limb salvage, are legitimate indications for revascularization.\r"

The patient had intraabdominal bleeding as a result of a ruptured omental artery. The pathologic and arteriographic findings are described. The pathology is characterized by segmental disruption of the medial smooth muscle cells and the initiation of mediolysis. Mediolysis is associated with marked segmental thinning of the vessel wall, often with only the adventitia intact. Fibrin is deposited at the adventitial and medial surfaces, and hemorrhage into the media may occur. As in this reported case, lysis of the adventitia leads to sudden, often catastrophic intraabdominal hemorrhage. Little associated adventitial inflammation occurred. Segmental mediolytic arteritis seems to involve the intra-abdominal muscular arteries in elderly patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. An angiogram showed patchy areas of narrowing involving ileal, gastroduodenal, and renal arteries that correlated with the pathologic findings observed in the excised omental arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty was performed in 48 arteries (iliac, superficial femoral, and popliteal). Indications for surgery were limb salvage (25%), rest pain (38%), and claudication (38%). Patients were categorized into three groups: lesions less than 5 cm, greater than 5 to 10 cm, or greater than 10 cm in length. Demographic characteristics, risk factors, and outcome measures were compared by use of Fisher's exact test and Student's t test. The time for vascular patency failure was compared by use of a standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the three groups. Initial failure to recanalize was noted in 14% in lesions less than 5 cm, 40% in lesions greater than 5 to 10 cm, and 73% in lesions greater than 10 cm. The overall success rate was 38%, with a mean follow up of 1 year. The less than 5 cm lesion group had a significantly higher rate of overall success (59%, p = 0.005) than the other two groups combined. The greater than 10 cm lesion group did significantly worse (9%) than the other two groups combined (p = 0.028). Patients in the less than 5 cm group had significantly longer patency than the other two groups (p less than 0.01). Iliac lesions had a higher overall success rate (73%) than superficial femoral and popliteal artery lesions (35%) (p = 0.038). In conclusion, the widespread application of laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty cannot be justified without further long-term clinical and laboratory investigation. Conversely, the potential of this technique should not be dismissed out of hand. Proper patient selection, length and nature of the lesion to be treated, and the appropriate forms, doses, and method of delivery of laser energy, remain to be defined.\r"

Intraoperative exploration and arteriography were consistent with agenesis of the popliteal arterial segment, and postmortem examination confirmed these arteriographic and intraoperative observations. Embryologically, failure of the middle portion of the sciatic artery to persist would account for this anomaly. A review of series reporting congenital anomalies of the lower extremity vasculature failed to discover previous mention of this particular abnormality. Agenesis of the popliteal artery should be included among those vascular anomalies that may affect management of lower extremity vascular disease.\r"

A nonhealing dorsal foot ulcer was debrided, and soft tissue reconstruction was accomplished by the free microsurgical transfer of a muscle flap to the distal lower extremity. Arterial inflow to this free flap was provided by a contralateral reversed saphenous vein graft from the proximal arterial tree of the leg. This procedure resulted in a healed wound, stable coverage, and limb salvage. The patient also noted complete relief of rest pain and improvement in his claudication symptoms. A follow-up arteriogram was done 2 months after surgery. Contrast injection directly into the artery of this flap showed new blood vessel growth from the muscle flap into the foot with anastomoses of these \"new vessels\" to the patient's native circulation. This experience suggests that limb salvage may be possible by the free microvascular transplantation of a muscle flap onto the limb in selected patients whose limbs are deemed \"nonreconstructible.\"\r"
