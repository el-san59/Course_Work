  ".W": "In the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the c-abl gene on chromosome 9 is translocated to bcr on chromosome 22. This results in the expression of a chimeric bcr-abl message that encodes the P210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase. The cells of 10% of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients (ALL) carry a cytogenetically similar Ph1 translocation. We report that Ph1-positive ALL cells express unique abl-derived tyrosine kinases of 185 and 180 kilodaltons that are distinct from the bcr-abl-derived P210 protein of CML. The appearance of the 185/180-kilodalton proteins correlates with the expression of a novel 6.5-kilobase messenger RNA. Thus, similar genetic translocations in two different leukemias result in the expression of distinct c-abl-derived products.\r"

The Sm antigen is thought to bind to a conserved snRNA motif that includes the sequence A(U3-6)G. The hypothesis was tested that yeast also contains functional analogues of Sm snRNA's, but that the Sm binding site in the RNA is more strictly conserved than the Sm antigenic determinant. After microinjection of labeled yeast snRNA's into Xenopus eggs or oocytes, two snRNA's from Saccharomyces cerevisiae become strongly immunoprecipitable with human auto-antibodies known as anti-Sm. These each contain the sequence A(U5-6)G, are essential for viability, and are constituents of the spliceosome. At least six other yeast snRNA's do not become immunoprecipitable and lack this sequence; these non-Sm snRNA's are all dispensable.\r"

In higher eukaryotes, a single endopeptidase has yet to fulfill the necessary criteria as the physiologically relevant convertase. The observation of proalbumin circulating in a child with a bleeding disorder caused by an unusual alpha 1-antitrypsin mutation led to speculation that the presence of this alpha 1-antitrypsin mutant was inhibitory to the convertase. This provided an additional means of characterizing the processing enzyme. In this study the yeast KEX2 enzyme, a calcium-dependent thiol protease, was found to have all the properties expected for this processing enzyme. KEX2 correctly recognized and cleaved the prosequence in proalbumin. In addition, KEX2 was specifically inhibited by the mutant alpha 1-antitrypsin but not by other serine protease inhibitors.\r"

These polypeptides include acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor, angiogenin, and transforming growth factors alpha and beta. Other less well characterized angiogenesis factors have also been isolated, some of which are lipids. This article traces the discovery of the angiogenic factors and describes their possible significance in understanding growth regulation of the vascular system. When evaluated according to their putative targets, they appear to fall into two groups: those that act directly on vascular endothelial cells to stimulate locomotion or mitosis, and those that act indirectly by mobilizing host cells (for example, macrophages) to release endothelial growth factors. In addition to their presence in tumors undergoing neovascularization, the same angiogenic peptides are found in many normal tissues where neovascularization is not occurring. This suggests that physiological expression of angiogenic factors is tightly regulated. In addition to the persistent angiogenesis induced by tumors, it now appears that a variety of nonneoplastic diseases, previously thought to be unrelated, can be considered as \"angiogenic diseases\" because they are dominated by the pathologic growth of capillary blood vessels.\r"

This paper presents an overall view of the binge-purge syndrome, with focus on several of its nephrologic aspects.\r"

This lubricant was chosen because it does not damage the tissues defenses of the host and invite infection. Since poloxamer 188 is readily soluble in aqueous solutions, it is rapidly absorbed in the tissue environment resulting in an uncoated suture that displays increased knot security. The coating of polyglactin 910 is also minimally reactive in tissues and does not damage tissue defense. In contrast with the coated polyglycolic acid sutures, the knot security of the coated polyglactin 910 sutures is not altered by exposure to an aqueous environment or implantation. The increased knot security of the coated polyglycolic acid suture after implantation is considered to be a distinct clinical advantage over that of the coated polyglactin 910 sutures.\r"

  ".W": "Metastatic bacterial endophthalmitis remains a challenge to the clinician despite the success of antibiotics in reducing its frequency and severity. Controversy currently surrounds the management of this condition because of uncertainty about the value of and indications for vitreous surgery. We review 72 cases of metastatic endophthalmitis from the past decade, including five not previously published. The spectrum of causative bacteria changed significantly during this period, with displacement of meningococcus by Bacillus cereus as the most frequently reported agent and an increasing incidence of infection by organisms of low pathogenicity in immunologically compromised hosts. We propose a new classification scheme for metastatic endophthalmitis based on the location (anterior or posterior segment) and extent (focal or diffuse) of the primary intraocular infection. Focal and anterior cases appear to have a good prognosis, while posterior diffuse disease nearly always leads to blindness. Our analysis of outcomes suggests that systemic antibiotics are more valuable in metastatic than in postoperative or traumatic endophthalmitis and that intraocular antibiotic injection and vitrectomy make only a limited contribution to successful treatment in metastatic infection. We recommend a clinical approach to metastatic endophthalmitis that minimizes exposure of patients to the risks of invasive procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The hypermetabolism organ failure complex remains the predominant reason for both prolonged stay and death in the surgical intensive care unit. What was perceived as isolated organ failure, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, is now seen as part of the systemic response to injury and repair. Sepsis has become the systemic inflammatory response due to invading microorganisms. What was once perceived as diagnostic of sepsis has been recognized after severe perfusion deficits and in the presence of continuing sources of dead and injured tissue. The transition to organ failure is usually a distinct clinical event and probably represents the onset of clinical hepatic failure. Once present, the organ failure syndrome has a high mortality rate. From a treatment perspective, it is recognized that there is probably no \"magic bullet\"; that regimens will probably be time dependent and \"multiple drug\"; and that the best treatment is prevention. Malnutrition, as opposed to changes in body composition that occur as a result of disease process, has become a recognized cofactor in morbidity and death in patients with persistent hypermetabolism and organ failure. The metabolic processes of hypermetabolism have become increasingly categorized and understood. The result has been the development of metabolic support principles that are distinct from those of nutritional support and are designed to prevent the end-organ changes of malnutrition and the development of substrate-limited metabolism, to support organ structure and function, and to attempt to arrest the metabolic processes. The initial problem was to learn to do no harm, an outcome reasonably achieved. In addition, several beneficial results have been recognized including new techniques to better support total body protein synthesis, hepatic protein synthesis, and energy production. Techniques to better support organ structure and function are being tested. No techniques are currently available to control proteolysis and the redistribution of skeletal muscle nitrogen. A great deal of research is still necessary in this field, which is still in its infancy.\r"

Maximal ischemic damage was seen at 7 days after transplantation after 120 minutes of ischemia, with more than 30% myocardial necrosis or scarring of myocardial tissue. Isografts performed with ischemia times of less than 60 minutes were followed for more than 100 days. All hearts showed a fine, generalized, perimyocytic fibrosis, which was maximal at 28 days after transplantation and did not progress thereafter. These results will serve as important control measures for future studies in this model because ischemic damage must be considered in examining histologic samples from long-surviving cardiac allografts maintained in immunosuppressed recipients.\r"

Sham acupuncture was defined as the insertion of needles in a point within the same spinal segments as the active acupuncture, but outside the Chinese meridian system. The effect was evaluated from anginal attack rate, nitroglycerin consumption and exercise tests. Compared to patients receiving sham acupuncture the patients receiving active acupuncture increased cardiac work capacity significantly, expressed as dPRP (difference in pressure-rate-product between rest and maximum exercise) and maximal PRP during exercise (p less than 0.001). None of the other variables showed any significant difference between the two groups. Concerning exercise tolerance the median difference was 138 Wmin (95% confidence limits - 12.5 to 325 Wmin), concerning anginal attack rate the median difference was 29.5% (95% confidence limits 55% to -11%) and with regard to nitroglycerin consumption the median difference was 5% (95% confidence limits +67% to -44%). No significant effect of sham treatment was observed, no adverse effect was observed. We suggest that acupuncture may improve cardiac work capacity in patients with angina pectoris, refractory to medical treatment.\r"

The fetal heart rate was affected by therapy, causing a decrease in baseline rate (p less than 0.05) and in acceleration amplitude (p less than 0.05). Although the incidence of suspect fetal distress, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery was high, all surviving infants had normal Apgar scores at 5 and 10 min. Perinatal mortality consisted of one stillbirth. Except for respiratory problems, the incidence of neonatal complications was low. All survivors were healthy at follow-up. We found beta 1-blockade to be effective and safe in this group of high-risk pregnancies, and suggest it as an alternative for anti-hypertensive therapy in diabetic pregnancy.\r"

During the double-blind trial, all six initially ketoconazole-treated patients showed a clear clinical and mycological improvement. In contrast there was no change or worsening in the initially placebo-treated group (p = 0.001). Oral candidosis cleared up in all patients, but more rapidly (less than 2 weeks) in those aged less than 25 years than in older patients (4-10 weeks; p = 0.001). Similarly, nail candidosis improved more rapidly in the younger group. All patients had a recurrence of the candidosis during 36-48 months of post-therapy follow-up. The recurrences likewise responded to ketoconazole. In one patient serum transaminase activities were transiently and marginally elevated during 2-6 weeks of therapy.\r"

The T3 values in both groups were slightly reduced immediately after the operation. There was no recurrence of goitre in the 18-month observation period, and none of the findings suggested that routine thyroxine treatment is of value after resection of nontoxic goitre \"in Denmark\".\r"

Single administration of 250 micrograms vitamin K1, 250 g spinach, 250 g broccoli and 37.5 cl wine did not result in TT-values outside the therapeutic range. However, when Konakion, broccoli and spinach were given daily during one week the TT-values tended to rise above the therapeutic limit, requiring dose adjustment.

On the one hand, the desire to ameliorate iatrogenic diseases, such as BPD and ROP, makes one grasp hopefully at any theory or clinical trial that suggests a role for vitamin E in decreasing the handicaps that patients take with them from the intensive care nursery. On the other hand, when the question of toxicity arises, one tends to be negative, remembering the unfortunate experiences with oxygen, chloramphenicol, sulfisoxazole, and now, E-Ferol Aqueous Solution. We like to think that if this review had been written 2 years ago, our conclusions, based on the analysis of the data, would have been the same. But, probably, in the absence of data on the severe toxicity of one vitamin E preparation, we would have been more liberal in our recommendations for the use of vitamin E in neonatology. At this time, however, any use of supplemental vitamin E beyond the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics cannot be recommended. Nor can the monitoring of blood Vitamin E levels be recommended as an assurance of nontoxic tissue concentrations in sick, premature infants. All physicians caring for premature infants are urged to review their nursery policies to make sure that excessive doses of vitamin E are not being administered. It is hoped that additional clinical trials will provide more definite answers to the questions about the efficacy of vitamin E in ROP and IVH.\r"

Physicians have an understanding of seizures and medications that should be shared with teachers. In turn, teachers know what parts of students' learning seem to be affected by their epilepsy; they also work with students every day and this gives them a unique perspective of changes in the patient's status. Epilepsy can profoundly affect the student-patient, the school, and the home. Pediatricians are in the unique position to share medical information with teachers and parents. By sharing this information, physicians encourage collaboration. Increased collaboration, in turn, helps to reduce the myths and fears surrounding epilepsy. It provides teachers with the information they use to plan instructional programs, and it improves physicians' decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment. Physician/teacher collaboration is generally advocated for patients-students in the \"devastated\" and the \"compromised\" groups. Collaboration is not necessary in patients without problems and it is probably preferable not to risk stigmatizing otherwise intact children by attaching the label \"epilepsy\" to them. When collaboration is indicated, teachers will need some way of organizing information about students' seizure, educational, medical, and psychosocial background. The appendix contains a list of questions grouped according to these categories. If teachers can answer these questions they will be well on the way to resolving the problems confronting the student with epilepsy. It is hoped that physicians will be available and willing to assist teachers and that teachers will seek their assistance.\r"

Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening may also prove to be a significant tool for the early detection of Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. Our knowledge of variables affecting MSAFP levels measured during pregnancy is rapidly evolving and further refinements in the application of MSAFP screening will almost certainly occur.

  ".W": "Diet clearly influences neurotransmission. This can be important in grossly undernourished children. It can also be important in children in whom normal homeostatic mechanisms governing food intake are bypassed. Subtle differences in behavior can occur with physiologic variation in food intake. Components of foods can also be used as drugs. Starvation can impair neuronal maturation and can have lasting effects upon behavior and intellectual performance. The extent of starvation's impact upon the brain depends upon whether undernutrition occurred during a critical phase in brain development. Short-term fasting has small, but significant, effects upon intellectual performance. Even when gross malnutrition is not present, subtle changes in diet may modulate brain function. Tryptophan, tyrosine, and choline in the diet are used as precursors for neuronal synthesis of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, and acetylcholine, respectively. It is likely that the brain's sensitivity to certain components of the diet exists to permit monitoring of food intake by the central nervous system. Tryptophan, tyrosine, and choline may be useful in treatment of humans with sleep disorders, pain depression, mania, hypertension, shock, or dyskinesias. Other components of the diet that may affect behavior include food additives, sugar, and caffeine. Food additives may exacerbate hyperactive symptoms in a small proportion of children with attention deficit disorder. Given that there is little potential for harm and that there is a subpopulation that may respond, a trial of a diet that contains no food additives may be a valid diagnostic approach for children with attention deficit disorder who do not respond to stimulant therapy or for children for whom stimulant therapy is not desired. Refined sugar has been blamed for many behavioral abnormalities. Subtle effects of carbohydrate upon behavior have been reported, but the existing data do not support the hypothesis that sucrose or fructose exert special effects upon neurotransmission. Caffeine is easily detected as a stimulant by humans, but it has little effect upon cognitive function. Administration of large doses of vitamins has no beneficial effect in most humans with schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, autism, Down's syndrome, or drug addiction. Large doses of niacinamide may even be harmful, as they may cause hepatic damage.\r"

Helping maladroit adolescents achieve optimal potential is a challenge for physicians, educators, and others involved in their care. The first steps for professionals are recognizing SLD and ADD and understanding the configurations of these problems as they apply to adolescents and adults. Educators can prioritize academic concerns and evaluate and provide intervention strategies. Physicians can review new pharmacologic data and follow-up studies to help formulate clinical judgments, particularly around the area of medication. Along with counselors, physicians will provide better longitudinal care when aware of the social and behavioral outcomes reported for patients similar to theirs. Finally, awareness of resources facilitates multidisciplinary communication and provides access for patients and clients to needed medical, educational, and support resources. There has always been a sense of advocacy among those working with the adolescent whose exaggerated maladroitness stems from a problem with learning or attention. Perhaps this review will provide a data base from which advocacy can expand to specific action. That has been our goal.\r"

  ".W": "To demonstrate the use of these multiple techniques, one might consider algorithms that are available for various disorders. It is worth pointing out that for imaging of specific abnormalities, they must be evaluated in light of the skill and interest of available personnel and on the equipment that is available. For example, in acute upper abdominal trauma in children the following is one diagnostic route: With no substantial suspicion of brain injury and after evaluation by an attending surgeon; With upper abdominal injury limited reasonably clearly to the kidneys, renal vessels, and ureters: Intravenous sonography; With upper abdominal injury limited reasonably clearly to the liver, spleen, or both: Liver/spleen scintigraphy; With substantial suspicion that the injury is not limited to the kidneys or the liver and spleen: Enhanced CT of upper abdomen; With a suspicion of brain injury sufficient to require CT of the head: CT scan, and if there is abdominal injury as well, contrast enhanced CT of the upper abdomen; Again it is to be emphasized that this diagnostic route (as well as the ones in Figures 1 and 2) represents an approach and is used in the context of this chapter to illustrate the role of the various imaging techniques that are available to the diagnosis of one pediatric problem.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic (1-3 months' duration) appendiceal obstruction was induced in 11 rabbits to assess the pathologic consequences and to study the associated radiologic, sonographic, and CT findings. Three pathologic/radiologic groups resulted with approximately equal frequency. In group A, the abscess was characterized by inflammatory cells in the lumen and wall of the appendix without mucin production. Calcification was shown radiographically, and sonography showed an anechoic or complex pattern. Group B, the \"mixed response,\" was characterized by an intact hyperplastic mucosa, mucin secretion, and inflammatory debris in the lumen. Occasional calcification was present radiographically, and sonography showed a complex or hypoechoic pattern. In group C, true mucoceles had an intact hyperplastic mucosa, a mucin-filled lumen, and minimal inflammation. These were anechoic on sonography except for mobile foci of inflammatory debris. Chronic obstruction of the appendix results in a spectrum of pathologic responses with varying degrees of either inflammation and mucosal destruction or mucosal hyperplasia and mucin secretion. An abscess results when infection overwhelms the host's inflammatory responses. If the bacteria are destroyed by these defenses, a mucocele forms. An intermediate situation occurs when there is a mixed response with chronic inflammatory changes and an intact mucosa. This finding supports the existence of chronic appendicitis in humans.\r"

These procedures were performed within 3 months of transplantation. Fifty-four out of 58 patients were on a cyclosporine-steroid regimen. Acute rejection was diagnosed if one or more of the following findings was present on sonogram: transplant swelling, increased conspicuity of the medullary pyramids, medullary pyramid enlargement, decreased renal-sinus fat, and pelvi-infundibular thickening. Correlation of sonography and histopathologic findings showed that sonography cannot be used independently to diagnose rejection or to distinguish between cyclosporine nephrotoxicity and rejection. A creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dl was then randomly selected as a threshold level to possibly improve the sonographic results, anticipating that above this threshold an abnormal sonogram would invariably be recorded in the presence of rejection. This threshold was not found to be discriminatory. Only at a higher threshold level of creatinine (6.9 mg/dl or more) was there 100% correlation between acute rejection and the presence of abnormal sonographic findings. Furthermore, whereas most patients with four or five abnormal sonographic criteria tended to have acute rejection, this group of patients constituted a minority and, even within this group, sonography was not entirely reliable in detecting transplant rejection.\r"

PGI2 (50 ng/kg/min, infused into the left atrium) reduced infarct mass by 59% compared to control, but SC39902 (1.5 micrograms/kg/min) failed to produce a significant reduction in infarct size. Both PGI2 and SC39902 reduced mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and rate-pressure product to the same extent. Regional myocardial blood flow measured with radiolabelled tracer microspheres did not demonstrate an increase in regional blood flow to the ischemic myocardium during the 90 minutes of LCCA occlusion in the PGI2 and control treatment groups. Canine neutrophils were isolated from whole blood and activated with opsonized zymosan. PGI2 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of neutrophil activation as measured by superoxide production in vitro, whereas SC39902 failed to effectively inhibit neutrophil activation. Neutrophil migration into inflammatory skin lesions was effectively attenuated when dogs were pretreated with PGI2 (50 ng/kg/min, intravenously). Therefore, it is suggested that the cytoprotective effect of PGI2 during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion is related to an inhibition of neutrophil migration and the production of cytotoxic activated oxygen species.\r"

Review of the 49 cases recorded to date reveals that the supple elongated clot produces a 2DE picture--a mass of changing configuration and striking mobility--that is highly characteristic. Since emboli that become entrapped are large, when managed by medical measures alone they have an attendant mortality rate of 50%, usually soon after 2DE diagnosis, upon completion of pulmonary embolization. Death occurred in 8 of 16 patients treated with anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents, or antiaggregants and in 6 of 13 who received supportive measures only. Of 20 patients referred for surgery (cardiotomy and, in 17, pulmonary embolectomy), only three died, two of them failures of preceding anticoagulant treatment. These data indicate that thromboemboli entrapped in the right heart chambers are best handled as a surgical emergency.\r"

Two snacks were based on sugary, manufactured products (chocolate-coated candy bar; cola drink with crisps) and two on whole foods (raisins and peanuts; bananas and peanuts). After the processed-food snacks, plasma-glucose levels tended to rise higher and to fall lower than after the whole-food snacks. The area under the plasma insulin curve was 70% greater after the manufactured snacks than after the raisin-peanut snack. The banana-peanut snack evoked an intermediate insulin response. One subject had pathological insulinaemia after both manufactured snacks but normal responses after both whole-food snacks. These findings suggest that foods and drinks containing added fiber-depleted sugars stress and sometimes overwhelm homeostatic mechanisms but also suggest that the insulin response to food is influenced by the physical state of the food.\r"

Rate of starch digestion was studied in vitro in 37 foods (20 Australian Aboriginal bushfoods, 10 Pacific island foods, and 7 western foods), and rate of absorption of 9 foods (8 bushfoods and 1 western food) was studied in human volunteers. In vitro studies showed that 23 of 30 traditional foods were digested more slowly than 7 western foods. Six of 8 bushfoods produced significantly smaller areas under 3-h postprandial plasma glucose curves than potatoes in seven healthy Caucasian volunteers. There was a good correlation between starch digestibility and plasma glucose response. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that carbohydrate in traditional diets is slowly digested and absorbed and may once have been protective against diabetes.\r"

The mechanism underlying this association can be explained by increased estrogenic stimulus to estrogen-target tissues as the result of three factors. First, increased adrenal secretory activity makes more androgen precursors available for conversion to estrogen in peripheral tissues. Second, the efficiency of conversion of androstenedione (A) to estrone (E1), is elevated in obese subjects because adipose tissue is the major tissue site of conversion. Third, plasma levels of SHBG, which binds estradiol (E2), are depressed in obese subjects and greater than normal amounts of serum estradiol are therefore available to target tissues from the circulation. Recent studies have shown that the levels of estrogens and other steroid hormones in breast fluids are much higher than in serum, which may be the result of local synthesis or increased uptake from the circulation. No differences in estrogen levels of breast fluid have been found between normal women and those with breast disease. A possible explanation may be differences in the levels of estrogen antagonists, such as progesterone.\r"

Results were compared with standard dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) biochemical assay. Overall, significant correlation between biochemical values and cytochemical fluorescence results was found. However, the imprint results were more sensitive and more specific than the frozen section results. A statistically significant difference (P less than 0.05) was observed between touch preparation material and frozen section specimens by the fluorescent method.\r"

The authors also used cytochemical stains for endogenous peroxidase and nonspecific esterase activity. In cases of NTDs, macrophages were present in the amniotic fluid, and in the authors' system they showed intense immunoreactivity for both AFP and GFAP and showed very strong activity for peroxidase and nonspecific esterase, whereas the epithelial cells and red blood cells showed no activity. In six cases of anencephaly, sections from the margin of the cranial end of defective spinal cords at the aperture of the open lesion were also studied for AFP and GFAP. In these cases, AFP- and GFAP-positive cells were found, indicating the possible neural (glial) origin of a part of amniotic fluid macrophages. Although the determination of AFP levels in maternal blood and amniotic fluid is widely used in the prenatal diagnosis of NTDs, demonstration of AFP in amniotic fluid cells by means of immunocytochemistry has not been described.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Dimertest assay as a clinical laboratory test for the measurement of plasma fibrin D-dimer derivatives. The Dimer-test assay specifically detected 2 micrograms/mL of purified fibrin D-dimer or fibrin D-dimer/fragment E complex added to afibrinogenemic plasma but did not detect 500 micrograms/mL of either fibrinogen fragments X, D, E, or 160 micrograms/mL cross-linked fibrinogen. The fibrin(ogen) degradation product (FDP) assays of American Dade or Wellcome Diagnostics detected 5.0 micrograms/mL of fibrin D-dimer and from 1 to 10 micrograms/mL of the other FDPs. Twenty-eight percent of 150 random plasma samples assayed from hospitalized patients were positive for fibrin D-dimer derivatives. Plasma samples from 152 patients suspected of having disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were assayed for serum FDP (Wellcome Diagnostics) and plasma fibrin D-dimer derivatives. Samples from 69% of patients with serum FDP levels less than 10 micrograms/mL, and more than 90% of those with serum FDP levels greater than 10 micrograms/mL, were positive for fibrin D-dimer derivatives. Dimertest results were not modified by heparin, streptokinase, freeze-thawing, or clotting plasma. Serum fibrinogen-related antigens were immunoadsorbed from Dimer-test positive sera by anti-fibrinogen antibody and formalin-fixed Cowan I strain Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein blotting with the use of monoclonal antibody DD-3B6 demonstrated a protein band with similar mobility to purified D-dimer. The measurement of plasma fibrin D-dimer derivatives by the Dimertest assay is a rapid, sensitive, and specific laboratory test for fibrinolysis. The Dimertest assay has proven to be a useful addition to the clinical laboratory and should be helpful in the diagnosis and management of patients with diseases associated with fibrinolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Malnutrition adversely effects hepatic function and structure. In certain instances, histological changes indistinguishable from alcoholic liver disease may be seen. Alcohol is clearly a direct hepatic toxin and its results are not prevented by normal nutritional intake. The majority of patients admitted to the hospital with alcoholic liver disease are moderately to severely malnourished but find it difficult or impossible to resume an intake sufficient to repair and maintain a normal nutritional state. Malnutrition may be considered a complication of alcohol abuse which occurs simultaneously with liver damage. Repair of both nutrition and hepatic histology requires considerable time, more for the latter. Here we review the data which both incriminates and separates the effects of malnutrition and of alcohol on the liver, and review the current literature on the effect of intravenous or enteral protein-calorie supplementation on acute alcoholic liver disease. While the data suggest that improvement in conventional liver tests are accelerated somewhat by such treatment, there have been no major confirmed differences noted between treatment and control groups at 3 to 4 wk. More precise measures of liver function, as opposed to conventional tests of liver status, and longer follow-up periods will be required to substantiate the suggested beneficial effects of iv or enteral protein-calorie supplementation in acute alcoholic hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between the control of blood glucose levels and the progression of early diabetic retinopathy and the width of skeletal muscle capillary basement membrane was studied in 54 insulin-dependent diabetic patients. After initial ophthalmologic evaluation including seven-field fundus photography and fluorescein angiography and measurement of levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and width of skeletal muscle capillary basement membrane, the patients were divided into two groups: an experimental group of 30 patients who were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and a control group of 24 patients who continued to receive conventional treatment--usually two injections of insulin daily. After a mean follow-up period of 31.4 months, the experimental group had a significant decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin levels as compared with baseline values (mean +/- SEM, 7.2 +/- 0.3 percent versus 10.1 +/- 0.4 percent), reflecting improved control of blood glucose levels. The conventional treatment group had no change in glycosylated hemoglobin levels after a mean of 33.5 months of follow-up. With use of either a modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grading system or macular microaneurysm counts, the experimental treatment group showed significantly less progression of retinopathy (p less than 0.05). The skeletal muscle capillary basement membrane width was significantly reduced only in the experimental treatment group with stable or improved retinopathy and was unchanged in the control group. There was a tendency for skeletal muscle capillary basement membrane width to increase in thickness over time in those patients whose retinopathy worsened irrespective of treatment. It is concluded that meticulous diabetic control may slow the progression of early diabetic retinopathy. Changes in skeletal muscle capillary basement membrane width may reflect the course of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".U": "87097272\r", 
  ".W": "The busy internist will encounter numerous renal masses when ordering nonurologic imaging. Concise and quick delineation of cystic from solid masses is necessary. Cystic masses constitute the majority of these masses and once their nature is diagnosed, they require no further work-up or referral. Often, a single imaging technique is unable to confidently establish the cystic nature of a renal mass. Proper selection of an additional imaging modality will often be successful in establishing the cystic characteristics of a benign mass. Referral to a urologist is not necessary in this setting, since the internist can coordinate the imaging evaluation with proper radiologic consultation. Alternatively, when a mass is determined to be solid, urologic consultation and surgical evaluation are necessary. Minimization of the imaging sequence and hospitalization are critical in the diagnostic-related group era. Aimless wandering in the quagmire of imaging techniques is very expensive and nonproductive. Proper selection of one or two imaging tools and occasionally needle puncture should produce clarification of the cystic or solid nature of renal mass. On the basis of our experience, we have designed an imaging algorithm that provides a simple and concise approach to the diagnosis of a renal mass. It differs in design from that previously suggested by us and others because of decreased emphasis on nuclear medicine and greater emphasis on computed tomography. The more pivotal position assumed by computed tomography is based on improved scanner design and several large series attesting to the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this imaging technique. It behooves internists to appreciate the role of various imaging tools in evaluating a renal mass. With radiologic consultation, internists should strive to confidently establish the cystic nature of a renal mass and to refer to a urologist solid masses or those whose nature remains persistently equivocal.\r"

  ".U": "87097274\r", 
  ".W": "Prorenin, the biosynthetic precursor of renin, is synthesized by the kidneys. Herein is reviewed recent evidence that the ovaries also secrete prorenin. It was found that prorenin is present in mature human ovarian follicular fluid in extremely high concentrations and that plasma prorenin levels increase transiently in blood during the menstrual cycle at the time of ovulation. No change in plasma active renin levels occurs at this time. Plasma prorenin level also increases 10-fold in pregnant women very soon after conception. The ovaries are apparently the source of this rise, since plasma prorenin levels did not increase in a pregnant woman with ovarian failure who received a donor egg. All of these changes in plasma prorenin levels appear to be caused by gonadotropic hormones. These results suggest a role for ovarian prorenin in human reproductive function. They may have relevance to studies of female infertility, birth control, and toxemia of pregnancy. They also suggest that a renin system exists that is regulated by changes in prorenin.\r"

Yet, it is far from clear whether there is at the present time an adequate framework for informing patients. Medicolegally, court cases as early as the 1900s strongly emphasized the preservation of individual rights to information in the patient-physician relationship. Most recently, an increasing number of states use the criterion of what a \"reasonable man\" would want as the basis for medical informed consent. Medical ethicists also have offered general principles for consideration by physicians: the importance of patient autonomy and preferences in decisions related to their own health care. This report examines the historical development of informed consent in the United States, legal and ethical perspectives in medical informed consent, and the pragmatic issues yet to be considered by physicians in keeping their duty to inform patients prior to a medical procedure.\r"

Moreover, their use is compatible with several common diseases of old age, such as diabetes, obstructive lung disease, and peripheral vascular disease. We recently conducted a study in 21 patients (average age, 79 +/- 2 years) who completed an eight-week trial with 20-mg nifedipine tablets taken twice daily. Mean blood pressure decreased from 191 +/- 2/96 +/- 2 mm Hg to 151 +/- 4/80 +/- 3 mm Hg. In 15 patients (71 percent), blood pressure decreased to less than or equal to 160/90 mm Hg; in four additional patients (19 percent), diastolic blood pressure decreased by 15 to 25 percent. Thus, there was a sustained lowering of blood pressure in 90 percent of the participants receiving nifedipine monotherapy. A review of recent studies in elderly hypertensive patients revealed similarly favorable results with calcium channel blockers given alone or in combination with other agents. The accumulating data suggest that these compounds may offer a useful new approach to the treatment of hypertension in old age. However, in these studies, the number of patients and the duration of follow-up need to be extended to confirm the favorable impression obtained thus far.\r"

  ".W": "Although abnormalities of calcium metabolism have been described in various hypertensive states, the specific manner in which these abnormalities contribute to the increased pressure remains unclear. Our own group, in attempting to resolve the seemingly contradictory evidence thus far obtained, has adopted an approach emphasizing the clinical as well as biochemical heterogeneity among hypertensive subjects. We have observed the following: broad-based deviations of calcium ionic and hormonal indices in patients with essential hypertension; these deviations are linked with concurrent deviations in the renin-aldosterone system. Thus, low-renin subjects exhibit a calcium ionic and hormonal profile suggestive of calcium deficiency, whereas high-renin subjects have an opposite metabolic profile suggestive of calcium excess; blood pressure responses to dietary salt loading may also differ among renin subgroups of essential hypertension and may be mediated by salt-induced alterations of calcium metabolism. In the absence of these alterations, dietary salt intake results in little or no change in blood pressure; and calcium as a dietary supplement may itself possess antihypertensive properties in targeted subgroups of essential hypertensive patients, preferentially in low-renin, lower ionized calcium subjects. Interestingly, calcium channel blockade also preferentially lowers pressure in low-renin, lower serum ionized calcium forms of hypertension and may define those subjects whose elevated pressure is most dependent on extracellular calcium. Conversely, renin profiling or serum ionized calcium measurements may be used clinically to help target subjects most likely to benefit from calcium channel antagonists. Lastly, unlike other antihypertensive drug classes, high salt intake does not blunt, and may even enhance, the hypotensive effects of calcium channel blockade, lessening the need for stringent dietary recommendations. Altogether, these heterogeneous alterations of calcium metabolism in essential hypertension suggest that the linkage between the regulation of calcium metabolism, renin system activity, and blood pressure in essential hypertension is of pathophysiologic as well as therapeutic relevance.\r"

On the other hand, an acute carcinoid crisis with severe diarrhea, dehydration, and hypotension may develop in the patient. Patients with flushing and/or diarrhea, not responsive to standard symptomatic measures, may benefit from chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Chemotherapy with single agents or combination chemotherapy may be associated with response rates ranging from 20 to 40 percent. Hepatic de-arterialization by ligation or occlusion is an effective means of inducing rapid tumor shrinkage for patients who have carcinoid tumors and hepatic dominant metastases. The addition of chemotherapy after induction of a partial remission with hepatic de-arterialization may prolong the duration of response, but this remains to be proven in prospective clinical trials. Hormonal therapy with the antiestrogen tamoxifen has been unsuccessful, but treatment of the carcinoid syndrome with a long-acting analogue of somatostatin has been strikingly effective.\r"

Equipotent effects were observed on the inhibition of basal gastrin release from the stomach. SMS 201-995 was approximately 14 times less effective than somatostatin-14 (molar basis) in the pancreas. At a high glucose concentration (17.6 mM), neither the analogue nor the peptide inhibited insulin release, but at a glucose concentration of 8.8 mM, there was significant inhibition. In the presence of 10 mM arginine plus glucose at a concentration of either 8.8 or 17.6 mM, insulin secretion was reduced by both SMS 201-995 and somatostatin-14 to levels obtained with glucose alone. However, when gastric inhibitory polypeptide (10 ng/ml) in the presence of 8.8 mM glucose was used to stimulate insulin release, somatostatin-14 completely inhibited the insulinotropic action of gastric inhibitory polypeptide while SMS 201-995 was without effect. Studies with this analogue suggest that arginine and gastric inhibitory polypeptide stimulate insulin release via different mechanisms.\r"

Three of these peptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, and somatostatin, regulate the function of immune effector cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Vasoactive intestinal peptide modulates lymphocyte migration and natural killer cell activity by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent mechanism, whereas substance P induces mediator release by a cAMP-independent mechanism. Somatostatin antagonizes the effects of both vasoactive intestinal peptide and substance P by a mechanism that appears to involve inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Neuropeptide regulation of immune cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue may thus play an important role in gastrointestinal physiology.\r"

When 50 micrograms of analogue was administered subcutaneously at 8 A.M. and 5:30 P.M., growth hormone secretion over 24 hours was not significantly affected, and the nocturnal growth hormone surge persisted in normal subjects and in type II diabetic patients. Insulin secretion was suppressed in both groups, but glucose tolerance deteriorated only in the normal subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects developed in both groups. Subcutaneous administration of 50 micrograms of SMS 201-995 at 11 P.M. decreased nocturnal growth hormone secretion (peak, 5 +/- 2 milliunits/liter versus 23 +/- 6 milliunits/liter; p less than 0.01) in normal subjects. Postprandial circulating glucose and insulin levels the following day were unaffected by SMS 201-995, and no side effects were observed. In type I diabetic patients receiving a variable rate insulin infusion overnight to maintain normoglycemia, SMS 201-995 (50 micrograms) administered at 11 P.M. decreased insulin requirements for two to three hours after injection. Insulin sensitivity thereafter was unaffected despite suppression of growth hormone secretion. Alternative dosage regimens are necessary to suppress growth hormone release over 24 hours and to minimize side effects in type II diabetes. Administration of the analogue in the late evening suppresses growth hormone secretion overnight, but the \"dawn phenomenon\" persists in type I diabetic patients.\r"

In the past, we have devoted too many resources to testing for rare diseases suspected of causing hypertension when it has been demonstrated that secondary causes are rare. Devoting resources to the effective treatment of essential hypertension itself should be a priority, because such treatment has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. Clinical and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that treatment for hypertension should not be initiated unless diastolic blood pressure readings are 90 mm Hg or greater on three successive office visits. Treatment should be carried out in a step-wise fashion, using a non-pharmacologic approach only in situations in which hypertension is mild, target organ disease is absent, and compliance is favorable. Diuretics should be used as step-one drug therapy in most situations, because they are effective in the majority of patients, convenient to use, easy to titrate, and comparatively inexpensive. They do not cause salt and water retention, and side effects are usually minimal. When the use of diuretics is contraindicated, beta blockers are suitable alternatives, equally effective in most respects. When beta blockers or other non-diuretic drugs are used as step-one therapy and an additional drug is needed, diuretics can be used advantageously in conjunction with the step-one drug.\r"

  ".U": "87097345\r", 
  ".W": "A \"stepped-care\" approach has been widely recommended for more than 10 years as an empiric method for the treatment of hypertension. This approach encourages the use of diuretics or beta blockers as initial monotherapy for hypertension. Although these and other antihypertensive regimens tested in clinical trials have substantially reduced morbidity and mortality from cerebrovascular disease, their relative effectiveness in reducing the sequelae of coronary artery disease is not as well established. These findings, coupled with the development of new drug regimens, have led to a re-examination of the stepped-care guidelines. This re-examination will stimulate increased interest in the therapeutic choices made by practicing physicians, particularly because the newer drugs are more costly than the traditional treatments. To address this question, we performed two specific studies, using data bases from Michigan and Tennessee Medicaid programs. The first study analyzed prescriptions for newly diagnosed cases of essential hypertension. The second study analyzed secular trends in the prescribing of antihypertensive regimens since that time. The data suggest that in 1982 and 1983 (the time period under consideration in the first part of the study), physicians treating hypertension for Medicaid enrollees followed the stepped-care recommendations, the majority using diuretics as step-one monotherapy. The secular trend data in the second study showed a moderate decrease in the use of diuretics since 1983. There were marked increases in the use of newer antihypertensive medications such as calcium channel blockers and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Because the costs of the newer drugs are substantially higher, a shift to these drugs would significantly increase the cost of treating hypertension in this country. Prospective, controlled trials are necessary to ascertain if the increased costs of the newly developed drugs are justified by potential benefits.\r"

In April 1984, treatment with alpha-2 interferon was begun, and two weeks later, evidence of acute corneal allograft rejection developed. The allograft rejection responded to temporary discontinuation of alpha-interferon and the administration of topical corticosteroid. Treatment with interferon was resumed, and he has subsequently had no clinical evidence of rejection.

It has previously been shown that TME and ACE have similar validity as markers of disease activity, and that when used concurrently, they complement each other in the detection of active disease. In the present study, serum TME and ACE were measured in 122 consecutive patients with sarcoidosis, and the relationship of these enzymes to radiographic stage, disease chronicity, and corticosteroid treatment was examined. Highest values of TME and ACE were seen in patients with hilar adenopathy and parenchymal disease (roentgenographic stage II) (p less than 0.05). The mean TME value for patients with chronic disease (at least two years' duration, with parenchymal infiltrates and/or persistent lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, uveitis, or bone lesions) was twice that of all other patients (p less than 0.001). In contrast, ACE was not significantly increased in chronic disease. Follow-up measurements of these enzymes in patients subsequently treated with corticosteroids revealed that TME values did not significantly change with treatment, whereas ACE decreased by 50 percent (p = 0.005). In summary, TME and ACE are markers of active sarcoidosis that are most elevated in patients with radiographic stage II disease. TME differs from ACE in that TME is elevated in patients with chronic sarcoidosis and it is not affected by administration of corticosteroids. The data indicate that TME and ACE may reflect different aspects of the disease process.\r"

There is also increasing evidence that certain bacteria and parasites participate as cofactors in the development of some cancers. Although proof of cause-and-effect relationships has been difficult to obtain, there can be little doubt that microorganisms occasionally play pivotal roles in the origin of some cancers. Whether attempted intervention against these cancers is best directed against the oncogenic microorganisms themselves or against other environmental cofactors is not yet clear. Nevertheless, the successful application of tumor vaccines in the prevention of Marek's disease in chickens and in modifying the outcome of oncogenic herpesvirus infections in nonhuman primates offers hope of at least limited application of microbial vaccines in the prevention of human cancer.\r"

A killed influenza vaccine, given in enteric-coated capsules (total of 98 ug hemagglutinin of A/Bangkok) led to significant salivary and nasal IgA antibody rises in a 4-week period. The preimmunization titers in secretions were inversely correlated with the antibody rise after immunization. The orally administered vaccine was associated with no more side effects than placebo, in contradistinction to reactions following the intramuscular route. The latter route also was without significant effect in regard to a stimulation of secretory antibodies. The observed simultaneous induction of antibodies in saliva and nasal secretions following oral administration of killed vaccine gives further evidence of a common mucosal immune system and its possible clinical use.\r"

The process of metastasis is an orderly, stepwise process that results in the selection of cells that possess the capability to establish viable metastases. These cells must be locally invasive and be able to survive the physical traumas of dissemination and normal host defenses. Once metastatic cells have been arrested in a capillary bed, they must be able to invade the host organ parenchyma and survive in that milieu. Studies in a number of model systems have documented the phenotypic alterations in cells that have \"metastatic potential.\" These differences may stem from normal tumor cell heterogeneity and surprisingly reflect only minor differences in gene expression. The role of activated oncogenes in metastasis is unclear, but a number of laboratories have documented that transfection with activated Ha-Ras results in increased metastatic potential. An increased understanding of the genetic basis of metastatic potential may suggest new directions for intervening in this deadly process.\r"

The incidence of death or myocardial infarction rises in the first few months after destabilization of angina. Hemodynamic, scintigraphic, and arteriographic studies in the last 15 years have shown that unstable angina is chiefly due to \"dynamic\" coronary stenoses, transient reversible limitations in coronary blood flow caused by a complex interaction between coronary vasoconstriction, transient platelet plugging, and transient thrombosis. The trigger for the onset of dynamic coronary stenoses is probably acute changes in coronary arterial morphology in or near atherosclerotic plaques making those areas more thrombogenic. A large fraction of patients with unstable angina restabilize initially with medical management. The role of beta blockers is unclear, but they may protect against development of coronary events for patients with unstable angina similar to that reported for patients with myocardial infarction. Nitrates and calcium blockers are probably superior to beta blockers in restabilization of angina, but protection against coronary events has not yet been demonstrated clearly. Further investigation is needed to distinguish the relative benefits of a two-drug (heart rate-limiting calcium blocker plus nitrates) regimen vs. a three-drug regimen including beta blocker. There is no basis for emergency coronary bypass surgery to prevent myocardial infarction or death. Urgent surgery should be limited to patients who do not stabilize readily with medical therapy. One third or more of the patients who initially restabilize with medical therapy will require coronary revascularization in the year after unstable angina because of severe angina. An antithrombotic regimen of aspirin (or possibly heparin) reduces the incidence of progression to death or myocardial infarction. Two important future directions for research should be promising: development of better antithrombotic regimens other than aspirin alone for protection against coronary events; and improved ability to distinguish the patients who initially respond to medical therapy who are at low risk for later severe angina from those at higher risk.\r"

Although the profound metabolic effects of beta-adrenergic agents have been well described, the possibility that adjunctive magnesium might cause further or unexpected alterations in maternal metabolic parameters has not been fully evaluated. To investigate this question, we prospectively randomized patients, in a blinded fashion, to receive ritodrine plus placebo or ritodrine plus adjunctive magnesium sulfate for preterm labor tocolysis. Serial measurements of potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and hematocrit were obtained and compared between tocolytic treatment groups. The metabolic changes found were similar in each group and appear to result predominantly from beta-adrenergic stimulation with no apparent perturbations caused by the direct cellular actions of magnesium sulfate. From the metabolic standpoint, it appears that the clinician may use adjunctive magnesium sulfate without fear of accentuating or obscuring the expected beta-adrenergic-induced alterations in the above-mentioned maternal metabolic parameters.\r"

These differences were not statistically significant. Complement was equally likely to be found in proliferative, secretory, menstrual, or inflammatory endometrium. Endometrial complement was found less frequently in patients with severe endometriosis as compared with those with the mild form. Among patients with endometriosis and infertility, complement was much more likely to be found in patients with primary infertility than in those with secondary infertility (p less than 0.007). In short-term follow-up of these patients, the absence of complement in the eutopic endometrium appeared to be a good predictor of subsequent pregnancies.\r"

In the cervix at term pregnancy, a marked decrease in fibrous connective tissue with increased proportions of smooth muscle fibers was characteristic, forming expanded spaces in between due to edema (clear spaces) with focal infiltrations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Type I and type III collagens were distributed only around smooth muscle fiber bundles with some fibroblasts attached. Type IV collagen was distributed in a linear fashion delineating individual smooth muscle fibers and vascular basement membranes. A possible role of infiltrated polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the dissociation of fibrous connective tissues of the cervix at term pregnancy is discussed.\r"

To better understand this potentially valuable observation, we explored aspects of the finding not considered in previous reports. The published data were reanalyzed to estimate statistically the presence of the sign in a low-risk obstetric population. Second, films of chromosomally normal fetuses were reviewed to confirm the normal range of measurement. Finally, autopsy reports of aborted Down syndrome fetuses were reviewed. Our results confirm that true nuchal thickening is present in some second-trimester Down syndrome fetuses. Unfortunately, a positive sign occurs in a significant proportion of chromosomally normal fetuses. Also our calculations predict a high incidence of false positive results in a low-risk obstetric population. Consequently we urge caution in the interpretation of these findings until prospective characterization of these observations is available.\r"

In 412 of these patients labor started spontaneously, and the estimated dates of delivery determined by these three methods were also compared. In the range of 9 to 17 weeks of pregnancy, gestational age can be determined by human placental lactogen measurement to within 7 days (+/- 1 SD) which compares favorably with other methods. Regarding the prediction of the expected date of delivery, 88% were delivered within 2 weeks of the date predicted by last menstrual period, 82% within 2 weeks of the sonar date, and 80% by the date determined by human placental lactogen assessment. Prediction of delivery in a further group of 139 women with uncertain dates gave 73% within 2 weeks by sonar date and 69% within 2 weeks by human placental lactogen determination. We suggest human placental lactogen measurements should become part of routine antenatal care complementing rather than replacing the role of ultrasonic scanning. For those doctors and patients who wish to avoid more exposure to ultrasonic scanning than absolutely necessary, human placental lactogen estimates offer an alternative method for assessing the length of gestation.\r"

C. trachomatis culture confirmed 86.3% of deoxyribonucleic acid-positive results and 84.0% of antigen-positive results. The overall sensitivities of chlamydial deoxyribonucleic acid and antigen assays were 91.7% and 68.8%, respectively, whereas the specificities were 95.3% and 94.7%. Results also suggested that the test of the C. trachomatis deoxyribonucleic acid correlated better with the female urogenital chlamydial infections than did the antigen test of C. trachomatis. The combined results of higher sensitivity in detecting the microorganism and better correlation with disease activity may make the deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization test a useful tool for the early and accurate diagnosis of C. trachomatis infections in female patients.\r"

After differences between the two groups in race, marital status, participation in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), quantity of prenatal care, and other risk factors were statistically controlled, the chance of a Medicaid woman having a low-weight birth was still more than twice as great (p = 0.007). A case-management approach and greater use of services ancillary to basic obstetric medical care appear to contribute to the better birth weight outcomes in the health department.\r"

It was also observed that the papillary endoderm, which contained blood cells in the center and protruded into the endodermal tubules, resembled the Schiller-Duval body of yolk sac tumor. Ultrastructurally the tumor cells were similar to the yolk sac endoderm. alpha-Fetoprotein was positive in the yolk sac endoderm until approximately the seventh week of pregnancy. Yolk sac tumor was also alpha-fetoprotein-positive. In other words, our study of human yolk sacs of 4- to 11-week pregnancies presumes that the yolk sac tumor resembles the endoderm of 4- to 7-week pregnancies.\r"

The trials demonstrated no other statistically significant benefit associated with the use of electronic fetal monitoring, but most reported significant increases in the rates of abdominal and vaginal operative deliveries associated with electronic fetal monitoring.

In mid and late secretory phase, the level of expression diminishes slowly. The epitope is absent from glandular epithelial cells in first-trimester decidua. However, it is associated with vascular smooth muscle cells in endometrium and decidua. CC25 promises to be a useful reagent for the analysis of endometrial function during the menstrual cycle.\r"

Attention was focused on the preterm group of patients to assess the implications of presenting symptoms, the usefulness of ultrasonography, and the safety and efficacy of tocolysis. Cigarette smoking and a previous poor obstetric history were found to be more frequent in the preterm compared to the term abruptio placentae. Ultrasonic visualization of a clot was successful in 25% of the preterm patients but otherwise appeared to have little or no impact on course or management. Tocolysis for the preterm patients appeared to be beneficial in prolonging gestation and did not increase the likelihood of cesarean delivery, hemorrhage, or fetal distress. The cumulative rates of delivery following admission were compared with and without tocolysis, with and without sonographic visualization of a clot, and overall as a function of gestational age at initial hospitalization. Perinatal mortality was 17%. Inpatient management with frequent fetal heart rate monitoring, tocolysis if indicated, and timely use of cesarean delivery are advocated to promote prolongation of the pregnancy and minimized perinatal mortality.\r"

The women were examined every 3 months during the 2 years of treatment. Measurement of the bone mineral content in the forearms (single photon absorptiometry) and the spine and total skeleton (dual photon absorptiometry) showed a significant decrease of 5% to 7% in the placebo group during the 2 years of treatment, whereas it remained constant in all bone compartments in the estradiol group. Addition of progesterone did not influence the results. Biochemical estimates of calcium metabolism changed toward a premenopausal level in the estradiol group but remained unchanged in the placebo group.

Percutaneous estradiol was given alone during the first year of treatment and in combination with oral micronized progesterone (200 mg) for 12 days of each cycle during the second year. The women were examined every 3 months throughout the 2 years. Percutaneous estrogen therapy significantly reduced total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas no significant differences were observed in serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Addition of oral progesterone during the second year of treatment did not produce any significant alterations in serum total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, both of which remained significantly reduced. Serum triglycerides remained virtually unchanged, whereas a slight but significant increase (p less than 0.05) was observed in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at the end of the study period. We conclude that percutaneous estrogen administration produces changes in total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels similar to those observed after oral estrogen administration. However, the magnitude and time course of the response seem to be modulated by the route of administration. Addition of oral micronized progesterone does not influence the beneficial estrogenic actions on serum lipids and lipoproteins and seems to be a proper \"progestogen\" in percutaneous estrogen therapy.\r"

Group B streptococci strains 893 and 891 proliferated rapidly at rates similar to their rates in Todd-Hewitt Broth. Strain 878 grew at a rate slower than that of strains 893 and 891.

Second- and third-trimester amniotic fluid supports the growth of group B streptococci as well as a culture medium optimized for bacterial growth. Strain-specific variance in group B streptococci growth rates in amniotic fluid may have clinical significance for those at risk for group B streptococci infection.\r"

We performed a 10-mm penetrating keratoplasty that extended from the superior margin of the previously placed graft to the inferior corneoscleral limbus to encompass the ulcerated cornea. Histopathologic examination of tissue removed at surgery disclosed that the peripheral corneal ulcer extended nearly through the entire stromal thickness and that the donor corneal stroma adjacent to the ulcer was infiltrated with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. The conjunctiva adjacent to the peripheral corneal ulcer was packed with plasma cells and also showed some lymphocytes and neutrophils.\r"

In the eye, S-antigen immunoreactivity was present in all retinoblastomas examined, as well as one retinocytoma characterized by benign appearing cells including fleurettes. S-antigen immunoreactivity was focally present in two of the four brain tumors examined. Additionally, two intraocular medulloepitheliomas, one of which contained well-defined rosettes, and 16 primary intracranial tumors, including seven pineal gland tumors and nine other lesions, some of which histopathologically may resemble retinoblastoma, were examined. S-antigen immunoreactivity was observed in two pineal gland tumors but not the remaining nine primary intracranial neoplasms or the two intraocular medulloepitheliomas. Our results further substantiate the immunologic relationship between the retina and the pineal gland, and tumors originating in these tissues.\r"

As with PLP-fixed frozen sections, the following antigens were clearly demonstrated in the tissue sections processed with the present method: T (Leu-1, Leu-2a, Leu-3a, Leu-4, OKT3, OKT4, OKT8), B (B1, B2, Leu-14, IgM, IgD) lymphocyte surface markers and other antigens (Leu-7, OKT6, OKT9, OKM1, OKI1, J5, Ki-1, Ki-67, TdT, oncogene Ha-ras P21).

All tumors were also assayed biochemically for ER with the dextran-coated charcoal method (DCC). The comparison of biochemically and immunocytochemically determined ER status showed concordant results in 80% (P less than 0.0001). In only 2 cases (1%) with low ER levels (less than 20 fmol/mg protein) immunocytochemistry failed to detect ER. ER positivity determined with a semiquantified approach based on intensity and heterogeneity of immunocytochemical staining correlated significantly with biochemically determined ER levels (P = 0.0001). In a series of fine-needle aspirates of 34 breast carcinomas sufficient cell material was available for ER immunocytochemistry (ER-ICA). Overall, the results of ER-ICA in fine-needle aspirates were concordant with ER-ICA in histologic specimens in 88% of the samples. In a few cases with weak positivity of ER-ICA in histologic specimens, ER-ICA was negative in fine-needle aspirates. In no case was there a false-positive immunocytochemical ER determination in a tumor aspirate. Thus, ER-ICA seems to be a reliable assay which can be performed in histologic and cytologic specimens.\r"

Antifibronectin antibodies were used as mesangial markers. In normal human glomeruli, vimentin antibodies stained endothelial cells, podocytes, and mesangial cells; desmin antibodies, surprisingly, stained podocytes. In normal rat glomeruli, the pattern of vimentin staining was the same as in humans, but desmin antibodies stained both mesangial cells and podocytes. In human and rat glomeruli cytokeratin staining was confined to segments of Bowman's capsule. In human pathologic glomeruli, vimentin and desmin antibodies stained the structures that were positive in normal glomeruli, giving a characteristic pattern for each pathologic condition examined. These results are compatible with the mesenchymal origin of podocytes and mesangial cells and suggest that both cells have smooth muscle-like phenotypic features. Mesangial cells may have slightly different differentiation paths in humans and rats, leading to a distinct expression of intermediate filament proteins.\r"

Multiple biopsy specimens from the same individual were studied in order to evaluate temporal as well as topographic consistency of the results. In addition, the expression of the Lewis antigens in the appendiceal mucosa was investigated in 9 of these patients. The antibodies against Lea reacted with the urothelium of all patients with either Lea+b- or Lea-b+ RBC phenotype. None of the 5 patients with Lea-b- RBCs had Lea urothelial reactivity. The antibodies against Leb reacted with the urothelium of all patients with Lea+b- or Lea-b+ RBCs and with 2 of the 5 patients with Lea-b- RBCs. The mucin in the goblet cells of the appendiceal mucosa was positive only for the Lewis antigen that was also detectable of the individual's RBCs. These findings indicate that the expression of Lewis antigens in nonsecretory epithelia may not follow the same principles as in the blood and secretions.\r"

Very long chain fatty acids, abnormal bile acids, including bile acid precursors (di- and trihydroxycoprostanoic acids), and C29-dicarboxylic acid accumulated in plasma in both patients. Generalized hyperaminoaciduria was also present. Peroxisomes could not be detected in CHRS liver and kidney; however, in the NALD patient, small and sparse cytoplasmic bodies resembling altered peroxisomes were found in hepatocytes. Hepatocellular and Kupffer cell lysosomes were engorged with ferritin and contained clefts and trilaminar structures believed to represent very long chain fatty acids. Enzymatic deficiencies reflected the peroxisomal defects. Hepatic glycolate oxidase and palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activities were deficient. No particle-bound catalase was found in cultured fibroblasts, and ether glycerolipid (plasmalogen) biosynthesis was markedly reduced. Administration of phenobarbital and clofibrate, an agent that induces peroxisomal proliferation and enzymatic activities, to the NALD patient did not bring about any changes in plasma metabolites, liver peroxisome population, or oxidizing activities.\r"

After immunization, all mice had high serum levels of antibodies to TH; immune deposits consisting of IgG antibodies to TH and TH formed at the base of cells of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (ALH) and distal convoluted tubule. These basal complexes were maximal in number and size within the cortical ALH, where they often radiated toward the luminal surfaces. Although the highest anti-TH antibody titers were found in animals with the most extensive deposits, antibody levels were not directly proportional to IgG deposits or to the time after immunization. The larger immune deposits were visualized by light microscopy as PAS-positive deposits. The quantity of these deposits was proportional to the time after immunization and was directly related to anti-TH antibody levels. Electron microscopy showed that these immune deposits were present within the basal and lateral intercellular spaces of the cells of the ALH. The distribution and localization of TH within the normal mouse kidney was very similar to that in rats. However, the distribution of immune complexes within the distal nephron in mice differed from rats similarly treated with TH and indicates either species differences in the distribution and/or organization of TH associated with tubular cell surfaces or that the accessibility of distal tubules to antibodies is species-dependent.\r"

  ".U": "87097628\r", 
  ".W": "Thermal injury is well known to inhibit functions of the circulating neutrophil related to its role in host defense against infection, but the mechanism(s) of this phenomenon are not fully understood. To gain further clues to these mechanisms, the authors have studied patients with thermal injury in terms of altered expression of neutrophil cell membrane receptors for the opsonic complement-derived ligand C3bi--complement receptor Type 3, or CR3. CR3 expression was selected for study because an increase in the number of receptors on the cell surface can be stimulated by products of complement activation known to accumulate after thermal injury and because of the role of CR3 in phagocytic and adherence functions of the neutrophil. Expression of CR3 was monitored semiquantitatively by flow cytometry with the use of a murine monoclonal antibody (OKM1) specific for an antigen (CD11) associated with this receptor. Patients evaluated were limited in this study to those with minor degrees of thermal injury (second-degree burn involving less than 20% of total body surface area) so that possible confounding effects of major injury and its complications could be eliminated. It was observed that patient neutrophil CR3 becomes significantly up-regulated during the first week, as early as 1 day after injury. The maximum level of expression of CR3 averaged greater than 150% (range, 70-314%) of the respective minimum level observed for each patient. The minimum levels of expression of CR3 on patient neutrophils, reached 11-37 days after injury for 7 of 8 patients, were comparable to the level of expression of CR3 on unstimulated control neutrophils. Such temporal up-regulation of patient neutrophil CR3 suggests the early generation of stimuli of CR3 mobilization in response to thermal injury. Increased numbers of CR3 on patient neutrophils may augment microbicidal function and enhance or inhibit delivery of cells to the burn site.\r"

Tissue studies of secretory immunoglobulins in the kidney are scanty, mostly related to nephropathies with IgA. Renal tissues from 37 autopsies selected for any history of renal dysfunction were processed for immunohistologic studies on frozen sections with several antisera, including a purified rabbit anti-human secretory component (SC). By immunohistology, gel diffusion, and immunoblotting, the anti-SC antibody reacted appropriately with purified human SC, saliva, intestinal epithelium, and breast milk and did not cross-react with immunoglobulin heavy or light chains, lactoferrin, and other tissue proteins. IgA and SC were seen in tubular casts in 70% of patients, whereas less impressive staining with IgM, IgG, and albumin was seen, respectively, in 24%, 13%, and 22% of the patients. SC was present in the cytoplasm of distal tubule and Henle's loop cells in 78% of specimens. A control group of 10 healthy individuals who died suddenly showed minimal staining of casts and tubules in 2 specimens. Renal pathology in the group with IgA-SC+ casts included acute tubular necrosis (54%), severe chronic renal disease (61%), and mild chronic renal injury (38%). The group with negative IgA-SC casts included acute tubular necrosis (64%), infectious interstitial nephritis (36%), and negligible renal disease (36%). This study suggests that discrete distal segments of the nephron may have the capability of secreting SC, which is probably coupled with serum-derived IgA and incorporated into luminal tubular secretions. The low level of immunosecretions in kidneys which are normal or minimally damaged suggests that this system may need to be turned on by unknown, probably pathogenic stimulating factors.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the authors describe the use of dietary taurine to protect hamster lung epithelium from acute nitrogen dioxide (NO2) injury. The conclusions were based on histologic, ultrastructural, and freeze-fracture analyses. Hamsters were pretreated for 14 days with 0.5% taurine in their drinking water. They were then exposed to either 7 or 30 ppm NO2 for 24 hours. The lungs from animals of these experimental groups were compared with those from hamsters treated with only NO2, and those given only taurine and with untreated controls. After treatment, hamsters were anesthetized and perfusion-fixed through the right side of the heart with a solution containing 1% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2 M cacodylate. The trachea and lungs were removed en bloc and stored overnight in cacodylate buffer at 4 C. Terminal and respiratory bronchioles, including alveolar ducts and peribronchiolar alveoli, were dissected from each lobe and processed for embedding in Epon and freeze-fracture replication. Light and transmission electron microscopy revealed the typical inflammatory cell infiltrate in the bronchiolar and alveolar duct regions in the lungs of hamsters exposed to NO2. The bronchiolar epithelium appeared flattened because of loss and breakage of cilia on ciliated cells and apical protrusions of Clara cells. Clara-cell secretory granules were reduced or absent. Freeze-fracture replicas of tight junctions of bronchiolar epithelium analyzed by morphometric techniques demonstrated a reduction and fragmentation of fibrils. Only animals exposed to 30 ppm NO2 exhibited physiologic intercellular penetration of horseradish peroxidase. Hamsters pretreated with taurine and then exposed to NO2 showed none of these alterations. They exhibited the same morphologic features as the untreated controls and the hamsters treated only with taurine. On the basis of this evidence, it is suggested that prophylactic dietary taurine can prevent acute NO2-induced morphologic lung injury. Taurine may also be effective in preventing lung injury induced by other oxidant gases.\r"

The failure of parental empathy to meet those needs during childhood results in the inability to develop intrapsychic structures that can reliably regulate self-esteem and calm the self, leaving the person overly dependent on those in the surround to provide those functions. Treatment requires careful understanding of the early failures and provides an environment in which the intrapsychic structures may belatedly and effectively develop.\r"

A case-control study of cases and age and sex-matched controls showed an association with attendance at a southern Oklahoma lake (14/17 cases vs 3/17 controls, matched pair odds ratio [OR] 9/0, confidence interval [CI] 2.4-infinity). A survey of 85 persons who had visited the lake area showed that persons who had swum were more likely to have been ill with a gastrointestinal illness (50 per cent) than persons who had not swum (0 per cent); among those who had swum, illness was more frequent among those who reported having water in their mouths while swimming (62 per cent) than those who did not (19 per cent) (OR = 6.9, 95% CI = 2.2-21.5). No further primary lake-associated cases had onset of symptoms beyond two days of closing the reservoir. Swimming should be considered as a potential source of enteric infections.\r"

In this study a model was developed to study the biological and biomechanical characteristics of a patellar tendon autograft used for ACL reconstruction. Specifically it was hypothesized that since vascularity of these grafts reflects their \"healthiness,\" strength and vascularity should be inversely related in the early period after implantation. Using an over the top technique, a patellar tendon graft was placed in three groups of dogs and studied at 37, 57, and 120 days. Vascularity of the grafts was measured using technetium-tagged red blood cells, and percent water by weight was determined by dessication. Tensile testing to failure was performed using an MTS machine. The grafts became more vascular, more hydrated, less stiff, and less strong (by 4 weeks) than controls. By 16 weeks the vascular response was subsiding but the grafts remained only 40% as strong as controls. Percent water increased significantly over controls for all time periods. Decrease in strength correlated poorly with vascularity but correlated well with increase in percent water. These findings suggest that the change in strength of an intraarticular ACL replacement relates more to a basic rearrangement of its collagen-ground substance relationships, and that vascularity may reflect the inflammatory response bringing about these changes. The model developed in this study serves as a basis for further studies, and the findings reveal important information about the behavior of ACL grafting materials.\r"

The insulin and glucagon responses to hyperglycemia alone or in the presence of splanchnic nerve stimulation were similar in magnitude to the results obtained in a preliminary report on isolated human pancreatic function and in studies using animal models. Stimulation of the celiac neural bundle in the presence of hyperglycemia resulted in an inhibition of insulin release and in an augmentation of glucagon release. alpha-adrenergic stimulation resulted in a strong suppression of insulin secretion and a mild suppression of glucagon secretion. beta-adrenergic fiber stimulation caused a mild augmentation of both insulin and glucagon release, whereas the cholinergic fibers strongly stimulated both alpha- and beta-cell secretion. The predominant effects of celiac neural bundle stimulation are insulin inhibition by was of an alpha-adrenergic effect and glucagon stimulation by way of a cholinergic effect. Thus, in this in vitro human model, our data confirm that the splanchnic innervation of the pancreas has a potent regulatory role on pancreatic hormone release in human subjects.\r"

The rebirth of vagotomy in 1943 by Dragstedt was based on cumulative new data supporting the concept that vagal denervation should favorably influence the clinical course of duodenal ulcer. This now proved concept renders vagotomy in some form a basic part of all operations for duodenal ulcer. The Dragstedt operation, vagotomy and pyloroplasty, is particularly useful in cases of acute bleeding and obstruction. Vagotomy and antrectomy has the lowest ulcer recurrence rate. Parietal cell vagotomy has the lowest mortality and morbidity rates and is the procedure of choice in patients with uncomplicated, intractable duodenal ulcer.\r"

Significant increases of retinoids were also found in lungs, trachea, kidneys, and testes, but not in the eyes. These increases in extrahepatic tissues contrasted strikingly with the concomitant decrease in the liver and suggests that chronic ethanol consumption may be associated with some mobilization of vitamin A from the liver to other organs.\r"

Parenteral drug abusers (n = 34) were significantly younger than alcohol abusers (n = 23) or abusers of both (n = 147) and had lower levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase than the other two groups. Chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis were more frequent (p less than 0.001) in abusers of parenteral drugs alone, whereas cirrhosis was found most often (p less than 0.001) in abusers of both alcohol and parenteral drugs. Cirrhosis was present in 10 of 39 (26%) simultaneous abusers of alcohol and parenteral drugs compared with 58 of 96 (60%) alcohol-abusing former parenteral drug abusers (p less than 0.001). Methadone maintenance treatment was not associated with cirrhosis. Thus, methadone-maintained patients who abuse alcohol and develop cirrhosis should remain in methadone maintenance treatment and receive concomitant alcoholism treatment. Also, these data further support the hypothesis that abusers of both alcohol and parenteral drugs have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that acutely administered ethanol could interfere with neocortical recurrent inhibition (RI) was supported. The large surface negative wave in response to antidromic stimulation of the cerebral peduncle represents a summation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, a measure of RI. In acute experiments on adult rats, blood alcohol levels of less than about 120 mg/100 ml slightly facilitated the surface negative wave. Higher blood alcohol levels always blocked the surface negative response. Stimulation of the somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei produced a cortical response on which ethanol had a moderate blocking effect. Conditioning-test procedures revealed that cerebral peduncle stimulation strongly blocked the thalamocortical (test) response, especially after ethanol, but thalamic stimulation (conditioning) had no effect upon the surface negative wave. This demonstrates a differential effect on the two cortical processes. Cortical RI seems to be especially sensitive to blood alcohol level, but the function of cortical RI is complex. By way of acting on RI, ethanol likely affects control of sensory input and cortical sensory organization as well as selectivity and magnitude of motor discharge.\r"

In terminal acute experiments, spontaneous neuronal discharges in pair-fed and naive rats were inhibited by epicortical stimulation, a procedure known to produce postsynaptic inhibition. Few units in CET rats were inhibited by such stimulation. Cortical recurrent inhibition, indicated by a surface-negative potential in response to antidromic stimulation of the cerebral peduncle, was little affected by a challenge dose of ethanol, compared with the response in pair-fed animals. Recurrent inhibition involves inhibitory interneurons. CET apparently made inhibitory interneurons and inhibitory postsynaptic receptors less responsive to ethanol. Apical dendritic spines on some portions of pyramidal neurons increased in number with CET. This could reflect a compensatory growth in neurons not damaged by CET. The overall observations are consistent with ethanol affecting one or more specific systems of cortical motor control as opposed to its presumed general disinhibitory effect.\r"

We found that significant production of acetaldehyde occurred in vitro after incubation of human bronchopulmonary washings with 25 mM ethanol. Acetaldehyde production was increased in active smokers and related to microorganisms in the bronchopulmonary tract. It was abolished by preincubation of the washings with antibiotics and was reproduced in vitro with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Normal pulmonary cells in bronchopulmonary washings did not produce acetaldehyde from ethanol.\r"

These changes include depression of protein synthesis with acetaldehyde in the acute experiment, in vitro, and after chronic ethanol ingestion in vivo. The present studies were initiated to see if the inhibition of protein synthesis following prolonged ethanol ingestion involved myocardial contractile proteins. Newly weaned guinea pigs, weighing 350 g, were placed on a regimen of normal laboratory diet with 10% ethanol in the drinking water. Calorie-matched controls, drinking dextromaltose in the water, were simultaneously run. After 40 weeks of ingesting 10% ethanol in the drinking water, hearts from growing guinea pigs were removed and synthesis of myocardial contractile proteins (myosin heavy chains, light chains (LC1, LC2), actin, and tropomyosin) assayed in vitro with 3H-labeled amino acids. With aging, there was a decrease in the rates of synthesis of all the contractile proteins. After 40 weeks of ethanol ingestion, the synthetic rates of myosin heavy and light chains and tropomyosin were the same as in calorie-matched controls, but the synthetic rate of actin was significantly decreased by 20% (p less than 0.01). This decrease in actin synthesis may be the first indication of ultimate inhibition of synthesis of all the contractile proteins which may lead to myofibrillar disorganization and vacuolization reported after chronic ethanol ingestion.\r"

However, degradation of Ac-CHO in the liver, especially with respect to the relative amounts produced by the two pathways, remains unclear. In order to clarify the metabolic fates of Ac-CHO produced by the two pathways, the ethanol metabolic rate (EMR) and hepatic Ac-CHO levels in the rats fed an alcohol-containing or control diet for 4 weeks were determined after a single administration or constant infusion of ethanol, with or without 4-methylpyrazole pretreatment. The EMR was increased in chronic alcoholic rats and decreased by treatment with 4-methylpyrazole. Consequently, blood and hepatic Ac-CHO levels were low in the pyrazole-treated rats in both the single dose and infusion experiments. Hepatic Ac-CHO levels and EMR were well correlated in both experiments. However, the correlations were curve linear and the slopes of the regression lines in the pyrazole-treated rats were steeper than those in the nontreated rats. When the ratios of hepatic Ac-CHO (subtracted by a constant which was obtained from the correlation equations for the curvilinear fit of hepatic Ac-CHO levels and EMR) to EMR were calculated, they were significantly higher in the pyrazole-treated rats than in the nontreated rats of the perfusion experiment, without relation to chronic alcohol ingestion. These results suggest that Ac-CHO produced by the non-ADH pathway degrades more slowly than that produced by the ADH pathway in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased urinary output (Vu ml/min) after institution of PEEP is attributed to a variety of mechanisms including decreased cardiac output and renal blood flow (RBF), activation of neurohormonal reflexes, increased catecholamines, plasma renin activity (PRA), and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release. To evaluate these factors, seven normovolemic patients (36 yr +/- 13 SD), free of preexisting lung, cardiac, or renal disease, requiring continuous mandatory ventilation for neurologic reasons were studied. The authors measured or calculated: total blood volume (TBV) (51Cr); right atrial, pulmonary arterial, pulmonary wedge, and systemic pressures, cardiac index (CI); renal plasma flow (RPF) (iodohippurate sodium 131I [131I PAH] clearance); glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (creatinine clearance), free water clearance (CH2O), osmolal clearance (Cosm), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) and potassium (FEK+); and plasma renin activity (PRA) (ng X ml-1 X h-1), plasma ADH (pg/ml; radioimmunoassay), epinephrine (E in pg/ml), and norepinephrine (NE in pg/ml) (double-isotope radioenzymatic assay). Two conditions were studied after 90-min steady state: 1) zero PEEP (ZEEP); and 2) 15 cmH2O PEEP. PEEP caused a significant decrease in CI (-21%; P less than 0.01) and RPF (-19%; P less than 0.05) without significant decrease in GFR. A significant decrease in Vu (-55%; P less than 0.05), FENa+ (-39%; P less than 0.05) and Cosm (-36%; P less than 0.25) occurred without modification in CH2O. Plasma ADH remained in the normal range and did not increase when PEEP was applied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hepatic microsomes were prepared, and the oxidative defluorination of enflurane, isoflurane, and methoxyflurane and the reductive defluorination of halothane were measured in vitro. In diabetic rats the defluorination of enflurane was increased 3.4-fold over control levels in vivo and 2.7-fold in vitro. Insulin treatment prevented these effects. In vitro metabolism of isoflurane by livers from diabetic rats was 2.5-fold greater than by livers from control rats, but defluorination of methoxyflurane and of halothane was not altered. The results show that streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats enhances the defluorination of enflurane and of isoflurane but not of methoxyflurane or halothane.\r"

Ten minutes after the ipecac was administered, an aqueous slurry of 50 g activated charcoal diluted to 500 mL was instilled down the nasogastric tube and the tube was removed. Emetic response and time to emesis were recorded. Thirty minutes after emesis subsided, a second dose of 50 g activated charcoal (with sorbitol) was administered orally. Emetic responses were noted in all ten patients. The patients averaged 3.7 emetic episodes. Emesis commenced in an average of 13.8 minutes from the start of ipecac administration and concluded in an average of 45.9 minutes. These results in patients are similar to those observed in a previously reported volunteer group similarly treated. This protocol allows early administration of activated charcoal while preserving the emetic properties of syrup of ipecac in the patients treated.\r"

The severity of emphysema was graded by the panel grading method using whole lung, paper-mounted (Gough-Wentworth) sections and the mean linear intercept (Lm). The FEV1 and FEF25-75 of the FVC, the DLCO, the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and subdivisions of lung volumes showed significant but low order correlations with the emphysema score and Lm. Total lung capacity, determined by plethysmography, was better related to emphysema in this study than in others in which TLC was measured by helium dilution. Volume-pressure data fitted to the exponential equation (V = A - Be-KP) yielded a low order, but a significant relationship between Lm and the exponential constant (K), but not between K and the panel emphysema score. We conclude that the recognition of the presence and severity of emphysema continues to require a multivariate approach including clinical history, assessment of air-flow obstruction via routine spirometry, radiologic assessment of the lung with emphasis on total lung capacity, and evaluation of the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide.\r"

Negative pressure ventilators may be partially effective in these patients but can cause upper airway obstructive apneas. We examined the effectiveness of positive pressure ventilation through a nose mask in preventing nocturnal hypoxemia and compared it with negative pressure systems. We reasoned that nasal positive pressure would provide stability for the upper airway. Five patients with neuromuscular disorders underwent a series of all-night sleep studies under control conditions, negative pressure ventilation, and positive pressure ventilation through a comfortable nose mask. Sleep staging and respiratory variables were monitored during all studies. Daytime awake lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and arterial blood gases were also measured. The severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia that occurred under control conditions were prevented by positive pressure ventilation through a nose mask. Negative pressure ventilation improved NREM ventilation in all patients, but did not prevent severe oxyhemoglobin desaturation, which occurred during REM sleep. Negative pressure ventilation appears to contribute to upper airways obstruction during REM sleep as evidenced by cessation of air flow, reduced chest wall movements, falls in arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, and hypercapnia. With treatment, daytime PaO2 improved from a mean of 70 to 83 mm Hg, and PaCO2 decreased from a mean of 61 to 46 mm Hg. We conclude that nasally applied positive pressure ventilation is a highly effective method of providing nocturnal assisted ventilation because it stabilizes the oropharyngeal airway.\r"

The patients received either placebo or 5 mg/kg of caffeine in solution orally, and FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax25 and blood for caffeine concentrations were taken at several time points for as long as 8 h after the drink. Results: there was a significant difference between caffeine and placebo for percent change in FEV1 with peak change at 1.5 h. There was also a significant difference for percent change in FEF25-75 with peak occurring at 4 h. Percent change in Vmax25 was significantly different at 3.0 h only. Peak caffeine concentration of 8.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml occurred at 1 h.

  ".W": "The effect of bradykinin was studied by inhalation in normal and asthmatic human subjects, as well as on human bronchial smooth muscle in vitro. Bradykinin caused cough and retrosternal discomfort in all subjects and bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects. Bradykinin was approximately 10 times more potent than histamine and methacholine, and there was a significant correlation between the subjects' sensitivity to histamine and bradykinin. Bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction was prolonged when compared with that of histamine and the C-fiber stimulant capsaicin. This bronchoconstriction was subject to tachyphylaxis, which was also associated with desensitization of the subjects to inhaled histamine. The provocative dose causing a 35% fall in specific airway conductance (PD35) was unaffected by aspirin (1 g orally). However, ipratropium bromide (0.25 mg by nebulizer) significantly inhibited the effect of bradykinin, the PD35 being 0.8 mumol (range, 0.16 to 3.4) and 0.15 mumol (range, 0.047 to 1.15) after active dose and placebo, respectively (p less than 0.05). Likewise, cromolyn sodium (40 mg dry powder) also significantly reduced response to bradykinin, with a PD35 of 0.04 mumol (range, 0.13 to 0.31) after placebo and 0.39 mumol (range, 0.05 to 4.45) after SCG (p less than 0.05). Bradykinin only weakly constricted human bronchial smooth muscle in vitro. Bradykinin at 10(-4) caused only 21.5 +/- 5.5% of the maximal carbamylcholine contraction in 11 of 18 airways. Captopril did not enhance the effect of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a potent bronchoconstrictor of human airways in vivo, acting in part through cholinergic mechanisms but not because of the formation of prostaglandins.\r"

An initial concentration-response curve to methacholine was constructed to identify the concentration required to cause a twofold to threefold rise in mean pulmonary resistance (RL). Using this concentration, 3 consecutive challenges (C1, C2, and C3) were then performed at 30-min intervals in 4 groups of cats. After a control challenge (C1), the parasympathetic (n = 9), sympathetic (n = 6), or both branches (n = 4) of the cervical vagosympathetic trunks were sectioned. Sham cats (n = 7) showed reproducible increases in RL (C1, delta RL = 15.1 +/- 2.7 cm H2O X 1(-1) X s; C2, delta RL = 15.7 +/- 3.0; C3, delta RL = 13.1 +/- 2.9; mean +/- 1 SE). After parasympathectomy there was an increase in responsiveness after C3 (C1, delta RL = 15.0 +/- 4.3; C2, delta RL = 16.4 +/- 6.4; C3, delta RL = 29.9 +/- 11.6; p less than 0.01). Sympathectomy and vagosympathectomy did not significantly alter responsiveness. The results suggest that vagally mediated inhibitory influences modulate the bronchial response to aerosolized methacholine in the cat.\r"

Therefore, neither the patient nor his/her insurance carrier should foot the bill, yet. The cost involved in analysis of BAL fluid and serum raises another consideration about how many things need to be measured and what tests give the essential information and are the most discriminating. Clearly, all of the assays suggested by some of the BAL results given in table 2 are not necessary. The cell count and the differential count, indicating the relative percentage of lymphocytes among the respiratory cells, and monoclonal antibody staining to distinguish the various T-cell subtypes give most of the essential cell information that relates to activity of alveolitis and to diagnosis in the interstitial lung diseases. Finding a very high percentage of lymphocytes in BAL fluid shifts the differential diagnosis in an unknown diffuse interstitial lung disease to the possibility of a granulomatous process, especially sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis; whereas elevated PMN with about 3% eosinophils also present suggests possible idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many of the protein and enzyme assays have a role in describing immunopathogenesis, but are rarely measured until a few days after the procedure. Some quite sophisticated cell mediators can be measured, such as interleukin-2 produced by helper T-lymphocytes and many macrophage effector substances that may give more precise information than just cell counts and various immunoglobulin values. These assays require complex biochemical and cell culture work and are only available in special research laboratories, limiting the availability of such tests. Thus, it is not easy to suggest just what tests should be conducted with BAL cells and fluid to tailor costs yet give comprehensive clinical information, too. The use of BAL to obtain cells and proteins lining the alveolar space in many ways is still in its infancy, and new applications are being sought for a substantial list of lung diseases. Just the tip of the iceberg has been investigated, and much more may remain to be uncovered.\r"

An increased and dose-related production was found in AM for as long as 2 h after a 40-min exposure. No production was detectable after 4 h. Prolonging the exposure did not prolong the response. When a second exposure was given, no PAF could be detected until the time interval between the 2 exposures was 72 h. The amount of neutrophils in lung lavage fluid was elevated about 100 times at 4 h after the exposure, but only a minor PAF production was found in these cells. In view of the role of LPS-contaminated dusts for the development of human lung disease, particularly airway constriction, the role of PAF needs to be further investigated.\r"

Ketanserin blocked the 5-HT-induced increases in airway and pulmonary artery pressures, whereas the increases in airway and pulmonary artery pressures caused by norepinephrine, PGF2 alpha, or angiotensin II were not significantly modified by ketanserin, indicating a relatively high degree of specificity for 5-HT2 receptors. The role of endogenous 5-HT in mediating endotoxin-induced respiratory failure was evaluated by treating pigs with ketanserin. Escherichia coli endotoxin (055-B5) was infused intravenously into anesthetized 10- to 14-wk-old pigs at 5 micrograms/kg the first h, followed by 2 micrograms/kg/h for 3.5 h. Ketanserin was infused at 300 micrograms/kg before endotoxin plus 67 micrograms/kg/h during endotoxemia. During Phase 1 (i.e., 0 to 2 h), the endotoxin-induced increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and room air alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and the decreased cardiac index and lung dynamic compliance were not significantly modified by ketanserin. However, during Phase 2 (i.e., 2 to 4.5 h) endotoxemia, ketanserin attenuated the endotoxin-induced pulmonary hypertension and the increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, alveolar dead space ventilation, and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Ketanserin also attenuated the Phase 2 bronchoconstriction and the decreased cardiac index, but did not modify the endotoxin-induced increase in alveolar-capillary permeability. These results indicate that 5-HT plays little or no role in mediating the early (i.e., less than 2 h) response to endotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The wound did not heal after repeated debridement, closed irrigation of the mediastinum with povidone-iodine solution, and antimycoplasmal chemotherapy; muscle flap grafting was eventually required. Two infections occurred in recipients of heart-lung transplants after the isolation of mycoplasma from bronchial secretions. Although no Mycoplasma species were isolated after specific antimycoplasmal therapy was begun, the wounds still did not heal. Both patients died of other complications. Infection of wounds after sternotomy is another of an increasing number of infections caused by M. hominis in the normal and immunocompromised host. Familiarity with the morphologic characteristics of M. hominis on bacteriologic culture media may increase the recognition of this pathogen in atypical clinical settings.\r"

Compared with patients who received conventional immunosuppression, patients treated with cyclosporine had a lower rate of infectious complications, and the contribution of infection to observed mortality was lower. Herpes simplex virus caused less morbidity and there were fewer active cytomegalovirus infections in seropositive recipients treated with cyclosporine. The incidence of bacterial pulmonary infections and associated bacteremia also decreased impressively. A decrease in nocardial infections was offset by a rise in those due to Legionella species. The frequency of aspergillosis was decreased by 54% in the cyclosporine-treated group, but half of these infections disseminated beyond the lung and such dissemination was always fatal. Infections with Pneumocystis carinii were significantly less common with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. Screening serologic tests for toxoplasma should be done routinely and consideration given to prophylaxis in heart transplant recipients at high risk.\r"

The antimicrobial agents were also more efficacious than placebo in treating diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, invasive enteropathogens, and unknown pathogens. Both antimicrobials were effective in treating mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe disease, and both were well tolerated. Ciprofloxacin appears to be a logical alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the initial treatment of acute travelers' diarrhea.\r"

Because there is no independent \"gold-standard\" procedure against which to evaluate this test, sensitivity and specificity can only be approximated. Sensitivity can be maximized by doing multiple cultures containing at least 10 mL of blood per set. Specificity can be maximized by adhering strictly to aseptic techniques and by requiring that multiple sets be positive for the series to be considered positive when the anticipated pathogens are also common contaminants. Two or three blood culture sets almost always suffice to establish or rule out bacteremia, although on some occasions obtaining more than three sets of cultures is indicated. One set is rarely, if ever, sufficient.\r"

New information about established immunosuppressive drugs and the introduction of new drugs are providing new opportunities for effective treatment of autoimmune diseases and improved effectiveness of organ transplantation.

Using these techniques, analysts have addressed many important clinical issues including screening for and prevention of disease, tradeoffs among tests and treatments, and the interpretation of clinical data under conditions of uncertainty. Problems with the approach remain and applications have not been extensive, but decision analysis is evolving as a powerful clinical tool and gradually is gaining acceptance in medical practice.\r"

The virtual coincidence of the discoveries of the rheumatoid factor, the lupus erythematosus cell, and cortisone in 1948-49 satisfied these requirements.

In contrast, an investigational aminothiazole cephem, CGP 31523A, produced a new combination of antibacterial effects: it was highly bactericidal without causing cell wall degradation or lysis. Killing was associated with the formation of vacuolated filaments. Because the compound bound to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1a and 3, we investigated the role of PBP 3 in modulation of lysis caused by inhibition of PBP 1a. A temperature-sensitive mutant with a nonfunctional PBP 3 lysed when treated with CGP 31523A. The combination of a PBP 1 inhibitor (cefsulodin) and a PBP 3 inhibitor (aztreonam) also caused filamentation and death without lysis of wild-type cells over a narrow concentration range. We conclude that cooperative effects between PBPs in E. coli can lead to a dissociation of bacterial killing and lysis.\r"

A single polypeptide with an Mr of 27,000 was encoded by the gene erxA and conferred high-level resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics by a mechanism other than drug inactivation. This resistance phenotype, not previously reported for a clinical isolate of enterobacteria, was probably due to modification of the ribosomes. The gene ereB encoded an enzyme with an Mr of 51,000 which inactivated erythromycin and oleandomycin. The two different mechanisms specified by erxA and ereB contributed in more than an additive fashion to the high level of resistance to erythromycin conferred by plasmid pIP1527 to E. coli BM2570.\r"

The DNCB contact sensitivity reactions, however, were generally diminished in vitiliginous skin, although the number of cases showing similar DNCB contact reactivity between normal and vitiliginous skin increased when the sensitization procedure was performed in vitiliginous skin instead of normal skin. On the other hand, delayed skin reactions to intradermally injected Candida albicans antigen were not suppressed in vitiliginous skin. The number of Langerhans' cells was not decreased in vitiliginous skin as compared with that of normal skin. The epidermal cells derived from vitiliginous skin, however, tended to show a lower stimulatory effect in the allogeneic mixed skin cell lymphocyte culture reaction than those from normal skin.

In an open study, patients receiving etretin therapy were followed up for a minimum of six months. An excellent or good response (greater than 50% clearance) was obtained in 18 of 21 patients. The incidence of mucocutaneous side effects from etretin therapy was similar to that previously reported with etretinate therapy. As a group, patients who received etretin therapy for six or more months showed no significant aberrations from normal levels of serum lipids or serum liver enzymes. However, five patients had mild elevation of liver enzymes or blood lipids, which were corrected by dose reduction. Etretin showed equivalent efficacy to that previously reported with etretinate in severe recalcitrant plaque psoriasis vulgaris. Taken with the reportedly more rapid clearance of etretin from the body, there may be clinical advantages of the use of etretin over the use of etretinate.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-nine renal allograft recipients were prospectively studied to determine the quantitative effects of different immunosuppression protocols on T-cell subsets (total lymphocytes [T3], helper/inducer [T4] and suppressor/cytotoxic [T8]). Eighteen patients were initially immunosuppressed with only azathioprine and prednisone but required subsequent treatment for rejection by the addition of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) or conversion to cyclosporine. Three of these patients had ATG-resistant rejections and were treated with the monoclonal antibody ORTHO OKT3 (ORTHO Pharmaceuticals, Raritan, NJ). Twenty-one patients were treated only with cyclosporine and prednisone. Plasma levels of cyclosporine, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, were kept in the range of 50-100 ng/mL (mean: 78.1 +/- 52.1). One patient had a lymphoma, two patients had failed grafts, and three patients converted their cytomegalovirus titers. The results demonstrate that the immunosuppressive agents, azathioprine, prednisone, and cyclosporine, have an additive effect in depressing the T-lymphocytes and their subsets. In addition, ATG and cyclosporine had a more selective ablation of the T4 subset, resulting in a reversal of the T4/T8 ratios. This depression was independent of the plasma level of cyclosporine. Finally, the pan T-cell monoclonal antibody OKT3 led to severe depletion of all T-cell subsets but resulted in a normal T4/T8 ratio. In conclusion, immunosuppressive agents have a variable effect on T-lymphocytes and their subsets that cannot be adequately characterized by the T4/T8 ratio alone, but which should be quantitatively assessed by examining all subsets.\r"

It occurred in 21 of 1415 patients (1.5%) admitted with Crohn's disease to The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1960 and 1983. The mean duration from onset of Crohn's disease to occurrence of perforation was 3.3 years. Ten patients had small bowel perforation, ten patients had large bowel perforation, and one patient had simultaneous perforation of both ileum and cecum. The incidence of perforation in disease segments of small bowel was 1.0% (jejunum 6.0%, ileum 0.7%), and in the colon, 1.3%. Besides the 21 patients with spontaneous free perforation, an additional nine patients had spontaneous free rupture of an abscess into the peritoneal cavity. The mean duration from onset of Crohn's disease to rupture of abscess was 8.5 years. All 30 patients had surgery within 24 hours of perforation or rupture. All 21 patients with spontaneous free perforations survived, as did all but one of the nine patients with perforated abscess. The cornerstone of the treatment of ileocolonic lesions perforating into the general peritoneal cavity is proximal diversion with delayed reconstruction of intestinal continuity whenever possible. With perforation of the small bowel, primary reanastomosis is possible in selected patients.\r"

A comparison of the rate of postoperative septic complications was made. After excluding drop-out patients, 261 patients remained for evaluation. In 135 patients with D + M treatment there were four postoperative septic complications (3.0%). In 126 patients with D treatment 20 septic complications related to the surgical procedure occurred (15.9%). The difference is highly significant (p less than 0.005). Most postoperative infections were superficial wound infections (14 of 24 patients), and the mean hospital stay in the two treatment groups was equal. Bacteriologic studies showed a highly significant reduction in anaerobes in cultures from perioperative intra-abdominal fluid in the D + M treatment group. The study has thus showed that the addition of metronidazole, an efficient agent against anaerobic bacteria, to an antimicrobial agent against aerobic bacteria significantly reduces postoperative septic complications in elective colorectal surgery.\r"

Both basal and stimulated release of insulin from isolated pancreatic islets, in vitro, were decreased significantly in cirrhotic rats, as compared with control rats. Basal, but not stimulated, levels of glucagon, in vitro, were reduced significantly in cirrhotic rats. Circulating levels of plasma insulin, glucagon, glucose, bilirubin, and amylase levels were unaffected in cirrhotic rats when compared with control rats. There were no signs of pancreatitis. The results indicated that the release of insulin and glucagon is depressed in cirrhotic rats and in rats treated with phenobarbitone and CCl4. Clearance of circulating insulin and glucagon by the liver was apparently reduced, since circulating levels of insulin and glucagon were unaltered in all treated rats.\r"

Malignant pleural mesotheliomas are locally aggressive and difficult to treat. They may be seen clinically as localized pleural tumors or as diffuse pleural disease with effusion and encasement of the lung and obliteration of the pleural space. The localized forms of malignant mesotheliomas are fibrosarcomatous. Their diagnosis and treatment do not differ from those for soft-part sarcomas seen elsewhere. Wide en-bloc excision is the treatment of choice and can be curative. The diffuse forms of malignant mesotheliomas are mainly epithelial. Treatment is generally unsatisfactory, and long-term survival is rare. Two surgical approaches are currently available: an extrapleural pneumonectomy and a pleurectomy with irradiation. The authors favor the latter approach because of its wider applicability, lower morbidity rate, and better survival advantage. Steps in selecting the best surgical mode of treatment are presented.\r"

However, most methods of cardioplegic delivery may not adequately cool and protect the right ventricle, and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction may limit hemodynamic recovery. Therefore, RV and LV temperatures were measured intraoperatively and RV and LV function were evaluated postoperatively in 80 patients with double-vessel or triple-vessel coronary artery disease who were randomized to receive either blood cardioplegia or crystalloid cardioplegia. Myocardial performance, systolic function, and diastolic function were assessed with nuclear ventriculography by evaluating the response to volume loading. Preoperatively the groups were similar. Intraoperatively, blood cardioplegia resulted in significantly warmer LV and RV temperatures (left ventricle: 15.5 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C with blood cardioplegia and 12.6 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C with crystalloid cardioplegia [p less than .0001]; right ventricle: 18.3 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C with blood cardioplegia and 15.1 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C with crystalloid cardioplegia [p less than .0001]). Postoperatively, blood cardioplegia resulted in better LV performance (higher LV stroke work index at a similar LV end-diastolic volume index [EDVI]) (p = .01), better LV systolic function (similar systolic blood pressures at smaller LV end-systolic volume indexes [ESVI]), (p = .04), and improved LV diastolic function (lower left atrial pressures at similar LVEDVIs) (p = .03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There are seven major reported series totaling 148 patients and six operative variations depending on the extent of myotomy and whether or not a hernia repair should be added. There are no five-year follow-up reports. In the present study of 34 patients followed for at least five years, all had a myotomy from the apex of the chest through the high-pressure zone and all had a total fundoplication hernia repair, 16 with gastroplasty and 16 with a standard Nissen fundoplication. The length of the completion fundoplication is reduced to less than 0.5 cm to avoid problems of overcompetence. There were no operative deaths. Follow-up is 100% by clinical history, 82.4% by radiology, and 61.8% by manometry. Radiological follow-up showed no recurrence or reflux, although 1 patient had esophageal mucus retention. Thirty patients (88.2%) are eating normally without dysphagia or spontaneous pain. Two patients (5.9%) have mild dysphagia, and 1 of them also has mild spontaneous pain. One patient has major residual dysphagia, which is being treated conservatively, and 1 has required colon interposition. Good-quality results have been achieved in 94% of patients now followed 5 to 10.7 years.\r"

In this prospective study, 18 previously normotensive subjects were studied before, during, and after CABG. In 4 patients (22%), paroxysmal postoperative hypertension developed (systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg). There were no differences between the normotensive and hypertensive groups in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II level, or aldosterone level. Despite the trend toward elevation of these variables during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), all had returned to control levels within two hours after CPB, whether or not hypertension developed. Serum norepinephrine levels were elevated (.10 greater than p greater than .05) in the hypertensive group at the time hypertension developed. No other relationship or pattern could be defined to distinguish the hypertensive from the normotensive group. The renin-angiotensin system does not appear to be responsible for paroxysmal hypertension following CABG.\r"

Selenium also deserves attention as a potential chemopreventive nutrient, though data are limited. Data on vitamin E are sparse and inconclusive, and there is little evidence that vitamin C provides protection against human lung cancer. It is likely that cessation of cigarette smoking would have a far greater influence on reducing lung cancer incidence than any known dietary modification.\r"

Physiological deterioration occurs with age, but it is not known how much is due to aging per se and how much is secondary to age-related disease and life-style. There are similar reservations about the changes in body composition that have been noted with increasing age. Many diseases are age related in terms of prevalence, but how these diseases relate to the primary aging processes remains to be defined. Finally, many claims have been made concerning interventions that will retard the aging processes; of these, only food restriction in rodents has been unequivocally shown to retard the aging processes of a mammalian species.\r"

Both drugs caused subtle but significant reductions in both parameters of sedation (critical flash fusion frequency and computerized Stroop Word Testing). Sedation was significantly related to serum concentrations of both drugs. The maximum drug-induced change was 17.2% +/- 9% for metoprolol and 19.6% +/- 3% for atenolol. The duration of effect was six hours after atenolol and two hours after metoprolol. Blood pressure control for all patients was similar during both treatment phases. These results demonstrate that relative lipid solubility does not reliably predict the neurologic effects of beta-blockers. The intensity of drug-induced sedation was similar, but the water-soluble agent produced a longer duration of sedative activity.\r"

Two complementary strategies were used simultaneously: a five-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled design (N = 38), and a plasma level/clinical response study (N = 30). Fifteen of the 16 children randomly assigned to active drug in the first study also participated in the second. Subjects were assessed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children and diagnosed according to unmodified Research Diagnostic Criteria. Response rates in the double-blind study were similar in both groups (imipramine, 56%; placebo, 68%). In the plasma level study, total maintenance plasma level (imipramine plus desipramine) was found to positively and linearly predict clinical response of the depressive syndrome (P less than .003). No evidence of a curvilinear relationship was found. Depressive hallucinations during the episode negatively predicted clinical response (P less than .05). Weight-corrected imipramine dosage did not predict either clinical response or plasma level in the individual subject. No predictors of response were found in the placebo group. These results suggest that the mean imipramine dosage was too low, and that future double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of imipramine in prepubertal major depression should include plasma level titration to above 150 ng/mL and an initial placebo washout period.\r"

A subsidiary advantage is that units of measurement used in clinical laboratories throughout the United States will be standardized as well. It is possible that expressing concentrations in moles per liter rather than as weight per volume will reveal clinically useful chemical relationships, but this remains unproved. Transition to Systeme International units will require use of different reference ranges, and there will be a potential for serious misinterpretation of laboratory data unless well-planned educational programs are instituted before the change.\r"

  ".W": "We describe light and electron microscopic findings in three cases of pulmonary infection caused by capsule-deficient Cryptococcus neoformans (CDCN) and emphasize the value of the Fontana-Masson silver (FMS) stain in diagnosing cryptococcosis. Capsule-deficient C neoformans infections, including coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, typical cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were used as controls. Several stains including mucicarmine, alcian blue, and FMS were done on tissue sections from all of the above mentioned infections. It was found that while the FMS stain was positive only in the organisms of CDCN and typical C neoformans, the mucicarmine was positive only in typical C neoformans. The negativity of the mucicarmine in the organisms of CDCN reflected the absence of capsular material as demonstrated by ultrastructural study. Therefore, when fungal cultures are not available or are negative, and tissue mucicarmine is negative, the FMS stain is a valuable alternative for use on tissue sections. It may be used, along with routine fungal stains, when a yeast-forming fungal infection is suspected.\r"

Macrophages (MCs) were present initially and remained relatively constant in number. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) response began at one to two hours and was maximal at 24 to 72 hours. A previously unidentified inoculum-dependent PMN response was defined. Clearance and phagocytosis were extremely rapid, and few (less than 3%) free bacteria were present after two hours. Phagocytic activity of MCs and PMNs was identical, but MCs were numerically predominant initially and thus accounted for the majority of early phagocytosis. Thus, MC phagocytosis and clearance represent the primary line of host peritoneal defenses. We hypothesize that the subsequent inoculum-dependent PMN response may have evolved to cope with those larger inocula for which this initial response is inadequate.\r"

To clarify the relationship between CMNA and evolving lung injury, we studied 26 patients with multiple trauma and sepsis within 24 hours of risk establishment for ARDS. Pulmonary alveolar-capillary permeability (PACP) was quantified as the clearance rate of a particulate radioaerosol. Seventeen patients (65%) had increased PACP (six developed ARDS) while nine (35%) had normal PACP (none developed ARDS; clearance rates of 3.4%/min and 1.5%/min, respectively). These patients, regardless of evidence of early lung injury, had elevated plasma C3adesArg levels and neutrophil chemotactic desensitization to C5a/C5adesArg. Plasma C3adesArg levels correlated weakly, but significantly, with PACP. Thus, CMNA may be a necessary, but not a sufficient, pathogenic mechanism in the evolution of ARDS.\r"

The broth cultures revealed significantly more isolations of potentially pathogenic bacteria and more accurately predicted the likelihood of wound infection. In particular, when visceral cultures were positive, broth culture of wound swabs predicted a major wound infection rate of 0% when sterile, 4.8% when a single pathogenic species was cultured, and 10.1% when two or more were cultured. The corresponding figures for thioglycollate-transported swabs were 1.0%, 10.5%, and 12.9%. We conclude that broth cultures of parietal swabs allow accurate identification of patients at risk of infection from bacterial contamination of the wound during operation.\r"

Surface biofilm disruption by sonication significantly increased the incidence of positive cultures of excised graft material compared with broth (P less than .010) and blood agar plate (P less than .005) culture techniques. The S epidermidis was recovered from 31% of the canine vascular grafts and 100% of the clinical specimens. The in vitro production of a glycocalyx \"slime\" was demonstrated in 73% of the recovered staphylococcal strains.

These mice were then \"monoassociated\" with a streptomycin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli. Forty-eight hours later, E coli was present in all animals at a concentration of 10(11)/g of cecum. In four separate experiments, E coli was recovered from 100% of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of the immunocompetent Swiss Webster mice and from 10%, 40%, 30%, and 50% of the MLNs of macrophage-defective C3H/HeJ mice. Swiss Webster mice were then similarly monoassociated by antibiotic decontamination followed by administration of antibiotic-resistant, fluorescein-labeled E coli in their drinking water; cohort groups of mice were given fluorescein-labeled latex beads (1 micron in diameter) in their drinking water. Two, four, and 11 days later, the MLNs were removed and single cell suspensions were analyzed in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The fluorescein label was detected exclusively in the macrophage (esterase-positive) population. These results support the hypothesis that intestinal macrophages may play a key role in the transport of intestinal particles (including bacteria) into extraintestinal sites.\r"

Our data indicate that cardiac output (by thermodilution) increased, systemic vascular resistance decreased, and a differential arteriolar response occurred, with constriction of large arterioles and dilation of small terminal arterioles. We conclude that dilation of small terminal arterioles in skeletal muscle could contribute to decreased systemic vascular resistance during hyperdynamic sepsis. This may be an appropriate response to increased oxygen demand or decreased tissue utilization of oxygen. Alternatively, small-arteriole dilation may be an inappropriate response and secondary to release of vasoactive inflammatory mediators. If the latter is true, there is a potential therapeutic role for selective manipulation of the tone of small terminal arterioles in hyperdynamic sepsis.\r"

The effectiveness of the implant in altering the refractive power of the cornea depends on the refractive index of the intracorneal lens, since little change in the anterior corneal curvature occurs. Thirteen nonhuman primate eyes received intracorneal lenses made of synthetic polymers with refractive indexes ranging from 1.3686 to 1.633. The lidofilcon-B hydrogel (refractive index, 1.3686) lenses created no significant alteration in the refractive power of the cornea. The polymethylmethacrylate (refractive index, 1.4900D) and polysulfone (refractive index, 1.633) lenses created a predictable and significant alteration of corneal power that increased with each implant with a successively higher refractive index. The polymethylmethacrylate lens created a refractive alteration that was approximately 31% of the lens power in air. The polysulfone lens created a corneal power alteration that was approximately 40% of the lens power in air.\r"

Significant changes in the stromal collagen were documented. Similar changes were found in a previous analysis of never-used, factory-prepared lenticules that had been prepared following the use of a corneal press and a lyophilization process. This study suggests that the presently used process of tissue preparation may be deleterious to the structure of the donor lenticule and may adversely affect surface reepithelialization.

This protein is a major protein constituent of normal articular cartilage. Fragments which are immunologically cross-reactive with the 550,000-dalton protein were more abundant in OA cartilage than in normal articular cartilage.

  ".W": "Cisplatin (cis-platinum, 100 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/d), for 120 hours' infusion every three weeks for three courses, produced a 93% overall response rate and a 54% complete clinical response at the single-institution level. The same combination was tested in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of this combination. An overall response rate of 86% was obtained, with a 38% complete clinical response. Only 27 of 42 patients completed planned surgery. Compliance with chemotherapy and radiation therapy was substantially better. No additional morbidity after surgical resection or postoperative radiation therapy was identified as secondary to the induction chemotherapy. We conclude that the combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil infusion is effective, with high complete clinical response rate in patients with advanced, previously untreated head and neck carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the specific thromboxane receptor blocking drug AH23848 was investigated in two double blind placebo controlled studies in male patients with exercise induced angina pectoris and angiographically verified coronary lesions. In the first study cardiac pacing was performed in twenty patients after coronary angiography. Patients were then randomised into two groups and received either AH23848 (70 mg orally) or placebo. One hour later cardiac pacing was repeated. Neither treatment had any significant effect upon time to angina or the rate-pressure product at the onset of chest pain in these patients. In the second study twenty male patients were randomised to seven days' treatment with AH23848 (70 mg three times a day) or placebo followed by a crossover to the other treatment for a further seven days. Clinical assessment was performed before treatment and at the end of each treatment period. There was no significant difference between the placebo and AH23848 treatment periods in exercise tolerance, the rate-pressure product at angina after exercise testing, the number of ischaemic attacks as determined from 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiograms, the number of attacks of pain, or the number of glyceryl trinitrate tablets consumed. This lack of a clinical effect with AH23848 was seen despite a profound inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation stimulated by the thromboxane A2-mimetic U-46619. Because in experimental animals in vivo AH23848 blocks vascular thromboxane receptors as well as platelet thromboxane receptors the lack of effect of AH23848 in cardiac pacing and exercise induced angina is unlikely to be the result of inadequate blockade of thromboxane receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before treatment all patients were limited by breathlessness on exercise; one was oedematous. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone were normal but plasma noradrenaline was raised both at rest and on exercise. After one month's treatment with frusemide (40 mg) and amiloride (5 mg) weight was significantly reduced by a mean of 3.5 kg and exercise capacity had doubled. Plasma noradrenaline fell to normal at rest but remained abnormally raised on exercise. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone increased significantly both at rest and on exercise. Diuretics bring about a considerable clinical improvement in patients with chronic heart failure but they stimulate the renin-angiotensin system. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system in moderate heart failure occurs as a response to diuretic treatment rather than as a result of the disease process itself.\r"

  ".W": "Body temperature was studied in 65 patients admitted to hospital within four hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Thirty three patients had been randomly assigned to intravenous timolol treatment and 32 to placebo treatment. Infarct evolution was assessed by continuous vectorcardiography and creatine kinase release. Maximum and mean temperatures during the first eight days were significantly lower in the timolol group, who were discharged from hospital one day earlier. Eight patients in the placebo group had temperatures of greater than 39 degrees compared with one in the timolol group. Both the mean temperature and the maximum temperature correlated significantly with indices of infarct size and ischaemic area as estimated by cumulative creatine kinase release, QRS vector difference, and ST vector magnitude. The results were consistent with the view that reduction of infarct size may partly explain the reduced pyrexial response after timolol treatment. Other mechanisms are probably also involved in larger infarcts. Because high fever has detrimental haemodynamic effects in acute myocardial infarction, reduction of this response may be beneficial. The results support the early use of beta adrenoceptor blockade in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and twenty renal transplant recipients were investigated. Fifty-eight (48%) were found to have warts, 13 (11%) keratoses and six (5%) to have, or recently to have had cancers. The longer the time of immunosuppression, the greater the prevalence of warts; of those patients who had had their transplant for at least 5 years, 87% had warts. Those with a graft survival time of 10 years or more are at special risk of warts, keratoses and malignancy. Five (10%) of 50 women had genital warts, four of whom had internal lesions (vaginal, cervical or anal) and one developed a carcinoma of the vulva. These findings indicate the advisability of colposcopy for all female renal transplant recipients, a high risk group. Eighty-eight specimens from 42 patients were examined by DNA restriction enzyme analysis and cross hybridization for the presence and type of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV DNA was detected in 66% of the warts examined, HPV2 and HPV4 occurring most often and HPV1 and HPV3 only infrequently. In sequential specimens from common hand warts of one individual, an HPV was found which could not be precisely identified but was related to HPV4. HPV16 was detected in a vaginal wart from one patient and an HPV6-related virus in a vulval wart of another. HPV DNA of an unknown type was demonstrated in one of 11 keratoses examined. With the probes used to examine the few samples of skin cancers available, HPV16 was found in a squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, and faint bands from an unidentified type of HPV were detected in two squamous cell carcinomata from a patient's hand. One woman had plaque lesions morphologically and histologically resembling those found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). HPV5 was identified in these lesions. This is only the third reported case of HPV5, previously thought to be unique to EV, in a renal transplant recipient.\r"

Various ovarian lesions were found in 35 women, including five mucinous and serous cystadenomas, one carcinoma, two borderline tumours, and a cancer of the caecum. None of the borderline or malignant ovarian lesions were found by manual pelvic examination. Ultrasound screening appears to be a useful diagnostic aid, though its usefulness might be further improved if other risk factors such as heredity and period of ovulatory activity are taken into consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Human marrow transplantation for the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant disorders is becoming an established modality of therapy. As in any aggressive therapeutic modality, the benefits must be balanced with the risks of the therapy. The aggressive chemoradiotherapy used to prepare patients for marrow transplantation creates a transient immunodeficiency disorder postgrafting until the transferred donor marrow reestablishes a competent immune system. Immune reconstitution posttransplant follows a general pattern developing from immature to mature immune functions. Immune reactivity during the first month postgrafting is extremely low. Cytotoxic and phagocytic functions recover by day 100, while more specialized and cooperative functions of T and B cells remain impaired up to one year or more postgrafting. After the first year postgrafting, the various components of the immune systems of most healthy marrow recipients begin to work synchronously, whereas the immune systems of recipients with chronic graft-v-host disease (GVHD) remain crippled. Recent evidence shows that transfer of specific immunity from marrow donors to marrow recipients plays a role in reestablishing immunocompetence. Transferred antigen-specific immunity may explain why more recipients do not die from overwhelming infections.\r"

The number of residual viable T cell infused to the patient was 0.99 +/- 0.65 X 10(6) per kg body weight. The patients were conditioned with fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) (12 Gy) preceding high doses of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). Methotrexate was used as an additional immunosuppressant in the first ten patients. For the following 22 patients no posttransplant immunoprophylaxis was administered. Eight patients died within three months due to complications related to transplantation. Engraftment was achieved in all evaluable patients, and no patient has a late graft failure. The proof of total chimerism was established in 24 patients. Twenty-four of 27 evaluable patients (88%) did not have an acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) greater than grade 0 to 1. Two patients had a grade 2 (skin only), and one patient had a grade 4 acute GVHD (the latter had only 80% of T cell depletion). A medullary relapse occurred in 11 patients (nine of them had previously been defined as \"high risk leukemia\"). Our data suggest that it may not be necessary to deplete nearly all T cells to prevent acute GVHD in recipients of HLA-identical marrow.\r"

  ".W": "The intraerythrocytic development of the malaria parasite is accompanied by distinct morphological and biochemical changes in the host cell membrane, yet little is known about development-related alterations in the transbilayer organization of membrane phospholipids in parasitized cells. This question was examined in human red cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Normal red cells were infected with strain FCR3 or with clonal derivatives that either produce (K+) or do not produce (K-) knobby protuberances on the infected red cells. Parasitized cells were harvested at various stages of parasite development, and the bilayer orientation of red cell membrane phospholipids was determined chemically using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) or enzymatically using bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and sphingomyelinase C (SMC). We found that parasite development was accompanied by distinct alterations in the red cell membrane transbilayer distribution of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS). Increases in the exoplasmic membrane leaflet exposure of PE and PS were larger in the late-stage parasitized cells than in the early-stage parasitized cells. Similar results were obtained for PE membrane distribution using either chemical (TNBS) or enzymatic (PLA2 plus SMC) methods, although changes in PS distribution were observed only with TNBS. Uninfected cohort cells derived from mixed populations of infected and uninfected cells exhibited normal patterns of membrane phospholipid organization. The observed alterations in P falciparum-infected red cell membrane phospholipid distribution, which is independent of the presence or absence of knobby protuberances, might be associated with the drastic changes in cell membrane permeability and susceptibility to early hemolysis observed in the late stages of parasite development.\r"

Hematologic engraftment was prompt with return of greater than or equal to 0.5 X 10(3)/microL granulocytes and greater than or equal to 2 X 10(4)/microL platelets at a median of 26 and 29 days posttransplant, respectively. Immunologic reconstitution, in contrast, was prolonged. Normal numbers of circulating B cells were consistently noted by five months posttransplant, whereas return of normal immunoglobulin levels in some patients did not occur for one year. Normal numbers of T cells were evident within the first month posttransplant, but a reversed T4:T8 ratio persisted in some patients up to three years. In vitro responses of either B cells to triggers of activation or of T cells to mitogens and antigens were not normal for at least three months posttransplant. Natural killer (NK) cells predominated early after transplant and may demonstrate cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Our studies demonstrate that transplantation with anti-B1 purged autologous bone marrow results in complete hematologic and delayed immunologic engraftment. No significant acute or chronic clinical toxicities have been observed.\r"

Polyclonal antisera to alpha glycophorin and to alpha glycophorin CNBr carboxyl terminal fragment C (residues 82-131) and M and N specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were used. The first two reagents detect specific regions of the alpha glycophorin molecule and all electrophoretically resolved species of glycophorins immunologically related to alpha and delta glycophorins (delta glycophorin, [alpha-delta] hybrids and other glycophorins with an alteration in the carboxyl terminal segment); the M and N MoAbs identified the glycophorin species containing or lacking the M or N determinant in the amino terminal octapeptide structures. We find that immunoblotting confirmed in all cases the serologically determined phenotype; we also find that polymorphic forms of the glycophorin system are relatively infrequent; immunoblotting, independent from serologic testing, was capable of detecting five mutants, two most likely S-s-U-phenotypes; a new glycophorin species was detected in normal red cells with both antiglycophorin and antipeptide C sera, which is not evident with MoAbs; immunoblots of known glycophorin variants (En(a-), U-, Mg, Mi I, II, III, V, and Sta) confirmed but also extended our knowledge of the abnormal glycophorins involved; and the He+ and Wrb(-) cells showed normal patterns.\r"

  ".W": "Different molecular species of interleukin 1 (IL 1) were examined for the spectrum of responses elicited in human endothelial cells (HEC), including synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2), tissue-type procoagulant activity (PCA), platelet activating factor (PAF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PA-I). The IL 1 preparations utilized for the present study included a natural, partially purified IL 1, a preparation purified to homogeneity with extensive homology with the derived aminoacid IL 1 beta (pI7) sequence denominated \"22K factor,\" murine recombinant IL 1 alpha, human recombinant IL 1 alpha (pI5) and beta (pI7). Natural, partially purified IL 1, a mixture of alpha and beta species, induced the entire spectrum of responses in HEC. Production of PA-I was elicited by all forms of IL 1 tested. PGI2 and PCA were elicited by \"22K factor\" and by human recombinant IL 1 beta and alpha but not by murine recombinant IL 1 alpha. PAF synthesis was stimulated by murine and human recombinant IL 1 alpha but not by human recombinant IL 1 beta and 22K factor. Thus the available different molecular forms of IL 1 elicit largely but not completely overlapping patterns of responses in HEC. The IL 1 pathway of regulation of HEC functions might provide a basis for novel strategies in therapeutically oriented research on vessel wall disorders.\r"

In this latter group, various conventional methods of investigation had failed to disclose the site of recurrence. However, of a total of 21 sites reported as positive in these 14 patients, eight proved to be false positives. Two false negative results also occurred in this group and nine could not be evaluated. Although occasionally patients were usefully scanned, improvements are necessary before consistently reliable information can be obtained using this technique.\r"

The Doppler ultrasonic flowmeter has enabled us to make a correct and rapid diagnosis of acute scrotum and has reduced the number of negative scrotal explorations. It seemed logical to use the Doppler flowmeter in the diagnosis of torsion of the testis, since testicular blood flow should be diminished in torsion and unaffected in most other intrascrotal conditions. The testes lend themselves to the use of this instrument because they are accessible and because one testis can be used as a control in the qualitative evaluation of the sound of the testicular blood flow.\r"

The magnitude of prevalence is comparable with and, in some areas, even higher than grass pollen allergy. The symptom periods are often prolonged by cross-reactivity among species and sometimes families as well as by simultaneous sensitivity to several trees, pollinating at different times. There is a need for standardized extracts to improve diagnostic precision and treatment efficacy. A substantial amount of immunochemical data on the allergens from Betulaceae species, particularly Betula (birches), are available. Relevant methods to quantitatively and qualitatively measure the allergens of birch pollen extracts are clearly reproducible in laboratories around the world. By international collaboration, such work has generated an IS that has been accepted by the IUIS Subcommittee on Allergen Standardization. The IS is a yardstick for authorities, manufacturers, and researchers that is carefully specified in terms of 1 major and a few intermediate allergens, and also of total biologic activity by RAST inhibition. A meaningful declaration of biologic activity in vivo is awaited. As yet, only a few clinical trials have been undertaken with standardized tree pollen extracts. These are, however, highly interesting, particularly those that now have started with an oral route of administration.\r"

The preoperative serum HCG level of 11 mIU/ml, which temporarily decreased to the normal range after operation, soon increased thereafter. The serum HCG level decreased, however, to the normal range after postoperative mediastinal radiation therapy. During relapse, only the serum HCG level increased gradually to 26,000 mIU/ml 7 weeks before his death. The lung cancer was classified histologically as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, AFP was detected in the mononuclear tumor cells of the primary tumor in the lung, and HCG was found in the giant cells of the subcarinal metastatic lymph node. The concanavalin A non-reactive fraction rate for AFP was 81.3%, and appeared to differ from those of hepatocellular carcinoma and yolk sac tumor.\r"

A 39% (75/191) rate of complete clinical responses was achieved. Thirty-two of the chemotherapy-induced complete responders underwent radical surgery. Thirteen had no histologic evidence of residual disease in the surgically resected specimen. The CDDP and 5-FU infusion combination achieved the highest histologic complete response rate. All histologically complete responders who had completed local radiation therapy are clinically free of disease at median follow-up of 36 months. Patients who achieved complete response both clinically and histologically had superior survival as compared to patients who achieved complete response clinically and were subsequently found to have residual tumor in their surgically resected specimen (P = 0.01). An analysis of the clinical and pathological pretreatment characteristics was performed to identify factors predictive of histologic complete response. Advanced nodal disease correlated inversely with the achievement of negative histology in the surgically resected specimen (P = 0.02). No other factors were significant in predicting response.\r"

A clinicopathologic study was performed in these 14 cases, and the immunohistochemical localization of keratin (KRT), vimentin (VMT), albumin (ALB), fibrinogen (FBG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined using the avidin-biotin complex method. Clinically, the HCCs with sarcomatous appearance were characterized by negative or low serum AFP levels and high incidence of extrahepatic metastasis. Grossly they were of infiltrative, mixed expansive and infiltrative, and pedunculated types. Histologically, the tumor consisted mainly of spindle-shaped cells and partly of multinucleated cells, and showed a sinusoidal growth pattern at the tumor-nontumor boundary. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells in the regions showing sarcomatous appearance were frequently found to be positive to KRT and VMT, whereas the percentage of positivity to ALB, FBG, and AFP were not significantly different from those in ordinary HCC. These results strongly suggest that the lesion showing sarcomatous appearance represents the sarcomatous change of HCC rather than being regarded as the complication of HCC and sarcoma.\r"

Since 1968, two thirds (39/59) of all patients who developed pulmonary metastases have had a total of 66 thoracotomies. Nine patients are alive with no evidence of disease, and six additional patients are alive with disease. Analyzed in 39 evaluable patients, the prognostic factors that correlate with survival by univariate analysis are: sex, number of nodules detected radiographically and resected, completeness of resection, and tumor location (bilateral versus unilateral). By Cox regression analysis, only sex and the number of nodules detected either radiographically or during surgery, and resected, had statistically significant correlation with survival. Thoracotomy is curative for some patients with pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma and Prognostic factors predictive for survival are defined.\r"

The 212 evaluable subjects in this trial received 2 X 10(6) U/m2 of interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously, on an outpatient basis, three times a week for 1 year. Of this group, 166 had previously undergone splenectomy, and 94 had received chemotherapy; 96% had more than 50% hairy cells in the bone marrow. Objective responses (complete, partial, and minor) were recorded in 89% of the study group and were characterized by a marked reduction in infections as well as in the need for transfusions. Complete response, defined as a normal complete blood count (CBC) and less than 5% hairy cells in the marrow, was achieved in 4% of the subjects. Partial responses (normal CBC) were attained in 74%, and minor responses (normalization of subnormal hematocrits or granulocyte or platelet counts) in 11%. Normalization of CBC usually did not occur until after 2 to 5 months of therapy. Results were comparable in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients. After 1 year of treatment, the responders were randomized to continue therapy for 6 months or to stop treatment and remain under observation. Preliminary findings have shown no significant differences in the incidence or time to progression of disease in the two groups, but additional data will be required before conclusions can be reached with regard to the need for maintenance therapy. Overall, the results of this study indicate that interferon alfa-2b is well tolerated, produces durable responses, and dramatically improves the quality of life in a high percentage of patients with progressive HCL.\r"

In Study II, performed in 1983, vinblastine (0.1 mg/kg/week) was added to the same IFN alpha regimen in 22 subjects. Study III, held from 1984 to 1985, evaluated the effects of escalating doses of interferon alfa-2a (from 3 to 36 X 10(6) U/day) administered 5 days per week to 19 patients. Overall, complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) totaled 17% (14%, 14%, and 26% in Studies I-III, respectively). Median survival of all patients was 49 weeks. Median survival appeared to be superior in the third study, likely because of the patient mix (skewed toward a Karnofsky performance status of 10, disease-free interval longer than 1 year, and disease confined to the lung). Those prognostic factors were also found to correlate with improved median survival in the total group of 84 patients. Likewise, response to therapy was linked to prolonged survival; patients with CR, PR, or minimal responses had a median survival of 72 weeks. In all the favorable subgroups, responders had better outcomes than nonresponders, but it was not clear whether response to therapy merely selected out patients with better initial prognoses or actually led to improved survival.\r"

To some extent, the likelihood of tumor recurrence can be predicted, based on certain risk factors. Furthermore, the probability of recurrence can be altered through appropriate clinical interventions. A review of the literature, much of which is preliminary, suggests that interferon therapy for bladder cancer may modify the biologic behavior of this disease and provide clinical benefit for some patients.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical development of the alpha interferons has now progressed through initial Phase I and II trials into extensive controlled clinical trial designs. Alpha interferon has been a prototype of other biological agents that are now in clinical development. These agents operate through fundamentally different mechanisms of action than conventional chemotherapy and have produced a unique profile of side effects as well as response patterns. Time to response is generally longer than with chemotherapy, and dose-response and schedule-dependency questions continue to be explored for most tumor types. Although response rates have been low against most solid tumors when alpha interferon is used as a single agent, it has demonstrated a surprisingly wide range of efficacy in hematologic malignancies. These include tumors of presumed B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid lineages. In some diseases, e.g., hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, alpha interferon is broadly effective; it appears to considerably reduce or occasionally eliminate the malignant clone while normalizing the peripheral blood counts in most patients. In other diseases, alpha interferon appears destined to play a major role as part of combination therapy or in maintenance or consolidation therapy. In other disease settings, alpha interferon's role continues to be explored as part of combination therapy, adjuvant therapy, or as local-regional therapy. The full potential of alpha interferon as an antineoplastic agent will not be determined for many years. In this paper, the results from the first 5 years of widespread clinical testing are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of monoclonal antibodies including antibodies against neuroectodermal antigens, (UJ13A, UJ127.11, UJ181.4), leukocytes (2D1), intermediate filament antigens cytokeratin (LE61), Vimentin, Desmin (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland), myoglobin, and neurofilament (155) antigens were assessed for their use as an adjunct to light microscopy in pediatric pathology, with particular emphasis on the \"small round cell\" tumors. One hundred thirty-four tumors were studied using immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques. The differentiation of neuroblastoma from lymphoma proved to have a clear-cut immunologic profile, as did the rhabdomyosarcomas, which showed consistent positivity with neuroectodermal antibody UJ13A and in positive binding with antidesmin. Ewing's sarcoma did not give a clear immunohistologic pattern with these antibodies. This panel was shown to have been a valuable aid to diagnosis in 12% of cases studied. The future use of such a panel for routine diagnostic use is discussed, but it is emphasized that the binding pattern of these tumors is often heterogeneous, and examination in conjunction with conventional histology is essential if the correct conclusions are to be made.\r"

  ".W": "Nine acinar cell carcinomas of the pancreas, 2 pancreatoblastomas, 16 solid-cystic (papillary-cystic) tumors, and 20 ductal adenocarcinomas were immunocytochemically investigated using antisera against four pancreatic enzymes (alpha-amylase, lipase, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen), four pancreatic hormones, neuron specific enolase (NSE), alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA 19-9. Lipase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen, but no alpha-amylase were detected in all acinar cell carcinomas and pancreatoblastomas. In contrast, solid-cystic tumors (SCT) were negative for pancreatic enzymes but 2 of 16 stained with NSE. No neuroendocrine granules or pancreatic hormones could be demonstrated. AAT was found in all tumors except ductal adenocarcinomas, which stained with CEA and CA 19-9. The study established pancreatic enzymes (except alpha-amylase) as immunocytochemical markers for acinar cell carcinomas and pancreatoblastomas. There is as yet no marker specific for SCT, which would elucidate the obscure histogenetic origin and phenotypic differentiation of these tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Fever during neutropenia before engraftment was studied in 86 consecutively treated patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Eighty-four of the 86 patients experienced 132 febrile episodes. Only 26% of the patients had one fever which resolved with antibiotics. The rest required modification of antimicrobial therapy because of refractory fever (32%) or recurrent fevers (42%). The 121 fevers which occurred during neutropenia were analyzed to determine differences between first and subsequent fevers (79 and 42 episodes, respectively). The frequency of sepsis (23%) and defervescence (64%) did not differ between first and subsequent fevers. Presumed localized infection (PLI) was identified in 75% of first fever but in only 28% of subsequent fevers (P = 0.000002). Of the PLI identified, oropharyngeal mucosal disease accounted for 68% during first fever but only 38% during subsequent fevers (P = 0.02). Although sepsis in first fever was more frequently associated with PLI than sepsis in subsequent fevers (61% versus 10%, P = 0.01), overall, patients with PLI had a lower frequency of sepsis than those without (17% versus 32%, P = 0.04). Gram-negative pathogens were uniformly gentamicin sensitive in sepsis during first fever but were mostly gentamicin-resistant in sepsis during subsequent fevers (P = 0.01).\r"
