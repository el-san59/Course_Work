The authors conclude that the phenomenology of multiple personality disorder is frequently more complex than is suspected early in the course of treatment.\r"

This pattern of disruption mimics that seen in patients with organic amnesias and is in sharp contrast to the pattern seen in patients with dementia.

Medical examiners were more likely to use these generalized cardiovascular terms as were physicians who went to certain medical schools in the state. The physician's terminology preference was associated with the sex and race of the decedent and was related to aspects of the patient's medical care. The ICD should be modified in the 10th revision to allow for the separate classification of generalized cardiovascular terminology within the ischemic heart disease category.\r"

Applying a Poisson statistical model to pre- and post-law belt usage rates together with counts of fatalities and injuries in 12 metropolitan areas, we estimate the first six months' application of the law averted 220 fatal, 1,500 severe, 4,600 moderate, and 2,600 light injuries across the state. The Poisson approach gives estimates of injuries averted considerably greater than simple year to year comparisons, indicating that media announcements have understated the efficacy of requiring safety belt usage.\r"

Before meeting, nine nationally influential physicians rated 675 indications; after review and discussion, they rated 864. The method did not force unanimity; our purposes were not only to encourage agreement but also to uncover areas of disagreement concerning the procedure's appropriate use. The panelists agreed on the level of appropriateness for 54 per cent of the final 864 indications and disagreed on 18 per cent. Ratings were reliably reproduced six to eight months after the completion of the process. The physicians' indications and ratings were consistent with those in the literature, and statistical analysis demonstrated that they followed logical clinical rationale. We conclude that consensus methods that do not force agreement can be used with panels of physicians to produce detailed, reliable, and valid indications. They can also identify medically controversial reasons for using a procedure that can serve as a starting point for a research agenda.\r"

The autograft was assessed grossly, histologically, and biochemically with respect to time. Histologic observations demonstrated that autografts were centrally acellular with a peripheral rim of cells at 2 weeks, and had a central focal proliferation of cells at 3 weeks and cellular homogeneity by 4 weeks postoperation. Necrosis followed by cellular proliferation suggested that a population of cells other than the native PT fibroblasts may be inhabiting the graft. Graft sequestration experiments demonstrated that autografts are repopulated by cells of extrinsic origin after transplantation. Autografts showed a gradual assumption of the microscopic properties of normal ACL; by 30 weeks posttransplant the tissue characteristics were ligamentous in appearance. Histologic changes paralleled the biochemical metamorphosis: Type III collagen was not observed in PT; however, a gradual increase in its concentration was seen in the grafts; by 30 weeks its concentration (10%) was the same as in normal ACL. Similarly, glycosaminoglycan content increased from its normally low level in PT to that found in native ACL. Collagen-reducible cross-link analysis revealed that grafted tissue changed from the normal PT pattern of low dihydroxylysinonorleucine and high histidinohydroxymerodesmosine to the opposite pattern seen in normal ACL by 30 weeks. These data suggest that PT autografts undergo a process of \"ligamentization\" when placed in the ACL environment, and that cells responsible for this metamorphosis are of extragraft origin.\r"

This mechanism may result in posterior block or impingement of an os trigonum or Stieda's process. When the dancer attempts to force the foot into plantar flexion, the os trigonum or the Stieda's process may be impinged between the calcaneus and the posterior edge of the tibia. Pain and tenderness are localized at the posterolateral aspect of the ankle behind the peroneal tendons. In nondancing members of the population, these conditions are usually asymptomatic. It is the requirement of the classical dance for a well-pointed foot that produces symptoms. We are reporting up to 7 years' followup of six professional ballet dancers in whom we removed the os trigonum for symptomatic talar compression syndrome, caused by the trauma of the en pointe position of toe dancing. Two patients had bilateral operations. All six patients returned to professional dancing within a few months and remained asymptomatic. The anatomy of this condition is reviewed, as well as the diagnosis and treatment.\r"

The electromyographic data demonstrated that all muscle groups except the hip flexor and adductor longus were active during foot descent, floor contact, and midsupport. There was absence of muscle function during the late toe-off phase except that demonstrated by the adductor longus and the abdominal muscles during sprinting. The main muscle group that appears to increase the speed of gait is that of the hip flexors, which is closely linked to the knee extensors in order to propel the body forward in the line of progression. There was little or no activity in the gastrocnemius or in the intrinsic muscles of the foot about the time of toe-off, leading the authors to conclude that push-off per se does not appear to occur.\r"

All fractures occurred while playing baseball; four while swinging a bat, and two secondary to a fall on an outstretched hand. Roentgenographic diagnosis was made by carpal tunnel view alone in two, oblique and carpal tunnel view in one, bone scan and subsequent carpal tunnel view in two, and computerized tomography in one fracture. Five of the fractures were through the base of the hook, while one was toward the tip. All patients ultimately underwent hook resection, four early and two late. The patient who sustained the tip of the hook fracture underwent resection of the fracture only to refracture the same hook at its base 6 months later. All patients returned to their previous level of activity in 6 to 8 weeks after surgery without loss of function. Hence, it is the authors' opinion that the entire hook should be resected to the base of the hamate as the primary form of treatment in hook of the hamate fractures.\r"

In the absence of controlled studies and considering the reported poor results with high rates of pelvic sepsis when this operation is performed without a proximal defunctionalizing ileostomy, we will continue to routinely use proximal ileostomy in all patients undergoing this procedure. There is a high rate of complications related to loop ileostomy; however, they are not life threatening and do not preclude an excellent long-term result. Dehydration requiring readmission to the hospital occurred in 20 percent of the patients in this series. More sensitive clinical data, such as measurement of urinary electrolyte levels, should be used to identify patients at high risk for this complication. Septic complications were rare after closure of the loop ileostomy, but bowel obstruction was common. Bowel obstruction rarely required operative intervention, but it is possible that changing the method of closure may decrease the rate of obstruction. The use of loop ileostomy to bypass temporarily part of the terminal ileum may have significant metabolic effects that require further study.\r"

  ".W": "In a pericardial tamponade model of cardiogenic shock in pigs, we had previously shown that acute reductions in cardiac output produce severe mesenteric ischemia due to disproportionate splanchnic vasoconstriction. In this study, we extended the period of cardiogenic shock in order to investigate the pathogenesis of ischemic injury to the small intestinal wall. Four hours of tamponade produced sustained changes in splanchnic hemodynamics, similar to those observed in the prior short-term experiments. The resultant mesenteric ischemia caused necrotic lesions of the small intestine which were characteristic of those seen in nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in human subjects. Prior alpha-adrenergic blockade failed to prevent either sustained mesenteric vasospasm or ischemic injury. In contrast, prior blockade of the renin-angiotensin axis, whether by nephrectomy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, blocked the splanchnic vasoconstriction, and thereby protected the small intestine from ischemic injury. The primary hemodynamic and pathologic features of this model of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia appear to be mediated by the renin-angiotensin axis.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen high-risk critically ill patients with suspected cholecystitis underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy between 1981 and 1986 using Hawkins' needle guide system for gallbladder intubation. Acute cholecystitis was documented in 15 patients, including 1 with common bile duct obstruction. Two other patients had common bile duct obstruction secondary to metastatic cancer (one patient) and chronic pancreatic fibrosis (one patient). There was rapid resolution of the signs and symptoms of cholecystitis, sepsis, or both in 16 of the 17 patients. One critically ill patient with positive findings on blood culture and an organism resistant to triple antibiotic therapy died soon after percutaneous cholecystostomy. In the entire group of 17 patients, there was no evidence of bile leaks or other catheter complications. Six patients subsequently underwent successful cholecystectomy and two underwent common bile duct exploration without complications. One patient underwent cholecystojejunostomy, and in three patients, the catheter was removed with no sequelae of cholecystitis. Two remaining patients had the catheter in place and were awaiting operation at last follow-up. Three of four patients who died within 30 days of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic cholecystostomy died either from the terminal malignant condition (two patients) or from arrhythmia (one patient with cirrhosis). This review suggests that percutaneous cholecystostomy is a safe and effective procedure for resolving acute cholecystitis in high-risk patients. In addition, the technique of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic cholecystostomy appears well suited for percutaneous dissolution of stones, sclerosis of the gallbladder, or both in selected high-risk critically ill patients.\r"

When stones were present, they were in the form of numerous black amorphous rods about 0.1 to 0.4 mm in length. Infrared analysis of the dried stones indicated the following composition: calcium phosphate 26.7 percent, calcium bilirubinate 12.8 percent, cholesterol 15.1 percent, and protein 45.4 percent. Pigment stones were associated with an elevated biliary total calcium level (probably induced by the dietary cholesterol) and a paradoxic decrease in the biliary total bilirubin level. The lithogenic diet produced marked elevations in liver and plasma cholesterol levels and cholesterol saturation of bile, but no cholesterol crystals or stones were observed. The accumulation of elevated levels of cholesterol in the livers of the experimental animals produced mild to moderate hepatotoxicity. The precise mechanism of the dietary induction of pigment stones in this hamster model remains to be elucidated.\r"

To further evaluate the efficacy of this method, we reviewed 85 surgical specimens of the colon and rectum using a high iron diamine-alcian blue staining technique. The group studied included 73 patients with synchronous or metachronous carcinomas and adenomas and 12 patients with no recurrence for more than 5 years who had undergone adequate follow-up, including physical examination; evaluation of serum chemistry findings; and colonoscopy, barium enema, or both. Evaluation of Dukes' staging (A and B1 versus B2 and C2) and distance of the resection margins from the tumor (less than 5 cm versus 5 cm or more) showed no correlation with the amount of sialomucin present. Resection margins from patients with either synchronous or metachronous carcinomas had significantly higher sialomucin ratios than the group without recurrence, whereas those with synchronous or metachronous adenomas did not. The false-negative rate was 4 percent (1 of 23 specimens) and the false-positive rate, 42 percent (5 of 12 specimens). We conclude that this method for evaluating resection margins of colorectal cancer specimens with differential mucin staining is highly reliable for predicting the population with synchronous and metachronous colorectal carcinomas.\r"

A larger proportion of unselected patients can undergo resection, which now carries an acceptably low mortality rate. Serious complications arising directly from technical failure are minimal but a reduction in the incidence of the most common cause of death, pulmonary infection, and ultimately respiratory failure is not imminent and will require a concerted effort of investigation and modification of treatment strategy to achieve this. Pathologic studies indicate that a subtotal esophagectomy is desirable for all squamous cancers and, if possible, a resection margin of 10 cm should be obtained. The esophagogastric anastomosis made by a circular stapler is a very safe one, although it is associated with a high incidence of anastomotic stricture. Survival rates of resected patients are encouraging. Half of these patients had potentially curative resections and the 3.5 year survival rate was 41.3 percent, whereas for those resected for palliation, it was 7.3 percent. Almost all patients had their ability to swallow restored, which was the primary objective of operation.\r"

Glucan treatment also resulted in decreased plasma and peritoneal trypsin activity, as well as increased trypsin-binding activity in the blood and peritoneal cavity. Plasma interleukin-1, as well as macrophage production of interleukin-1, were increased in the glucan-treated mice, which indicated enhanced macrophage function. These composite findings suggest that by enhancing diverse aspects of reticuloendothelial function, clinical use of immunomodulators may have significant impact on the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.\r"

Eighty percent of the adenocarcinomas were Dukes' A or B, 15 percent were Dukes' C, and 5 percent presented with distant metastases. Clinical impression on examination was more accurate than biopsy in assessing the presence of malignancy in these tumors. Recurrence after local treatment of both benign and malignant tumors was high. Recurrence was significantly related to the size of the adenoma (more common when the tumor was more than 4 cm in diameter), location (more common when it was located in the rectum), and the type of treatment. Only 4 percent of the patients had died from colorectal cancer at the time of follow-up. The overall 5 year actuarial survival rate was 85 percent.\r"

Pretreatment of the test segments significantly prevented aspirin-induced disruption of the mucosal barrier as evidenced by an increase in potential difference and a decrease in acid back-diffusion and sodium ion and potassium ion flux. These findings were associated with a marked reduction in the degree of mucosal injury. Our results support the recent hypothesis that surface-active phospholipid plays an important role in gastric mucosal defense against the damaging effects to luminal acid.\r"

We have demonstrated primary, early depression of lung phospholipid synthesis reflected in both lung tissue and alveolar washings. We suggest that this quantitative change in pulmonary surfactant synthetic rate may partly explain the occurrence of respiratory failure with acute pancreatitis.\r"

The majority of patients (80 percent) were found to have pancreas divisum as an incidental finding or in association with alcoholic pancreatitis. Of 82 patients with idiopathic pancreatitis, only 2 had pancreas divisum. The three patients with pancreas divisum who had sphincteroplasty of the minor papilla were not helped by the procedure.

Unfortunately, a serum marker for monitoring small intestine transplantation rejection has not been identified. Hexosaminidase, a lysosomal acid hydrolase, has been shown to increase in serum in association with intestinal ischemia, a finding also associated with acute rejection after small intestine transplantation. We measured N-acetyl hexosaminidase levels after transplantation in three groups of five rats each as follows: Group I, Lewis strain small intestine to Lewis recipients; Group II, Wistar small intestine to Lewis recipients; and Group III, Wistar small intestine to Lewis recipients treated with 25 mg/kg per day of cyclosporine. Serum N-acetyl hexosaminidase levels and mucosal biopsies were obtained on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 21. Rats in Groups I and III survived without gross evidence of rejection. Three rats in Group II died between 8 and 10 days, and serum N-acetyl hexosaminidase levels increased 24 to 48 hours before death. In the remaining Group II rats, the N-acetyl hexosaminidase levels were significantly higher on days 10, 12, and 14 after transplantation (p less than 0.05). In two of five rats, the histologic changes of rejection occurred later than the increase in N-acetyl hexosaminidase levels. Because measurement of N-acetyl hexosaminidase levels is a rapid and simple serum assay, it may be useful for monitoring rejection after small intestine transplantation.\r"

Diverticulitis was the most common cause of colovesical fistula, accounting for 71 percent of patients in our series. The majority of patients present electively, and most have urinary tract complaints. In those patients in our study who presented with systemic infection, urinary obstruction was present in 70 percent. Although proctosigmoidoscopy and barium enema examination are essential in the preoperative assessment, cystoscopy is the most useful test in suggesting or confirming the diagnosis of colovesical fistula. Intravenous urography is not necessary in the evaluation of these patients. The surgical treatment depends on the cause of the fistula. For patients with an inflammatory cause of the fistula, one-stage operative treatment is associated with low morbidity and decreased length of stay compared with operative treatment in more than one stage. In the presence of severe inflammation or inadequate bowel preparation, two-stage operative treatment is safe and effective. Operations in three stages for colovesical fistula are not indicated. The primary objectives in the management of colovesical fistulas due to unresectable malignancy are relief of intestinal and urinary obstruction and fecal diversion. Resection of the malignancy should be performed whenever possible.\r"

We reviewed 33 cases of unilateral hepatic duct obstruction from a total of 500 patients with biliary reconstruction treated between 1965 and 1984. The median age of the patients reviewed was 56 years. The most common cause of unilateral hepatic duct obstruction was operative injury (73 percent of patients). Including operations for unilateral obstruction, patients in the series underwent 131 operations related to biliary tract problems. The most common presentation (73 percent of patients) was fever and pain. Obstruction was more common in the right duct than in the left duct by a ratio of 2:1 (22 patients versus 11 patients). The three types of surgical procedures used were hepaticojejunostomy (17 patients), dilatation and drainage (13 patients), and primary hepatic resection (3 patients). Atrophic hepatic lobes resulting in rotational deformity of the portal structures were resected in six patients with combined hepatic duct and arterial injury. No operative deaths occurred, although 51.5 percent of the patients had postoperative complications. Follow-up studies ranging from 1 to 16 years demonstrated that patients who had hepaticojejunostomy required less frequent reoperation compared with those who had dilatation (36 percent versus 64 percent) and had a lower postoperative mortality rate related to biliary tract problems (7 percent versus 18 percent). We conclude that unilateral hepatic duct obstruction continues to occur most commonly because of operative injury and is best treated by hepaticojejunostomy or by resection of chronically obstructed lobes when possible.\r"

  ".W": "Although an absolute correlation has been impossible to demonstrate, it has long been thought that the manometric magnitude of the lower esophageal sphincter pressure was a good index of lower esophageal sphincter strength, and hence its competence. To study this relationship, 12 adult mongrel cats were surgically fitted with gastric cannulas. The cats were studied by six-lumen, radially-oriented, rapid pullback manometry before and after administration of atropine, and before and after daily perfusion of the distal esophagus with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Lower esophageal sphincter strength was determined by the lower esophageal sphincter pressure vector cross-sectional area. This was computed by plotting the lower esophageal sphincter pressure on polar coordinates, and finding the area circumscribed by the vectors. Lower esophageal sphincter competence was determined by measurement of both the intragastric volume and intragastric pressure required to produce gross reflux. Atropine significantly decreased the mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure vector cross-sectional area from 7,963 +/- 2,469 mm Hg to 720 +/- 59 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and decreased the mean lower esophageal sphincter opening pressure from 30.2 +/- 6.9 mm Hg to 13.2 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). However, acid perfusion significantly decreased the lower esophageal sphincter pressure vector cross-sectional area from 6,786 +/- 3,334 mm Hg to 715 +/- 720 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). This indicates that the lower esophageal sphincter has two components, one of which is acid-sensitive and both of which are atropine-sensitive.\r"

The primary component of bombesin-stimulated pancreatic secretion at the lowest tested dose was due to cholecystokinin, with only 25 percent of bombesin-stimulated protein output preserved during proglumide infusion. Maximal stimulation of cholecystokinin release was achieved by even the lowest dose of bombesin, whereas dose-related increases in bombesin-stimulated protein secretion were observed. This increase in exocrine secretion is probably explained by increased direct bombesin stimulation. Our findings suggest that the maximal dose of bombesin is lower for cholecystokinin release than its effective dose for enzyme secretion. We conclude that, in all probability, postprandial release of bombesin (or its analogue, gastrin-releasing peptide) affects pancreatic function primarily through release of cholecystokinin.\r"

  ".W": "To define the effect of anesthetic duration on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled anesthetics, we determined the pharmacokinetics of isoflurane, enflurane, halothane, and methoxyflurane given simultaneously to seven healthy subjects for exactly 30 min and compared the results with data from a previous study in which these four anesthetics were administered for 120 min. End-tidal and mixed-expired anesthetic concentrations were measured during washin of anesthetic and for 3-9 days of washout. Multiexponential (multicompartment) models were fit by least squares to the alveolar washin and washout curves. We estimated the percentage of anesthetic that was metabolized from total uptake and recovery of anesthetic. Alveolar washout was more rapid after the shorter period of anesthetic administration. However, duration of administration did not affect the time constants determined, the number of compartments identified (i.e., five compartments were identified in both studies), or the percentages of anesthetic metabolized.\r"

The developed tension in diabetic papillary muscles electrically paced at a constant rate was not different from that in control muscles, but both the time to peak tension and the relaxation time of the isometric contraction were significantly prolonged in diabetic muscles. Halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane all produced negative inotropic effects in both diabetic and control muscles. However, the negative inotropic effects were significantly less in the muscles from diabetic rats than in the muscles from control rats throughout the range of concentrations. In muscles from both the diabetic and control rats, the negative inotropic effects of these anesthetics were accompanied by decreases in the time to peak tension and in relaxation time. The results suggest that the myocardium from the diabetic rat is less sensitive to the negative inotropic action of volatile anesthetics than is the myocardium of normal hearts.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that the negative inotropic effect of isoflurane is primarily due to a competitive inhibition of the influx of extracellular Ca2+ with little effect on the availability of Ca2+ stored intracellularly in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was examined in rabbit papillary muscle. The negative inotropic effect of isoflurane (1.4%) on steady state contractions (primarily dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+) was significantly greater than that on potentiated-state contractions (primarily dependent on Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum). In previous work from this laboratory we found that halothane has an opposite effect in this regard. Increasing stimulation frequency in the presence of isoproterenol (0.1, 1 microM) completely reversed the negative inotropic effect of isoflurane (1.4%) but not that of halothane (0.6%). These results suggest that isoflurane inhibits Ca2+ influx with little effect on the availability of activator Ca2+ stored in and released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and that the effect of isoflurane but not that of halothane can be effectively counteracted by conditions that are known to increase Ca2+ influx in the absence of an anesthetic. These properties of isoflurane may in part account for the minimal myocardial depressant effect of the anesthetic on the intact heart in the presence of a functional autonomic system.\r"

A decrease of the cortical amplitude and an increase in latency were seen, most pronounced at the L-1 level, but with only minor effect on the S-1 dermatome. No correlation was found between segmental level of analgesia and decrease in amplitude of the evoked potentials. Thus despite clinically adequate surgical anesthesia, the neural pathways as assessed by SEP were incompletely blocked except at the L1 dermatome near the epidural injection site.\r"

This effect was completely offset by simultaneous use of N2O (from 13.9 +/- 2.6 to 4.8 +/- 0.7 min). Thiopental without N2O also increased survival time during complete anoxia (from 26 +/- 1 to 59 +/- 1 sec). This effect was diminished by 58% when N2O was added (from 59 +/- 1 to 40 +/- 1 sec).

Simultaneous measurements were made of abdominal sensory block (analgesia to Allis forceps pinch expressed in dermatomes) and lower limb motor blockade (Bromage scale). Motor block at a given dermatome level was defined as reduction of the integrated EMG amplitude to less than 20% of control. Mean maximum level of sensory block was T-4.2 +/- 0.6 (SEM) mean maximum level of motor block was T-8.8 +/- 0.5. The mean motor sensory differential varied between 4.5 +/- 0.6 and 5.3 +/- 0.9 segments over the 4-hr study period.

  ".W": "The effect of isoflurane on median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (MN-SSEPs) was studied in 15 patients. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal and maintained with oxygen and isoflurane. MN-SSEPs were recorded in awake patients and after achieving 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% stable end-tidal concentrations of isoflurane. Peak latencies and amplitudes of EP, N13, and N20 and conduction times EP-N13, N13-N20, and EP-N20 were measured. Peak latencies of all components increased after all concentrations of isoflurane compared with control values. N20 peak latencies after 1% and 1.5% isoflurane differed significantly, whereas EP and N13 latencies showed no significant difference. No significant change in conduction time EP-N13 resulted from 1% and 1.5% concentrations of isoflurane compared with control values. Isoflurane increased conduction time N13-N20 significantly when compared with control values, and this increase was dose related. Amplitude of EP and N13 did not show significant change with 1% and 1.5% isoflurane when compared with control values. Amplitude of N20 decreased significantly following isoflurane anesthesia compared with control values, and the difference between 1% and 1.5% isoflurane recordings was also statistically significant. N20 was not discernible in one out of 14 patients after 1.5% and in three out of ten patients after 2% isoflurane. These results indicate that subcortical potentials are less affected by isoflurane anesthesia than cortical potentials. Amplitude reduction of cortical potentials was more noticeable than either prolongation of peak latency or conduction time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors investigated the possibility that propranolol reduces the clearance of bupivacaine as well. Bupivacaine, 30-50 mg, was administered intravenously to six normal human volunteers, over 10-15 min on two occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. Propranolol, 40 mg orally every 6 h, was used on one occasion, beginning 24 h prior to the bupivacaine administration. The sequence of the sessions was randomized. Twenty-two venous blood samples were obtained over 36 h in order to determine bupivacaine clearance, terminal elimination rate constant, and volume of distribution. All subjects experienced mild CNS toxicity, consisting of tinnitus, facial tingling, or subtle visual disturbances, associated with peak venous plasma concentrations of 0.81 to 2.7 micrograms/ml. Mean bupivacaine clearance was 0.33 +/- 0.12 l/min for the control session and 0.21 +/- 0.12 l/min during propranolol use, a significant 35% reduction (P less than 0.01). The terminal elimination rate constant (beta) was 0.27 +/- 0.16 h-1 for the control session and 0.14 +/- 0.069 h-1 with propranolol (P less than 0.05); terminal elimination half-lives were 2.6 and 4.9 h, respectively. Volume of distribution was unchanged. Because bupivacaine clearance should be relatively insensitive to hepatic perfusion, it appeared that propranolol caused a substantial inhibition of bupivacaine metabolism at the level of the hepatocyte. These data suggest that concomitant use of propranolol could result in the accumulation of a toxic concentration of bupivacaine.\r"

Fifteen pigtail monkeys weighing 3.3 +/- 0.2 kg (mean +/- SE) were subjected to 17 min complete cerebral ischemia followed by 24 h intensive care treatment and neurologic assessment for an additional 72 h. Monkeys were given 50 ml iv infusions of either dextrose 5% in 0.45% saline solution (n = 8) or lactated Ringer's solution (n = 7) during the preparatory period. This volume corresponds to approximately 1 1/70 kg individual. These same monkeys were placed in either the lateral (n = 3), prone (n = 5), or supine (n = 7) position during the ischemic period. Two monkeys failed to meet preestablished protocol criteria and were excluded from data analysis. Blood glucose immediately preischemia in the dextrose-treated group (181 +/- 19 mg X dl-1) was not significantly greater than in the group given lactated Ringer's solution (140 +/- 6 mg X dl-1; P = 0.07). Dextrose infusion resulted in significantly greater cerebral injury at 96 h postischemia when comparing both neurologic (P less than 0.05) and histopathology (P less than 0.05) scores. Specifically, dextrose administration resulted in the greatest injury to the insular cortex, thalamus, Purkinje cells, and substantia nigra. Although blood glucose was less than 250 mg X dl-1 in all monkeys at the time of complete cerebral ischemia, there was a high correlation between blood glucose rank and neurologic function rank (rs = 0.76; P less than 0.005). The authors were unable to note any effect of head position on the distribution of histopathologic lesions. Prior to removing the brain for histopathologic studies, four monkeys were given repeat infusions of 50 ml dextrose 5% in 0.45% saline solution over 11 +/- 1 min. These infusions produced increases in blood glucose from 56.7 +/- 7.6 to 244 +/- 24.9 mg X dl-1 (P less than 0.01) and increases in brain glucose from 1.64 +/- 0.22 to 5.11 +/- 0.48 mumol X g-1 (P less than 0.01).\r"

Hypoxia-induced increases in PVRI were inhibited by dobutamine, partially at 5 and 10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1, and completely at 20 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1. In two additional groups of seven dogs the effects of reducing FIO2 from 0.4 to 0.1 without and with dopamine or dobutamine either at 10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 (n = 7) or at 20 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 (n = 7) were studied at an unchanged CI obtained by stepwise inflations of a balloon placed in the inferior vena cava. At constant flow both amines increased PVRI at FIO2 0.4 and did not significantly affect hypoxia-induced increases in PVRI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of etomidate on human neutrophil chemiluminescence was evaluated. The latter is an index of oxygen free-radical generation, which is an important bactericidal mechanism. Five drug concentrations representing the free plasma concentrations ranging from deep anesthesia (0.5 microgram/ml) to the plasma level that may be found approximately 1 h after an etomidate anesthetic (0.0156 microgram/ml) were studied. The importance of the duration of drug incubation was assessed by incubating the neutrophils with the drug concentrations for 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 min before stimulation. The reversibility of any depression in chemiluminescence was assessed by gently washing the cells twice after incubation and then stimulating them. The two higher etomidate concentrations (0.5 microgram/ml and 0.125 microgram/ml) produced reductions in chemiluminescence of 43% and 35%, respectively (P less than 0.05). The reductions in activity only occurred when the cells had been incubated with etomidate for 50 min and were completely reversed by washing. These results show that clinically relevant concentrations of etomidate will reversibly depress neutrophil chemiluminescence in vitro when the cells are exposed to the drug for more than 50 min.\r"

  ".W": "Transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography (TEE) was evaluated in 11 patients who underwent myocardial revascularization. The TEE transducer was positioned to view the left ventricular (LV) short-axis at the level of the papillary muscles (midcavity). Good quality echocardiographic images were obtainable in ten of 11 patients. Global LV function was assessed by measuring LV end-diastolic and end-systolic area and computing the fractional area change (FAC). Measurements of LV areas and FAC had excellent intraobserver reproducibility. Regional LV function was analyzed in two ways after dividing the short-axis view of the LV into four or five anatomic segments. Systolic wall thickening (SWT) of the myocardium was measured in each of four segments by digitization of the endocardial and epicardial borders of the LV and determining the fractional wall thickening. Measurements of SWT were not reproducible, primarily because of a difficulty in delineating the epicardial border of the LV accurately. In the second method, regional wall motion (RWM) in each of five segments was graded according to a previously developed scoring system. RWM analysis proved to be a measurement with excellent interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility. TEE was performed without complication and found to be a reproducible method for assessing global and regional LV function. Quantitative analysis is tedious and, therefore, currently not available on-line in the operating room.\r"

The other method used a disposable 1-mL plastic syringe with a disposable 20 G needle. The tests were arranged in five rows. Each row consisted of two pairs of tests on each side of the spine. Each pair was considered as duplicate tests at the same site. The two methods were tested on either side of the back. No difference in precision between the techniques was found. The analysis revealed differences in skin reactivity between different areas of the back of individual patients but without a common pattern between patients. These differences, therefore, will not influence test results if several patients are included in the investigation, eg, of the relative potency of allergenic extracts and the allocation of test sites is consistent. The variation found, however, will influence comparisons within the same patient, but in an unpredictable way.\r"

The administration of the salbutamol plus ipratropium combination did not significantly improve pulmonary function values as compared to salbutamol alone.

The diets were standardized and included high fat, low fat, and a fasting condition. Spirometric determinations and vital signs were obtained at 0, 15, 30 minutes, and at one, two, four, six, eight hours post-dose to evaluate therapeutic availability since no technique for measuring serum levels of procaterol hydrochloride is currently available. Spirometry results indicated significant improvement in pulmonary function during all diet conditions except with the placebo treatment. A delay in onset of action was seen in the low fat diet and to a certain extent in the high fat diet as compared to the fasting condition. There was no effect of diet on procaterol hydrochloride's peak response or duration of action with improvement in pulmonary function demonstrated for up to eight hours. Tremor and headache were the most frequent side effects, and were mild and transient. No significant effects were noted in electrocardiograms, heart rate, or blood pressure. An elevation in serum glucose was seen in three subjects during the fasting challenge and was felt to be secondary to the beta-agonist effects of procaterol hydrochloride. Procaterol was found to be an effective drug with a delayed onset of action when administered with food, but no effect on subsequent efficacy or duration of action.\r"

The extracts were collected and delivered by the International Union of Immunological Societies, Allergen Standardization Subcommittee. One of the extracts, designated M, was proposed as an international standard (IS)-candidate of birch pollen extracts. The protein content of the IS candidate M was found to be 1.12 mg/mL, more than 2-fold higher than any of the other extracts analyzed. This preparation was among the extracts containing the highest number of protein components, as shown by isoelectric focusing, 28 lines, and by 11 precipitates in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The allergenic reactivities were tested by crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) and by radioallergosorbent test (RAST)-inhibition. In CRIE, the proposed IS (M) showed similar affinity for binding patients' IgE as the other extracts, as judged by the autoradiographic illustrations. Except for extract L, the values of RAST-inhibition for the rest were very similar. An IS extract should qualify for the criteria suggested for an optimal allergen preparation, containing minimal amounts of non-allergenic antigens and providing quantitatively and qualitatively all the allergenic proteins. The appropriateness of this selection seems unjustified in view of the above criteria.\r"

Acetylcholine and isoproterenol dose response curves for arterial pressures and heart rate were established following IV boluses of each drug. Once the dose response curves were established, atropine and propranolol were administered endotracheally and intravenously in different groups to alter the established dose response curves. The time required for endotracheally and intravenously administered atropine and propranolol to inhibit 50% of the mean arterial pressure response following an IV infusion of acetylcholine and isoproterenol, respectively, was determined. Atropine and propranolol administered by either route significantly altered the arterial pressure response to acetylcholine and isoproterenol (P less than .05), respectively. Atropine altered the heart rate response to acetylcholine when administered by either route (P less than .05). IV-administered propranolol altered the heart rate response to isoproterenol (P less than .05); endotracheally administered propranolol did not. Atropine administered IV inhibited 50% of the mean arterial pressure response during an acetylcholine infusion within 21 seconds, and within 48 seconds following endotracheal administration. Propranolol administered intravenously inhibited 50% of the mean arterial pressure response during an isoproterenol infusion within 23 seconds, and within 49 seconds following endotracheal administration. The arterial pressure and heart rate responses immediately following endotracheally and intravenously administered isoproterenol also were measured and compared. The arterial pressure and heart rate responses after endotracheally administered isoproterenol were much less than those following IV administration (P less than .005). In dogs the pharmacological effects following endotracheally and intravenously administered atropine and propranolol are similar, while the effects of endotracheally and intravenously administered isoproterenol differ greatly.\r"

Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically in 18 dogs. After three minutes, standard CPR was instituted using a mechanical resuscitator. Dogs were given phenylephrine or epinephrine at nine minutes and defibrillation was attempted at 12 minutes. Dogs underwent hemodynamic monitoring and pharmacologic support, if necessary, for an additional 90 minutes. At four, eight, 12, and 24 hours, a standard neurologic examination was performed and deficit scores were assigned by an observer blinded to the drug given. Fourteen of the 18 dogs were resuscitated. There were no statistically significant differences in the epinephrine- or phenylephrine-treated groups with regard to number of animals resuscitated, time and interventions required for resuscitation, initial cardiac rhythm post resuscitation, or occurrence of ventricular fibrillation during resuscitation. No differences were found in arterial, central venous, or myocardial perfusion pressures during CPR. Phenylephrine-treated dogs tended to have higher mean pressures in the critical care period (15 to 30 minutes), although this was not significant. Total neurologic deficit scores were 127.8 +/- 83.8 for the phenylephrine-treated group and 129.4 +/- 87.4 for the epinephrine group. No significant differences were found in the level of consciousness, cranial nerve function, motor skills, or general behavior scores. We conclude that there is no difference in neurologic or cardiovascular outcome when phenylephrine is compared to epinephrine in a canine model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\r"

The best single parameter for predicting theophylline levels was the last outpatient level (r = 0.484), which was within +/- 5 micrograms/mL of the presenting theophylline level in 62.5% of cases. However, there was considerable variability in theophylline levels in the other 37.5% of cases. The best combination of predictors was the last outpatient level and time since the last dose in patients taking a short-acting preparation. Even with this combination, however, 20.8% of predicted levels fell outside a range of +/- 5 micrograms/mL of the presenting theophylline levels. The only patients in whom a theophylline level could be predicted reliably were those who reported taking a sustained-release or short-acting preparation more than 15 or 8 hours prior to evaluation, respectively. In these patients, all presenting theophylline levels were in the subtherapeutic range (ie, less than 10 micrograms/mL), with 92% of the levels less than 5 micrograms/mL. Except for these patients, readily available theophylline determinations are necessary in order to optimize theophylline therapy with minimal risk of toxicity.\r"

Measured and observed variables from before and after initial therapy were analyzed for the three groups. There were no significant differences between the relapse and successful treatment groups, which were combined for analysis and termed the discharge group. Significant differences were noted between the admission and discharge groups only for dyspnea before and after therapy, accessory muscle use, inspiratory breath sounds and wheezing, and post-respiratory rates, but not for pulse or peak expiratory flow rates before or after therapy. The PPI was determined with multivariate logistic regression and is calculated using the following variables: inspiratory breath sounds, wheezing, and respiratory rates. A score of 0 correctly categorized 95% of admissions, but incorrectly categorized 34% of those discharged. Despite low specificity and limited usefulness as early predictors of admission, PPI variables may serve as valuable adjuncts to the physician in determining the outcome of acute asthma in children.\r"

Clinical toxicity was suspected in only 0.25% of all patients on digoxin, although almost 10% had levels above the therapeutic range. Deliberate digoxin overdoses were fatal in 50% of cases. This study shows a correlation between increasing digoxin levels and increasing mortality rates. We recommend the use of serum digoxin measurements to identify those asymptomatic patients with elevated levels. The physician should seriously consider the indications for initiating or continuing digoxin treatment in any patient because of an increased mortality in patients with levels of more than 1.0 ng/mL.\r"

The records of 84 patients who presented with a wide-complex tachycardia and who were able to provide a history were reviewed. The wide-complex tachycardia was proven by a later electrophysiologic study to be VT in 62 patients and SVT with aberration in 22 patients. History of prior myocardial infarction, history of congestive heart failure, and history of recent angina pectoris all had positive predictive values for VT of greater than 95%, but had sensitivities of 66%, 24%, and 24%, respectively. Age greater than 35 years had a sensitivity of 92% and a positive predictive value of 85% for VT. None of the clinical characteristics was strongly predictive for SVT; the best was age less than or equal to 35 years, which had a positive predictive value of 70%. We conclude that clinical variables may be helpful in the emergency department diagnosis of wide-complex tachycardias. If a patient with a wide-complex tachycardia has a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or recent angina pectoris, the tachycardia has a high likelihood of being ventricular in origin. However, there are no clinical variables that are highly predictive of SVT with aberration.\r"

They were divided into two groups, and the average time to successful venous isolation with each method at each of the three sites was studied. Both groups were similar in that all participants were medical personnel (interns, flight nurses, an equal number in each group) who had not previously performed venous cutdowns. In each group, at all sites, the new cutdown techniques resulted in a more rapid isolation of the vein. This was true in each case regardless of which technique was learned and attempted first.\r"

The mean time required for core rewarming to 30 C was 231 +/- 3 minutes for warm, humidified ventilation and 106 +/- 32 minutes for radio wave therapy (P less than .01).

If persons with AMI are to benefit from emergency thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, and other interventions, they may require emergency transfer within hours to one of the 10% of hospitals that provide these services. We report our experience with the emergency aeromedical treatment and transfer for acute intervention of 104 consecutive patients with suspected AMI. Between May 1983 and December 1984, 104 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were transported by an aeromedical team, including a physician and nurse, for emergency cardiac evaluation. AMI was confirmed in 94 (90%), and emergency intervention was carried out in 75 of 104 (72%). Ninety patients (87%) survived to be discharged from the hospital. There were no deaths during transport. Complications requiring treatment occurred in 13 (12%) of the patients during transport; physician skill or judgment was exercised in 27 of 104 transports (26%) and did not correlate with the Killip classification of physical findings. We conclude that emergency transfer of patients with AMI, traditionally considered hazardous, can be carried out safely using an aeromedical team. Physicians appear to play an important role in safe transport.\r"

Epidemiologic studies from different cities have shown conflicting results. We conducted a study to determine the effect of early CPR versus no CPR on resuscitability, 24-hour survival, and neurologic deficit in an animal model of cardiac arrest. Twenty-two mongrel dogs were subjected to five minutes of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation. In 11 dogs, closed-chest massage and ventilation with room air was begun immediately and was continued for five minutes. The other 11 dogs received no CPR. At five minutes defibrillation was attempted and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols were followed until the animal was resuscitated or died. No statistical difference in resuscitability or 24-hour survival between the two groups was demonstrated. Eight of 11 \"early CPR\" animals were resuscitated and survived 24 hours; six of 11 \"no CPR\" dogs were resuscitated, and five lived for 24 hours. A significant difference was demonstrated by the Student t test in neurologic deficit and ease of resuscitation. \"Early CPR\" dogs had no neurologic deficit, while \"no CPR\" dogs had a 41% deficit (P less than .01). \"Early CPR\" dogs were resuscitated in significantly less time once ACLS was started (29 versus 317 seconds), and required less electrical energy (100 versus 560 J), fewer countershocks (1.3 versus 4.0), and less epinephrine (0.1 versus 1.7 mg) than did \"no CPR\" animals. In this animal model of cardiac arrest, early CPR was shown to be beneficial to neurologic function and ease of resuscitation, even when ACLS was provided within five minutes.\r"

Physiologic and biochemical parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups; three of six (50%) of those receiving fluids through the external jugular vein and four of seven (57%) resuscitated through the femoral vein survived for three hours. Comparing survivors and nonsurvivors in both groups, those animals that lived for three hours maintained a higher pH, a greater urine output, and a lower serum lactate level. We conclude that the route of IV fluid administration does not affect the response to volume expansion; lactate levels, urine output, and pH provide valuable guides to the adequacy of resuscitation; and in appropriately resuscitated patients, even with serious liver lacerations, operative repair may be unnecessary except in the face of clinical or biochemical deterioration despite optimal fluid and blood replacement.\r"

Seven mongrel dogs were bled acutely to a systolic blood pressure of 50 to 60 mm Hg. The PASG then was inflated. One to two microcuries of Technetium-99-labeled macroaggregated albumin was infused into a peripheral vein in the hind leg, followed by a 10-mL/kg fluid bolus. The albumin particles that reached the central circulation were trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. Following infusion, a full body scan was performed. The percentage of injected fluid entering the central circulation was calculated by comparing the total body counts to counts localized to the thorax. Average mean arterial pressure was 111 mm Hg prior to bleeding, 47 mm Hg prior to shock trouser inflation, and 66 mm Hg after inflation. The percentage of injected Technetium-99-labeled albumin that reached the central circulation ranged from 80.5% to 99.6%, with a mean of 91.3%. We conclude that a significant percentage of IV fluids infused beneath inflated PASG will reach the central circulation.\r"

We conducted a study to examine the intraosseous route as an alternate means of vascular access for the administration of diazepam in a pentylenetetrazol-seizure model in pigs. Epileptogenic activity was induced with pentylenetetrazol 100 mg/kg in 15 domestic swine that had undergone craniotomies for electrocortical recording. Diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) was administered IV (n = 5) or intraosseously (n = 5); control animals received no drug (n = 5). Epileptogenic activity was suppressed below control levels within one minute in the IV group and within two minutes in the intraosseous group. A two-way analysis of variance did not show a significant difference between the IV and intraosseous routes; however, both were significantly different when compared to the control. There also was no significant difference in plasma diazepam levels between the two groups at one, two, five, ten, 15, and 20 minutes. Our study demonstrated that the intraosseous route is a rapid and effective alternative for diazepam administration.\r"

  ".W": "Emergency department treatment and disposition of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)-overdose patients remains a common and difficult problem. Various clinical findings have been proposed as toxicity indicators. To study the performance of QRS duration as a predictor of toxicity in our patient population, we retrospectively reviewed the cases of all patients presenting to our ED with TCA overdosage. The charts of 102 patients with quantitative or qualitative laboratory confirmation of TCA ingestion were reviewed for ED findings and hospital course with specific attention to the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) or seizures. The ED ECG revealed that 57 patients had a maximal 12-lead ECG QRS interval duration (QRS) of less than .10 seconds (Group 1). The remaining 45 patients had QRS greater than or equal to .10 seconds (Group 2). Three patients (5%) in Group 1 and three (6%) in Group 2 experienced VAs. Four patients (7%) in Group 1 and five (11%) in Group 2 experienced seizures. There was no significant difference in the rate of occurrence of VAs or seizures between the two groups. Of note was the fact that five of eight VAs and nine of 11 seizures occurred in the ED setting. We conclude that determination of QRS duration is not an accurate indicator of VA or seizure risk for all TCA-overdose populations. In particular, risk of toxic events during the emergency phase of TCA overdose does not appear to be indicated by evaluation of the QRS duration in the ED.\r"

A 60-second wound irrigation and scrub with a 1% povidone-iodine solution was the only difference in treatment between the two groups. Data relating to risk factors such as age; degree of contamination; type of closure; ethanol intoxication; mechanism of injury; and bone, joint, or tendon involvement were analyzed. Wounds were classified as clean, infected, or purulent at follow-up examination. One hundred five patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 395 remaining patients, 122 were contacted by phone and were classified based on their description of the wound; 273 were classified at reexamination in the ED. Of 201 povidone-iodine group wounds, 11 became infected; two of them (5.4%) were purulent. Of 194 control wounds, 30 became infected, of which 12 (15.46%) were purulent (P less than .01). These data suggest that use of a topical 1% povidone-iodine solution in traumatic lacerations prior to suturing reduces the incidence of wound infections.\r"

  ".W": "A study was conducted to examine the usefulness of blunt probing for evaluation of penetrating abdominal trauma. Ten anesthetized adult beagles weighing 8 to 17 kg were sacrificed by ventricular fibrillation following a standardized resuscitation protocol. Immediately thereafter, the abdomen was shaved and ten stab wounds were placed in the abdomen of each dog with #11 blade. A separate individual probed the wounds sequentially with a cotton swab and predicted on the basis of this examination whether the wound penetrated the parietal peritoneum (deep) or not (superficial). The abdomen then was opened and reflected, by a midline incision, and peritoneal penetration was verified visually by two observers. Statistical analysis of data was performed using the z test for binomial proportions. Fifty-nine of the 100 wounds were found to penetrate the parietal peritoneum. Examiners predicted 35 correctly, but called 24 of 59 superficial. Thirty-eight of 41 superficial wounds were identified correctly; three were incorrectly called deep. Sensitivity was .59 (z = 1.432, P greater than .5); specificity was .93 (z = 5.466, P less than .001). Blunt probing may be a useful technique if peritoneal penetration is determined, but it is inaccurate in predicting peritoneal nonpenetration. If violation of the peritoneum is not determined with this technique, other methods must be used.\r"

Despite the delineation of specific goals and objectives of such training, actual field exposure and experience in prehospital care have remained voluntary and often sporadic. We designed a resident experience for on-scene attendance at selected incidents and surveyed our residents for their opinion of the curriculum. We also examined field records to determine the nature of field calls and the numbers and types of procedures carried out by second- and third-year residents. During the six-month review period, 158 cardiac arrests were attended, 58 difficult intubations were carried out, 49 central or peripheral lines were started, and 24 severely injured patients were treated on-scene or en route to the hospital. The average response time by the resident to the scene was nine minutes, and the average on-scene time was 20 minutes. Residents completing the survey indicated support for the program and agreed that it has enriched their learning experience. Combined with an air (helicopter and fixed-wing) and ground critical care transport service, the EMS in-field experience has provided opportunities for residents to make rapid decisions, to appreciate the field team's perspective, to report concisely and clearly to colleagues, and to practice required advanced skills. We believe that a formal, planned, and balanced in-field curriculum can afford an opportunity for unique educational experiences that will enrich the graduate program in emergency medicine.\r"

The pain and apprehension associated with many ED visits have been thought to elevate blood pressure readings falsely in this setting. To resolve this question, all patients admitted to the ED of a university hospital during a one-year period were screened prospectively for hypertension. Follow-up was attempted for patients who, on admission and discharge, had systolic pressures higher than 159 mm Hg or diastolic pressures higher than 94 mm Hg. A total of 239 patients met these criteria, and follow-up was obtained in 45% of the cases. Significant hypertension (systolic greater than 159 mm Hg or diastolic greater than 94 mm Hg) was found in 35% of these patients on follow-up. Borderline hypertension (systolic, 140 to 159 mm Hg; or diastolic, 90 to 94 mm Hg) was documented in 33% of the patients. Thirty-two percent were found to be normotensive when evaluated in a follow-up visit. The number of patients experiencing pain at the time of their initial ED visit was similar among the three groups. Almost half the patients with hypertension on follow-up needed further workup or therapy. The ED can be a useful screening site for hypertension; elevated blood pressure on discharge should ensure referral for follow-up evaluation and therapy.\r"

Failure to demonstrate such a difference when it actually exists is known as \"type II\" error, and its probability of occurring is termed \"beta.\" The purpose of our study was to determine the distribution of beta errors in negative trials in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians (JACEP) (1972-1979) and Annals of Emergency Medicine (1980-1984). All negative comparative clinical trials appearing in JACEP and Annals from volume 1 (1972) to volume 13 (1984) were surveyed and were eligible for inclusion in the study. A trial was defined as negative if the investigator specifically stated that there was no significant difference in outcome between the experimental and control groups. For each negative trial the following parameters were calculated: beta error, based on the sample size used and the difference determined to be important to detect clinically; sample size required to detect a clinically meaningful difference as determined by the authors of this study; and minimum true difference that had to be detected in the trial at a beta equal to 0.20, to discern a statistically significant result. For the 13 years surveyed, we found 21 endpoints in 14 negative trials that were analyzable. Only one of the trials (7.1%) addressed the issues of beta errors and sample size determination. In the remaining 13 negative trials, the calculated beta error ranged from .60 to .97. For the endpoints analyzed, a sample size of up to 450 times larger than that used would have been required to detect a clinically important difference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most frequent symptoms were bite site pain (79%), abdominal pain (71%), and lower extremity weakness (57%). The most frequent signs were bite site lesions and abdominal tenderness or rigidity (71%). Laboratory and radiographic studies did not influence the initial emergency department evaluation. All drug therapies resulted in good clinical outcome despite two complications, and we therefore believe that the use of antivenom for symptomatic relief should be discouraged.\r"

Eight patients with cavitary disease caused by RMP-resistant M. kansasii were treated with SMX-containing regimens that also included high dose INH (900 mg), EMB (25 mg/kg), and an aminoglycoside (either streptomycin or amikacin). Patients were treated initially in the hospital for 4 to 10 wk. In 7 of the 8 patients, sputum cultures became negative in a mean of 10 wk (range, 7 to 14 wk). Acquired drug resistance to INH, RMP, and EMB can be demonstrated in M. kansasii, and SMX in combination with other agents chosen on the basis of MIC determinations are effective in the treatment of disease caused by RMP-resistant M. kansasii.\r"

To learn if we could observe increased or focal fibrin deposition and assess the kinetics of plasma fibrinogen turnover during severe acute respiratory failure, we injected technetium 99m-labeled human purified fibrinogen (Tc-HF) and used gamma camera scanning for as long as 12 h in 13 sequential patients as soon as possible after ICU admission. The fibrinogen uptake rates were determined by calculating the lung:heart radioactivity ratios at each time point. Slopes of the lung:heart ratio versus time were compared between ARDS and mild acute respiratory failure (ARF). The slope of the lung:heart Tc-HF ratio of the 9 patients with ARDS (2.9 +/- 0.4 units) was markedly higher (p less than 0.02) than the slope of the 4 patients with mild ARF (1.1 +/- 0.4) and the 3 patients studied 5 to 9 months after recovery from respiratory failure (0.7 +/- 0.07). In the 1 patient with ARDS and the 2 patients with mild ARF studied both during acute lung injury and after recovery, the lung:heart Tc-HF ratio had decreased at recovery. To compare the pulmonary uptake of Tc-HF to 99mTc-labeled human serum albumin (Tc-HSA), 5 patients were injected with 10 mCi of Tc-HSA, and scanning of the thorax was performed with a similar sequential imaging protocol 24 h after conclusion of the Tc-HF study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 12 patients with COPD receiving AV with maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) less than or equal to -20 cm H2O and FVC greater than or equal to 10 ml/kg. The P0.1, VT, frequency, mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI), inspiratory time to total breath cycle duration (TI/Ttot), and arterial blood gases were determined just prior to weaning, within 5 min after discontinuing AV (Time 0), and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min. Five of the 12 patients failed to wean, defined as requiring AV within 24 h after discontinuing AV. At Time 0, all patients who subsequently failed to wean had a P0.1 of greater than 6 cm H2O, and those who were successfully weaned had a P0.1 of less than 6 cm H2O (p less than 0.001), although the arterial blood gas determinations were comparable in both groups. Throughout the study period, P0.1 in the patients who failed to wean was persistently higher than in the successfully weaned patients. Despite the high P0.1, VT and VT/TI decreased significantly at the termination of the study compared with those at Time 0 in 3 of the patients who failed to wean. Tachypnea was not useful in predicting failure to wean. The TI/Ttot in the patients who failed to wean was persistently lower than in the successfully weaned patients. We conclude that P0.1 is an important indicator for successful weaning.\r"

Therefore, we studied the effects of infusing ketanserin, a 5-HT blocking agent, upon pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange in 10 patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism. These patients evidenced 45 +/- 17% mean angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction. Ketanserin significantly decreased the mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 26 +/- 6 to 23 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The total pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 9.1 +/- 3.2 to 8.3 +/- 2.5 mm Hg/L X min X m2 (p less than 0.001). However, the mean cardiac index was unchanged. The systemic arterial and right atrial pressures were significantly decreased after ketanserin. The PaO2 increased in all patients from 60.5 +/- 12.6 to 66.5 +/- 13.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), whereas the venous admixture was unchanged. This was attributed to an increased PVO2 (27 +/- 7 to 30 +/- 5 mmHg, p less than 0.01) secondary to a reduction of calculated peripheral oxygen consumption during ketanserin infusion. The results indicate ketanserin is a mild pulmonary vasodilator and can reduce the pulmonary hypertension and increase the PaO2 after pulmonary embolism.\r"

We believe that this is the first time that these have been reported. Because the proximal subunits of the outer dynein arm are present and attached to the A microtubule, we argue that in these patients there is no structural abnormality of the A microtubule or the A-tubule attachment sites for outer and inner arms and radial spokes. Also, because a majority of cilia in these patients were motile, we believe that the data from this study support the concept that the outer dynein arms are not required for some motion but probably required for normal motility; however, the central microtubules, central microtubular complex, and probably the B tubules are essential for motility.\r"

With transtracheal oxygen delivery, subjects significantly (p less than 0.0001) reduced their oxygen requirement while maintaining previous exercise capacity. No change occurred in pH, PaCO2, or in spirometry. Of the 10 subjects, 4 have continued catheter use with excellent acceptance. Three experienced complications after insertion, which necessitated catheter removal. Two elected to discontinue the catheter despite subjective improvement in dyspnea. One subject died after an exacerbation of COPD. Our experience confirms findings of others that transtracheal oxygen delivery significantly reduces oxygen requirement. However, in this study, we encountered complications requiring removal of the catheter and variability in patient acceptance. Results indicate the need for additional controlled studies to identify which patients will benefit most from those potentially promising system for delivery of chronic oxygen therapy.\r"

The total mass of dry aerosol discharged directly from the actuator, from the auxiliary devices, and through the oropharyngeal model was determined by collecting the aerosol on the absolute filter and weighing the filter. Aerosol depositions in the auxiliary devices and in the oropharynx as well as the amount of aerosol delivered past the oropharynx were determined as percentages of the total aerosol mass output from the actuator alone. Six different MDI aerosols, 3 bronchodilators, and 3 corticosteroids were used. With the actuator alone, oropharyngeal deposition ranged from 33 to 71% at an inspiratory flow rate of 0.33 L/s, depending on the type of MDI aerosols. Aerosol delivery into the lung was 29 to 67%. With the auxiliary devices, oropharyngeal deposition markedly decreased to the range below 6% regardless of the type of auxiliary device and aerosol. A major deposition (23 to 72%) occurred in the auxiliary devices except for Nebuhaler in which a much reduced deposition (8 to 18%) occurred. Aerosol delivery into the lung was in the range of 40 to 72% with the open-end tube, 26 to 62% with the Aerochamber, 34 to 60% with InspirEase, and 31 to 92% with Nebuhaler. Although a substantial increase in aerosol delivery (as much as 38%) was found with a large size Nebuhaler, the aerosol delivery with other smaller auxiliary devices used was comparable to those obtained without the auxiliary devices.\r"

We determined if respiratory mechanics changed progressively during anesthesia by measuring total respiratory elastance and resistance and their respective lung and chest wall components in 10 young adults free of cardiorespiratory disease at the start and end of premedicated anesthesia administered for orthopedic surgery (isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane, minimal alveolar concentration approximately 1.5 in 60% N2O-40% O2; interval between measurements was 0.42 to 5.0 h, mean +/- SD = 2.08 +/- 1.56 h). Static lung recoil pressure, static total respiratory and lung elastance, dynamic lung elastance, chest wall elastance, and total respiratory and lung and chest wall resistances were measured during steady-state breathing (greater than 10 min after induction). Resistance of the endotracheal tube, pneumotachygraph and connectors were subtracted from the total flow resistance to obtain total intrinsic resistance. Average values of static lung recoil pressure and all elastances and chest wall resistance did not change significantly from start to end of the study, regardless of the elapsed time. Total respiratory and lung resistance increased by 49% (p less than 0.05) and 45% (p less than 0.02), respectively, but were not time-dependent. We conclude that lung static recoil and total respiratory and lung elastances did not change beyond the first 10 min after induction, regardless of duration of anesthesia. The increases in total respiratory and lung resistance were small, independent of duration of anesthesia, and may have been due to accumulated airway secretions.\r"

Inocula (0.05 ml) were 93 to 97% conidia in nonpyrogenic normal saline (NPNS) with greater than 90% viability. Quantitative cultures of the lungs and trachea of mice killed immediately after injection of 10(4) conidia (FW) confirmed that the inoculum was evenly distributed between the lungs, with virtually no conidia retained in the trachea. Animals were observed for 354 days for weight change, mortality, extrapulmonary dissemination and histopathologic changes. Mice inoculated with 10(4) FW began dying on Day 44, with a median survival of 92 days. A decrease in mean weight compared with that in control mice was noted by Day 55. In contrast, mice inoculated with 10(4) CR or NPNS neither died with blastomycosis nor lost weight in 329 days. Variation of the FW inoculum by tenfold increments produced comparable dose-dependent alterations in both mortality rate and weight change curves. Fifty percent survival was 32, 36, 92, or 172 days for mice inoculated with 10(6), 10(5), 10(4), or 10(3) conidia, respectively. Dissemination from the lungs to the liver, spleen, kidney, testis, and brain was found in the cachectic mice that were killed. Pathologic features of pulmonary and disseminated infections were comparable to those in human disease. This quantitative, reproducible model of chronic murine blastomycosis mimics the human disease in many respects and should provide a basis for future studies of the immunology, pathogenesis, and therapy of chronic blastomycosis.\r"

Cumulative concentration response curves were obtained to the agonists in bronchial spiral strips in the absence and in the presence of BAY K8644. Contractile responses to histamine were significantly (p less than 0.05) enhanced by BAY K8644 (10(-6) M) at concentrations between 10(-7) M and 3 X 10(-6) M and there was a significant decrease in the histamine EC50 (the concentration producing half the maximal response). Responses to low concentrations of KCl (10(-4) M to 3 X 10(-3) M) were also potentiated. BAY K8644 did not affect carbachol-induced contractions. We conclude that calcium influx through VDC occurs in response to KCl and histamine but not to carbachol. Such findings could explain the variability in efficacy of calcium channel antagonists in inhibiting various forms of bronchospasm.\r"

Multiple area air samples were analyzed for total elutriated dust concentration (range: 0.15 to 2.5 mg/m3) and endotoxin (range: 0.002 to 0.55 microgram U.S. Reference Endotoxin/m3). The cotton worker population was stratified by current and cumulative dust or endotoxin exposure. Groups were compared for FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC%, % change in FEV1 over the shift (delta FEV1%), and prevalences of chronic bronchitis and byssinosis, and linear and logistic regression models were constructed. No dose-response relationships were demonstrated comparing dust concentration to any pulmonary function or symptom variable. A dose-response trend was seen with the current endotoxin level and FEV1, delta FEV1%, and the prevalence of byssinosis and chronic bronchitis, except for the highest exposure level group in which a reversal of the trend was seen. The regression coefficients for current endotoxin exposure were significant (p less than 0.05) in the models for FEV1 and chronic bronchitis but not in the models for delta FEV1% (i.e., acute change in FEV1) or byssinosis prevalence. The coefficient for dust level was never significant in the models.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Genetic influences on various spirometric measures were estimated with twinship intrapair correlations adjusted using a regression model to control for similarities in the anthropomorphic characteristics of twins, and for the effects of a number of environmental factors that included childhood respiratory illness, occupational dust exposure, and smoking history. A significant influence of smoking on all air-flow measures was observed in this population for whom genetic similarities were adjusted. However, highly significant adjusted intrapair correlations for all spirometric measures, ranging from 0.52 to 0.76, were observed for the MZ twins. The intrapair correlations for the DZ twins were approximately one-half the magnitude of those for the MZ twins. These data suggest that a large proportion of the measured variability in PF may be accounted for by genetic influences other than those associated with body size.\r"

The predicted work capacity was often incorrect when compared with measured maximal oxygen uptake (VO2). One third (22 of 66) of those predicted to have reduced work capacity had normal measured work capacity, and 46 of 148 workers (31%) predicted to have normal work capacity were found to have low maximal VO2 during exercise. Of 134 men for whom predicted work capacity was uncertain, maximal VO2 during exercise was low in 49 (37%), normal in 81 (60%), and remained indeterminate in 4 (3%). Thus, of the 138 workers who had low measured VO2, 43 were correctly predicted to have normal work capacity, 46 were incorrectly predicted, and the prediction was uncertain in 49. Only a few were limited by respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disorders limited 69% of those with a low maximal VO2 during exercise. Accordingly, resting VC, FEV1, and DLCO had a poor correlation with exercise performance. Finally, we found that resting DLCO was a poor predictor of abnormal exercise AaPO2, dead-space/tidal volume ratio, or arterial end-tidal PCO2 difference. We conclude that exercise testing is needed for accurate work capacity assessment in impairment evaluation. Exercise testing also facilitates the identification of the major limiting system in those with low work capacity.\r"

Patients with acute silicone pneumonitis were admitted because of fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemia (mean PaO2, 58 +/- 14 mm Hg). Most patients in this group had received new silicone injections within hours of admission, but one presented with the same clinical syndrome a few hours after a brawl. The alveolitis of acute silicone pneumonitis was characterized by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils (p less than 0.05 compared with those in normal persons with a similar smoking history). Evidence of alveolar hemorrhage was also present in some cases. Alveolar macrophages contained large, pleomorphic, cytoplasmic inclusions, which were identified as silicone by atomic absorption and infrared spectrometry. Patients with latent silicone pneumonitis underwent clinical study at much longer times after the silicone fluid injections because they developed local inflammatory phenomena at the sites of previous injections. Pulmonary function studies usually showed slight restrictive changes, and bronchoalveolar lavage disclosed abnormalities similar to those found in patients with acute silicone pneumonitis, although to a lesser degree. Thus, illicit silicone fluid injection carries a serious respiratory risk since it can induce pneumonitis, followed in some patients by respiratory failure.\r"

Under double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled conditions, we intranasally administered the anticholinergic atropine methonitrate (AM) to assess its tolerance in uninfected adults and therapeutic efficacy in volunteers with experimental rhinovirus (RV) colds. Healthy adults given sprays of AM intranasally 250 or 500 micrograms 4 times a day for 5 days developed nasal dryness and systemic side effects more often than did placebo (P) recipients. In 2 separate challenge studies, treatments were begun with AM 125 micrograms 3 times a day (AM = 8, P = 7) or AM 250 micrograms 4 times a day (AM = 9, P = 7) for 5 days, 24 h after intranasal inoculation of RV type 39. The low AM dose was well tolerated but had no effect on nasal mucus weights or nasal symptom scores in persons with RV colds. The higher dose of AM was associated with subjective drying and a reduction in nasal mucus production. These findings suggest that cholinergic mechanisms have a role in the pathogenesis of RV colds but that more work is necessary to determine if anticholinergic compounds will be of practical value in their treatment.\r"

Two or more bronchoalveolar lavages (mean, 3; maximum, 5) were performed on each of 32 patients who were followed for periods as long as 7 yr (mean, 2.5 yr, median, 4 yr). The majority were studied before and during treatments with prednisolone alone or with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. A total of 90 lavages were performed, and the changes in BAL inflammatory cell percentage counts were compared with defined categories of clinical progress. At initial lavage, 97% of the patients had an increased percentage of at least 1 BAL cell type. On follow-up, 12 patients showed definite and sustained clinical improvement, and their serial lavage cell counts tended to return towards normal. Falls in neutrophils were significant in patients responding to prednisolone, whereas falls in eosinophils were significant in those responding to cyclophosphamide. By contrast, in patients who failed to improve, neutrophil and eosinophil counts tended to remain elevated. However, several nonresponders appeared to have clinically stable disease, demonstrating that persisting granulocytes are not necessarily paralleled by clinical deterioration. Consecutive BAL cell counts in the pair of samples before and after introduction of prednisolone showed no overall change in any lavage cell type to suggest that the drug has a general effect independent of clinical progress. A similar comparison for cyclophosphamide showed falls in eosinophil percentage counts, but these were mainly responders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From retrospective data in 24 subjects, we developed a formula to predict allergen PC20 and examined its accuracy prospectively in 26 new subjects undergoing allergen inhalation test with doubling allergen concentrations. Allergen PC20 (APC20) was predicted from histamine PC20 (HPC20) and skin sensitivity (SS) by the formula: Log10 (APC20) = 0.69 Log10 (HPC20 X SS) + 0.11 (r = 0.85). Allergen PC20 was accurately predicted in 6, and overestimated or underestimated by 1 doubling concentration in 11, by 2 concentrations in 6, by 3 concentrations in 3, and by greater than 3 concentrations in none. From the total of 50 subjects, a new relationship was developed: Log10 (APC10) = 0.68 log10 (HPC20 X SS) (r = 0.82) from which 46 of 50 (92%) of allergen PC20 values fall within 2 doubling concentrations of the regression line (and all within 3). Early airway responsiveness to a given allergen can be predicted within a +/- 8-fold range, which is better than some investigator's test reproducibility of +/- 1 log (10-fold). Allergen inhalation tests to determine early asthmatic responsiveness to different IgE-mediated allergens can probably be replaced by the simpler and safer determinations of allergen sensitivity (SS, RAST) and histamine or methacholine airway responsiveness.\r"

Thirty-two percent of 1,088 physicians who graduated after 1974 had been exposed to 3 or more patients with infectious tuberculosis in the previous year. Fifty-eight percent of 738 unimmunized, tuberculin-negative physicians who had been exposed to one or more patients with infectious tuberculosis in the previous year had tuberculin tests every 1 to 2 yr. Forty-nine percent of 597 unimmunized tuberculin reactors with similar occupational exposure had chest roentgenograms every 1 to 2 yr. The BCG-vaccinated physicians were less likely to have frequent tuberculin tests but no different frequency of chest roentgenograms. Eight percent of 1,460 unimmunized tuberculin reactors received isoniazid chemoprophylaxis, including 39% of 128 tuberculin reactors who graduated after 1974 (the majority of the latter were younger than 35 yr of age). Of 66 physicians who had active tuberculosis during medical school or after graduation, 20 (30%) had not received any antituberculosis chemotherapy, whereas 2 of 46 who did, received chemotherapy only after a second episode of tuberculosis. In summary, our study documents poor compliance by physicians with recommended policies for the prevention of tuberculosis in health care workers.\r"

The counts rarely exceeded 0.5% in sarcoidosis, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, or asbestosis or in control samples, but they were as much as 10-fold higher in EAA (p less than 0.001). Higher concentrations of histamine were demonstrated in EAA BAL-cell lysates, and histamine was released from cells challenged with anti-IgE. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that the cells were mast cells that differed from mast cells in dermal connective tissue and alveolar interstitial tissue but resembled bronchial subepithelial tissue mast cells in showing more features suggestive of activation. However, they showed more marked degranulation, and many were young. By light microscopy, they also resembled \"mucosal\" rather than \"connective\" tissue mast cells since granule staining was prevented by formaldehyde. Mast cell counts fell to normal after removal of patients from exposure, but lymphocyte increases, including atypical \"blast\" forms, persisted despite clinical recovery. Neutrophils were also increased before, but rarely after, removal. We suggest that EAA may provide an example of a human disease to support recent evidence that some delayed hypersensitivity disorders involve mast cells as well as lymphocytes.\r"

These fractions differed in their cell volume and proliferative response to serum, but not in their response to growth-inhibiting soluble factors from lung mononuclear cells. The differences in proliferative capacity were not maintained during in vitro culture, and were not the result of the fractionation procedure selecting for cells at a particular point in the cell cycle. However, the fractionation procedure did separate cells based in part on their propensity to traverse the cell cycle. The least dense fraction was enriched for larger cells that were noncycling or slowly cycling, whereas the densest fibroblast fraction was enriched for small, rapidly cycling cells. Thus, there is morphologic and functional variability within adult human lung fibroblast lines. This phenotypic variability may be an important factor controlling the pulmonary fibrotic response.\r"

Two experimental approaches were used. To detect possible monocyte influx, we radiolabeled blood monocytes by a continuous infusion of tritiated thymidine for 7 days and assayed lavaged alveolar macrophages for radiolabel by autoradiography. Although heavily labeled monocytes occurred in the blood, no heavily labeled cells were detectable among lavaged alveolar macrophages by cohort analysis. To evaluate macrophage proliferation in vivo, we injected normal unlabeled rats with colchicine and examined lavaged alveolar macrophages for arrested mitoses. Mitotic figures were observed among lavaged alveolar macrophages, and calculations at serial times after colchicine injection indicated that 1.83% of alveolar macrophages entered mitosis each day. On the basis of these 2 lines of evidence, we conclude that the alveolar macrophage cell population in normal rats is supported mainly by cellular proliferation in situ rather than direct monocyte influx from the blood compartment.\r"

Both antigen dose-response and kinetic analyses of the appearance of AFC in the HLN and lung parenchyma were performed. There was a direct relationship between the dose of SRBC administered intratracheally and the magnitude of the AFC-responses in HLN and lungs; AFC appeared in HLN at substantially lower intratracheally administered doses of SRBC than in lungs. The major effect of adoptive transfer or of systemic priming was to shift the dose-response curves significantly to the left, such that AFC appeared in HLN and lungs at lower antigen doses than in unprimed mice. Kinetic analyses showed that the initial appearance and the peak concentrations of AFC occurred earlier in HLN than they did in lung parenchyma. Priming shifted the kinetic curves to the left, accelerating the appearance of AFC; the sequential relationship between AFC appearance in HLN and in lungs was preserved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The first individual operated upon in 1955 was asymptomatic. Nine patients had congenital tracheoesophageal fistula with atresia, four esophageal varices, 31 advanced obliterative esophagitis, and 23 corrosive destruction. In seven patients, severe esophagitis followed esophagogastrectomy, four had unsuccessful operations for achalasia, and seven had colon bypass following esophageal perforation. Eleven early nonfatal complications occurred. Remote nonfatal complications were seen in six patients. Three early deaths followed dehiscence of an intrathoracic esophago-colon anastomosis, and one patient died from peritonitis (4%). Four individuals died over the study period, and five patients were lost to follow-up. The late results in 72 patients show that 61 (84%) believe they have a satisfactory result, nine (13%) individuals are symptomatic, and two patients (4%) are classified as failures. Early complications have been minimized by employing preoperative intestinal angiograms and anastomotic stapling techniques, and by using the Doppler intraoperatively to prognosticate colon blood flow. Significant observations have been: Anastomosis in the neck is preferable; the transplanted colon dilates from loss of motor activity but is functionally adequate; an isoperistaltic segment is preferable, but antiperistaltic segments can be used; and colonic mucosa is relatively resistant to acid-peptic digestion.\r"

The extremes are to always perform cholecystectomy or to perform cholecystectomy only when there are palpable stones or the gallbladder is grossly diseased. Since 1975, 136 cholecystectomies have been performed simultaneously in 724 patients who had a gastric bariatric operation. Cholecystectomy had been performed before the bariatric operation in 120 and was required later in 18 patients. The clinical records, anesthesia, pathology, and operative reports provide the data for this study. Simultaneous cholecystectomy was done through the vertical midline incision used for gastric bariatric operation. No patients had the gallbladder bed closed or were drained. Operative cholangiogram were not performed because this procedure would have been difficult and significantly prolonged because of the obesity. No patients have developed postoperative choledocholithiasis. One patient developed a complication related to cholecystectomy, a common bile duct stricture. The length of the operation and the postoperative hospitalization with and without simultaneous cholecystectomy were compared. The results of intraoperative ultrasound studies performed upon these patients are described and discussed. It is concluded that cholecystectomy should be performed simultaneously with all gastric bariatric operations when there is gross or echogenic evidence of gallbladder disease. Cholecystectomy does not significantly prolong or complicate the gastric bariatric operation.\r"

These indices were lactate dehydrogenase evaluation, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, hypocalcemia, and fluid sequestration. In addition, seven of 18 abscess patients had six or more indices present as opposed to five of 161 pancreatitis patients. This was significant at P less than 0.05 level. The etiology of the pancreatitis was not a significant factor. Once an abscess developed, gram-negative infections were polymicrobial (8 of 9 patients) and were associated with a 56 per cent mortality. The gram-positive abscesses (6 patients) were all monomicrobial and none of these patients died. In addition, age greater than 55 years, serum glucose greater than 200 mg%, hematocrit decrease of 10 per cent, and fluid sequestration greater than 6 L were associated with a 50 per cent or greater mortality. The authors believe that patients presenting initially with six or more severity indices, especially the six mentioned above, are at significantly increased risk for developing a pancreatic abscess and those abscess patients with gram-negative abscesses, as well as having any of the four severity indices previously mentioned, have a much worse prognosis.\r"

Sixty-three (97%) of the patients were able to complete the lavage. Fifty-five (85%) of these tolerated the preparation without event. Unpleasant reactions of nausea, vomiting, or fullness resolved in most patients by decreasing the rate of ingestion. Twenty-seven patients had associated medical illnesses that may have been aggravated by volume overload, but none of these experienced any adverse effects from the lavage. Most patients completed the total lavage ingestion of 4 L in 4 hours, which resulted in a 1-day preparation prior to operation. There were no wound or septic complications in any of the lavage patients. This clinical review indicates that PEG-ELS is a safe, rapid, and effective mechanical bowel preparation that should be able to reduce in-hospital preparation time for most patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\r"

Gore-Tex is presented as an ideal material for correction of the rectal sling because of its inert properties and porous structure which allows tissue incorporation. The problem of postoperative fecal impaction created by pulling the sling too tight has also been circumvented by placing the sling posteriorly, leaving the anterior rectal wall free to distend. The Ripstein procedure is described in detail, and a series of 23 patients is presented who have had successful rectal prolapse repair using the new rectal sling procedure. There have been no recurrences and minimal morbidity in these cases.\r"

Despite this overall decline, it has been shown that the rate of complications from duodenal ulcers, specifically perforation, has remained virtually unchanged. A retrospective look at the perforated duodenal ulcers admitted to the Medical College of Georgia between 1978 and 1984 revealed a total of 45 patients with 39 survivors. Eighty per cent of the 39 underwent follow-up endoscopy in a period of 4 to 12 weeks after perforation. Twenty-six of these patients had been treated with omental patch and an average of 7.5 weeks of cimetidine. Sixty-five per cent of those treated with omental patch and cimetidine continued to have active ulcer disease on endoscopic follow-up. Twenty-three per cent were asymptomatic despite active disease. Perforation appears to represent the severest form in the spectrum of duodenal ulcer disease. H2 antagonists have been shown to heal over 90 per cent of duodenal ulcers with 8 weeks of therapy. This study reveals them to be less effective with the perforated ulcer. It is recommended that patients treated with omental patch and cimetidine be followed closely with endoscopy and be considered for longer medical therapy.\r"

There was a difference (P = .05 level) in hourly drainage from women patients, 20.49 cc from Levin, and 25.14 cc from sump tubes. There were no major complications attributable to the tubes. Output from tubes was usually low in early postoperative hours, rising steadily for the first 3 days. Drainage per nursing shift decreased throughout the day. Fever is associated with nasogastric tube use. In the absence of other etiology, a diagnosis of \"tube fever\" can be made. There is no difference in the clinical efficacy of Levin and sump tubes.

The mesenteric cysts were incidental findings in four of the nine patients (45%). Enucleation was the treatment of choice in eight patients (88%), followed by right hemicolectomy in one patient. Two patients had complications, one wound infection and one urinary tract infection. Simple enucleation has proven to be adequate treatment in most instances. Large bowel resection may be necessary when mesenteric cysts are located in the mesocolon and enucleation is not feasible without compromising the blood supply to the adjacent bowel.\r"

These findings were prospectively validated in an independent testing set of 275 patients with myocardial infarction, 271 (99%) of whom either met diagnostic criteria for myocardial infarction or had recurrent ischemic pain within 24 hours of admission. These data suggest that 24 hours is nearly always a sufficient period to exclude myocardial infarction in patients without recurrent chest pain.\r"

Before the head injuries occurred, normal serum levels of sodium had been found in two of the three patients. Hyponatremia (105 to 117 meq/L) was associated with persistently increased urinary excretion of sodium. The patients appeared dehydrated and had lost weight. The mean plasma level of antidiuretic hormone was 5.0 +/- 1.6 (SD) pg/mL, which was relatively high despite decreased osmolality. Plasma renin activity was suppressed to 0.25 +/- 0.13 ng/mL X h, and plasma aldosterone levels measured low-normal or normal. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels remained unchanged after the patients were given furosemide and placed in an upright position. The hyponatremia promptly resolved after the administration of fludrocortisone acetate, 0.1 to 0.4 mg/d. These observations indicate that severe hyponatremia occurs in elderly persons rapidly after head injuries, that it responds well to mineralocorticoid hormone therapy, and that both central nervous system and renal components may be involved in the mechanisms of action of the disorder.\r"

We sought to determine whether pulmonary function abnormalities occur as a result of exposure to high altitudes in persons with hemoglobin AS. In a prospective study, 13 men with hemoglobin AS (\"cases\") and 13 controls (hemoglobin AA) matched by age, sex, and race were exposed to five to seven altitude simulations (ranging from 1524 to 7620 m [5000 to 25,000 ft]) in a hypobaric chamber. Measurements of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced midexpiratory flow were obtained before and after each exposure. Data before exposures did not differ statistically between cases and controls. Altitude had no systematic effect on DLco or spirometric values in cases compared with values in controls (p greater than 0.05). Individual declines in forced vital capacity or DLco of more than 10% occurred with similar frequency in both groups. Measurements made after the series of exposures showed no change from those made before. We conclude that short serial exposures to hypoxia at high altitudes does not acutely or cumulatively alter DLco or spirometric values in healthy, nonexercising persons with sickle cell trait.\r"

Tests for IgM antibody against hepatitis A virus were positive in the 7 patients at the onset of disease, with decreasing levels in 3 of the 4 patients tested during the evolution of the illness. Stools collected during the relapse phase showed hepatitis A virus by immune electron microscopy, radioimmunoassay, and molecular hybridization using a 32P-labeled cDNA-hepatitis A virus probe. Stools collected from 4 of these patients 6 to 12 months after the onset of disease were negative for the virus. The finding of hepatitis A virus in the stool of these patients during the relapse phase strongly implicates hepatitis A virus as the causative agent of the clinical relapse.\r"

Liver function improved, bile duct scarring did not worsen, and repeat liver biopsy samples have shown striking improvement. A 60-year-old man with long-standing ulcerative colitis and repeated exacerbations of sclerosing cholangitis had a similar response to low-dose methotrexate, 2.5 mg every 12 hours three times each week (7.5 mg/wk), during a 6-year period. Recurrent episodes of cholangitis have disappeared, liver function has become normal, bile duct scarring has not worsened, and liver histologic findings have become normal.

Both patients with predominantly IgG cold-reactive antibodies were treated with splenectomy and subsequently had a rise in more than hemoglobin levels that has been maintained for over 36 months without additional therapy. Two of the other three patients were treated with glucocorticoids only and responded similarly. These data indicate that a subset of patients with cold hemagglutinin disease have IgG cold-reactive antibodies.

We identified two categories of symptoms: angina and syncope, which develop during a fully compensated stage of aortic stenosis (\"prefailure symptoms\"); and dyspnea or congestive failure, which signifies various degrees of left ventricular malfunction. The preponderance of soft or medium intensity systolic murmur and normal or widened pulse pressure emphasizes the changing clinical picture of aortic stenosis in an aging population.

Although almost 80% of the units were hospital based, most (61%) provided care for outpatients. Nearly half (47%) began operation in 1983 or later; of those in existence before 1983, two thirds have increased their capacity since then. The types of personnel and their training differed substantially among units. Fifty percent of the physicians had had no formal training in geriatrics. Of the 104 units, 99 (95%) did routine assessment. The estimated time spent per new patient in outpatient units was 2.7 +/- 2.1 (SD) hours. These data suggest that geriatric assessment units are proliferating rapidly, have differing structures, and consume substantial resources. Further efforts are needed to define their optimal structure, targets, and function.\r"

The humane physician can be characterized by four distinct qualities: technical competence, humanistic attitude, knowledge of humanistic concepts, and humanistic behavior. Education in the humanities can foster humanistic attitudes, but it cannot promise to lead to changes in behavior. Likewise, although formal training in communication teaches the skills necessary for humanistic behavior, without an understanding of humanistic concepts these skills may not serve medical or moral ends. Evaluation of the humane physician must also include modalities that test attitude, knowledge, and behavior. Testing one characteristic does not ensure competence in other areas; knowledge of the requirements for informed consent, for example, does not guarantee one's ability to discuss this concept effectively with patients. In this article, we suggest ways to combine the humanities and communication skills in the clinical setting and we emphasize both the training and the evaluation of humane physicians.\r"

This 26.5-kilobase plasmid encodes resistance strictly to 14-membered macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, and oleandomycin. Resistance to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics was not observed even after a prior induction stimulus with various MLS antibiotics. Plasmid pNE24 was found to express resistance constitutively and manifested a low to intermediate MIC (62.5 micrograms/ml) for erythromycin. The resistance gene, designated erpA, appears to mediate resistance by altering the permeability of the host cell for erythromycin, because the measured uptake of 14C-labeled erythromycin by strain 958-2 (containing pNE24) was lower than for the erythromycin-susceptible, isogenic strain 958-1. No inactivation of erythromycin in overnight broth culture supernatants could be detected. In addition, no significant loss in binding affinity between [14C]erythromycin and ribosome could be detected for ribosomes isolated from strain 958-2 relative to 958-1, indicating that pNE24 probably does not produce a modification of the bacterial ribosome. No other selectable marker was found associated with pNE24; however, a 60,000-dalton protein was present only in the membrane fractions of cells (958-2) containing pNE24 and may play a role in mediating resistance to erythromycin.\r"

Prophylaxis was continued for 2 weeks. Diarrhea was defined as four unformed stools in 24 h plus an additional symptom of enteric disease. In the norfloxacin prophylaxis group, 4 of 56 subjects (7%) experienced diarrhea, compared with 36 of 59 subjects (61%) in the placebo group. The difference was significant (P less than 0.0001). In contrast to our previous experience with use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent traveler's diarrhea, quantitative stool cultures in the norfloxacin-treated group revealed a significant decline of normal aerobic fecal flora during prophylaxis (P less than 0.0005). Among stool samples from norfloxacin-treated subjects, 32 of 38 (84%) cultured on day 7 and 34 of 37 (92%) cultured on day 14 had no gram-negative bacilli. After norfloxacin was discontinued, fecal flora returned to pretreatment levels. No gram-negative aerobic flora resistant to norfloxacin were found during weekly quantitative cultures before, during, or after therapy.\r"

In a randomized, crossover study, we compared concentrations of mezlocillin in serum after a single dose and at steady state in 12 healthy volunteers who received 4 g every 6 h and 5 g every 8 h. A slight, but statistically significant, dose-dependent effect was observed upon the area under the concentration-time curve and total body clearance. No accumulation was observed with either schedule. Although concentrations in serum were higher after the 5-g dose, the more frequent administration of the 4-g dose schedule produced serum concentrations above the MIC for susceptible bacteria for a greater portion of the day. In the absence of clear guidelines from human studies which relate serum concentrations to clinical response, the available data indicate that the more frequent dosage schedule is appropriate for severe infections.\r"

Under anaerobic growth conditions the MICs were found to be even lower. The rough, DNA repair-deficient mutants of Salmonella typhimurium were more susceptible, whereas nitroreductase-deficient strains were resistant. Microaerophilic campylobacter isolates could be divided into two groups, one of which was as susceptible as aerobic bacteria (MIC50, 1 mg/liter) and the other of which was more highly susceptible (MIC50, 0.015 mg/liter). All anaerobic bacteria tested were susceptible to nitronaphthofurans (MIC50, 0.125 mg/liter). Nitrothiazole exerted antibacterial activities similar to those of the nitronaphthofurans. Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole derivative, and nitrofurans were definitely less active. Nitrobenzofurans showed relatively high MICs.\r"

The means of the individual peak levels for the 200-, 400-, and 600-mg groups were 2.17, 4.09, and 6.12 micrograms/ml, respectively. The mean respective terminal-phase half-lives were 20.6, 27.1, and 28.8 h; the mean half-life for all subjects was 25.7 h. Within the dose range studied, the behavior of difloxacin could be well described by a set of linear pharmacokinetic parameters with a one-compartment open model. Levels of unconjugated metabolites in plasma were negligible. The major urinary components were difloxacin and its glucuronide, each accounting for roughly 10% of the dose. Also present were the N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, accounting for 2 to 4%. Trace levels of other metabolites were observed. Group mean renal clearances ranged from 4.1 to 5.6 ml/min, indicating extensive reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate. As a result, the terminal phase half-life and the dose-normalized area under the curve were substantially greater than those of other members of the class.\r"

At dosage regimens that were not toxic for the host, xylotubercidin proved efficacious in various HSV-2 animal model infections. When applied topically at 0.25, 0.5, or 1% in dimethyl sulfoxide or when administered systemically (intraperitoneally) at 12.5 or 25 mg/kg per day, xylotubercidin suppressed the development of herpetic skin lesions and the paralysis and mortality associated therewith in hairless mice inoculated intracutaneously with HSV-2. In this model, acyclovir was effective only if administered topically at 5 or 10% in dimethyl sulfoxide. When administered intraperitoneally over a dosage range of 10 to 50 mg/kg per day, xylotubercidin achieved a significant reduction in the mortality rate of mice infected intraperitoneally with HSV-2. Under the same conditions, acyclovir did not offer any protection even when administered at doses up to 250 mg/kg per day. Xylotubercidin thus appears to have considerable potential for both topical and systemic treatment of HSV-2 infections.\r"

By using the rabbit model of enterococcal experimental endocarditis, animals were treated for 3 days with procaine penicillin (1.2 X 10(6) U intramuscularly three times daily) together with low-dose streptomycin (3.5 mg/kg) or high-dose streptomycin (10 mg/kg) intramuscularly three times daily. The peak concentrations of streptomycin in serum at 0.5 h were 9.2 and 26.8 micrograms/ml in the low- or high-dose group, respectively. When combined with procaine penicillin, both dosages of streptomycin were more effective (P less than 0.01) than procaine penicillin alone for the treatment of enterococcal experimental endocarditis. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of procaine penicillin plus low-dose streptomycin versus procaine penicillin plus high-dose streptomycin therapy of enterococcal experimental endocarditis.\r"

The passage of flucloxacillin to peripheral lymph and suction skin blisters was monitored. This drug was selected because the high serum protein binding of 96% offered a particularly good opportunity for the study of the impact on tissue penetration. Flucloxacillin was assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetics were assayed by computerized curve fitting to accepted models. Penetration of flucloxacillin to extravascular foci was rapid. After 30 min the drug concentrations were 0.5 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml in lymph and 0.9 +/- 0.7 microgram/ml in blister fluid. The peak concentration was 11.7 +/- 5.6 micrograms/ml in lymph and 4.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml in blister fluid. Concentrations in urine were above 111 +/- 50 micrograms/ml throughout the 8-h monitoring period, and urinary recovery was 60.4%. The half-life was 2.1 +/- 0.9 h in serum, 1.4 +/- 0.6 h in lymph, and 11.0 +/- 4.1 h in blister fluid. The differences in half-life were significant (P less than 0.05) between serum and blister fluid but not between lymph and serum. Penetration, as represented by the mean ratios of areas under the curve, was 19.7 +/- 8.1% to lymph and 38.2 +/- 11.7% to blister fluid. The flucloxacillin distribution volume during the phase of elimination was 36.4 +/- 16.0 liters and the total body clearance was 12.9 +/- 5.5 liters. Flucloxacillin showed good tissue penetration, considering its very high serum protein binding. High flucloxacillin levels in lymph and blister fluid were explained in part by drug affinity to extravascular albumin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The profile of total 14C in plasma was similar to that of the microbiological activity. The cumulative recovery of total 14C 5 days after drug administration averaged 76.3% of the administered dose in the urine and 8.7% in the feces. The residual dose remaining in the animal carcasses was 11.1%. Teicoplanin was widely distributed in the body. In almost all organs, the maximum concentration of [14C]teicoplanin was already reached at the first time of killing, which was 0.25 h after the administration of drug. The liver, kidneys, skin, and fat contained most of the residual dose found in the animal carcasses 120 h after administration and behaved as a deep compartment with the adrenal glands and spleen.\r"

  ".W": "19F nuclear magnetic resonance was used for a noninvasive and quantitative study of flucytosine (FC; 5-fluorocytosine) metabolism in two strains of Candida albicans and one strain of Candida tropicalis with various susceptibilities to FC. Three intracellular fluorinated metabolites were detected in the highly susceptible strain, F-nucleotides (Fnt), F-nucleosides, and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Fnt were partially converted into 5FU when the spectra of the yeasts were recorded at 37 degrees C without perfusion, but the intensities of the signals were not modified at 4 or 37 degrees C if the cells were perfused. In the acid extract, the Fnt signal was resolved into three distinct peaks; none of them was attributable to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. The same signals were detected in the partially resistant strain, but only 5FU was observed in the highly resistant strain; the resistance of the latter strain therefore was primarily due to a defect in UMP pyrophosphorylase. At the end of the incubation period, only FC and released 5FU were present in the culture media. The concentration of the intracellular fluorinated metabolites was increased if the strain was susceptible to FC. The total amount of metabolized FC was very similar for the highly susceptible and the partially resistant strains, but the percentage of Fnt was much higher in the former (38%) than in the latter (8%); the mild resistance of the partially resistant strain therefore was attributed to the decreased activity of UMP pyrophosphorylase.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro studies with penicillin and [3H]streptomycin in four strains of streptococci (S. faecalis, S. sanguis, and S. mitis) were performed by simultaneously measuring the rates of bacterial killing and uptake of streptomycin. In S. faecalis, penicillin stimulated streptomycin uptake, as has been shown by Moellering and Weinberg (R. C. Moellering, Jr., and A. N. Weinberg, J. Clin. Invest. 50:2580-2584, 1971). Moreover, the antibiotic combination was associated with an enhanced bactericidal rate which temporally correlated with beta-lactam-induced aminoglycoside uptake. In contrast, in viridans group streptococci (S. sanguis and S. mitis) penicillin had no effect on streptomycin uptake and a minimal effect on bactericidal rate when compared with either drug alone. These data suggested that the stimulation of streptomycin uptake in streptococci by penicillin is strain or species specific and that important differences exist between enterococci and viridans group streptococci regarding the mechanisms of beta-lactam-aminoglycoside potentiation.\r"

This question has been addressed by grafting 2-mm grafts of scalp from affected areas of seven patients with AA or alopecia universalis (AU) onto congenitally athymic (nude) mice. Hair growth in these grafts has been compared with that of 2-mm grafts from hair-bearing skin remnants from two individuals undergoing elective plastic surgical procedures. Because cyclosporine seems to directly affect hair growth, a group of grafted mice was treated with this agent. By day 48, hair growth was present in many surviving grafts. Cyclosporine affected hair growth; this was most prominent by day 78 when the number of hairs per graft and the mean length of hair had increased significantly over untreated groups. Grafts from patients with AU had more hairs per graft and had greater hair length than did similar grafts from patients with AA. These experiments show that hair growth ability in situ is likely normal in AA and AU, and that the factors causative to this disease in situ are mediated humorally. Furthermore, cyclosporine seems to directly influence hair growth in this model system.\r"

Minoxidil applied topically to one flank organ had no androgenic effect. Neither 1% nor 5% minoxidil topically applied for three weeks prevented the androgen-dependent growth of the pigmented spot, the sebaceous gland, or the hair follicle diameter induced by subcutaneous Silastic capsules filled with crystalline testosterone. As a positive control in the same experiments, 5% progesterone did significantly inhibit pigment and sebaceous gland enlargement. We conclude that there is no antiandrogenic component to the mechanism of action of topical minoxidil in the hamster flank organ, and thus there is probably no antiandrogenic role in man either.\r"

Routine newborn assessments, an examination for minor anomalies, the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment (NBAS), and part of the Graham/Rosenblith Behavioral Examination (G/R) were administered. Maternal and cord Pb-B correlated 0.80. In regression analyses, Apgar scores, birthweight, length, head circumference, neonatal anomalies, and seven behavioral scales were unrelated to either maternal or cord Pb-B. Three scales--the NBAS Abnormal Reflexes, the G/R Neurological Soft Sign, and the G/R Muscle Tonus Scales--were related minimally to either cord or maternal Pb-B. Because of the contrast in maternal and cord results, despite the high correlation of maternal and cord Pb-B, the data were reanalyzed for 132 cases with paired data. Only the Soft Sign Scale remained significant and that only for cord, but not maternal Pb-B. Regression analysis revealed a suppression with the Soft Sign Scale related to the variance of the cord Pb-B that was not common with maternal Pb-B. The possibility that the fetus under stress tends to accumulate Pb was considered.\r"

Exposures were separated by 1-wk periods and occurred in random order. Each lasted 1 hr and included three 10-min bouts of moderately heavy exercise (mean ventilation rate 41 L/min). Exposure temperature was near 22 degrees C and relative humidity near 50%. Specific airway resistance and maximal forced expiratory performance were measured preexposure, after the initial exercise, and near the end of exposure. Bronchial reactivity was assessed immediately following exposure, by normocapnic hyperventilation with subfreezing air. Symptoms were recorded on questionnaires before, during, and for 1-wk after each exposure. Exercise induced significant bronchoconstriction regardless of NO2 level. No statistically significant untoward response to NO2 was observed at any exposure concentration. This negative finding agrees with our previous results, but contrasts with findings elsewhere of respiratory dysfunction after exposure to 0.3 ppm. The discrepancy is presently unexplained, but it may relate to different severity of asthma in different subject groups.\r"

There were no significant differences in nodal status, presence of distant metastases, or the overall 5-year survival rate between these two sites. The 5-year survival rate for the entire group was 6%. Sixty-five patients (30%) underwent curative resection, and the 5-year survival rate in this group was 24%, which was significantly better than palliative procedures. The 5-year survival rate was strongly influenced by TNM stage, local invasiveness, nodal status, and presence or absence of distal metastases (p less than 0.001). Although the overall survival rate has not changed over the past 30 years, there were definite epidemiologic differences between proximal and antral lesions, which suggest that new treatment protocols should be designed to include the location of the neoplasm.\r"

No significant differences were found in the various age groups or with different types of dissemination. Patients with syncronous primary carcinoma and distant metastases had a high rate of regression as did patients with slow-growing carcinomas that metastasized many years after primary treatment. Estrogen receptor (ER) rates were good indicators of response only when determined on metastatic tissue at the time of oophorectomy. The value of ER determined on the primary tumor was of limited predictivity of response. A total of 220 patients received chemotherapy before oophorectomy. In this group the response rate was 22.3%, lower than that observed in patients who did not receive chemotherapy (36.6%). No important differences in total response rates were found among patients with amenorrhea and without amenorrhea although total regressions were more frequent in the latter patients than in the former patients.\r"

Major medical illness, preoperative shock, and longstanding perforation (more than 24 hours) correctly predicted the outcome in 93.8% of patients. Most importantly, 16 patients (6.2%) who died after operation could be identified (no false-negative error). The mortality rate increased progressively with increasing numbers of risk factors: 0%, 10%, 45.5%, and 100% in patients with none, one, two, and all three risk factors, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of patient selection and the feasibility of a risk grading system in guiding surgical management. Definitive surgery can be done safely in good-risk patients. Simple closure is preferable in those patients with uncomplicated perforations if any risk factor is present. Truncal vagotomy and drainage may be required if there is coexisting bleeding or stenosis. Nonoperative treatment deserves re-evaluation in patients with all three risk factors because of their uniformly dismal outcome after operation.\r"

Before gastrectomy, basal concentrations of CCK (13.4 +/- 2.3 pmol/L) rose significantly to a maximum of 23.3 +/- 3.6 pmol/L at 20 minutes after ingestion of oral fatty meal, and remained significantly elevated during the study. Gallbladder contraction began as CCK concentrations rose, demonstrating significant correlation with plasma CCK. One month after gastrectomy, CCK showed a rapid and greater response to the ingestion of fatty meal, attaining a maximum of 53.7 +/- 7.3 pmol/L at 10 minutes, then gradually falling to basal level. The maximal contraction of the gallbladder after gastrectomy was almost the same as before gastrectomy (62.7 +/- 4.0% of original area), showing a significant correlation with plasma CCK, but refilling of the gallbladder was induced earlier with corresponding reduction of plasma CCK. Simultaneous measurement of plasma concentrations of pancreatic polypeptide revealed a fairly similar response to plasma CCK before and after gastrectomy. The release of CCK is the chief mechanism by which the ingestion of a fatty meal causes contraction of the gallbladder even after gastrectomy as well as before gastrectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-eight hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma were performed on 94 patients from 1963-1985. HBs antigen was positive in 17% of patients, preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein was more than 20 ng/mL in 70% of patients, and liver cirrhosis was present in 75% of patients. Hospital mortality rate was 19%, and the volume of operative blood loss was the most decisive factor that affected the short-term prognosis. Excluding the 19 hospital deaths, the long-term survival rates of 75 patients were 73%, 42%, and 25% for 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Prognostic factors that influenced the long-term prognosis were investigated by comparing the survival curves. Significant differences of survival patterns were noted when analyzed on the basis of preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level (less than or equal to 200 vs. greater than 200 ng/mL), tumor size (less than or equal to 5 vs. greater than 5 cm), and tumor capsule. The recurrence of carcinoma was the main cause of death in 56% (42 patients) who died after discharge from the hospital. The development of effective prevention and treatment against recurrent tumors is necessary to improve long-term prognosis.\r"
