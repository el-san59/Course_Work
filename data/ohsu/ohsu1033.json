No significant difference was found in the amount of corneal scarring as graded by a masked observer. However, there was a trend toward deeper stromal damage in the drill-treated subjects (207 +/- 73 microns) than in the needle-treated subjects (172 +/- 61 microns). In light of this finding, we suggest caution in removing central rust rings with an electric drill since an avoidable, permanent scar may result.\r"

Transplants of embryonic substantia nigra correct some of the deficits found in experimental Parkinson's disease, for example, by mechanisms that are thought to include release of neurotransmitter and reinnervation of host targets, as well as by stimulating growth of host axons. Similar mechanisms appear to allow intraspinal transplants of embryonic brainstem to reverse locomotor and autonomic deficits due to experimental spinal cord injuries. Embryonic spinal cord transplants offer an additional strategy for correcting the deficits of spinal cord injury because, by replacing damaged populations of neurons, they may mediate the restoration of connections between host neurons. We have found that spinal cord transplants permit regrowth of adult host axons resulting in reconstitution of synaptic complexes within the transplant that in many respects resemble normal synapses. Transplants of fetal spinal cord may also contribute to behavioral recovery by rescuing axotomized host neurons that otherwise would have died. Electrophysiological and behavioral investigations of functional recovery after intraspinal transplantation are preliminary, and the role of transplants in the treatment of human spinal cord injury is uncertain. Transplants are contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms of recovery, however, and are likely to play a role in the development of rational treatments.\r"

We have established linkage between the disease phenotype \"lubag\" and DNA markers which span the Xp11.22-Xq21.3 region by using a large Filipino family with 8 affected men in three generations. These DNA markers define an interval of about 20 centimorgans in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome as the most likely site of the disease locus XDPD (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism). XDPD has a maximum multipoint log likelihood ratio score (Zmax) of about 4.6 over the interval from Xq12 to Xq21.31 (DXS159-DXYS1X). The co-occurrence of dystonia and parkinsonism in lubag and in other known disorders suggests there may be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Identification of the genetic defect in this family may provide an important clue toward understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both dystonia and parkinsonism.\r"

In this study, tests of localization accuracy were performed by using implanted dipolar sources in the human brain. These dipoles are created by passing a weak (subthreshold) current through intracerebral electrodes implanted in the brains of epileptic patients for seizure monitoring. The locations of these dipoles are accurately known from roentgenographs. First, 16 electroencephalograms produced by these dipoles were recorded, then inverse solutions were calculated for the apparent sources of these electroencephalograms. Finally, the locations of the apparent sources were compared with the known locations of the implanted dipoles to determine localization error. The average localization error for a total of 28 dipoles in 3 subjects was 1.1 cm. These results indicate that good localization accuracy for focal sources in the brain can be provided by scalp electroencephalograms.\r"

The inflammatory infiltrates, which contained numerous polymorphonuclear cells, were associated with mixed, axonal, and demyelinative lesions of nerve fibers. One of these patients improved on treatment with DHPG (9-[2-hydroxy-l(hydroxymethyl) ethoxymethyl] guanine) and remains stable after 18 months. The other 3 died soon after the onset of the neuropathy. In another patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, who developed a severe, predominantly motor neuropathy of the lower limbs, the nerve biopsy did not reveal cytomegalovirus inclusions, but the neurological deficit improved on treatment with DHPG. The patient died from cachexia 2 months later; numerous cytomegalovirus lesions were found in the spinal cord at the time of postmortem examination. The multifocal necrotic endoneurial nerve lesions with polymorphonuclear cell infiltration we describe may help identify cytomegalovirus neuropathy when characteristic inclusions are not present in the biopsy specimen.\r"

Results indicate that the highest risk of developing multiple sclerosis is seen in patients who are positive for oligoclonal IgM and IgG bands and who have disseminated cerebral white matter magnetic resonance imaging lesions at the initial presentation. Oligoclonal IgM bands predict progression to multiple sclerosis more frequently than oligoclonal IgG or magnetic resonance imaging alone. Our results confirm and further extend previous reports, and indicate that detection of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal IgM bands at presentation is a valuable prognostic indicator in patients presenting with acute isolated brainstem or spinal cord syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropathological studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells within the brain express several markers characteristic of macrophages and could either be microglial cells, or monocytes invading the CNS, or both. To better define the target cells of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 within the brain, we have studied human microglial cells, both in vivo and in vitro, and compared them to monocytes for their antigenic markers and their susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Brain-derived macrophages were isolated from primary cortical and spinal cord cultures obtained from 8 to 12-week-old human embryos. The isolated cells presented esterase activity, phagocyted zymosan particles, expressed several (Fc receptors, and CD68/Ki-M7 and CD11b/CR3 receptors) of the macrophagic antigenic markers, and appeared to be resident microglial cells from human embryonic brain. Conversely, brain-derived macrophages did not express antigens CD4, CD14, or CD68/Ki-M6, which are easily detected on freshly isolated monocytes. Using these antigenic differences between isolated microglial cells and monocytes, we have observed that two populations of macrophages could be individualized. In the normal adult brain, microglial cells were numerous in both the gray and the white matter. The infrequent cells sharing antigens with monocytes were found almost exclusively around vessels. In 8 to 12-week-old human embryos, microglial cells were found in both the parenchyma and the germinative layer. Cells sharing antigens with monocytes were only found at the top of and inside the germinative layer. In brain tissue from patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 encephalitis, cells sharing antigens with monocytes are abundant not only around the vessels but also in the parenchyma. In double-labeling experiments, human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells showed monocyte antigens. Finally, microglial cells also differ from monocytes in their in vitro susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection; after stimulation by r-TNF alpha or GmCSF, monocytes but not microglial cells can replicate human immunodeficiency virus type 1. This in vitro difference in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 susceptibility between monocytes and microglial cells together with the presence of monocytic antigens within the brain tissue of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients suggest that human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells within the brain are either monocytes that have crossed the blood-brain barrier and spread through the tissue or perivascular microglial cells that, after phagocyting infected blood lymphocytes, subsequently contain viral antigen and migrate to brain tissue.\r"

We studied the hippocampus of 6 patients with pathologically verified AD and 6 control subjects using a monoclonal antibody to glutamyl-glutamate and polyclonal antisera against glutaminase and taurine. In normal hippocampus, glutamate and glutaminase stained pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis (CA) fields and the subiculum, as well as the dentate granule cells. Fiber staining was better seen with glutamate antisera, which in AD specimens showed reduced numbers of glutamate-immunoreactive fibers in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. In AD specimens, glutamate- and glutaminase-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA fields were decreased in number and remaining neurons showed irregular shortened and disorganized dendritic fields. Taurine immunoreactivity was localized to a subset of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which showed similar degenerative changes in AD specimens. Glutamate-, glutaminase-, and taurine-stained neurons were found to contain neurofibrillary tangles using either double immunofluorescence with tau antisera, double immunoperoxidase stains, or silver and thioflavine S counterstains. These studies show that two distinct neurochemically defined populations of pyramidal neurons in allocortex frequently show degenerative changes and develop neurofibrillary tangles in AD.\r"

The genomic DNAs of the HLA-DRw53-positive patients and DRw53-positive controls were analyzed by using four complementary DNA probes for HLA class II genes. With DQB complementary DNA as the probe, a higher incidence of the 6.5-kb or 8.2-kb BamHI fragment was observed in the patients (76.0%) compared with the controls (19.0%). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between patients and controls when complementary DNAs for DRB, DQA, and DPB were used as probes. These results indicate that the genetic background of Japanese females with early-onset myasthenia gravis is different from other patients with myasthenia gravis, and that DQB genes can greatly influence the onset of myasthenia gravis.\r"

We studied 10 patients aged 22.5 +/- 6.0 years with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy selected because of a history of a prolonged childhood convulsion, which is characteristic of a group of patients in whom hippocampal sclerosis is a constant finding. All 10 patients showed reduction in size of one hippocampus associated with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. These changes were reliably detected on coronal spin-echo images, perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Appreciation of the normal imaging anatomy of the hippocampus allowed correct interpretation of the relative changes in signal intensities of the hippocampus and adjacent temporal horn on sequential echo images. The side of the abnormal hippocampus on magnetic resonance imaging accorded with the electroencephalographic localization in all 10 patients, and with the lateralization of the early convulsions in all 6 patients where this was known. Temporal lobectomy was performed in all 10 patients. Hippocampal sclerosis was confirmed in the 3 patients in whom hippocampal tissue was available for histological examination. The value of this technique was reinforced by the excellent postoperative results, with 80% being seizure free at a mean follow-up time of 33 +/- 4 months.\r"

Loss of heterozygosity for markers on the long arm of chromosome 22 has been reported in both instances, and neurofibromatosis type 2 has been genetically linked to a marker on the long arm of this autosome, suggesting that a unique locus on chromosome 22 is implicated in tumorigenesis of both sporadic and inherited acoustic neuromas. To determine whether the locus for neurofibromatosis type 2 might also be responsible for tumorigenesis of those schwannomas distinct from acoustic neuromas in people without neurofibromatosis type 2, we studied the DNA content of three sporadic spinal schwannomas. In all three, we found loss of heterozygosity for at least three markers on the long arm of chromosome 22, indicating a partial or total monosomy 22 in the tumor. Our results suggest that a locus on chromosome 22 is responsible for tumorigenesis in schwann cells regardless of their location in the central nervous system, and that some other mechanism (genetic or nongenetic) might account for the relative high proportion of schwannomas developing from the eighth cranial nerve.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of serum prolactin levels can be useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy, since prolactin levels often rise after seizures, but not after most imitators of epilepsy. Utility of the test is limited by the need to obtain blood 10 to 20 minutes after the episode. The present study documents the validity of prolactin measurements using capillary blood, which was obtained by the finger-stick method after a possible seizure and then applied to filter paper. Venous and capillary prolactin levels were determined 10 to 20 minutes after seizure-like episodes in 20 patients who were studied in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Venous and capillary prolactin values correlated, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.90. Using a criteria of any elevation above the laboratory upper limit of normal, capillary prolactin values correctly identified seizure versus pseudoseizure in 9 (100%) of 9 patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in 5 (71%) of 7 patients with complex partial seizures, and 4 (100%) of 4 patients with pseudoseizures. Prolactin values were unaffected by leaving filter paper samples at room temperature for up to 1 week. This study suggests the utility of diagnostic capillary blood collection kits to assist in the diagnosis of epilepsy in outpatients.\r"

Disability significantly increased immediately after trauma, but returned to baseline levels in subsequent weeks. These patients' signs deteriorated over the subsequent year, but this decline was equivalent to that of a matched control group with PD who did not have a motor vehicle accident or trauma. Based on these data, we conclude that trauma or stress caused by motor vehicle accidents can transiently exacerbate parkinsonian dysfunction without causing persistent increased disability or an alteration in disease course.\r"

The HTLV-I proviral DNA was 10- to 100-fold higher in the patients and in the HTLV-I carriers without HAM/TSP who had autoimmune or inflammatory diseases than in the carriers without autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The patients who had had onset of myelopathy at a younger age (15 to 39 years) had an extremely high level of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the early phase, as compared with findings in those with a late onset of myelopathy (at 44 to 61 years). The large increase in HTLV-I proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is presumably closely related to the development of autoimmune or inflammatory processes in HTLV-I carriers, including HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.\r"

  ".W": "Quinolinic acid is an \"excitotoxic\" metabolite and an agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who were neurologically normal or exhibited only equivocal and subclinical signs of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex, concentrations of quinolinic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were increased twofold in patients in the early stages of disease (Walter Reed stages 1 and 2) and averaged 3.8 times above normal in later-stage patients (Walter Reed stages 4 through 6). However, in patients with either clinically overt AIDS dementia complex, aseptic meningitis, opportunistic infections, or neoplasms, CSF levels were elevated over 20-fold and generally paralleled the severity of cognitive and motor dysfunction. CSF concentrations of quinolinic acid were significantly correlated to the severity of the neuropsychological deficits. After treatment of AIDS dementia complex with zidovudine and treatment of the opportunistic infections with specific antimicrobial therapies, CSF levels of quinolinic acid decreased in parallel with clinical neurological improvement. By analysis of the relationship between levels of quinolinic acid in the CSF and serum and integrity of the blood-brain barrier, as measured by the CSF:serum albumin ratio, it appears that CSF levels of quinolinic acid may be derived predominantly from intracerebral sources and perhaps from the serum. While quinolinic acid may be another \"marker\" of host- and virus-mediated events in the brain, the established excitotoxic effects of quinolinic acid and the magnitude of the increases in CSF levels of the acid raise the possibility that quinolinic acid plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of brain dysfunction associated with HIV-1 infection.\r"

To evaluate combinations of conservation techniques, 300 patients were divided into three equal groups. Group 1 had intraoperative autotransfusion and return of mediastinal drainage for 4 hours postoperatively. Group 2 had these measures plus intraoperative plasmapheresis. These two groups were given a transfusion for a hematocrit of less than 0.21 on cardiopulmonary bypass. Group 3 was treated with the same measures as group 2 but did not receive transfusions while on pump unless the hematocrit decreased to less than 0.15. The percentage of patients in each group given transfusions in the operating room was 34% in group 1, 28% in group 2, and 7% in group 3 (p less than 0.05). The percentage of all patients receiving transfusions during hospitalization was 68% in group 1, 36% in group 2 (p less than 0.05), and 18% in group 3 (p less than 0.05). Average total units transfused were 2.16 +/- 0.25 in group 1, 0.7 +/- 0.15 in group 2 (p less than 0.05), and 0.37 +/- 0.07 in group 3 (p less than 0.05). The perioperative morbidity rates including myocardial infarctions and strokes were similar. There were no deaths in group 3. Combining complementary conservation measures is effective in reducing homologous blood transfusions, and the need for transfusion can be safely reduced by allowing profound hemodilution during bypass.\r"

Five patients (10%) were operated on emergently for massive hemoptysis (1), Boerhaave's syndrome (1), or rapidly progressive respiratory insufficiency (3) with an operative mortality of 80%. Mortality for elective cases was significantly lower (13%, p less than 0.01). Major complications occurred in 19 patients (38%). Univariate analysis performed to identify predictors of operative mortality demonstrated no significant relationship between operative death and patient age, sex, type of operation, diagnosis of malignancy, or the presence of either cardiac disease or chronic obstructive lung disease. Twenty-three patients are alive 2 months to 5 years after thoracotomy.

Pretreatment characteristics were similar in the three groups. There was no procedure-related mortality. There were eight total complications related to the tube and none related to laser treatment (p = 0.02). Mean survival was 119 days in the AT group, 72 days in the AT/RT group, and 169 days in the L/RT arm (p = not significant). Quality of survival was most dependent on swallowing ability, and the swallowing score increased by 2.3 units in the AT group, 1.8 units in the AT/RT group, and 1.4 units in the L/RT group (p = not significant). Adding RT to laser therapy significantly increased time in treatment (mean, 38.7 days) when compared with the AT group (mean, 12.5 days) (p less than 0.001). However, only 1 patient required repeat laser ablation. It is concluded that AT and L/RT result in good palliation as measured by relief of dysphagia and survival time. However, morbidity of AT is significantly greater than that of L/RT. Laser and radiation therapy with a reduced total dosage of RT or with a change in fractionation schedule to limit treatment time is the preferred method of palliation.\r"

In the bubble oxygenator group, significant leukocyte and platelet right to left atrium gradients were found 15 minutes after lung reperfusion (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01) accompanied by a sharp increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration 5 minutes after lung reperfusion, whereas no significant right to left atrium gradient of leukocytes or platelets nor significant increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration was observed in the membrane oxygenator group. In both the bubble oxygenator and membrane oxygenator group, similar mild to moderate lung histological changes were found before lung reperfusion. After lung reperfusion, however, more endothelial cell swelling (p less than 0.05), leukocyte (p less than 0.01) and platelet (p less than 0.01) accumulation in lung capillaries, leakage of erythrocytes into the alveolar space (p less than 0.05), and type I cell damage (p less than 0.05) were found only in the bubble oxygenator group. Eventually, a significantly higher lung water content was found in the bubble oxygenator group than in the membrane oxygenator group (p less than 0.01) after cardiopulmonary bypass. This study indicated that lung injury during cardiopulmonary bypass starts mainly after lung reperfusion, which was correlated with lung leukocyte and platelet sequestration associated with different types of oxygenators.\r"

  ".W": "The fear of cerebral complications after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with heart disease and severe carotid artery disease has led many authors to suggest combined approaches in these patients. The pathogenetic mechanism for stroke is based partly on the stenotic narrowing of the carotid artery. A diameter reduction of 75% is frequently considered hemodynamically significant and indicative of an increased risk for neurological morbidity. We studied the cerebral blood flow in 7 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who also had severe bilateral carotid disease. The results were compared with the results in 17 patients without carotid disease who had bypass grafting. The cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia. Acid-base regulation was according to the alpha-stat theory, and blood pressure was kept greater than 50 mm Hg. The cerebral blood flow levels (mL.100g-1.min-1) before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in the study group (30 +/- 11, 31 +/- 8, 47 +/- 20) (mean +/- standard deviation) were almost identical to those in the control group (30 +/- 11, 28 +/- 8, 47 +/- 12). The cerebral blood flow levels for the left and right hemispheres in the group with carotid disease were comparable and within normal ranges. In 2 patients, slight differences were noted between hemispheres, and this finding may indicate an increased risk for ischemia. These patients, however, did not show any signs of postoperative deficit. The flow limitations of critical carotid stenoses do not seem to imply a risk for cerebral hypoperfusion if cardiopulmonary perfusion is performed in a controlled manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four hundred ninety-six had nonregurgitant trileaflet aortic valves before LVMM. In 19 (4%) of these patients, aortic regurgitation developed after LVMM. Age of the 19 patients ranged from 10 to 58 years (mean age, 35 +/- 3 [+/- standard error of the mean]]. Seven were male and 12, female. Five patients underwent LVMM followed immediately by aortic valve replacement or valvuloplasty. Aortic regurgitation developed in 14 patients at a later date. The average New York Heart Association functional class improved from 3.2 +/- 0.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05, Student's t test) after operation. The average peak systolic left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest and with provocation decreased from 65 +/- 8 to 14 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 108 +/- 9 to 45 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively, 6 to 8 months after operation. Aortic regurgitation occurred in 7 of the 14 patients at 6 months or less after operation, and 3 required operative repair. In the other 7 patients, aortic regurgitation developed 3 years or more after LVMM, and 3 of them also required operative repair. All 12 patients in whom aortic regurgitation developed at operation or within 6 months postoperatively had either a very small aortic annulus (less than or equal to 21 mm, 5 patients), a low mitral-septal contact lesion (greater than or equal to 35 mm below the aortic annulus, 3 patients), or both (4 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tricuspid valve endocarditis traditionally has been treated with either valve excision or valve replacement. To avoid implantation of foreign material in an infected field, we have applied the principles of mitral valve repair to 4 patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis. On preoperative echocardiography, all patients had 3 to 4+ tricuspid regurgitation, evidence of progressive right ventricular enlargement, and mobile vegetations. In each case, up to three quarters of the anterior leaflet was excised en bloc with infected chordae and papillary muscle heads. Surgical procedures included standard quadrangular resection, conversion to a bicuspid valve, and pericardial patch replacement of the anterior leaflet with mobilization of basal chordae to replace resected marginal chordae. On postoperative echocardiography, tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular dimensions were reduced in 2 of 4 patients in spite of loss of leaflet tissue. All excised valve tissue demonstrated bacteria on Gram stain or culture. Nonetheless, all repaired valves were successfully sterilized without recurrent infections. Tricuspid valve repair can allow eradication of infection with potential for improving valve competency in complicated tricuspid valve endocarditis.\r"

Cytology was performed three times: (1) at thoracotomy, (2) immediately after resection, and (3) after washing the pleural cavity with 5,000 mL of physiological saline solution just before closure of the chest wall. Twenty-three patients (14%) had more than one positive cytological finding. The frequency of positive cytological findings was significantly correlated with pathological T classification, pleural status, and pathological stage. The positive lavage group had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the negative lavage group in patients with stage I or stage II cancer. Four patients in the positive lavage group (17.4%) had recurrence in pleura or pericardium whereas only 1 patient in the negative lavage group (0.7%) had a recurrence in pericardium. The positive cytological finding of pleural lavage has more important meaning as a prognostic factor in stage I and stage II and indicates a greater possibility of recurrence in pleura or pericardium, but further examinations to evaluate the viability of detected malignant cells are required so that the positive cytological findings of pleural lavage can be regarded as subclinical pleural dissemination.\r"

The cardiorespiratory response to a 7.2% NaCl solution prepared in hydroxyethylstarch (HES) solution was investigated prospectively in patients undergoing prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (HS-HES group; n = 15); 6% HES 200/0.5 solution was infused in a control group (HES group; n = 15). Volume was given preoperatively to double low pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (less than 4 mm Hg) within 20 minutes. Hemodynamics, oxygen transport variables, and pulmonary gas exchange were studied before and after infusion as well as before and after CPB. Significantly less HS-HES solution (3.06 +/- 0.2 mL/kg) than 6% HES 200/0.5 solution (10.3 +/- 0.9 mL/kg) was necessary to double baseline pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Fluid balance during CPB was negative in the HS-HES patients (-0.05 mL/kg.min CPB) and was lowest in this group even 5 hours after CPB. Mean arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and heart rate were without differences between the groups. Changes in cardiac index (+40%) and total systemic resistance (-25%) were significantly most pronounced in the HS-HES patients, continuing even until the end of operation. Pulmonary gas exchange (arterial oxygen tension, intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting) was least compromised in these patients, particularly after bypass. Oxygen consumption was without difference between the groups; oxygen delivery increased significantly more in the HS-HES patients due to the larger increase in cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reports differ as to the efficacy of glucose and insulin as cardioplegic additives. Although deliberate oxygenation of crystalloid cardioplegic solutions improves myocardial protection, little is known about the protection afforded by glucose and insulin in such oxygenated solutions. In the isolated working rat heart, we studied the addition of oxygen, glucose, and insulin, separately and together, to a cardioplegic solution. The solution was equilibrated with O2 or N2, with glucose added as a substrate or sucrose as a nonmetabolizable osmotic control, with or without insulin. Hearts were arrested for 2 hours at 8 degrees C by multidose infusions. Oxygenation decreased lactate production and improved high-energy phosphate and glycogen preservation during arrest, prevented ischemic contracture, and improved functional recovery. The addition of glucose to the oxygenated solution increased the level of adenosine triphosphate at end-arrest from 10.5 +/- 0.5 to 13.9 +/- 0.6 nmol/mg dry weight and glycogen stores from 18.7 +/- 2.5 to 35.7 +/- 5.5 nmol/mg dry weight. The further addition of insulin did not better preserve these metabolites. Improvements in functional recovery due to glucose or insulin in the oxygenated solution attained statistical significance when both additives were included. Glucose increased lactate production significantly only when the solution was nitrogenated. Insulin added to the nitrogenated glucose-containing solution increased adenosine triphosphate and glycogen levels after 1 hour of arrest; and, although insulin did not prevent ischemic contracture from developing during the latter part of arrest with profound depletion of these metabolites, functional recovery was improved. The mechanism of improved functional recovery by insulin is not clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has recently gained some success in the diagnosis and management of interstitial lung disease. To assess the usefulness of BAL in differentiating between lung allograft rejection and infection, we examined the differences in cellular subsets of BAL and peripheral blood (PBL) samples in a controlled canine model of rejection or pneumonia. Single-lung allotransplants were allowed to undergo rejection by withdrawing immunosuppressive agents (n = 6). In another group of dogs (n = 5), pneumonia was induced by transbronchial injection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and melted agar followed by bronchial fulguration. Cells obtained from bronchoscopic BAL and PBL samples were labeled with functionally characterized cross-reactive murine monoclonal antibodies. Transthoracic needle biopsies and transbronchial biopsies were done to assess their adequacy in examining the rejecting or infected lungs and were compared with open lung biopsies. We found the following: (1) the percentage of DT2-labeled cells was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in BAL samples from rejecting lungs compared with infected lungs; (2) the PBL/BAL ratio of DT2-labeled cell percentages was significantly higher in pneumonia (1.7 +/- 0.3) than rejection (0.5 +/- 0.2) (p less than 0.004); (3) the percentage of E11-labeled cells in PBL samples was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) in rejection than in infection; and (4) the ratio of WIG4 to DT2 cellular subset percentages in BAL samples from rejection (26.8 +/- 9.9) was significantly lower than from infection (61.0 +/- 22.9) (p less than 0.03). Transthoracic and transbronchial biopsies did not always yield representative specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative steroid use has been considered a contraindication to heart-lung as well as lung transplantation. Moreover, most centers delay prednisone administration until 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively until airway healing is secure. We have performed 19 heart-lung transplantations and four single-lung transplantations since 1983. Five recipients (4 heart-lung, 1 single lung) had received prednisone, 5 to 40 mg daily, for 2 to 10 years preoperatively. All recipients were administered prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg daily, starting on postoperative day 1, with a taper to 0.2 mg/kg daily by 4 weeks. Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin (for 10 days), cyclosporine, and azathioprine were also employed. Bronchoscopy, lavage, and transbronchial biopsies were performed every 2 weeks for 3 months postoperatively. No patient had a serious airway complication; 2 heart-lung recipients, not on prednisone preoperatively, had a minor tracheal slough detected on bronchoscopy that resolved spontaneously. Actuarial survival after heart-lung transplantation is 84% +/- 8% and 69% +/- 16% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. We conclude that prednisone commencing at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg daily from the first postoperative day is a safe practice after heart-lung transplantation. The long-term use of low-dose prednisone before heart-lung transplantation does not preclude normal tracheal healing. The safety of prednisone before and immediately after single-lung transplantation awaits confirmation by further experience.\r"

This method seems to be superior to the conventional method, especially during the neonatal period.\r"

The National Institutes of Health group began implantation of this valve in 1970 and reported on the first 5 years of their results, which was one of the longest follow-ups of that valve at that particular time. Since then there have been a number of centers that have had long-term experience with thousands of these valves. In retrospect, it is now clear that some of the conclusions made by the National Institutes of Health group have not come to pass, such as this valve being the \"valve of choice\" for all patients. \"Valve of choice\" is a relative term and may be one valve for one patient and another valve for another patient. This report was important in bringing together some of the first medium-term data and pointing out that, even in this valve, there was some small degree of thromboembolism. The paper also provided a historical look at the methods of data analysis that were in use in the early 1970s compared with those now used in 1991. Actuarial curves were not yet commonly used, nor were percent/patient-year linearized results. Valve types were mixed as well. Hemodynamic data, always a strong point of National Institutes of Health data analysis, were excellent. The use of this valve became a fairly standard device and has been retrospectively analyzed by a number of centers, suggesting that now it is better used in the older patient or in patients who cannot take warfarin sodium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were seen with hoarseness, breathlessness, cough, stridor, wheezes, and tenderness over laryngotracheal cartilages. Respiratory tract involvement was confirmed by conventional radiography, tomography, computed tomography, dynamic pulmonary function tests, and bronchoscopy. Corticosteroids and antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agents were used in these patients. Tracheostomy was performed in 18 patients. Death occurred in 13 patients despite tracheostomy or corticosteroid therapy, or both. A detailed analysis of the clinical, radiological, and pulmonary function studies is presented, with emphasis on upper airway mechanics. The medical and surgical management options are reviewed, including the use of endotracheal prosthesis and extraluminal splinting in dynamic airway collapse.\r"

  ".W": "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Md, sponsored national telephone surveys of practicing physicians and the adult public in 1983, 1986, and 1990 to assess attitudes and practices regarding high serum cholesterol levels. Each time, approximately 1600 physicians and 4000 adults were interviewed. Trends show continuing change in medical practice and public health behavior relating to serum cholesterol. In 1990, physicians reported treating serum cholesterol at considerably lower levels than in 1986 and 1983. The median range of serum cholesterol at which diet therapy was initiated was 5.17 to 5.66 mmol/L (200 to 219 mg/dL) in 1990, down from 6.21 to 6.70 mmol/L (240 to 259 mg/dL) in 1986 and 6.72 to 7.21 mmol/L (260 to 279 mg/dL) in 1983. The median ranges for initiating drug therapy were 6.21 to 6.70 mmol/L (240 to 259 mg/dL) in 1990, 7.76 to 8.25 mmol/L (300 to 319 mg/dL) in 1986, and 8.79 to 9.28 mmol/L (340 to 359 mg/dL) in 1983. The number of adults who reported having had their cholesterol level checked rose from 35% to 46% to 65% in 1983, 1986, and 1990, respectively. Between 1983 and 1990, the number of adults reporting a physician diagnosis of high serum cholesterol increased from 7% to 16%; the number reporting a prescribed cholesterol-lowering diet increased from 3% to 9%. Reports of self-initiated diet efforts reached a high of 19% in 1986 and decreased to 15% in 1990 compared with 1% in earlier years. In 1990, over 90% of physicians reported awareness and use of the recommendations from the Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, and the public reported marked increases in awareness of dietary methods to lower serum cholesterol. These changes suggest educational gains; the data also suggest areas for continued cholesterol educational initiatives.\r"

  ".W": "Sublingual captopril (25 mg) was compared with sublingual nifedipine (10 mg) to determine their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. In nine of 10 patients who received sublingual captopril, mean (+/- SD) systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 245 +/- 39 to 190 +/- 25 mm Hg (P less than .0025) and from 144 +/- 8 to 115 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .001) at 50 minutes, respectively. The hypotensive effect of the drug was maintained for a mean of 4 hours. In six of nine responders to sublingual captopril, blood pressure-lowering effect was associated with a clear improvement of end-organ failure within 60 minutes. There were no side effects, including a dangerous fall in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia. Sublingual nifedipine lowered diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure in eight of 10 patients. The hypotensive effect of nifedipine was more rapid than that of captopril (10 vs 20 minutes for diastolic blood pressure and 20 vs 30 minutes for systolic blood pressure, respectively), but no difference was observed in the time or in the magnitude of peak hypotensive effect between the two treatments, nor was a difference observed in the duration of hypotensive effect. In six of eight responders to nifedipine therapy, a clear improvement of symptoms and signs of end-organ failure was observed within 60 minutes. In three patients, minor side effects were observed. We conclude that sublingual captopril effectively and safely lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with hypertensive emergencies.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging, when used as a part of the initial radiologic evaluation, detected abnormalities consistent with osteomyelitis in all 27 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated paravertebral and/or epidural extension of infection in 14 patients, including seven patients who had neurologic signs of lower-extremity weakness. Roentgenograms, computed tomograms, technetium bone scans, and gallium scans had findings suggestive of the diagnosis in 48%, 65%, 71%, and 86% of the patients, respectively. We recommend magnetic resonance imaging as an important and perhaps critical imaging modality for detection of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.\r"

More than one third of the physicians chose to initiate therapy without seeking a relevant history. Nearly half of all physicians indicated that a prescription would be the single most effective therapy; 65% recommended a histamine antagonist. By contrast, only 19% of nurse practitioners opted to treat without taking further history; the nurse sample asked an average of 2.6 questions vs 1.6 for physicians; only 20% of the nurses recommended a prescription medication. These findings raise concerns about the adequacy of basic history taking in this setting and the underuse of nonpharmacologic approaches in favor of excessive reliance on prescription drugs, even when not indicated by clinical circumstances.\r"

Further, we sought to determine how often therapy was changed as a result of roentgenographic findings. Overall, 41 (22%) of 187 chest roentgenograms obtained during initial febrile episodes, recurrent fevers, or persistent fevers were abnormal. While most patients had signs and symptoms suggesting the presence of pulmonary disease, 17% had roentgenographic abnormalities detected in the absence of such findings. During initial febrile episodes, therapy was not changed in response to findings on the chest roentgenogram. However, during episodes of persistent or recurrent fever, findings on chest roentgenograms led to changes in therapy in eight (61%) of 13 episodes of which six (40%) resulted in clinical improvement. Chest roentgenograms were therefore found to be an important diagnostic tool in evaluating recurrent or persistent fever in the neutropenic patient but of little use during initial febrile episodes.\r"

All patients were followed up for at least 6 months after starting zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Of the 86 patients, 78 (91%) initially received full-dosage zidovudine (1200 mg/d), and eight received a reduced dosage (600 mg/d). During follow-up, the number able to maintain full-dosage zidovudine therapy decreased to 54 (63%) at 3 months and 40 (47%) at 6 months. Thirty-five patients required dosage reductions that lasted at least 7 days and were not preceded by an adverse outcome (death or opportunistic infection). Overall, adverse outcomes occurred for nine (26%) of those with dosage reductions compared with 22 (43%) of 51 patients with no previous dosage change. Even after adjusting for baseline cytopenias and the time of the dosage reductions, adverse outcomes did not occur significantly more often in patients who received reductions in their zidovudine dosage. Our results indicate that full-dosage zidovudine therapy cannot be maintained for most patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, but that clinicians need not be pessimistic about treatment outcomes when dosage reductions are needed.\r"

Age, history of hypertension or coronary heart disease, history of cigarette smoking, presence of POAD, systolic blood pressure, and beta-thromboglobulin level were associated with progression of POAD. A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that the presence of diabetes mellitus or POAD or both at baseline, decreased postexercise ankle-brachial index, increased arm systolic blood pressure, and current smoking were independently associated with progression of POAD. This study suggests that cessation of smoking and control of hypertension are essential treatment modifications to decrease the risk of progression of peripheral vascular disease in diabetic patients.\r"

Among the five premenopausal patients, four had renal insufficiency and one had superactivity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase. More than 50% of the female patients had osteoarthritis, hypertension, or renal insufficiency or were treated with diuretics. Comparison with 220 male patients with gout showed that female patients developed gout significantly later, more frequently had associated diseases, and more often were receiving diuretics, whereas significantly more male than female patients had alcoholism. The articular features of gout were similar in both groups. However, the prevalence of tophi was higher and its localization different in female than in male patients. Female patients with gout had a higher mean serum urate concentration and a lower mean urinary uric acid excretion than did male patients with gout. These differences were significant and independent of the effects of age, renal insufficiency, alcoholism, or previous diuretic intake. Renal underexcretion of uric acid appears to be more severe in female than in male patients with gout.\r"

  ".W": "Despite its frequent clinical use in analgesic agents, caffeine has not been accepted unequivocally as an analgesic adjuvant. To evaluate this activity of caffeine, we used new study methods in a randomized controlled trial on patients with acute sore throat due to tonsillopharyngitis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of one of three treatments: 800 mg of aspirin with 64 mg of caffeine (n = 70), 800 mg of aspirin (n = 68), or placebo (n = 69). Under double-blind conditions, during a 2-hour evaluation period, patients used different rating scales to assess pain intensity, change in pain, relief, and two qualities of throat pain, how swollen the throat felt, and difficulty swallowing. Aspirin with caffeine and aspirin alone were significantly more effective than placebo for all efficacy measurements from 30 minutes through 2 hours and overall. The aspirin-caffeine combination also showed evidence of activity at 15 minutes on the relief scale. Aspirin with caffeine was more effective than aspirin alone after 30 minutes and over the entire study period. For patients with fever, both active treatments were equally effective antipyretic agents. We conclude, therefore, that 800 mg of aspirin, given alone or with 64 mg of caffeine, is an effective analgesic and antipyretic agent. Because the aspirin-caffeine combination is significantly more effective than aspirin alone as an analgesic, we also conclude that 64 mg of caffeine is an analgesic adjuvant.\r"

We recommend that a more humane and practical view be taken of middle-of-the-night gatekeeping requirements for physicians functioning in managed-care environments.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three study regimens that required daily application of two 15-cm2 patches: (1) 24-hour nicotine delivery, (2) nicotine delivery during wakeful hours only, and (3) placebo. The impact of the three regimens on smoking cessation rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms was examined. During the last 2 weeks of the trial, 39% of the 24-hour nicotine regimen delivery group, 35% of those on wakeful hour nicotine regimens, and 13.5% of the placebo treatment group achieved abstinence. Self-reported quit rates for the two nicotine patch-wearing regimens, as compared with that for the placebo group, continued to be significantly higher at 6 months. Moreover, compared with placebo, the transdermal nicotine patches significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms during the first few weeks of quitting. The differences in quit rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms between the two active groups were not statistically significant. The patches were well tolerated both topically and systemically. We concluded that transdermal nicotine, when used as an adjunct to low-intervention therapy, significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms and enhanced smoking cessation rates.\r"

We postulate that calcium excretion is sodium dependent and that hydroxyproline excretion is calcium dependent. Therefore, we sought to lower urinary hydroxyproline, which is a marker of bone resorption, by lowering urinary sodium. Fasting urine samples were obtained from 59 postmenopausal women before and after 2 to 7 days of dietary salt restriction. The urinary sodium-to-creatinine ratio fell from 16 to 7; calcium to creatinine, 0.30 to 0.26; and hydroxyproline to creatinine, 18.2 to 16.8. In the 28 subjects with starting sodium-to-creatinine ratios greater than 15, the hydroxyproline-to-creatinine ratio fell from 19.6 to 16.3. Salt restriction may be one way of reducing bone resorption in postmenopausal women, particularly in those whose sodium intake is high.\r"

Studies were repeated 3 to 4 weeks after controlled abstinence. There was no change in histologic findings during this period, indicating that alcohol itself was not the major causative agent. We then eliminated H pylori in 10 subjects by giving triple therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole). Treatment for H pylori was associated with almost complete normalization of histologic findings. Four control subjects who received antacids alone showed no improvement. Dyspeptic symptoms in H pylori-positive patients significantly improved after elimination of this organism, whereas there was no change with antacid treatment.\r"

Among 97 patients eligible for empirical antifungal therapy, 20 (21%) of these patients were ineligible for randomization to ketoconazole treatment because of their inability to tolerate oral medications. Among 72 patients eligible for randomization, 64 were assessable (32 in each arm of the study). Five of six patients with proved fungal infections who were randomized to receive ketoconazole treatment required crossover to amphotericin B treatment because of progressive infection. The conditions of three of these five patients improved after receiving amphotericin B. The frequency of transaminase elevation was higher in those receiving ketoconazole, while the frequency of azotemia was higher in those receiving amphotericin B. Bioavailability of ketoconazole was unpredictable. Amphotericin B remains the drug of choice for empirical antifungal therapy in granulocytopenic patients; whereas, lack of a parenteral formulation, ineffectiveness against proved mycoses, and unreliable bioavailability preclude high-dose ketoconazole from being an appropriate compound for this purpose.\r"

The taxonomy of this disorder is confusing and the many colorful pseudonyms should probably be dropped in favor of a simple classification based on the temperature of the water and the duration of exposure. When uncomplicated by infection or ischemic injury, immersion foot will quickly resolve with conservative measures only. More complicated cases may require antibiotics and surgical treatment. This syndrome may be exacerbated by disturbances of cognition, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, or the use of tobacco or vasoconstrictor drugs such as cocaine. A major contributing factor seems to be lack of shelter in the homeless population. Attention to foot care problems among the homeless and education concerning preventive measures are incumbent on physicians who care for the indigent.\r"

Although originally described in patients receiving neuroleptic drugs, this syndrome may also occur in patients with Parkinson's disease during withdrawal or reduction of levodopa therapy or other dopaminergic drug therapy. We have encountered three cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to withdrawal of levodopa therapy. These cases illustrate the variety of circumstances in which alteration of therapy with dopaminergic drugs can cause this syndrome and the relative unfamiliarity of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome-levodopa relationship among physicians who do not treat large numbers of patients with Parkinson's disease. An understanding of the role of brain dopamine in the pathogenesis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and an appreciation of the great variety of drugs whose manipulation can result in this potentially fatal syndrome will aid its proper and timely recognition, especially when the offending pharmacologic manipulation does not involve neuroleptic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-seven cases of acute leukemia and related entities were evaluated by morphologic examination, cytochemical study, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis, ultrastructural cytochemical study, and gene rearrangement analysis to determine the impact on the determination of the French-American-British (FAB) classification and the definitive diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis contained prognostic, diagnostic, and treatment information beyond the FAB classification that affected the disease course and patient management. All diagnostic variables were evaluated in each case and were labeled essential, ambivalent, supportive, or noncontributory. Except for gene rearrangement analysis, all variables we studied contributed essential data to establish the definitive diagnosis. Ambivalent findings were rare but could be explained with the knowledge of the total data. All variables, except cytochemical study, whose results were almost always essential, contributed supportive data. Noncontributory data only occurred with cytogenetic analysis in cases that demonstrated normal karyotypes. The FAB classification was established in 20 (74%) of the cases by use of morphologic examination, cytochemical study, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study. With use of the same variables, however, the definitive diagnosis, whose determination required all data, was established in only 15 (55.5%) of the cases. The addition of immunophenotyping increased the definitive diagnosis to 25 (92.5%) of the cases. The use of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase and platelet peroxidase analysis enabled us to definitively diagnose the remaining two cases (27 cases [100%]). Cytogenetic analysis revealed four cases in which essential information was added to the diagnosis. However, because the cytogenetic information usually was not immediately available, the result did not affect the immediate diagnosis or treatment. Surprisingly, the gene rearrangement studies did not yield essential data in any case and in a few cases contributed ambivalent data. This finding should not exclude gene rearrangement analysis in selected cases; however, the data should always be interpreted in light of all clinical and laboratory findings. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of a multifaceted approach to the understanding of the acute leukemias and related entities and shows the impact of newer technologies on reaching a definitive diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies have been recently developed that react with antigens expressed on T and B lymphocytes in routinely processed, paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissues. In this study, we assessed bone marrow clot and/or core biopsy sections of 19 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using routinely decalcified, B5- or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, including LN1, LN2, L26, Leu-22, UCHL-1, and LCA. Each case had been previously phenotyped using freshly obtained aspirate material and a standard immunophenotypic protocol. Our results demonstrate the utility of the LN2 antibody in differentiating between precursor B-cell (pre-B) and precursor T-cell ALL. The LN2 antibody stained 11 of 12 cases of pre-B ALL and did not react with any of the seven T-cell ALLs. The other antibodies tested were less helpful. The Leu-22 antibody stained both pre-B and T-cell ALLs, while the results with UCHL-1 revealed peculiar nuclear staining of pre-B and T-cell ALLs; this we attributed to processing artifact. The L26 antibody reacted with only one case of pre-B ALL (also CD20 antigen positive), while the LN1 antibody did not react with any pre-B ALLs. Neither L26 nor LN1 stained any cases of T-cell ALL. The LCA antibody stained in only four (21%) of 19 cases, two pre-B and two T-cell ALLs. The results also suggest that this panel of antibodies may be useful in differentiating ALL from mature B-cell and T-cell lymphomas involving the bone marrow.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain in the diagnosis of acute leukemia in light of the finer characterization of this disorder now available through immunophenotyping, we examined the blasts from 51 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia by morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic analyses. The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively. The sensitivity of a cytochemical-staining combination of PAS positivity and myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase negativity in defining cases of lymphoblastic leukemia remained at 52%; however, the specificity of this combination for lymphoblastic leukemia was 100% (no false positives). Thus, a positive PAS stain, in combination with negative myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase stains, continues to have a diagnostic role in the distinction between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia, and greater immunologic sophistication serves to support this position.\r"

Characteristic crystalline inclusions were present not only in myeloma cells but also in cornea, epithelial cells of glomeruli, tubuli, Bowman's capsules, and choroid plexus. Histiocytes had particularly infiltrated the renal interstitium. These inclusions were positive by immunofluorescence for kappa light and gamma heavy chains. By electron microscopy, the inclusions were filled with fine crystalline hexagonal columns, each possessing a core structure. Of various factors generally considered responsible for renal failure in multiple myeloma, marked infiltration of histiocytes and the nephrotoxic effects of light chain appeared most relevant in the present case.\r"

Accumulated experience has made clear, however, that this determination has distinct limitations. Consequently, the knowledge of the origin of hyperamylasemia may have an important influence on treatment, hospitalization, and extent of clinical investigations. We undertook a logical and systematic approach to the interpretation of hyperamylasemia through the use of an algorithm that can be applied in clinical situations without the need for the integration of radiologic procedures or clinical data. The proposed algorithm was tested for effectiveness in 97 consecutive hospitalized patients with hyperamylasemia (amylase level greater than twice the upper reference limit) for a 2-year period. The majority (52.5%) of these patients had acute pancreatitis. The algorithm assigned the correct diagnostic categories in 95.8% of cases, with a disagreement between patient diagnosis and algorithm-generated diagnosis in only four cases. These four patients (two with acute biliary disease, one with bacterial peritonitis, and one with chronic renal failure) had pancreatic lipase values greater than five times the upper reference limit, so that the algorithm classified their condition as acute pancreatitis. The clinical trial indicated that the proposed decision tree, which requires only knowledge of biochemical data that are readily available, is useful in the evaluation of elevated amylase activity and facilitates arrival at a definitive diagnosis.\r"

The overall autopsy incidence was 0.68%, within the range of previous reports. Forty-one cases (79%) were associated with malignant neoplasms; the remaining 11 cases were associated with miscellaneous disorders. Adenocarcinoma was associated with 27 (52%) of the cases. Unusual findings were the association of five cases with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and four cases with esophageal squamous carcinoma. This is explicable on the basis of a higher incidence of these two tumors in Hong Kong Chinese than in Western populations, ie, the source of most other reported series. Sex and age incidence, the distribution of infarcts, and the pattern of valve involvement were similar to those reported in other series of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\r"

An interstitial reaction for 5'-nucleotidase was associated with an inflammatory infiltrate in 19 of 21 positive cases. Of the 15 cases of polymyositis, 14 showed an extensive interstitial reaction surrounding most of the myofibers and extending well away from the areas infiltrated by inflammatory cells.

Marked round cell infiltration was observed in the noncancerous side of the capsule and around compressed hepatocytes near the capsule. Thin capsules were composed primarily of type III collagen produced by an increased number of fibroblasts, transitional Ito cells, and hepatocytes near the capsule. In thickened capsules, the noncancerous side consisted primarily of type III collagen and the cancerous side of types I and III collagen. Type I as well as type III collagen was produced by fibroblasts, transitional Ito cells, and hepatocytes. The capsule thus formed is suggested to be part of the defense mechanisms against the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

In most cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia, the ipsilateral lung was underdeveloped morphologically and biochemically compared with the contralateral lung. However, both ipsilateral and contralateral lungs were well developed in some cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia. Thus, acinar development of hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia is varied. The influence of other conditions, such as oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, and other anomalies that may influence retention of lung fluid or fetal respiratory movement, should be considered to assess the acinar development of hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia.\r"

The patients' ages ranged from 39 to 72 years (mean age, 54 years). Two patients had clinical stage I disease, one had stage II, 26 had stage III, and six had stage IV. Microscopically, the malignant cells formed large groups or sheets with desmoplastic stroma around them. Foci of papillary serous carcinoma, unclassified adenocarcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma were seen in 26 tumors, foci of necrosis were seen in 30 tumors, and vascular invasion was seen in seven tumors. Six of 13 carcinomas tested expressed CA125 reactivity, and 12 of 13 carcinomas reacted to B72.3 monoclonal antibody. The primary tumors were treated by aggressive surgical reduction in 32 patients and by multiple biopsy procedures in three patients. After the first operation, 30 patients had residual disease, smaller than 2 cm in five patients and larger than 2 cm in 23 patients. After surgery, 33 patients received chemotherapy; three of these 33 also received radiotherapy. One patient was treated with postsurgical radiotherapy only, and one patient refused further treatment. Thirty-four patients (97%) died of disease between 8 and 108 months (mean, 27 months) after initial surgery, 29 patients died in less than 32 months. Four patients (11%) survived more than 5 years: two patients with stage I disease who died at 82 and 102 months, one patient with stage II who died at 72 months, and one patient with stage III who has no evidence of disease after 116 months. Five-year survival of patients with undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma is worse than the reported survival of patients with serous carcinoma or ovarian carcinoma with a pattern resembling transitional cell carcinoma. The distinction between these three carcinomas that have solid areas carries prognostic significance.\r"

This lesion was characterized by the presence of global, diffuse, subepithelial, electron-lucent deposits, in addition to the usual features of transplant glomerulopathy. This unusual usual lesion, to the best of our knowledge, has been reported only once and, indeed, was recognized in only one of 297 renal allograft biopsy specimens in our file. Although the classification, pathogenesis, and origin of this rare lesion remain to be elucidated, it can be associated with nephrotic syndrome, deterioration of renal function, and eventual graft loss.\r"

To achieve this, we performed frozen section analyses with cryoprotected alcoholic Bouin's-fixed tissue, which permits evaluation within 2.5 hours. During a 30-month period, 200 allograft biopsies were performed; 68 frozen sections were obtained when deemed necessary by the clinical team. We compared frozen-section diagnoses with those following regular evaluation of the biopsy specimen. Agreement in diagnoses occurred in 61 (88.4%) of 69 specimens. Acute rejection was the dominant diagnosis (n = 39); others were acute tubular necrosis, cyclosporine toxicity, chronic rejection, and infection. Major misdiagnoses included acute vascular processes (three capillary and/or venous thromboses and one vascular inflammation); acute cellular rejection was missed in two cases, reflecting a sampling error. Secondary diagnoses not of immediate therapeutic importance were detected in seven frozen sections and missed in nine. These included chronic glomerulopathies, nephrosclerosis, and mild chronic rejection. Although acute vascular phenomena may be difficult to recognize in frozen sections, we conclude that allograft biopsy frozen-section analysis is a valuable part of the care of transplant recipients.\r"

Recently, definitions of myocarditis have been proposed and precise criteria for the morphologic recognition of myocarditis have been published. In this study an analysis of 12,747 consecutive autopsies performed from 1975 to 1984 at Malmo (Sweden) General Hospital was carried out. Applying the newly proposed histologic criteria, the diagnosis of myocarditis was made in 136 cases, which constitute 1.06% of the autopsy population studied. This rate of myocarditis incidence at postmortem is lower by far than rates previously published.\r"

The smears showed a dimorphic population of epithelial cells and lymphocytes, characteristic of thymoma. The resemblance of the cytologic pattern to the primary neoplasm and positive reactivity with various immunohistochemical agents peculiar to thymomas confirmed the diagnosis. Aspiration cytology has been described in the diagnosis of primary thymoma. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of a cytologic diagnosis of metastatic thymoma and the first one with immunohistochemical studies.\r"

  ".U": "91189934\r", 
  ".W": "In animal models of parkinsonism, the ability to lose a substantial proportion of dopaminergic neurons without behavioral deficits does not derive from other systems taking over function of the dopaminergic pathway. The surviving nigrostriatal projection increases both the rate of synthesis and the release of dopamine, as compensatory adjustments. This capacity allows at least a fivefold rise in dopamine delivery per neuron, and this enhancement is potentiated further by receptor up-regulation. Decreased reuptake, due to loss of nerve endings, may also lead to augmented occupancy of dopamine receptors, and so constitute yet another compensatory mechanism. In humans, positron emission tomography has revealed subclinical impairment of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in subjects at risk for parkinsonism caused by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and Lytico-Bodig (the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam). However, the separation of patients with clinically overt idiopathic parkinsonism from controls is less marked in vivo (by positron emission tomography) than in postmortem analysis (by neurochemical assay). This disparity may be attributable to the reduction in the number of nigrostriatal nerve endings, leading, in vivo, to a relative increase of extracellular dopamine because active reuptake into the nerve endings is an important mechanism for removing dopamine from the synaptic cleft. In contrast, in a postmortem setting, dopamine that is not sequestered in the storage vesicles of nerve endings is readily available for biochemical degradation during the interval between death and brain analysis. Finally, it is also possible that differences may derive, in part, from dissimilar kinetic systems for handling exogenous and endogenous levodopa.\r"

The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients. One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients.

  ".W": "Experimental studies in rodents show that beta-nerve growth factor can increase the survival, neurite outgrowth, and functional effect of grafts of adrenal chromaffin cells to the basal ganglia. We, therefore, have begun to investigate whether treatment with nerve growth factor might also increase the functional effect of autografts of adrenal medullary tissue in patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have shown that stereotactic implantation of adrenal tissue pieces produces a transient functional improvement that lasts for a few months. This report describes a trial of grafting of adrenal chromaffin tissue into the putamen, supported by infusion of nerve growth factor. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a 19-year history of Parkinson's disease, now complicated by on-off phenomena and drug-induced hyperkinesia, despite optimized medical management. The left adrenal gland was removed, and the medulla was dissected into 1- to 2-mm3 pieces in a solution containing nerve growth factor purified from mouse submandibular gland. Pieces were implanted in six tracts 3 to 4 mm from a previously placed cannula in the left putamen. Through the cannula, nerve growth factor was infused for 23 days for a total dose of 3.3 mg. Clinical assessment consisted of global ratings for rigidity and/or hypokinesia and for drug-induced hyperkinesia. Measures of gait and fine-motor control were also made. The motor readiness potential and auditory evoked potentials were recorded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prednisone at 0.3 mg/kg (n = 33), prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg (n = 34), and placebo (n = 32) were administered for 6 months. Patients were examined using manual muscle and myometry testing, timed functional testing, pulmonary function testing, and laboratory measurements at 10 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months of treatment. Boys treated with prednisone had stronger average muscle strength scores, than did boys treated with placebo as early as 10 days after starting therapy. At the 3-month visit, the boys in the group given 0.75 mg/kg of prednisone were significantly stronger than those in the group given 0.3 mg/kg of prednisone, indicating a dose response. At 6 months, significant side effects occurred in the group treated with 0.75 mg/kg of prednisone, including weight gain, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hari growth. Only weight gain was observed in the group taking prednisone at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Importantly, no side effects were evident at 10 days or 1 month of treatment, despite improvement in muscle strength and function. We conclude that prednisone produces a rapid increase in muscle strength in patients with Duchenne dystrophy and that this improvement is maximal at a prednisone dosage of 0.75 mg/kg or less.\r"

Obese women with chronic daily headache and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, pulsatile tinnitus, history of head trauma or meningitis, an empty sella on imaging studies, or a headache that is unrelieved by standard therapy should have a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Findings from laboratory and neurologic investigations are normal in most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. Initial management should include removal of possible inciting agents, weight loss if applicable, and standard headache therapy. Lumbar puncture and diuretic therapy should precede a trial of corticosteroids. Surgery (lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt or perhaps optic nerve sheath fenestration) may be indicated for prolonged incapacitating headache that is not responsive to medical management or lumbar puncture.\r"

The other five patients continued to receive standard Sinemet. To maintain the same degree of control of PD in the five patients switched to the controlled-release form of Sinemet, the daily levodopa intake increased. While receiving optimal therapy (standard Sinemet or controlled-release Sinemet) and a protein redistribution diet, all 10 patients then underwent hourly videotaping and blood sampling (for plasma levodopa levels) during 2 consecutive days. Videotapes were blindly reviewed for PD disability, dyskinesia, and the time required to walk a measured distance. Comparing the two groups, standard Sinemet with controlled-release Sinemet, respectively, mean levodopa requirements were 505 and 1895 mg, plasma levodopa levels were 6.1 and 17.6 mumol/L, and abnormal involuntary movement scale scores were 14 and 26. Their mean PD disability scores did not differ statistically or clinically. Also no statistically significant differences were noted in either their mean walking times or their mean daily dose frequencies.\r"

During the same 8-year interval, approximately 587 adults were seen at the center for a brain tumor, 90% of whom received ongoing therapy. Therefore, in at least 1.7% (10/587) of our patients with brain tumors, P carinii pneumonia developed. The median duration of dexamethasone therapy at the onset of P carinii pneumonia symptoms was 2.75 months. Symptoms began during tapering of steroid therapy in eight episodes. Bronchoscopy was diagnostic in the eight cases in which it was performed. Four episodes (40%) were fatal. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis may be indicated in some patients with brain tumors, especially during tapering of steroid therapy.\r"

In the entire group, the frontal half of the horizontal brain section showed asymmetry, with the right side being larger, whereas posteriorly only the occipital polar segment was asymmetrical, with the left side being larger. Dyslexic subjects exhibited asymmetry, with the right side greater than the left side, in contrast to the relatively symmetrical pattern that is normally observed in the midposterior segment that corresponds to the angular gyrus. In the corpus callosum, dyslexic subjects were found to have a larger splenium than nondyslexic subjects, and dyslexic female subjects were found to have a larger splenium than dyslexic male subjects. Because transcallosal pathways connecting the left and right angular gyrus regions traverse through the splenium of the corpus callosum, the above findings in dyslexic subjects suggest an anatomic abnormality in the angular gyrus region.\r"

Irrespective of drug treatment, hypertensive individuals performed significantly worse than did control subjects when assessed for verbal memory and total learning and memory capacity, while there were no differences in test results of visual memory, attention, vigilance, and reaction time. The hypertensive individuals also described themselves as less active but ranked similar on five other mood subscales. Punctate high-signal intensities of the white matter were found almost twice as often in the hypertensive group (38%) as in the control group (20%). There was no difference in test performance between hypertensive individuals with and those without white matter lesions, however. Our results confirm the presence of subtle neuropsychologic deficits and indicate a higher frequency of white matter signal abnormalities in essential hypertension, as shown on magnetic resonance imaging, but do not indicate a correlation of these findings with each other.\r"

Pathologic conditions included anterior stromal and superficial scarring from postinfectious and posttraumatic causes, including inactive herpes simplex virus, anterior corneal dystrophies, recurrent erosions, granular dystrophy, and band keratopathy. Most patients received peribulbar anesthesia and underwent removal of the epithelium prior to laser ablation. A majority of patients had a reduction in the amount of corneal scarring and approximately half had improved visual acuity. No intraocular reaction or changes in endothelial counts were seen, and some patients avoided the need for penetrating keratoplasty. Reepithelialization usually occurred within 4 or 5 days and we noted no significant scarring secondary to use of the laser. It was difficult to eliminate preexisting irregular astigmatism despite the use of surface modulators, such as methylcellulose. A hyperopic shift secondary to corneal flattening was encountered in approximately 50% of the patients. A combination of myopic ablation, followed immediately by a secondary hyperopic steepening, may minimize this refractive change. The 193-nm excimer laser is an effective new tool in the treatment of selected patients with superficial corneal opacity from a variety of conditions.\r"

Compared with findings for a normal control population, these epikeratoplasty patients were found to have statistically significant contrast sensitivity losses. To evaluate the clinical relevance of these losses, the results were also compared with those for two other patient groups with abnormal corneal optics, seven radial keratotomy patients and seven keratoconus patients wearing rigid contact lenses. Contrast thresholds for the epikeratoplasty and keratoconus patients were similar and usually statistically indistinguishable, and their losses were far more profound than those of the radial keratotomy patients. The addition of glare did not alter this pattern of losses. The results document the extent of vision losses in these patients and suggest that increased intraocular light scattering is not a major contributor to the observed contrast sensitivity decrements.\r"

Predisposing factors included extended-wear soft contact lens use in one patient and exposure secondary to Bell's palsy in another patient. All three patients had neutropenia that may have contributed to their poor response to treatment. Enucleation was required to treat two patients with overwhelming infection. Enucleation has been rarely required for treatment of corneoscleritis in immunocompetent patients treated at our institution. Pseudomonas keratitis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients represents a serious ocular infection requiring early diagnosis and aggressive treatment.\r"

Asymmetry of power (1.5 or more diopters) between these two major hemimeridians was also observed in three patients. Relaxing incisions were placed in the two steep hemimeridians and compression sutures were placed in the flat hemimeridians. The mean percent of reduction of astigmatism (vector-corrected) was 81.1%. The amount of keratometric astigmatism, and the degree of asymmetry of the hemimeridians were not correlated with the percent of reduction of astigmatism after placement of the relaxing and compression sutures. Computer-assisted topographic analysis may prove useful in planning transverse keratotomies centered on the steep hemimeridians and in placement of compression sutures in flat hemimeridians.\r"

Late-onset elevation in intraocular pressure was seen in three eyes (1.4%) after cataract surgery alone (mean follow-up, 2.7 +/- 1.7 years) and in 14 eyes (5.9%) after cataract and laser surgeries (mean follow-up, 3.0 +/- 1.1 years). This difference was statistically significant (P less than .03). These results suggest that, in addition to immediate changes in intraocular pressure, neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy may be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure long after the laser surgery, even in normal eyes without obvious postoperative complications.\r"

Endocapsular hematoma differs from anterior chamber hyphema in several ways: the location of the blood is in the endocapsular space, a small amount of endocapsular blood can cause visually disabling symptoms, the blood in the endocapsular space often fails to reabsorb, and neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy can be used to drain the endocapsular blood into the vitreous cavity. We present six cases of endocapsular hematoma. Neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy was successfully used to drain the endocapsular hematoma in three of these cases.\r"

The interval between enucleation and the interview varied between 2 and 25 years. Eighty-seven percent (62/71) reported no change in their ability to perform these important vision-dependent tasks. At 15 years after enucleation, 90% (18/20) retained the ability to drive and 96% (25/26) retained the ability to read. These results are reassuring for those with choroidal melanoma who are faced with enucleation, because most of these patients seem likely to continue at a level of visual function comparable with their preenucleation status.\r"

With this technique, one patient with a traumatic carotid cavernous sinus fistula and two patients with spontaneous dural cavernous arteriovenous malformations were evaluated. Color Doppler imaging demonstrated a dilated superior ophthalmic vein with arterialized blood flow in all three patients. In two cases the diagnosis was confirmed by angiography, and in one of these cases the fistula was occluded with a detachable balloon catheter. Postembolization color Doppler imaging revealed return of normal venous flow in the superior ophthalmic vein. This technique offers a noninvasive means to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to track the hemodynamics of these arteriovenous fistulas. In certain cases, color Doppler imaging may eliminate the need for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of suspected arteriovenous malformations of the orbit.\r"

  ".W": "Although free radical formation and lipid peroxidation have been implicated in photoreceptor degeneration following continuous light exposure, recent evidence led us to hypothesize that excessive stimulation of the photoreceptor cells in prolonged light exposure may cause intracellular calcium overload and consequent photoreceptor cell injury. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of flunarizine hydrochloride, a calcium overload blocker that inhibits the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-induced release of intracellular stores of calcium, in an established rat model of light-induced retinal degeneration. Light and electron microscopic examination of the flunarizine-treated retinas revealed remarkable preservation of the retinal pigment epithelium, rod inner and outer segments, nuclei, and synapses of the photoreceptor cells at all phases of the recovery period. This observation was further supported by morphometric evaluation of the outer nuclear layer thickness, which revealed a greater preservation of the photoreceptor nuclei in the drug-treated animals at 6 and 14 days after exposure. In addition, the rhodopsin levels in the flunarizine-treated retinas were also significantly higher than in the controls in all phases of recovery. The ability of flunarizine to ameliorate light-induced retinal degeneration in the rat supports our hypothesis that elevated intracellular calcium may indeed play a role in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "The structure and distribution of pseudoexfoliation material in extrabulbar tissues from five eyes with typical unilateral intraocular pseudoexfoliation syndrome and two intraocularly unaffected fellow eyes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. In all seven eyes, unevenly distributed pseudoexfoliation aggregates were found in limbal conjunctivae, extraocular rectus and oblique muscles, orbital connective-tissue septa, and the walls of the posterior ciliary arteries, vortex veins, and central retinal vessels passing through the optic nerve sheaths. Typical pseudoexfoliation fibers occurred in close association with connective-tissue components, especially elastic fibers; a moderate predisposition of pseudoexfoliation clumps to accumulate around blood vessels was observed. The findings of pseudoexfoliation material in similar extrabulbar locations in intraocularly uninvolved fellow eyes indicates that pseudoexfoliation fiber formation outside the globe precedes its intraocular manifestation. The intermingling of pseudoexfoliation fibers, microfibrils, and elastic and collagen fibers suggests that pseudoexfoliation fiber formation might result from a disordered synthesis and/or assembly of connective-tissue microfibrils.\r"

The variables studied were slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment, intraocular pressure as measured by pneumotonometry, corneal thickness and endothelial cell count as measured by specular microscopy, lens opacity by Scheimpflug photography, and light and transmission electron microscopy. All three gases were more toxic to the cornea and lens than were balanced salt solution, hyaluronate, and aqueous humor. However, 15% perfluoropropane and 50% sulfur hexafluoride were no more toxic to the eye than air was. Therefore, this study suggests that nonexpansile mixtures of perfluoropropane and sulfur hexafluoride may be beneficial and relatively safe in re-forming persistently flat anterior chambers in situations where the use of air is being considered.\r"

Retinal pigment epithelial cells incubated in a macrophage-conditioned medium assumed fibrocytelike morphologic characteristics, grew faster, and exhibited a decreased cellular release of fibrillar and nonfibrillar matrix components. However, due to a simultaneous greater increase in cell numbers in these modulated cultures, the total production of fibrillar and nonfibrillar matrix components by the culture population was increased.\r"

The majority of these patients had radiographic findings of mild osteoarthritis. Twenty-five (33%) of the 76 patients in the series whose radiographs showed tibiofemoral JSN had grossly normal articular cartilage in both tibiofemoral compartments at arthroscopy (false-positive). The specificity of medial JSN for the presence of medial compartment articular cartilage degeneration was 0.61, i.e., only 61% of patients with normal (grade 0) medial compartment cartilage had a normal medial joint space. Of 22 patients with greater than 50% medial JSN, 9 (41%) had normal articular cartilage in the medial compartment at arthroscopy. Of 6 patients with greater than 50% lateral JSN, 3 (50%) had normal lateral compartment articular cartilage at arthroscopy. Among 36 patients with greater than 25% JSN who had neither medial nor lateral compartment articular cartilage degeneration, JSN was associated with articular cartilage degeneration in the patellofemoral compartment in 8 (22%), with meniscus degeneration in 18 (50%), and with both in 8 (22%). Thus, in these patients with chronic knee pain, radiographic evidence of JSN in the tibiofemoral compartment did not permit confident prediction of the status of the articular cartilage.\r"

By Student's tau-test, the mean serum KS concentrations in OA and RA patients measured with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) 5-D-4 and 2-D-3 were significantly increased over those in the PFS and normal groups; similar findings were observed using a nonparametric test, except that levels in RA patients showed no difference from those in PFS patients and normal subjects. There was no significant correlation between joint scores or disease duration and KS levels in OA or RA patients. Gel filtration of sera revealed mainly large, polydisperse KS-bearing fragments which eluted in a broad profile. KS purified from sera by immunoaffinity chromatography consisted mainly of high-density proteoglycans. Electrophoresis of pooled high-density KS fractions in polyacrylamide-agarose gels followed by Western blotting with MAb 5-D-4 showed diffuse bands with relative mobilities corresponding to large proteoglycans. These findings are consistent with attachment of KS to protein core fragments of various sizes; KS in patient sera is comparable in size with that in normal sera. Elevations of serum KS levels occur in the presence of cartilage degradation, but do not quantitatively define the extent or duration of articular involvement.\r"

By far, the strongest T cell stimulation was induced by incubation with autologous serum; there was a significantly lower response or no response after incubation with allogeneic or heterologous sera. In patients with Lyme borreliosis, including seronegative patients, there was a strikingly elevated proliferation in response to whole B burgdorferi bacteria (mean 64,750 dpm) compared with that of normal donors (mean 19,700 dpm; P less than 0.0001) and especially that of non-Lyme arthritis patients (mean 11,600 dpm; P less than 0.0001). Levels of proliferation declined significantly in patients with Lyme borreliosis after successful antibiotic treatment. Parallel cultures using B burgdorferi and Treponema phagedenis as antigens showed that cells from patients with Lyme borreliosis responded significantly more to B burgdorferi than to T phagedenis, but this did not occur with cells from individuals with non-Lyme arthritides. There was no correlation between disease stages and proliferation values. These data indicate that lymphocyte proliferation assays may provide an important tool for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, most notably in patients with arthritides and in those who are seronegative. Conversely, the lack of reactivity appears to be a strong indicator of the absence of active Lyme disease. It seems to be crucial, however, to use autologous sera in these assays.\r"

The patients had increased bronchoalveolar levels of ECP, which correlated with impaired lung functioning. Skin infiltration with activated eosinophils and extracellular deposits of ECP were present in skin biopsy samples from the SSc patients. We conclude that eosinophil activation is part of the inflammatory process in SSc.\r"

In SLE patients, a decreased number of erythrocyte complement receptor type 1 was associated with less binding of 123I-AHIgG to erythrocytes and a faster initial rate of elimination of 123I-AHIgG (mean +/- SEM half-maximal clearance time 5.23 +/- 0.2 minutes, versus 6.58 +/- 0.2 minutes in the controls), with possible spillover of the material outside the mononuclear phagocyte system of the liver and spleen. However, multiple regression analysis showed that serum concentrations of IgG were the most important factor predicting the rate of 123I-AHIgG elimination. IgG concentration may thus reflect immune complex clearance, which in turn, would influence the inflammatory reaction, in SLE.\r"

In vitro studies performed at our laboratory and others have demonstrated that resting human B cells bind microbial superantigens and present them to superantigen-reactive autologous T helper cells, resulting in T cell activation and polyclonal IgM and IgG production by the superantigen-bearing B cells. In vitro studies of microbial superantigen-mediated murine T helper-B cell interactions demonstrate preferential help for B cells that have encountered specific antigen. Both in humans and in mice, the cellular interactions involved and the B cell responses induced are highly analogous to those mediated by allospecific T helper-B cell interaction. Finally, the results of studies carried out on T cell-deficient (nude) mice suggest that microbial superantigens may trigger similar T helper cell-dependent polyclonal IgM and IgG responses in vivo. These mice will be studied over time and tested for the development of autoantibodies characteristic of SLE and of autoimmune organ system damage, the occurrence of which are predicted by our model.\r"

The effects of CSA on renal eicosanoid excretion in rheumatoid arthritis were studied over a 24-week period, during which treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was discontinued. The initial dosage of CSA was 4 mg/kg/day; at week 24, the mean dosage of CSA was 3.9 mg/kg/day. At week 24, the mean (+/- SD) serum creatinine level (1.04 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) was 32% above the baseline value; renal blood flow had decreased by 21% (P less than 0.03) and the glomerular filtration rate had decreased by 16%. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.03) in the 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 level at week 2, but there was no significant change in the levels of the other eicosanoids. This study demonstrates that after CSA treatment, there is a selective increase in a thromboxane metabolite that parallels an increase in renal vascular resistance, even in the absence of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and with unimpaired formation of other vasodilator eicosanoids.\r"

  ".U": "91055161\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To determine whether measurement of total cholesterol concentration is sufficient to identify most patients at lipoprotein mediated risk of coronary heart disease without measurement of triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. DESIGN--Cross sectional screening programme. SETTING--Six general practices in Oxfordshire. PATIENTS--1901 Men and 2068 women aged 25-59. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Cardiovascular risk as assessed by fasting venous plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol. RESULTS--2931 Patients (74% of those screened) had a total cholesterol concentration of less than 6.5 mmol/l. If the triglyceride concentration had not been measured in these patients isolated hypertriglyceridaemia (greater than or equal to 2.3 mmol/l) would have remained undetected in 185. Among these 185 patients, however, 123 were overweight or obese and only 18 (0.6% of those screened) had an increased risk associated with both a raised triglyceride concentration (greater than or equal to 2.3 mmol/l) and a low HDL cholesterol concentration (less than 0.9 mmol/l). Conversely, in the 790 patients with predominant hypercholesterolaemia (cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/l and triglyceride concentration less than 2.3 mmol/l) measurement of HDL cholesterol concentration showed that 348 (9% of those screened) had only a moderately increased risk with a ratio of total to HDL cholesterol of less than 4.5 and 104 had a low risk with a ratio of less than 3.5. CONCLUSIONS--Fasting triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations identify few patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease if the total cholesterol concentration is less than 6.5 mmol/l. HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations should, however, be measured in patients with a total cholesterol concentration exceeding this value. Total cholesterol concentration alone may overestimate risk in a considerable number of these patients, and measurement of HDL cholesterol concentration allows a more precise estimate of risk. Measurement of the triglyceride concentration is required to characterise the lipoprotein abnormality. A patient should not be started on a drug that lowers lipid concentrations without having had a full lipoprotein assessment including measurement of HDL cholesterol concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and eighty four patients with Down Syndrome (DS) were seen between 1951-1989. One-hundred and fourteen (40.1%) had a [corrected] cardiac murmur at presentation. A definitive cardiac diagnosis was established in 47 (41%) patients, of which 38 had long term follow-up. Fifteen (33%) patients had atrioventricular canals. There were 21 males and 17 females, with a mean age of 5.3 years. Fifteen (39%) patients were in functional class (FC) I, 16 (42%) in FC II, six (15%) in FC III, and one patient in FC IV at the time of presentation. There were 18 survivors (13 in the surgical group and five in the nonsurgical group) and 20 nonsurvivors (four in the surgical group and 16 in the nonsurgical group). Causes of death in the nonsurgical group included congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary vascular disease, and occurred at a mean age of 8.4 years. Post-operative complications accounted for deaths in three of the four surgical patients. The survivors in the surgical group are presently in FC I/II. In the nonsurgical group, there was increased mortality, especially in those who presented in an earlier era, and a deterioration in functional class on follow-up due to the development of pulmonary vascular disease. Our data suggest that a) patients with Down syndrome and heart disease are helped by cardiac surgery with stabilization and improvement of their functional class; b) deterioration in functional class is seen in patients with Down syndrome with cardiac lesions who are managed nonsurgically [corrected] and c) mortality remains high in such patients treated nonsurgically due to development of pulmonary vascular disease and congestive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors review the larger social implications of the growing educational gap between black men and other segments of society, pose questions about some of the trends that have been mentioned, indicate lines for further research, and propose potential solutions to the problem of the deepening underrepresentation of black men in medical schools.\r"

  ".W": "There is, scientists proclaim, a crisis in biomedical research. The crisis lies in the fact that the community's expectations now exceed any reasonable capacity to fund its projects. Between the late 1960s and now, the community has felt threatened many times: by the government leaders' and the public's perceptions of what basic science can produce; by such government initiatives as the \"war on cancer,\" which steered funding to politically chosen areas of research; by changes in funding postgraduate research training; and by successive \"crises\" over the way NIH research funds are apportioned. None of these crises has resulted in the predicted dire consequences for the community, and the current one will not either. The challenge for the biomedical research community is to set priorities and allocate money accordingly. Despite the nation's economic and social problems, funding for biomedical research remains very high--$8 billion for the NIH, for example--and the community cannot expect that doubling or even tripling the budget would fund all the good ideas produced by a greatly expanded body of researchers. New policies for allocating funds among individual investigators, institutions, and infrastructure need to be put in place.\r"

The 40 projects of the program have involved 37 states, 55 medical schools, numerous other health professions schools, and 117 local community AHECs. This 19-month study (1988-1990) was undertaken to systematically assess and clarify the organization, functions, activities, and effects of the national AHEC program over two decades. Data sources were mainly 263 interviews of persons representing the full spectrum of those associated with and participating in AHECs. The findings describe a national network of school and community partnerships that were engaged in planning and implementing educational activities and were responsive to changing needs of health care. The individual AHECs differ in structure and activities as a function of the era in which each began, legislative requirements, and the specific community's needs for health professionals. As organizations, AHECs have unique functions that appear to have benefited the target communities or regions, participating schools, students, and medical school residents. Viability of AHECs in the future will depend on their ability to maintain a focus on health professions education in spite of state or community pressure to provide direct services--both clinical services and public education. At the same time, success will depend on the AHECs' capacity to respond effectively to changing needs of the community and the health care delivery system.\r"

The program was established in September 1986 to demonstrate that minority students who perform at least at grade level can begin a rigorous curriculum in the ninth grade and achieve outstanding results, provided that the necessary support systems are in place. For 1990-91, 750 students are enrolled in Gateway programs at five New York City public high schools, and the first 119 students graduated in June 1990. The graduates have demonstrated significant achievement compared with that of their peers, as measured by standardized tests and the graduates' participation in research mentorships and college acceptances. In order to expand on its initial success, the program has increased its scope of activity to include over 400 students at the junior high school level.\r"

A 1977 study at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (Penn) examined the organization of the school's basic sciences, including surveying the research interests and departmental affiliations of 101 basic science faculty at Penn and interviewing the basic science departments chairmen there and at five other research-intensive schools of medicine. The findings demonstrated overlapping interests among basic science investigators, significant blurring of departmental boundaries, and a divergence between the faculty members' research interests and the disciplines represented by the departments in which these faculty held appointments. A second study a decade later documented that this divergence had increased. This paper also addresses the mounting concern among medical educators in response to these kinds of developments, the effect of such developments on medical education, and issues concerning the teaching of basic sciences, course content, the responsibility of schools of medicine for effecting change, and a possible model for basic science instruction.\r"

One of the SUNY-Syracuse cohorts comprised the students who had completed all their work at the Syracuse campus, while the other comprised those who had spent their third year at the campus in Binghamton, which has a year-long, half-day-a-week primary care clerkship that is not available at the Syracuse campus, which has no primary care clerkship. Comparison of the proportions of the graduates in the two SUNY-Syracuse cohorts who chose family practice residencies, and comparisons of the proportions of graduates from other New York state schools and from all U.S. schools who selected family practice residencies during the same nine-year period, indicate that the proportion of students trained during their third year at the Binghamton campus who selected family practice residencies was significantly greater (21%; p less than .001). Additional investigation is required to determine whether the year-long nature of the required clerkship affects graduates' choices more than does the primary care content of the clerkship.\r"

Many students, residents, and attending physicians complain that they wish they had had a \"rotating\" or \"flexible\" internship. Graduate medical education authorities have recently recommended that the internship year return to a broad-based general medical education experience. In 1989, the authors surveyed the entire physician faculty and housestaff at a large academic health sciences center, asking them what type of first postgraduate year (PGY-1) the physicians had experienced themselves and what type of PGY-1 they recommended for future graduating medical students. Over one-third strongly recommended that the PGY-1 should be broad-based and not specialty-specific.\r"

Program evaluation included a videotaped interview, an assessment of the residents' skill in the management of patients' behavioral problems, and multiple-choice examinations. The program residents improved their interviewing skills more than did the comparison residents, particularly in the process and psychosocial content areas, and also did better in the management of patients' behavioral problems. There was no difference in factual knowledge of behavioral and developmental pediatrics and adolescent medicine. While traditional residency training in primary care may provide the resident with comparable cognitive knowledge, such training may not always improve the resident's ability to apply the knowledge in the primary care setting.\r"

The fundamental equations that allow calculation of the output and input power are developed. The output power in watts is 23.5 X 10(-4) (Pm - PDP)F, where Pm is mean arterial pressure and PDP is pouch diastolic pressure (mmHg); F is the pouch output flow (liters/min). The input power in watts is the oxygen consumed by the muscle in milliliters per second multiplied by 20.1. The oxygen consumed is equal to the product of muscle capillary flow and the A-VO2 difference across the muscle. The ratio of output power to input power is the efficiency; typical values range from 7 to 15%. At rest the typical 350 gm heart produces an output power of about 3.5 milliwatts/gram. Skeletal muscle can produce 10-15 milliwatts per gram; however, it is not known how long conditioned or unconditioned muscle can sustain this power level. In addition, it is not known what power level an electrically stimulated skeletal muscle can sustain for a prolonged period; this represents a gap in our knowledge of cardiac assistance using skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Artificial tracheas were fabricated from poly(L-lactic acid) mesh or unwoven cloth coated with collagen in order to reconstruct the respiratory airway by self regeneration without retaining the prosthesis at the replacement site, thus preventing infection, air leakage, granulation tissue formation, and displacement of the prosthesis. Nine weeks after placing a periosteal autologous graft from the tibia around the cervical trachea of a rabbit, bone rings formed without infection. Two weeks after replacement of an 8 X 8 mm window-shaped section of the cervical trachea with autologous periosteum, the internal surface of the trachea was well epithelialized without local complications, but ossification was not seen. One week after cervical substitution with our 2 cm long artificial trachea combined with the periosteal graft, cartilage was produced around the mesh material but neither ossification nor epithelization was observed thereafter, probably due to local infection. On the other hand, cartilage, bone, and epithelium did not form around the unwoven cloth artificial trachea after the substitution, probably because of severe infection due to collapse of the tracheal lumen. However, the formation of bone rings around the trachea suggests preservation of the neotracheal lumen, which may have potential for the treatment of tracheomalacia and/or bronchomalacia.\r"

A dual-loop recirculating flow system that accommodated human blood was developed and blood was subjected for 3 hr to various operating conditions known to alter fluid mechanics in the artificial ventricle. The operating conditions investigated were: 60 beats/min at 50% systolic duration, 60 beats/min at 30% systolic duration, and 90 beats/min at 50% systolic duration. Quantification of plasma free hemoglobin provided a direct indicator of hemolysis in the flow system. Platelet number and beta-thromboglobulin levels were monitored to investigate thrombotic activity, and levels of complement 3a were measured to examine complement system activation. The system was effective in demonstrating the relative hemolytic properties of the operating conditions. Ninety beats/min induced 37% more hemolysis than 60 beats/min at 50% systolic duration, and 50% systolic duration induced 32% more hemolysis than 30% systolic duration at 60 beats/min. There were no statistically significant changes in either platelet number or beta-thromboglobulin levels during the 3 hr recirculation period. Increases were seen in complement 3a levels, but these appeared to be surface-induced and not sensitive to the different operating conditions. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of the flow system in examining the relative hemolytic properties of the artificial ventricle, and suggest that bulk turbulent stresses may play a more important role than laminar wall shear stresses in mediating blood damage in this artificial ventricle.\r"

The lambs were instrumented with arterial and venous catheters, and a 5 French intra-aortic balloon catheter with balloon volumes of 3-5 ml was inserted into the femoral artery. A continuous infusion of heat-killed GBS organisms was infused at a rate of 1.7 to 6.2 x 10(8) org/kg/min, until a 30-50% decrease in cardiac output was attained. IABC was then instituted for 30 minutes, hemodynamic measurements repeated, and IABC was stopped. GBS infusion caused significant decreases in cardiac output (282 +/- 62 vs. 165 +/- 38 ml/min/kg) and pH (7.39 +/- 0.02 vs. 7.33 +/- 0.06), and significant increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure (14.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 36.2 +/- 12.1 mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (1.20 +/- 0.38 vs. 5.08 +/- 1.49 mm Hg/L/min/kg). Institution of IABC during continuous GBS infusion significantly increased cardiac output (225 +/- 1.27 ml/min/kg). The institution of the IABC also resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (2.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg/L/min/kg). The authors conclude that IABC improves cardiac output and decreases pulmonary vascular resistance in newborn lambs with GBS infection.\r"

If tapers, side holes, or integral connectors are present, M can be determined in-vitro with water by measuring pressure drop at various flows. The chart describes flow pressure functions for blood (Hct = 0.41) if M is known.

Bead diameters of 1.0 and 2.5 microns and suspension hematocrits from 15 to 80% were used. All profiles exhibited an excess of beads in the 20 microns closest to the wall and a uniform central concentration. Near-wall excesses greater than 2.5 times the central concentration occurred with suspensions having 2.5 microns beads when the hematocrit was 15-40%. Although large near-wall excesses sometimes occurred for the small beads and higher hematocrits, the usual event was a small near-wall excess. A Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxan test showed that the group of data for 2.5 microns beads in suspensions with hematocrits ranging from 15 to 40% was significantly different from all other data (p less than 0.0002). As the 2.5 microns beads approximate the average platelet, these data suggest that blood flows with physiologic hematocrits are associated with larger near-wall excesses of platelets than blood flows with elevated hematocrits.\r"

We found a significant correlation between eyes in terms of final scar size (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01). We found that 50% of fellow eyes with large macular scars (greater than 3 x 10(6) microns2) had similar sized lesions, while only 16% of fellow eyes with small macular scars (less than 0.5 x 10(6) microns2) had large scars (p less than 0.01). We discuss the significance of these findings in relation to the pathogenesis of subretinal neovascular membranes, and their implications for treatment.\r"

Factors associated with higher incidence of rejection included loose sutures, traumatic wound dehiscence, and grafts larger than 8.5 mm. Only three grafts with rejection episodes lost graft clarity, while rejection in the rest was successfully reversed with topical steroid therapy.

We have used DNA probes from within the retinoblastoma predisposition gene for unequivocal identification of gene carriers. The subsequent demonstration of regressed tumours in founder members of the family confirmed the diagnosis of a dominantly inherited disease. The circumstances of the management of this family emphasises the need for specialist ophthalmic examination of first degree relatives and detailed genetic analysis of all such families with DNA probes.\r"

However, use of a derived threshold value for each target group designated by the letters B to P (giving selective blue field scores) differentiated between normal subjects and those with early glaucomatous field loss. When used with a calculated upper limit of normal to give a specificity of 96%, this test had a sensitivity of 64%. Of the ocular hypertension group 22% gave abnormal results in comparison with normal persons.

The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--to investigate the role of glucose tolerance in the development of hypertension. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of the results of a health check up in a group of clinically healthy middle aged men in the late 1960s (median year 1968). The subjects were invited to enter into a primary prevention trial for cardiovascular disease in 1974, when they underwent clinical examination for risk factors. The trial was completed in 1979, when the men were re-examined. Follow up was in 1986. SETTING--Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland and second department of medicine, University of Helsinki. SUBJECTS--In all, 3490 men born during 1919-34 participated in a health check up in the late 1960s. In 1974, 1815 of these men who were clinically healthy were entered into a primary prevention trial for cardiovascular disease. On clinical examination 1222 of the men were considered at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Of these, 612 received an intervention and were excluded from the study. A total of 593 men were without risk factors. The study comprised all of the men who did not have an intervention (n = 1203). In 1979, 1120 men were re-examined, and in 1986 945 men attended follow up. There were two groups for analysis: one comprising all subjects and the other comprising only men who were normotensive in 1968 and for whom complete information was available. INTERVENTIONS--By 1979, 103 men were taking antihypertensive drugs, and by 1986, 131 were taking antihypertensive drugs and 12 were taking drugs for hyperglycaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load, blood pressure, and body weight were measured in 1968, 1974, and 1979. In 1986 blood pressure and body weight were recorded. RESULTS--Men who were hypertensive in 1986 had significantly higher blood pressures (p less than 0.0001) and (after adjustment for body mass index and alcohol intake) significantly higher blood glucose concentrations one hour after a glucose load at all examinations than those who were normotensive in 1986. Regression analysis showed that the higher the blood glucose concentration after a glucose load in 1968 the higher the blood pressure during the following years. Those men between the second and third tertiles of blood glucose concentration in 1968 had a significantly higher risk of developing hypertension (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.77) compared with those below the first tertile. CONCLUSION--In this study men who developed hypertension tended to have shown an increased intolerance to glucose up to 18 years before the clinical manifestation of their disorder. Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load was an independent predictor of future hypertension.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Prevalence of HIV-I and HIV-II infections as assessed by presence of serum antibodies. RESULTS--Overall rates of HIV infection were 40.2% in patients with tuberculosis (26.4% positive for HIV-I, 4.7% for HIV-II, and 9.0% for both); and 10.4% in blood donors (7.2% positive for HIV-I, 1.9% for HIV-II, and 1.3% for both). HIV-II infection was significantly more common in patients with all types of tuberculosis than in blood donors (97/2043, 4.7% v 40/2127, 1.9%; odds ratio 3.8%, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 5.6). CONCLUSION--Both HIV-I and HIV-II infections are associated with tuberculosis in Abidjan. 35% of adult tuberculosis in Abidjan is attributable to HIV infection and 4% specifically to HIV-II.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the prognosis and adverse prognostic factors in patients with retinal infarction due to presumed atheromatous thromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study. SETTING--University hospital departments of clinical neurology. PATIENTS--99 patients with retinal infarction, without prior stroke, referred to a single neurologist between 1976 and 1986 and evaluated and followed up prospectively until death or the end of 1986 (mean follow up 4.2 years). INTERVENTIONS--Cerebral angiography (55 patients), aspirin treatment (37), oral anticoagulant treatment (eight), carotid endarterectomy (13), cardiac surgery (six), and peripheral vascular surgery (two). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, stroke, coronary events, contralateral retinal infarction; survival analysis confined to 98 patients with retinal infarction due to presumed artheromatous thromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism (one patient with giant cell arteries excluded), and Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis, including age as a prognostic factor. RESULTS--During follow up 29 patients died (21 of vascular causes and eight of non-vascular or unknown causes), 10 had a first ever stroke, 19 had a coronary event, and only one developed contralateral retinal infarction. A coronary event accounted for more than half (59%) of the deaths whereas stroke was the cause of only one death (3%). Over the first five years after retinal infarction the actuarial average absolute risk of death was 8% per year; of stroke 2.5% per year (7.4% in the first year); of coronary events 5.3% per year, exceeding that of stroke; and of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death 7.4% per year. Prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of death were increasing age, peripheral vascular disease, cardiomegaly, and carotid bruit. Adverse prognostic factors for serious vascular events were increasing age and carotid bruit for stroke, and increasing age, cardiomegaly, and carotid bruit both for coronary events and for stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. CONCLUSIONS--Patients who present with retinal infarction due to presumed atherothromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism are at considerable risk of a coronary event. The risk of stroke, although high, is not so great. Not all strokes occurring after retinal infarction relate directly to disease of the ipsilateral carotid system, although this is probably the most common cause. Few patients experience contralateral retinal infarction. Non-arteritic retinal infarction should be diagnosed or confirmed by an ophthalmologist, and the long term care of patients with the condition should involve a physician who has an active interest in managing vascular disease.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study with completion of questionnaires before coronary artery bypass grafting and at three months, one year, and five years afterwards. SETTING--Regional cardiothoracic centre. PATIENTS--100 Male patients all aged below 60 at the time of operation, who were patients of two cardiothoracic surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patients' assessment of their health state in terms of functional capacity and aspects of distress, according to the Nottingham health profile and outcome of operation in terms of changes in symptoms, working life, and daily activities determined by self completed study questionnaires before operation and at three and six months afterwards. RESULTS--Intermediate one year results are reported. The differences between the Nottingham health profile scores before operation and at three months afterwards were significantly different (p less than 0.01), indicating an appreciable improvement in general health state, and at one year compared favourably with those from a normal male population. Analysis of responses to the study questionnaire showed that 65 of 89 patients (73%) were working at one year after operation with a further seven (8%) maintaining that they were fit to work but unable to find employment. The proportion of patients complaining of chest pain fell from 90% (88/98) before grafting to 19% (17/89) at one year after coronary artery bypass grafting, when 91% (81/89) patients maintained that their condition was either completely better or definitely improved. The significant positive factors affecting return to work and home activities were working before operation, short wait for operation, absence of breathlessness, and low physical mobility score in the Nottingham health profile (all p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS--Improvements were evident in general health state, symptoms, and activity at three months and one year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Interventions likely to influence outcomes included reduction in waiting times for operation; rehabilitation initiatives; and more attention to the quality of information given to patients, their relatives, and the community.\r"
