  ".U": "88004281\r", 
  ".W": "Previously, the antilipolytic effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been investigated in conventional adipocyte incubations. To define the effect of PGE2 on lipolysis more clearly, isolated epididymal adipocytes were studied with the perifusion system. PGE2 inhibited isoproterenol (100 nM)- and theophylline (1 mM)-stimulated lipolysis in a concentration-dependent manner in both the perifusion system and conventional incubations. However, the half-maximally inhibitory concentration (ED50) of PGE2 on isoproterenol-induced lipolysis was about 0.4 nM in the perifusion system, whereas the ED50 was 8 nM in the static adipocyte incubations. The ED50 values of PGE2 on theophylline-induced lipolysis were 0.8 nM (perifusion) and 5 nM (incubation), respectively. Thus, the sensitivity of stimulated lipolysis to PGE2 was about 10 times higher in the perifusion system than in conventional adipocyte incubations. In addition, the maximal antilipolytic effect of PGE2 was greater in the perifusion system. At a concentration of 100 nM PGE2 inhibited theophylline-induced lipolysis by 82 +/- 5% in adipocyte incubations, whereas lipolysis was inhibited by 100 +/- 3.5% in the perifusion system (P less than 0.05). When lipolysis was stimulated by isoproterenol the maximal antilipolytic effect of PGE2 was an inhibition of 90 +/- 2.5% in the perifusion system and 55 +/- 5% in adipocyte incubations (P less than 0.05). Moreover, the maximal antilipolytic effect was obtained at a PGE2 concentration of 20 nM in the perifusion system, but at a concentration of 100 nM in static incubations. The release of immunoreactive PGE2 from adipocytes was measured by RIA. In the perifusion system no PGE2 could be detected in the effluent under basal conditions; however, during exposure to 100 nM isoproterenol a small amount of PGE2 was detected (3-4.5 pg/10(6) cells X min). Exogenous PGE2 was almost totally (90%) recovered in the effluent. In adipocyte incubations basal PGE2 production was 103 +/- 22 pg/10(6) cells X 60 min, whereas both isoproterenol and theophylline increased these amounts of PGE2 2-fold (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that exogenous PGE2 has pronounced antilipolytic properties at very low concentrations (subnanomolar) in perifused adipocytes. The reduced sensitivity and maximal responsiveness of PGE2 in static incubations may be related to accumulation of FFA and endogenous PGs, which may partially obscure the interaction of exogenous PGE2 with the adenylate cyclase complex.\r"

No effect of PMA on P-33 mRNA half-life was detected when mRNA synthesis was inhibited with either actinomycin D or 5.6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole. The effects of insulin and PMA were additive at submaximal concentrations and no additivity was observed under these conditions at maximal concentrations. Thus PMA has a marked insulin-like effect on the accumulation of P-33 mRNA in rat hepatoma cells.\r"

In arterial membrane fractions from normal rats, the apparent receptor density varied with the ambient [Ca++] over the range, 0-10 mM. Receptor densities of 50 +/- 4, 102 +/- 4, and 156 +/- 5 fmol/mg membrane protein were obtained in low (0 mM), normal (4.8 mM), and high (25 mM) [Ca++], respectively. After 2 days of sodium loading, sodium depletion, and converting enzyme blockade altered receptor densities were detected in normal assay but not in high [Ca++] or low [Ca++], indicating changes in the relationship between [Ca++] and apparent receptor density. Similar results were obtained after 12 days of sodium loading or converting enzyme blockade. After 12 days of sodium depletion, there was no difference in receptor density between normal and high [Ca++] (44 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein) and the value obtained in low [Ca++] (27 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein) was significantly below that for all other groups. No change in receptor affinity was observed. These results suggest that there are two stages in vascular angiotensin receptor regulation; an initial masking-unmasking process which involves Ca++, and with prolonged agonist occupancy, an actual loss of receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Sex differences in the pulsatile secretion of LH were examined in male and female ferrets after mating. Female ferrets which were either gonadally intact and in estrus or gonadectomized and maintained on a pulsed regimen of daily estradiol (E2) injections exhibited a prolonged rise in plasma LH, characterized by an elevation in mean LH levels and an increase in the number of LH pulses after receiving an intromission from a stud male. By contrast, no such increase in LH secretion occurred in males which achieved an intromission with a female, regardless of whether they were gonadally intact and in breeding condition or gonadectomized and given pulsed estrogen. In fact, intact breeding males which achieved an intromission had significantly fewer LH pulses 1-5 h later than unmated males bled serially over the same time period. This decrease in LH pulse frequency was followed by a significant rise in mean plasma levels of androgen 5-12 h later. When a sexually dimorphic LH response to intromission was observed in gonadectomized E2-treated ferrets, we asked whether this could reflect a sex difference in pituitary responsiveness to the endogenous release of GnRH. Thus, plasma LH levels were measured in gonadectomized and gonadectomized E2-treated ferrets for 2 h after iv injection of GnRH. In the absence of gonadal steroids, ferrets exhibited a sex-specific difference in LH responsiveness to GnRH; however, no sex difference was apparent under the influence of E2. These findings demonstrate that ferrets' sexually dimorphic LH responses to intromission probably reflect a sex difference in the processing of somatosensory inputs from the genitalia or in the neural control of GnRH release into the pituitary portal vessels.\r"

  ".U": "88004299\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by streptozotocin. This gave rise to a loss of somatomedin activity in serum. The loss of somatomedin activity was due to the presence of inhibitors associated with serum proteins having mol wts of less than 1, 1-10, 30-50, and 300 K. Whereas less than 1, 1-10, and 30-50 kilodalton fractions were not inhibitory in control and insulin-treated animals, greater than 300 kilodalton fraction was inhibitory in control and insulin-treated animals; the inhibitory activity of this fraction in diabetic animals was significantly greater than that in controls and insulin-treated animals. The appearance of these inhibitors in diabetic animals was accompanied by reduced skeletal growth. Treatment of diabetic animals with insulin abolished the somatomedin-inhibitory activity of serum and corrected the skeletal growth deficit. Serum inhibitors of somatomedin may, therefore, be involved in the causation of some of the complications of diabetes, including impaired skeletal growth.\r"

With the use of an anti-alpha TGF monoclonal antibody generated against a C-terminal rat alpha TGF synthetic peptide, alpha TGF-like material was localized by immunohistochemical techniques in the cytoplasm of normal bovine adenohypophysial cells. The antibody staining was immunospecific because it could be completely inhibited by saturating concentrations of the synthetic peptide to which it was raised. There was no immunoreactivity in cells of the intermediate and posterior lobes. Some of the cells containing alpha TGF immunoreactivity also contained PRL; alpha TGF immunoreactivity was not demonstrated in cells containing ACTH, TSH, FSH, and LH. This is the first report documenting the secretion of alpha TGF by nonneoplastic adult cells and the presence of alpha TGF immunoreactivity in the corresponding normal adult tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations suggest a role for interleukin 1 (IL-1), a macrophage-derived cytokine, in the autoimmune B cell destruction, which is observed in type 1 diabetes. In the present study we have investigated the effects of IL-1 and two other cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on the pancreatic B cell paying particular attention to insulin production and glucose metabolism. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated and kept in tissue culture for 5 days. The islets were subsequently transferred to media containing medium RPMI 1640 plus 0.5% human serum with or without additions of human recombinant preparations of either IL-1 (25 U/ml), TNF (1000 U/ml), or IFN-gamma (500 U/ml), and cultured for another 48 h. After the culture period the islets were subjected to light microscope examination and different functional tests in short-term incubations in the absence of cytokines. IL-1 was found to reduce insulin release in culture and totally inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release in short-term incubations. Islet (pro)insulin biosynthesis, glucose oxidation, and oxygen uptake at 16.7 mM glucose were partially inhibited by IL-1. The DNA content of islets cultured with IL-1 was decreased and may partly explain these latter findings. However, inhibition of glucose oxidation could not be seen in islets exposed to IL-1 in short-term experiments only. By light microscopy there were marked signs of degeneration in IL-1 treated islets. TNF and IFN-gamma were essentially without effect on islet morphology or function. The results of this study indicate that IL-1 may be cytotoxic to islet B cells. The primary toxic action of IL-1 seems to involve factors other than an impaired islet glucose metabolism.\r"

The effect of oPRL (2 micrograms/ml) on insulin secretion was time dependent and reached a maximum on day 4 when there was a 2.4-fold increase in insulin secretion from cultured neonatal rat islets (n = 6, P less than 0.001). When islets cultured in the presence of oPRL for 4 days were perifused, 300 mg/dl glucose stimulation resulted in insulin release of 131 +/- 20 microU/ml.100 micrograms islet tissue as compared to control islets 94 +/- 20 microU/ml.100 micrograms islet tissue (n = 7, P less than 0.02). Stimulation of the islets with a linear 30-250 mg/dl glucose gradient resulted in a threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of 73 +/- 6 mg/dl glucose for the oPRL treated islets (n = 7) as compared to a threshold of 123 +/- 6 mg/dl glucose for control islets (n = 7, P less than 0.001). Mean islet volume was unchanged after 4 days of oPRL treatment but was 34% greater after 8 days (n = 6, P less than 0.001). Dye coupling among central islet B cells was also increased after in vitro treatment with oPRL for 4 days. The mean projected area of dye spread was 2-fold greater in the oPRL treated islets (n = 33) in comparison to the control islets (n = 33, P less than 0.05). These results indicate that in vitro lactogen treatment, in the form of oPRL, alters insulin secretory behavior and B cell junctional communication and supports our hypothesis that lactogen, insulin secretion, and junctional communication among B cells are related.\r"

  ".W": "Chick embryos after 48 h of development (day 2) maintained in ovo provide an adequate model to study hormonal influences in early organogenesis in vertebrates. In previous studies at this (prepancreatic) stage of chick embryogenesis we demonstrated not only the presence of an insulin-related material but also insulin receptors and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors. Further, when embryos developed in the presence of antiinsulin antibodies, we showed retardation in both morphological and biochemical events which strongly suggested a physiological requirement for insulin in normal embryogenesis. In the present study we have evaluated the effects of insulin, proinsulin, desoctapeptide insulin, and IGF-I when applied to day 2 chick embryos. At day 4 of development biochemical indices were compared in treated vs. control groups. Insulin (10-100 ng/embryo) increased the content of protein, total creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB isozyme, triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, DNA, and RNA, in a dose-dependent fashion. IGF-I had a lower potency than insulin in stimulating both metabolic and growth indices and was nearly equipotent in stimulating the creatine kinase MB content (marker of muscle differentiation). The high relative potency of insulin together with the effects of proinsulin (less than 15%) and desoctapeptide insulin (less than 10%) compared to insulin on the chick embryo, led us to infer that at low doses (nanograms per embryo) insulin stimulates developmental processes mainly through the insulin receptor, with the possible exception of muscle differentiation. The broad range of metabolic, growth, and differentiation indices stimulated by insulin and IGF-I in chick embryos, at a stage when specific receptors for both peptides are present, suggests that insulin and IGF-I may have a regulatory, complementary, or overlapping role in normal chick embryo early development.\r"

Therefore, we investigated the role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) on the release of LHRH from the hypothalamus. Four rat hypothalami were perifused with Krebs-Ringer buffer, and after a 60-min preincubation period, PLA2 was applied during 10 min. The LHRH response was determined by RIA of 10-min fractions collected for the next 60 min. PLA2 induced LHRH release in a dose-related manner at amounts of 2, 10, and 50 U. Omission of Ca++ from the medium using EGTA eliminated the PLA2 effect. Indomethacin treatment increased rather than diminished the PLA2 stimulation. Perifusion with melittin, an activator of PLA2, also increased LHRH release. These results are interpreted as a demonstration that PLA2 has a role in the release of LHRH and that a different route of the cyclooxygenase may be involved besides the well known mediation of prostaglandin E2.\r"

This ACTH response to IL-1 was, however, completely abolished by preinjection of 0.5 ml rabbit antiserum generated against rat CRF, but not by normal rabbit serum (NRS). The IL-1-induced ACTH release did not seem to be caused by a general stress effect of IL-1 because plasma PRL levels, another indicator of a stress response, were not altered by the injection of IL-1. These results suggest that IL-1 acts centrally in the brain to stimulate the secretion of CRF, thereby eliciting ACTH release, and that a direct action of IL-1 on the pituitary gland is unlikely.\r"

Attempts were made to adapt to human diabetic patients a protocol successfully used in prediabetic BB rats. Twenty-two type I diabetic patients (duration of disease less than 4 wk) were randomized to treatment or control groups; the treatment patients were given one buffy coat (approximately 0.6 X 10(9) T-lymphocytes) weekly for 5 wk. Plasma C-peptide (stimulated and unstimulated), insulin dose, and hemoglobin A1c were measured before and periodically after the treatment for 24 wk. The control group underwent the same studies. Although there were no significant differences for the parameters studied between the two groups, 2 of 12 patients in the treatment group underwent three complete (normal glycemia without insulin) temporary remissions. One of these patients was given a second course of transfusions after relapse from the first remission and developed a second complete remission that lasted 2 mo. No control patient had remissions during the 24-wk study. Although the future of adoptive immunotherapy in the treatment or prevention of diabetes is not known, several probable limitations of the current protocol, as discussed here, can explain the differences in results between this trial and the rodent studies.\r"

Islets were isolated from rats immediately after lactation or from rats bearing mammosomatotropic tumors (MtTW15), conditions involving high levels of prolactin (either 5-fold or 1000-fold control levels, respectively). When beta-cells were microinjected with the gap junction permeant dye Lucifer yellow CH, the mean number of dye-coupled cells per injection was approximately 10-fold greater than in islets from virgin control rats. As a more direct test of the effects of prolactin on beta-cell coupling, islets isolated from virgin rats were treated for 90 min with 500 ng/ml rat prolactin in the presence of low glucose (2.8 mM) and were microinjected with dye. The mean number of dye-coupled cells per injection increased by 6.7-fold over controls with low glucose, demonstrating a direct effect of prolactin on beta-cell coupling. In vitro treatment with high glucose (16.7 mM) resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in dye-coupled cells per injection. We discuss the possible relationship between the effects of glucose and of prolactin on coupling.\r"

The presence of ICSA was assessed by incubating serum immunoglobulin fractions with normal Wistar rat islet cells and identifying cell-bound immunoglobulins by indirect immunofluorescence and by a complement-induced cell toxicity reaction. Under the selected experimental conditions, none of the diabetes-resistant rats were ICSA positive over the entire study period (45-120 days of age). In two diabetes-prone BB rat strains, 19 animals developed diabetes with onset between 50 and 120 days. At day 45, none of these animals was positive for ICSA. In rats developing diabetes between 50 and 85 days of age, 7 of 9 animals presented ICSA at clinical onset, determined by either the immunofluorescence or cytotoxicity test. The antibodies bound to insulin-containing beta-cells but not to other islet cell types, and binding was not eliminated by absorption with liver powder. In animals developing diabetes between 85 and 120 days, only 1 of 10 was positive for beta-cell-specific surface antibodies at onset of the disease. After 30 days of insulin treatment, beta-cell-specific antibodies were detectable in 3 of 4 animals of age 50-85 days, whereas only 3 of 12 older rats presented ICSAs that were, in addition, of low titer or affinity. Our data confirm that ICSAs develop in diabetic BB rats and indicate that these antibodies can bind specifically to islet beta-cells compared with other islet cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These effects were observed 10-20 days after the injection of the blasts. Focal lesions of insulitis were absent in neonates killed 1 and 3 days after the blast injection but were observed in neonates killed on the 5th and 8th day. As determined by autoradiography after the injection of [3H]thymidine-labeled blasts, numerous blast cells migrated and settled in various immature lymph nodes and in the spleen within 24 h after injection. Focal mononuclear infiltrations in the islets containing labeled and unlabeled cells were again observed on the 5th and 8th day but not on the 1st and 3rd day after injection. These experiments indicate that target-specific blasts undergo a short phase of proliferation and maturation in lymphoid organs of the recipients, before initiating the autoimmune process in the pancreatic islets. They further suggest that specific immune cells rather than humoral anti-islet antibodies are more likely to play the major role in this autoimmune animal model of diabetes.\r"

Because insulin regulates these functions in other tissues by binding to its receptor, we have investigated the presence of insulin receptors in canine small intestinal mucosa with basolateral membranes (BLM) and brush border membranes (BBM) prepared by sorbitol density centrifugation. A14-[125I]iodoinsulin was used to study binding and structural characteristics of specific insulin receptors in BLM. Analysis of receptors in BLM identified binding sites with high affinity (Kd 88 pM) and low capacity (0.4 pmol/mg protein) as well as with low affinity (Kd 36 nM) and high capacity (4.7 pmol/mg protein). Binding was time, temperature, and pH dependent, and 125I-labeled insulin dissociation was enhanced in the presence of unlabeled insulin. Cross-reactivity of these receptors to proinsulin, IGF-II, and IGF-I was 4, 1.8, and less than 1%, respectively. Covalent cross-linking of labeled insulin to BLM insulin receptors with disuccinimidyl suberate revealed a single 135,000-Mr band that was completely inhibited by unlabeled insulin. There was a 16-fold greater specific binding of insulin to BLM (39.0 +/- 2.4%) than to BBM (2.5 +/- 0.6%). These results demonstrate the presence of a highly specific receptor for insulin on the vascular, but not the luminal, surface of the small intestinal mucosa in dogs, and suggest that insulin may play an important role in the regulation of gastrointestinal physiology.\r"

Results were compared with those observed in nondiabetic subjects. Although both forms of therapy improved chronic glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin concentration went from 9.6 +/- 0.7 to 7.6 +/- 0.5 and 7.1 +/- 0.2%, respectively, P less than .01), exogenous insulin resulted in a lower postprandial glycemic response than tolazamide (P less than .001). Both agents comparably increased (P less than .01) fasting and integrated postprandial insulin concentrations. However, the initial rate of postprandial increase was greater with exogenous insulin (P less than .05). Tolazamide (P less than .05) but not exogenous insulin increased postprandial C-peptide concentrations. However, tolazamide did not improve the deficient early insulin release. Both agents (P less than .05) lowered postabsorptive hepatic glucose release (from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg . kg-1 . min-1), but not to normal rates (1.8 +/- 0.1 mg . kg-1 . min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Large amounts of the 125I-insulin complexed to guinea pig IgG1 antibodies remained in the blood for at least 30 min. The bioavailability of 125I-insulin bound to IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies was inhibited for at least 30 min because significantly less was available for rapid binding to insulin receptors on hepatocytes and renal tubular cells and its subsequent rapid degradation. The bioavailability of 125I-insulin was further decreased when bound to antibodies in native guinea pig antiserum or a mixture of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies compared with the 125I-insulin complexed to either purified IgG1 or IgG2 antibodies alone. The 125I-insulin bound to antibodies in native guinea pig antiserum or a mixture of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies was distributed in vivo in a manner reflecting the relative concentrations of the IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies present. The bioavailability, distribution, and metabolic fate of 125I-insulin in immune complexes prepared with homologous Lou/m rat insulin antiserum was qualitatively similar to that observed with immune complexes prepared with guinea pig insulin antiserum. It appears that the Lewis rat can be used as an in vivo model to study the bioavailability,distribution,and metabolic fate of insulin bound to xenogenic or homologous insulin antibodies.\r"

Specific 125I-labeled insulin binding to these receptor preparations in the presence of different insulin concentrations was higher in fetal and neonatal rats compared with that in the adult rats. The electrophoretic mobilities of the alpha- and beta-subunits on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography were similar at different stages of development. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptors was similar in the different groups. With fixed amounts of protein, the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in the presence of different insulin concentrations (1 X 10(-8) to 1 X 10(-6) M) was significantly higher in the fetal and neonatal rats than in adult rats. However, when expressed as a function of insulin-binding activity, the insulin-stimulated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in fetal and neonatal rats appears to be similar to that in adult rats because of decreased insulin binding in the latter group. These results demonstrate the structural and functional similarities of hepatic insulin receptors in fetal, neonatal, and adult rats. The relative differences in insulin-mediated biological functions in fetal and adult rat livers as reported previously are due to alterations in a step(s) distal to activation of insulin-receptor kinase.\r"

We created a model of loss of the early phase of insulin release in normal volunteers. Somatostatin (SRIF) was briefly infused (from -5 to 15 min) during intravenous (IVGTT) and oral (OGTT) glucose tolerance tests. The thermic response to oral glucose was determined under these conditions by indirect calorimetry. Early insulin release was totally blocked during IVGTT and OGTT by SRIF infusion. During the IVGTT, glucose tolerance was deteriorated in association with loss of the early phase of insulin release as indicated by a decrease in the K value (control 1.9 +/- 0.36 vs. SRIF 1.1 +/- 0.27, P less than .001). Higher plasma glucose concentrations were observed during SRIF tests in the OGTT at 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min; total glycemic excursion was larger during the SRIF test (9473 +/- 3089 mg X dl-1 X 5 h-1) when compared with the control condition (6583 +/- 2329 mg X dl-1 X 5 h-1). During the OGTT the total amount of glucose oxidized (control 56 +/- 4.2 vs. SRIF 55 +/- 3.4 g/5 h) was similar in both conditions, suggesting that nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal were responsible for the deterioration in glucose tolerance. Surprisingly, we found that glucose-induced thermogenesis was reduced in association with loss of the early phase of insulin release (control 102 +/- 21.3 vs. SRIF 72 +/- 27.8 J/5 h, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No false-positive or false-negative readings were obtained in 258 observations when the results by FSPM were compared with those by IFL. The intra- and interassay variabilities encountered were not enough to misclassify a specimen. The presence of anti-thyroid, anti-adrenal, or anti-nuclear antibodies did not produce false-positive readings. Twenty-eight additional specimens from diabetic children were also analyzed via three blood group type O pancreases. There was complete agreement concerning the presence or absence of ICA between IFL and FSPM analyses. Analysis of the three pancreases yielded different numbers of results positive for ICA (14/28 vs. 22/28 vs. 15/28, P = .008) in both assays. Thus, selection of pancreatic substrate may influence the outcome of assays for ICA. A matrix of fluorescent microspheres has been devised that allows calibration of the FSPM system. Now, reproducible and comparable readings for ICA values can be obtained from the various reporting laboratories. Should an international reference serum for ICA become available, the remaining problem in the ICA assay, that of substrate (pancreas) variability, should be resolved.\r"

Plasma [3-3H]glucose radioactivity approached a steady state only 5-6 h after initiation of the primed continuous infusion, and a 20% overestimate of HGO was demonstrated by not allowing sufficient time for tracer labeling of the glucose pool. Assumption of steady-state instead of non-steady-state kinetics in using Steele's equations to calculate glucose turnover resulted in a 9-24% overestimate of HGO. Stimulation of glycogenolysis by glucagon injection demonstrated no incorporation of [3-3H]glucose in hepatic glycogen during the prolonged tracer infusion. In a separate study, plasma glucose was maintained at fasting levels (207 +/- 17 mg/dl) for 8 h with the glucose-clamp technique. Total glucose turnover rates remained constant during this prolonged tracer infusion. However, HGO fell to 30% of the basal value simply by maintaining fasting hyperglycemia in the presence of basal insulin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We introduce an approach by which a prehepatic insulin release pattern is calculated from plasma insulin and C-peptide, without separate C-peptide kinetic analysis. Human insulin and C-peptide were infused intraportally into conscious dogs (n = 11) at equimolar rates; endogenous insulin and C-peptide release were suppressed with somatostatin (0.8 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1). Insulin and C-peptide were infused at basal and equimolar rates (range 19-72 pmol/min in dogs), and the infusions were slowly increased, in stepwise fashion, to a maximum at 60 min (range 152-613 pmol/min) and subsequently renormalized at either 85 (n = 6) or 195 (n = 5) min. Plasma insulin and C-peptide measurements were described simultaneously by a composite model of insulin and C-peptide plasma kinetics, with the molar intraportal appearance rate due to the infusion R(t) as an unknown input for both insulin and C-peptide catabolism. The model assumes one-compartment disappearance kinetics for both peptides. Fitting the model to the measured insulin and C-peptide data, we were able to compute the insulin-appearance pattern accurately for every experiment; calculated and actual secretion rates were highly correlated (r = .93-.97) and had very similar temporal patterns. Also calculated were the fractional disappearance rates for human insulin (t1/2 = 6.9 min) and C-peptide (t1/2 = 14 min) in the dog, as well as the C-peptide distribution volume (12.3 +/- 0.5% body wt).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both studies a mixture of casein (11%) and glucose (9%) was infused through a chronic indwelling intraduodenal catheter to evoke CCK secretion. Plasma was analyzed for insulin, glucose, glucagon, and tyrosine many times during the procedure. Prior administration of the CCK antagonist significantly attenuated the increase in plasma insulin and glucagon after casein infusion. These results support the concept that cholecystokinin plays an important physiologic role in the in vivo regulation of postprandial plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations after protein ingestion.\r"

Fc receptors were found to exist continuously along the sinusoidal lining. The receptors showed no zonal distribution in the rat, and they were generally scarce near the central veins and portal areas in humans. To characterize the sinusoidal cells, carbon or latex was given intravenously and endogenous peroxidase was demonstrated for the rat, whereas factor VIII-related antigen and endogenous peroxidase were demonstrated for the humans. In the rat, Fc receptors were detected on Kupffer cells, which were characterized by an intense endogenous peroxidase activity and ingestion of latex or quantities of carbon. They were also detected on sinusoidal endothelial cells, which were characterized by undetectable peroxidase activity and no ingestion of latex nor of a small quantity of carbon. In humans, Fc receptors were also present on Kupffer cells as well as sinusoidal endothelial cells, as identified by endogenous peroxidase and factor VIII-related antigen, respectively.\r"

This study included tissue specimens from 10 patients with ulcerative colitis and 8 with Crohn's colitis. Paired immunofluorescence staining was performed with subclass-specific murine monoclonal antibodies combined with a rabbit antibody reagent of IgG; the proportion of cells belonging to each subclass could thereby be determined in relation to the total number of mucosal IgG immunocytes. A significantly higher median proportion of IgG1 immunocytes was found in ulcerative colitis (81.3%) than in Crohn's colitis (66.5%). Conversely, the median proportion of IgG2 immunocytes was significantly higher in Crohn's colitis (24.9%) than in ulcerative colitis (9.4%). This disparity in the local IgG subclass response might reflect dissimilar mucosal exposure to mitogenetic or antigenic stimuli or genetically determined immunoregulatory differences in the two categories of patients.\r"

This study compares the efficacy of TDB with two different cimetidine dosages in the treatment of duodenal ulcer patients who failed to respond to an eight week therapy with H2-blockers. Fifty two patients (40 men, 12 women) were randomly allocated to one of the following three oral regimens: (1) TDB 120 mg quid, (2) cimetidine 400 mg tid, (3) cimetidine 400 mg with meals plus 800 mg at bedtime. Endoscopy was carried out after four weeks; if the ulcer had not healed patients continued with the same treatment for a further four week period when they were endoscopically reassessed. After four weeks similar percentages of ulcer healing were registered in the two cimetidine schedules (39% with 1.2 g and 44% with 2 g), whereas TDB resulted in a significantly higher healing rate (82%) compared with cimetidine 1.2 g (p = 0.01) and with cimetidine 2 g (p = 0.025). After eight weeks the cumulative percentages of healing were 65% on cimetidine 1.2 g, 75% on cimetidine 2 g, and 94% on TDB (TDB v cimetidine 1.2 p = 0.042). These results confirm previous data that resistant duodenal ulcers are more responsive to an agent which strengthens the mucosal defences than to antisecretory compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperammonemia is a well-recognized metabolic abnormality which occurs in cirrhotic patients with advanced liver dysfunction. We recently documented that hyperglucagonemia that occurs as a result of hepatic glycogen depletion may be responsible for this hyperammonemia by promoting gluconeogenesis to provide glucose as a fuel for functioning of several organ systems. Thus, hepatic glycogen depletion may be the initial process responsible for hyperammonemia. Since the glucose rise following intravenous glucagon administration is a reflection of hepatic glycogen breakdown, we studied the effect of glucagon (1 mg) injection on plasma glucose, insulin and ammonia levels after an overnight fast in cirrhotic patients and normal subjects. Glucose rise was significantly stunted, and ammonia rise was significantly greater in patients with advanced liver dysfunction as compared to normal subjects. Furthermore, the smaller the glucose increment, the earlier the ammonia rise. The smallest glucose responses were seen in the patients with the highest basal plasma ammonia levels. Finally, significant negative relationships were noted between the glucose response to glucagon administration (delta glucose) and the degree of liver dysfunction as reflected by Composite Clinical Laboratory Index, as well as basal ammonia and ammonia responses (delta ammonia) on the other. Therefore, this study suggests that hepatic glycogen depletion may be the initial event leading to elevated plasma ammonia concentrations in hepatic cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "The major part of hepatocellular iron is derived from uptake of transferrin-bound iron by means of nonspecific fluid-phase endocytosis and specific, saturable binding on high-affinity transferrin receptors. We investigated the expression of transferrin receptors on hepatocytes in liver biopsies of 22 cases of hemochromatosis (21 primary hemochromatosis and 1 secondary hemochromatosis), using immunohistochemical demonstration of the human transferrin receptor with the specific monoclonal antibody OKT9. Fifty liver biopsies (normal and pathological) without demonstrable iron storage (Perls' stain negative) served as controls. In the controls, membranous and/or cytoplasmic transferrin receptor expression was always present on hepatocytes, albeit in variable numbers and patterns without obvious relation to the underlying liver disease. In 19 of 22 hemochromatosis cases with severe iron overload, OKT9 immunoreactivity on hepatocytes was completely absent. Three hemochromatosis cases showed few hepatocytes positive for OKT9. One showed mild iron overload, while the second, a successfully treated case, was free of iron. The remaining hemochromatosis case was a known alcoholic with severe iron overload. Since OKT9 binding to the transferrin receptor is not blocked by previous binding of transferrin, the findings show that in advanced hemochromatosis hepatocytes do not express transferrin receptors. This finding is in keeping with the inverse relation between transferrin receptor expression and exogenous iron supply in various cell cultures. These results indicate that in hemochromatosis,apparently as a result of progressive iron overload,transferrin receptor expression on hepatocytes disappears.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Endothelial cells were characterized by phase-contrast microscopy, electron microscopy and the presence of Factor VIII-related antigen. Fibronectin secretion was determined in cell-free supernatants by a sensitive and specific ELISA and localized on fixed cultured cells by immunofluorescence. [35S]Methionine endogeneously labeled fibronectin was immunoprecipitated from supernatants and cellular lysates and displayed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. After attachment to the culture vessel, one day after plating, endothelial cells start to produce fibronectin as measured by ELISA and demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Secretion of fibronectin increases as cells proliferate to form a confluent monolayer. By immunofluorescence, fibronectin is visualized inside permeabilized cells and as a fibrillar network on the cell surface. Underneath the cell bodies, fibronectin-positive material is present as short strands. From supernatants and cellular lysates, fibronectin is immunoprecipitated with an apparent Mr of about 235,000 obviously larger than plasma fibronectin with an Mr of 220,000, which behaves electrophoretically like fibronectin isolated from early hepatocyte cultures. As endothelial cells incorporate [3H]fucose in fibronectin, whereas hepatocytes do not, we conclude that endothelial cells in contrast to hepatocytes produce cellular fibronectin. Endothelial cells, therefore, are probably the cellular source of the fibronectin present in the space of Disse. The significance of this finding with respect to fibrotic liver disease is discussed.\r"

The IgG fractions of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis Stage I reacting exclusively with a pair of polypeptides at 48,000 daltons (p 48) on Western blot and from a patient with Stage III primary biliary cirrhosis reacting exclusively with a single 62,000 dalton polypeptide (p 62) were labeled with 125I; two radioimmunoassays were established detecting antimitochondrial antibodies against p 62 and p 48, respectively. Autologous sera blocked the assay, but the two reference sera did not block each other. Fourteen of 40 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis reacted with p 62, 6/40 with p 48 and 20 sera with both antigens. Sera from 200 patients with various hepatic and nonhepatic diseases were negative for anti-p 62 and anti-p 48. This collection of sera included 5 patients with nonhepatic autoimmune disorders, 3 with drug-induced pseudolupus syndrome and 2 with syphilis II, which were positive for antimitochondrial antibodies by immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial autoantigens p 62 and p 48 were both localized on mitoplasts, presumably inner mitochondrial membranes; they were thermolabile, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-sensitive, but resistant to DNAase, RNAase and neuraminidase treatments. In cesium chloride density gradients, p 62 floated at 1.28 gm per cm3 and p 48 at 1.30 gm per cm3. Thus, radioimmunoassays have been developed that specifically detect two distinct primary biliary cirrhosis-specific subtypes of antimitochondrial antibodies: anti-p 62 and anti-p 48. All primary biliary cirrhosis sera were positive for at least one of these antimitochondrial antibodies subtypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These abnormalities in the plasma levels of the pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon have been thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the abnormal plasma ratio of branched-chain amino acids to aromatic amino acids. To evaluate this issue, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon, C-peptide and the branched-chain and aromatic amino acids were measured before and serially after orthotopic liver transplantation in 9 humans and 5 dogs. The abnormal plasma amino acid levels rapidly improved and achieved normal levels following orthotopic liver transplantation. Insulin levels also became normal following orthotopic liver transplantation, despite enhanced insulin secretion documented by an even further increased level of C-peptide. In contrast, the baseline abnormal plasma glucagon levels which are commonly seen in cirrhotics became even more abnormal following orthotopic liver transplantation. Despite this progressive increase in the abnormally elevated plasma glucagon levels, plasma amino acid levels, both branched-chain and aromatic, became normal. These data demonstrate that before and after orthotopic liver transplantation, there is: (i) no relationship between the changes in the plasma levels of glucagon and changes observed in the plasma level of amino acids; and (ii) plasma insulin and amino acid levels change in the same direction. In addition, these changes in plasma insulin and amino acid levels following orthotopic liver transplantation occur despite enhanced secretion of insulin evidenced by the progressive increase in plasma levels of C-peptide.\r"

Anti-HBsAg responses in the two groups were compared. Passively acquired anti-HBsAg positivity rates at birth were 51.5 and 45.0% in Groups I and II, respectively. Cumulative anti-HBsAg seroconversion rates in Group I were 12.2, 76.6, 82.6 and 86.4% at 2, 4, 14 and 16 months, while the rates in Group II were 2.5, 62.5, 73.7 and 91.0%, showing no significant difference (p greater than 0.05). Significant difference in seroconversion rates at the 2-month follow-up stage between passively acquired anti-HBsAg-negative and -positive groups was observed (11.9 vs. 2.6%). Significant rise in anti-HBsAg titer at 16 months following the booster at 14 months was noted: 36.4 mIU per ml before, 546.4 mIU per ml after in Group I and 25.3 mIU per ml before, 782.6 mIU per ml after in Group II. The booster, 12 months after the primary vaccination series, is therefore considered imperative for maximum effectiveness of hepatitis B active immunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88006362\r", 
  ".W": "Effects of oral treatment with taurine on fluid intakes produced by renin were assessed in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto strain (SHR). Renin injected into the preoptic area increased water intake and evoked salt (2.7% NaCl solution) intake, and angiotensin II injected into this area increased water intake, but not salt intake, in both SHR and control normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The salt intake elicited by renin, but not water intake produced by renin or angiotensin II, was potentiated in SHR. These effects of renin and angiotensin II on fluid intakes were antagonized by previous administration of taurine or gamma-aminobutyric acid into the cerebral ventricles in both strains. When SHR received water containing 3% taurine from 32 to 105 days of age, development of hypertension was inhibited. Renin administered into the preoptic area at 105 days of age caused an increase in salt intake, but the increase was markedly inhibited by the oral administration of taurine as well. These results show that salt appetite produced by centrally administered renin is exaggerated in SHR and that development of hypertension as well as renin-induced salt appetite in SHR is inhibited by dietary taurine.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported that 50% of subjects with normal renin essential hypertension have both delayed suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis following sodium infusion and a delayed rate of excretion of an acute salt load. In another study we have also described a subset of patients with essential hypertension (called nonmodulators) who have several abnormalities, including a pressor response to salt loading. To evaluate whether the abnormalities described in these different groups of patients actually occur in the same patient, we assessed the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis response to short-term saline loading in 38 hypertensive patients. Their ability to modulate was determined by their renal vascular response to infused angiotensin II on a high salt diet (200 mEq Na). In response to a 3-hour infusion of saline, 75 mEq/hr, the reduction in plasma renin activity at both 60 and 120 minutes was significantly greater (p less than 0.008) in patients with normal modulation than in the nonmodulators. Plasma aldosterone levels were also significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in those with intact modulation. Thus, nonmodulating essential hypertensive patients have abnormalities in several systems that influence sodium homeostasis, including altered adrenal and renal vascular response to angiotensin II, altered renal blood flow response to salt loading, and a delayed suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with short-term saline infusion.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol, all subjects received dietary supplements of cream, safflower oil, and carbohydrate in random sequence, each prepared in flavored yogurt or milk. Each supplement was administered for 6 weeks and followed by a 4-week washout period of no supplementation. Dietary linoleic acid increased from 4.6 to 13% of energy intake when the safflower oil replaced cream, while saturated fat decreased from 16 to 10%. Total fat intake was 37 to 38% during the cream and safflower oil periods but was 28% during the carbohydrate period. Compliance with the diets was demonstrated by significant changes in fasting plasma fatty acid measurements. Mean clinic BP was 135 +/- 9/93 +/- 6 mm Hg at baseline. There were no significant differences in BP measured in the clinic or at home among the three dietary periods. The protocol had more than 80% power to detect a mean effect of diet of 3 mm Hg systolic or 2 mm Hg diastolic BP. Therefore, replacing dietary saturated fat with carbohydrate or with linoleic acid does not affect BP in subjects with mild hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "By consensus, the most clinically important consequence of near drowning is hypoxemia. Whether it is due to physiologic shunting induced by diffuse alveolar flooding from saltwater aspiration or to diffuse atelectasis induced by surfactant inactivation from freshwater aspiration, both physiologic disturbances can be reversed with the institution of positive-pressure breathing in the form of PEEP or CPAP, which should be the mainstay of pulmonary management of respiratory insufficiency in these patients. The use of prophylactic antibiotics or corticosteroids as an adjunct in the management of pulmonary insufficiency resulting from near drowning is not warranted, may be detrimental, and remains controversial. The most crucial clinical consequence of the hypoxemia resulting from near drowning is cerebral injury and the consequent neurologic sequelae. The general consensus supported by large clinical studies is that near-drowning victims who, after initial resuscitation, are spontaneously breathing and are not comatose have a uniformly benign neurologic outcome. A significant subset of comatose near-drowning victims survive with eventually normal neurologic recovery when routine aggressive supportive intensive care is administered. Uncontrolled studies reporting improved outcomes with the institution of complex cerebral salvage techniques, such as induction of hypothermia, intracerebral pressure monitoring, induction of barbiturate coma, and the use of corticosteroids and osmotic diuretics, remain controversial. It is now clear that neither induced hypothermia nor barbiturate coma improves survival or neurologic outcome in these patients and may be detrimental.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Renal function and extracellular volume measurements were performed after 24 h, 4 days, and 7 days of HDT in conscious rats and compared with their own control measurements and to nontilted but similarly restrained rats. After 24 h HDT, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased 19 +/- 8% and renal plasma flow (RPF) increased 18 +/- 8% with increases in urine flow rate, Na+, and K+ excretion in conscious rats. These increases after 24 h were associated with an increase in extracellular volume of 16 +/- 3% (P less than 0.01). In the nontilted controls, there was a decrease in extracellular volume after 24 h of suspension. After 7 days of HDT, GFR was decreased by 7 +/- 1% (P less than 0.01), but RPF and extracellular fluid volume were not different from control values. However, RPF and GFR increased in the nontilted rats after 7 days. After 7 days of HDT renal micropuncture studies demonstrated that single-nephron filtration rate was also decreased from 43 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 3 nl/min (P less than 0.05) due solely to reductions in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (0.11 +/- 0.01 to 0.07 +/- 0.01 nl.s-1 X mmHg-1, P less than 0.05). There was a dissociation between GFR and water and Na+ excretion at days 4 and 7 of HDT not observed in the nontilt restraint controls.\r"

One of three infusions were started 20 min before birth: saline control (n = 10), saralasin (n = 5), or captopril (n = 6). Control lambs exhibited peak (means +/- SE) increases above fetal base line at 5 min after birth in plasma renin activity (5.0 +/- 1.1 to 11.0 +/- 3.4 ng.ml-1.h-1), angiotensin II (ANG II, 37 +/- 6 to 141 +/- 45 pg/ml) and total catecholamines (318 +/- 35 to 3,821 +/- 580 pg/ml). Mean systemic arterial pressure (Psa) and arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) increased more rapidly and to a greater extent by 1 h after birth in control lambs (Psa, 65 +/- 1 Torr; PaO2, 45 +/- 3 Torr) compared with the captopril group (Psa, 53 +/- 2 Torr; PaO2, 31 +/- 4 Torr) and the saralasin group (Psa, 56 +/- 2 Torr; PaO2, 27 +/- 3 Torr). Intravenous infusions of ANG II in control lambs, 2 h after birth resulted in a preferential systemic vs. pulmonary pressor response. The results demonstrate that at birth ANG II formation fosters the postnatal rise in Psa and PaO2, and high levels of circulating catecholamines may support postnatal cardiac output and Psa.\r"

Human test subjects were divided into a sedentary (n = 6) and active group (n = 5). Maximal uptake (VO2max) was determined at sea level and at high altitude (HA; 4,300 m) after acute (t less than 24 h) and chronic (t = 13 days) exposure. The VO2max of both groups decreased 32% with acute HA when compared with sea level. In the sedentary group, VO2max decreased an additional 16% after 13 days of continuous residence at 4,300 m, whereas VO2max in the active group showed no further change. In both sedentary and active subjects, plasma ammonia concentrations were increased (P less than 0.05) over resting levels immediately after submaximal exercise at sea level as well as during acute HA exposure. With chronic HA exposure, the active group showed no increase in plasma ammonia immediately after submaximal exercise, whereas the postexercise ammonia in the sedentary group was elevated but to a lesser extent than at sea level or with acute HA exposure. Thus postexercise plasma ammonia concentration was decreased with altitude acclimatization when compared with ammonia concentrations following exercise performed at the same relative intensity at sea level or acute HA. This decrease in ammonia accumulation may contribute to enhanced endurance performance and altered substrate utilization with exercise following acclimatization to altitude.\r"

The concentrations of the dye indicators were measured in the main pulmonary artery (fluoroscopically) and in a subpleural pulmonary arteriole (by fluorescence microscopy). The resulting concentration vs. time curves were subjected to numerical deconvolution and moment analysis to determine how the bolus was dispersed as it traveled through the arteriole stream tube from the main pulmonary artery to the arteriole. The mean transit time and standard deviation of the transport function from the main pulmonary artery to the arterioles studied averaged 1.94 and 1.23 s, respectively, and the relative dispersion (ratio of standard deviation to mean transit time) was approximately 64%. This relative dispersion is at least as large as those reported for the whole dog lung, indicating that relative to their respective mean transit times the dispersion upstream from the arterioles is comparable to that taking place in capillaries and/or veins. The standard deviations of the transport functions were proportional to their mean transit times. Thus the relative dispersion from the main pulmonary artery to the various arterioles studied was fairly consistent. However, there were variations in mean transit time even between closely adjacent arterioles, suggesting that variations in mean transit times between arteriole stream tubes also contribute to the dispersion in the pulmonary arterial tree.\r"

We also examined the influence of occluding some of the small pulmonary arteries with 58- to 548-micron-diam beads on the serotonin uptake and Qev. We found that, with the bead embolization, both the serotonin uptake and the Qev were reduced, whereas the change from zone 3 to 2 reduced serotonin uptake but did not change Qev. A plausible explanation for these observations is that the beads occluded vessels that were relatively large compared with those in which significant transvascular 3HOH exchange and serotonin uptake take place. Perfusion ceased in the collection of capillaries normally served by the obstructed arteries. Thus the extravascular water and the serotonin uptake sites downstream from the obstructions were not accessible to the indicators during the short time interval of the indicator passage through the lung. On the other hand, the change from zone 3 to zone 2 resulted in the collapse of small individual capillary segments within the alveolar vessel bed. Since the serotonin does not readily diffuse from the vessels through the tissue, it could not reach the endothelial cells of the collapsed capillaries. However, since the distances for diffusion between collapsed capillaries and neighboring perfused capillaries were small, the more highly diffusible 3HOH had access to the same Qev under both zone 2 and 3 conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infusions of isoproterenol were administered during brief peaks of bronchospasm produced by aerosolized methacholine and histamine, or during sustained bronchospasm produced by infused serotonin. In eight mongrel dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, the mean protection by infused isoproterenol against methacholine challenge decreased from 60.6 to 29.1% as the mean lung resistance (RL) was increased from 78 to 232% over base line by a fourfold increase in methacholine (P less than 0.002). In six dogs, the mean protection by isoproterenol against histamine decreased from 55.5 to 26.9% as the opposing RL increased from 80 to 182% over base line with a fourfold increase in histamine (P less than 0.02). However, with serotonin infusions there was only a small 18% mean decrease in protection (P = 0.05), associated with a correspondingly small 37% mean increase in dose of serotonin despite a 269% mean increase in resistance (P = 0.02). In all cases, the loss of protection correlated more closely with the dose of constrictant than the resistance increase over base line. These findings demonstrate in vivo functional antagonism between isoproterenol and the dose of bronchoconstrictant but not necessarily resistance increase per se.\r"

The first segment (S1) was from the main pulmonary artery to the site in the pulmonary veins corresponding to the pressure measured with a deflated and wedged 7-Fr Swan-Ganz catheter. The second segment (S2) was from the wedge pressure measurement site to the left atrium. Endotoxemia caused both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure to increase significantly during early (phase 1) and late (phase 2) periods of response; left atrial pressure was significantly decreased during both phases. Normalized cardiac output decreased significantly at 35 and 180 min but not at 240 min after starting endotoxin infusion. The calculated resistance of S1 significantly increased from a base-line value of 3.03 +/- 0.31 (cmH2O.1-1.min) to 7.60 +/- 0.71, 6.34 +/- 1.22, and 6.66 +/- 1.35 at 35, 180, and 240 min, respectively.

The calculated percent of total pulmonary resistance in S2 increased significantly from approximately 31 to 59% during phase 1 and remained significantly increased at 41% from 90 to 180 min after endotoxin.

  ".W": "Hormonal and substrate influences on in vivo cellular membrane function were evaluated in 15 healthy male volunteers. Each subject underwent serial evaluations of membrane function in the anterior tibialis muscle, as assessed by transcutaneous measurement of resting membrane potential (Em). Group A subjects (n = 9) underwent measurement of resting Em in the basal state and again during the 10th day of intravenous feeding (IVF). Group B subjects (n = 6) underwent measurement of resting Em in the basal state during epinephrine infusion and again during epinephrine infusion on the 7th day of IVF. Percutaneous needle biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle permitted calculation of transmembrane electrolyte distribution from the Nernst equation, using the measured Em and the chloride space method. Hospitalization with intake of a defined-formula enteral diet for 3 days resulted in depolarization (P less than 0.05) of resting Em (-75.3 +/- 1.6 mV) compared with normal (-79.8 +/- 0.9 mV). Despite 10 days of subsequent IVF, further depolarization (P less than 0.05) of resting Em (-71.2 +/- 1.2 mV) was observed. In the dual presence of IVF and exogenous epinephrine infusion, there was an increase (P less than 0.05) in intracellular potassium concentration and repolarization of resting Em (-80.6 +/- 0.8 mV) to normal levels. These data indicate that hormonal background and substrate availability contribute to the in vivo modulation of cellular membrane function in human skeletal muscle, possibly through facilitation of sodium-dependent amino acid transport across the cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 22 sheep with lymphatic cannulas were used to determine if 99mTc-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) clears directly from the air spaces of the lungs into the lymph vessels. Each sheep was anesthetized and ventilated with an aerosol of the DTPA for 2-5 min, and the DTPA activities in the lymph and plasma were measured every 15 min for 2 h. After the first 45 min, the average ratio of the DTPA in the lymph to that in the plasma (L/P) was 1.03 +/- 0.06 (SD) in the six control experiments and 1.11 +/- 0.05 in the six experiments in which the lungs were inflated with a positive end-expired pressure of 10 cmH2O throughout the study. Direct movement of the DTPA from the air spaces into the lymph was not necessary to account for the DTPA clearance in these experiments because the L/P ratio was not significantly different from 1.0. Eight additional sheep received intravenous infusions of air at 0.2 ml.kg-1.min-1 for 2 h to induce lung injury before depositing the DTPA. In these sheep L/P was 1.53 +/- 0.28, which was significantly higher than the value measured in the control group (P less than 0.01). We considered the possibility that the increased L/P ratio in these sheep could be due to alterations in the distribution of the blood flow to the tissue, but the L/P ratio in four sheep whose distribution of blood flow was altered by inflation of a balloon in the right pulmonary artery was 1.05 +/- 0.10, the same as the control value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88007216\r", 
  ".W": "Structures located near the ventral surface of the medulla (VMS) affect both cardiovascular tone and respiratory activity. In addition cooling the intermediate area of the VMS blocks the increases in parasympathetic activity and tracheal tone resulting from ventilation with hypercapnic or hypoxic gas mixtures, or due to stimulation of mechanoreceptors within the lung. Since cooling the surface of the VMS may affect fibers of passage as well as cell bodies, we performed studies in which pledgets containing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), a synthetic excitatory amino acid, were applied to intermediate area of the VMS. The studies were performed in chloralose-anesthetized, artificially ventilated cats. Application of pledgets containing NMDA (10(-7) mol at 10(-3) M) caused increases in tracheal pressure and the onset of phasic phrenic activity, but application of 10(-8) mol at 10(-4) M of NMDA could produce tracheal constriction without the appearance of phasic phrenic activity. Applying to the entire VMS either 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (2-APV, 10(-6) M), a specific antagonist to NMDA, or lidocaine (2%), a local anesthetic, 60 s before the application of pledgets containing NMDA, prevented the increase in tracheal tone and phasic phrenic activity. Intravenous administration of atropine methyl nitrate 0.5 mg/kg, a cholinergic antagonist, blocked tracheal responses to local application of pledgets containing NMDA but did not affect the increase in phasic phrenic nerve activity. These findings suggest that when stimulated, neurons near the surface of the VMS in the vicinity of the intermediate area increase the activity of parasympathetic fibers to the airway.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether epinephrine exerts an effect on glycogen metabolism in nonexercising (Non-Ex) as well as in exercising (Ex) skeletal muscle. Rats ran (15 m/min; 8% grade) on their forelimbs while their hindlimbs (Non-Ex) were suspended above the treadmill. Electromyographic records confirmed the lack of significant contractile activity in muscles during suspension. Plasma epinephrine levels were manipulated in three experimental groups (n = 20 for each group): adrenalectomized (ADX), intact adrenals (IA), and IA + epinephrine injection (+Ep). Another group of rats performed normal exercise on all four limbs (15 m/min; 8% grade). Muscle glycogen levels were measured in selected hindlimb muscles at t = 0 and after 90 min exercise (15 m/min; 8% grade) or suspended rest. In the absence of epinephrine (ADX), no glycogen loss was found (P greater than 0.05) in Non-Ex muscles during the exercise period. In the IA group (epinephrine levels elevated sixfold above basal at t = 90 min), glycogen levels in the nonexercising soleus, plantaris, and red and white gastrocnemius were significantly (P less than 0.05) depleted to 62 +/- 6, 67 +/- 6, 58 +/- 5, and 67 +/- 9% of control values, respectively. Similar decrements occurred in these muscles when exercise was performed on all four limbs (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that glycogenolysis occurs in nonexercising skeletal muscle independent of contractile activity, probably due to the effect of epinephrine. Furthermore, the present data strongly suggest that glycogen depletion patterns in muscles during exercise cannot be used as an index of motor unit recruitment.\r"

  ".W": "Use of a pulsed Doppler flowmeter to assess changes in blood flow resistance often requires a laborious series of calculations, and full characterization of resistance changes frequently necessitates replotting of calculated data. To facilitate the interpretation of pulsed Doppler flowmetry data, a simple, inexpensive device was constructed that computes the signal ratio of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to directional pulsed Doppler outputs. With this device, relative flow resistance can be recorded and quantitatively assessed at a glance in three vascular beds in real time. This computer-like device was designed around the Burr-Brown DIV100HP integrated circuit. C741G OpAmps provide input buffering, zeroing, and ranging adjustments enabling the user to accurately follow resistance over a very broad range of changes without exceeding the device's operating limits. A LM339 quad comparator monitors the input of each DIV100 and indicates when operating limits are exceeded via a channel-specific LED indicator and an audible alarm. No significant attenuation of the input signals occurs over the range of direct current to 50 kHz, and the output is without significant phase shift. Comparisons with calculated changes in resistance derived from the MAP and pulsed Doppler flowmetry in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats confirmed that resistance changes can be measured with precision and accuracy.\r"

  ".W": "Although the role played by the caudal ventrolateral medulla in the regulation of the cardiovascular system has been extensively investigated, little is known about the role played by this area in the regulation of airway caliber. Therefore, in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, we used both electrical and chemical means to stimulate the caudal ventrolateral medulla while we monitored changes in total lung resistance breath by breath. We found that electrical stimulation (25 microA) of 26 sites in this area significantly decreased total lung resistance from 7.1 +/- 0.4 to 5.7 +/- 0.3 cmH2O.1-1.s (P less than 0.001). The bronchodilation evoked by electrical stimulation was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade but was abolished by cholinergic blockade. In addition, chemical stimulation of seven sites in the caudal ventrolateral medulla with microinjections of DL-homocysteic acid (0.2 M; 66 nl), which stimulates cell bodies but not fibers of passage, also decreased total lung resistance from 8.3 +/- 1.1 to 6.5 +/- 0.8 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.01). In contrast, microinjections of DL-homocysteic acid into the nucleus ambiguus (n = 6) increased total lung resistance from 7.5 +/- 0.5 to 9.2 +/- 0.4 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the caudal ventrolateral medulla contains a pool of cell bodies whose excitation causes bronchodilation by withdrawing cholinergic input to airway smooth muscle.\r"

An identical defect was produced in the contralateral radius of each animal for use as a control. The defect on the control side was left unbridged or was bridged by large chips of autologous bone or an autologous inlay graft. All rats showed formation of new bone throughout the length of the radial defect only on the side in which the demineralized bone powder had been implanted. The control side, in which an autologous graft in the form of chips or inlay had been implanted, showed resorption of the graft. The maximum rate of formation of bone occurred fifteen to twenty-one days after implantation of the demineralized bone powder. At thirty-five days, the experimental defect was fully bridged, forming solid bone, in 71 per cent of the rats, and the remaining 29 per cent showed bridging of 95.8 per cent of the length of the defect, with union on one side. Analysis of the sequential radiographs, technetium-99m scans, and histological findings showed that the formation of bone and bridging of the defect were superior on the side in which the demineralized bone powder had been implanted compared with the side in which pieces of autologous bone or an autologous inlay graft had been used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Through a computer search of the medical literature and cross-referencing recent bibliographies, we were able to find 17 studies in which hypnotherapy was applied to the management of burns. The literature generally supports the efficacy of this approach to reduce burn pain; however, little else can be concluded from these studies. Several recent studies have applied hypnotherapy to aspects of burn care other than pain using excellent experimental designs. It is suggested that future studies of acute pain management follow suit.\r"

Of the 40 surgeons who performed more than ten operations in 1984, 95 per cent generally employed a screening technique which was less invasive than conventional angiography in their management. Techniques based on ultrasonography were more popular than those based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in this respect. If carotid endarterectomy were to be undertaken, 63 per cent of surgeons required pre-operative conventional angiograms. Of the 38 per cent who did not routinely use conventional angiography, all but one used digital subtraction angiography. Ultrasonography and DSA have had a significant impact on the management of carotid artery disease in Great Britain and Ireland and their individual places in such management are becoming clear.\r"

Mild glucose reduction [mean plasma glucose, 62 +/- 3 (+/- SEM) mg/dL (3.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/L)] was induced with an iv insulin infusion at the rate of 40 mU/kg.h for 180 min in 7 normal subjects. Despite a marked increase in mean plasma epinephrine concentrations, which peaked at 426 +/- 68 pm/mL (2325 +/- 371 pmol/mL; P less than 0.001), no significant differences in cognitive function occurred as determined by a series of trail-making tests compared with the results of serial tests in a group of 17 control subjects. In contrast, when hypoglycemia was induced (plasma glucose, less than 42 mg/dL; 2.3 mmol/L) by bolus injection of insulin in 4 normal subjects, cognitive function was impaired in every subject, as demonstrated by a delay in completion of the trail-making test. The mean completion time was prolonged to 107 +/- 16% of the baseline at the time of hypoglycemia vs. 74 +/- 4% in control subjects (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that cognitive function may be spared during mild plasma glucose reductions and is dissociated from the neuroendocrine adrenergic response that is activated under these conditions. This dissociation may be part of a homeostatic process in which overall brain function is maintained during glucoprivation, although counterregulation has already been triggered to prevent a further decrease in plasma glucose.\r"

Insulin secretion in response to arginine (2 mM), hyperglycemia (+100 mg/dl), and arginine plus hyperglycemia was evaluated. In diabetic compared with control animals three specific alterations were observed: (a) a deficient insulin response, in both first and second phases, to hyperglycemia; (b) an augmented insulin response to the potentiating effect of arginine under basal glycemic conditions; and (c) an inability of hyperglycemia to augment the potentiating effect of arginine above that observed under basal glycemic conditions. Normalization of the plasma glucose profile by phlorizin treatment in diabetic rats completely corrected all three beta cell abnormalities. These results indicate that chronic hyperglycemia can lead to a defect in in vivo insulin secretion which is reversible when normoglycemia is restored.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the role of angiotensin II in mediating the alterations in renal hemodynamics known to result from low protein feeding to normal rats by examining the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. 2 wk of low protein (6% casein) diet resulted in decreased glomerular filtration rate (normal protein [NP], 1.82 +/- 0.17 vs. low protein [LP], 0.76 +/- 0.01 ml/min; P less than 0.05) and renal plasma flow (NP, 6.7 +/- 0.2 vs. LP, 3.3 +/- 0.3 ml/min; P less than 0.05); renal vascular resistance rose (NP, 8.7 +/- 0.4 vs. LP, 19.8 +/- 1.4 dyn . s per cm5; P less than 0.05). These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma renin activity (NP, 7.0 +/- 0.7 vs. LP, 4.4 +/- 0.8 ng A I/ml per h; P less than 0.05), plasma aldosterone concentration (NP, 7.0 +/- 0.6 vs. LP, 4.1 +/- 0.7 ng/dl; P less than 0.05), and urinary PGE2 excretion (NP, 3,120 +/- 511 vs. LP, 648 +/- 95 pg/mgCr; P less than 0.05); by contrast renal renin content was significantly increased (NP, 2,587 +/- 273 vs. LP, 7,032 +/- 654 ng A I/mg protein; P less than 0.05). Treatment with captopril (30 mg/kg per d) raised glomerular filtration rate (GFR; LP + capt, 1.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min) and renal plasma flow (RPF; LP + capt, 6.7 +/- 0.7 ml/min), and reduced renal vascular resistance (LP + capt, 9.2 +/- 0.5 dyn/s per cm5) in low protein-fed animals. These values were not different from those measured in untreated and captopril-treated rats fed a normal (23%) protein diet. There were no changes in systemic mean arterial pressure in any group of rats. These data provide evidence that intrarenal angiotensin II mediates the changes in intrarenal hemodynamics induced by protein deprivation. The effects of low protein feeding may be partly potentiated by the reduction in PGE2 synthesis. However, the normalization of GFR and RPF in view of only modest increases in PGE2 excretion after captopril (LP, 648 +/- 95 vs. LP + capt, 1,131 +/- 82 pg/mgCr; P less than 0.05) suggests that if PGE2 is involved in these changes, it plays a permissive but not essential role in the increased renovascular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "We have tested the hypothesis that in vitro exposure of insulin-resistant adipocytes with insulin results in improved insulin action. A primary culture system of adipocytes from obese subjects with or without non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and nonobese control subjects has been developed. The adipocytes when cultured in serum-free medium do not lose their original characteristics in regard to insulin binding and glucose transport. The adipocytes from three groups were incubated with insulin (0, 10(-10) M, and 10(-7) M) for 24 h at 37 degrees C, receptor-bound insulin was dissociated, and basal and insulin (1 X 10(-11)-10(-7) M)-stimulated glucose transport and 125I-insulin binding were determined. The 24-h insulin exposure of adipocytes from control subjects decreased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The effects of 1 X 10(-7) M insulin were more pronounced than 1 X 10(-10) M insulin. Similarly, insulin exposure decreased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness of cultured adipocytes from obese and NIDDM patients. The insulin-induced reduction in insulin sensitivity and responsiveness for glucose transport in three groups were due to alterations at insulin binding and postbinding levels. In conclusion, insulin induces insulin resistance in control adipocytes and further worsens the insulin resistance of adipocytes from obese and NIDDM subjects. For insulin to improve the insulin resistance of adipocytes from NIDDM patients, either more prolonged in vitro insulin exposure and/or other hormonal factors might be required.\r"

The 7G8 strain invaded MkMk erythrocytes and neuraminidase-treated normal erythrocytes with greater than 50% the efficiency of normal erythrocytes. In contrast, the Camp strain invaded MkMk erythrocytes at 20% of control and neuraminidase-treated normal erythrocytes at only 1.8% of control. Invasion of MkMk erythrocytes by 7G8 parasites was unaffected by treatment with neuraminidase but was markedly reduced by treatment with trypsin. In contrast, invasion of MkMk cells by Camp parasites was markedly reduced by neuraminidase but was unaffected by trypsin. We conclude that the 7G8 and Camp strains differ in ligand requirements for invasion and that 7G8 requires a trypsin sensitive ligand distinct from glycophorins A and B.\r"

  ".W": "Concentrations of prostaglandins E2 and I2 may be decreased in preeclamptic and eclamptic pregnancies. Because these prostaglandins produce vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation it has been suggested that a reduction in their biosynthesis might play an important role in the pathogenesis of the hypertension and coagulation abnormalities associated with preeclampsia. Placental tissue is an extremely rich source of several enzymes that catalyze the catabolism of prostaglandins. The present study was initiated to determine whether one of these catabolic enzymes might be increased in preeclamptic/eclamptic pregnancies. The activities of the NAD- and the NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases were measured in 16 preeclamptics (mean diastolic pressure, 108 +/- 13 mmHg) and compared with 16 normotensive controls matched for age (20.8 +/- 5.43 vs. 20.6 +/- 5.16) and gestational week of delivery (34.6 +/- 5.40 vs. 35.0 +/- 5.06). These results indicate that the activity of the placental NAD-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase is elevated in preeclampsia (40.1 +/- 31.3 vs. 14.9 +/- 8.30 mU/g tissue, P less than 0.01). If this increase were also expressed in vivo, its effect on prostaglandin metabolism could be mistaken for impaired prostacyclin biosynthesis unless both the 6-keto- and 6,15-diketo-metabolites of prostacyclin were measured.\r"

  ".U": "88008374\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of systemic glucocorticoid treatment on early- and late-phase nasal allergic reactions after allergen challenge was determined in a double-blind, cross-over study in 13 allergic individuals. The subjects were pretreated for 2 d before challenge with 60 mg prednisone per day or a matching placebo. A previously described model using repeated nasal lavages for measuring mediator release in vivo was utilized. Symptom scores obtained repeatedly before, during, and after the challenge and the number and timing of sneezes were recorded. The mediators measured were histamine. N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase activity, kinins, PGD2, and LTC4/D4. Albumin was also measured as a marker of plasma transudation. Blood samples were taken for determination of total number of white blood cells, differential count, and total blood histamine content. No effect of steroid therapy was found on the appearance of symptoms or any of the mediators, except a reduction in kinins, in the early phase of the allergic reaction. However, in the late phase, the prednisone reduced the number of sneezes (P less than 0.01), as well as the level of histamine (P less than 0.05), TAME-esterase activity (P less than 0.05), kinins (P less than 0.05), and albumin (P less than 0.05). Only low levels of leukotrienes were found in the late phase, but the quantities of these mediators seemed to be decreased by the glucocorticoid treatment (P = 0.06). PGD2 did not increase during the LPR and thus was not affected by glucocorticosteroids. The immediate response to a second challenge 11 h after the first was also evaluated. Whereas the appearance of mediators was enhanced over the initial response to the same challenge dose in placebo-treated subjects, this enhancement was abrogated after prednisone treatment. As this dose of drug is known to be clinically effective in treating hay fever, the present study confirms the earlier findings of others that short-term systemic glucocorticoid treatment inhibits the late phase but not the immediate phase of antigen challenge. Furthermore, secondary enhancement of immediate responses is inhibited. This study shows that glucocorticoids inhibit the generation or release of inflammatory mediators during the late reaction and the physiologic response.\r"

Fasting adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity (ATLPL) decreased from 5.3 to 2.3 nEq FFA/10(6) cells per min (P less than 0.02) immediately after weight reduction, yet after weight maintenance, higher levels were again found (6.1 nEq FFA/10(6) cells per min). Although responsiveness of ATLPL to 40 mU/m2 per min of insulin infusion over 6 h was absent before weight loss, increases were seen immediately after weight loss (delta 0.8, P = 0.05) and more so (delta 7.7, P less than 0.01) after 3 mo. Moreover, whereas before weight loss the ATLPL response to ingested mixed meals (delta 0.9) was minimal, in the maintained reduced-obese state a marked increase was seen (delta 12.6, P = 0.02). Thus, because ATLPL is important to lipid filling in adipose tissue, the maintenance of high levels of fasting ATLPL and the increase in enzyme responsiveness in the reduced-obese state could play an important role in the resumption of the obese state, which so commonly follows weight reduction.\r"

The accuracy of this new technique was assessed in patients with chronic bronchial sepsis and was used to detect changes in the colonising microbial load of Haemophilus spp and Ps aeruginosa in patients with bronchiectasis receiving one of three different antibiotic regimens: intermittent seven day courses of amoxycillin for exacerbations; or a six month course of continuous oral or nebulised amoxycillin. The colonising microbial load of Haemophilus spp was reduced only temporarily (+++ to ++) after each intermittent course of antibiotic, but a sustained and greater reduction in the colonising microbial load of both Haemophilus spp (+++ to +) and antibiotic resistant P aeruginosa (+++ to +) was seen during both continuous treatments. Sputum purulence decreased in parallel with colonising microbial load, reflecting a reduction in host inflammatory response to the colonising microbial load.\r"

All lymphoid tumours expressed leucocyte common antigen, with B cell tumours staining with MB1 and MB2, and T cell tumours staining with MT1 and UCHL1. T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma all stained with MT1, but some were negative with UCHL1. B cell ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma also stained with MT1, but could be distinguished by its reactivity with MB1 and MB2. Reed-Sternberg cells did not stain with any reagent. Normal and neoplastic myeloid cells stained with MT1. Carcinomas stained with CAM 5.2 but were negative for lymphoid markers except MB2 staining in some cases.

Weaker acids (formic acid, acetic acid) and edetic acid decalcified more slowly and generally showed greater preservation of antigenic reactivity with better morphology and staining quality. Trichloracetic acid was also useful as a quick one step fixation and decalcifying agent for both cryostat and routinely processed sections.

Clinical studies have not yet proved the long-term wear resistance of these materials. However, they may be used if case selection and material selection are kept within certain guidelines. In terms of case selection, a composite resin might be used in areas of esthetic concern, or where minimal cavity preparation is possible. Resins might also be used in areas of low functional stress, and in premolars instead of molars. In selecting a material, the conventional resins should never be used for posterior teeth. Instead, a material with smaller, softer filler particles should be used. Also, light-cured materials are preferred to the self-cured types. Long-term clinical evaluation of the posterior composite resins is required before they can be accepted as a substitute for amalgam. If the problem of wear cannot be eliminated, but only reduced, then the effects of wear in terms of occlusal stability and function must be determined.\r"

Closed scaling and root planing has limitations as a definitive procedure for the removal of calculus from deep pockets and surgical treatment may be indicated for nonresponding sites. The condition of the tissue, not the probing depth, should dictate the course of action. During maintenance therapy all practitioners should recognize unsuccessfully treated or recurrent periodontitis and provide interceptive treatment to avoid a case of \"supervised neglect.\" Periodontal treatments should be provided by the general practitioner. This can result in improved oral health for the patients and constitute a professionally rewarding part of dental practice.\r"

Five hundred seventy-five patients undergoing single aortic or mitral valve replacement were randomized at surgery to one of the two valve types. At an average follow-up of 5 years (range 3 to 8) there are no statistically significant differences in survival between patients with the two valve types in the aortic valve replacement group. There is a statistically nonsignificant trend toward improved survival in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis compared with a mechanical prosthesis (5 year survival probability was 0.70 +/- 0.05 and 0.58 +/- 0.06, respectively). Fatal and nonfatal valve-related complications occurred significantly less frequently in patients with a bioprosthesis compared with a mechanical prosthesis for both mitral and aortic valve replacement. Five year complication-free probability was 0.67 +/- 0.05 and 0.45 +/- 0.06, respectively, for patients with mitral valve replacement and 0.63 +/- 0.04 and 0.53 +/- 0.04, respectively, for those with aortic valve replacement. The difference in overall complication rates was largely due to the increased number of clinically significant but nonfatal bleeding episodes in patients receiving a mechanical prosthesis. Adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics between patients receiving a mitral mechanical prosthesis and a mitral bioprosthesis reduced the statistical significance of the difference in both mortality and complications.\r"

The sensitivity of the visual and computer readings was 0.51 and 0.51, respectively, at a specificity of 0.87. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for the visual and computer ST depression in lead V5. Analysis of the areas under these curves showed no significant difference between them, indicating that computer-assisted analysis was not superior to unmodified visual analysis. A similar analysis was applied to two other computer indexes reported to be superior to visual assessments (treadmill exercise score and ST index). These computer indexes were not superior to a conventional visual analysis of leads I, II, V2, V4 and V5 in predicting severe disease (greater than 50% luminal narrowing). These results suggest that computer-assisted interpretation does not improve the accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in diagnosing coronary artery disease in subjects without prior myocardial infarction.\r"

Creatinine clearance increased or remained constant in 33 of the 59 patients (Group I), but declined in the remaining 26 patients (Group II). The two groups were similar with respect to the cause of heart failure, pretreatment renal function and all pretreatment hemodynamic variables. Patients in Group II, however, had lower values for serum sodium concentration (134.8 +/- 1.0 versus 137.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/liter) and higher values for plasma renin activity (10.6 +/- 3.4 versus 3.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml per hour), received larger doses of furosemide (108 +/- 11 versus 84 +/- 6 mg/day), were more frequently diabetic (42 versus 15%) and were more frequently treated with enalapril (50 versus 21%) than were patients in Group I (all p less than 0.05). By stepwise logistic analysis, only hyponatremia (or an elevated plasma renin activity) and enalapril therapy independently predicted the decline in creatinine clearance during converting enzyme inhibition. These observations could not be explained by changes in systemic blood pressure. In patients with a normal serum sodium concentration (greater than or equal to 137 mmol/liter), creatinine clearance increased with captopril (+21%, p less than 0.05), but not with enalapril (-6%, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During therapy, skeletal muscle blood flow at rest increased significantly from 1.5 +/- 0.6 to 2.6 +/- 1.0 ml/100 g per min (p less than 0.05), with a concomitant decrease in the femoral arteriovenous oxygen difference from 10.0 +/- 1.7 to 8.3 +/- 1.9 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Maximal VO2 increased significantly from 13.4 +/- 3.0 to 15.5 +/- 4.1 ml/kg per min (p less than 0.05). In four patients, the increase in maximal VO2 averaged 3.7 ml/kg per min (range 2.7 to 4.9), whereas in the remaining four patients, it was less than 1 ml/kg per min. Overall, peak skeletal muscle blood flow attained during exercise did not change significantly during long-term therapy with captopril (19.6 +/- 6.2 versus 27.6 +/- 14.3 ml/100 g per min, p = NS). However, the four patients with a significant increase in maximal VO2 experienced substantial increases in peak skeletal muscle blood flow and the latter changes were linearly correlated with changes in maximal VO2 (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). Femoral arteriovenous oxygen difference at peak exercise was unchanged (12.6 +/- 2.6 versus 12.6 +/- 2.4 ml/100 ml). Thus, improvement in maximal VO2 produced by long-term therapy with captopril is associated with an increased peripheral vasodilatory response to exercise, and this improvement only occurs when the peak blood flow is augmented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The valve dysfunction resulted from spontaneous cusp degeneration in 49 instances and from paravalvular regurgitation in 9. The pulsed Doppler study demonstrated regurgitant flow in 36 (92%) of 39 regurgitant valves and 8 (90%) of 9 paravalvular regurgitant valves. Diagnostic echocardiographic features were present in only 51 and 10% of the patients, respectively. Although the Doppler regurgitant jet was peripheral in seven of the nine patients with paravalvular regurgitation, it was not possible to differentiate these patients from those who had valve degeneration and cusp tear at the periphery of the valve ring. Eight patients presented with a musical holosystolic murmur of mitral insufficiency. In all eight there was a characteristic honking intonation on the audio signal and a striated shuddering appearance on the video Doppler signal. Ten stenotic mitral bioprosthetic valves (less than or equal to 1.1 cm2 valve orifice) were identified by Doppler study. Diagnostic echocardiographic features were present in only two of these patients. The Doppler-derived valve orifice dimension correlated well (r = 0.83) with cardiac catheterization values. Fourteen asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients had echocardiographically thickened mitral cusps (greater than or equal to 3 mm). These patients had a significantly (p less than 0.0001) smaller valve area as compared with normal control valves, and during 4 to 24 months of follow-up, five of these patients developed severe valve regurgitation or stenosis. Doppler ultrasound is more sensitive than echocardiography in diagnosing bioprosthetic valve stenosis and regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The important concept implicit in this formula is that the hemodynamic evaluation of a stenotic valve requires that the pressure gradient across that valve be examined in light of the cardiac output passing through the orifice. The concept asserts that if an accurately obtained pressure gradient can be related to an accurate cardiac output by an accurate formula, valve area can be determined. However, recent studies have demonstrated flaws in current practices for obtaining transvalvular gradients and cardiac outputs. Further, new data are available regarding the validation and possible changes in the Gorlin formula, validation and changes that the Gorlins noted might be necessary to make. These new data concerning the three basic requirements of an accurate valve area determination are the subject of this review.\r"

  ".W": "The Doppler determination of the mitral pressure half-time has gained widespread acceptance as a reliable estimate for mitral valve area, despite little theoretical basis for its \"independence\" of other hemodynamic variables. A simple model of the left atrium and mitral valve has been developed and a governing equation derived from fluid dynamics fundamentals. Solution of this equation indicates that the pressure half-time should vary inversely with mitral valve area, but also proportionally to net left atrial and ventricular compliance and to the square root of the peak transmitral gradient. This complex relation is apparently masked in the typical clinical situation because pressure and compliance tend to change in opposite directions, thereby partly offsetting each other. In several clinical settings, such as balloon mitral valvotomy, left ventricular hypertrophy and aortic regurgitation, changes in initial pressure and compliance may be large enough to alter the relation between mitral area and pressure half-time. This study reviews the development of the pressure half-time concept, presents an overall method for studying mitral valve flow using mathematical modeling and describes the effects of factors other than mitral valve area on pressure half-time.\r"

Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates stones in the gallbladder in approximately 98% of cases, but in only 15% in the common bile duct, whereas computerized tomography scan reveals them in greater than or equal to 50%. On cholangiography a blood clot (in hemobilia) may closely resemble a common duct stone, as may spasm or tumor of the distal duct. Iatrogenic stricture at the junction of the left and right hepatic ducts may be indistinguishable from a Klatskin tumor. Differentiation of extrahepatic from intrahepatic cholestasis is frequently impossible in needle specimens of the liver. Needle biopsy provides the best means of establishing a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. Laparoscopy is particularly valuable in the diagnosis of cirrhosis missed in blind biopsy specimens.\r"

Ulcer relapses were monitored by endoscopy at 6 and 12 months after inclusion and at symptomatic recurrence. The estimated proportion of relapse-free patients after 12 months follow-up in the psychological counseling group (0.43 +/- 0.08) did not differ significantly from the placebo group (0.47 +/- 0.07), whereas the corresponding value for the cimetidine group (0.70 +/- 0.07) was significantly higher (p less than 0.01). The effect of cimetidine on ulcer recurrence, however, was confined to smokers; relapse risk among nonsmokers did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. The negative outcome of psychological counseling raises doubts as to whether duodenal or prepyloric ulcer recurrences can be prevented by such a therapeutic approach.\r"

Social worth criteria constitute an expression of communal value and are prone to the evolution of communal sensitivities and to growth.\r"

On the basis of the relevant literature and the cases collected, it is appropriate to draw the following conclusions: 1) With present knowledge it is not possible to state whether retained barium plays any etiologic role in the development of subsequent uncomplicated acute appendicitis. 2) If a later appendicitis does supervene, it carries a high risk of being complicated; barium seems to be responsible for the complication. 3) The longer the interval between the barium study and the subsequent appearance of acute appendicitis, the higher will be the risk of complications.\r"

Abnormalities in levels of pepsinogen and its various isozymogens have been linked clinically, epidemiologically, and experimentally to peptic ulcer disease and gastric carcinoma. The ulcerogenesis of pepsin stems from its ability to breach gastroduodenal mucosal barriers. Furthermore, certain isozymogens seems abundant and hyperactive in patients with peptic ulcer disease. The etiology and significance of low pepsinogen levels with disproportionate elevations of pepsinogen II and pepsin 5 in gastric cancer and its precursors is less clear. Further exploration of the patho-physiologic role of pepsin is likely to be of considerable importance in initiating further advances in the understanding and treatment of upper gastrointestinal disease.\r"

The present studies assess the immunocompetence of allogeneic bone marrow chimeras established by reconstituting irradiated (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 (B6D2F1) mice with Leu-Leu-OMe-treated C57BL/6 (B6) bone marrow and spleen cells. Spleen cells from such chimeras were found to have normal B and T cell mitogenic responses. Furthermore, levels of natural-killer cell function were comparable to those observed in B6----B6 syngeneic radiation chimeras established without Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of donor cells. Spleen cells from B6----B6D2F1 mice were identical with B6----B6 or B6 mice in allostimulatory capacity and thus contained no discernible cells of non-H-2b phenotype. Whereas B6----B6D2F1 spleen cells demonstrated alloproliferative and allocytotoxic responses toward H-2k bearing spleen cells, no H-2d specific proliferative or cytotoxic responses could be elicited. B6----B6D2F1 spleen cells did not suppress the generation of anti-H-2d or anti-H-2k proliferative or cytotoxic responses from control B6 spleen cells. Furthermore, addition of rat concanavalin A supernatants did not reconstitute anti-H-2d responses of B6----B6D2F1 chimeric spleen cells. Thus, Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of B6 donor cells not only prevents lethal graft-vs-host disease, but also permits establishment of long-lived parent----F1 chimeras that are selectively tolerant of host H-2 disparate alloantigens, but fully immunocompetent with respect to natural killer cell function, B and T cell mitogenesis, and anti-third party alloresponsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we showed that major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) of MOPC-104E myeloma protein could only be induced in BALB/c or BAB-14 mice which have the ability to produce the CRI, but not in C.AL-20 or C.B-20 mice which have no ability to produce the CRI. The strong correlation between CRI-specific CTL responder strains and CRI producers supports the idea that the VH gene products are intrinsic primary antigenic stimuli for the generation of the anti-idiotypic CTL. To investigate the role of B lymphocytes in the selection of T lymphocyte repertoire, the purified B cells of CRI producer strains were repeatedly injected into anti-CRI CTL nonresponder neonatal mice. CRI-specific CTL activity was successfully induced in the CRI nonproducer mice only when they were exposed to CRI producer strain B lymphocytes from neonatal life. When the CTL nonresponder adult mice received CRI producer B lymphocytes, the nonresponder phenotype was not changed into the responder phenotype. Inducibility of CRI-specific CTL was also analyzed in tetraparental bone marrow chimeras. When CRI nonproducer bone marrow cells repopulated along with CRI producer bone marrow cells, the anti-CRI CTL of CRI nonproducer origin were generated. Adaptive differentiation of haplotype preference was also observed. When these observations are taken collectively, we see that the anti-idiotypic T lymphocyte repertoire is not a genetically determined one, but rather that the repertoire of T lymphocytes strongly depends on the postnatal selection process through the intrinsic idiotypic repertoire of B lymphocytes, i.e., internal images.\r"

Because at any one time these clones may be located in specific subregions of the thymus (specifically cortex only, medulla only, or cortex and medulla), we propose the hypothesis that different microenvironments in the thymus might, in fact, be responsible for the predominant maturation of different single positive mature thymic subsets.\r"

Tolerogen-specific mixed lymphocyte reactivity of lymphocytes obtained from 130 adult, class II tolerant mice, bearing a healthy skin allograft, was examined. Lymphocytes obtained from 86 mice responded to the tolerogen, in vitro, with a positive mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) indicating that a large proportion (75%) of adult class II tolerant mice on the A strain background are not clonally deleted for tolerogen-reactive lymphocytes. In addition, lymphocytes from 29 mice were MLR-negative to the tolerogen, and lymphocytes from 15 mice demonstrated such high amounts of proliferation to syngeneic stimulators that their specific response to the tolerogen could not be determined. In view of the discordance between the in vivo and in vitro expressions of tolerance in the MLR-positive mice, lymphocytes from these mice were compared with normal lymphocytes by several assays. 1) Tolerogen-specific proliferative responses obtained from both normal and tolerant lymphocytes could be inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibodies specific for the relevant class II antigens; 2) quantitative differences in the ability of normal, as compared with tolerant cells, to respond to the tolerogen in the MLR were not apparent; 3) no evidence of qualitative differences in the cell-surface phenotype of the proliferating cell was observed, (i.e., the cells were Thy-1+, L3T4+, Lyt-2-); and 4) lymphocytes from both normal and MLR-positive tolerant mice produced substantial amounts of interleukin-2 in response to the tolerogen. Thus, clonal deletion of helper cells is not required for tolerance to class II major histocompatibility complex antigens and we propose that tolerance may be maintained by either 1) in vivo suppression of the tolerogen-specific helper cells or 2) selective deletion or suppression of class II specific effector cells.\r"

We compared the fates of transplants between fully H-2 compatible (isografts) and H-2 incompatible (allografts) animals. Histologic evaluation comparing animals from iso- and allograft groups revealed significant differences in the number of inflammatory cells and in the degree of necrosis within the grafts. Response to allografted tissue within the brain mimics that seen in several immune-mediated diseases of the nervous system in that neurons appear to be selectively spared. Only upon subsequent stimulation of the host's immune system with an orthotopic skin graft bearing the major histocompatibility complex antigens of the neural graft are neurons destroyed. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that the inflammatory cell infiltrates in and around the allografts were composed of Lyt-2+, L3T4+, and Mac-1+ cells. In addition, Ia+ endothelial cells as well as Ia+ parenchymal CNS cells were found in both donor and host tissue of allografted animals. Hence, H-2 incompatible neural tissue transplanted to the CNS is recognized and rejected by the immune system of the recipient animal. The cellular infiltrates seen within the first weeks to months following transplantation of allogeneic CNS tissue resemble those seen in other allografts undergoing rejection. We conclude that the CNS is not unconditionally privileged as either a transplant site or as a source of transplanted tissue.\r"

  ".U": "88009093\r", 
  ".W": "The synthetic peptide CKS-17 has homology to a highly conserved region of the immunosuppressive retroviral envelope protein P15E, to envelope proteins of HTLV I, II, III, and to that encoded by an endogeneous C-type human retroviral DNA. CKS-17 inhibits the immune response of lymphocytes and the respiratory burst of human monocytes. Because P15E-related antigens are present in human malignant cell lines and cancerous effusions, we sought to determine the effect of CKS-17 on monocyte-mediated tumor cell lysis. Lysis of A375 tumor cells by lymphokine or lipopolysaccharide-activated human monocytes was inhibited by 10 microM CKS-17 (control, 79%; CKS-17-treated, 19%). Another synthesized peptide, CS-2, which has partial homology to CKS-17, failed to block monocyte-mediated killing. Thus, the inhibition by CKS-17 appeared to be specific. Because interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a cytocidal factor produced by activated monocytes, we also investigated the effect of CKS-17 on IL-1 production by monocytes and on direct IL-1-mediated cytotoxicity. CKS-17 did not block production or secretion of IL-1 by lipopolysaccharide- or interferon-gamma-activated monocytes. However, the direct cytocidal activity of both recombinant IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta against A375 tumor cells was blocked by CKS-17. The cytotoxic activity of IL-1 was inhibited by CKS-17 if (a) IL-1 was preincubated with CKS-17 for 1 hr at 37 degrees C or (b) the A375 cells were incubated with CKS-17 for 1 hr prior to the addition of IL-1. CKS-17 also blocked IL-1-induced proliferation of murine thymocytes, the D10 T cell line, and an IL-1-responsive astrocytoma cell line. These data suggest that CKS-17 may be a potent inhibitor of IL-1.\r"

  ".U": "88009130\r", 
  ".W": "We identified a patient (CAG) with scleroderma whose serum contained a high titer of IgG class antibodies that stained nucleoli in a pattern of independent tiny spots. When tested on isolated chromosomes, these antibodies selectively stained the nucleolus-organizing regions (NOR) of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. These staining patterns were not altered when substrate cells and chromosomes were treated with RNase, 0.1 M HC1, or 4 M urea, but they were abolished by treatment with DNase and trypsin. Immunoblots performed with serum CAG on isolated nucleolar substrates identified a protein antigen of approximately 90 kDa. Antibodies affinity-purified from this protein selectively stained nucleoli and NOR chromosomal regions. Therefore, this protein is the antigen that accounts for the ability of serum CAG to recognize the NOR. In a search for the NOR 90-kDa specificity among 254 patients with various rheumatic diseases, we found nine additional patients whose sera stained metaphase chromosomes selectively at the NOR. Sera from five of them (three with scleroderma, two of unknown diagnosis) recognized a protein that electrophoretically co-migrated with the CAG antigen. Thus, scleroderma is present in at least four of six who appear to have this specificity. We conclude that autoantibodies to the NOR 90-kDa antigen have an association with scleroderma and may be useful diagnostically and as a probe for further studies of the biology of the cell nucleolus.\r"

  ".U": "88009144\r", 
  ".W": "A recently established thymic stroma-derived cell line (TSCL) supported the growth of the interleukin (IL) 2-dependent, antigen-specific helper T cell (Th) clone, 9-16, without requirement for IL-2 and antigen, and such growth was substituted by a factor produced into cultures by this established TSCL. This substance, thymic stroma-derived T cell-growth factor (TSTGF), was capable of inducing the proliferation of various Th clones including 9-16 Th clone, but not of cytotoxic T cell clones. TSTGF-induced growth promotion was obtained in a dose-dependent fashion and in maintaining antigen specificity of Th clones. The culture supernatant from the TSCL did not contain detectable level of IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, or interferon activity. The proliferation of 9-16 Th clone was stimulated by recombinant IL-2 and IL-4 as well as TSTGF, but not by IL-1, IL-3, or interferons. However, the proliferation of this Th clone by IL-2 or IL-4 was almost completely inhibited by anti-IL-2 receptor or anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody, respectively, whereas TSTGF-induced growth of 9-16 Th clones was not affected by either type of antibody, demonstrating that TSTGF is functionally distinct from IL-2 and IL-4. In addition, TSTGF activity was also obtained from the culture supernatant of the primary thymic explant, which was freshly prepared. These results indicate that the primary thymic explant as well as an established TSCL produce factors capable of promoting the growth of helper but not cytotoxic type of T cells in the absence of T cell growth factors thus far defined.\r"

The inhibitory effect of anti-HLA class I mAb is specific, is not an Fc-mediated phenomenon, does not require accessory cells, and does not involve early stages of T cell activation. Distinct determinants of HLA class I antigens regulate T cell proliferation by different mechanisms, because the anti-HLA-A2, A28 mAb CR11-351, and the mAb W6/32 to a framework determinant of HLA class I antigens block interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion and IL-2 receptor expression, whereas the mAb CR10-215 to a monomorphic determinant blocks only IL-2 receptor expression. The mAb CR10-215 and W6/32 induced a 50% of maximal inhibition of T cell proliferation, when added after 27 and 12 hr, respectively, of incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with mAb OKT3. On the other hand, the mAb CR11-351 inhibited T cell proliferation even when added after 38 hr of incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with mAb OKT3 and was the only one to inhibit proliferation of cycling T lymphocytes. It is suggested that HLA class I antigens regulate T cell proliferation by interacting with cell-surface molecules involved in T cell activation. The differential inhibitory activity of the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies tested may reflect the different ability of the corresponding determinants to interact with activation molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the purified T lymphocyte glycoprotein, cluster differentiation 2 (CD2) (also known as T11, lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-2, and the erythrocyte (E) rosette receptor) interacts with the LFA-3 molecule on human E. We have examined the interaction of the purified CD2 molecule with the T11 target structure (T11TS) molecule on sheep E, and compared the two interactions. Purified, 125I-labeled CD2 bound to sheep E and the binding was inhibited by anti-T11TS monoclonal antibody (mAb). Reciprocally, the binding of T11TS mAb to sheep E was inhibited by pretreatment of sheep E with purified CD2. High concentrations of purified CD2 aggregated sheep E, possibly by inserting into the membrane, and the aggregation was inhibited by T11TS mAb. The affinity and number of binding sites for purified CD2 on sheep and human E was found to be similar, with Ka of 9 X 10(7)/M and 6 X 10(7)/M and 9800 and 8300 CD2 binding sites/E, respectively. Thus, the human T lymphocyte CD2 molecule is a receptor that cross-reacts between LFA-3 on human E and T11TS on sheep E, suggesting that LFA-3 and T11TS are functionally homologous ligands. As measured by saturation mAb binding, there are 8100 and 3900 ligand molecules/sheep and human E, respectively. Human and sheep E have surface areas of 145 and 54 micron 2, respectively. The 3.2- to 5.6-fold higher ligand density on sheep E appears to account for the ability of sheep but not human E to rosette with certain types of human T lymphocytes.\r"

Here we show that this functional cross-reactivity is most likely due to a structural homology of these molecules. A rabbit antiserum to sheep T11TS is shown to cross-react with LFA-3 in several independent assays: (a) rabbit anti-T11TS antiserum blocks the formation of E rosettes by human T cells with both autologous and xenogeneic (sheep) E by binding to the respective E; (b) the antiserum blocks the binding of anti-LFA-3 monoclonal antibody to human E; and (c) it reacts with purified LFA-3 in Western blotting. Together, these findings demonstrate that T11TS on sheep E and LFA-3 on human E are serologically related, providing further support for the notion that T11TS and LFA-3 are the sheep and human forms of the same cell interaction molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Using monoclonal anti-idiotopes with previously defined specificities for the variable (V) domain of HGAC 39, a monoclonal antibody against streptococcal group A carbohydrate (GAC), we have studied the effect of anti-idiotope on an anticarbohydrate immune response. Anti-IdI-3a and anti-IdI-3b are anti-idiotopes which recognize binding site-associated determinants, whereas anti-IdX recognizes a framework-associated determinant on the HGAC 39 V kappa domain. Each of three anti-idiotopes elicited a specific idiotope response, as measured by inhibition radioimmunoassay, in A/J and C57BL/6J mice. A single immunization with conjugated anti-IdI-3a elicited an idiotope(+), GAC-binding(+) response in C57BL/6J and (BALB/c X CBA/N)F1 male mice, but not in A/J or (CBA/N X BALB/c)F1 male, X-linked immunodeficient mice. When C57BL/6J mice immunized initially with anti-idiotope were further treated with group A vaccine, those receiving anti-IdX had the greatest increase in anti-GAC activity. Stimulation of an anticarbohydrate response with anti-idiotope may therefore be enhanced by selecting anti-idiotopes against both binding site- and framework-associated determinants.\r"

  ".U": "88009157\r", 
  ".W": "Using a 24-hr radiolabel microassay developed in our laboratory that measures [3H]glucose uptake in residual Candida, we have identified the effector cells responsible for in vitro inhibition of Candida albicans growth as mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes within the human peripheral blood cells. Highly purified T cells and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) that mediate natural killer activity which were obtained by Percoll density gradient centrifugation were found to have no innate activity against C. albicans. The LGL could not be activated by interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma or interleukin 2 to inhibit Candida growth although their K562 tumor cytotoxic activity was readily enhanced by these cytokines. Stimulation with heat-killed C. albicans also did not activate fungal growth inhibitory function in LGL and the supernatant of these activated LGL had no direct fungicidal activity. However, the activated LGL supernatant had the capability to enhance PMN function against C. albicans growth. Addition of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, affinity-purified interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma to PMN caused increased antifungal activity in PMN. However, antibodies to these cytokines had only a partial adverse effect on the ability of the activated LGL supernatant to stimulate PMN anti-Candida function. Therefore, the activated LGL supernatant appeared to contain a potent stimulator of PMN function which is as yet unidentified. These data indicate that LGL did not directly mediate anti-Candida activity but could indirectly influence C. albicans growth by activating PMN against the fungi through the release of a specific PMN-activating factor. Our findings therefore add another role to LGL which is the regulation of PMN function, the consequence of which is regulation of fungal immunity.\r"

  ".W": "When Plasmodium falciparum parasites are cultured with some immune sera, merozoites are agglutinated by antibodies to form immune clusters of merozoites and prevent their invasion into erythrocytes. Within these immune clusters of merozoites, several antigens that are normally found in the soluble fraction after detergent extraction accumulate in relatively insoluble immune complexes. From mice immunized with these immune complexes, we obtained hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that react with various immune clusters of merozoites antigens, including mAb 3D5, which recognizes a 101-kDa antigen (p101) and mAb, 5E3, which recognizes a 113-kDa antigen (p113). Both mAb reacted with antigens at the surface of schizonts, in the vacuolar space, and at the surface of merozoites before their release from schizont-infected cells. Both p101 and p113 were synthesized by mature trophozoites and young schizonts. In pulse-chase experiments, p113 was processed to 100-, 70-, 55-, and 50-kDa products. Both p101 and p113 appeared in the culture medium when schizont rupture occurred in normal culture medium but were found in immune complexes when schizont rupture occurred in the presence of immune serum. Antibodies in immune complexes, when dissociated with acid and used to probe immunoblots, reacted with affinity-purified p101 and p113. Antigens such as these, which are accessible at the parasite surface and react with antibodies present in immune serum that inhibits parasite invasion, are logical candidates to study in the search for a vaccine against the erythrocytic stages of malaria.\r"

Looking for differential responsiveness of potential pathogenetic significance, we have analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively the filaria-specific IgG subclass responses of 20 patients with lymphatic filariasis presenting either with chronic lymphatic obstructive pathology and elephantiasis (CP) or with asymptomatic microfilaremia (MF). Subclass-specific monoclonal antibodies were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study IgG filarial antibodies quantitatively and in immunoblot analyses to determine qualitatively the subclass antibody specificities. Quantitatively, the most significant differences among patient groups were in levels of IgG4, which were more than 17 times higher in MF patients (geometric mean, 64.7 micrograms/ml) than in those with CP (mean, 3.7 micrograms/ml). When qualitative analyses were done on the same sera, major differences were noted, particularly in the recognition profiles of the IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 responses. IgG1 and IgG3 responses to antigens were seen especially to antigens with m.w. greater than 68,000 in all patients with elephantiasis, whereas MF patients showed most of their reactivity to antigens less than 68,000. For IgG4, the MF patients showed prominent recognition of antigens throughout the entire range of m.w., whereas those with CP had very little IgG4 recognition of antigens of any m.w. Interestingly, this relationship was essentially reversed in the IgG3 antibody responses (especially to antigens greater than 68,000) and, to a lesser extent, the IgG1 responses. These findings demonstrate correlations of potential cause/effect significance between IgG4 antibody responsiveness and the immunomodulated asymptomatic MF form of clinical filariasis and between IgG3/IgG1 antibody responsiveness and the clinical presentation of CP.\r"

  ".W": "A rare D-region recombination event which gave rise to the B10.RQDB major histocompatibility complex haplotype has been examined to ascertain the nature of the crossover and to determine which class I genes are present in the new alignment of D-region genes. Serologic analysis have shown that the B10 . RQDB major histocompatibility complex recombinant mouse inherited the H-2Dd gene from the B10.T(6R) parental line and the H-2Db gene from the B10.A(2R) parental line, representing the first example of an intra-D-region crossover resulting from an intercross. Previous molecular genetic analyses of the d and b haplotypes revealed structural diversity in the organization of their D-region gene clusters. Hence, the D region is comprised of five class I genes in the d haplotype and only one in the b haplotype. Because allelic relationships among the various D-region genes are not defined, either a homologous or nonhomologous alignment of genes has generated the RQDB crossover. Therefore, the possibility that all three D-region antigen-presenting molecules (Dd, Ld, and Db) might be encoded by the RQDB haplotype was examined. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter and cytotoxic T lymphocyte analyses revealed no detectable levels of H-2Ld cell-surface expression, confirming earlier studies with antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and immunoprecipitation. Southern blot analysis localized the recombination point to within a 1-kb region at the centromeric end of the H-2Ld gene on the B10 . T(6R) chromosome in a region of high homology to the H-2Db gene on the B10 . A(2R) chromosome. Together, these studies define the D region of the RQDB haplotype as containing the five class I genes: Dd, D2d, D3d, D4d, and Db. In addition to providing insight into rare recombination events in the D region, the B10.RQDB mouse should be a useful tool for exploring the function of D-region genes.\r"

When administered prophylactically, purified LPS (as low as 4 ng/kg of mouse body weight) or antibody preparations contaminated with endotoxin (assayed by Limulus amoebocyte lysate test) were protective against lethal challenge with a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli (P less than .01). Antibodies that were nonreactive to LPS were similarly protective (P less than .001) when spiked with low doses of LPS (100 ng/mg of protein) but, as with LPS, were without effect when administered after infection. Endotoxin contamination of core-reactive antibody to LPS is mostly a problem associated with the large-scale production, purification, and concentration of the monoclonal antibody. The efficacy (as reported in studies in animal models of gram-negative bacterial sepsis) of antibody to LPS core is controversial. We suggest that endotoxin contamination is a likely factor in this controversy.\r"

Intact cells of S20323 grown in a high osmolality medium hydrolyzed cephalosporin substrates much more slowly than did intact cells of S17069 at low substrate concentrations, a result indicating slower diffusion of cephalosporins into S20323. In low osmolality media, S17069 produced both OmpF and OmpC porins; S20323 produced only OmpF porin. In high osmolality media with osmotic activity similar to that in the patient's tissues, synthesis of the OmpF porin was repressed in both strains and left S20323 with undetectably low levels of any porin. The increased beta-lactam resistance in S20323 is apparently a consequence of the loss of the OmpC porin.\r"

  ".W": "We have defined major differences between events elicited during activation of human neutrophils by opsonized Candida hyphae (noningestible) or zymosan (ingestible) and by unopsonized Candida hyphae (also noningestible). In response to opsonized particles, a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium was initially observed, followed by depolarization in the transmembrane potential and a respiratory burst. Without opsonins, zymosan did not elicit a response from neutrophils. In contrast, unopsonized Candida hyphae elicited a transient increase in cytosolic calcium, as well as triggered a respiratory burst; they did not, however, elicit a depolarization of the neutrophil membrane. Furthermore, the rate of superoxide generation decreased after a prolonged lag period. The calcium flux was also delayed and coincided with the onset of superoxide generation. Thus, our data demonstrate that Candida albicans hyphae activate neutrophils in the absence of added serum components and initiate a neutrophil respiratory burst without an antecedent membrane depolarization.\r"

All isolates had measurable, consistent BH-P secretion, and most also showed detectable BSA-P activity. However, isolates from patients were more proteolytic than those from carriers, with the difference being statistically highly significant. When the patients with vaginitis were categorized according to signs and symptoms, the highest BH-P values were recorded for those with full symptomatology, whereas the only BSA-P-negative isolates were from the group without vaginitis. Isolates from the patient and carrier groups did not differ as a whole in their growth potential in vitro, and all were germ tube responders in serum, independent of their source.\r"

A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that ibuprofen (10 mg/kg), a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, administered 30 min before amphotericin B administration reduced the incidence of chilling from 87% to 49% (P = .01); the incidence of chilling reactions considered severe was reduced from 69% to 15% (P = .008). We postulate that the chills and fever produced by an infusion of amphotericin B are mediated through prostaglandin E2 synthesis.

Immunologically related molecules with the same molecular weight were identified by polyclonal antibodies in strains HM1:IMSS, Entamoeba invadens, and Entamoeba histolytica Laredo. Six monoclonal antibodies recognized only the 220-kDa protein present in strains HM38 and HM1, a result indicating the presence of similar epitopes in the proteins from virulent strains isolated from humans. All the antibodies against the 220-kDa protein have the following properties: (1) they bind to the plasma membrane of live or fixed trophozoites, (2) they partially inhibit the adhesion of trophozoites to erythrocytes and cultured cells, and (3) they inhibit erythrophagocytosis.\r"

Preliminary characterization revealed the following characteristics: by Amicon ultrafiltration, fractions greater than 100,000 daltons were shown to have biologic activity; chromatofocusing of these active fractions revealed a peak of activity associated with fractions having pH 4; heating to 100 degrees C for 10 minutes abolished almost all activity, whereas trypsin treatment was without effect.

After a 24-week treatment period, patients taking captopril, compared with patients taking methyldopa and propranolol, scored significantly higher on measures of well-being and vitality. In addition, patients on captopril had more favorable results in being able to keep up with their work and in not feeling tired or sleepy at work. The effects of each of the drugs manifested themselves at different periods. For example, the negative effects of methyldopa on vitality were evident by week 8, whereas the negative effects did not become manifest for propranolol until week 24. On the other hand, a steady progressive improvement in vitality scores was evident at week 8 and at week 24 for patients on captopril. The findings of the study also suggest that the effects of the treatment drugs were most marked in patients who had had previous antihypertensive medications and who were on single-drug therapy during the course of the clinical trial. Further, the differences between patients taking captopril and those on methyldopa and propranolol appear to be obscured by the addition of a diuretic. The findings of the study may guide the physician in orienting his or her patient and in planning and implementing a therapeutic regimen.\r"

Few patients, however, were completely well at 5 years and over half had received further treatment for agoraphobia during the follow-up. Patients who were still highly phobic at the end of the clinical trial were more often prescribed psychotropic medication during follow-up and remained phobic at 5 years. Phobic improvement had generalized more in those patients with very low than in those with moderate pretreatment Hamilton depression scores. Frequency of initial spontaneous panics did not predict outcome. Improvement in agoraphobia was associated with improved marital adjustment.

Twelve of the schwannomas, including both intracerebral tumors, two of the neurofibromas and none of the neuromas immunostained with PVAS. Except for one schwannoma, all the PVAS-positive tumors were positive with two of the MAb preparations. While both of the intracerebral schwannomas were positive with the third MAb, none of the extracerebral tumors were. Our results suggest that: 1) human nerve sheath tumors contain cells having polypeptides that share epitopes with GFA protein, but 2) these polypeptides differ from astrocytic GFA protein by at least one epitope, and 3) the location of the tumors in relation to the central nervous system may influence GFA protein immunoreactivity.\r"

This method is entirely atraumatic and in contrast to angiography allows investigation of asymptomatic patients and provides more representative data for epidemiological studies. The incidence of subclavian stenosis or occlusion was 1.15% among the 23,500 patients examined in our department between 1978 and 1985. Of the 272 patients with unilateral or bilateral subclavian stenosis or occlusion, 54% were asymptomatic with no subjective complaints and were normal upon neurological examination; 29% reported vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), with or without concomitant TIAs or infarction in the vascular territory of the carotid arteries; and 17% complained of symptoms exclusively referring to the region of carotid blood supply. Reversal of blood flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery was detected in 152 patients (56%). The incidence of neurological symptoms within this group was double that found in patients without steal. None of the patients suffered from permanent vertebrobasilar damage. In most cases, subclavian artery disease was due to atherosclerosis. For 13 patients an inflammatory, iatrogenic, traumatic, or congenital aetiology could be assumed. The marked preponderance of left-sided subclavian stenosis or occlusion, reported by others, could be confirmed among our patients, but was less pronounced for tight stenoses than for occlusions. Mild-to-moderate subclavian stenoses were about equally distributed on each side.\r"

Patients with four or more positive nodes or at least one positive apical node were randomized to receive either five or ten cycles of cyclophosphamide/Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (CA) and patients with one to three positive nodes or operable tumors larger than 5 cm and pathologically negative nodes were randomized to receive eight cycles of either cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (CMF) or methotrexate and 5-FU (MF) chemotherapy. Two hundred six of these patients were subsequently rerandomized to receive either no further treatment or adjuvant radiotherapy. Thirty-five patients withdrew after randomization, including 34 who declined to receive radiotherapy. Radiation therapy consisted of 4,500 cGy in 5 weeks to the chest wall and appropriate draining lymph nodes. Median follow-up from chemotherapy randomization is 45 months for patients in the CA arm and 53 months for those in the CMF/MF arm. The crude rate of local failure (chest wall or draining lymph node areas) as first site of failure for patients randomized to receive chemotherapy only was 14%; for those randomized to receive both chemotherapy and radiotherapy it was 5% (P = .03). For patients in the CMF/MF arm, the rate of local failure as the first site of failure was nearly the same for patients randomized to chemotherapy only as for those randomized to adjuvant radiotherapy as well (5% v 2%). For patients in the CA arm, the crude rate of local failure was 20% for patients randomized to receive chemotherapy only, and 6% for those randomized to both types of adjuvant treatment (P = .03). Among the 43 patients treated with CA who actually received radiotherapy, there was only one local failure, compared with 12 local failures among the 59 patients (20%) who actually did not receive radiotherapy (P = .007). No significant difference was seen in disease-free survival or overall survival in either the CA or the CMF/MF arm between patients randomized to receive radiation therapy and those randomized to no further treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-four previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma were prospectively randomized into one of three treatment regimens: (1) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 450 mg/m2 as an intravenous (IV) bolus daily for five days or toxicity, then 200 mg/m2 IV bolus every other day for six doses; (2) methotrexate (MTX) 50 mg/m2 in normal saline by IV infusion over four hours followed by an IV bolus of 5-FU 600 mg/m2. This was administered weekly for 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks. (3) Leucovorin 500 mg/m2 in a two-hour IV infusion of normal saline with 5-FU 600 mg/m2 as an IV bolus one hour after the Leucovorin began every week for 6 weeks. The combined complete and partial response rates in the three regimens were 11%, 5%, and 48%, respectively (P = .0009). The median duration of response in the 5-FU and Leucovorin regimen was 10 months. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment regimens with respect to survival time (P = .6). Toxicity in the 5-FU and Leucovorin regimen was predominantly diarrhea (13 of 30 patients, 40%). In this regimen, eight of 13 patients (52%) who developed diarrhea not only required a dose reduction of 5-FU, but also hospitalization for IV hydration. The predominant toxicity in the 5-FU alone regimen and the 5-FU and MTX regimen was leukopenia. One drug-related death occurred in each regimen.\r"

These patients were treated with a variety of new modalities, particularly radiolabeled antiferritin antibodies. Following treatment, seven of the 11 patients were considered to have converted their lesions to possible resectability. Six patients had complete resections, and one patient was partially resected. All patients had the common features of either nodular massive or nodular multifocal hepatocellular cancer. Relative to the patient's initial status, the quality of life remains high, and a new approach in the treatment of the nodular form of nonresectable hepatoma has been demonstrated. The present rate of such conversion to resectability is unknown. However, with further advances in radiolabeled antibody therapy, these results offer a new opportunity in the management of hepatocellular cancer.\r"

Mediastinal irradiation using 50 Gy in 25 fractions was given to all limited-stage patients with a complete (CR) or partial response (PR) after three chemotherapy courses. Cranial irradiation was administered to all patients with CR. Objective responses were seen in 77% (CR 40%, PR 37%) of patients with limited-stage and 58% (CR, 9%; PR, 49%) with extensive-stage disease. Median relapse-free survival for objective responders with limited stage was 14.6 months and 7.9 months for extensive-stage patients. Median relapse-free survival following CR was 15.4 months and 8.5 months for PR. Median survival was 15.3 months for limited-stage and 8.1 months for extensive-stage patients. The combination was well tolerated with mild nausea or less (World Health Organization [WHO] grade 0 or 1) in 62% of patients and minimal mucositis, renal, neurotoxicity, or ototoxicity. Neutropenia less than 1.0 X 10(9)/L (WHO grade 3 or 4) was seen in 63% of patients, with two deaths from infection while neutropenic. The combination of carboplatin and VP-16-213 is a new, active program with low toxicity when applied intensively in previously untreated patients with small-cell lung cancer.\r"

Nephrotoxicity was minimal. Ototoxicity was dose limiting in two patients. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in only one patient, but few patients received multiple courses of therapy. Six partial responses (PR) were observed in 47 patients, including two patients with refractory breast cancer and four with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck origin. Two of the four patients with head and neck cancer had been previously treated with conventional doses of CDDP, suggesting a possible dose-response phenomenon in this disease. The saline infusion was well tolerated by older patients, suggesting that this method of administration can be safely used in those CDDP-sensitive malignancies that occur in older patients.\r"

After chemotherapy, patients underwent surgery if the tumor was resectable for cure, (unless the operation involved total laryngectomy), and/or locoregional radiation therapy. Twelve patients (24%) achieved CR and 23 (45%) partial remission (PR) for an overall response rate of 69%. Thirty-nine of the 51 patients are evaluable following chemotherapy and locoregional treatment, and 28 (72%) have achieved disease-free status. Seven of these 28 (25%) have subsequently relapsed. Eleven of the 51 patients (22%) have died at median follow-up of 10+ months (3+ to 24+). Nausea and vomiting (94%) was the most severe acute toxicity. Myelosuppression was mild and nephrotoxicity was effectively prevented by the 3% saline diuresis. Bleomycin was withheld in 12 of 49 (24%) because of deterioration in pulmonary function tests. Ototoxicity in 12 of 49 (25%) and neurotoxicity in 19 of 49 (39%) were the most significant long-term toxicities. Very-high-dose cisplatin and bleomycin in this study was an effective chemotherapy regimen, but not more so than more conventional doses of cisplatin. Toxicity from both drugs was significant.\r"

  ".W": "The current status of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had developed CNS disease while being treated on protocol CCG-101 was investigated. Seven hundred thirty-six eligible patients were entered into the study between June 1972 and July 1974. All children who were greater than 18 months of age were eligible for randomization to a CNS prophylaxis trial for which one regimen gave only a short course of intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) as prophylaxis. All other regimens included radiation therapy as prophylaxis. Current follow-up (median, greater than 10 years) shows no significant difference by standard life-table analysis for ultimate survival, although a substantial excess of CNS episodes occurred on the IT MTX regimen. Of the 675 patients who completed induction therapy and achieved remission in the study, 100 (14.8%) developed CNS disease as the first evidence of relapse. Fifty-five of these 100 had no subsequent CNS episodes. Only 17 of these 55 patients are surviving without further relapses since the CNS episode. The median time to isolated CNS relapse was 457 days. Time to the initial CNS relapse was found to be the most important factor for predicting outcome. Thirty-five of the 55 patients with isolated relapse subsequently relapsed in the bone marrow, and of these, 32 have died. Twenty patients of the 100 with CNS disease as the first evidence of relapse developed two episodes of CNS involvement and 17 of these 20 patients subsequently relapsed in the bone marrow; only one patient survived. Twenty-five patients of the 100 have shown a pattern of chronic CNS disease with multiple CNS relapses. The overall disease-free survival for the 100 patients who developed one or more relapse was only 16%. These data demonstrate that the occurrence of a CNS relapse is an indicator of poor subsequent outcome. Comparison of results of groups receiving different CNS prophylaxis required careful consideration of the entire pattern of relapses and mortality.\r"

Most patients received intrathecal hydrocortisone (HC) each treatment to minimize arachnoiditis. Overall response was 55%. Seven patients achieved complete response. Response to MTX was superior to combined MTX/Ara-C, but not significantly so (61% v 45%; P greater than .10). Response was more frequent if drugs were administered via Ommaya reservoir than by lumbar puncture (65% v 48%; P greater than .10). Concurrent radiotherapy to the CNS was associated with significantly better response (73% v 35%; P less than .05). Small-cell lung carcinoma patients showed the best response (69%). Overall median survival for the whole group was 8 weeks, but responders fared better than nonresponders (median survival, 18 v 7 weeks; P less than .05). Nausea and vomiting were the most common toxicities encountered (45%), but rarely proved limiting. An unusual, previously undocumented reaction to intrathecal HC was noted. MTX is moderately effective in nonleukemic meningeal carcinomatosis, but the addition of Ara-C does not appear to improve results. Pretreatment factors did not predict outcome in this trial.\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous transforming virus of the herpes group showing tropism for B lymphocytes. Primary infection in normal hosts results in a transient lymphoproliferative disorder, acute infectious mononucleosis (IM), that is restricted by cytotoxic and suppressive lymphocytes. However, in the immunodeficient host, EBV-induced lymphoproliferation may behave in a biologically malignant fashion. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies and those with immune incompetence resulting from suppressive therapy in allograft transplantation or infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have EBV-related illness ranging from fulminant mononucleosis and invasive polyclonal B cell hyperplasia to monoclonal B cell malignancies. While the direct link between EBV and malignant B cell proliferation in these patients has not been elucidated, the association has been increasingly recognized with improved techniques of viral detection. Clinical management can be guided by the location and extent of tumor, histologic features, and clonality. Regional and node-based polyclonal proliferations may respond to prompt reduction of immunosuppressive therapy and efforts to interrupt the replicative cycle with antiviral agents. Systemic cytotoxic therapy often leads to further immunosuppression and should be reserved for patients with progressive disease, advanced visceral involvement, and monoclonal lymphoid malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The use of flow cytometry to analyze the cellular DNA content of human malignancies has become increasingly commonplace. The relationship between abnormalities in DNA content or proliferative characteristics and prognosis is becoming clear for a variety of malignancies in part through new techniques that permit analysis of archival material. High- and low-risk groups of patients with early breast and bladder carcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, and colorectal, ovarian, and cervical carcinoma can be distinguished on the basis of abnormal stemline DNA content. In several hematologic and common pediatric malignancies, the prognostic relevance of DNA content flow cytometry has been similarly established. Though the interpretation of tumor cell cycle analyses is less certain, this characteristic may also be prognostically important. However, generalizations cannot be made when applying flow cytometric DNA analysis to clinical decision making. The prognostic importance of an abnormal DNA histogram for an individual patient must be assessed on the basis of the relevant data base for that particular tumor type. The current extent of this data base for various malignancies is reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to investigate the effects of low dietary zinc, copper or selenium intake of certain types of stress and of injection of zinc, copper or cadmium on metallothionein I (MT-I) concentrations in the blood and urine of rats. The aim was to establish whether such measurements could be of value in the diagnosis of zinc deficiency. Marginal zinc deficiency rapidly caused a major decrease in MT-I levels in the blood cells and to a lesser extent in urine. Injection of zinc and also of cadmium and copper had the opposite effect and increased MT-I concentrations in both samples, although the effects of zinc on blood cells and urine were relatively transient. The MT-I in the blood cells was associated mainly with the erythrocytes. No changes in blood or urine MT-I levels were found in copper- and selenium-deficient rats. Neither cold stress nor restriction of food intake for 24 h had any significant effect on MT-I levels in the blood cells or urine. Endotoxin injection increased urinary MT-I excretion in both zinc-adequate and zinc-deficient rats but did not affect blood cell MT-I levels in either group of animals. It appears therefore that assay of erythrocyte MT levels could be of particular value in the diagnosis of zinc deficiency, especially when it is accompanied by stress or infection.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of an immune response on growth and feed efficiency in chicks and the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and corticosterone (Cort) as mediators of the response were investigated. Daily injections of either sheep red blood cells or the inflammatory agent Sephadex resulted in significantly (P less than 0.05) lower rates of weight gain, feed intake and efficiency of feed utilization than controls fed ad libitum, indicating an immunologically mediated stress. Feeding control chicks the same amount of diet as that consumed by immunologically challenged chicks did not completely equalize rates of weight gain. Injections of a crude preparation of IL-1, but not Cort, resulted in weight gain, feed intake and efficiency of feed utilization that were similar to those of immunologically challenged chicks. The concentrations of IL-1 and Cort, measured by bioassay and radioimmunoassay, respectively, in serum from immunologically challenged chicks were significantly higher than in nonchallenged chicks. To determine the influence of IL-1 and Cort on protein accretion in skeletal muscles, the extensor digiti communus and ulnaris lateralis were incubated in the presence of these two hormones at concentrations similar to that seen in serum after an immunologic challenge. Cort did not affect the rate of protein degradation but resulted in rates of protein synthesis that were significantly lower than controls. IL-1 did not affect the rate of protein synthesis but resulted in rates of protein degradation that were about 24% greater than controls.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to present the anatomy, indications, and surgical technique of cricothyroidostomy. It is concluded that cricothyroidostomy, and not tracheostomy, is the preferred procedure for surgical establishment of an upper airway, either in elective maxillofacial surgical procedures, or in an emergency situation.\r"

The 117 patients who received transplants were grouped according to severity of disease and degree of general decompensation at the time of transplantation. The severity of a patient's medical condition with the possible exception of deep hepatic coma, did not predict outcome following orthotopic liver transplantation. Seventy variables were assessed at the time of the evaluation. Twenty-three of the 70 variables were found to have prognostic significance with regard to death from progressive liver disease before transplantation. These 23 variables were incorporated into a multivariate model to provide a means of determining the relative risk of death among pediatric patients with end-stage liver disease. This information may allow more informed selection of candidates awaiting liver transplantation.\r"

The mean fecal split fat/total fat ratio, which generally reflects bile acid-related fat malabsorption, was also unchanged. Linoleic and arachidonic acid deficiencies noted in plasma before supplementation showed no significant improvement with taurine supplementation. Likewise, plasma/serum vitamin A, E, and D levels were unchanged. Standard scores for height and weight were not affected significantly. This study does not support the use of taurine supplementation in the nutritional management of CF.\r"

Other aspects of the 2-week treatment were constant. The two therapy groups were comparable in all aspects. At the completion of therapy, the addition of aerosolized amikacin produced temporary eradication of P. aeruginosa in 70% of the patients, compared with 41% in the intravenous therapy only group (P less than 0.02). Suppression of P. aeruginosa in sputum cultures was correlated with the amikacin sputum concentrations. However, both regimens resulted in similar improvements in clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and pulmonary function measurements, and within 4 to 6 weeks most patients were recolonized with P. aeruginosa. There was no serious toxicity or adverse effect. In patients with cystic fibrosis, the addition of aerosol aminoglycoside to systemic antipseudomonal combination therapy is not clinically beneficial.\r"

Drugs were given 10 min before each session in a two-lever, food-reinforced (FR 30) drug discrimination paradigm. SKF (2.0-8.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-related increase in drug-appropriate responding in the SKF group but not in the PIR group. PIR (0.06-1.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-related increase in drug-appropriate responding in the PIR group but not in the SKF group. Apomorphine (0.03-0.5 mg/kg i.p. also produced a dose-related increase in PIR-appropriate responding, whereas dopamine (DA; 4.0-16 mg/kg i.p.), which does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, did not. When pretreatment time was varied, SKF-appropriate responding was maximal when 8.0 mg/kg of SKF was injected 30 min before the session. PIR (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) occasioned maximal PIR-appropriate responding when injected 1 or 10 min before the session but did not when injected 30 or 60 min before the session. In rats trained to discriminate SKF (8.0 mg/kg) using a 30-min pretreatment time, the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 blocked the SKF discriminative stimulus (DS) but did not alter the PIR DS in PIR-trained rats. The D2 antagonist pimozide blocked the PIR DS but did not alter the SKF DS. Thus, the DS properties of D1 and D2 agonists are functionally distinct in rats and are antagonized by DA antagonists selective for D1 or D2 receptors, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

FHR, FBMs and FTMs were recorded concurrently using abdominal electrocardiography and real-time ultrasonography and entered on line into a microcomputer. Offline data analysis provided mean 30-minute baseline FHRs, acceleration counts, FBM incidences, FBM rates and FTM incidences. Both groups were similar for gestational age, birth weight and perinatal outcomes. Mean 30-minute FHR baseline was unchanged and similar in both groups. Mean 30-minute FHR acceleration counts and FTM incidences were significantly higher in group F, while FBM incidences and rates were significantly higher in group G. While biophysical testing can be conducted under either set of maternal conditions, different normal standards must be employed, test length must be sufficient to account for normal biologic variations, and biophysical parameters must be monitored concurrently.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain the margin of error using this technique among 23 term and postterm women. The AFI was obtained using linear array real-time B-scan ultrasound to measure the vertical diameter of the largest amniotic fluid pocket in each of the four quadrants. The sum of these measurements was expressed as the AFI. Eight women underwent ten consecutive AFI measurements by the same sonographer to determine intraobserver variation. Interobserver variation between five sonographers was measured by assessing the AFI in 15 additional patients. With the amniotic fluid volume in the low or normal range, our results demonstrated the intraobserver and interobserver variations in AFI to average 1.0 and 2.0 cm, respectively. With an above-normal amniotic fluid volume, a 2.5- to 3-fold greater variation was observed. A relatively small margin of error appears to exist between observers using the four-quadrant technique to assess amniotic fluid volume.\r"

The amniotic fluid index (AFI), or four-quadrant technique, has been suggested for this purpose. While previous reports have outlined this technique and correlated the results with pregnancy outcome, none have reviewed the changes in AFI throughout pregnancy. We studied AFI changes from 11 through 43 weeks' gestation. As part of the entry criteria, only patients with good dates were evaluated. The AFI was determined by the summation of the vertical diameter of the largest pocket in each of the four quadrants. All amniotic fluid studies were conducted using real-time linear array B-scan. During the study period, 197 patients with good dates confirmed clinically and sonographically underwent 262 AFI assessments. From 11 to 26 weeks the AFI rose progressively. Thereafter until term, the AFI remained approximately 16.2 +/- 5.3 cm. After 38 weeks the AFI appeared to gradually decline. Data obtained from this study population corroborate previously defined normal amniotic fluid volumes. These results also suggest that serial measurements of the AFI may be an effective means of assessing fetal status throughout pregnancy.\r"

A standardized rating scheme and computerized information bank will allow more rapid analysis of trends and problems. A number of joint preserving alternatives to total replacement are available but intervention must be early, before a salvage situation exists.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that alterations in insulin metabolism following injury and infection result in depression of insulin levels and the development of insulin resistance. In order to further study insulin during septic and traumatic stress, we estimated insulin production in control (Group 1, n = 6), postoperative (Group 2, n = 5), and postoperative-septic (Group 3, n = 8) human subjects by measuring the 24-hour urinary C-peptide excretion. In addition, basal and peak glucose and insulin levels in response to a standard (0.5 gm/kg) intravenous glucose stimulus were measured immediately thereafter to determine if insulin levels reflected insulin production. Basal insulin for Groups 1, 2, and 3 (16 +/- 8.4, 10 +/- 3.4, 9.5 +/- 4.4 microU/ml +/- SD, respectively) were not substantially different. Peak insulin response to glucose infusion declined from Groups 1 to 3 (51 +/- 14, 42.4 +/- 31, 20.4 +/- 6.8 microU/ml, respectively) with Group 3 exhibiting a significantly decreased mean peak level compared to the other groups. Corresponding C-peptide excretion rates increased from Groups 1 to 3 (28.3 +/- 15.3, 63.7 +/- 27.6, 121.3 +/- 95.2 micrograms/day, respectively) with Group 3 exhibiting a significantly (p less than 0.05) higher level than Group 1. These data suggest that low insulin levels which may be evident in injured or septic patients not in shock reflect increased clearance and not decreased production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a prospective study of BHETI patients identified to be at high risk for UCSI, the use of lateral cervical spine view (LCV), three-view cervical spine series (FCS), and limited computerized tomography (CT) in the initial evaluation of these patients was analyzed. Thirteen of 204 patients sustained UCSI. Sensitivity of the LCV alone was 0.85 and the predictive value of the negative test was 0.97. Sensitivity and predictive value of a negative study were maximized by the use of FCS combined with CT when plain X-rays were inadequate. We conclude that technically adequate, normal FCS can be safely used to eliminate the presence of UCSI. If these studies are technically inadequate, the addition of a limited CT can be used to \"clear\" the spine.\r"

Our data show that the concomitant administration of the pure antiandrogen flutamide in association with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (D-Trp6) luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ethylamide caused a 64 to 78 per cent decrease in serum prostatic acid phosphatase on days 3 and 7 after the start of treatment in 70 patients with previously untreated stage D2 prostatic cancer. Pain, which was present in 41 patients at the start of treatment, did not increase in any patient, it decreased in 7 at 1 week and it disappeared or decreased in 27 at 2 weeks. Performance, which originally was abnormal in 34 patients, became normal in 7 within 1 week and in 20 within 1 month (59 per cent). These data show that the addition of flutamide completely eliminates the risks of disease flare associated with the use of the otherwise exceptionally well tolerated luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in patients treated for prostatic cancer.\r"

A randomized prospective trial was done to compare the results of conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (30 patients) and the new method of bladder neck resection. Bladder neck resection was comparable to transurethral resection of the prostate with respect to postoperative hospital stay, maximal flow rates and postoperative complications. Bladder neck resection was better than transurethral resection with respect to the operating time, transfusion requirement, volume of irrigation fluid and postoperative urinary infection. We conclude that bladder neck resection is the operation of choice in patients with a prostate of 30 gm. or less.\r"

  ".U": "88011490\r", 
  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a 28-amino-acid polypeptide found in the human gut and genitourinary tract, primarily affects vasodilation and smooth-muscle relaxation. These effects have led to speculation that this neuropeptide may be a neurotransmitter in certain bodily functions, such as penile erection. We therefore designed an in vivo animal model to elucidate the influence of VIP and VIP antibody on the different stages of penile erection. We also performed immunohistochemical studies of the penile tissue to obtain further information about the distribution of VIP in the corpora cavernosa. Intracavernous injection of VIP induced penile erection. Its effect on arterial inflow was minor, but it caused active venous outflow restriction and was important in maintaining erection. VIP antibody blocked venous outflow restriction during neurostimulation-induced erection. VIP was found in the cavernous tissue (in the area between the smooth-muscle cells and the sinusoidal spaces) in close proximity to the arteries. We conclude that VIP is a neurotransmitter in the erectile tissue of the penis, and that its effects are similar to those from electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve. VIP increases arterial flow, decreases venous flow, and induces sinusoidal relaxation.\r"

In normal and hyperplastic prostates, strong immunoreactivity was found exclusively in glandular epithelial cells. No reaction was observed over the stroma. In well differentiated adenocarcinoma, the acinar cells were generally stained less intensely than in benign prostatic hyperplasia while in poorly differentiated tissue, strongly positive immunoperoxidase staining was found in some cancer cells scattered in the stroma. All prostatic cancer tissues examined (N = 21), with the exception of one, exhibited at least a few positive immunoreactive areas for the 94 amino acid secretory protein. In addition, immunoperoxidase staining was observed in lung and bone marrow metastases respectively in two patients with prostatic carcinoma. All other normal tissues and non-prostatic cancers studied to date were negative. These results suggest that this new marker could be a useful addition to prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen.\r"

The immunobead test is a laboratory method that identifies the classes of antisperm antibodies and their binding sites on the sperm surface. In this study we have investigated the variability in the pattern of antibody binding to spermatozoa after passive transfer from blood serum. Serum from a single donor containing antisperm antibodies of the IgG class was used in all experiments. The spermatozoa from 27 semen donors were found to differ significantly in the degree and location of immunobead binding after exposure to this serum. There was substantial day-to-day variability in the results for individual semen donors and the overall variability in test results was significantly greater when a number of semen donors was used rather than a single donor. These data suggest that details of antisperm antibody binding after passive transfer from body fluids may depend on the sperm donor. The design of research studies involving antibody transfer must take this source of variability into account.\r"

  ".W": "We present the first experience with in-office ultrasonography to further the office evaluation of children with urological problems. Since February 1986 we imaged prospectively the kidneys and bladders of 172 children (100 boys and 72 girls, mean age 6 years) who presented for office evaluation using a portable 5 MHz. real-time linear array scanner. Initially, we gained familiarity with in-office ultrasonography by examining 38 children who presented for evaluation of problems not recognized to be associated with renal malformations (that is undescended testis). In-office ultrasonography showed hydronephrosis in 1 boy with a buried penis that was found later to be owing to ureteropelvic junction obstruction requiring pyeloplasty. Then, in-office ultrasonography was used to supplement the office evaluation of children with a history of urine infection, voiding problems or known malformations of the kidney and/or bladder. The test showed that 12 of 24 children (50 per cent) with a history of urine infection had a thickened detrusor, large bladder capacity with or without residual urine or reduced sensation to void. In-office ultrasonography also showed that 24 of 74 children (32 per cent) with voiding problems had a thickened detrusor, large bladder capacity with or without residual urine, fecal impaction, suspected bladder neck obstruction (which later required internal urethrotomy) or small bladder capacity. In 35 children with known malformations of the urinary tract in-office ultrasonography was useful to assess the progress of hydronephrosis (29) or to clarify the etiology of the hydronephrosis (4). The diagnostic value of this test was evaluated in 98 children in whom enough data were available to compare the results to those of subsequent urography or clinical outcome. In-office ultrasonography had a 98 per cent sensitivity and an 82 per cent specificity rate. We conclude that in-office ultrasonography is a reliable means to identify incomplete bladder emptying in children with urine infection related to dysfunctional voiding, identify detrusor thickening related to the unstable bladder and indicate the likely etiology of hydronephrosis.\r"

We present 4 consecutive cases of bilateral neonatal torsion seen between 1966 and 1986. Two cases were asynchronous, 1 of which with a previously normal-appearing contralateral gonad was rendered anorchid. In the other patient a testicle was salvaged by prompt intervention. We have adopted a policy of prompt exploration with contralateral orchiopexy in all cases of unilateral neonatal torsion. Treatment of the ipsilateral testicle is determined by operative findings.\r"

  ".W": "We believe that the confusion regarding abnormal renal development could be reduced by more precise terminology. Therefore, we suggest precise definitions for dysgenesis, hypoplasia, dysplasia, hypodysplasia, aplasia and agenesis of the kidney. We suggest the term reflux nephropathy be a generic label for any instance of abnormal renal morphology (gross or microscopic) associated with vesicoureteral reflux. Hypoplasia and hypodysplasia can be subclassified on the basis of associated urological criteria. There have been many previous attempts to classify cystic disease of the kidney but none has been accepted collectively by pathologists, urologists, nephrologists and radiologists. On the basis of known patterns of inheritance, a classification is outlined in which renal cystic disease is divided into 2 major groups: genetic and nongenetic. Each entity is discussed.\r"

The resultant columnar metaplasia and hypertrophic changes in the mucosa produced stickiness and occlusion of the meatus. As a result a combined graft has superceded the simple mucosal graft for urethral substitution extending to the tip of the penis. The terminal few millimeters of such a graft are fashioned from preputial or penile skin, and they prevent exposure of the bladder mucosa to air. Our initial results are encouraging, although followup is short.\r"

  ".U": "88011524\r", 
  ".W": "Of 47 children diagnosed as having epididymitis between 1975 and 1985, 8 of 17 prepubertal patients (47 per cent, or 17 per cent of the total group), including 3 of 4 infants (75 per cent), had an underlying urogenital anomaly. Thus, patients with epididymitis secondary to an underlying anomaly present at an earlier age. The common finding in patients with underlying anomalies was a pathological connection between the urinary tract and the genital duct system or bowel. Coliform urinary infections predominated in patients with underlying anomalies (4 of 6). Although a positive urine culture suggested an underlying anomaly (positive predictive value 0.60), a negative culture virtually ruled out an anomaly (negative predictive value 1.00). Of the 8 patients with underlying anomalies 6 underwent voiding cystourethrography and 6 underwent excretory urography, and the diagnosis was established in 6 (100 per cent) and 4 (67 per cent), respectively. Thus, voiding cystourethrography has the greatest diagnostic yield. Any prepubertal patient with epididymitis merits a complete urological evaluation, including a urine culture, voiding cystourethrography and excretory urography to rule out an underlying urogenital anomaly, which often is amenable to an operation. Surgery often involves severance of the pathological urogenital or urinary-fecal connection and it was successful in 7 of our 8 patients.\r"

  ".W": "Despite institutional variation in the treatment of synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor, a 76 per cent over-all 3-year survival rate has been achieved. We reviewed 145 patients with stage V disease (synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor) registered with National Wilms Tumor Studies 2 and 3. The majority of the patients (94, or 65 per cent) underwent initial surgical resection followed by chemotherapy with or without radiation, with a 3-year survival rate of 82 per cent. However, survival of 45 patients who underwent initial biopsy, postoperative chemotherapy and second-look surgery was 57 per cent at 3 years, a result not significantly different statistically from the 82 per cent figure. Only 38 per cent of the patients had all tumor resected at 1 or more operations. Therefore, emphasis is being placed on chemotherapy as the predominant treatment modality for this disease. Unfavorable histology was found in 10 per cent of the patients and 6 patients (4 per cent) had discordant histology, that is unfavorable histology on 1 side with contralateral favorable histology. Better prognostic factors were patient age less than 3 years at diagnosis, lower stage of the most advanced lesions, favorable histology and negative nodal involvement. Currently, routine bilateral biopsy of tumors is recommended, followed by chemotherapy according to the stage of the most advanced lesion. Impressive shrinkage of tumor can be expected with the hope that surgery will allow renal preservation (excisional biopsy or partial nephrectomy) rather than nephrectomy.\r"

  ".U": "88011540\r", 
  ".W": "Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy studies with paraffin-embedded archival tumor specimens were performed by flow cytometry on extracted nuclei from 56 Wilms tumors. Before the era of chemotherapy 9 patients had a 33 per cent survival rate at 5 years. No significant correlation between deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern and survival was seen in this early group of patients. Since 1960, 47 patients underwent radical nephrectomy and received chemotherapy. Deoxyribonucleic acid histograms in this group were normal in 13 tumors, while 23 tumors exhibited a tetraploid pattern (greater than 10 per cent nuclei in the G2 peak) and 11 showed an aneuploid pattern. Survival rates according to deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern showed that 100 per cent of the patients with a normal or aneuploid histogram pattern were alive at 2 and 5 years. Patients with a deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid pattern had a significantly worse survival of 74 and 69 per cent at 2 and 5 years (p less than 0.02 and less than 0.01), respectively. Tumors with a normal or aneuploid histogram pattern for all stages and a deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid pattern for pathological stage I or II were associated with a 2 and 5-year survival rate of 100 and 97 per cent, respectively. However, patients with stages III and IV tumors with a deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid pattern had a significantly worse survival of 25 per cent at 2 and 5 years (p less than 0.0001). Measurement of nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy identifies a patient group who are at high risk for treatment failure, that is stages III and IV tumors with a deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid pattern.\r"

  ".U": "88011542\r", 
  ".W": "The pathogenesis of renal dysplasia, a common congenital renal malformation, remains poorly understood. However, the disease is believed to represent failure of normal renal morphogenesis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a shift in the composition of the extracellular matrix from an interstitial type to a basement membrane type heralds induction of the renal mesenchyme. In addition, 2 agents that inhibit glycosylation of extracellular matrix glycoconjugates, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine and tunicamycin, prevent induction of tubules in vitro. To investigate the relationship between failure of tubulogenesis and renal dysplasia experimentally, we used these inhibitors as potential teratogens and examined the resultant effects of the renal distribution of 2 extracellular matrix constituents: laminin, a basement membrane glycoprotein, and fibronectin, an interstitial glycoprotein. We documented the normal shift in the distribution of laminin and fibronectin during tubulogenesis. Fibronectin, prominent in undifferentiated mesenchyme, tended to disappear during development, while laminin appeared in increasing amounts within differentiating tubules. Renal rudiments (7 to 9 days of incubation) were exposed to tunicamycin, 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine or control media in vitro and then they were permitted to develop further as grafts in ovo. In 127 surviving grafts those treated at 8 days of incubation for 48 hours most often were dysplastic: 12 of 18 (67 per cent) tunicamycin versus 3 of 16 (19 per cent) control media (p less than 0.025) and 8 of 13 (62 per cent) 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine versus 2 of 16 (12 per cent) control media (p less than 0.025). Most rudiments exposed to 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine or tunicamycin for only 24 hours at 8 days of incubation or at 7 or 9 days of incubation were not dysplastic. Finally, 4 chick kidneys with induced dysplasia and 2 fresh surgical specimens with dysplasia were stained for laminin and fibronectin with indirect immunofluorescence and all showed abnormal distributions of both glycoproteins. These results support existing theories that dysplasia is the result of a disruption in normal epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during the induction of renal tubules.\r"

As a control, a similar series was performed without patching. Autologous saphenous vein was used as a patch in one group of patients, whereas in another, the bifurcation was widened by suturing the external carotid to the internal carotid artery, advancing the bifurcation by several centimeters, a technique we termed bifurcation advancement. All three groups were studied at least 1 year after operation by means of Doppler ultrasonography. We found no difference in either of the patched techniques compared with unpatched controls. Significant recurrent stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) was found in 12.5% of reconstructions with a vein patch, 12.5% of those with bifurcation advancement, and 16.6% of those with simple closure. The overall incidence of significant recurrent stenosis was 13.8%, with symptoms occurring in 2.7%.\r"

There was no obvious difference in the clinical presentations between fungal and bacterial infections. In two cases (14%), there was a strong predisposition toward fungal infection: one in a patient with pulmonary histoplasmosis and one in a patient with leukemia.

No consistent professional tradition emerged. Many physicians, including Galen and Sydenham, fled from patients with contagious epidemic diseases. Many of their colleagues, at considerable personal risk, remained behind to care for plague victims. This inconsistency suggests that an ethic stressing traditional professional duties may not be ideal for defining the optimal relation of the medical profession to patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A new professional ethic to guide physicians in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic is needed. This ethic cannot be entirely derived from these patients' right to health care, which is primarily a claim against society rather than individual practitioners. Civil and professional proscriptions against negligence or abandonment apply only to therapeutic relationships after they are contracted. However, a professional duty to treat human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons could be based on the understanding of medicine as a moral enterprise. In this context, treating human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons is a virtuous act, which meets both patients' and society's health needs and affirms the moral mission of health care.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer incidence trends from the late 1940s to 1983-84 were assessed among white residents of five geographic areas (Atlanta, Connecticut, Detroit, Iowa, San Francisco-Oakland) by means of data derived from several National Cancer Institute surveys, the Connecticut Tumor Registry, and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Incidence trends were compared with mortality trends for the entire United States and for the same five study areas. This study documented rising incidence and mortality rates for four cancers: lung cancer, melanoma of the skin, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Increases in lung cancer continued through the early 1980s, but the rate of increase has been moderating during recent years, particularly among males and at younger ages for whom recent declines are evident. Overall, lung cancer incidence rates increased more than 220 and 400% among males and females, respectively. Although much rarer than lung cancer, melanoma of the skin and multiple myeloma increased greatly until the early 1980s among both males and females. The overall rate of increase in melanoma incidence among males was greater than that for lung cancer, and the rate of increase in multiple myeloma mortality among females was exceeded only by that for lung cancer. Increases of 70-120% were observed for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Increases in incidence and mortality rates for pancreatic cancer were apparent during the early years but less conspicuous in recent years. Laryngeal and kidney cancer rates generally increased substantially, although the changes were not remarkable for laryngeal cancer mortality among males and kidney cancer mortality among females. The rates for cancers of the mouth and pharynx increased among females but not males. Prostate, colon, and bladder cancer incidence rates increased more than 65% among males, whereas mortality rates changed only moderately. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased more than 75% among both sexes until the late 1970s, but mortality rates have declined during the period of study. Breast cancer incidence increased 30%, whereas mortality rates remained remarkably constant. The incidence of corpus uteri cancer increased dramatically during the mid-1970s and decreased substantially thereafter; these changes were not reflected in the mortality rates, which continually declined during the entire time period. The incidence of testicular cancer increased more than 90% and that of Hodgkin's disease did not change greatly; however, mortality rates for both cancers declined more than 50% since the late 1960s and early 1970s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to improve the strategy for intraperitoneal immunotherapy of human ovarian carcinoma with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Since ovarian tumor cells generally appear to be confined to the peritoneal cavity, regional therapy is appropriate and can reduce the need for strictly tumor-specific MAbs. In normal mice, with the use of radioiodine-labeled MAbs, transfer from peritoneal cavity to blood was found to be very rapid, within hours, and this transfer was delayed slightly by increasing the volume injected. The presence of ascitic fluid in mice greatly delayed the rate of transfer. For reduction of possible toxicity for normal cells outside the peritoneal cavity, the hepatic receptor for desialylated serum glycoproteins was used. Neuraminidase treatment of all major mouse immunoglobulin classes and subclasses, including IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA, did not cause their rapid blood clearance, although similar treatment of fetuin was effective. Conjugation of IgG with galactose, with use of the cyanomethyl derivative, did result in very rapid blood clearance via the hepatic lectin; within 3 minutes clearance was essentially complete. The specificity of uptake was demonstrated by inhibition with desialylated fetuin. Degradation within the liver, release of the radioiodine, and excretion from the animal were also quite rapid, within hours. This conjugation procedure had no effect on the antibody activity of the two MAbs tested. Such modified MAbs, therefore, are degraded almost immediately after entering the blood and would be advantageous in intraperitoneal therapy and in other situations in which regional immunotherapy is appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "An examination of the English language literature published from 1950 to 1985 on the subject of alcohol consumption and falls yielded 21 studies. Those identified represented four types. Type I studies examined alcohol exposure among fall cases. The percentage of fatal falls related to alcohol exposure ranged from 21 to 77%; for nonfatal falls the range was 17-53%. Among Type II studies comparing fatal falls among alcoholics to the standard population, ratios of observed to expected deaths ranged from 2.9 to 16. Type III studies compared blood alcohol levels (BALs) of fall patients and disease patients treated medically. Those studies yielded odds ratios from 2.5 to 10. In the single Type IV study comparing BALs of fall subjects with nonfall controls relative risks were 1 (BALs, 50-100 mg/dl), 3 (BALs, 100-150 mg/dl) and 60 (BALs, greater than 160 mg/dl). We conclude that there is substantial evidence that alcohol increases risks for falls, but that more case-control studies (Type IV) are required to evaluate the exact magnitude of this risk and intervention studies are needed to assess methods to reduce the risk.\r"

The cut surface showed a well demarcated white, round shape, and a cystic formation measuring 1.8 X 1.4 cm was present in the center of the mass. Microscopically, the mass showed high-grade-type mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which consisted of squamous cells, mucus-producing cells, and glandular cells. The cystic wall was lined with apparently benign glandular, mucus-producing cells, squamous metaplastic cells, and tumor cells. The tumor was intimately contiguous with the cyst and gradual transition between tumor cells and cystic lining cells was recognized. It is suggested that the mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the liver in the present case was derived from malignant transformation of a preexisting cyst of the liver.\r"

Significantly reduced K-values and insulin release together with glucose intolerance during IVGTT were observed in hemipancreatectomized recipients (HPS) without grafts. Orthotopic and heterotopic PDS transplantation improved the glucose intolerance of HPS recipients; orthotopically sited grafts rendering the best curves. Normal glucose tolerance was not achieved. Both orthotopic and heterotopic PDS transplantation rendered suboptimal insulin release during IVGTT; heterotopically draining grafts released significantly more insulin than orthotopic grafts. Hyperglucagonaemia during IVGTT was a constant feature in both groups, heterotopic grafts releasing the most glucagon during stimulation. C-peptide release was significantly lower in orthotopic grafts compared to normal animals or heterotopically drained insulin. It is concluded that glucose tolerance was not directly related to insulin or glucagon release in this study as orthotopic grafts rendered near-normal IVGTT curves in the presence of hypoinsulinaemia, hyperglucagonaemia, and reduced C-peptide values. The hormonal response after PDS transplantation was variable and the advantages of portal vs systemic insulin drainage remain to be defined.\r"

In all patients protamine chloride was given at a ratio of 1 unit of protamine to 1 unit of injected heparin. In Group I (10 patients) all protamine was infused within 10 minutes after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group II (10 patients) received 75% of the calculated protamine dose within 10 minutes after termination of bypass and the remainder after transfusion of all blood in the heart-lung machine. Plasma heparin levels were significantly lower in Group II 5 minutes after transfusion of all blood in the heart-lung machine and were 0.13 units/ml (standard deviation 0.04) in Group I and 0.06 units/ml (standard deviation 0.05) in Group II (p less than 0.001) 60 minutes after bypass. Activated partial thromboplastin time mirrored the changes in plasma heparin, whereas activated clotting time (Hemochron) was too insensitive to detect these low plasma heparin levels. We conclude that the two-dose protocol resulted in more complete heparin neutralization than the one-dose protocol.\r"

Myocardial temperatures, right atrial electrical activity, and postoperative arrhythmias were assessed in 103 patients participating in two consecutive randomized trials comparing blood cardioplegia (n = 36), crystalloid cardioplegia (n = 38), and diltiazem crystalloid cardioplegia (n = 29). Both right atrial and right ventricular temperatures were significantly warmer (p less than 0.05) during delivery of the blood cardioplegic solution than during delivery of either the crystalloid or the diltiazem crystalloid cardioplegic solutions; the aortic root temperatures were 9 degrees +/- 2 degrees C with blood cardioplegia and 5 degrees + 1 degrees C with both crystalloid and diltiazem crystalloid cardioplegia. Atrial activity during cardioplegic arrest was greatest with blood cardioplegia (12 +/- 3 beats/min), lower with crystalloid cardioplegia (10 +/- 2 beats/min), and minimal with diltiazem crystalloid cardioplegia (5 +/- 1 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Perioperative ischemic injury (by creatine kinase MB isoenzyme analysis) was greatest with crystalloid cardioplegia (p less than 0.05). Postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias (both treated and untreated) were more frequent after crystalloid cardioplegia (crystalloid, 63%; blood, 40%; diltiazem, 47%; p less than 0.05). Patients in whom supraventricular arrhythmias developed had significantly more postoperative ischemic injury (by creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme analysis, p less than 0.05). Blood cardioplegia reduced supraventricular arrhythmias by reducing ischemic injury despite warmer intraoperative temperatures and more right atrial activity. Diltiazem crystalloid cardioplegia reduced postoperative arrhythmias by improving intraoperative myocardial protection and suppressing intraoperative and postoperative atrial activity. Crystalloid cardioplegia cooled but did not arrest the right atrium intraoperatively, resulted in the most perioperative ischemic injury, and yielded the highest incidence of postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias.\r"

The method was quick and easy to perform and highly effective in establishing firm and permanent approximation of the sternum. Presence of factors associated with increased risk of postoperative sternal dehiscence did not affect the outcome when Mersilene tape was used. We highly recommend this technique in all median sternotomy incisions.\r"

The anterior and posterior leaflets adjacent to the incompetent commissure were separated from the anulus to allow coaptation of the three leaflets in the middle. In conjunction with the commissure, half of the isolated anulus was then excluded with a continuous 3-0 Ti-Cron suture. A 5-0 Prolene suture was then used to readapt the cut edges of the leaflets to the shortened anulus. In this way it was possible to reduce the circumference of the anulus selectively, without reducing the active area of the leaflets. All patients survived. A significant decrease in the mean right atrial pressure without evidence of regurgitation could be recorded in all patients. Postoperative morphometric echocardiographic evaluation of the tricuspid valve showed a maximal anulus diameter even larger than in normal hearts. No inflow obstruction was present. The systolic shortening of the anulus ranged within normal limits. The opening amplitude of the leaflet as well as the slope of the ejection fraction were not decreased. No significant regurgitation was evidenced by contrast echocardiograms. One to 3 months postoperatively, no annuloplasty dehiscence has occurred.\r"

  ".W": "A 58-year-old man with AIDS improved clinically after the introduction of fusidic acid, 500 mg three times a day orally, to his therapeutic regimen. Fusidic acid may have had a direct effect against HIV. Fusidic acid has anti-HIV activity in vitro at levels readily attainable in vivo. The drug does not appear to be a reverse transcriptase inhibitor and its mode of action against HIV is unknown. Fusidic acid can be given orally and has few side-effects. These results justify fuller evaluation of fusidic acid as therapy against AIDS and HIV infection.\r"

  ".U": "88012883\r", 
  ".W": "The reassessment of the radiation dosimetry from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs is almost complete. Since atomic bomb survivors provide a major source of data for estimates of risk of cancer induction by radiation the impact of the new dosimetry on risk estimates and radiation protection standards is important. The changes include an increase of about 20% in the estimated yield of the Hiroshima bomb and a reduction in the estimated doses from neutrons in both cities. The estimated neutron dose for Hiroshima is about 10% of the previous estimate. The neutron doses are now so small that direct estimates of neutron relative biological effectiveness may be precluded or be much more difficult. There is little change in most of the gamma ray organ doses because various changes in the new estimates tend to cancel each other out. The new estimate of the attenuation of the free-in-air kerma by the walls of the homes is about twice that used in the previous dosimetry. But the transmission of gamma radiation to the deep organs such as bone marrow is significantly greater than earlier estimates. Probably future risk estimates for radiogenic cancer will be somewhat higher because of both the new dosimetry and the new cancer mortality data. New risk estimates should be available in 1988.\r"
