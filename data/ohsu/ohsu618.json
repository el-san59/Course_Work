Blood samples were collected every 15 minutes for 24 hours before and after 7 days of estradiol benzoate administration, which achieved mean (+/- SE) estradiol concentrations of 424 +/- 54 pg/ml. The luteinizing hormone pulse frequency decreased significantly during sleeping hours both before (p less than 0.05) and after (p less than 0.005) estradiol benzoate administration. After estradiol benzoate, there also was diurnal variation in overall mean luteinizing hormone concentrations, which markedly increased secretion in the morning hours. The diurnal changes in luteinizing hormone secretion varied inversely with those of prolactin. These findings are consonant with the observation that the onset of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge in women occurs most frequently in the early morning hours.\r"

  ".W": "Gestational diabetes is a predictor of glucose intolerance in subsequent pregnancies and in the nongravid state. Many pregnant women are not tested for gestational diabetes, although they or their offspring may show signs suggestive of antecedent hyperglycemia. We examined the diagnostic utility of a postpartum (within 48 hours), 100 gm, oral glucose tolerance test and cord plasma glucose, cord plasma C-peptide, and 2-hour neonatal plasma glucose tests to detect antecedent gestational diabetes in women with documented gestational diabetes (n = 37) or with normal glucose tolerance test results late in the third trimester (n = 28). The 1-hour, 2-hour, and incremental 1-hour + 2-hour [( 1-hour - fasting] + [2-hour - fasting]) [2-hour - fasting]) glucose values of the postpartum glucose tolerance test showed significant differences between study participants with and without gestational diabetes (164 +/- 30 versus 115 +/- 22, 145 +/- 31 versus 101 +/- 21, and 153 +/- 51 versus 67 +/- 33 mg/dl, respectively, p less than 0.025). Maternal fasting and 3-hour postpartum glucose tolerance test glucose, cord plasma glucose, cord plasma C-peptide, and 2-hour neonatal plasma glucose values showed no significant between-group differences. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for these tests indicated that the incremental 1-hour + 2-hour postpartum glucose tolerance test glucose values best sustain test specificity at the low test threshold values necessary for high test sensitivity. A threshold of 110 mg/dl for this test yielded a predicted specificity of 90% and sensitivity of 80% with regard to antecedent gestational diabetes.\r"

The timing and mechanism by which the infecting organisms gain access to the uterine cavity are unclear. One possibility is that the infection may occur postpartum by ascending colonization of the wound. Alternatively, myometritis may be already present at the time the cesarean section is performed in asymptomatic patients. With tissue necrosis, the stage is then set for puerperal endomyometritis. To study this second alternative mechanism, myometrial and placental biopsy specimens were obtained in 91 asymptomatic patients at the time of cesarean section. Histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis was identified in 10% (9/91) of patients. Acute myometritis was present in 11% (10/91) of the myometrial biopsy specimens. Seven of the nine women (77%) with subclinical acute chorioamnionitis demonstrated extension of the inflammation into the myometrium. Thirty-two percent (8/25) of women in labor and 31% (5/16) of those with rupture of membranes for greater than 6 hours had acute chorioamnionitis or myometritis, which is significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than in women without these risk factors. These findings suggest that approximately one third of asymptomatic women with rupture of the membranes for more than 6 hours or who are in labor at the time of cesarean section demonstrate histologic evidence of subclinical chorioamnionitis. In most of these patients the myometrium is also involved. The uterine incision is then performed through infected myometrium, possibly setting the stage for puerperal endomyometritis.\r"

The procedure continues to be advocated, however, for cases in which there is an underlying gynecologic pathologic condition. The morbidity of this procedure has not been directly compared with that for indicated hysterectomy in nonpregnant women. Between January 1976 and January 1987, 50 patients underwent abortion hysterectomy at The University of Chicago. The morbidity and mortality rates of these patients were compared with those of 50 premenopausal nonpregnant women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for gynecologic pathologic status. There was no statistically significant different between the groups in the duration of surgery, estimated blood loss, or infectious morbidity. No operative site infections or other adverse sequelae were noted at the time of final postoperative examination. These data support the relative safety of abdominal abortion hysterectomy for women with undesired pregnancy in whom hysterectomy is indicated for an underlying gynecologic pathologic condition.\r"

This study was conducted to explore the ability of the auscultated acceleration test to predict nonstress test results when vibratory acoustic stimulation is used to elicit fetal reactivity. After antepartum nonstress testing on 100 gravid women between 28 and 43 weeks' gestation, a 6-minute auscultated acceleration test protocol was performed with two vibratory acoustic stimulations to the maternal abdomen if no spontaneous fetal heart rate acceleration occurred. The ability of the auscultated acceleration test to predict nonstress test results after selected variables were controlled for was as follows: sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 97.6%; false-positive results, 14.3%; and false-negative results, 4.7%. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, in addition to the auscultated acceleration test, gestational age and race contributed significantly to the prediction of nonstress test results. Although specificity and the false-positive rate were improved, the use of vibratory acoustic stimulations to elicit fetal movement did not improve the validity of the auscultated acceleration test in terms of sensitivity and false-negative results over previous studies. However, the auscultated acceleration test continues to show potential as an initial screening test for fetal assessment. In addition to recommendations for further research, methodologic issues related to sampling techniques are identified.\r"

Focusing only on specific trimesters considered risk periods for each drug-fetal occurrence of adverse drug reaction, the use of tetracyclines during the first trimester of pregnancy was the most prevalent (21.3 exposed women/1000) prescribed drug associated with known or suspected fetal adverse drug reactions. The second most prevalent was phenobarbital in the first trimester, with 10.8 women exposed/1000. Following a close third was the use of the sulfonamides in the second trimester, with 10.0 women exposed/1000. The prescribing of nitrofurantoin and the sulfonamides in the last trimester and tetracyclines throughout pregnancy appears excessive. There are few indications for the outpatient use of the tetracyclines during pregnancy. Practitioners caring for pregnant women need to carefully evaluate the need for these drugs and consider when risks may outweigh benefits.\r"

A total of 1057 units of red blood cells were crossmatched, and 362 of these 1057 units were transfused to 100 parturient women so that the overall crossmatch/transfusion ratio was 2.9:1. Five percent of transfused patients received 1 unit; 52% of patients received 2 units, 19% received 3 units and 24% received greater than or equal to 4 units of packed red blood cells. Major indications for transfusion were uterine atony, 27%; retained placenta, 17%; trauma, 17%, placenta previa, 7%; and abruptio placentae, 5%. In 12% of patients transfusions were done because of anemia.

All these genes were found to be expressed in the tissues analyzed. The hsp-70 gene was expressed at nearly constant levels throughout the development period surveyed, whereas N-myc, C-sis, and Hu-2 showed a coordinated pattern of regulated expression. These results are consistent with a functional role of these genes in the early course of human development.\r"

We have compared human chorionic gonadotropin output in placental explants of 6 to 12 and 37 to 40 weeks' gestational age after addition of hormones on days 4 and 5 of 8 days of culture. Human chorionic gonadotropin production was sevenfold greater in early versus late cultures. In early cultures human chorionic gonadotropin output was increased threefold to fourfold by progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and cortisol whereas late cultures responded only to progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone. The output of combinations of steroids was additive or better (up to fifteenfold). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone increased human chorionic gonadotropin output only slightly (onefold to twofold) while testosterone was inhibitory (early) or ineffective (late). Estradiol had no effect. These studies demonstrate that explants of early placental tissue provide a useful model for study of human chorionic gonadotropin production, that there are many similarities but some clear differences between early and late secretion, and that steroids exert significant effects on human chorionic gonadotropin production of placental cultures.\r"

In men, 9.2% of the sera were positive for immunoglobulin A, 7.9% for immunoglobulin G, and 5.1% for immunoglobulin M antibodies to their own sperm. In women, immunoglobulin M antibodies to the husband's sperm predominated (10.1%), with immunoglobulins G (8.3%) and A (5.9%) following. Differences between men and women in the incidence of immunoglobulin A (p less than 0.01) and M (p less than 0.005) antibodies were significant. In both sexes only about two thirds of the antibody-positive sera remained positive when donor sperm was substituted for partners' sperm in the assay. The decreased occurrences of antisperm immunoglobulins A (p less than 0.025) and G (p less than 0.01) in men and of immunoglobulins G (p less than 0.025) and M (p less than 0.01) in women were significant. Incubation of donor sperm in the husband's cell-free seminal fluid before analysis led to the acquisition of sperm reactivity with husband-specific antisperm antibodies in only one of eight women. Women with husband-specific antisperm antibodies also exhibited differences in their cell-mediated immune responses to sperm from various men. Thus sperm from different individuals vary in their ability to react with the immune system of sperm-sensitized men or women.\r"

Parameters returned to baseline values or were improved after drug administration. Erythrocyte morphologic features did not change significantly with the onset of the syndrome. Echinocytosis was present during baseline measurement and persisted throughout hypertension. However, after thromboxane synthetase inhibition, percentages of discocytes increased (p less than or equal to 0.005) with the same frequency that echinocyte numbers decreased (p less than or equal to 0.05). Schistocytes were present throughout the study, and changes in their numbers were not detected. Serum phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, and bilirubin levels and anion gap rose significantly during hypertension and returned to normal levels after drug treatment. We speculate that CGS13080 or CGS12970, by decreasing thromboxane levels and blood pressure, promoted the normalization of erythrocyte membranes.\r"

These transformed cells were tumorigenic in nude mice. Deoxyribonucleic acid of both human papillomaviruses induced morphologically transformed foci in Syrian hamster embryo cell cultures, but these transformed cells were not tumorigenic. Southern blot analyses revealed transfected deoxyribonucleic acid in the human papillomavirus type 16 transformed cells, whereas viral deoxyribonucleic acid was not evident in the human papillomavirus type 18 transformed cells.

These experiments were carried out at a time in gestation during the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin. Twelve catheterized fetal sheep were included in this study. Seven were made hyperglycemic by glucose infusions during 5 days (group I) and five were control animals (group II) that received saline solution infusions (0.45 gm/dl). In group I, glycemia increased from 14.7 +/- 5.0 to 54.6 +/- 16.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.001), whereas oxygen content decreased from 8.5 +/- 1.7 to 6.4 +/- 2.2 ml/dl (p less than 0.01). Red blood cells obtained before and after 5 days of glucose or saline solution infusions were incubated in an amino acid mixture containing 14C-leucine. The hemoglobins were then subjected to polypeptide chain elution with carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. The amount of fetal hemoglobin synthesized was determined by the ratio of radioactive gamma-chain to total of radioactive non-alpha-chains. The data demonstrated that the hyperglycemic fetus synthesizes more fetal hemoglobin than expected for the period of fetal development (78.0% +/- 10.9% versus 59.8% +/- 11.3%, p less than 0.02).\r"

Electron microscopic examination of freshly isolated and cultured cells revealed an ultrastructure indicative of smooth muscle cells. Intracellular microelectrode studies were performed on freshly isolated cells. Passive membrane properties were: resting membrane potential, -49.4 mV; specific membrane resistance, 6.06 kohms-cm2; specific membrane capacitance, 1.57 microfarad per square centimeter. Outward-going rectification was observed in response to depolarizing current pulses. Regenerative action potentials were not observed; however, transient voltage responses were elicited after depolarizing, but not hyperpolarizing, current pulses. These studies characterize a human tissue preparation that is applicable to electrophysiologic investigation of the control of uterine function.\r"

During the balloon application, regular uterine contractions were initiated and increased in all patients, with four patients in group 1 and five in group 2 aborting or being delivered within 24 hours. Light and electron microscopic studies of the amnion obtained during apparent uterine activity or after delivery revealed normal cell morphologic features in both groups although an increased fat deposition in cytoplasm was noted in group 2. Decidua parietalis exhibited normal cell morphologic features in both groups, and cytochemical demonstration of acid-phosphatase activity in decidual cells confirmed no leakage of the lysosomal enzyme into the cell cytoplasm. These findings indicate that stretch-induced delivery is initiated independent of the functional fetal role and without dysfunction of the amnion and decidua.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that mullerian inhibiting substance, another fetal testicular product, might inhibit lung maturation measured as disaturated phosphatidylcholine accumulation. Initially, female fetal rat lungs were incubated with fetal testis or ovary or nanomolar concentrations of bovine mullerian inhibiting substance. Cultured lungs produced less disaturated phosphatidylcholine after incubation for 5 days with either testis (p = 0.012) or mullerian inhibiting substance than after coculture with ovary. In more comprehensive experiments, female lung fragments of 17.5 days' gestation, when incubated with nanomolar concentrations of bovine mullerian inhibiting substance or picomolar concentrations of human recombinant mullerian inhibiting substance, showed significant suppression of disaturated phosphatidylcholine accumulation (p less than 0.004) when compared with incubation with vehicle buffer. The suppression of surfactant accumulation produced in vitro by mullerian inhibiting substance, a potent male-specific fetal regressor, may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of male infants to respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Partial or complete posterior vitreous detachment was present in 303 (84.9%) of the 357 eyes undergoing vitreous study; 43 (14.2%) of these 303 eyes had partial vitreous detachment with vitreous adhesion to the macula. Cystoid macular edema was present on angiography in 77 (20.6%) of 373 eyes undergoing fluorescein angiography; 20 (26.0%) of these 77 eyes had partial posterior vitreous detachment with vitreous adhesion to the macula, whereas only 23 (7.8%) of the 296 eyes without cystoid macular edema had such vitreous adhesion (P less than .001). Other findings were myopia in 116 of 367 eyes (31.6%) (103, or 88.8%, of the myopic eyes had posterior vitreous detachment), and increased intraocular pressure in 56 of 324 eyes (17.3%).\r"

The local macular electroretinograms of the affected eyes were significantly reduced and the implicit time in each component was significantly prolonged. The mean (+/- S.D.) amplitudes, expressed as percentages of mean amplitudes recorded in fellow eyes, were 64.6% +/- 22.7% (a-wave), 49.6% +/- 21.0% (b-wave), and 15.0% +/- 21.6% (oscillatory potentials). Two to five months after the macular detachment resolved, recordings in 18 patients showed remarkable recovery of a- and b-waves and shortened implicit times. However, the oscillatory potentials showed significantly small recovery in amplitude. Since oscillatory potentials and b-waves were significantly more deteriorated than a-waves in the presence of macular detachment, and oscillatory potentials showed selective delay of recovery in the convalescent stage, central serous chorioretinopathy may involve functional disturbances in the inner retinal layer as well as the photoreceptors.\r"

Both the horizontal disk diameter and the disk area were significantly smaller in fellow eyes of patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy than in controls (P less than .05). There was no statistical difference in the vertical disk diameters between the two groups.

All subjects had normal kinetic visual fields and optic nerve heads in both eyes at the time of testing and were followed up for a minimum of five years. Some subjects had normal baseline intraocular pressures whereas others were considered to have ocular hypertension. Of 276 individuals who were high corticosteroid responders (intraocular pressure greater than 31 mm Hg during dexamethasone administration), 36 (13.0%) developed glaucomatous visual field loss during the follow-up period. Only nine of 261 individuals (3.4%) who were intermediate responders (intraocular pressure 20 to 31 mm Hg during dexamethasone administration) and none of 251 individuals who were low responders (intraocular pressure less than 20 mm Hg during dexamethasone administration) developed glaucomatous visual field loss. However, the ability of the intraocular pressure response to dexamethasone to predict the development of glaucomatous visual field loss was not as good as the predictive power of a multivariate model that included patient age, race, baseline intraocular pressure, baseline outflow facility, baseline cup/disk ratio, and systemic hypertension.\r"

Using in situ hybridization of 35S-labeled antisense and sense RNA fibronectin probes, the present study demonstrates that most, but not all, normal alveolar macrophages contain fibronectin mRNA transcripts, and that among those macrophages expressing this gene, the relative amount of fibronectin mRNA transcripts varies from cell to cell. Interestingly, while 66 +/- 3% of normal alveolar macrophages contain fibronectin mRNA transcripts, this is increased to 82 +/- 2% (P less than 0.01) of alveolar macrophages recovered from the lungs of individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with exaggerated amounts of fibronectin in the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, of the macrophages expressing the fibronectin gene, those from IPF patients contain more fibronectin mRNA transcripts than those from normals. Consistent with this observation, evaluation of tissue samples from IPF patients demonstrated that of all cells present, alveolar macrophages showed the greatest numbers of fibronectin mRNA transcripts per cell. These observations demonstrate that there can be marked cell-to-cell variation in the expression of the gene for a macrophage product such as fibronectin, suggesting that there are processes that modulate similar cells in the same anatomic compartment to vary their expression of the same gene.\r"

The major component of the insoluble accumulations was the tubular myelinlike multilamellated structure that accounted for 42.6 +/- 12.4% of the total volume of insoluble material. These structures resembled tubular myelin as found in normal human lungs, consisting of lipid bilayer membranes separated by amorphous proteinaceous material; however, tubular myelinlike multilamellated structures lacked the intersecting membranes of normal tubular myelin. The distance between membranes varied from 150 to 300 A and this was similar to that found in tubular myelin from normal human lungs. Fused-membrane structures that were multilamellated but were without intervening amorphous lamellae accounted for 2.7 +/- 0.6% of the total volume of insoluble material. Crystals, identified by the presence of adhering materials, were present only in small amounts, accounting for only 0.07 +/- 0.03% of the volume of insoluble material. Neither fused-membrane structures nor crystals are present in lavage effluents from the lungs of normal humans. Membranous vesicles and electron-dense bodies, which resembled cell debris, together accounted for 21.2 +/- 10.1% of the total volume of insoluble material. Constituents of the pulmonary extracellular lining of normal human lungs such as secreted lamellar bodies and tubular myelin were minor components, together accounting for only 2.2 +/- 3.2% of the total volume of insoluble material. Amorphous material and miscellaneous structures accounted for 31.4 +/- 5.0% of the volume of insoluble material. Cellular disintegration and extracellular formation of unusual tubular myelinlike multilamellated structures appear to be major processes leading to the accumulation of insoluble materials in the alveoli and distal airways of patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.\r"

BAEC were irradiated with 0, 5, or 10 Gy of gamma rays and, on the third postirradiation day, exposed to fibrin, nicotine, or bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Release of prelabeled 51Cr, representing cell lysis, cell detachment, or a combination of the two, was determined. Significant differences between irradiated and control cells were determined by using paired Student's t-tests. Irradiation did not appear to have altered the sensitivity of BAEC to fibrin-induced injury. Cells irradiated with 10 Gy of gamma rays, but generally not those irradiated with half this dose, showed a heightened susceptibility to nicotine. Contrary to the nicotine results, irradiated cells showed less cell detachment and lysis after exposure to LPS. These results suggest that the susceptibility of irradiated BAEC to harmful stimuli depends largely on the nature of the stimulus as well as the radiation dose.\r"

  ".W": "A single infusion of Perilla ketone (PK) into sheep causes marked increases in lung fluid and solute exchange in the absence of any alteration in either pulmonary arterial or left atrial pressures. These alterations are most compatible with increased pulmonary microvascular permeability. The present paper describes the morphologic changes that accompany the previously described alterations in lung function. In five anesthetized open-chest sheep, lung biopsy tissue was taken at baseline and at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the start of a single infusion of PK (15-20 mg/kg given over a 20 minute period). Biopsy tissue was taken from different lobes of the lung in random sequence, fixed, and processed for light and electron microscopic examination. Three control sheep received the vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide, alone. Just 15 minutes after the start of PK infusion, alveolar capillary congestion, accumulation of peripheral lung neutrophils, and intraalveolar and interstitial edema were apparent. Electron microscopy revealed early evidence of damage to both the microvascular endothelial cells and Type I pneumonocytes. The damage became more severe with time. From 30 minutes, occasional nonciliated cells in the airway epithelium exhibited dilated rough and agranular endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, PK causes rapid onset of pulmonary edema accompanied by structural evidence of damage to the microvascular endothelium and Type I pneumonocytes. Pulmonary inflammation was also evident. These structural changes occur before the described alterations in either pulmonary microvascular permeability or reduction in pulmonary compliance.\r"

Focal loss of myocardial interstitial collagen occurred 2 weeks after a single injection of adriamycin. These foci become larger and more frequent through 6 weeks. Individual variation in response is evident after periods longer than 6 weeks. Concomitant with the focal loss is deposition of collagen in an abnormal distribution. Rather than the normal matrix being present, scars appear. The number and size of these scars is subject to variation from animal to animal. The collagen matrix loss is evident in some animals at 15 weeks after injection. These observations, coupled with the results of other studies on the myocardial collagen matrix, support the hypothesis that adriamycin cardiotoxicity is mediated in part by an affect on the collagen matrix.\r"

The collagens secreted into the culture medium and extracted from the cell layers of cultured HU1 cells were isolated after limited pepsin digestion and differential salt fractionation. More than 70% of the collagen synthesized by HU1 cells was secreted into the culture medium rather than remaining in the cell layer. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions of the collagens indicated the presence of components with properties corresponding to those of the chains present in the types I homotrimer, III, IV, and V collagens. Carboxymethyl-trisacryl chromatographic analysis revealed that approximately 90% of the total collagen synthesized by HU1 cells corresponded to the type I homotrimer and that the cells did not synthesize the alpha 2(I) collagen chain. Of the remaining collagen, types III, IV, and V molecules represented 6, 1, and 4%, respectively, of the total produced. These data establish the relative proportions of the collagens synthesized by cultured HU1 cells and represent one of the initial documentations of a cell line established from a carcinoma of pulmonary origin that synthesizes type I homotrimer molecules. Furthermore, these findings suggest that HU1 cells may be a useful model for investigating the molecular basis of alterations in collagen biosynthesis associated with neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies a two-step hypothesis explaining the mechanism of lethal ischemic injury to cardiac myocytes has been advanced. It proposes that damage to the myocyte cytoskeleton precedes, and predisposes the cell to, mechanical injury induced by cell swelling or by ischemic contracture. This study quantitated the prevalence of breakage of the major cytoskeletal attachment between the plasmalemma and peripheral myofibers as a function of the duration (0-180 minutes) of in vitro total ischemia in dog heart papillary muscle. Breakages of Z-band, plasmalemmal attachment complexes were few before 120 minutes of ischemia, but thereafter became more prevalent; the transition between the initial rate of appearance of the breaks and the later fast rates coincided with the appearance of severe cell swelling, ischemic contracture, and ultrastructural criteria of irreversible ischemic injury. Z-band, plasmalemmal attachment complex breakage and cell swelling resulted in formation of subsarcolemmal blebs. Two major bleb types have been discerned on ultrastructural appearance using as the criteria the preservation of integrity of the plasma-lemma and subplasmalemmal leptomeres. The identification of two types of blebs suggests two independent mechanisms of injury, the first directed at Z-band attachments, and the second at the cytoskeletal structures of A- and I-band regions of the plasmalemma.\r"

The presence of S-100 protein positive cells was examined by immunostaining in spontaneous and in transplantable rat pituitary tumors. The pituitaries of F344 rats showed a fivefold greater increase in weight in response to 5 weeks of DES treatment compared to pituitaries from W/F rats. S-100 protein (S-100) positive cells were significantly increased in both strains with hyperplastic pituitaries (P less than 0.05) 2 days after DES withdrawal. Ultrastructural studies revealed increased phagocytic activity in FS cells. S-100 positive cells were absent in both MtT/W15 and MtT/F4 transplantable tumors even after treatment with DES. Some spontaneous pituitary tumors in aged female rats had S-100 positive cells within the tumors at the periphery of the tumor nodules (3 of 12 cases), while most of these neoplasms did not contain S-100 positive cells. Incubation of normal dissociated pituitary cells with S-100 protein increased PRL secretion in vitro. The effectiveness of S-100 protein in increasing PRL secretion in vitro was less than thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). These results indicate that S-100 positive cells are present in normal and hyperplastic pituitaries, but not in spontaneous or in transplantable rat pituitary tumors and also suggest that the FS cells may exert a paracrine type regulation on PRL secretion.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the use of an anti-organelle antibody in a pathologic reaction the chromatolytic reaction was chosen for study. Qualitative analysis was made of rat hypoglossal nuclei stained with a cresyl violet method for Nissl substance and a monoclonal antibody against rat Golgi apparatus (10A8) 0 and 3 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after section of the right hypoglossal nerve. Marked dispersion of Nissl substance was noted at 2 weeks and of Golgi apparatus at 4 weeks. Reaggregation of staining had occurred for both organelles by 6 weeks. A quantitative light microscopic analysis was carried out for both stains on randomly selected hypoglossal sections from 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The analysis confirmed the qualitative observations and showed them to be highly significant. In addition, it revealed an increase in nuclear area from 0 to 2 weeks, an increase in cytoplasmic area at 4 weeks, decrease in the total area of Nissl substance from 0 to 2 and 4 to 6 weeks, decrease in the percent cytoplasmic areas occupied by Nissl from 0 to 2 weeks and decreases in both the total and percent cytoplasmic area occupied by Golgi apparatus maximal at 4 weeks. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses confirmed the use of this monoclonal antibody to study morphologic changes of the Golgi apparatus secondary to an experimental pathologic lesion. In addition, a previously unrecognized temporal dissociation between the changes of Nissl substance and Golgi apparatus was described.\r"

Two polyclonal and six different monoclonal antibodies were used to document the presence of GFAP-immunoreactive chondrocytes in all the fetal and neonatal cartilages as well as in the adult epiglottis, arythenoids, and lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi. The number of chondrocytes showing GFAP immunoreactivity decreased from fetal life to adulthood. Simultaneous immunoreactivity for GFAP and vimentin has also been ascertained in chondrocytes and in perichondrial stellate or elongated cells of the 25 chondromatous hamartomas investigated. These findings document yet another \"inappropriate\" pattern of intermediate filament immunoreactivity in normal and neoplastic human cells, and contradict the widely held supposition that the expression of GFAP is restricted to cells of glial origin.\r"

The effects of estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) on PRL and GH mRNA levels were investigated. Estrogens increased GH mRNA levels and decreased PRL mRNA levels as detected by in situ hybridization and Northern blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes, while inhibiting tumor growth. Similar changes in immunoreactive GH and PRL were seen in the tumor cells. The pituitary glands of tumor-bearing rats treated with estrogen for 3 weeks were increased in weight with a concurrent increase in pituitary PRL mRNA when analyzed by dot blot hybridization. These results indicate that estrogens have an inhibitory effect on the growth of the MtT/W15 tumor and increase GH protein and mRNA levels, while causing PRL protein and mRNA levels to decrease. The pituitaries of tumor-bearing rats concomitantly undergo PRL cell hyperplasia with an increase in PRL mRNA. These results also demonstrate a paradoxical effect of estrogens on different pituitary tissues.\r"

  ".W": "A 69 +/- 5% stenosis was produced in the rat aorta, with the purpose of correlating endothelial changes with local flow patterns and with levels of shear stress; the hydrodynamic data were obtained from a scaled-up model of the stenosed aorta. In the throat of the stenosis, where shear stress values were 15-25 times normal, the endothelium was stripped off within 1 hour. It regenerated at half the rate of controls but modulated into a cell type that could withstand the increased shear stress. Adaptations included changes in cell orientation, number, length, width, thickness, stress fibers, and anchoring structures, as well as changes in the length, argyrophilia, and permeability of the junctions. Areas of either elongated or \"polygonal\" cells consistently developed at the same sites in relation to the stenosis, but the hydrodynamic data showed that they did not always correspond (as had been anticipated) to high and low shear, respectively. It is concluded that endothelial cell shape in the living artery must be determined by some other factor(s) in addition to shear stress.\r"

These cases were selected from patients with intermediate thickness melanomas (0.76-4.0 mm thick) treated surgically to provide two groups of ten patients. One group had no evidence of recurrence with a minimum follow-up of 9 years. The second group of ten patients developed locoregional or systemic metastasis under follow-up, and seven of these patients died of disseminated melanoma. Age, sex, Breslow's tumor thickness, and Clark's level of invasion were similar in the two groups. Vascular quantitation was carried out by image analysis after vascular definition by Ulex europaeus-I agglutinin staining. The percentage vascular area at the tumor base in the recurrence group was more than twice that in the recurrence-free group. This study suggests that increased vascularity at the tumor base may have prognostic significance in intermediate thickness melanomas.\r"

Furthermore, during 1981-1984 teenage suicides decreased after newscasts about suicide; the reversal differs significantly from the association before 1981.\r"

The annual number of sex partners declined significantly from a median of 8.0 to 5.0 with no difference between the serologic groups. The number of subjects reporting no receptive anal intercourse increased as did condom use during anal receptive intercourse. More seronegatives than seropositives subjects reported no condom use during receptive anal intercourse with regular partners (45.7 per cent versus 23.4 per cent), and with casual partners (14.9 per cent versus 1.5% percent). Among subjects with the most casual sexual contact at the second visit, 33.3 per cent of seronegatives and 29.2 per cent of seropositives did not report usual condom use during receptive anal intercourse with casual partners. Although we have documented marked risk reductions, safe sex practices are still not universal, and a few individuals continue to put themselves at extremely high risk.\r"

Relative risks (RRs) in Blacks and Hispanics were highest in the northeast region, and higher in suburbs than in central cities of metropolitan areas. RRs in Blacks and Hispanics were greatest for AIDS directly or indirectly associated with intravenous-drug abuse by heterosexuals (range: 5.7-26.9) and were also high for AIDS associated with male bisexuality (range: 2.5-4.8), suggesting that these behaviors may be more prevalent in Blacks and Hispanics than in Whites. Prevention strategies should take into account these racial/ethnic differences.\r"

The proportion of smokers among the men was 50.5 per cent; only 0.33 per cent of the women reported they were smokers. Male smokers began smoking upon entering the work force, where social interaction encourages cigarette smoking. Seventy per cent of the male smokers smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes per day. Only 4.3 per cent perceived themselves as very addicted; 3.4 per cent reported they had no confidence in their ability to control the amount they smoke. The Chinese smokers are more likely to succeed in giving up cigarette smoking for at least one day, as well as for longer periods, compared to US smokers. The number of cigarettes smoked may be related to the individual's purchasing power. For China, strategic timeliness in legislative action and education is urgently needed to combat the high prevalence of cigarette smoking in males, at extremely high risk.\r"

Women who drank more than 15 grams of alcohol per day and whose relative weight was less than 21 kg/m2 were at increased risk of fractures, but these risk factors were not independent. Only the combination of alcohol intake and thinness substantially increased the likelihood of fracture.

Increases in hospital use for drug abuse treatment were found to have occurred between 1979 and 1985, with discharge rates per 10,000 population increasing from 3.1 to 6.0 for drug dependence and from 3.8 to 7.7 for nondependent drug abuse. Concurrent increases in availability of hospital-based inpatient drug and alcohol treatment programs and insurance coverage for drug abuse treatment were found to have occurred during the same period.\r"

The profoundly different philosophy behind evidential methods (as compared to traditional ones) is presented, as well as a comparative example showing the difference between the two approaches. The reasons why we mistakenly ascribe evidential meaning to p-values and related measures are discussed. Unfamiliarity with the technology and philosophy of evidence is seen as the main reason why certain arguments about p-values persist, and why they are frequently contradictory and confusing.\r"

  ".W": "From February 1982 through July 1987, the author studied 87 patients who had a total of 116 meniscus tears, 96 of which were repaired. Seventy patients (79 meniscus repairs) had postoperative followup ranging from 12 months to 5 1/2 years (mean, 39 months). The patients' ages ranged from 14 to 51 years with a mean age of 22. The time from injury to surgery ranged from 1 week to 6 years. Twenty-five percent of the injuries were considered acute, i.e., less than 6 weeks after the injury, and 75% of the injuries were considered chronic. Nineteen patients (27%) had isolated meniscus injuries. All meniscus repairs were done arthroscopically, using an inside-outside technique. Ligament stabilizing procedures were done on all patients who had ACL deficient knees. Forty-seven patients (67%) had postoperative documentation including either an arthroscopic examination or an arthrogram done an average of 5 to 6 months after surgery. There was one case of peroneal nerve palsy from which the patient made a complete recovery in 6 months. There was one case of infection/thrombophlebitis. One patient had paresthesia and numbness along the medial aspect of the left leg corresponding to a saphenous nerve injury. The aim of this investigation was two-fold, consisting of determining if an arthroscopic technique could be used successfully to repair acute as well as chronic vertical tears involving the meniscus, and also, evaluating the relationship between ACL stability and meniscus healing. The overall success rate of retained menisci following repair was 91%. The time from injury to repair did not affect meniscus healing. Associated stabilization of ACL deficiencies is imperative in patients undergoing meniscus repair.\r"

The results of the Gore-Tex polytetrafluoroethylene ligament, which is intended as a permanent replacement, are reported. Eighty-two patients were followed prospectively, mean age was 28 years (range, 16 to 51 years) and mean followup was 18 months (range, 12 to 30 months). Subjective scores improved in all categories, including pain, swelling, giving way, locking, and stair climbing. All patients without complications had no episodes of actual giving way, considered themselves improved, and returned to activities of daily living at 3 weeks and athletics at 8 months. Range of motion lacking at 3 months was 2 degrees of extension and 10 degrees of flexion, and at 12 months was 0 degrees of extension and 4 degrees of flexion. All mean objective data, including the anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift, demonstrated improvement at final followup. Cybex testing revealed improvement in relative quadriceps strength from 88% to 99%. The KT-1000 Arthrometer showed improvement in the injured-normal knee difference score throughout the follow-up period. Of importance is that while final objective data was improved over initial data, an early nonprogressive shift toward loosening was indicated by worsening of the drawer, Lachman, pivot shift, and KT-1000 scores. This shift may be attributed to resorption of interposed soft tissue, creep, or loosening of the graft. Subjective scores remained stable after improving. Complications included four ruptures, four chronic sterile effusions with partial attenuation, one infection, and one symptomatic loose body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All 11 patients had been tested preoperatively through all steps except the fifth. The group subjectively rated the postoperative knee as 83% of the preinjury status, an increase from a 53% mean prior to reconstruction. Six of 11 patients were able to return to their full preinjury level of competition, with or without a brace. Four patients had positive drawer tests, five had positive Lachman examinations, and all subjects had negative pivot shifts. Significant quadriceps torque deficits remained (P less than 0.0005), with the postoperative knee extensors approximately 85% of the contralateral limb. The involved limb hamstrings were equal in strength to the nonoperated limb. Radiographic evaluation revealed four, five, and four patients with positive findings of the patellofemoral joint, medial joint space, and lateral joint space, respectively. Only one patient had normal radiographs. Instrumented knee laxity testing revealed the operated knee to be significantly looser only during maximum passive displacement (7.2 mm versus 5.3 mm, P less than 0.01) and not during the other measurements. Biomechanical analysis of the straight cut maneuver revealed no significant differences between the nonoperated and operated limbs at the 2 year postoperative mark.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diagnosis was based on the findings of tenderness over the tibial collateral ligament at the joint line, without a history of mechanical symptoms. With a nonsurgical program, 62% of the patients improved and subsequently required no further treatment. Fifteen percent did not improve; of this group, one-third had a negative arthrogram or arthroscopy. Another 23% did not improve and ultimately underwent an arthroscopic partial medial meniscectomy. Tibial collateral ligament bursitis is an entity that should be considered in any patient with medial joint pain in the knee. Treatment is simple, effective, and offers low morbidity.\r"

Of 115 patients diagnosed and treated for semimembranosus tendinitis over a 5 year period, 10 patients were refractory to conservative treatment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the symptomatology and diagnosis of semi-membranous tendinitis, and to relate the treatment that these 10 patients underwent, i.e., surgical exploration, drilling of the insertion site, and semitendinosus tendon transfer. Most cases of semitendinosus tendinitis respond to conservative therapy; however, if surgical treatment is considered, arthroscopy should probably be performed at the time of surgery. In this way, it is possible to determine the presence of significant intraarticular abnormalities that may have a causal relationship with the onset of semimembranosus tendinitis.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty professional and recreational athletes underwent CT arthrography of the shoulder for evaluation of suspected shoulder joint derangement. These athletes, 46 males and 14 females ranging in age from 15 to 60 years (mean, 32 years), all had persistent pain that interfered with their sports activity and was resistant to conservative treatment. Seventeen patients had shoulder instability based on clinical manifestations and CT arthrographic findings. An additional five patients, also based on clinical manifestations and CT arthrographic findings, were considered to have an unobtrusive degree of anterior joint laxity. Patients with anterior instability (20 cases) all had an anteroinferior tear or detachment of the glenoid labrum, as well as some violation of the insertion of the joint capsule onto the scapula. Those with posterior instability (two cases) had a combination of labral and capsular tears. Two other major patterns of labral tears, both unaffiliated with shoulder instability, were identified. These included total or partial detachment of superior segments of the labrum, and anterior labral tears at the midglenoid level. Moreover, various degrees of labral attenuation (or, less often, enlargement), osteophyte formation, and alterations in articular cartilage were observed. Surgical correlation was obtained in 25 patients, with 95% accuracy of CT arthrographic findings. CT arthrography is a minimally invasive and highly accurate technique for investigation of glenohumeral derangement. Specifically, the extent of pathologic changes associated with instability can be determined and differentiated from other intraarticular causes of incapacity, such as labral tears caused by throwing, or degenerative changes.\r"

It is previously unreported as a complication of arthroscopic lateral retinacular release. Anterior knee pain was the only reported preoperative symptom in 14 knees. Sixteen knees had a preoperative diagnosis of lateral patellar subluxation on the basis of a positive apprehension sign only. Eighteen of 30 knees had no surgery of the extensor mechanism other than the arthroscopic lateral release. The remainder additionally underwent varying types and numbers of operations in an attempt to resolve their disability. CAT scan evaluation of three patients who volunteered for the procedure demonstrated severe atrophy and retraction of the vastus lateralis. Loss of this dynamic lateral stabilizer contributed to the medial subluxation of the patella.\r"

The majority of injuries were minor (73%) and only 8% were classified as major. Seventy-six percent of the injuries occurred during games and 24% during practice. The incidence of injury during practice was 1.4 per 1,000 player-practice hours and 78.4 per 1,000 player-game hours. In comparison with other sports, the incidence of injury during hockey practice is very low, while that during games is high. Eighty percent of the injuries were caused by trauma and 20% by overuse. The most common types of injury were contusions, strains, and sprains. Complete tear of the medial collateral ligament of the knee was the most common severe injury. Most injuries resulted from body contact, predominantly tackling (checking), and from puck or stick contact. A reduction of the number of minor and moderate injuries should be possible by stricter enforcement of the hockey rules, especially against stick violations, and more widespread use of visors.\r"

These were randomly divided into four exercise groups, varying protein consumption and anabolic hormone administration. Eight nonexercised control rats were kept separate from the study to act as a comparison for organ weight, hematology, and serology. Exercise consisted of a 30 minute swim three times a week. Parameters recorded were total body weight and percent gain, wet and dry muscle weight of the isolated anterior tibialis, weights of designated organs, hematologic profiles, and serum chemistries including triglycerides, high density and low density lipids. Histopathology of known \"target organs\" was performed and bone marrow aspirates were taken. Body weights of rats given anabolic steroid, protein supplement, and exercise were the lowest of all groups. Testicular weight was significantly decreased in the anabolic groups. Anabolic groups had the lowest hematocrits of the exercised groups. All serology values were within normal ranges and no pathologic changes were seen in any of the tissues taken from specific \"target organs.\"\r"

Data were gathered on demographics, exercise behavior, and environmental conditions during a 1 week period. Most of the subjects (66%) engaged in aerobic dance classes at least every other day, with a mean exercise time of 195 minutes per week. Twenty-eight percent of the subjects had been exercising 1 to 2 years, and 26% had been exercising 2 years or longer. Forty-nine percent of the subjects reported a history of at least one injury related to aerobic dancing. Most of the injuries were to the shin (24.5%), lower back (12.9%), and ankle (12.2%). Among those subjects injured, 23% reportedly saw a physician because of their injury. The frequency with which subjects exercised was associated with a history of injury. Subjects who exercised fewer than four times per week reported fewer injuries (43%) than those who exercised four times per week (60%) or more (66%). This study is a first step toward providing data to help physicians counsel aerobic dancers regarding injury prevention.\r"

  ".W": "Currently used measures of knee stability and function for ACL reconstructed knees have not gained universal acceptance. Clinical test results often are given more value than the patient's subjective evaluation of the surgical outcome. This study was designed to identify specific knee stability and function variables that were most predictive of the patient's rating of knee function following one of two types of combined (intraarticular and extraarticular) ACL reconstruction procedures. Individual measures of knee stability and function were also evaluated for differences between contralateral operated and nonoperated limbs. Postoperative and healthy contralateral knees of 51 male and female patients aged 18 to 49 years (mean, 23.7 years) were evaluated on a battery of tests at an average of 48.0 months after surgery (range, 24 to 101 months). All subjects possessed a normal contralateral knee for comparative purposes. The results of this retrospective study indicated that the variables selected were not highly correlated with, nor could they effectively predict, the patients' perceptions of postoperative knee status as measured by the Knee Function Rating Form (KFR). Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.001) between operated and nonoperated knees were found for 9 of 11 variables analyzed. The data suggest that patients' perceptions of postoperative knee status were independent of the results of static and dynamic clinical tests commonly used to assess knee stability and function. Postoperative deficits of up to 30% between the surgically reconstructed and normal contralateral knees on specific measures of knee stability and function did not greatly influence the patients' perceptions of knee function. Development of new, more specific dynamic tests may be necessary before stronger relationships between clinical test results and patients' perceptions of knee status in the ACL reconstructed knee can be realized.\r"

A review of the initial 60 patients with a minimum of 4 years followup (average, 5.5 years) has been concluded. Thirty-eight patients returned for examinations, and 11 returned questionnaires. Associated medial procedures were performed in 29 of the 38 examined patients. Medial meniscus surgery was performed in 86% and lateral meniscus surgery in 28.9%. At followup, giving way, which was the main preoperative complaint, was eliminated in 30/38 examined and 9/11 questionnaire patients (79%). In the examined group, three patients were clear failures and five had mild transient instability. The pivot shift was present in 17 of 38 (45%) patients examined: 21 patients were negative, 9 were 1+ or a grind, 8 were 2+, and none were 3+. We have concluded that the QTS procedure will eliminate symptomatic instability in 79% of our patients, but the high rate of a residual pivot shift (45%) and symptoms of instability (21%) require the addition of an extraarticular sling procedure. This appears to be related to the relatively poor strength characteristics of the tissue used in the QTS substitution.\r"

We studied a group of patients with these injuries to determine possible predisposing factors that could aid in early detection and prevention of contralateral ACL injury. Retrospective analysis of 1,120 patients with ACL ruptures who were treated between 1983 and 1987 revealed 45 patients with bilateral ruptures. Complete follow-up data were available for 41 of these patients. We examined age at initial injury, sex, interval between initial and contralateral ACL injury, mechanism of injury, activity at injury, medical and family histories, treatment of initial injury, and radiographic measurement of intercondylar notch width. The overall incidence of bilaterality was 4.01% in the 28 male and 13 female patients. Their average age was 19 years and 10 months. The average interval between initial and contralateral injury was 47 months. A noncontact cutting maneuver was the most common mechanism of injury. We devised a method to measure and compare intercondylar notch widths on plain radiographs. We compared the mean notch width index (NWI) of the bilateral group to the mean NWI of a group of 50 consecutive patients with \"normal\" knees and to the mean NWI of 50 consecutive patients with acute ACL ruptures. The mean NWI for the normal group was .2338, for the acute ACL group, .2248, and for the bilateral group, .1961. We noted a statistically significant difference when we compared the bilateral group to the normal and acute groups (P less than 0.0001, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the NWI of the normal and acute ACL groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postoperative immobilization was at either 30 degrees (N = 17) or 70 degrees (N = 12) of knee flexion for 6 weeks. All patients then followed a common preparatory training program for 8 weeks. In the 14th postoperative week the patients were put on either progressive resistance training (N = 12) or isokinetic training (N = 17) for 6 weeks, after which all had identical training. Independent of primary knee immobilization angle or training regimens, no differences could be demonstrated with respect to stability, range of motion, function, or isokinetic mechanical output. For all patients, Lysholm knee function score improved from 60.5 to 93.6 (P less than 0.001) and activity level from 3.9 to 6.3 (P less than 0.001). Isokinetic peak torque, contractional work, and mean power of the quadriceps at 30, 90, and 180 deg/sec were lower in the injured compared to the noninjured leg (78% to 90%; P less than 0.01) both preoperatively and at followup, and there were no significant differences between the preoperative and follow-up values. Clinical stability improved (P less than 0.001) in 19 of the 29 patients (66%) and in 11 of those 17 patients with early isokinetic training (65%). Performance tests were normal in 23 of 29 patients (79%), with minor abnormalities in the rest.\r"

Postsurgical success was defined as patient resumption of required activities without symptom recurrence, over a period of 5 years after surgery. The four rehabilitation methods studied were programs of no exercise, home exercise, isotonic exercise, and isokinetic exercise. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences at the P = 0.05 level for comparison of the isokinetic exercise to the other methods on the basis of rehabilitation interval (isokinetic, 8.9 +/- 3.7 weeks; isotonic, 12.3 +/- 6.1 weeks; home, 10.0 +/- 4.5 weeks) and correlation to success (isokinetic, r = 0.92, isotonic, r = 0.48, home, r = 0.09, no exercise, r = 0.00). It was concluded that rehabilitation methods that incorporate isokinetic exercise are more efficient and effective than nonisokinetic programs in the long-term successful management of postsurgical knee patients.\r"

Twenty male patients with complete acromioclavicular separation within the preceding 13 months were retrospectively examined and tested for recovery of shoulder strength and function. Comparisons were conducted between 10 of the patients who had been treated nonsurgically (Group 1), and 10 who had been treated surgically (Group 2). An additional group of 10 uninjured male subjects as controls was also tested for comparison of strength between dominant and nondominant limbs (Group 3). All of the patients were tested for strength of both shoulders using the Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer, for shoulder flexibility using the Leighton flexometer, and for grip strength using a standard grip dynamometer. A questionnaire concerning patient evaluation of the injury was also administered to all of the subjects. The majority of strength and flexibility tests showed no significant differences between the nonsurgical and surgical groups. The nonsurgical group was statistically superior to the surgical group in the following test scores: eccentric abduction (fast speeds), concentric external rotation (slow speeds), eccentric external rotation (fast), eccentric abduction (slow), and flexibility in external rotation. These findings generally indicated that the nonsurgical treatment of a third-degree acromioclavicular separation is superior in restoring normal shoulder function in the 1st year following injury.\r"

An understanding of the complex sequences of muscle activity in this area may help reduce injury, enhance performance, and assist the rapid rehabilitation of the injured athlete. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, middle deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii, and serratus anterior muscles were studied in six uninjured male Division II collegiate tennis players using dynamic electromyography (EMG) and synchronized high-speed photography. Each subject performed the tennis serve and the forehand and backhand groundstrokes, and each stroke was divided into stages. The tennis serve contains four stages. Three stages characterize the forehand and backhand groundstrokes. Our results indicate that the subscapularis, pectoralis major, and serratus anterior display the greatest activity during the serve and forehand. The middle deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus are most active in the acceleration and follow-through stages of the backhand. The biceps brachii increases its activity during cocking and follow-through in the serve with a similar pattern noted in the acceleration and follow-through stages of the forehand and backhand. The serratus anterior demonstrates intense activity in the serve and forehand, thus providing a stable platform for the humeral head and assisting in gleno-humeral-scapulothoracic synchrony. The tennis serve and forehand and backhand groundstrokes are accomplished by complex sequences of muscle activity that incorporate contributions from the lower extremities and trunk into smooth, coordinated patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The brace was removed at a mean of 90 days. Clinical results were excellent; there was minimal persistence of knee or ankle limitation; 84% of the patients had less than 5 mm of final shortening; 96% had less than 4 degrees of final angulation. Work was resumed at a mean of 103 days. We had one nonunion, which we treated operatively 6 months after injury by osteosynthesis and autologous bone grafting. All of the patients were asked to complete a questionnaire; 51% responded, with an average followup of 5 years (range, 1 to 10 years).

Anterior talofibular ligament laxity, with or without calcaneofibular laxity and other abnormalities, is often present in conjunction with peroneus brevis tendon tears, abnormal ligament placement, tibialis posterior tendon tears, osteochondritis dissecans, arthritis, synovitis, loose bodies, and tarsal coalition. Surgical reconstructions were performed on 43 ankles using a split peroneus brevis tendon graft routed through osseous tunnels in the talus, fibula, and calcaneus and resutured to the reconstructed anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. The tunnel locations, transfer routes, and tendon reinforcement were modifications based on the Elmslie procedure. Good and excellent results were achieved in 91% of the patients. Ninety-eight percent of the patients achieved stability. Followup was from 9 months to 11 years. Twenty-one patients had preoperative and intraoperative findings that required additional procedures. Thorough evaluation of patients with lateral ankle instability syndrome increases the frequency of finding associated abnormalities, which if left uncorrected, may adversely affect the outcome of surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Three-plane kinesiology of hindfoot instability was studied after lesions to the ligamentous structures in the sinus and canalis tarsi in 20 amputation specimens. Neither a lesion of the cervical ligament nor of the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament resulted in an increase in the total range of movements above 2.6 degrees in any of the three planes. However, the percentage increase in the total range of movements after cutting of the ligaments was generally largest in the talocalcaneal joint compared to the increase in the total hindfoot joint complex. The largest percentage increase (43%) in the talocalcaneal joint occurred at dorsiflexion after cutting the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. The demonstrated minor instability after experimental lesions of the ligamentous structures in the sinus and canalis tarsi may have a clinical identity in the sinus tarsi syndrome. Patients with that syndrome rarely present an objective hindfoot instability, although a major complaint is a feeling of hindfoot instability.\r"

Upon division of these structures, complete relief was obtained in 52 of the 59 patients.\r"

A history of trauma was associated with the lesion in 38% of the cases, and the lesion was bilateral in one out of four patients. The most common presenting complaints were subpatellar pain and swelling. The most common initial physical findings were patellofemoral crepitus and joint effusion. Forty-four operations were performed on 31 knees. The most commonly performed procedures were curettage of the patella and removal of loose bodies, in combination or as part of another procedure. A new patellofemoral rating scale was used to evaluate results. Thirty-eight percent of the knees had a good or excellent result, while 62% had a fair or poor result. Persistent pain with restricted function and residual patellofemoral crepitus were common findings. In general, the patients who come to surgery for OCD of the patella have a guarded prognosis for full recovery of knee function.\r"

We developed a surveillance system for the 1985 National Boy Scout Jamboree to determine the incidence, nature, and cause of injuries among participants. To characterize the more severe injuries among scouts, we monitored referral visits to an onsite Army hospital. During the 9 day event there was a total of 179 injuries requiring referral visits among the 24,885 scouts, for an overall incidence of 8.5 injuries per 10,000 person-days. Twenty-eight injuries (16%) involved fractures. Ten injuries required hospitalization, for an overall rate of 0.5 per 10,000 person-days. Thirty-six (20%) of the injuries occurred during six organized athletic activities. Of these six, two new Jamboree activities, the bucking bronco and bicycle motocross racing, had the highest event-specific rates, 14.4 and 11.4 injuries per 10,000 participants, respectively. These two events also accounted for one-third of all fractures. In contrast, there were no firearm-related injuries among the 32,616 participants in riflery events. This simple and inexpensive surveillance system provided a mechanism for monitoring activity modifications, as well as useful information for the selection and planning of organized activities at future Jamborees and similar recreational events.\r"

Fifteen different aerobic bacteria or fungi were collected from pure cultures. A total of 30 specimens were sprayed; 2 specimens of each of the 15 bacteria were sprayed with ethyl chloride for both 5 and 10 seconds. These specimens then were restreaked once the ethyl chloride had evaporated, and were incubated for 24 hours. At 24 hours the cultures were checked and found to have no significant growth inhibitions. It is thus concluded that ethyl chloride alone does not have any bacteriostatic or cidal effects on these commonly found skin flora.\r"

A commercially available, modified hematological apparatus (the QBC tube) was used for centrifugation. Red blood cells infected with diverse stages of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are lighter than noninfected cells and somewhat heavier than granulocytes; thus they can readily be detected by direct inspection of UV-illuminated tubes. About 10% of infections diagnosed by direct centrifugal microscopy in a clinical setting were not detected by conventional examination of stained thick films. Diagnosis by direct centrifugation appears to be at least 8 times as sensitive as conventional microscopy when applied to serially diluted samples of malaria-infected blood. Superior sensitivity, together with the one step, solid state nature of the direct centrifugal procedure, provides important advantages for malaria diagnosis.\r"

Infections were studied in 3 New World species (10 Callicebus moloch, 1 C. torquatus, and 2 Aotus trivirgatus) and 3 Old World species (8 Macaca mulatta, 6 Erythrocebus patas, and 1 Cercopithecus aethiops). Amebiasis was recorded as the principal or a contributing cause of death of all of the 13 New World monkeys and in 6 of the 15 Old World monkeys; amebiasis was detected in the rest of the monkeys only after tissues were re-examined specifically for amebae. Amebae causing no apparent damage were found in the lamina propriae, mainly at the muscularis mucosae. Most frequent were colonies or aggregates of amebae in the crypts between the epithelium and basement membrane, causing either no evident necrosis or changes ranging from necrosis and disarrangement of adjacent cells to complete destruction of the epithelium and reduction of the cells to pyknotic bodies. A lesion interpreted as possibly characteristic of carrier-state invasive amebiasis was destruction of the epithelium in patches of mucosal crypts, not leading to ulceration. Uncommon but present in both New and Old World monkeys were typical areas of surface erosion and classical flask-shaped ulcers. The observations show that in some species of Old World monkeys amebiasis can be invasive without causing clinical disease.\r"

During the 2nd year of infection, there was unintentional exposure to two additional larvae. Egg counts per gram of feces (EPG) were approximately 1,000 during the 1st year, 1,500 over the next 5 years, and less than or equal to 200 over the final 3 years, during which time there were 6 periods of approximately 1 month each when Kato thick-smear examinations revealed no eggs. During 6 of the 1st 14 years, when egg counts were done by the standard direct smear method, up to 37% of the eggs were infertile. Based on the assumption that two female worms were present during the 1st year, three during the next 3 years or more, and only one during the final 3 years, the estimated output per female in this light infection was 500 EPG in the worm's prime of life, and less than 200 EPG in the final year of the 17 or 18 year life span.\r"

Three weeks after larval challenge the chambers were removed and live larvae were enumerated. Seven months after challenge dogs were killed and necropsied to collect and count adult D. immitis. Chambers recovered from immunized dogs had 63% fewer larvae than chambers from control dogs. At necropsy, control dogs had a mean of 28.5 adult worms whereas the immunized animals had an average of 0.5 worms (range 0-2). Sera collected from immune dogs throughout the study had elevated antibody levels to third- and fourth-larval stage antigens. Significant levels of immune protection were achieved with this immunization regimen. The data suggest that a multiple-stage parasite killing occurs in immune animals. It was not possible to associate immune protection with any of the 5 antigen subsets.\r"

Excretory-secretory antigens in serum were first detected 154 days postinfection. Serum antibodies directed against parasite ES antigens were detected by ELISA in all dogs. Kidney tissue elution studies were performed in 10 dogs, and antibody and parasite ES antigens were demonstrated in each case. Antibody or parasite antigen was not detected in serum, urine, or kidney eluates from uninfected dogs. At peak concentrations of the ES antigens in serum, there were correlations with the number of adult D. immitis present in the dogs (r2 = 23.8, P less than 0.05) and with the antigen concentration in kidney eluates (r2 = 73.5, P less than 0.001). Peak serum antibody concentrations were not correlated with either the number of adult worms or the antibody concentrations in kidney eluates. This study suggests that detection of parasite antigens in urine may be an important diagnostic aid. In addition, the correlation between the concentration of D. immitis ES antigens in kidney tissue and in serum without a similar correlation between serum and kidney antibody concentrations suggests that D. immitis ES antigens adhere to kidney tissue.\r"

Serum from 319 cows, 88 dogs, 122 equines, 47 swine, 10 goats, and 4 cats were tested for neutralizing antibody to LACV, JCV, trivittatus (TVTV), and snowshoe hare (SSHV) viruses. Antibody prevalences of LACV, TVTV, and SSHV were less than 10% in all species. Antibody to JCV was detected in all species except cats. Prevalence ranged from 10% in goats and swine to 29% in dogs. No age-associated trends in JCV prevalence were noted. Two of 6 adult dogs, and 2 of 4 pigs inoculated with 6.3-6.5 log10 suckling mouse intracerebral 50% lethal doses (SMICLD50) of LACV developed viremias ranging of less than 1.0-2.9 log10 SMICLD50/ml 1-3 days after inoculation. Of 4 puppies inoculated with LACV, 3 developed fatal infections. Viremias were not detected in 4 cows, 4 ponies, 7 cats, or 6 sheep. Two cats fed LACV infected suckling mice shed virus from the oropharynx for 1 day each. All animals except 1 cow, 1 cat, and 1 sheep had greater than or equal to 4-fold rise in antibody titers. Five additional dogs fed upon by LACV-infected Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes did not develop viremias or antibody and uninfected Ae. triseriatus engorging on the dogs 1-5 days after feeding by infected mosquitoes failed to become infected. Five ponies, 6 calves, 2 ewes, 6 dogs, and 5 piglets were inoculated with 3.6-7.3 log10 SMICLD50 of JCV. None developed detectable viremias, although greater than or equal to 4-fold rises in antibody titers developed in 60% of the ponies, 17% of the calves, 50% of the dogs, and 1 of 2 ewes. None of the pigs developed corresponding rises in antibody titers. We conclude that juvenile and adult animals of the species tested are not efficient amplifier hosts of LACV or JCV, but may be useful sentinels of local virus transmission.\r"

The primary tumor sites were the esophagus (21 patients), gastroduodenum (33 patients), liver and gallbladder (6 patients), pancreas (15 patients), colorectum (101 patients), lymphoproliferative disorders (35 patients), abdominal carcinomatosis (45 patients), genitourinary and gynecologic systems (94 patients), and other sites (15 patients). One hundred eighty-two patients (49 percent) had 1 or more complications (grouped as gastrointestinal, septic, cardiopulmonary, and nonseptic) and 47 patients died (12.9 percent). The 145 patients who underwent a palliative procedure had the highest morbidity and mortality rates (41 percent and 21 percent, respectively). In the 168 patients who had curative resection, the morbidity and mortality rates were 39 percent and 9 percent, respectively, and in 51 patients with a diagnostic laparotomy, 20 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Age was not a contributory factor. The 177 malnourished patients had a significantly higher incidence of complications (72 percent) and postoperative death (23 percent) than the well-nourished patients (29 percent and 4 percent, respectively; p less than 0.001). These differences also existed with each form of complication. Of those patients without complications, the majority resumed consuming 60 percent of their caloric requirements by postoperative day 9. In the majority of patients with complications, resumption of adequate oral intake occurred by postoperative day 20.\r"

Eight of these patients presented with focal transient ischemic attacks, two with strokes, and four with vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Recurrent symptoms in eight patients were similar to those prompting the initial carotid endarterectomy. Symptoms recurred early after previous carotid endarterectomy in 2 patients and late in 12 patients. Eleven patients underwent repeat endarterectomy and carotid patch angioplasty, two patients underwent patch angioplasty alone, and one patient underwent carotid artery replacement with a vein graft. Persistent or recurrent focal symptoms referable to the reoperated carotid artery were not present during follow-up (mean 27.4 months, range 4 to 79 months). Vertebrobasilar symptoms were relieved by carotid reoperation in each patient. Although the natural history of asymptomatic postoperative carotid restenosis is unknown, reluctance to reoperate on symptomatic patients is unwarranted, since carotid reoperation can be performed safely with the expectation that recurrent focal and nonfocal vertebrobasilar symptoms will be relieved.\r"

More recently, prophylaxis has become a frequent indication for patients with extensive deep vein thrombosis and contraindications to anticoagulation. Herein, we review a recent series of caval filter insertions to determine if increased utilization of this technique is justified in terms of morbidity and effectiveness. Twenty-one filters were inserted in 20 patients during a 1-year period. The operative mortality rate was 0 and satisfactory filter placement was achieved in 90 percent of patients. There were no documented instances of recurrent emboli or vena cava thrombosis. These data suggest that use of the filter is justified as prophylaxis for patients at high risk for an initial pulmonary embolus in a clinical setting where heparin therapy is not appropriate.\r"

There was no statistically significant association between previous cholecystectomy and the risk of colorectal cancer, colon cancer, right colon cancer, any of the subsites of colon cancer, rectal cancer, age, or sex. Although there is some evidence from other studies of an association between previous cholecystectomy and right colon cancer in women, this may have resulted from confounding symptoms. Based on the present evidence, we believe that previous cholecystectomy is unlikely to be a risk factor for colorectal cancer.\r"

The 30-day mortality rate was 14 percent (5 of 35 patients). Of the remaining 30 patients, endoprosthesis placement was successful in 28, with 2 patients discharged with a permanent external drainage catheter. Twenty-four patients survived a median of 3 months (range 1 to 17 months), and 2 were lost to follow-up. Good or fair palliation of symptoms was achieved in 50 percent of the discharged patients and in 66 percent of those living longer than 3 months. We believe that percutaneous transhepatic endoprostheses can provide useful palliation in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, even in the presence of advanced disease.\r"

Operative morbidity included four subphrenic abscesses, one bile leak, one bile duct injury, one case of cholestasis, and one case of phlebitis. There were no operative deaths. The median survival of the patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was 40 months, and the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 35 percent. Survival rates were not significantly different between patients with a solitary metastasis and those with multiple lesions and was not influenced by size of the metastases. However, survival was significantly better in patients whose primary colorectal lesion was Dukes' B as compared with those whose lesion was Dukes' C. The results indicate that liver resection can be performed safely with acceptable morbidity and improved long-term survival.\r"

This difference is not explained by the transfused patients being older, having a less favorable clinical stage of disease, or less differentiated tumor histology. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the additional risk of dying from prostate cancer was 2.82-fold higher in transfused patients than in those not transfused. As in previous studies, the risk of recurrence may be greater in those receiving whole blood transfusions. Prospective studies of the association between perioperative blood transfusion and cancer recurrence are needed. For the present, prudent clinical practice should include avoidance of whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet transfusions and greater reliance on autologous blood transfusions.\r"

Monoclonal antibody B72.3 was injected 5 to 42 days preoperatively, and the hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used intraoperatively to detect the presence of tumor. Intraoperative probe counts of less than 20 every 2 seconds, or tumor-to-adjacent normal tissue ratios less than 2:1 were considered negative (system failure). Positive probe counts were detected in 5 of 6 patients with primary colon cancer (83 percent), in 31 of 39 patients with recurrent colon cancer (79 percent), in 4 of 5 patients with gastric cancer (80 percent), in 3 of 8 patients with breast cancer (37.5 percent), and in 4 of 8 patients with ovarian cancer (50 percent) undergoing second-look procedures. Additional patients in each group were scored as borderline positive. Overall, radioimmunoguided surgery using B72.3 identified tumors in 47 patients (71.2 percent), bordered on positive in 6 patients (9.1 percent), and failed to identify tumor in 13 patients (19.7 percent). Improved selection of patients for antigen-positive tumors, the use of higher affinity second-generation antibodies, alternate routes of antibody administration, alternate radionuclides, and more sophisticatedly bioengineered antibodies and antibody combinations should all lead to improvements in radioimmunoguided surgery.\r"

The relationships between the timing of surgery, the severity of pancreatitis, and the surgical outcome were examined. Patients were divided into three groups according to the timing of surgery and into four groups according to the gross pancreatic pathologic characteristics observed at operation. Patients who underwent surgery early tended to have a higher incidence of common bile duct stones and more severe forms of pancreatitis; however, neither the timing of surgery nor the severity of pancreatitis had a significant impact on surgical outcome. Other factors, such as the level of serum amylase on admission and presence or absence of choledocholithiasis, did not significantly influence the natural history of the disease or the outcome of surgical therapy, whereas advanced age was associated with higher morbidity. Hemodynamic status and the overall condition of the patients were more important than either the timing of surgery or the gross pathologic characteristics of the pancreas in determining surgical outcome. We conclude that the timing of surgery is not a critical factor in the outcome of surgery for acute gallstone pancreatitis. Provided that the patient is stable and has no medical contraindications, surgery on the biliary tract can be performed safely at any time after initial resuscitation of the patient and confirmation of diagnosis.\r"

Membranes were incubated for 90 minutes in a closed system with 3HNTP and increasing concentrations of halothane. The amount of 3HNTP bound to membranes was quantified by radioligand binding technique and liquid scintillation counting. It was found in both the rat and rabbit cardiac membranes that halothane (0.4-2.0%) caused a dose-dependent decrease in specific 3HNTP binding (P less than 0.0001). The decrease in 3HNTP binding caused by halothane was also found to be reversible. These results indicate that halothane interferes with one property of the Ca2+ channel and suggest that this may be one possible mechanism for the negative inotropic action of halothane.\r"

  ".W": "Because the volatile anesthetics depress the entry of calcium (Ca) into myocardial cells and also alter release of intracellular Ca stores, additional pharmacologic blockade of Ca entry could potentially enhance anesthetic-induced depression. The depressant effects of the calcium entry blocker diltiazem combined with the volatile anesthetics halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane were investigated in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle. Muscle contractions were studied in normal Tyrode solution after rest and at stimulation rates of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 Hz. Anesthetics were studied in the presence of 0.1 and 1 microM diltiazem, which depressed tension to approximately 85 and 55% of control at 2-3 Hz, respectively; depression at the higher concentration was frequency-dependent. Depressant effects of enflurane were determined as previously done for equianesthetic concentrations (approximately 1 and 2 MAC) of halothane and isoflurane. At all stimulation rates, 1.7 and 3.5% enflurane depressed peak tension and dT/dt-max to approximately 73 and 50% of the mean control-recovery value, respectively. After control measurements of contractile characteristics, effects of 0.1 microM diltiazem were determined alone and then with the addition of halothane (0.75 or 1.5%), isoflurane (1.3 or 2.5%), or enflurane (1.7 or 3.5%), respectively. Recovery from anesthetic was then determined in the continued presence of diltiazem. After rest and at rates less than or equal to 0.5 Hz, equianesthetic concentrations of these volatile agents caused similar depression in the presence of diltiazem. At 3 Hz stimulation rate, 1.3% isoflurane caused significantly less contractile depression than did 1.7% enflurane or than 0.75% halothane. At 2-MAC concentrations, differences among the anesthetics were more apparent: 2.5% isoflurane depressed peak tension and dT/dt-max less than did halothane at 1-3 Hz stimulation rates, and depressed dT/dt-max less than 3.5% enflurane at 2-3 Hz. Similar frequency-dependent differences in depression by approximately 2 MAC anesthetics were observed in the presence of 1 microM diltiazem. The patterns of depressant action by the volatile anesthetics were similar to those previously observed in the absence of diltiazem. Furthermore, when the volatile anesthetic depression of contractions was combined with the depression due to diltiazem-induced blockade of Ca entry, the resulting contractile depression did not differ significantly from a prediction that assumed simply additive effects.\r"

The comparative effects of ropivacaine and bupivacaine on motor function were assessed in the laboratory rat and dog. (It was not possible to accurately evaluate sensory blockade in these models.) Several concentrations of both agents were injected in the region of the sciatic nerve of the rat and into the lumbar epidural or subarachoid space in the dog. Epidural blockade was also performed utilizing solutions of ropivacaine and bupivacaine which contained epinephrine (1:200,000). The rat sciatic block studies indicate that at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.75%, ropivacaine had a slightly shorter time of onset and duration of motor blockade than did bupivacaine. In the epidural and spinal studies in the dog, ropivacaine was less potent and had a shorter duration of motor blockade than did bupivacaine at equal drug concentrations. A 1.0% solution of ropivacaine produced epidural motor blockade similar in onset and duration to that achieved with a 0.75% solution of bupivacaine. Epinephrine did not significantly prolong the duration of motor blockade of either agent after epidural administration.\r"

The elimination half life (t 1/2 beta) of ropivacaine (25.9 +/- 1.7 min) was significantly shorter than for bupivacaine (39.1 +/- 13.3 min) after IV infusion. This was reflected by mean clearance values (Cl) for ropivacaine of 41.1 +/- 8.2 ml.min-1.kg-1 compared with 32.3 +/- 4.8 ml.min-1.kg-1 for bupivacaine, although the difference was not statistically significant.

Although Cmax tended to be higher for ropivacaine, a significant difference was only attained when comparing Cmax after administration of 0.25% plain solutions of both agents. The addition of epinephrine did not consistently decrease the Cmax of either agent. The apparent t 1/2 beta of both agents was significantly longer after epidural administration than after IV infusion. No differences existed between t 1/2 beta values for ropivacaine and bupivacaine after epidural administration. Total body clearance of both agents tended to be lower after epidural administration, particularly when epinephrine-containing solutions were employed. Little difference existed between the two drugs when equivalent solutions were administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 15 patients, the cardiovascular effects of equipotent levels of halothane were compared with and without N2O. In 16 patients, the cardiovascular effects of isoflurane with and without N2O were compared. Prior to anesthesia induction, cardiovascular measurements of heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP), and two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography were recorded. The echocardiographic measurements were used to determine cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume (LVEDV and LVESV). Twenty minutes after mask inhalation induction with halothane or isoflurane with N2O and O2 (3:2 liters/min), cardiovascular measurements were repeated with end-expired halothane or isoflurane maintained at 0.9 MAC. A third set of cardiovascular data was collected 10 minutes after the discontinuation of N2O, with inspired isoflurane or halothane levels in O2 (5 liters/min) increased to maintain 1.5 MAC end-expired levels. Ventilation was controlled throughout the study period and the study was completed before intubation and the start of elective surgery. Heart rate and MBP decreased to similar degrees below awake levels in both patient groups during N2O with halothane or isoflurane. When N2O was discontinued and end-expired levels of halothane or isoflurane increased, MBP remained at levels observed during N2O-O2 with halothane or isoflurane. Heart rate increased during isoflurane in O2. Cardiac output decreased significantly and similarly below awake levels during both halothane of isoflurane with and without N2O.\r"

An 8-MHz pulsed Doppler blood flowmeter was used to determine brachial artery diameter and flow characteristics. Measurements were made before and during sympathetic stimulation induced by a contralateral isometric handgrip. The lower level of sensory blockade (T11) in the absence of sympathetic stimulation was associated with decreases in right atrial pressure, brachial artery diameter (3.9 +/- 0.2 vs 4.2 +/- 0.2 mm, P less than 0.05) and brachial blood flow (42 +/- 5 vs 66 +/- 7 ml.min-1, p less than 0.001), whereas forearm vascular resistance increased significantly (2.2 +/- 0.3 vs 1.5 +/- 0.2 mm Hg.ml-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). Neither heart rate nor mean arterial pressure changed. At the higher level of blockade (T7), right atrial pressure and systemic arterial pressure decreased further without change in heart rate. Brachial artery diameter (3.8 +/- 0.2 mm) remained unchanged while brachial blood flow additionally decreased (30 +/- 3 ml.min, P less than 0.05), and forearm vascular resistances further increased (3.0 +/- 0.2 mm Hg.ml-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). Changes in heart rate and in mean arterial pressure associated with isometric exercise were similar before and during epidural anesthesia at both levels of epidural blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A whole body plethysmographic technique was used to measure minute volumes of breathing. The ED50s of subcutaneously injected morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, and sufentanil in depressing the minute volume response to 8% CO2 in air were 2300 micrograms/kg, 8800 micrograms/kg, 20 micrograms/kg, and 2.3 micrograms/kg, respectively. These doses were nearly the same as the subcutaneous ED50s of these compounds in producing analgesia, found in an earlier study. Roughly equianalgesic doses of the four opiates after epidural injection, however, failed to cause any detectable respiratory effect. Fourfold greater doses increased significantly the incidence of low minute volumes with fentanyl and sufentanil, but soon after epidural injection, i.e., at the time that analgesia was produced. None of the epidurally injected opiates had a significant delayed effect on respiration. However, one of the seven rats treated epidurally with the higher dose of morphine developed depression of the minute volume response to 8% CO2 in air as late as 7 hours after the injection. We conclude that epidural injection, in contrast to subcutaneous injection, of analgesic doses of morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, and sufentanil produces no significant respiratory effects.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a double-blind study of the dose-response relationship of intrathecal morphine (0, 0.3, 1, and 2.5 mg) for postoperative pain relief in 33 subjects who underwent total knee or hip replacement surgery. Assessments commenced 1 hour after the opioid injection, which was given at the end of surgery, and continued for 24 hours. Pain measurements, supplementary analgesia requirements, and adverse effects were recorded. Intrathecal morphine provided effective, long-lasting pain relief. All doses delayed the initial perception of discomfort (T-Pain) and also postponed the onset of severe pain requiring analgetic supplementation (T-Morphine) (1.25 hours control with placebo injections; greater than 20 hours with intrathecal morphine 0.3, 1, and 2.5 mg: P less than 0.05). Although 0.3 mg usually provided good analgesia it was unsatisfactory in three of 10 patients (30%), whereas 1 and 2.5 mg were absolutely reliable. Respiratory depression (increased PaCO2), common after the administration of 1 or 2.5 mg intrathecal morphine, was slow in onset and prolonged. The respiratory depression after 2.5 mg was more profound than after 1 mg, and produced apnea necessitating large-dose naloxone therapy. Pruritus was unique to intrathecal morphine administration, but nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention were common in all the groups. We conclude that no ideal dose of intrathecal morphine exists because, even with small quantities, minor adverse effects are evident. Doses between 0.3 and 1 mg, however, should provide good analgesia free from the major complication, respiratory depression.\r"

  ".W": "Large doses of atracurium (1.5 mg/kg) (six times the ED95) can result in significant histamine release, resulting in systemic hypotension. The efficacy of histamine receptor blockade in attenuating atracurium induced hypotension was therefore studied. Four groups of seven patients each were studied: group I, control; group II, H1 blockade (1 mg/kg diphenhydramine); group III, H2 blockade (cimetidine 4 mg/kg); and group IV, H1 and H2 blockade (diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg and cimetidine 4 mg/kg). All patients were anesthetized with an intravenous narcotic-nitrous oxide technique and then given 1.5 mg/kg atracurium. In group I, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased 30 mm Hg after 2 minutes and remained 25 mm Hg below baseline at 3 minutes, a change significantly greater than that in group IV, in which MAP decreased 8 and 7 mm Hg, respectively. H1 receptor blockade was associated with no significant attenuation of changes in MAP. H2 receptor blockade alone was associated with significant decreases in MAP, possibly secondary to enhanced release of histamine via an antagonist effect on recently described H3 receptors. Plasma histamine levels increased significantly 2 minutes after atracurium administration and correlated with hemodynamic changes. It is concluded that combined H1 and H2 receptor blockade attenuates cardiovascular effects associated with large doses of atracurium in humans. Histamine-releasing agents may be contraindicated in patients subject to chronic H2 receptor blockade.\r"

Twelve animals also received 0.7 Vol% and 1.4 Vol% isoflurane; six time-related controls received piritramid only. Surgical preparation consisted of a left thoracotomy for inserting a catheter into the left atrium for microsphere injections and for gaining access to the hepatic surface through an incision in the diaphragm. Parameters in the animals receiving isoflurane were recorded at three stages: stage 1--piritramid anesthesia after surgical preparation; stage 2-60 min after addition of 0.7 Vol% (end-expiratory) isoflurane; stage 3-60 min after addition of 1.4 Vol% (end-expiratory) isoflurane. Hepatic surface oxygen tension was determined at each stage using an eight-channel oxygen sensitive electrode. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac output decreased during both stages with isoflurane; hepatic arterial inflow remained constant. Portal blood flow and, hence, total hepatic inflow decreased significantly. An unchanged splanchnic O2 consumption induced lower hepatic venous pO2 values: 40 +/- 1 mmHg at control, 35 +/- 2 mmHg, and 31 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SEM; both P less than 0.05) during isoflurane. A concomitant decrease of hepatic surface pO2 values indicated an altered tissue oxygenation. The percentage of hepatic surface pO2 values in the lowest pO2 range (0-5 mmHg) increased significantly from 8.4 to 20.3% during 1.4 Vol% isoflurane; the percentage of values of 0 mmHg increased from 2.4 to 9.8% during 1.4 Vol.%. No changes of these parameters were detected in the control animals during the 3-h observation period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In experiment 1 muscles were stimulated by field electrodes (0.2 Hz) to obtain control measurements of developed tension (dt) and maximal rate of tension development (dF/dt) prior to exposing the papillary muscles to four concentrations of either isoflurane (4.0%, 2.0%, 1.0%, 0.5%) or halothane (2.0%, 1.0%, 0.5%, 0.25%). Repeat measurements of dt and dF/dt were recorded after 20 min at each concentration. Isoflurane and halothane both caused dose-dependent depression of dt and dF/dt, but at 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%, halothane was significantly more depressant than isoflurane (P less than 0.01 for dt and dF/dt). Quadratic equations were fitted to the dose-response data by least squares analysis (R2 greater than .985 for both anesthetics), and the isoflurane and halothane concentrations that decreased dt to 90%, 70%, 50%, and 30% of control were determined to compare the relative myocardial depressant potency of isoflurane and halothane by linear regression analysis. This potency relationship is described by the equation: isoflurane concentration = -0.005 + 1.445 (halothane concentration). In experiment 2 papillary muscle responses at two similar cardiodepressant concentrations of isoflurane (1.25% and 2.0%) or halothane (0.80% and 1.35%) were compared at stimulus frequencies of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz.

  ".W": "The present experiments were designed to study the cellular mechanism responsible for the depressant effects of halothane and isoflurane on human atrial tissues obtained at cardiac surgery. The fibers were superfused in Tyrode's solution, and transmembrane potentials were recorded with a microelectrode technique. In atrial fibers showing fast response action potential (maximum velocity of depolarization [Vmax] greater than 100 V/s), halothane (0.75 vol%, 0.44 mM) and isoflurane (1.25 vol%, 0.53 mM) decreased slightly the upstroke velocity but depressed the plateau and twitch force significantly. In atrial fibers showing slow rate of phase-0 depolarization or when atrial fibers were depolarized in high [K]0, both halothane and isoflurane decreased the upstroke of slow response and the force. The depressant effects of anesthetics partially mimicked the actions of 1 microM tetrodotoxin and diltiazem and could be reversed by epinephrine or high [Ca]0. The delayed afterdepolarizations or aftercontractions and contracture induced by epinephrine or strophanthidin were also inhibited by both anesthetics. Halothane and isoflurane may depress normal electromechanical activity and arrhythmogenic triggered activity through a reduction of cation fluxes across the cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the clearance of fentanyl in neonates varies with age, the authors determined the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl in 14 humans ages 1-71 days and 15 lambs ages 3-37 days. In humans, fentanyl, 54.1 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SD) micrograms/kg, was administered as a 2-min iv infusion; in lambs, fentanyl, 50 micrograms/kg, was administered as an iv bolus. Ventilation was controlled to maintain end-tidal or arterial PCO2 normal, and potent inhaled anesthetics were not administered; in humans, additional anesthesia was provided with iv morphine. Arterial or venous samples were obtained for 12 h, and plasma concentrations of fentanyl were determined by radioimmunoassay. Plasma concentration versus time data were fitted to two- and three-compartment pharmacokinetic models, and clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss), and elimination half-life were determined. Clearance increased with age in both humans and lambs. Two humans who had intraabdominal surgery had no clearance of fentanyl: plasma concentrations of fentanyl remained constant for approximately 10 h after an initial distribution phase. In lambs, but not in humans, Vdss increased with age; elimination half-life did not change with age in either lambs or humans. The authors conclude that at least two factors--postnatal age and the type of surgery--affect fentanyl clearance during the neonatal period. The effect of other factors, such as inhaled anesthetics, remains to be determined.\r"

None of the five drugs affected pulmonary resistance when the airway was unstimulated. Enflurane and isoflurane significantly attenuated the increase in pulmonary resistance induced by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves. This effect was dose-dependent and similar for both anesthetics at equivalent multiples of their minimum alveolar concentration. Atracurium significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced the increase in pulmonary resistance induced by vagus nerve stimulation; vecuronium had no significant effect. Pancuronium, up to a cumulative dose of 0.14 mg/kg, also significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced the increase in pulmonary resistance induced by vagus nerve stimulation; but this effect was reversed by further increasing the dose. Pancuronium also attenuated the cardiodecelerator response to vagus nerve stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. The underlying mechanisms for the attenuation of responses to vagus nerve stimulation by enflurane or isoflurane or for the increase in response with atracurium are unknown. Pancuronium at lower doses increases the response most likely by blocking prejunctional muscarinic receptors (M2) that physiologically inhibit vagally mediated increases in pulmonary resistance.\r"

Because the mechanism of the resistance is unknown, the authors have sought to establish thermally injured rats as a suitable model for subsequent detailed studies of mechanisms. Two hundred twenty-five- to 250-g rats sustained a 30% total body surface area thermal injury while anesthetized with pentobarbital. Another group had sham injury. Animal activity was monitored both by periods of direct observation and by use of activity cages. At 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 90 days after injury, rats were anesthetized and ventilated and the strength of contraction of their gastrocnemius produced by supramaximal stimulation of the sciatic nerve was measured before and after a bolus of atracurium (2.0 mg/kg) was administered. The plasma concentration required to diminish contraction to 50% of the preceding value (Cp50) was determined by atracurium infusion. Animals displayed the greatest resistance to atracurium at 40 days. The Cp50 value was also greatest at this time. The protein binding of atracurium was identical for both sham and injured groups. Activity for thermally injured resistant rats and for sham animals was not different. It appears that pharmacodynamic mechanisms are involved, and inactivity and disuse atrophy are not necessary in rats for development of resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants after thermal injury.\r"

The hippocampus was dissected from a rat brain and sliced perpendicular to its long axis such that its main neuronal circuits remain functional. A pathway in the slice was stimulated electrically, and an extracellular potential, the evoked population spike, recorded from the neurons postsynaptic to that pathway. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in either the perforant path or the Schaeffer collaterals and a monopolar metal microelectrode placed, respectively, in either the dentate granule cell layer or the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. The slices were maintained in vitro by superfusing them with oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). In order to generate anoxia, the tissue was superfused with aCSF bubbled with 95% N2, 5% CO2 for either 5 or 10 min. All drugs examined were present in the aCSF before, during, and immediately after the anoxic period. Percentage recovery was expressed as the amplitude of the evoked population spike 60 min after anoxia divided by its preanoxic amplitude. Protection in this model is defined as a significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in percentage recovery compared with the recovery of untreated slices. There was no recovery of the response recorded from untreated dentate granule cells after 10 min of anoxia (0 +/- 0%, n = 5; mean +/- SE), whereas 5 min of anoxia was sufficient to cause damage to the untreated CA1 pyramidal cells (4 +/- 3%, n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine in whole brain were 26% and 13% higher (P less than 0.001), respectively, in HI mice than in LO mice. Whole-brain levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, a major metabolite of dopamine, were the same for both HI and LO groups of mice. The authors then analyzed portions of the HI and LO mice brains for concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine. A significant correlation was found between norepinephrine content in the medulla and nitrous oxide requirement. In other regions of the brain (cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, pons, midbrain, hypothalamus), no significant differences in norepinephrine or dopamine levels could be detected. Differences in anesthetic requirements between resistant and susceptible mice decrease from 0.99 to 0.53 atm as they aged from 100 days to 600 days old, paralleling the decline in differences in norepinephrine levels in medulla oblongata between HI and LO mice from 1.6 to 0.73 ng/mg protein. Thus, the difference in anesthetic requirement between HI and LO mice may arise from alterations in catecholamine content in specific regions of the brain.\r"

The prevalence of this anatomic variant, steal-prone coronary anatomy, was investigated in 16,249 patients with coronary artery disease whose angiograms were carefully recorded as part of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS). Almost half of the angiograms had one or more total occlusions, and, of these, about 80% had angiographically visible collateral supply to the area distal to the occlusion. Of subjects with an occlusion and collaterals, about 60% had a hemodynamically significant stenosis of the artery supplying the collateral vessels. In summary, 23% of the patients in the CASS Registry demonstrated steal-prone coronary anatomy. Thus, coronary steal could possibly affect almost a quarter of the patients with coronary artery disease having anesthesia. Studies that seek clinical evidence of harm from coronary steal must be done in that subset of patients with coronary artery disease with steal-prone anatomy.\r"

Fifteen experiments were performed in six chronically instrumented pregnant ewes near term. Each animal received esmolol iv, 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, for 4 min and then 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 6 min. Maternal and fetal blood esmolol concentrations (mean +/- SEM) were 1.2 +/- 0.28 and 0.1 +/- 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively, at the completion of the infusion, and 0.03 +/- 0.01 microgram/ml in the mother and not detectable in the fetus 10 min after stopping the infusion. Despite the relatively low blood esmolol concentration in the fetus compared to the mother, the hemodynamic effects in the fetus were similar to those in the mother. The maximal decrease of maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were 7 +/- 2 and 14 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM), respectively (P less than .05). The maximal decrease of fetal MAP and HR were 7 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 3%, respectively (P less than .05). No changes were seen in maternal or fetal acid-base variables, and intra-amniotic pressure was not affected. The authors conclude that esmolol has a rapid but relatively small transplacental passage, and it is eliminated rapidly from both maternal and fetal plasma.\r"

Isoflurane (1.65-4.45%) reduced the action potential duration at 20% and 90% repolarization times. When step depolarizations were applied under voltage-clamp conditions, there was a depression by isoflurane both of the second inward (calcium) current and of the contraction (measured by an optical method). Isoflurane also depressed \"tail\" currents, which were recorded on repolarization following a voltage-clamp step to 0 mV and which are thought to be activated by cytosolic calcium. Additional actions of isoflurane were investigated using a paired-pulse protocol. The observations were consistent with a reduction by isoflurane of calcium release. This action together with the reduction of calcium influx during the second inward current would contribute to the negative inotropic effect of isoflurane.\r"

After 78 weeks of exposure, mice were left untreated for 3 weeks and were then killed. Mice killed at this time when they were 86 weeks of age, and those killed or dying at other times during the study were subjected to complete gross and microscopic examination. Throughout most of the study, mean body weights of mice exposed to 0.1% isoflurane and 0.4% isoflurane were less by 1-5% and 5-8%, respectively, than that of mice exposed to air alone. Otherwise, no gross toxic treatment effects were noted. The first neoplastic lesion was detected 23 weeks after starting treatment and, by the end of the study, 190 tumors had been detected in 179 mice. However, there were no statistical differences among the groups in the number of mice with a particular tumor at a specific site, the ratio of benign to malignant tumors, or the time to tumor appearance. It was concluded that isoflurane is unlikely to have carcinogenic potential and is a remarkably non-toxic anesthetic in mice.\r"

There are various mechanisms during hemorrhagic shock that can lead to an increase in the oxygen free radicals, which would produce a loss of membrane integrity and a decrease in cardiac function and cardiac contractility. The authors studied the effect of acute hemorrhage and reperfusion on the hemodynamics, blood lactate, and oxygen free radicals. Dogs were divided into two groups, group I, hemorrhagic shock and reinfusion; group II, hemorrhagic shock and reinfusion with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase treatment. The dogs were bled (50% of the estimated blood volume) over a period of five to twelve minutes. After an hour of bleeding, the shed blood was transfused over twenty to twenty-five minutes. Group II received SOD (0.7 mg/kg, IV) and catalase (0.7 mg/kg, IV) within ten minutes of bleeding. The hemodynamic measurements and collection of blood samples for measurement of oxygen free radicals and lactate were made before hemorrhage and at fifteen, thirty, and sixty minutes of hemorrhage and at fifteen, thirty, and sixty minutes after reperfusion of shed blood. There was a decrease in the cardiac function and index of myocardial contractility associated with an increase in the blood lactate after hemorrhage in group I. Similar but less marked changes in these parameters were observed in group II. Recovery of hemodynamic parameters with reinfusion was better in group II as compared with that in group I. There was an increase in blood oxygen free radicals (superoxide anions) in group I, especially after reinfusion. No such changes were observed in group II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The probe is operated in the near field (distance within one wave length of an electromagnetic field source) of a coil, which induces eddy current in a biological tissue. The induced eddy current is converged maximally at the tip of the probe upon contact of the tip with the tissue. The probe produces very high temperatures depending on the wattage selected. In this study, the EFFP was used to evaporate atheromatous plaques in human cadaver abdominal aorta specimens, which were then studied histologically. Gas produced by this technique was analyzed and the volume found to be related to power delivered, but in such small amounts as to be of no embolic significance. While temperature varied with wattage and time of application, it was maximal at the probe tip and easily controlled, resulting in clean obliteration of plaque.\r"

They conclude that, while most Greenfield filters respond to a magnetic field, the chance of migration of a filter because of an MRI scan is small. Therefore, MRI scanning of patients with Greenfield filters has little risk.\r"

Verapamil did not exert any unfavorable metabolic or hematologic effects over the years. HDL-cholesterol was moderately increased (mean 24%) and the other plasma lipids were unaffected. These data suggest that the calcium channel blocker verapamil is a metabolically safe drug to use as monotherapy in essential hypertension.\r"

The mass was a violaceous, protuberant, compressible tumor covered with distended peau d'orange skin. A pressure dressing was applied to the lesion, and it was made certain that the blood supply to the foot was not cut off. The lesion began to resolve within a week and over the next few months; however, pressure may need to be continued for her lifetime. The patient had been wearing a pressure-gradient leotard as of six months of age, but this was discontinued after two weeks because of the authors' inability to converse with the child to determine how much pressure could be safely employed. This is one example of a to date successfully treated hemolymphangioma in a neonate using a pressure dressing initially followed by combined compression therapy. The proposed mechanism of this therapy, as well as comparison with other types of therapy, is discussed.\r"

This complication resulted in the death of 2; in the remaining 3, it was controlled by electrical cardiac pacing or intravenous atropine. In 3 patients, the strokes were due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, and in 2, they were secondary to vascular occlusion. In at least 4 patients, the prognosis seemed favorable from a neurologic standpoint. Vagally mediated sinus node arrest may, therefore, represent a potentially fatal complication of strokes and may be more frequent than currently appreciated. Continuous monitoring in the early phase of acute strokes and pacemaker therapy may be lifesaving in some patients. This and the general phenomenon of functional failure of the sinus node due to a variety of causes are discussed.\r"

The return pathway into the right pulmonary artery was most unusual. The embryologic explanation of the anomaly and the surgical implications are discussed. The return pathway of the left-to-right shunt by a branch of the pulmonary artery is most unusual and has hitherto not been reported in English literature to the best of the authors' knowledge.\r"

The VC, FEV1 and viscous work of breathing time-response curves were almost identical, indicating bronchodilation. We conclude that in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the powder inhalation was not more effective than the pressurized aerosol. It could, however, be offered as an alternative to patients with poor hand-lung coordination. The patients tolerated the two modes of administration without difficulties: no local irritation or coughing was observed.\r"

All received yellow jacket venom immunotherapy and four honeybee venom immunotherapy. In four patients, the reactions occurred following small venom doses, 0.1 to 2 micrograms. Two patients reacted after maintenance doses of 50 micrograms. There was no relationship to the serum IgE or IgG antibody titers. All but one patient had serum venom-specific IgE but the titers covered a wide range. Serum venom-specific IgG was present in four patients. There was no response in lymphocyte culture to bee venom stimulation in two patients. Two of these patients stopped venom immunotherapy; one had reached the maintenance dose. In three patients, prophylactic parenteral steroids have ameliorated the reactions. After a temporary dose reduction, the sixth patient is now asymptomatic. A seventh patient developed asthma, 12 hours following a maintenance dose of 50 micrograms of yellow jacket venom. Concomitant steroid administration has effectively prevented the reaction. Another patient, a 6-year-old boy, developed fever, edema of the face and lips, erythema of the leg, and a large, tender right inguinal node eight hours following venom skin tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The crude aqueous extracts of birch (Betula verrucosa) and hazel (Corylus avellana) pollen were characterized by horizontal isoelectric focusing (IEF) and one-dimensional and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1-D and 2-D SDS/PAGE). Isoelectric focusing reference patterns obtained in pH 3.5 to 9.5 gradient gels contained 31 and 41 bands while the 2-D patterns consisted of 51 and 72 protein spots, respectively. Electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and subsequent 125I-immunoautoradiography demonstrated IgE binding in the region between pH 4.8 and 5.4 for both extracts. The main allergenic reactivities of this pH region were distributed by SDS/PAGE to the molecular weights of 29.5, 17, and 12.5 kilodaltons for birch and 15.5 and 12 kilodaltons for hazel. The high resolving power and the independence of rabbit antibodies were considered the major advantages of the described 2-D methodology as compared with conventional crossed immunoelectrophoretic and radioimmunoelectrophoretic techniques.\r"

However, most aspects of this problem remain unstudied because no organization or government agency tracks such data and no regulatory or administrative guidelines adequately address its management. We surveyed 170 US teaching hospital ED medical directors with respect to violence and security issues and received responses from 127 (74.7%). Among other findings, 41 institutions report at least one verbal threat each day, and 23 report at least one threat with a weapon each month. Four-point physical restraint is used by 125 of the 127 facilities. Personnel in 32 of these facilities restrain at least one patient each day. Seventeen institutions report having significantly injured a patient during restraint in the last five years, resulting in one death. Twenty institutions report involvement with litigation with respect to restraint. Only 51 institutions provide ED nurses with formal training in recognition and management of aggression and violence, and only 79 institutions have security personnel present in the ED 24 hours a day. A sizable number of facilities receiving frequent threats and batteries are not among those with 24-hour-a-day security personnel. A preventative, risk-management approach that addresses environmental factors, training policies, restraint, security arrangements, and legal precedents is suggested.\r"

Cardiac failure and abnormal growth may result from the shunted blood flow. With the advancement of angiography, more defined study of the arteriovenous anomaly can be identified and a reduction of risk during treatment can be promised. Three cases of extensive arteriovenous malformations are presented. Each has been successfully treated by combining radiologic microembolization followed by surgical extirpation of the vascular mass, without complication.\r"

Diagnosis was based on both a 20 mmHg difference in blood pressure between arms and reversed blood flow in the vertebral artery. Twenty-one patients (25.6%) had a transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident before the study. In 16 patients (19.5%), the anterior circulation was involved and the vertebrobasilar circulation was effected in 5 patients (4.8%). Fifty-five patients were followed for one to six years (mean 4.1 years). During this period three patients died. Noninvasive studies showed that 39 patients (70.9%) had progression of disease in the carotid arteries and that 10 of these 39 (12.1%) exhibited a transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident, and eight patients (9.7%) required carotid endarterectomy. No patient had a stroke involving the vertebrobasilar circulation, but four patients (4.8%) had a transient ischemic attack. Three other patients had revascularization procedures performed for arm ischemia. Patients with subclavian steal syndrome are more likely to experience a transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident involving the carotid circulation than the vertebrobasilar circulation. Noninvasive evaluation of the carotid arteries and the posterior circulation should be included in the long-term follow-up of these patients.\r"

No cases are included unless a minimum of three years since surgery has elapsed. The unselected recurrence rate is 2.77 per cent. All ten recurrences are studied and related to changes in surgical technique.

The hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels of 14 successful and 6 failed free flaps at the time of operation, during hospitalization, and at discharge are reviewed. There was no difference in Hb or Hct levels between successful and failed flaps. Reconstruction of traumatic defects showed an increased risk of failure. If flaps survived longer than 10-14 days, they were unlikely to fail subsequently. In conclusion, Hb and Hct levels in clinically acceptable ranges have no effect on free flap survival.\r"

Due to these endoscopic findings, 29 patients (44% of positive findings or 10% of all pre-operative evaluations) had an alteration of planned treatment. The indications for preoperative endoscopy in these patients were: atypical symptoms of diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease, symptoms of GI tract disease unrelated to an elective surgical procedure, history of prior GI tract disease which may complicate elective surgery, and evaluation of a portion of the GI tract prior to operating on that segment. Judicious use of preoperative endoscopy following the above guidelines can decrease adverse surgical outcomes.\r"

One hundred and fifty patients who underwent various abdominal operations with a Levine tube served as a control group (retrospective group). The tubeless study group (prospective group) of 150 patients was randomly and blindly divided into three equal subgroups. Subgroup A patients were operated on without any NG tube. The tube in subgroup B patients was inserted after induction of anesthesia and removed one hour after the operation. The tube in subgroup C was inserted as in subgroup B, but was taken out 12 hours after the operation. The total number of complications in the intubated group was significantly higher than in the tubeless group (P less than 0.01). High temperature, atelectasis and miscellaneous complications were more frequent in the control group than in the study group (P less than 0.01). Other complications such as nausea, vomiting, bronchopneumonia, and gastric dilatation, as well as the resolution of the postoperative ileus and hospital stay, were not of statistical significance. Fewer miscellaneous complications (P less than 0.05) and less patient discomfort were found in subgroup A than in the other tubeless subgroups. Complications in the study group were easily controlled by conservative treatment and no serious complications resulted. Therefore, the routine use of NG suction as adjunctive therapy following abdominal operations is not advocated by this study.\r"

The clinical significance of this distinction is pertinent to the control of the hemorrhage in the field as well as in the operating room. To test the hypothesis the femoral arterial blood flow (Q) of seven anesthetized (pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg, IV) dogs, whose average weight was 19.5 +/- 0.9 kg, was measured before and after partial (25%, 75%) and complete transection of the artery distal to the transducer of an electromagnetic blood flow meter amplifier. Systemic arterial pressure (P) was recorded. Control Q was 72 +/- 14 (S.E.) ml/min, control P was 119 +/- 9 mmHg. Flow increased to 369 +/- 24 ml/min when partial laceration (25% lumenal diameter) was accomplished sharply; this increase was significant (P = 1.7 X 10(-6]. When the arterial division was near completion (75% lumenal transection), Q was 358 +/- 30 ml/min. This value was not significantly different (P = 0.80) from the value that resulted from complete transection of the femoral artery (320 +/- 41 ml/min). Arterial pressure fell transiently (11.5 +/- 1.7, 13.5 +/- 1.6, and 13.9 +/- 2.1 mmHg respectively) as a result of each injury but the apparent differences were not significant (P = 0.25). These observations from canine experimentation indicate that hemorrhage from the partially severed femoral artery is indistinguishable from that which results from its complete transection. In view of these findings in dogs, traditional concepts regarding such injuries in man should be viewed as unproven speculation.\r"

I also compared this group of patients with 105 patients who received do-not-resuscitate status with family consent over 3 months in 1986. Socioeconomic factors were similar between cases and controls. Selected prehospitalization characteristics such as history of alcohol or substance abuse, depression, dementia, or other psychiatric diseases were rarely present in the ethics committee group. However, these patients were likely to be incontinent (90%), incapable of any self-care (80%), and have low Glasgow Coma Scale scores (mean, 9.4). The ethics committee cases were relatively young (mean 63.6 years), were in the hospital for a long period before a do-not-resuscitate decision was reached (mean, 48.2 days), were frequently admitted to intensive care units (75%), and often received ventilatory (70%) and pressor medication (50%) support. Eighty percent of the ethics committee cases died in the hospital. The control do-not-resuscitate patients were much less sick and received much less invasive support. This research suggests that the ethics committee at the study hospital was not redefining the principles of medical ethics that underlie decisions not to resuscitate when it recommended limited care in the absence of family consent, but rather was recommending such limitations only for patients in whom it appeared further care was futile.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of cyclosporin A in patients with severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Prospective randomized, double-blind 6-month trial. PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients who had classic seropositive rheumatoid arthritis with active synovitis unresponsive to conventional therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to high-dose (10 mg/kg body weight.d) or low-dose (1 mg/kg.d) cyclosporin A therapy. A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97). CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Side effects, particularly nephrotoxicity, are common.\r"

SETTING: Referral-based bone clinic at a large teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 35 asymptomatic relatives, aged 19 to 59 years, of patients with osteoporotic fractures, and 24 patients with osteoporotic fractures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bone mineral density in the spine was measured by quantitative computed tomographic scanning. Bone mineral content in the os calcis was measured in 19 of the relatives of osteoporotic patients by single-photon absorptiometry. The values for bone mineral density in the spine were corrected to age 50 years with the regression equation derived from the normal values in the controls. The values were lower in relatives of osteoporotic patients than in controls. In men, the mean values (+/- standard deviation [SD]) for relatives were 91 +/- 16 mg/cm3, and for controls, 129 +/- 21 mg/cm3 (P less than 0.001). In women, the mean values for relatives were 96 +/- 17 mg/cm3 and for controls, 126 +/- 19 mg/cm3 (P less than 0.001). In the osteoporotic patients, the corrected mean value for men was 53 +/- 12 mg/cm3, and for women, 77 +/- 20 mg/cm3. The os calcis values did not correlate with the spine values and were mostly well within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Mean bone mass is lower in apparently healthy young and middle-aged adult relatives of osteoporotic patients than in normal persons with no family history of osteoporosis. Our findings suggest that the failure to attain an adequate peak bone mass may play an important role in the later development of osteoporotic fractures. Relatives of osteoporotic patients should be advised to have measurements of bone mass taken. This measurement should be taken at the spine, because peripheral sites do not appear to provide adequate information about early osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of small polyps in the rectosigmoid in an asymptomatic group and the likelihood of finding synchronous neoplastic polyps proximally at colonoscopy. DESIGN: Asymptomatic patients with polyps 9 mm or less found at screening fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy were referred for colonoscopy, at which time all polyps were removed. SETTING: Screening fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy unit. PATIENTS: Referral from Executive Health Wellness Clinic and large multispeciality clinic. RESULTS: From 3923 sigmoidoscopic examinations, 258 asymptomatic subjects (7%) were identified who had polyps 9 mm or smaller. One hundred and eighty-nine patients (73%) had colonoscopy. In 179 patients, the target lesion noted at sigmoidoscopy was identified at colonoscopy. Based on histology of the target lesion, patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 (72 patients) had only hyperplastic polyps; Group 2 (69 patients) had at least one neoplastic polyp; and Group 3 (31 patients) had polyps with normal histology. Seven patients were not classified. Neoplastic polyps were found proximally in 21 patients in Group 1 (29%; 95% CI, 19 to 39), 23 patients in Group 2 (33%; 95% CI, 22 to 44), and 4 patients in Group 3 (13%; 95% CI, 4 to 30). There was no difference in mean age between groups. The results were similar when only polyps 5 mm or smaller were analyzed. CONCLUSION: Because small polyps of any histologic type in the rectosigmoid indicate a high risk for having neoplastic polyps proximally, the guidelines of both the American College of Physicians and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy may need to be revised. Colonoscopy seems justified in any patient in whom a small polyp is discovered at sigmoidoscopy.\r"

  ".W": "Patients request health care for reasons that transcend the management of medical disease. Patients seek to create an \"alliance\" with the physician which \"compensates\" for conflict or deficit in the family system. This is particularly true for \"problem,\" \"difficult,\" or \"hateful\" patients who have significant psychosocial problems. When such a compensatory alliance evolves, it may become dysfunctional, limiting the physician's ability to make necessary medical interventions. By not explicitly including other family members, the traditional dyadic model of the doctor-patient relationship predisposes towards the formation of a compensatory alliance. The nature of the dysfunctional compensatory alliance may even remain obscure because the patient presents a distorted picture of the family situation. Therefore, to manage the compensatory alliance, the physician must perform a simple family assessment, including direct communication with other family members, early in the formation of the doctor-patient relationship. The physician should be alert to the formation of a dysfunctional compensatory alliance and the need to perform a family assessment whenever a patient explicitly or implicitly makes a request that engages the doctor with another family member. Recognition that a patient is \"difficult\" or awareness of a sense of helplessness, and frustration in caring for a patient may also indicate formation of a dysfunctional compensatory alliance and the need for family assessment. Recognizing key aspects of the doctor-patient-family relationship will enable the clinician to manage the compensatory alliance in a productive and therapeutic fashion. When family dysfunction requiring significant change is discovered, involvement of a family therapist should be offered.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite available criteria, diagnosis of the mechanisms of wide complex tachycardia is often incorrect. We aimed in this study to identify reasons for misdiagnoses and the value and limitations of clinical and surface electrocardiographic criteria. DATA IDENTIFICATION: The analyzed data of 150 consecutive patients with wide QRS tachycardia from this study and a literature search of key papers in English since 1960 on clinical and surface electrocardiographic criteria form the basis of this report. The final correct diagnosis was made with intracardiac electrograms. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Among the 150 patients, 122 had ventricular tachycardia, 21 had supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction, and 7 had accessory pathway conduction. Only 39 of 122 patients with ventricular tachycardia were correctly diagnosed initially. In others, the diagnoses were supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction (43 of 122) or simply a wide QRS tachycardia (40 of 122). Misdiagnosis in patients with aberrant or accessory pathway conduction was also common. Standard electrocardiographic criteria for ventricular tachycardia had unacceptable sensitivity, poor specificity, or both. Collectively such criteria allowed a correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia in 92% of cases. Diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia was also suggested by its association with structural heart disease. Criteria suggestive of ventricular tachycardia included atrioventricular dissociation, positive QRS concordance, axis less than -90 deg to +/- 180 deg, combination of left bundle branch block and right axis, QRS duration of greater than 140 ms with right bundle branch block and greater than 160 ms with left bundle branch block and, a different QRS during tachycardia compared to baseline preexisting bundle branch block. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular tachycardia is the commonest underlying mechanism for wide QRS tachycardia. A correct diagnosis can usually be made from clinical and surface electrocardiographic criteria.\r"
