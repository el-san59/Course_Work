This adverse sequela of treatment has been assumed, by some, to represent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (incontinence of melanin pigment), and has been said to occur in individuals with this tendency. Histologic data presented in this paper suggest that this phenomenon does not represent melanocytic alteration, but is secondary to extravasation of red blood cells into the dermis following rupture of fragile vessels with resulting deposition of hemosiderin. Therapy has included bleaching agents (hydroquinones), trichloroacetic acid, and phenolic peeling agents with variable success. Eighty percent of patients who experience this adverse sequela will clear spontaneously within 6-24 months. The remaining patients will have persistence of pigmentation for up to 5 years, with a small number of patients having pigmentation persisting 5 years after therapy.\r"

To determine whether similar changes in magnitude and distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy may also occur in adult patients with this disease, serial assessment of left ventricular wall thickness was obtained with M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography in 65 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were 23 to 50 years of age. The follow-up period was 3 to 6 years (mean 4). None of the 65 patients showed a substantial increase (greater than or equal to 5 mm) in left ventricular wall thickness; however, 9 (14%) demonstrated a substantial decrease (5 to 9 mm). Wall thinning most commonly involved the anterior ventricular septum (seven patients), but was also identified in the posterior septum (six patients), lateral free wall (two patients) and posterior free wall (one patient). In the nine patients with wall thinning, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter increased significantly (from 44 +/- 6 to 51 +/- 6 mm; p less than 0.001); however, in seven of the nine, absolute cavity size remained within normal limits (less than or equal to 52 mm) at the most recent evaluation. Eight of the nine patients with left ventricular wall thinning and relative cavity enlargement were severely symptomatic and one was mildly symptomatic. In conclusion, substantial progression of left ventricular hypertrophy was not identified in any of the study patients. Hence, if such progression occurs in adults with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it is probably rare. Conversely, an important minority of adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may show progressive left ventricular wall thinning and relative cavity enlargement, which are usually associated with severe cardiac symptoms.\r"

To define factors that may influence the occurrence of syncope in children taking quinidine, the clinical, anatomic, electrocardiographic, roentgenographic and pharmacologic data were compared in six patients with syncope (Group A) and 22 patients without syncope (Group B). There was a significant (chi-square = 10.2, p = 0.001) relation between heart disease and quinidine syncope: all six Group A (syncopal) patients had heart disease whereas 15 of the 22 Group B (non-syncopal) patients had no structural heart disease. In contrast, no significant difference was noted between Group A and Group B patients in mean age (11.4 versus 11.4 years), mean quinidine serum concentration (2.9 versus 2.3 micrograms/ml), mean corrected QT interval before quinidine (0.43 versus 0.40 second) or mean corrected QT interval during quinidine therapy (0.46 versus 0.46 second) or between those taking digitalis and those not. Two of the six Group A (syncopal) patients died during therapy, one 6 days after initiating therapy and one suddenly at home 6 months after beginning quinidine. Another two of the six Group A patients exhibited hypokalemia (both 2.9 mEq/liter) at the time of syncope, 2 weeks and 6 months, respectively, after initiation of quinidine therapy; both survived. Syncope occurred within 8 days of initiation of quinidine therapy in three of the six patients. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was observed during quinidine associated arrhythmia in three of six patients with syncope; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular ectopic activity while on this therapy was observed before syncope in the other three patients in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, this conceptual evolution has been uneven and has littered practical interpretation with diagnostic criteria that depend on assumptions of uneven validity. The good news is that some of the criteria are surprisingly helpful and that the shattering and reassembling of the conceptual framework relating the heart to the electrocardiogram may facilitate the construction of a more comprehensive and effective diagnostic approach.\r"

Thrombus was induced by apical infarction and injection of a sclerosing agent and thrombin. The animals were classified into four groups according to the time of indium-111 platelet injection after thrombus induction: Group I (17 dogs, 1/2 hour after induction; 3 dogs, before induction), Group II (12 dogs, 24 hours after induction) and Group III (12 dogs, 1 week after induction). In Group IV (six control dogs) apical infarction was produced, but thrombin was not injected; indium-111 platelets were injected 1/2 to 1 hour after infarction. The dogs were studied by indium-111 platelet scintigraphy and by two-dimensional echocardiography 1/2 to 5 hours (Group I) and 1 to 5 and up to 72 hours (Groups II to IV) after platelet administration and before death was induced. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed the best overall sensitivity for detection of acute thrombus (97%; 29 of 30). The sensitivity of indium-111 platelet scintigraphy was 86% (18 of 21) for clots greater than or equal to 0.08 ml in size, and 67% (20 of 30) for detection of all clots. Thrombus did not form in 14 dogs of Groups I to III and in 6 of 6 control dogs. The specificity of scintigraphy was 100% (20 of 20) compared with 80% (16 of 20) for echocardiography.

Infarct size was equivalent when assessed by planimetry of ventricular slices before and after staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride.

Seven of 11 control dogs survived (p = NS); 75 +/- 4% of the risk region was infarcted in the control animals (p less than 0.01 versus treated survivors). Light microscopic inspection of specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosin confirmed the border between necrotic and preserved myocardium. Thrombus was observed in the coronary sinus in all survivors in the treatment group. These findings confirm earlier short-term studies that demonstrated a potent anti-ischemic effect of intermittent coronary sinus occlusion. At the same time, coronary sinus thrombosis warrants caution in the application of this technique to myocardial ischemia in humans.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effect of the perfluorochemical, Fluosol DA 20%, on infarct size, infarct morphology, ventricular ectopic activity and serial regional ventricular function in a 2 week closed chest canine model. After 90 minutes of proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion, animals randomly received either oxygenated Fluosol DA (n = 9) or saline solution (n = 9) intracoronary at 15 ml/kg body weight over 20 to 30 minutes. Hemodynamic variables were similar in the two groups except for transient elevation of left ventricular filling pressure immediately after infusion in the treated group. Infarct size was markedly reduced in the perfluorochemical-treated animals when expressed as a percent of the risk region (10.8 +/- 1.8% versus 28.9 +/- 5.5%, p less than 0.02) or as a percent of the total left ventricle (3.7 +/- 1% versus 10.8 +/- 8%, p less than 0.006). This was associated with greater improvement in radial shortening in the jeopardized zone at 2 weeks after reperfusion (15.3 +/- 2.8% versus 5.2 +/- 2.1%, p less than 0.01). Histologic examination revealed adequate healing in the treated animals with an increased number of swollen mononuclear cells in the border zones. Holter electrocardiographic recordings demonstrated a low frequency of ventricular ectopic beats in both groups. This study suggests that the perfluorochemical, Fluosol DA, may be a potentially useful agent in enhancing myocardial salvage after successful reperfusion.\r"

The center lumen of the intracoronary balloon catheter was used for sequential injections of 1 ml (meglumine diatrizoate) Renografin-76, and contrast washout rate was determined by videodensitometry in myocardial regions subserved by the left anterior descending coronary artery. Before coronary artery occlusion, washout rate was 22.4 +/- 2.7 min-1 (mean +/- SEM). Five minutes after occlusion, and immediately before synchronized retroperfusion, washout rate dropped sharply to 2.0 +/- 0.7 min-1. Twenty-five minutes after occlusion, with 50 ml/min synchronized retroperfusion treatment applied for 5 minutes, washout rate was 5.0 +/- 1.5 min-1. Thus, synchronized retroperfusion significantly (p less than 0.05) accelerated contrast disappearance over that during presynchronized retroperfusion ischemia. To determine the effects of synchronized retroperfusion on retrograde delivery to the ischemic myocardium, monastral blue dye was retroinfused through the system into the great cardiac vein before the dog was killed. Transverse heart slices were then studied by light microscopy, and regional intravascular dye content was scored from 0 to 3 (0 = no dye, 3 = maximal dye). After great cardiac vein synchronized retroperfusion, blue dye content in capillaries of ischemic anterior and nonischemic posterior aspects of the left ventricle was 2.3 +/- 0.5 versus 0.7 +/- 0.3, respectively (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients with cardiomyopathy were directed to perform the exercise at the same intensity after receiving 30 to 60 mg of diltiazem, three times daily, for 1 or 2 weeks.

To assess left ventricular diastolic behavior, the following variables were analyzed: peak velocity in the rapid filling and atrial contraction phases, the ratio of peak velocity in the atrial contraction phase to that in the rapid filling phase, and pressure half-time. The changes in peak velocity in the atrial contraction phase, pressure half-time and the ratio of peak velocity in the atrial contraction phase to that in the rapid filling phase with exercise differed significantly between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with no medication and control subjects. After diltiazem, the response of these variables to exercise was almost identical in the two groups. These results suggest that diltiazem can lessen the left ventricular diastolic abnormality in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on dynamic exercise of mild intensity.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular relaxation and filling are impaired in many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To investigate the influence of regional heterogeneity on these global abnormalities, 48 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sinus rhythm were studied by radionuclide angiography before and after 1 to 2 weeks of verapamil therapy (320 to 640 mg/day, median 480). Left ventricular regional function was assessed by subdividing the ventricular region of interest into 20 sectors and into four quadrants from which regional time-activity curves were derived. Diastolic asynchrony was measured as the regional variation in timing between minimal volume and peak filling rate, and heterogeneity in the magnitude of rapid diastolic filling was measured as the regional variation in percent contribution of atrial systole to end-diastolic volume. Compared with 28 normal subjects, the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had greater regional variation in both timing (35 +/- 24 versus 12 +/- 6 ms, p less than 0.001) and magnitude (10 +/- 6 versus 7 +/- 4%, p less than 0.02) of rapid filling. Verapamil reduced the regional variation in timing (to 21 +/- 16 ms, p less than 0.001) and magnitude (to 7 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) of rapid filling. These regional changes, indicating more uniform regional diastolic performance after verapamil, were associated with improved global diastolic filling: global rapid filling increased in both rate and magnitude and time to peak filling rate decreased. These findings indicate that the beneficial effect of verapamil on left ventricular diastolic function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be mediated by reduction in regional asynchrony.\r"

Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were constructed using high fidelity left ventricular pressure measured with micromanometer-tipped catheters and simultaneous left ventricular volume obtained by gated blood pool imaging. Afterload was reduced with the vasodilator nitroprusside to generate the baseline left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation, a relatively load-independent measure of contractile function. The intravenous administration of enoximone (mean dose 75 mg) shifted the end-systolic pressure-volume point upward and leftward from the baseline pressure-volume relation in eight of the nine patients, demonstrating a positive inotropic effect of this agent. The maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development (peak positive dP/dt) increased from 1,030 +/- 142 to 1,381 +/- 219 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.01) on enoximone despite a significant decrease in preload (as assessed by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume) and a small, insignificant decrease in mean arterial pressure. Two patients developed angina after enoximone administration; both patients had coronary artery disease and experienced a greater than 30% increase in heart rate-systolic blood pressure product. Thus, enoximone has a significant inotropic effect in patients with severe heart failure. Like other inotropic drugs, it has the potential to increase myocardial oxygen demand and thereby precipitate ischemia.\r"

After incremental intravenous dosing (mean total dose 1.8 +/- 0.4 mg/kg body weight), cardiac index increased (1.7 +/- 0.3 to 2.6 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.001) and left ventricular filling pressure decreased (25 +/- 7 to 19 +/- 7 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Also decreasing significantly were right atrial pressure (13 +/- 6 to 7 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.005) and systemic vascular resistance (1,633 +/- 394 to 1,183 +/- 278 dynes.s.cm-5; p less than 0.001). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure did not change, whereas stroke work index increased significantly (13.3 +/- 4.3 to 21.6 +/- 7.3 g.m/m2; p less than 0.005). The increase in stroke work index with a concomitant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure indicates an improvement in systolic performance after treatment with piroximone. Similar responses were obtained after incremental doses of piroximone in oral solution. After oral doses of piroximone tablets, cardiac index also increased significantly (2.1 +/- 0.6 to 2.4 +/- 0.5 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.05), although this magnitude of increase was comparatively low. In a subgroup of 10 patients who underwent equilibrium gated radionuclide blood pool scintigraphy before and after intravenous piroximone, end-diastolic volume index tended to increase (106 +/- 42 to 132 +/- 60 ml/m2; p = 0.07), whereas left ventricular filling pressure decreased significantly (26 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 9 mm Hg; p less than 0.01).\r"

Because desmopressin acetate (a synthetic analogue of vasopressin) shortens bleeding time in a variety of platelet disorders, a controlled clinical trial of intravenous desmopressin was performed in 39 patients with excessive mediastinal bleeding (greater than 100 ml/h) and a prolonged template bleeding time (greater than 10 minutes) more than 2 hours after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Twenty-three desmopressin recipients and 16 control patients (no desmopressin) were similar in surgical procedure, pump time, platelet count, template bleeding time and amount of bleeding before therapy (p = NS). Compared with the control group, the patients receiving desmopressin (20 micrograms; mean 0.3 micrograms/kg) utilized fewer blood products (29 +/- 19 versus 15 +/- 13 units/patient; p less than 0.05), especially platelets (12 +/- 9 versus 4 +/- 7 units/patient; p = 0.004), while achieving a similarly effective reduction in mediastinal bleeding (4.8- and 4.3-fold, p = 0.001 for both). Severe platelet dysfunction was partially corrected within 1 hour after desmopressin infusion, during which interval no blood products were administered: the template bleeding time shortened (from 17 to 12.5 minutes, p less than 0.05), whereas the platelet count remained unchanged (at 96 +/- 35 and 105 +/- 31 X 10(3)/mm3, p = NS). The plasma levels of two factor VIII components increased: procoagulant activity (VIII:C) from 0.97 +/- 0.43 to 1.52 +/- 0.74 units/ml (p less than 0.05) and von Willebrand factor (VIII:vWF) from 1.28 to 1.78 units/ml (p less than 0.05); these increases correlated with the shortening of the bleeding time (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma concentrations and the effects of the drug on conduction intervals or right ventricular effective refractory periods were not related to suppression of arrhythmia induction by ventricular stimulation after 1 month of therapy. The relation between amiodarone plasma concentrations and both toxicity and efficacy during long-term therapy were prospectively assessed in a larger series of 114 consecutive patients with either symptomatic supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias who were followed up on long-term amiodarone therapy for 26 +/- 15 months.

However, the combination of abnormally high peak transmitral diastolic flow velocity, with a normal pressure half-time, and increased flow velocity in the tricuspid regurgitant jet compatible with severe pulmonary hypertension, in the absence of other apparent left heart disease, suggested the correct diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation in both cases. Techniques for optimal pulsed Doppler assessment of the mitral anulus region are emphasized, as are the theoretic advantages of continuous wave and color-coded pulsed Doppler echocardiography for detection of periprosthetic regurgitation.\r"

In both patients, the rest electrocardiogram showed apparent sinus bradycardia. Patient 1 had frequent paroxysms of atrial tachycardia with long pauses of up to 10 seconds; Patient 2 had paroxysmal atrial flutter and atrial pauses of up to 8 seconds. Multiple, repetitive, low frequency deflections, with a cycle length ranging from 730 to 960 ms in Case 1 and 570 to 750 ms in Case 2, suggestive of sinus node electrograms, were recorded at a critical area at the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium. These low frequency deflections had no relation to spontaneous junctional beats or the spontaneous atrial beats that showed high frequency deflections on the atrial electrogram. However, they could be suppressed by spontaneous or paced atrial beats. Pharmacologic interventions in Case 2 showed that the cycle length of the low frequency deflections shortened after administration of isoproterenol and did not change after propranolol or atropine. Thus, complete sinoatrial exit block with intact entrance conduction can occur in patients with bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. Under such circumstances, the surface electrocardiographic manifestation of sinus bradycardia may not be of sinus origin.\r"

Infarct artery perfusion was documented at predischarge coronary angiography, and left ventricular volume was measured by nongeometric analysis of radionuclide angiograms performed within 48 hours of infarction and at 1 month. Left ventricular dilation (greater than or equal to 20% increase in volume) developed in 16 patients, whereas 5 patients had a decrease in left ventricular volume of greater than or equal to 20% by 1 month.

Seventeen pollen components (in the molecular weight (MW) range of 8000 to 94,000 daltons), separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, bound IgE antibodies from a panel of 44 sera from allergic patients. The spectrum of Bermuda grass-pollen IgE-binding components detected is greater in number and wider in MW range than has previously been described. A component of MW 34,000 daltons (fraction 9) bound IgE from 100% of atopic sera tested. This component also bound the greatest quantity of IgE. Electrophoresis and transfer under nondissociating conditions revealed a component of MW 100,000 daltons that also bound IgE antibodies in all 44 sera tested. This component may be an aggregated form of fraction 9. A comparison of the electroblotting results obtained under dissociating and nondissociating conditions suggests once again that allergenic proteins in crude extracts may aggregate or associate during in vitro studies. Electrophoretic transfer analysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis may thus be the method of choice for allergen separation and identification.\r"

The onset of symptoms in one case was coincident with a generalized cutaneous reaction to penicillin with laryngeal involvement. The other cases had been misdiagnosed as food allergy and chemical sensitivity. We describe the psychologic factors in these cases in terms of the primary and secondary gain operative in the somatoform disorder of conversion reaction and emphasize the importance of belief and learned sensitivity in the induction of symptoms. The necessity of considering psychologic factors and the use of blinded, controlled, provocation challenges to evaluate subjective symptomatology is underscored. This study emphasizes the heterogenicity of clinical presentations involving vocal cord dysfunction and illustrates the value of fiberoptic-assisted examination of laryngeal function in conjunction with provocation challenge testing in establishing causal relationships for specific clinical symptoms.\r"

The sensitized rabbits reacted to antigenic challenge with PA-protein conjugates intravenously, with increases in respiratory frequency and pulmonary resistance. This animal model may be used for the further elucidation of the mechanism of occupational asthma induced by small molecular weight chemical compounds.\r"

Mean baseline FEV1 was approximately 60% of predicted normal for both groups. Pulmonary function tests and vital signs were measured before and for up to 8 hours after treatments on test days 1, 30, 60, and 90. Mean maximum increases in FEV1 were 51%, 54%, 52%, and 55% for bitolterol versus 48%, 46%, 50%, and 43% for isoproterenol on these monthly test days. The mean FEV1 response remained greater than 15% over zero time (baseline) for greater than or equal to 8 hours after medication with bitolterol on each of four monthly pulmonary function test days and 2 1/2 to 5 hours for isoproterenol. Median durations of bronchodilator activity for bitolterol were 7.3, 6.5, 6.5, and 6.0 hours versus 4.0, 1.7, 3.7, and 1.9 hours for isoproterenol on the monthly test days. On these test days, 37% to 49% of the patients treated with bitolterol had a duration of action of at least 8 hours compared with 16% to 29% after isoproterenol treatment. The onset of activity was within 5 minutes for both drugs. Bitolterol provided superior bronchodilator activity with fewer adverse effects compared with isoproterenol, and there was no evidence for drug tolerance during this 3-month study.\r"

In this study, the change in circulating numbers of band 1 and band 2 basophils, as well as other leukocytes, was measured after a single oral dose of prednisone. Three hours after ingestion of 50 mg of prednisone, the circulating number of band 1 basophils was 19 +/- 4% of the preprednisone value, whereas the band 2 level was 87 +/- 18% (SEM for five subjects). At 6 hours, values were 10 +/- 1% and 41 +/- 7% for band 1 and band 2, respectively. Circulating numbers of both basophil populations returned to near normal at 24 hours. The 3-hour response to a 10 mg oral dose in seven subjects was 28 +/- 5% and 89 +/- 10% of preprednisone levels for band 1 and band 2; the 6-hour responses were 28 +/- 7% and 84 +/- 7%. The 3-hour responses of other leukocytes in four of these subjects, expressed as a percentage of preprednisone counts were neutrophils, 171 +/- 27%; lymphocytes, 47 +/- 6%; monocytes, 36 +/- 9%; and eosinophils, 26 +/- 11%. The results demonstrate that band 2 basophils have a lower sensitivity to glucocorticoid action than do band 1 basophils or other types of circulating leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study seasonal variation in dust-mite allergen, we obtained dust samples from bedding, carpet, and/or sofas in 12 houses in central Virginia, monthly, for 1 year. The houses included those of nine patients with asthma of whom six were allergic to dust mites. Dust samples were assayed with an inhibition radioimmunoassay for mite allergen that detects cross-reacting determinants on Der f and Der p I from Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus, respectively. The results are expressed as micrograms of antigen P1 equivalent (AgP1Eq). The results demonstrate that large seasonal variations in allergen, i.e., more than twentyfold, can occur in dust from all sites and are not restricted to the houses of allergic patients. However, dust from some sites, particularly sofas, remained \"high\" (greater than 10 micrograms AgP1Eq per gram), whereas dust from other sites remained \"low\" (less than 1 microgram AgP1Eq per gram) throughout the year. Levels of mite allergen generally started to rise in July about 1 month after the rise in humidity. In August to December, the mean levels of AgP1Eq in house dust were highly significantly increased relative to April to May. In keeping with this finding, in 31 of 37 sites, the highest level for the year was observed in August through December. In four sites, mite bodies were counted, and the numbers increased sharply in June to July; however, they decreased in September in parallel with falls in humidity but several months before the fall in mite allergen. Ryegrass-pollen allergen in 12 sites was also assayed in house dust, and pollen-allergen levels demonstrated a sharp increase in May or June that fell back to preseason values within 2 months. Dust was also obtained from the houses of 50 patients with acute or severe asthma. The results on these samples suggest that mite-allergic patients are more likely to have attacks in the fall at a time when their houses have greater than 10 micrograms AgP1Eq per gram of dust. The magnitude of changes observed seasonally within individual houses and of differences between houses within a close geographic area suggests that interpretation of the relationship between allergic symptoms and mite-allergen exposure will require measurement of mite-allergen levels in individual houses.\r"

The status during the follow-up examination was as follows: 96 patients continued to work with red cedar, and 136 left the industry and had no further exposure to red cedar in their jobs or hobbies. Of the 136 patients who left the industry, only 55 (40.4%) recovered completely, whereas the remaining 81 (59.6%) continued to experience attacks of asthma of varying severity. The initial pulmonary function tests were significantly higher among the asymptomatic group compared to the symptomatic group (FEV1 99.3 +/- 2.7% versus 90.5 +/- 2.2% predicted, respectively). Methacholine PC20 during the initial examination was higher among the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group (1.46 +/- 3.96 mg/ml versus 0.77 +/- 4.52 mg/ml, respectively). These findings indicate that the patients in the asymptomatic group were diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease. This observation was confirmed by the significantly shorter duration of symptoms before diagnosis among the asymptomatic patients compared to the symptomatic patients (1.6 +/- 1.9 versus 2.6 +/- 4.3 years). Race, smoking status, immediate skin reactivity, and presence of plicatic acid-specific IgE antibodies did not influence the outcome of these patients. Of the 96 patients who continued to work with red cedar, 47 were exposed daily, whereas 41 were exposed intermittently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There has been concern in recent years as to the health hazards of exposure to potentially carcinogenic or immunotoxic substances in the environment. This study was done to determine the effects of exposure to urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) off products on various hematologic and immunologic parameters in subjects with asthma: complete blood count and differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lymphocyte subpopulations (E-rosetting, T3, T4, T8, B73.1, and Fc receptor positive lymphocytes and large granular lymphocytes), lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin and formalin-treated red blood cells (Form-RBC), serum antibody against the Thomsen-Friedenreich RBC antigen and against Form-RBC, and natural killer (NK), interferon (IFN)-boosted NK (IFN-NK), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Four control subjects with asthma from conventionally insulated homes (control group) and 23 subjects with asthma from UFFI-insulated homes (home group) were exposed to placebo, formaldehyde, dust, and UFFI off gas at levels ordinarily found in UFFI-containing homes for four separate periods in an environmental chamber. Immunologic testing was carried out before the exposure series and 1 day after completion 7 days later as part of an investigation of respiratory and possible allergic effects of such exposure. Data from the UFFI-insulated home group were not significantly different from data of the normal conventionally insulated home control group for any of the variables studied, either before or after UFFI exposure. Paired t tests comparing data from each of the two groups before and after UFFI exposure demonstrated minimal but statistically significant increases in percent eosinophils and T8 positive cells in the UFFI-insulated home group only. Although NK, relative NK, and IFN-NK were normal in all groups, IFN-NK assays by use of a low concentration of alpha-interferon demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in NK response to IFN in both the control and UFFI-insulated home groups after UFFI exposure. These differences were not observed at optimum levels of IFN stimulation. These data indicate that long-term exposure to UFFI off products in the home apparently had no effect on the immunologic parameters studied. Short-term exposure resulted in minor immunologic changes in this subject population.\r"

Subjects ingested 1000 mg of L-649,923 or placebo in a randomized, double-blind protocol and, two hours later, inhaled the dose of antigen known to induce a 20% fall in FEV1. Pulmonary function (specific conductance, FEV1, peak expiratory flow rate, and maximal flow at 25% of vital capacity) was measured at intervals before and up to 9 hours after antigen. FEV1 fell in one subject after L-649,923 ingestion. L-649,923 in the other seven subjects caused no change in baseline pulmonary function, a small reduction in the early response to antigen for FEV1, peak expiratory flow rate, and maximal flow at 25% of vital capacity but not for specific airway conductance (six subjects only) and no effect on the late response. The mean maximum fall in FEV1 in the early response was 1.35 L after L-649,923 ingestion and 1.78 after placebo ingestion. This relatively small degree of protection by L-649,923 suggests either that L-649,923 is not a sufficiently potent antagonist to diminish the effect of endogenous LTD4 in vivo or that LTD4 does not play a major role in the airway response to antigen challenge.\r"

A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, repetitive-dose design was followed at nine centers for 3 months. Patients received either 1.0 mg of bitolterol or 1.5 mg of isoproterenol three times a day with a closed, intermittent-flow nebulization system. Pulmonary function was evaluated on four 8-hour office visits at approximately 30-day intervals. Efficacy was based on a 15% increase in FEV1 over baseline. Both medications resulted in bronchodilatation within 5 minutes, whereas nebulized bitolterol was statistically superior (p less than 0.05) to nebulized isoproterenol in terms of duration of action and area under the curve. The mean FEV1 response to bitolterol therapy remained greater than 15% over baseline for 5 to 8 hours on the four test days compared to 2 to 4.75 hours for isoproterenol therapy. Both medications were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were transient, and most were mild to moderate. Tremor was the most frequent side effect occurring in approximately 30% of the patients in both groups. There were no clinically significant laboratory changes or electrocardiographic findings. Nebulized bitolterol mesylate was found to be a safe and effective bronchodilator in steroid-dependent patients with asthma.\r"

The 34-day intensive training exercise was associated with weight loss, depressed serum zinc levels, and elevated urinary zinc excretion. Alkaline phosphatase activity was not altered by the training exercise. The depressed serum zinc concentration could not be explained by the parameters measured. Weight loss was positively correlated with urinary zinc excretion. The functional significance of a depressed serum zinc concentration on performance deserves further study.\r"

Iron status was examined by analyses of variance. The effects associated with sex, race, age, geographic region, and other potentially confounding factors were included in the model. In both surveys, there were interactions with race. That is, the poor whites had lower transferrin saturation and iron intake means than the nonpoor whites, while the Food Stamp Program participants were no different from the nonparticipants in transferrin saturation. Within the nonwhites, the poor had a lower hemoglobin mean than the nonpoor, and the program participants had a lower hemoglobin mean than the nonparticipants. Therefore, the Food Stamp Program was not consistently associated with better iron nutrition of the elderly poor in NHANES I and II.\r"

Personal health habits related to not smoking and to getting regular exercise were significantly associated with belief in the importance of that behavior for others. Although most of the dietetic practitioners indicated that the identified health behaviors were important to the health of the average person, only a few practitioners gave them routine attention in their practice. Respondents generally expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to educate clients about specified health behaviors, with the exception of weight control, high-fat diets, elevated blood pressure, and exercise patterns. The practitioners' confidence in their counseling skills was significantly correlated with intensity of counseling (p less than or equal to .001) and the likelihood of client compliance, except in the area of weight control.

This study examined the accountability of a clinical dietetic staff by using an explicit procedure that made it possible for performance to be measured. Data were gathered at an urban teaching hospital to determine the nutrition care provided as compared with stated standards. Using the Policy and Procedure Manual as the written standard, the authors analyzed data from medical record audit, time utilization studies, staff interviews, and monthly reports. The level of accountability was very high, with less than 1 discrepancy in 10, for all the data collected. The dietetic staff members at the hospital verified the attainment of established standards by clearly and specifically documenting their services. It would appear that a decision about priorities and responsibilities had been made that was well supported by staff and institution. The establishment of a nutrition care team, in which clinical dietitians assumed a supervisory role that promoted and supported delegation to dietetic technicians and dietetic assistants, also contributed to good performance.\r"

Students majoring in health-related disciplines (e.g., dietetics) gain skills in promoting the six dimensions of wellness: social, occupational, spiritual, physical, intellectual, and emotional. Thirteen competencies provide the basis for training Lifestyle Assistants, who develop, market, present, and evaluate wellness sessions for the university and residential communities. Assistants earn academic credit or a wage. Of particular benefit to assistants majoring in dietetics are studying and operating a self-testing physical assessment unit, which approximates body composition, cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility; using a health hazard appraisal; assisting the University's Nutrition Task Force with its education campaign in the campus cafeterias; and presenting programs on popular nutrition topics (e.g., the athlete's diet). Program evaluation reveals that 84% of participants in programs conducted by assistants gained information of personal benefit. The Lifestyle Assistant competencies support The American Dietetic Association Plan IV minimum competencies in such areas as communication and education. The Lifestyle Assistant experience is in accordance with The American Dietetic Association's Dietetic Manpower Study recommendations: to provide student learning experiences in wellness programs and fitness settings.\r"

Two of the patients met DSM-III-R criteria for personality disorder according to the PDE. The patient group received higher scores on PDE items related to each personality diagnosis (P less than .01) except antisocial personality disorder. These preliminary data suggest that elderly patients with a history of major depression have more lifetime personality dysfunction than normal elderly individuals, although no specific pattern could be identified.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about how the care received in emergency departments (ED) by the elderly population differs from that received by younger people. We prospectively abstracted ED records of 1620 consecutive patients visiting a large community hospital ED over a 22-day period in 1984 for demographic and medical variables. Charts of patients presenting with five specific complaints (dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, syncope, and motor vehicle accidents) were also analyzed for process of care variables and, for patients hospitalized, the accuracy of the ED diagnosis. Older people (ie, those greater than or equal to 65 years of age) do not seem to be overutilizers of the ED for minor complaints, in fact, they tend to be more acutely ill on presentation than younger people. Older people were more likely to be hospitalized (46% v 10%, P less than .001), to arrive by ambulance (35% v 10%, P less than .001), and to have an identified source of primary care (95% v 64%, P less than .01). Older people stayed longer in the ED than younger people if they were eventually released home but shorter if admitted to the hospital. Test ordering patterns for specific complaints varied by patient age (eg, older patients had more electrocardiograms performed for chest pain and fewer urinalyses for abdominal pain than younger patients). Therapy for specific complaints showed less age effect. Although generally more diagnostic tests were performed on older patients, the ED diagnosis tended to be more accurate for younger patients. Our data indicate that the process of ED care may be substantially different for the elderly population and have implications for future planning and financing of medical care.\r"

To address this question, 44 primary caregivers of senile dementia patients and 44 matched controls completed a series of questionnaires and interview assessments. Caregivers reported significantly higher levels of depression and negative affect toward their relatives, and lower overall life satisfaction than controls. Caregivers also had significant impairment of their social activities, including visits with friends, vacations, and church attendance when compared with controls. Caregivers expressed less satisfaction with their social networks than did controls, but the groups did not differ in objective size of social network or number of network contacts. Caregivers reported poorer health, more prescription medication use, and higher utilization of health care than controls. Results clearly indicate the serious and wide-ranging effects of the stress of caregiving, and reinforce the importance of providing comprehensive services for caregiving families.\r"

Using the cut-off point (number of errors accepted) of three errors, the sensitivity of the test was 86.2% and the specificity 99.0% among medical inpatients. The percentages in the community sample were 66.7% and 100%, respectively. The validity of the SPMSQ was not as good for delirium because of its variable clinical picture. For screening purposes lower cut-off points than previously recommended should be used: three errors for dementia and two errors for delirium. Among Finnish elderly people it was not necessary to use correction for education in the SPMSQ.\r"

The elderly were significantly less likely to demonstrate cavitary lesions on admission radiographs or present with hemoptysis but were more likely to present with right lower lobe infiltrates and complaints of dyspnea. Symptoms prior to admission occurring with equal frequency in both young and old subjects included fever, anorexia, weight loss, and cough. Although treatment was delayed in the elderly, there were no age-related differences in mortality. Skin testing was underutilized in all patients regardless of age. The results support the notion that the clinical presentation of pulmonary TB is remarkably similar in young and old males.\r"

  ".W": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often described as an effective and safe treatment of depression in the elderly. However, we have previously reported that there may be increased morbidity in this population, particularly in the very old. This paper extends this work to a second, larger sample of 136 subjects of whom 40 are over 60 years of age. We have again found that while ECT is efficacious, complications increase with age (r = .26; P less than or equal to .003), occurring in 35% of the elderly as opposed to 18% of the younger group. This increased rate of complications appears to be accounted for by problems in the very old; six of eight subjects over 75 years of age had some untoward event. Common complications in the elderly included severe confusion, falls, and cardiorespiratory problems. Complications in the whole sample were related to health status (r = .22; P less than or equal to .008) which in turn correlated with age (r = .50; P less than or equal to .0001). Those taking a greater total number of medications and a greater number of cardiovascular medications had significantly more complications during ECT. There was no relationship between either complications and outcome or complications and the number or laterality of treatments. These findings confirm the effectiveness of ECT in the elderly but suggest there may be unappreciated risks of ECT in this population. At particular risk are the very old, those in poor general health, and those taking multiple medications, particularly cardiovascular agents.\r"

In order to determine whether thyroid dysfunctions could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders in the elderly, the prevalence of thyroid disorders was compared in a group of psychogeriatric patients and in a group of nonpsychiatric elderly patients. Thyroid function screening was performed in 157 patients consecutively admitted to a psychogeriatric unit, and the prevalence of hypothyroidism was determined in the different groups of psychiatric disorders (senile and multi-infarct dementia, organic brain syndrome of other etiologies, psychotic depression, neurotic depression, chronic delusional state, acute confusional state, and personality disorder). Thyroid function screening was performed similarly in 104 unselected elderly patients admitted to the medico-surgical admission unit of the University hospital to assess the prevalence of hypothyroidism in a general, nonpsychiatric, elderly population. Eight patients were diagnosed as hypothyroid based on an elevated basal thyrotropin (TSH) and on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test in the total number of patients, two in the nonpsychiatric and six in the psychiatric group. Three had clinical hypothyroidism, with decreased total and free T4 and T3 plasma levels in addition to increased basal TSH, five had biochemical hypothyroidism, with normal T4 and T3 levels and an excess TSH response to oral TRH. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in the two groups did not differ significantly (1.9% in the nonpsychiatric versus 3.8% in the psychiatric group). The prevalence of hypothyroidism in a subgroup of 88 patients with senile and multi-infarct dementia was 2.3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These rates were not higher in males than in females except in older age groups. Population rates were similar in blacks and whites except for higher rates among blacks in the greater than or equal to 80 years of age group, and average length of hospital stay was also significantly longer for blacks in this oldest age group. The magnitude of rates suggests a small impact of PDB on morbidity as assessed by hospitalizations.\r"

Women had higher age-adjusted mean levels of total cholesterol (p less than .0001), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than .0001), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than .0005), and weight/height (p less than .0001). Systolic blood pressure increased with age in both sexes, but the trend rose more sharply in women (p less than .0001). Both systolic (p less than .05) and diastolic (p less than .025) blood pressure increased with obesity in women but were unrelated to obesity in men. Approximately 70% (218) of the sample had elevated levels of at least one risk factor. This included 12% (38) having elevated levels of two risk factors and 1% (3) with three. The distribution of risk factors for coronary heart disease in this sample indicates a homogeneous population derived through selective survival remains by age 70 years. These results emphasize the need for additional investigations of genetic and environmental variables promoting longevity.\r"

Although changes in group mean weights were slight, 73% of the patients gained or lost 4.5 kg or more in 2 years. Patients who lost 4.5 kg or more in the interval had a lower 4-year survival rate (p less than .05) than patients who gained weight or remained stable. Fluctuations in weight may be more prevalent among institutionalized elderly persons than previously thought, or than are apparent in analyses of group trends. Monitoring an individual's weight is simple and may be more meaningful than comparison to a standard, especially because weight loss is associated with mortality, until age appropriate standards are developed.\r"

In addition, twice as many geriatrics clinic patients died (p = .10) during the study. Further clarification of the impact of a multidisciplinary geriatrics clinic on health outcomes and cost in VA and other settings are needed prior to recommending that this model of geriatric health care be adopted.\r"

The results showed differences in antibody levels by sex of the individual (p less than .01 pre and p = .04 at 1 month post), with women having lower antibody levels than men. Women responded better to vaccination than men (p = .05), but they also lost their acquired antibodies faster (p less than .01). No age effect and no effect of level of functioning were observed within this group of elderly individuals. Participants who died had high initial levels and responded well. Major differences between the six types were noticed. Type 6A exhibited the described pattern most clearly, whereas Type 3 often behaved in an opposite pattern from the other five types. We conclude that sex differences persist even among elderly adults, that high levels of antibodies are not necessarily an indicator of good health, and that much unexplained variation between antibody types exist.\r"

Baseline plasma NE levels were higher in old compared with young men (M +/- SEM, 355 +/- 58 vs. 197 +/- 22 pg/ml, p less than .02). Clonidine produced significant (p less than .05) dose-related reductions in plasma NE, NE appearance rate, NE clearance, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in both groups. There was no difference between old and young men in response to low dose clonidine. Following the higher dose, both groups had similar suppression of plasma NE (-51 +/- 7% vs. -58 +/- 2%, p greater than .05) and NE appearance (-60 +/- 6% vs. -62 +/- 2%, p greater than .05), but older men had a greater fall in NE clearance (-20 +/- 2% vs. -10 +/- 1%, p less than .003) and MAP (-28 +/- 3% vs. -10 +/- 4%, p less than .006). These findings suggest that sensitivity to alpha-2 receptor-mediated suppression of plasma NE and NE appearance is not diminished in elderly men.\r"

When this clinical trial was present, 12% of individuals had NPH on CT scan; when absent, only 3% had NPH. The clinical findings identified individuals with a 4-fold increase (p less than .001) of NPH on CT scan. Of the 50 individuals with the clinical trial, 6 had both clinical and CT scan findings consistent with NPH; 2 of these had shunt surgery, and 1 improved clinically. None of the 577 individuals without clinical findings had shunt surgery performed, including those with CT scan abnormalities consistent with NPH. We conclude that clinical characteristics can be used to identify individuals who need CT scanning for detection of NPH.\r"

Controlling for destination, we matched and compared the characteristics of older migrants from states of different distances. We looked at those coming to Arizona from California, Illinois, and Ohio, to the New York City suburbs from Pennsylvania and Florida, and to Chicago from Michigan and California. Repeatedly the story was the same. Distance was not an important factor; significant differences between these streams were rare. This analysis used the 1-in-100 1970 census public use microdata sample and used tests for identifying significant differences between streams.\r"

Young (6 months) mice exhibited a significantly more rapid rate of wound closure and repair than did mature (15 months) or aged (26 or 27 months) mice. The repair rate in mature and aged mice did not differ. Young mice, injected subcutaneously at the wound sites with rabbit antimouse macrophage serum (RAMMS) 5 min before wounding and on days 1 and 3 after wounding, exhibited slow delayed closure of cutaneous wounds during days 1 to 4 after wounding, similar to that of untreated aged mice. The early closure rate of mice injected with normal rabbit serum or physiological saline was rapid, resembling that of untreated young mice. The results suggest that cutaneous wound repair in mice is another physiological phenomenon whose rate of change is age related, but not necessarily progressive to senescence. The results also imply that macrophage functional decline may contribute to the slowing of wound repair in middle-aged and aged mice compared to young mice.\r"

In contrast to inbred C57BL/6J laboratory mice (Mus musculus), in which the rate of wound repair was more rapid in young than in mature or aged mice (Cohen et al., 1987), wound repair in Peromyscus was most rapid in aged animals. Aged Peromyscus (45 to 70 months) achieved 50% closure of cutaneous wounds within 3 to 4 days, whereas mature (23 or 24 months) and young Peromyscus required 5 to 7.7 days to reach the 50% closure level. Histologic indices were compatible with the more rapid rate of closure of the cutaneous wounds in aged Peromyscus. The reasons for the unexpected increase in the rate of wound repair with increasing age in Peromyscus are not clear but stress-related hormonal and cellular factors may play an important role.\r"

Maximal concentrations of SM-C/IGF-I (100 ng/ml) stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation equally in both early and late passage cells. Furthermore, dose response curves indicated that there was no alteration in the sensitivity of cells to SM-C/IGF-I with age. Preincubation with dexamethasone (10(-7) M) potentiated SM-C/IGF-I's mitogenic effect in early passage cells. In contrast, dexamethasone had no effect on SM-C/IGF-I stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation or replication of late passage cells. These data indicate that fibroblasts passaged in vitro have normal SM-C/IGF-I binding and are capable of responding to the mitogenic effect of SM-C/IGF-I. The synergism between SM-C/IGF-I and dexamethasone in stimulating DNA synthesis and replication of early passage fibroblasts is lost, however, in late passage cells.\r"

The results of Experiment 1 showed, in addition to an overall decline in recall across the three groups, an attenuation with normal aging of the memory advantage of concrete over abstract words. The SDAT group, however, did not show this attenuation. Experiment 2 compared word finding ability for concrete and abstract items. Word finding was significantly impaired in SDAT but not in normal aging. Furthermore, the SDAT group did much worse on the abstract items. This difficulty with the retrieval of abstract words can explain the unexpected concreteness effect in the SDAT group in Experiment 1. The attenuation of the concreteness effect was predicted on the basis of the communication hypothesis of age-related cognitive decline, which attributes age deficits to a breakdown of the memory network. The results are consistent with the reduced activation of information in this network.\r"

For all individuals there were more instances of tracking arrest during imagery task; however, a significant interaction of age with task showed that imagery coupled with tracking was an attention-engaging maneuver causing particular difficulty in older participants.

In the map condition, elderly adults had lower spatial memory scores than did young adults. In the room condition, however, the performance of elderly adults was not different from that of young adults. It was hypothesized that differences in the visual distinctiveness of the two contexts, map and room, were responsible for the interaction of age and task setting. An experiment using models of the map-room structures, models that differed in the visual distinctiveness of their components, confirmed this hypothesis.\r"

The accuracy performance of elderly adults was poorer in the speed condition than that of college-aged persons. In the accuracy and the speed/accuracy conditions, however, elderly participants responded as accurately as did younger participants, although the elderly individuals took longer on average to accomplish the image rotation tasks. The results of this study indicate that elderly persons may be more proficient at mental image rotation than has been supposed, particularly when the demand for speed in responding is tempered or eliminated.\r"

The elderly groups were chosen for their lack of medical problems in order to determine if previously reported age-related deficits were due to chronic medical problems or to aging per se. The resulting pattern of means showed statistically significant differences only for number of categories attained and total number of errors. For both variables, the 80- to 87-year-old group performed more poorly than the 64- to 69-year-old group. These results, although consistent with previous findings suggestive of frontal lobe vulnerability in old age, indicate that deterioration is less marked for a healthy elderly population.\r"

However, stools of all patients subsequently became culture-positive for C. difficile and occasionally had demonstrable cytotoxin. Except in one instance following oral antibiotic use, all patients remained free of symptoms. Resistance to either vancomycin or rifampin was not encountered. Biotyping of isolates with clostridial bacteriophages and bacteriocins suggested true relapse with the same organism in all patients studied, rather than reinfection with another strain. Vancomycin and rifampin in combination appear to be useful in the therapy of relapsing antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to C. difficile.\r"

We studied 69 consecutive patients with severe ulcerative colitis to evaluate whether an increased gas content of the small intestine may identify patients prone to TMC. The intestinal gas was measured on plain abdominal films by means of a planimeter. On the basis of gas values, 38 patients showed a normal and 31 an increased amount of small intestinal gas. The outcome of the disease (complications, need for surgery, and mortality rate) and 18 clinical and hematochemical findings were compared in the two groups. Of the 31 patients with increased gas, seven developed TMC, whereas this complication was not observed in the 38 patients with normal gas. The only other different features between the two groups were blood pH and base excess, which were significantly higher in the patients with increased small bowel gas content. We therefore suggest that persistent abnormal gaseous distension of the small bowel, together with severe metabolic alkalosis, characterizes a subgroup of patients with severe colitis at high risk for the development of TMC. The strict surveillance of these patients led to early recognition of seven cases of TMC and prompt institution of aggressive medical treatment. Since all these patients survived, the early detection of TMC may improve prognosis.\r"

Forty-one patients had isolated small intestine disease (44%), 37 ileocolic (40%), 13 colonic disease alone (14%), and two rectal or appendix involvement (2%). Statistically significant symptoms were fever and rectal bleeding with colon involvement, and number of liquid or very soft stools in 1 week with ileocolic or colon involvement. Statistically significant complications included intestinal obstruction with ileocolic disease, perianal fistulas, and arthritis with colonic disease. Increases in ESR, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell in patients with colon involvement were among the statistically significant laboratory findings. Gammaglobulin was significantly higher in patients with ileocolic or colon involvement than in those with small intestine disease. Red cell count and hemoglobin were significantly lower in patients with ileocolitis than in patients with small intestine involvement. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was significantly higher in patients with ileocolic or colon involvement than in those with small intestine involvement only. These findings confirm that colonic involvement renders the disease more severe than involvement of the small intestine. Surgery was required for 22 patients (24%) during a 2.8-year follow-up, but the difference among the three groups was not significant.\r"

The study population included 172 consecutive patients diagnosed as having chronic pancreatitis in the Gastroenterology Unit of the S. Giovanni Battista Hospital in Torino, Italy. Of them, 23 were found to be affected by cancer during the 14-year follow-up period. The incidence calculated using the person-year method was compared with data from the General Population Cancer Registry of Piemonte Region. The age-specific relative risks of cancer were increased manifold. Sex- and age-specific relative risks were markedly increased for liver, tongue, lip, and rectum tumors in males, and for liver, bone, and breast tumors in females. Selection bias did not seem to be an adequate explanation of this association. Survival curves were plotted by the estimation methods of Cutler-Ederer with year intervals for the complete study population and for the different type of cancer. Known risk factors and indicators for the expected tumors were evaluated by the Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Model. The incidence of cancer increases significantly with age but not with smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes. Our epidemiological study suggests an increased risk of pancreatic as well as extrapancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis compared with the general population. Cancer seems to be a main determinant in the natural history of the disease.\r"

SGOT, SGPT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum total bilirubin rose mildly but significantly 2 weeks after the institution of the supplemented fasting program. Thereafter, the values began to decline, approaching baseline levels within 4-6 weeks despite the continued dietary restrictions.

We present four cases illustrating the clinicopathologic problem and the pathologic appearances. One caused clinical concern because of its size and location at the site of former polypectomy. One was histologically confusing and raised the question of a vascular malformation. The third, seen at segmental colectomy after endosocopic biopsy of an adenoma, illustrates the gross appearances.

Only limited studies have been described previously to determine whether restricting determinants of DR and especially DQ are subtypic to the serologically defined DR and DQ specificities, and to what extent restricting determinants are associated with Dw specificities defined in alloresponses. In the present report, we describe a large number of CMV-specific Th clones derived from two different individuals who are seropositive for CMV. Clones were classified as being DR-, DQ-, or DP-reactive based on blocking with monoclonal antibodies. DR- and DQ-restricted clones were then examined in panel studies using antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the Dw subtype of the restricting DR-DQ haplotype, as well as APC expressing different Dw subtypes associated with the serologically defined specificity. Unrelated specificities were also included. Our findings show that not only for DR but for DQ as well, the primary restricting determinants appear to be subtypic to the serologically defined antigen; furthermore, subtype restriction for both DR and DQ is very closely associated with single Dw specificities. In several cases in which cross-reactivity among restricting Dw specificities was observed in association with a given DR or DQ haplotype, a molecular basis could be suggested to explain the cross-reacting determinants. A small minority of the clones appeared to be CMV specific, but was restricted by a determinant(s) that is either monomorphic or minimally polymorphic.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) was studied in the chicken bursa of Fabricius (BF) in both sexes from the time of hatching until the bursal involution. Steroid binding studies, immunohistochemistry, and autoradiography were used to characterize and localize the receptor. Three different polyclonal antibodies (IgG-RB, IgG-G3, and IgG-RB2) directed against the chick oviduct progesterone receptor were used for the studies. With immunohistochemistry, no receptor-positive cells were detected in the bursae of young chicks. The first receptor-positive cells were occasionally seen at the age of 10 wk in the frozen sections, not in the paraffin sections. In older female chicks, the staining became more abundant. In males, the PR was expressed only after estradiol treatment. The staining was located in the nuclei of the subepithelial and the interfollicular cells, which were probably mesenchymal in origin. The bursal epithelium and the lymphocytes were not stained. By using a combined technique of autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, we were able to demonstrate that the same cells also concentrated tritiated ORG 2058 (a specific synthetic progestin) in their nuclei. In steroid binding studies with tritiated ORG 2058, the receptor concentration after the age of 10 wk was 50 to 120 fmol/mg protein. Low-level ORG 2058 binding was also detected in young chicks of both sexes before the age of 10 wk. The progestin-binding molecule resembled the progesterone receptor of the chick oviduct in molecular size (studied with HPLC) and binding properties. The PR expression in the BF was preceded by the expression of PR in the oviduct stromal cells and by an increase in oviduct epithelial proliferation, indicating the BF is affected by factors associated with sexual maturation. It is concluded that the subepithelial and the interfollicular stromal cells in the BF, but not the epithelial or follicular cells, are estradiol-sensitive in both sexes immediately after hatching. The endogenous estrogens, however, are not able to induce PR until after the onset of sexual maturation, and only in females. This implies that estrogen and progesterone may affect the structural organization of the BF through the stromal cells, but probably not before the onset of puberty.\r"

Fetal jejunoileal segments obtained between 18 and 21 days of gestation were transplanted to a dorsal subcutaneous site on syngeneic adult rats. Three weeks later, intestinal segments greater than 2.5 cm in length were found in 70% of recipients. Each week for 6 wk post-transplantation, a full-thickness biopsy was obtained for histologic and immunohistologic examination. At the time of transplantation, fetal rat intestine did not display Peyer's patches, intraepithelial lymphocytes, lymphoid follicles, or IgA-containing plasma cells. These lymphoid structures reached adult levels by 4 wk after transplantation, and the sequence of development of the lymphoid structures in the transplants appeared to match the postnatal development of normal small intestine. After immunizing the in situ intestine or the transplanted fetal intestine with cholera toxin, the number of cells producing specific antibodies to the immunogen increased significantly in intestinal transplants and in situ intestine. In contrast, few if any cells synthesizing antibodies to cholera toxin developed in the transplants after i.p. immunization. This study suggests that fetal intestinal transplants behave as part of the mucosal immune system. This model may provide useful approaches to studying the development of mucosal immunity.\r"

We have characterized autoantibodies that are directed against this particle from two patients with rheumatic diseases. These sera immunoprecipitated the 7SL RNA from whole extracts of HeLa cells radiolabeled with 32P, but no RNA from deproteinized cell extracts. From 35S-methionine-labeled cell extracts, they immunoprecipitated a single polypeptide of 54,000 m.w. that is consistent with a known SRP component. Sucrose density gradient studies confirmed that this protein co-migrated with the 7SL RNA, indicating the likelihood that it is physically associated with this RNA. Thus, the 54,000 m.w. SRP protein, which is essential for the SRP functions of elongation arrest and translocation, appears to be a preferential target for human autoimmune responses. Human autoantibodies that recognize the SRP should be useful adjuncts to animal antisera for studies of the structure and function of this particle.\r"

Such recovered mice were found to develop signs characteristic of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) 2 to 8 wk after either immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or receipt of 1 to 2 X 10(7) lymph node cells from MBP-primed syngeneic donors. These two methods of disease induction were unsuccessful when applied to normal B6 mice or those previously inoculated with noninfectious SFV.

We also found that in individual sera, anti-PC antibodies are pauciclonal, as demonstrated by restricted spectrotypic patterns of the anti-PC antibodies. The IEF pattern of these antibodies were for the most part unique for each individual. In some sera, certain anti-PC antibodies with isoelectric points of basic pH bound PC conjugated to bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) but did not bind pneumococcal C-carbohydrate bearing PC determinants. In two individuals, we found that the spectrotypes that bound only PC-BSA were of the IgG1 subclass. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that within individual sera, human antibodies to PC are quite restricted in both V and C region expression, and furthermore, these V and C regions of human Ig may not randomly associate.\r"

The 75/3B12 IgG and F(ab')2 blocked ricin binding to cell surface galactose-containing receptors. The 75/3B12 Fab bound ricin D with a Ka of 10(7) M-1, and this binding was blocked by asialofetuin, lactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine--molecules which interact with the ricin galactose-binding site--but not by fetuin, sucrose, or glucose. The 75/3B12 Fab contained no detectable carbohydrate and, according to several lines of evidence, did not bind ricin via Ig carbohydrate determinants. The monoclonal antibody appears to recognize a galactose-binding site on ricin D via the variable region of the antibody. The 75/3B12 Fab bound ricin E only 1/50 as well as ricin D and bound the Ricinus agglutinin only 1/80 as well as ricin D. The antibody specificity indicates that structural differences exist in the galactose-binding sites of the Ricinus communis lectins. Abrin and other lectins which bind galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine were not significantly bound by the monoclonal antibody. In vitro, the antibody blocked the nontarget toxicity of immunotoxins similarly to lactose. However, in vivo, unlike lactose, the 75/3B12 antibody protected mice from ricin toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The basis of similarities in the mechanism of human platelet aggregation induced by soluble collagen and the dental plaque bacterium Streptococcus sanguis was analyzed. Structural and functional comparisons were made by using molecular probes, including rabbit antibody fractions reactive with components on S. sanguis and a synthetic, collagen-like octapeptide mimicking segments from cyanogen bromide fragments 6 and 4 of types I and III collagen, respectively. When platelets were pretreated with tryptic peptides or class II antigen of S. sanguis or with the synthetic, collagen-like octapeptide, the onset of aggregation in response to S. sanguis and collagen was prolonged. When compared to other peptides of similar size and charge, the collagen-like peptide's action towards platelets was shown to be selective. Indeed, absorption of antiserum to S. sanguis cells with particulate type I collagen removed specificities directed at a single S. sanguis antigen. These observations suggested that a common platelet-interactive immunodeterminant on soluble types I and III collagens, particulate type I collagen, and S. sanguis cells was present. Selective inhibition by antibody was used to show structural similarities between the S. sanguis surface proteins and collagen. When either agonist was pretreated with anti-S. sanguis IgG or Fab fragments, the lag time to onset of platelet aggregation was increased. Greater increases in the lag time to aggregation was seen when S. sanguis cells or collagen were pretreated with anti-S. sanguis IgG or Fab fragments made relatively specific for the class II antigen. Neutralization of the platelet-interactive action of the octapeptide by anti-S. sanguis antibody fractions showed that the immunodeterminant common to S. sanguis and collagen triggered platelets in plasma to aggregate. Although the anti-S. sanguis antibodies could inhibit fibrillogenesis, this action was apparently independent of interactions with platelets. In contrast, S. sanguis could bind or adhere to platelets by different determinants. Our data suggest that platelets have at least two distinct sites that bind collagen or S. sanguis. One of these may be a common site for collagen and S. sanguis agonists.\r"

Four of the antibodies form 1:1 enzyme-antibody complexes which are stabilized in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and have greatly reduced enzyme activity. In the absence of G6P, the 1:1 complexes convert gradually to a more active multimeric form. Reduction of the IgG inter-heavy chain disulfides partially relieves inhibition and removes the G6P requirement for stability. F(ab')2 fragments of one of the antibodies behave similarly to the intact IgG. Reduction of the disulfides in the G6PDH-F(ab')2 complex leads to complete recovery of activity. The activity of complexes of G6PDH with reduced antibodies or Fab with digoxin bound to the antibody or Fab sulfhydryl groups can be modulated with antibodies to digoxin. The anti-G6PDH antibodies bridge two identical epitopes of this two subunit enzyme and simulate the function of regulatory subunits in which anti-digoxin acts as an activator. The system can be used to provide a sensitive homogeneous immunoassay for digoxin.\r"

Suboptimal concentrations of ECP (10(-6) M) or MBP (10(-6) M) resulting in less than 10% killing were used in combination with cytoplasts. Cytoplasts alone in the presence of immune serum tested over a wide range of cytoplast:schistosomula ratios generated superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, but were unable to damage schistosomula. However, when a suboptimal ECP concentration (10(-6) M) was combined with neutroplasts or eosinoplasts, 43.9% +/- 8.5 (n = 7) and 24.7% +/- 9.8 (n = 3), respectively, of the schistosomula were killed. Oxygen metabolites were responsible for the synergism, because cytoplasts from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease were unable to act in synergy with ECP. In contrast to ECP, no synergism was found between cytoplasts and MBP (10(-6) to 2 X 10(-5)M). These results show that oxygen metabolites are important for the killing of schistosomula by lowering the concentration of ECP needed to inflict damage.\r"

These new mouse genes, arbitrarily designated mouse genes X and Y, hybridize specifically to three different cDNA probes derived from human CR1. The degree of hybridization homology between the mouse X and Y genes suggests they are very closely related to one another; however, the chromosomal localization of the mouse X gene to chromosome 8 and the mouse Y gene to chromosome 1 indicates they are distinct gene sequences. The mRNA species detected with the X and/or Y (X/Y) sequences are approximately 2000 bases in length, but vary in both quantity and size depending upon the tissue analyzed. DNA sequence analysis of a cDNA specific for the X and Y sequences indicates the mature protein(s) will contain the 60 amino acid consensus repeat characteristic of a group of other proteins including CR1, the C3d receptor (CR2), H, C4 binding protein (C4bp), the interleukin 2 (Il 2) receptor and others. The identity of the mouse X and Y genes, and the function of the proteins which they encode, is not known; however, the small size of the mRNA and the tissue specific expression suggests they do not encode mouse CR1 or CR2 but instead encode a related protein (or proteins) which is expressed in a wide variety of mouse tissues.\r"

We used a rat liver cDNA library in lambda gt 11-Amp3 to clone a 1370-base pair insert that coded for a polypeptide reactive with PBC sera. This insert was subcloned for expression into pBTA224, a plasmid vector in the same reading frame as lambda-Amp3. A positive clone, designated pRMIT, that expressed a fused polypeptide of 160 kd, was recognized by 25 of 25 sera from patients with PBC and none of 96 sera from normal persons or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic active hepatitis. This fused polypeptide was shown to correspond with the 70 kd mitochondrial autoantigen by several experiments. First, lysates of pRMIT in J101 absorbed out the 70 kd reactivity of PBC sera when probed against fractionated placental mitochondria. Second, affinity-purified antisera reactive with the fused polypeptide also reacted with the 70 kd mitochondrial antigen. Third, such affinity-purified antisera produced the characteristic anti-mitochondrial pattern of immunofluorescence on tissue sections. Finally, immunization of BALB/c mice with the fused polypeptide elicited antibodies to mitochondria. These murine antibodies reacted with the 70 kd mitochondrial protein and also produced typical mitochondrial immunofluorescence on tissue sections. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the recombinant protein, which encodes for approximately a 48 kd protein, showed no significant homologies with known proteins, and there were no homologies with mitochondrial genomic DNA. The availability of a recombinant form of the 70 kd mitochondrial autoantigen will allow several definitive questions to be addressed in PBC, including identification of B cell epitopes, T cell recognition, and a model of PBC in mice.\r"

MCA-induced fibrosarcoma from syngeneic mice. Animals that rejected TNP-1591-RE and subsequently TNP-3152-PRO tumor cells showed increased tumor-specific resistance to another challenge of 3152-PRO tumor cells, even when these fibrosarcoma cells had not been haptenated with TNP. Induction of protection required the presence of TNP-hapten groups on both 1591-RE and 3152-PRO during the initial immunization, and could be induced by immunization with other haptenated syngeneic highly immunogenic regressor tumor lines. In addition, TNP-haptenated progressor variants of the 1591-RE were ineffective in generating protection, suggesting that the immunogenicity of the haptenated tumor used for the initial immunization was a determining factor in whether or not protective immunity against the highly malignant tumor was later generated. Protection required at least two T cell types: a Lyt-1-2+ T cells, and a Lyt-1+2- T cell that also expressed I-J determinants and was Vicia villosa lectin adherent, suggesting it was not a classical helper T cell. These results suggest that presentation of a hapten by highly immunogenic tumor cells can lead to enhanced protective immunity to poorly immunogenic noncross-reactive tumors that co-express the same hapten, and rejection of these haptenated poorly immunogenic tumors leads to enhanced protection against a subsequent challenge of the same, but not noncross-reactive progressor tumors.\r"

On the average, 2.8% of peripheral blood lymphocytes differentiate in less than 24 hr into LGL when cultured with autologous plastic-adherent monocytes and the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji. The LGL precursors were intermediate-density lymphoid cells that were heterogenous for T3, T8, and Leu-7 antigens, negative for T4 and Leu-11, and positive for NK-9. During the transformation, frequency of Leu-11-positive cells increased and the cytotoxic activity was augmented. In single cell cytotoxicity experiments, the number of binding cells increased, whereas the number of killer cells among the binding cells remained unaltered. The transformation inducing factor was detectable in coculture supernatants of Raji and monocytes or Raji and the myeloid cell line ML-2. Analyses of the Raji-ML-2 coculture supernatants with reverse phase and gel filtration high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated that the factor is a heat- and trypsin-sensitive hydrophilic molecule with an apparent m.w. of 1000.\r"

Protein mixing experiments demonstrate that one of the two expressed DR beta molecules is electrophoretically variable (referred to as DR beta 1), and the other (DR beta 2) migrates constantly among DR2 subtypes. We have constructed cDNA libraries from Dw12 and FJO homozygous typing cells (HTC DHO for Dw12 and HTC FJO for FJO) and isolated DR beta cDNA clones. Four of these clones (FJO-13, DHO-8, FJO-6, and DHO-7) were sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with each other and with two published amino acid sequences for the DR beta molecules derived from a DR2-Dw2HTC. Prediction of the migration patterns on 2D-PAGE from the amino acid sequences of these and other DR beta molecules allows the tentative designation of the two full-length cDNA (DHO-8 and FJO-13) as coding for DR beta 2 molecules and the other two cDNA (DHO-7 and FJO-6) for DR beta 1 molecules. Amino acid sequence comparisons also show that the constantly migrating DR beta 2 molecules, as well as the electrophoretically variable DR beta 1 molecules, from Dw2, Dw12, and FJO have different primary amino acid sequences, including a clustered difference in the third hypervariable region of the polymorphic first domain.\r"

  ".U": "87196423\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study a gamma 1 kappa monoclonal antibody, Mab 25, specific for the receptor for the Fc fragment of IgE on lymphocytes (Fc epsilon RL) was established. This antibody was generated after fusion of spleen cells from mice immunized with the EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI 8866, which is known to express Fc epsilon RL at high density. Mab 25 inhibits strongly the binding of IgE to RPMI 8866 cells and to other Fc epsilon RL-positive EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. A 50% inhibition of IgE binding was observed at a Mab 25 concentration of 10 ng/ml. The binding of IgE was also inhibited by Fab fragments of Mab 25, suggesting that the inhibition is not simply due to steric hindrance or to an eventual binding through its Fc portion. Mab 25 only binds to cell lines expressing Fc epsilon RL. Mab 25 immunoprecipitated a single polypeptide with an apparent m.w. of 42 Kd, pI 4.9. The membrane molecule bound to and eluted from a Mab 25 immunoabsorbent had the same apparent m.w. and pI as the Fc epsilon RL purified from an IgE immunoabsorbent. Additionally, when RPMI 8866 cell lysates were cleared with Mab 25, no Fc epsilon RL could be bound to or eluted from an IgE immunoabsorbent. Mab 25 was found to weakly bind to a minor proportion of blood (1 to 4%), tonsil (2 to 9%) and spleen (4 to 5%) mononuclear cells with a low intensity. By double fluorescence analysis, most of the Fc epsilon RL-positive cells were found to be CD 20-positive B lymphocytes. The staining pattern of Mab 25 and the biochemical characteristics of the antigen detected by Mab 25 were comparable to those of the CD 23 Mab. The four CD 23 Mab MHM 6, PL 13, HD 50, and Tu 1 were found to inhibit the binding of IgE. PL 13 was found to totally inhibit the binding of Mab 25 to RPMI 8866 cells, whereas Tu 1 and MHM 6 only partially inhibited Mab 25 binding. HD 50 was unable to block the binding of Mab 25. The finding that different CD 23/Fc epsilon RL-specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes have in common the capacity of inhibiting the binding of IgE suggests that upon binding they induce a conformational alteration of the Fc epsilon RL resulting in a loss of the IgE binding capacity. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the CD 23 antigen is a low affinity receptor for IgE on lymphocytes.\r"

Thus, prior experience with the influenza viral HA appeared to have a negative influence on immune response to NA, the associated external glycoprotein, presumably on the basis of intermolecular antigenic competition. In a second study, sequential immunologic response to influenza viral NA was compared in college students who were immunized with either conventional commercial vaccine or an antigenic reassortant H7N1 vaccine, and who subsequently experienced natural infection with an H1N1 influenza virus. Although both vaccines were only marginally immunogenic in inducing NA antibody response in seronegative subjects, in vaccinees initially seropositive for HA antibody significant NA antibody titer increases occurred with H7N1 vaccine. Subsequent natural infection boosted NA antibody less effectively in the population previously primed by natural infection than in initially seronegative subjects primed by H7N1 vaccination. It is suggested that primary immunization monospecific for influenza viral NA may alter the subsequent pattern of immune response to one more favorable to the induction of NA antibody when virus is encountered.\r"

Sarcoma tissue from these donors was then implanted in the wing webs of suppressed or nonsuppressed recipients to compare the effects of immune suppression of donors and of recipients. Sarcoma tissue that had been excised from suppressed donors and implanted in the wing webs of nonsuppressed recipients evidenced a much greater capacity than sarcoma tissue from nonsuppressed donors to yield distal sarcomas localized to visceral organs and to induce expansion by infection-mediated recruitment of new sarcoma cells. In contrast, immune suppression of the recipients of sarcoma tissue from nonsuppressed donors was not significantly enhancing for these effects. The enhancement achieved by immune suppression of the donors correlated with a markedly increased level of virus production and viral antigen expression by the primary (wing web) sarcoma cells from these donors.\r"

It is currently believed that much of the tissue damage is immunologically mediated. To identify which antigens might be responsible for stimulating this continued inflammation, cynomolgus monkeys that had recovered from a previous ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis were challenged with various antigen preparations. Purified preparations of formalin- or UV-inactivated elementary bodies did not elicit any inflammation even with daily inoculation. In addition, neither purified chlamydial major outer membrane protein nor lipopolysaccharide, including recombinant organisms expressing the lipopolysaccharide group antigen, elicit inflammation. A soluble triton extract of the organism rapidly induced marked inflammation when inoculated in the eyes of immune monkeys but had no effect in naive animals. These studies suggest that the continual inflammation in trachoma may not be due to repeated exposure to chlamydial surface antigen(s) but rather to a labile product released by the living organisms.\r"

Levodopa, as well as carbidopa and 3 additional levodopa synthetic analogs, inhibited the transformation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated DNA synthesis at pharmacologically attainable levels. These results confirm our earlier preclinical observations suggesting that catechols have profound intracellular metabolic effects in a variety of cells other than melanoma cells. It is possible that some of the effects of catechols in other diseases might also be mediated by similar intracellular metabolic effects, and effects on human melanoma might be mediated in part through effects on the immune system. We are currently awaiting introduction of synthetic catechols, including 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine (NSC 263475), to extend these observations to our clinical studies in patients with advanced metastatic disease.\r"

The mechanism of action may involve interaction with the melanocyte-specific enzyme, tyrosinase, for which the cysteinylcatechols could become a better substrate than L-dopa itself. 4-S-Cysteaminylphenol was almost comparable to L-dopa in cytotoxicity, suggesting that this phenol might be oxidized to the corresponding catechol by tyrosinase within the melanoma cells.\r"

Epidermal sheets were separated from the skin of the glabrous part of hind limbs and ears of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment and stained for adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. The density of LCs of hind limb epidermis in male C57BL/6 (823 +/- 20/mm2) and BALB/c (1689 +/- 66/mm2) mice was significantly less than that in females (1363 +/- 52/mm2, p less than 0.001; 2249 +/- 105/mm2, p less than 0.001, respectively). Langerhans cell density in the ears of male C57BL/6 (465 +/- 24/mm2) mice was also significantly less than that in females (542 +/- 17/mm2, p less than 0.02). Although ovariectomy failed to bring about any change in the LC density of hind limb epidermis in female C57BL/6 mice, the LC density in male C57BL/6 mice increased significantly at 4 weeks following orchiectomy (sham operation, 564 +/- 27/mm2; castration, 1179 +/- 49/mm2, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that mouse epidermal LC density depends on sex, i.e., male mice have fewer LCs than female mice. The reduction in LC density in males may possibly be caused by the testis.\r"

Furthermore, the maximum response to LTB5 was only a mean of 38% that of LTB4 for mitogenesis and 70% that of LTB4 for chemokinesis. At an optimally active concentration of LTB4 (10(-10) M) the addition of LTB5 suppressed the enhancement by LTB4 of DNA synthesis in keratinocytes by a mean of 21%, 33%, and 54%, respectively, at 10(-9) M, 10(-8) M, and 10(-7) M LTB5.

The dietary introduction of n-3 fatty acids, such as EPA, may reduce the epidermopoiesis and neutrophil migration evoked by LTB4 through decreases in generation of LTB4 and the capacity of LTB5 to inhibit the effects of LTB4.\r"

The conditions under which these 4 compounds were administered (area treated, dose, vehicle, contact time, etc.) were similar in both species. The results showed that, in humans and rats, there exists the same rank order in total absorption: benzoic acid sodium salt less than caffeine less than benzoic acid less than acetylsalicylic acid. In both species there was a factor of 3 between the most and the least absorbed molecule. Although skin permeability varied significantly with the physicochemical nature of the compound administered, it also depended on the anatomic site involved. Independent of the molecule studied, the rank order of permeability of the sites tested in humans appeared as follows: arm less than or equal to abdomen less than postauricular less than forehead. There was a factor of 3 between the most and the least permeable sites. For each molecule and each anatomic site, the ratios of total percutaneous absorption human/hairless rat (back) were determined. For a given anatomic site and whatever the molecule tested, these ratios were constant. It thus appears that when conditions are carefully controlled, it may be possible, by measurements on animals, to predict the absorption of a compound in humans. Further experimentation with chemicals of varied physicochemical properties will be required for validation of the model.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to investigate the absorption of diazepam applied topically to the hairless mouse in vivo and to determine the diffusion of diazepam across isolated hairless mouse skin and human skin. [14C]Diazepam was readily absorbed after topical administration to the intact hairless mouse, a total of 75.8% of the 14C-label applied being recovered in urine and feces. Diazepam was found to diffuse across human and hairless mouse skin unchanged in experiments with twin-chambered diffusion cells. The variation in diffusion rate or the flux for both human and mouse tissues was greater among specimens than between duplicate or triplicate trials for a single specimen. Fluxes for mouse skin (stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis) were greater than for human skin (stratum corneum and epidermis): 0.35-0.61 microgram/cm2/h for mouse skin vs 0.24-0.42 microgram/cm2/h for human skin. The permeability coefficients for mouse skin ranged from 1.4-2.4 X 10(-2)cm/h compared with 0.8-1.4 X 10(-2)cm/h for human skin. Although human stratum corneum is almost twice the thickness of that of the hairless mouse, the diffusion coefficients for human skin were 3-12 times greater (0.76-3.31 X 10(-6) cm2/h for human skin vs 0.12-0.27 X 10(-6) cm2/h for hairless mouse) because of a shorter lag time for diffusion across human skin. These differences between the diffusion coefficients and diffusion rates (or permeability coefficients) suggest that the presence of the dermis may present some barrier properties. In vitro the dermis may require complete saturation before the diazepam can be detected in the receiving chamber. [14C]Diazepam was not detected in the receiving chamber of the Franz cell apparatus in experiments with human skin. This indicated that the rate of diffusion was less than 0.09 microgram/cm2/h. Since this diffusion technique more closely resembles topical administration to humans, these results appear to indicate that achieving therapeutic concentrations in humans may be difficult. In addition, the hairless mouse may not be a suitable model for predicting percutaneous absorption of diazepam in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Extracellular matrices (ECMs) play an important role as components of basement membrane of normal human skin and in migrating epidermal cells in wound healing. We investigated the effects of various ECMs on human keratinocyte adhesion and growth as well as on its secretion and deposition of fibronectin (FN) in vitro using a serum-free, low-calcium culture system. Since cell adhesion is the first step of cell growth, we performed cell adhesion assay for 14 h. Human keratinocytes adhered best on FN and less well on types I/III collagen, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as compared with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (control) or laminin (La). Cell growth assayed for 7-8 days on the dishes coated with various extracellular matrices revealed significantly increased keratinocyte growth on FN and on types I/III collagen in comparison with that on type IV collagen, HSPG, BSA (control), or La. Morphology of keratinocytes and of their colonies on FN and types I/III collagen was strikingly different from that of the control; the colonies were not so compact as in the control, but rather loose and larger; each keratinocyte was spread out more on these substrata. These morphologic features seemed to correlate with the increased keratinocyte growth on these extracellular matrices. Both immunofluorescence study for FN with keratinocytes in 8-day culture on various extracellular matrices and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for FN measurement on substratum or in conditioned medium with keratinocytes in 5-day culture demonstrated that extracellular matrices modulated the secretion and deposition of FN by human keratinocytes in culture; the keratinocyte growth correlated with the amount of FN detected on substratum but not with that in medium. Based on the results of the present investigation, we think that the growth of human keratinocytes depends on the amount of FN on substratum.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent tumor promoter, on epidermal differentiation has been studied by investigating the appearance of the epidermal differentiative marker protein, histidine-rich protein (HRP), in monolayer cultures of rat keratinocytes grown in low-calcium (0.1 mM) medium. Monoclonal antibody, 3F6-6, raised against the 60K HRP (HRPII) derived from the epidermis of the newborn rat was utilized to detect HRP in cultured keratinocytes. As a major component of keratohyalin in the cells of the granular layer in epidermis, HRP is not normally found in a monolayer culture of rat keratinocytes containing a high population of proliferating cells. However, when these cultures were exposed to 10 ng/ml of TPA, DNA and protein synthesis were decreased by up to 95% and 60%, respectively, and the cells in the monolayer culture became HRP-positive within 18-24 h. TPA has been shown to cause a withdrawal of the basal cells from the cell cycle and a commitment of these cells to an accelerated rate of terminal differentiation. Exposure to TPA at the same time that the calcium level of the monolayer cultures was raised to 2.0 mM in order to allow stratification resulted in positive immunostaining for HRP much earlier and much more intensively than in the absence of TPA. TPA also enhanced stratification of these cultures; however, the positive expression of HRP preceded the stratification. These observations support the view that the induction of terminal differentiation occurs independently of stratification and that the process of terminal differentiation (maturation) of basal cells precedes and triggers the movement of these cells to a suprabasal position (stratification).\r"

  ".W": "We have measured the RNA and DNA content and examined cell surface characteristics of human epidermal cells derived from normal skin, and lesional and nonlesional areas of psoriatic skin prior to and following treatment on a modified Goeckerman protocol. Our results show that cells from active psoriatic lesions contain greater numbers of basal keratinocytes when compared with either nonlesional skin from the same patients or skin from healthy volunteers and individuals with other inflammatory skin lesions. Follow-up measurements 2-3 weeks after the initiation of therapy showed that the numbers of basal keratinocytes in resolving psoriatic lesions had decreased and approached normal levels. Multiparameter RNA/DNA flow cytometric analysis on parallel samples from the same psoriasis patients revealed an increased growth fraction and proportion of cycling cells in both the nonlesional and lesional skin compared with controls. Furthermore, the cellular RNA content was elevated in lesional psoriatic skin when compared with either nonlesional or normal skin. Flow cytometric examination of nonlesional and lesional epidermal cells obtained 2-3 weeks after the commencement of therapy revealed that the growth fraction and mean RNA content of the keratinocytes from resolving psoriatic plaques decreased in response to therapy. In contrast, the proportion of keratinocytes within the S + G2 + M phases of the cell cycle remained elevated. These data indicate that \"uninvolved\" psoriatic skin exhibits characteristics more closely resembling lesional psoriatic skin than normal skin. The results further suggest that quantitation of cellular RNA content and basal cell number might be sensitive indicators of early treatment response in psoriasis.\r"

During the most intense period of influenza virus activity the rate of visits for ARD was about 12 per 100 persons; the risk of developing ARD was greatest for preschool children (1981-1982, 27 per 100; 1982-1983, 29 per 100) and averaged about 10 per 100 for persons greater than 10 years of age. The risk of hospitalization with ARD was about 10 per 10,000 persons for residents of Harris County (Texas) during the same epidemics and was greatest for persons greater than 65 years of age.\r"

The results confirmed the specificity of bacteriocin and bacteriophage typing of S. zooepidemicus; the technique also gave useful profiles on untypable strains. Strains with common bacteriocin and biotyping patterns from sporadic infections could be differentiated by their DNA fingerprints. In several outbreaks and incidents, more than one strain of S. zooepidemicus were encountered, and the importance of carefully interpreting typing data is stressed. Chromosomal DNA fingerprinting is a very efficient technique for demonstrating differences between strains of S. zooepidemicus, and its use is recommended for future epidemiological studies of this infectious agent.\r"

We studied 47 catheterized and bacteriuric women for almost 25 patient-years. The incidence of febrile episodes of possible urinary origin was 1.1 episodes/100 patient-days. Because these were diagnoses of exclusion, even this low incidence may be an overestimate. Most of these episodes were of less than or equal to 38.3 C (101.0 F), lasted for less than one day, and resolved without antibiotic therapy. Six deaths, half the total from all causes, occurred during these episodes, an incidence 60 times that during afebrile periods. Deaths and bacteremias were significantly associated with episodes of greater than or equal to 38.8 C (102.0 F). In the individual patient, these risks should be weighed against benefits of patient comfort, family satisfaction, and prevention and management of decubitus ulcers.\r"

Both strains colonized the intestine and invaded Peyer's patches with equivalent efficiency. However, the parent strain multiplied in mesenteric nodes and in the spleen; the plasmid-cured strain reached these organs, but the infection was low grade and remained relatively static until the mice developed active immunity and cured themselves. The histological response to plasmid-free strain LD842 was mononuclear, whereas the virulent parent strain produced abscesses. Sublethal irradiation of the mice before infection with strain LD842 prevented the mononuclear infiltrate in the liver and made the animals susceptible. Thus the virulence plasmid of S. dublin allows multiplication within the reticuloendothelial system and does not have any effect on the organism's ability to colonize the intestine or invade Peyer's patches.\r"

One control monkey (4) received repeated inoculations of HeLa cell materials only and remained normal throughout the experiment. Infection was confirmed by isolating the microorganism from both the endosalpinx and endocervix. Antibody to the infecting strains was demonstrated in sera, tears, and cervical secretions by using microimmunofluorescence. Mild chronic salpingitis developed in monkeys 1 and 3, and chronic follicular salpingitis developed in monkey 2. Peritubal and periadnexal scarring and endosalpingeal adhesion formation were produced after reinfection. The right fallopian tube of monkey 3 was distally obstructed (confirmed by hysterosalpingography). Systemic complications, including perihepatitis and conjunctivitis, were also documented in these monkeys. We conclude that repeated infections produced extensive tubal scarring, chronic salpingitis, and distal tubal obstruction, findings not apparent in primary infection.\r"

Evidence for division was obtained by the higher number of spirochetes per tick after a three-day feeding period than in the unfed females. Although the mechanism is unclear, some spirochetes become systemic by the fifth day of feeding and can be detected in low numbers in other tick organs. Spirochetes were also noted in the feeding cavities created by I. dammini in the dermis after five days of attachment. Spirochetes were not detected in salivary glands or in the feces of I. dammini during the feeding period.\r"

Antibodies to PC are present in most adults under the age of 60 years, are absent in very young children, and are present at low levels in Wiscott-Aldrich patients and in IgG2-deficient adults. These last three groups respond very poorly to polysaccharide antigens. Antibodies to PC are also found at low levels in the elderly, a group that has previously been shown to have low levels of antibody to blood groups A and B carbohydrates. The levels of antibody to PC over time were constant in most individuals and, in adults, seemed to show slightly less variation than did titers of antibody to blood group B. Our findings suggest that titers of antibody to PC may be superior to titers of antibody to blood group A or B for monitoring responsiveness to carbohydrate antigens.\r"

Serial liver biopsies were performed during a 12- to 20-month follow-up period to determine whether hepatic copper reaccumulates during zinc therapy. Mean baseline liver copper concentration was 255 micrograms/gm dry weight, whereas the mean value after therapy was 239 micrograms. No patient demonstrated hepatic reaccumulation of copper during zinc therapy. Copper balance, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and nonceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration all indicated good copper control during zinc therapy. Hepatic zinc concentration increased twofold to threefold over baseline values but no toxicity was seen. Hepatic zinc concentrations appeared to reach a plateau after 12 to 18 months of zinc therapy. We conclude that oral zinc as the sole maintenance therapy in patients with Wilson's disease prevents hepatic reaccumulation of copper.\r"

This model of glomerular disease, which uses a single intravenous injection of the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN), slowly progresses over 18 weeks with mesangial cell proliferation and FSGS as the pathologic hallmarks. We performed renal functional and histopathologic studies in 21 rats with chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis. Group 1 rats (n = 10) were fed a standard rodent diet containing 23.4% protein, whereas group 2 animals (n = 11) were maintained with a 6% protein diet replete with electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins. In those animals subjected to dietary protein restriction, proteinuria was significantly reduced at 14, 28, 84, and 126 days after PAN administration. In rats maintained with the 6% protein diet at 126 days after PAN delivery, there was also a significant reduction in the percent of glomeruli with segmental areas of glomerulosclerosis or hyalinosis and mesangial cell proliferation. We conclude that the renal functional and histologic consequences of chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis can be blunted by dietary protein restriction.\r"

The 30 patients with hemophilia included 13 who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (group 1), 11 who were asymptomatic HIV antibody positive (group 2), and six who were asymptomatic HIV antibody negative (group 3). Sera were obtained before and 4 weeks after immunization, and levels of antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay or by hemagglutination inhibition assay. All three groups of patients with hemophilia showed significantly higher preimmunization geometric mean titers of antibodies (groups 1 and 2, fivefold, group 3, 2.8-fold higher), with little increase after pneumococcal vaccine, when compared with controls. Defective humoral responses were noted in groups 1 and 2, with depressed antibody responses after influenza vaccine, significantly elevated levels of IgG and IgM, and depressed blastogenic responsiveness to pokeweed mitogen. Group 3 demonstrated normal responses to pokeweed mitogen, normal antibody responses to influenza vaccine, and normal level of IgG and IgM, although levels of IgG and IgM were higher than those of controls. These data suggest that humoral immune abnormalities are found frequently in patients with hemophilia who are HIV antibody positive. Further, prolonged administration of blood products, regardless of the recipient's HIV status, appears to be associated with polyclonal activation of B cells for T-independent but not T-dependent antigens.\r"

Crossed immunoelectrophoresis on heparin-agarose (H-CIE) and crossed immunoelectrofocusing (CIEF) runs were carried out on plasma and urine or dialysate samples. AT III plasma levels of the patients receiving CAPD were in the normal range, whereas levels in the patients with nephrotic syndrome showed a significant reduction. Nevertheless the AT III Ag daily loss was the same in both patient groups, so that an additional AT III loss caused by renal metabolism was suggested in patients with nephrotic syndrome. No alteration in the isoantithrombin plasma distribution was found in any patient. The AT III recovered in urine was almost all inactive, as demonstrated by the quantitative assays and by the H-CIE runs; on the contrary, the findings obtained by functional assays, H-CIE, and CIEF runs on dialysate samples failed to demonstrate any major alteration in the AT III molecule. In urine the AT III CIEF pattern displayed a more acid distribution (pH 4.9 to 4.5) in respect to the plasma AT III (pH 5.2 to 4.6); this pattern was suggested to be related to the renal AT III functional inactivation, whose exact mechanism remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of malnutrition on the gastrointestinal tract have been previously investigated in animal models using dietary protein restriction. Because malnutrition is clinically a consequence of reduced dietary intake of all macronutrients, we investigated the effect of restricting a balanced diet on intestinal disaccharidases and histologic conditions of rats. Our diet-restricted animals gained less weight (13 +/- 9 gm) than the control animals (158 +/- 27 gm) over the 5-week study. The proximal, middle, and distal small intestinal segments from the experimental animals had reduced mucosal protein content (15 +/- 4 mg vs. 24 +/- 7 mg). In these segments the total amount of maltase was slightly decreased, whereas sucrase and lactase activities were normal or increased. The intestinal villus/crypt ratios were similar in the experimental and control animals. Mucosal cell height was significantly reduced in the diet-restricted groups; however, cell width was normal. We conclude that severely diet-restricted animals have mucosal protein loss caused in part by reduced cell height, but that the disaccharidase enzyme activities are normal. Diet-restricted animals appear to have sufficient intestinal enzymes to support a normal amount of disaccharide hydrolysis.\r"

We investigated whether the remaining two volatile fatty acids, isobutyrate and isovalerate, are produced by degradation of amino acids. Stools from six healthy subjects were incubated with albumin, valine, leucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, glucose, or sucrose under atmospheres containing oxygen in the range of 0% to 5%. Isobutyrate was produced only from albumin and valine, and isovalerate was produced only from albumin and leucine. Glucose- and sucrose-containing incubates produced only acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The rate of production for each of the volatile fatty acids was constant over the various oxygen concentrations tested. We conclude that isobutyrate and isovalerate in stool are formed from valine and leucine degradation respectively. Quantitation of individual fecal volatile fatty acid excretions may reflect intracolonic degradation of protein and carbohydrate.\r"

The system used in this study will be invaluable in biologic studies of leukemic cell cycling and its manipulation. With the concept of leukemic cell-cycle manipulation established, new approaches to treatment of leukemia based on growth manipulation should be explored.\r"

So far, in vitro leukocyte aggregation has been studied by mixing patients' plasma or serum with leukocytes of a normal donor in a platelet aggregometer. We evaluated the leukergy phenomenon, that is, the occurrence of aggregated leukocytes in peripheral blood of patients with inflammatory disorders, as an alternative tool to the former method. Leukocyte aggregation could be induced by zymosan-activated plasma, phorbol myristate acetate, and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, as well as by the calcium ionophore A23187 in vitro in whole human blood. This aggregation was blocked by various lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathway inhibitors. Leukergy was diagnosed in peripheral blood of patients with inflammatory disorders and was generally not associated with elevated concentrations of immune complexes, lactoferrin, C3a des Arg, or C5a des Arg. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on leukocyte aggregation studies performed in whole blood. Such study permits evaluation of the aggregation phenomena of leukocytes in their natural milieu. Furthermore, it is possible with this method to obtain direct visualization of leukocytic aggregates in the peripheral blood of patients. The significance of our results and their possible implications are discussed in light of the pertinent literature.\r"

Pentose phosphate dehydrogenases and glutathione synthesis were not inhibited, de novo glutathione synthesis was negligible within the experimental time frame, and the reappearance of GSH was strictly under the control of GSSG-R. Results obtained with acetylphenylhydrazine or diamide were concordant. In red cells stressed by these reagents, GSSG-R deficiency began to impair the regeneration of GSH only after greater than 80% of the normal enzyme activity had been abolished. Thereafter GSH recovery deteriorated as drug-induced GSSG-R depression increased. Only erythrocytes that had been rendered almost totally GSSG-R deficient, that is, had lost greater than 90% of baseline activity, became functionally equivalent to GdA- glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient cells. The reserve capacity of GSSG-R in human erythrocytes is extremely large. Of all types of isolated GSSG-R \"deficiencies\" reported so far, only two can be considered pathogenically significant: the homozygous genetic defect found in a single family, and much more commonly, the acute pharmacologic phenocopy induced by BCNU.\r"

Labetalol administration resulted in a dose-dependent beta-receptor blockade as determined by an isoproterenol sensitivity test. It also produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial blood pressure that was of greater duration at larger doses. At the lowest dose labetalol produced a transient decrease in arterial pressure followed by a decrease in forearm blood flow and increase in forearm vascular resistance. As the dose of labetalol increased, the hypotensive response became more prolonged, but the changes in forearm blood flow and vascular resistance no longer occurred. Heart rate did not change significantly after any of these doses. Hepatic blood flow also did not change significantly after labetalol. Our results suggest that the increase in forearm vascular resistance after the lowest dose of labetalol probably was caused by unopposed alpha-receptor activation because the agent had a relatively greater beta-receptor blocking action at the low doses, but as the dose increased the alpha-receptor blocking action of the drug became more pronounced and abolished the vasoconstrictor effect in the forearm. Furthermore, our study indicates that despite the significant drop in arterial pressure at doses greater than 100 mg, blood flow is well maintained to the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulations during labetalol therapy.\r"

Rings of renal artery, with and without endothelium, were mounted in organ chambers filled with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution to record isometric tension. Both preparations contracted comparably to increasing concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/L) of norepinephrine, and only rings with endothelium relaxed with the application of acetylcholine. The contractile responses of the rings to increasing concentrations of either contrast medium or osmotically matched solutions of glucose were similar, suggesting that the primary factor for contraction was the osmolality of the bathing solution. No significant differences were observed between the responses of rings with and without endothelium, suggesting that the endothelium did not influence the contractile response. After exposure to the hyperosmotic solutions, rings were again tested for relaxation with acetylcholine. Rings that were prepared with endothelium relaxed with the application of acetylcholine, suggesting that functional properties of the endothelium were not affected by the hyperosmotic media. The results of this study indicate that the vasoconstrictor effects of radiographic contrast media such as meglumine/sodium diatrizoate are related to increased osmolality and are not influenced by the presence of endothelium.\r"

Based on tympanometry 31.3 per cent were found to have tympanograms indicating secretory otitis media. The otoscopic findings confirmed this high prevalence (30.0 per cent). At re-examination three months later, the point prevalence had decreased by almost 5 per cent which is well in accordance with the seasonal variation of this disease.\r"

Inhalers were prepared by adding 99Tcm-labelled Teflon particles (simulating the drug particles) to chlorofluorocarbon propellants, and scans of the head (and chest) taken with a gamma camera. Ten healthy subjects (age range 19-29 years) each performed two radioaerosol studies with the inhaler held in two different ways: either in a single position (vial pointing upwards) or in two positions (vial pointing upwards and then tilted by 30 degrees in the sagittal plane). The vast majority of the dose (82.5 +/- 2.8 (mean +/- SEM) per cent and 80.7 +/- 3.1 per cent respectively for one-position and two-position studies) was deposited on a single localized area in the anterior one-third of the nose, the initial distribution pattern being identical for each study. No significant radioaerosol was detected in the lungs. Only 18.0 +/- 4.7 per cent and 15.4 +/- 4.1 per cent of the dose had been removed by mucociliary action after 30 minutes, and it is probable that the remainder had not penetrated initially beyond the vestibule. Since the deposition pattern was highly localized and more than half the dose probably failed to reach the turbinates it is possible that the overall effect of nasal MDIs is suboptimal for the treatment of generalized nasal disorders.\r"

Hearing loss was a major complaint and was often found to be between 40-60 dB. H.L. Most patients admitted previous treatment, but otoscopy had rarely been performed. The medical profession in Tanzania cannot possibly deal with the large number of cases of chronic otitis media.

The classic description of the presenting signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy was derived from a series of ruptured ectopic pregnancies. To decrease the complications and preserve fertility, ectopic pregnancies must be detected before they cause tubal rupture. A family medicine center experience with the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy over a six-month period is presented. The study confirmed the expected frequency of this condition in this population but findings disclosed that the classic presentation was, in fact, uncommon. Implications for decision making derived from these case reports are discussed. A high level of clinical suspicion for this problem must be maintained.\r"

  ".W": "Vasectomy has gained wide acceptance as a safe, effective, and efficient method of birth control. Knowledge regarding the satisfaction of patients who have undergone the procedure has been well documented. In contrast, there is little data examining the attitude of men in general to the procedure or attempting to interpret these attitudes in a cultural context. Moreover, there appears to be widespread belief by providers that acceptance of the operation is poor among ethnic minorities such as Latinos and blacks. A questionnaire was distributed to 50 white and 50 Latino men at a large county hospital to determine ethnic differences in attitudes toward vasectomy. Only 54 percent of the Latino respondents stated they knew what a vasectomy was compared with 96 percent of the white respondents. Among respondents who knew what a vasectomy was, 50 percent of Latinos and 61 percent of whites stated they would not consider vasectomy in the event that they did not want more children. There was little support for the hypothesis that machismo played an important part in the negative responses by the Latino men or that fears of impotence played a role in the attitudes of both groups. This study suggests that a stronger emphasis on education regarding this procedure should be directed to the Latino male population.\r"

A majority of the patients (57 to 78 percent) wanted help for the four problems from their family physicians either independently or in conjunction with a specialist, whereas only 4 to 21 percent wanted referral to specialists exclusively. Desired level of family physician involvement was predicted (R2 = .291) by a series of reason for involvement variables representing the following conceptual areas: perception of value in talking about personal problems; perception of family physician background, time, and interest; and the Health Belief Model. This study supports the conclusion that family physicians need skills in managing psychosocial problems so they can provide the type of care that most patients want.\r"

One aspect of the relationship that has been overlooked, however, is that a major stressful life event frequently creates lifestyle changes that may increase susceptibility to illness. The purpose of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that daily stressors mediate the relationship between the stressful life event of marital separation and psychological distress. Seventy-nine women separated or divorced for less than three years completed measures of daily stressors and psychological distress on two occasions approximately ten weeks apart. The results confirmed the hypothesis that frequency of daily stressors is a better predictor of psychological distress than time since the life event of marital separation. The results also indicated that frequency of daily stressors maintains distress over time. These findings suggest that physicians should focus attention on evaluating the frequency and impact of ordinary stressors in daily life following a major life event.\r"

A survey of deans of US medical schools and department chairs of family medicine at the same schools highlights the divergent views of the place of family medicine in predoctoral medical education. Family medicine faculty must argue convincingly that medical education should not be limited to an information transfer process before they will succeed in having family medicine recognized as a required part of medical education throughout the country.\r"

Immunodominant peptides had molecular weights of 10.5, 11.5, and 13.5 kilodaltons. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed with the biotinylated-MAb and streptavidin peroxidase demonstrated sensitivity curves with lower limits of 10 ng of seminal fluid protein per microtiter well using 50 ng per well of monoclonal antibody-biotin conjugate. Cross-reactivity studies on a panel of human biological fluids and tissues demonstrated no cross-reactivity or false positives using the monoclonal antibody-biotin conjugate. The sensitivity of the monoclonal antibody-biotin ELISA was compared to ELISA based upon a polyclonal secondary antibody-peroxidase conjugate. These findings indicate that this ELISA assay, based on a biotinylated monoclonal antibody to a seminal vesicle-specific antigen, may be useful for semen identification.\r"

  ".W": "Most research on the aging process in the skeleton has not considered or elaborated differences that may exist between the races. Thus, techniques developed for the estimation of age assume that the racial background of the standards is compatible with the specimens to be assessed. However, racial differences in areas such as skeletal growth and bone density have been reported, along with specific variations in the aging process, in the ribs of disparate populations. The present investigation examines metamorphosis in the sternal ribs of American blacks (N = 53 males, N = 20 females), and tests the application of age estimation standards developed by the authors from a white population. All specimens were obtained from medical examiner's cases of known age, sex, and race. Although the sample was limited in both quantity and age range, analysis of the data revealed racial differences in both rate and pattern of metamorphosis. Statistical analysis showed that the calculated mean age per phase for black ribs was nearly identical to whites in Phases 1 through 4 or until the mean age of 28 years. By the early 30s, differences in morphology and their chronological association with the aging process became apparent and increased with age in both sexes. Blacks were consistently overaged from 3 to 10 years in Phases 5 through 7. Therefore, it was concluded that biological differences between these populations do exist and can affect age estimation from the rib. Social factors may also be involved, but they cannot be demonstrated from the available data. While the degree of interracial variation does not require completely new standards, the authors have suggested specific modifications of the white standards for use on black specimens.\r"

A pilot study of 1427 cases was performed to address this problem. The requisite statistical analysis for the prediction of PMI is inverse prediction. The 95% inverse prediction interval was found to be approximately +/- 20 h. The linear regression equation for the data was y = 0.238 chi + 6.342, with a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.374. This r2 value means that 62.6% of the variation of potassium is unaccounted for by the variation in PMI. Further studies are required to attribute this unaccounted variation to quantifiable factors. This would narrow the inverse prediction interval and enable vitreous potassium to be a useful aid in the prediction of PMI.\r"

After sensitization by anti-A plus B in Group O serum, the isotope bindings were observed in Groups A, B, and AB cells, while no significant radioactive count appeared in Group O cells. Furthermore, there was little significant isotope binding in both Group A and B red cells sensitized by the serum from Group A or B blood containing mainly IgM anti-A or -B.

A total of 69 (59%) victims met the criteria for acute PTSD, 19 of whom had a severe form. Although an inadequate degree of social support was more often noted in victims with severe PTSD, other demographic factors and degree of injury or property damage did not appear to be related to the presence of PTSD. Severity or presence of PTSD was supported by high scores on all HSCL subscale factors. These findings suggest a high incidence of acute PTSD in victims of natural disasters and the potential value of HSCL in screening for PTSD in large populations.\r"

The object of this study is to determine if United States Marines who were wounded in action in Vietnam were also at risk for an impatient admission with a psychiatric disorder. We also wish to examine the effect of the practice of returning psychiatric patients to duty upon completion of treatment on the relationship between combat exposure and psychiatric distress. Records of all hospital admissions for active-duty Marines for the period 1965 to 1972 were examined and personnel having a combat-related wound or injury and/or a psychiatric hospitalization were identified. Rates of first hospitalization were calculated and standardized incidence ratios were used to obtain measures of risk. Results indicated that, compared with Marines not wounded in Vietnam, Marines wounded in Vietnam were at significant risk for having a psychiatric hospitalization. Most of the psychiatric first hospitalizations occurred before being wounded in action, however, and psychiatric patients who were treated and then returned to duty had a significantly greater than expected risk of being subsequently wounded. This risk differed with respect to psychiatric diagnosis due to variations in the practice of returning psychiatric patients to duty on the basis of primary diagnosis. Variations in the probability of being returned to duty also accounted for variations in the relative risk of psychiatric first hospitalizations among wounded Marines by diagnostic category. These results cell into question the validity of using ratios of psychiatric casualties to numbers of wounded personnel as measures of the relationship between combat exposure and psychological distress.\r"

  ".U": "87197271\r", 
  ".W": "Analysis of consecutive emergency referrals to a community mental hospital over a 2-month period indicates that admissions are affected by a combination of demographic, clinical, and time factors. Both referrals and admissions were slightly higher in men. The mean age at referral was 44 years and of admitted patients was 30 years. Although married subjects constituted the largest group of applicants, widowers and divorced people were hospitalized more often. Both referral and admission rates were inversely correlated with education and employment. Most of the applicants came to the emergency ward accompanied by an escort. A lower rate of admissions was observed among those who came unescorted. The main indications for admission were acute psychosis and a nonspecific clinical state when the patient was defined as \"dangerous to himself or to others.\" The family constituted the main source of referral. Peak referrals were during the morning hours, but admission rates were highest at night. Referrals decreased gradually from Sunday to Saturday, but the rate of admission was practically steady throughout the week. We conclude that the decisions for admitting a patient to a mental institute are based not only on pure psychiatric criteria, but also on an intuitive approach, in which the admitting physician's personal and emotional factors may play a role.\r"

The MRI results have been correlated with the ultrastructural changes. The images accurately delineated the anatomical extent of the oedema in the two lesions, but did not otherwise discriminate between them. The patterns of measured increase in T1' and T2' were, however, characteristic for each type of oedema, and reflected the protein content. The magnetisation decay characteristics of both normal and oedematous white matter were monoexponential for T1 but biexponential for T2 decay. The relative sizes of the two component exponentials of the latter corresponded with the physical sizes of the major tissue water compartments. Quantitative MRI data can provide reliable information about the physico-chemical environment of tissue water in normal and oedematous cerebral tissue, and are useful for distinguishing between acute and chronic lesions in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Data from that review suggested that the presence of vertebral body collapse could have an important negative effect on the outcome of laminectomy. However, there was only scant evidence available in the literature to support that conclusion. Eighty consecutive patients with thoracic spinal cord compression due to a single metastasis treated by laminectomy are reported here. It is seen that the presence of vertebral collapse signified: a much reduced chance of regaining the ability to walk; a much greater possibility of further neurological deterioration; and a major increase in the incidence of post-operative spinal instability. The role of laminectomy in the management of such patients needs to be further questioned and alternative therapeutic measures such as radiotherapy, posterior spinal instrumentation or anterior surgery should be strongly considered in the presence of vertebral body collapse.\r"

Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the cortex, cervical cord, thoracic cord and conus medullaris was used to determine motor latencies to the biceps brachii, thenar eminence and tibialis anterior muscles. Prominent, and often asymmetrical, slowing of central motor conduction was demonstrated in seven of the 12 patients; these findings were most marked in the spinal cord and in most cases correlated with clinical features of corticospinal involvement. In general it was more difficult to excite motor pathways in the central nervous system in the patients with motor neuron disease than in control subjects. Evidence of subclinical involvement of central motor pathways was found in five patients. The central lesion in motor neuron disease may thus contribute more significantly to the clinical deficit than has been realised, since the clinical signs of the upper motor neuron lesion are often masked by the more obvious lower motor neuron features.\r"

A principal components analysis revealed four factors which were differentially related to severity of head injury and the presence of a frontal lobe mass lesion. Although our findings provide support for utilising clinical ratings of behaviour to investigate sequelae of head injury, extension of this technique to other settings is necessary to evaluate the distinctiveness of the neurobehavioural profile of closed head injury as compared with other aetiologies of brain damage.\r"

Although there was no relation between the cortisol and melatonin levels and headaches, the rise of cortisol following many attacks might in part represent an adaptive response to pain.

During the headache-free interval mean pupil diameter did not differ from values in non-headache controls. These findings suggest that migraine is associated with a sympathetic pupillary deficit which is greater on the habitually-affected side.\r"

Those patients who achieved a complete or partial (greater than 50%) response were evaluated for thoracotomy and the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes excised when feasible. Postoperatively, the patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation and were maintained on the same chemotherapy for an average of 11 months. Twelve patients were resected and found to have residual small-cell carcinoma in the operative specimen (ten) or no residual disease (two). Seven of these patients (58%) are alive without evidence of disease (median follow-up, 24 months). Seven other patients who were resected proved to have either residual foci or small-cell carcinoma mixed with adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma (four) or only focal areas of adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, or squamous-cell carcinoma with no evidence of residual small-cell carcinoma. Five of these patients (71%) are alive without evidence of disease (median follow-up, 36 months). Two of the 16 patients who were not resected but treated with chemotherapy and radiation are alive at 15 and 31 months without evidence of disease, the other 14 are dead of disease.\r"

  ".W": "To exploit possible dose-response and combination drug synergism, 20 previously untreated patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) received one or two courses of high-dose induction chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg), etoposide (1,200 mg/m2), and cisplatin (120 mg/m2) (HDCEP). HDCEP was followed by four cycles of standard-dose cyclophosphamide (1,000 mg/m2), doxorubicin (40 mg/m2), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2) (CAV). Response was determined after HDCEP and following CAV. Reevaluation included repeat bronchoscopy and chest computerized tomography (CT), as well as repetition of all initially abnormal studies. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Overall response to HDCEP was 90%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 65% (95% confidence limits, 44% to 86%) and a partial response (PR) rate of 25% (95% confidence limits, 6% to 44%). All patients either maintained or improved their initial response while receiving CAV. Median duration of response was 6 months (range, 2 to 12 months) and median survival was 9.5 + months (range, 2 to 21 + months). All 37 courses of HDCEP were associated with leukopenia (less than 1,000/microL), 92% with thrombocytopenia (less than 20,000/microL), and 84% with fever of greater than 38.5 degrees C. Additional toxicities included bacteremia (24%), nausea and emesis (59%), mucositis (57%), diarrhea (38%), and hemorrhagic cystitis (5%). There were two treatment-related deaths due to infection. A third patient died 4 months after completing HDCEP with pulmonary fibrosis. Although response duration and median survival were not improved, HDCEP produced a high CR rate in ambulatory patients with extensive-stage SCLC.\r"

Sixty percent of patients experienced significant side effects after each course of therapy.

In an attempt to minimize this complication, we initiated a protocol using low doses of radiation in conjunction with six cycles of MOPP (nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone) chemotherapy in newly diagnosed, pathologically staged children with Hodgkin's disease. Of 55 children treated in this fashion, the actuarial survival and freedom from relapse rates are 89% and 90%, respectively, with median follow-up of 7 1/2 years and maximum follow-up of 15 1/2 years. The local control rate is 97%. The previously encountered growth alteration did not occur when lower doses of radiation were used. However, three children developed acute leukemia. This study demonstrates that the vast majority of children with Hodgkin's disease can be cured with combined modality therapy. This experience provides long-term follow-up and thus serves as the basis for new ongoing protocols using low-dose involved field radiation with new drug combinations.\r"

Previously described techniques were used to calculate the average dose intensity of regimens containing one, two, three, or all four drugs of CHAP, relative to the standard. The average relative dose intensity, especially the relative dose intensity of cisplatin, correlated significantly with clinical response and with median survival time (MST) of the entire group (not just the remitters). There was a distinct advantage for multiagent regimens over single alkylating agents and especially for multiagent regimens containing cisplatin. Survival correlated with response rate (of multiagent regimens). This analysis suggests that dose intensity is a determinant of treatment outcome. Prospective randomized trials would be required to test whether, and to what extent, dose intensity determines outcome independently of total amount of drug given, performance status, or other factors. If dose intensity does determine outcome, methods of increasing it should be tested in an attempt to improve treatment results.\r"

This study further addresses that issue by eliminating some of the methodological weaknesses of prior studies and focusing on a more tightly defined patient population. Forty-nine female metastatic breast cancer patients were given a variety of psychological tests. At the time of the analyses, all patients in the study had died from their disease. Patients were evenly divided into short-term survivors and long-term survivors based on length of survival as calculated both from date of diagnosis and from date of testing. The results indicated that there were no consistent differences between groups on any psychosocial variable assessed. These data suggest that, for breast cancer patients with metastatic disease, disease-related variables probably outweigh the influence of select psychosocial factors in determining length of survival.\r"

  ".W": "The use of L-asparaginase during remission induction in patients with leukemia is associated with coagulation abnormalities, which may present either as thrombosis or hemorrhage. However, because of the multiple pharmacologic and hematologic variables present in these patients, the exact contribution of L-asparaginase to these coagulation abnormalities is unclear. We studied platelet function and plasma coagulation parameters in 12 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving daily L-asparaginase as a single agent when in complete remission. Changes in the prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen, while statistically significant, remained within or close to the normal range during the study. Platelet function also remained normal during the study. In contrast, levels of protein C antigen decreased to a mean of 42%, a significant change from pretreatment values. Levels of antithrombin III (AT III) were likewise depressed to 15 mg/dL (34% of pretreatment value). Despite these changes in the levels of physiologic inhibitors of coagulation, this schedule of L-asparaginase administration was associated with only rare clinical thrombosis, and this study suggests that the development of this complication may be dependent on the presence of additional factors.\r"

CNPE was apparently caused by toxicity of radiation/chemotherapy treatment rather than recurrent cancer. The occurrence of CNPE does not appear to represent enhanced toxicity of immediate (as opposed to delayed) concurrent chemoradiotherapy, but may be a consequence of the superior survival status of patients treated in this way. The onset of chest pain and/or dyspnea associated with increase in cardiac silhouette and positive echocardiogram allowed accurate diagnosis. Each instance was relatively easily managed by catheter drainage, and, for some patients, with the addition of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. It is important to recognize the possibility that a radiation/chemotherapy-related syndrome of pericardial effusion/tamponade may occur so that early diagnosis can be made and the risk of fatal tamponade avoided.\r"

  ".W": "Facial electromyographic (EMG) responses were monitored intraoperatively in 67 patients with hemifacial spasm who were operated on consecutively by microvascular decompression of the facial nerve near its exit from the brain stem. At the beginning of the operation, electrical stimulation of the temporal or the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve gave rise to a burst of EMG activity (autoexcitation) and spontaneous EMG activity (spasm) that could be recorded from the mentalis muscle in all patients. In some patients, the spontaneous activity and the autoexcitation disappeared after the dura was incised or when the arachnoid was opened, but stimulation of the temporal branch of the facial nerve caused electrically recordable activity in the mentalis muscle (lateral spread) with a latency of about 10 msec that lasted until the facial nerve was decompressed in all but one patient, in whom it disappeared when the arachnoidal membrane was opened. When the facial nerve was decompressed, this lateral spread of antidromic activity disappeared totally in 44 cases, in 16 it was much reduced, and in seven it was present at the end of the operation at about the same strength as before craniectomy. In four of these last seven patients there was still very little improvement of the spasm 2 to 6 months after the operation; these four patients underwent reoperation. In two of the remaining three patients, the spasm was absent at the 3- and 7-month follow-up examination, respectively, and one had mild spasm. Of the 16 patients in whom the lateral spread response was decreased as a result of the decompression but was still present at the end of the operation, 14 had no spasm and two underwent reoperation and had mild spasm at the last examination. Of the 44 patients in whom the lateral spread response disappeared totally, 42 were free from spasm and two had occasional mild spasm at 6 and 13 months, respectively, after the operation. Monitoring of facial EMG responses is now used routinely by the authors during operations to relieve hemifacial spasm, and is performed simultaneously with monitoring of auditory function for the purpose of preserving hearing. The usefulness of monitoring both brain-stem auditory evoked potentials recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp and compound action potentials recorded directly from the eighth cranial nerve is evaluated.\r"
