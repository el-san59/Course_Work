  ".W": "Randomized clinical trials make up only a small fraction of published articles concerning care of the newborn infant and an even smaller fraction of articles about all human subjects. The busy pediatrician who wants to keep abreast of the medical literature requires strategies to detect such relevant studies promptly and reliably. Computer searching of MEDLINE is an attractive, potentially powerful but not sufficiently validated means of achieving this goal. Therefore, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of two MEDLINE search strategies designed to detect randomized clinical trials for prevention and treatment of newborn diseases among all original articles about human subjects appearing in ten pediatric and general medical journals during 1985 were determined. The yield of both MEDLINE searches was compared to that of a manual search. Fifty-three randomized clinical trials of newborn care were identified by hand search among 233 articles concerning care of the newborn and 2,988 original articles about human subjects. The sensitivities of the MEDLINE searches were 53% and 34%, respectively, and the positive predictive values were 82% and 69%, respectively. Specificity of both computer searches was virtually 100%. Twenty-one randomized clinical trials were not identified by either MEDLINE search strategy, 17 of them for failure of the indexer to assign any methodologic terms at all or failure to assign sufficiently stringent methodologic terms. Consequently, sensitivities were higher, 77% and 68% respectively, when no methodologic terms were used during repeat searches. However, positive predictive values decreased concomitantly to 20% or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is based on computer searches of the relevant literature spanning the last decade and final reports regarding prevention programs to state and federal agencies. Although many programs have been implemented, relatively few have been evaluated, and of those that have been, many have serious methodologic flaws. Interventions that do appear promising include home visiting, lay counseling, group and family therapy, and education about sexual abuse. In addition, comprehensive programs that address the multiple contributory factors of child maltreatment appear to be a valuable approach. Suggestions are made as to how the practicing pediatrician might play a preventive role. Finally, there is a need for good evaluation research of prevention programs.\r"

The most frequently used screening instrument for detecting young children who are at risk for developmental delays is the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST). Although the DDST has excellent test specificity, overreferring few children, results from more than a dozen studies of the DDST's concurrent and predictive validity fail to replicate the original validation and demonstrate a uniformly poor sensitivity, ie, a high proportion of underreferrals. Whether samples are stratified by age, risk, duration of time between predictor and outcome, or type of outcome measure used, these studies demonstrate that the DDST underrefers children at nearly a 2:1 ratio. Several other screening tests with more optimal psychometric properties are presented. It is urged that caution be exercised in using tests for predicting the risk of developmental problems in young children unless the tests have acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity.\r"

Ultrasound scans had no effect on either variable. Women who had genetic amniocentesis had lower attachment scores before the procedure, but one month later the attachment scores were not significantly different from those of other women. Both maternal-fetal attachment and perceptions of fetal development increased significantly from 16 to 20 weeks of gestation. There was a small but significant correlation between attachment scores and perception of fetal development.\r"

  ".W": "While the cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains obscure, epidemiologic investigation suggests that environmental factors encountered years before onset could be responsible. Studies elucidating age-specific onset curves, worldwide distribution, epidemics, clustering, and risk of contraction after migration are consistent with the belief that MS may be caused by exposure to an infectious agent, possibly viral, at or shortly after puberty. Indirect evidence from serologic studies of serum and CSF shows elevated antibody titers to a number of viruses in MS patients. Although the absence of reproducible direct evidence of virus or viral remnants in brain tissue of patients with MS casts doubt on the viral hypothesis, it cannot be excluded. The theory that MS represents a complicated virus-host interaction with a secondary mechanism that initiates or prevents the process and its exacerbations implies that at least two components are present--one producing the disease and one immunizing against it. Results from studies of geographic distribution, migration, and age at onset make this model plausible. Further understanding of the molecular biology of viruses and results of epidemiologic studies of migration will help settle this argument and may lead to prevention of the disease.\r"

However, diagnosis of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament tears, patellofemoral subluxation, tibial tubercle fracture, and fibular head dislocation is challenging because they often present like common, less serious knee disorders. Accurate assessment of these five injuries depends upon the examiner's knowledge of the specific presenting complaints and the subtle clinical and radiologic findings associated with these conditions.\r"

A prolonged course of treatment entails significant expense. Further evaluation and clinical experience is necessary before use of third-generation cephalosporins for some of the newer indications (eg, late stages of Lyme disease, neurosyphilis) becomes routine medical practice.\r"

Other common causes of hand weakness include lower motor neuron syndromes involving the brachial plexus; cervical radiculopathy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and myasthenia gravis. Along with a careful history and physical examination, several tests are helpful in discerning the nature and location of lesions. Electromyography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and myelography may all be used to exclude or support a diagnosis.\r"

Thus, an algorithmic approach to diagnosis can be particularly useful. Because the sensitivity and specificity of many tests are not known, however, this approach is not perfect. Therefore, algorithms should be taken as a general guide to diagnosis but should not be applied too rigidly. In the past, algorithms for anemia did not apply any principles of decision analysis. The algorithm presented in this article is based on test operating characteristics reported in the literature. Disease is excluded by highly sensitive tests (screening tests) and confirmed by highly specific tests (pathognomonic findings). This algorithm can reduce the need for expensive, complex procedures, including radioisotope studies (eg, chromium 51 red blood cell study, ferrokinetics). It provides a rational and semiquantitative estimation of diagnostic possibilities. Alternate pathways to diagnosis may arise in individual cases. Also, the algorithm is difficult to apply to multifactorial anemias.\r"

Chemotherapy for cancer and bone marrow and organ transplantation also provide physiologic opportunities for candidal colonization. Topical therapy has the potential to prevent and treat candidiasis with less risk of side effects and drug interactions than systemic therapy. Among the effective topical agents are polyene antifungal antibiotics and imidazole compounds. Some of these agents have been found useful in prevention of serious candidal infection in high-risk patients; however, more study is needed in this area.\r"

This advantage is likely to be extended to the postmenopausal years by the current widespread prescription of estrogen (coupled with cyclic progestin) therapy. Currently available forms of exogenous estrogen preparations do not confer similar benefits on men, nor would their feminizing side effects be acceptable to men. Therefore, to narrow the sex differential in longevity, with its devastating burdens of loneliness and dependency on elderly women and monetary and time burdens on healthcare resources, men must adopt behaviors that reduce their risk of coronary artery disease. Such behaviors are cessation of cigarette smoking, early detection and long-term control of hypertension, and early detection and long-term control of dyslipoproteinemia (as best reflected in the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Fortunately, the recent advent of effective dietary and, especially, drug therapy for both hypertension and dyslipoproteinemia makes such approaches to reducing male cardiovascular mortality feasible, effective, and of acceptable cost in both economic and personal terms.\r"

  ".W": "The benefits of early ambulation and predischarge exercise testing for stable patients after acute myocardial infarction have been well documented. Early exercise testing can help stratify patients into risk categories; these can guide recommendations for further diagnostic testing for medical or surgical interventions, as well as suggest appropriate activity levels after hospital discharge. The scope of cardiac patients currently considered eligible for exercise rehabilitation is far greater than in the past. Exercise training can improve functional capacity, predominantly mediated by peripheral adaptations; guidelines must be developed for the exercise training and surveillance of severely ill and elderly coronary patients. Education in coronary risk reduction and counseling to limit psychosocial complications of coronary disease and encourage return to work when appropriate can improve the coronary patient's functional status and clinical outcome. Further research is needed to determine the rehabilitative needs of more severely impaired, medically complex patient subgroups and the most cost-effective means of delivering rehabilitative services.\r"

The oligonucleotide directs the nuclease activity of the enzyme to the nucleotides directly adjacent to the complementary target sequence on the substrate RNA. In the case of M1 RNA, hydrolysis occurs primarily at one phosphodiester bond, converting 50% of the starting material to product. Furthermore, the reaction products can be enzymatically manipulated: tRNA(Phe) was cleaved in the anticodon region and was religated to form the full-length tRNA in high yield. Because the specificity of these hybrid enzymes can be easily altered, they should prove to be useful tools for probing RNA structure and function.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize protein-DNA interactions involved in the initiation of conjugative transfer replication, we isolated and sequenced the transfer origins (oriT) of the promiscuous IncP plasmids RP4 and R751. The central initiating event at the transfer origin of a conjugative plasmid is the cleavage at a unique site (nic) of the strand to be transferred to a recipient cell. This process can be triggered after the assembly of \"relaxosomes\" (plasmid DNA-protein relaxation complexes), requiring plasmid-encoded gene products. We analyzed the nicking reaction for plasmid RP4 and demonstrated that one of the plasmid strands is specifically cleaved within oriT. The fully functional oriT of RP4 represents an intergenic DNA region of approximately 350 base pairs. Dissection of oriT revealed that a portion carrying nic and symmetric sequence repeats determines oriT specificity. This part of oriT is contiguous to a region that is essential for efficient mobilization of oriT plasmids. In addition, oriT contains potential promoter sites allowing divergent transcription of two operons flanking oriT. We over-produced gene products and, from analyzing the products of defined deletion mutants, deduced the gene arrangements. Formation of RP4 relaxosomes is likely to depend on the presence of at least two plasmid-encoded components, which act in trans. Corresponding genes map on one side of oriT. Purification of the traJ product revealed it to be an 11-kDa polypeptide that binds to oriT DNA in vitro. The protein recognizes the part of oriT that is responsible for oriT specificity.\r"

  ".W": "We recently found that many RNA polymerase II transcription factors are modified with N-acetylglucosamine residues. These sugar moieties confer upon transcription factors an ability to bind the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. We have taken advantage of this interaction to devise a purification procedure for the \"GC-box\" binding transcription factor Sp1. Crude nuclear extracts are first subjected to wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography and then subjected to sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. The Sp1 protein purified by this procedure is at least 95% pure, and the overall recovery is greater than 80%. In addition to yielding larger quantities of Sp1 than conventional schemes, the new purification procedure is also simpler and more rapid. We show that wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography can also be used to purify the glycosylated forms of the CCAAT-binding transcription factor. Thus, wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography may aid the purification of other transcription factors that bear N-acetylglucosamine residues. Furthermore, the ability to separate glycosylated forms of transcription factors from their unglycosylated counterparts by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography should facilitate investigations into the role of N-acetylglucosamine residues in the functioning of transcription factor proteins.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the kinetics of the process by which ribosomes are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm using Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected into the germinal vesicle with radiolabeled ribosomes or ribosomal subunits from X. laevis, Tetrahymena thermophila, or Escherichia coli. Microinjected eukaryotic mature ribosomes are redistributed into the oocyte cytoplasm by an apparent carrier-mediated transport process that exhibits saturation kinetics as increasing amounts of ribosomes are injected. T. thermophila ribosomes are competent to traverse the Xenopus nuclear envelope, suggesting that the basic mechanism underlying ribosome transport is evolutionarily conserved. Microinjected E. coli ribosomes are not transported in this system, indicating that prokaryotic ribosomes lack the \"signals\" required for transport. Surprisingly, coinjected small (40S) and large (60S) subunits from T. thermophila are transported significantly faster than individual subunits. These observations support a facilitated transport model for the translocation of ribosomal subunits as separate units across the nuclear envelope whereby the transport rate of 60S or 40S subunits is enhanced by the presence of the partner subunit. Although the basic features of the transport mechanism have been preserved through evolution, other aspects of the process may be mediated through species-specific interactions. We hypothesize that a species-specific nuclear 40S-60S subunit association may expedite the transport of individual subunits across the nuclear envelope.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) contains a single-stranded circular RNA genome of 1.7 kilobases. In this report we demonstrate that subfragments of HDV RNA can undergo autocatalytic cleavage. This cleavage requires at least 500 microM of Mg2+ or Ca2+, is not affected by varying the pH from 5.0 to 9.1, and occurs with RNA fragments as small as 133 nucleotides. The larger RNA fragments containing additional HDV sequences have a lower efficiency of cleavage. Deletion analysis at both ends of RNA subfragments suggested that the catalytic ability of HDV RNA resides in a stretch of no more than 117 nucleotides around the cleavage site. The cleavage occurs at the phosphodiester bond between nucleotides 688 and 689 on the HDV genomic map, generating a 5' fragment with a terminal uridyl 2',3'-cyclic monophosphate residue and a 3' fragment with a guanosyl residue with a 5'-hydroxyl group. The smallest autocleaving RNA does not contain the \"hammerhead\" sequence required for the autocleavage of other known self-cleaving RNA. The cleavage of HDV RNA occurs at a much faster rate, even at a very low Mg2+ concentration, than that of other \"ribozymes.\" Thus, HDV RNA represents a distinct class of ribozyme.\r"

Molecular weights of the protease obtained under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions (11,000 and 22,000, respectively) and chemical crosslinking studies were consistent with a dimeric structure for the active enzyme. The protease appropriately cleaved the nonapeptide Ac-Arg-Ala-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Val-Val-NH2 between the tyrosine and proline residues. HIV-1 protease was sensitive to inactivators of the aspartic proteases. The aspartic protease inactivator 1,2-epoxy-3-(4-nitrophenoxy)propane produced irreversible, time-dependent inactivation of the protease. The pH-dependent kinetics of this inactivator were consistent with the requirement of an unprotonated carboxyl group in the active site of the enzyme, suggesting that HIV-1 protease is also an aspartic protease.\r"

The choice of a tumor cell product for analysis was dictated by its relative abundance and an amino acid composition indistinguishable from that of lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor (LDCF), the agonist thought to account for monocyte accumulation in cellular immune reactions. By a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry, it was established that GDCF-2 comprises 76 amino acid residues, commencing at the N terminus with pyroglutamic acid. The peptide contains four half-cystines, at positions 11, 12, 36, and 52, which create a pair of loops, clustered at the disulfide bridges. The relative positions of the half-cystines are almost identical to those of monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), a peptide of similar mass but with only 24% sequence identity to GDCF. Thus, GDCF and MDNCF have a similar gross secondary structure because of the loops formed by the clustered disulfides, and their different leukocyte specificities are most likely determined by the large differences in primary sequence.\r"

Viral DNA replication started 2 days after infection, and replicative HBV DNA that included relaxed circles, single-stranded minus strands, and closed circles accumulated during 16 days of incubation. Immunofluorescent study using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit antisera directed against HBV core antigen revealed that this antigen is present in the nuclei in 12% of the infected cells. Particles containing HBV DNA were detected in the culture medium and were infectious. Thus, this in vitro infection system closely mimics infection in vivo and it allows detailed studies on early events associated with human HBV entry into cells and subsequent replication and integration.\r"

A similar increase in phosphate content is observed with desmin, from 0.5 mol of Pi per mol of protein to 1.5 mol of Pi per mol of protein. Fractionation of mitotic cell lysates by hydroxylapatite column chromatography reveals the presence of two IF protein kinase activities, designated as IF protein kinase I and IF protein kinase II. Comparison of two-dimensional 32P-labeled phosphopeptide maps of vimentin and desmin phosphorylated in vivo in mitosis, and in vitro using partially purified kinase fractions, reveals extensive similarity in the two sets of phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of in vitro polymerized IFs by IF protein kinase II induces complete disassembly as determined by negative-stain electron microscopy. The results support the idea that the disassembly of IFs in mitosis is regulated by the phosphorylation of its subunit proteins.\r"

We have raised antibodies in rabbits against two synthetic peptides representing the hydrophilic N- or C-terminal region of PrlA. Using these antibodies as probes in cell fractionation experiments, we confirm that PrlA is an integral membrane protein of the plasma membrane of E. coli. Fab fragments prepared from each of the two antisera specifically inhibit protein export by interfering with the binding of preproteins to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of preprotein binding and export by Fab fragments was shown in a cell-free translocation system: precursors for LamB (an integral membrane protein) and for a truncated form of MalE (a periplasmic protein) were first synthesized in a membrane-depleted E. coli-derived cell-free translocation system followed by posttranslational incubation with inverted vesicles derived from the plasma membrane of E. coli. Our data thus indicate that the N and C termini of PrlA are exposed to the cytoplasm. We discuss the possibility that the transmembrane segments of PrlA could be arranged in the lipid bilayer in a cylindrical fashion, thereby delimiting a protein conducting channel, with a signal sequence binding domain represented, at least in part, by the N and C termini of PrlA. Such a channel would also contain a \"stop-transfer\" sequence binding domain that in response to a stop-transfer sequence would open the cylindrical channel to the lipid bilayer and permit displacement of the polypeptide from the channel to the lipid bilayer, resulting in membrane integration.\r"

In addition, the centromere and proximal long arm region of a maternal chromosome 21 are duplicated in the r(21). Therefore, the mechanism in formation of the r(21) was complex involving two sequential chromosomal rearrangements.

  ".U": "89184551\r", 
  ".W": "The human high-affinity receptor for interleukin 2 (IL-2) has been proposed as being a membrane complex composed of at least two distinct polypeptide chains: p55 (alpha chain), recognized by the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (mAb), and p75 (beta chain), both of which are capable of binding IL-2. Whereas the alpha chain itself has been shown to be nonfunctional, the beta chain appears to be pivotal in the IL-2 signal transduction, although the beta chain is otherwise poorly characterized. Three beta chain-specific mAbs, designated Mik-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3, were developed. Mik-beta 1 and -beta 2 completely inhibited the IL-2 binding to the beta chain, whereas Mik-beta 3 immunoprecipitated the beta chain crosslinked with 125I-labeled IL-2. The beta chain immunoprecipitated by these mAbs was revealed to have a Mr of 68,000-72,000. High-affinity IL-2 binding was completely abolished by Mik-beta 1. Although IL-2-dependent T-cell growth at high IL-2 concentrations was not inhibited by the anti-Tac, it was almost completely inhibited by Mik-beta 1 in the presence of the anti-Tac. These results clearly indicate that the beta chain is an indispensable component to the high-affinity IL-2 receptor and is responsible for the IL-2 signal transduction. The beta chain was found to be constitutively expressed without the alpha chain on the surface of peripheral blood Leu-19+ natural killer cells.\r"

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the anti-idiotypic serum contains antibodies that carry an internal image of an internalization site on the toxin and that a cell-surface protein involved in toxin internalization possesses a complementary site recognized by both the toxin and the anti-idiotypic antibodies.\r"

The HIV-1 tatIII gene and the HBV X gene together increased HIV-1 LTR-regulated CAT expression above that observed with either gene alone, suggesting a synergistic effect of the X gene and tat. HBV X gene also stimulated expression of the CAT gene under control of the simian virus 40 enhancer and early promoter but not the visna virus LTR or the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) LTR, indicating that the HBV X gene can transactivate some but not other heterologous viral sequences. Transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by the HBV X gene varied in different cell lines, suggesting that it may be mediated by a cellular factor(s).\r"

Fractures of T. pallidum outer membranes contained scarce, uniformly sized intramembranous particles (IMPs). IMPs on the convex faces often appeared to form linear arrays that wound in spirals about the organism. In contrast to the outer membrane, IMPs of the cytoplasmic membrane were randomly distributed, numerous, and heterogeneous in size. In Escherichia coli and T. pallidum cofractures, IMPs of the E. coli outer membranes were densely packed within the concave fracture faces, while the T. pallidum fractures were identical to the experiments lacking the E. coli internal controls. Outer membranes of two representative nonpathogenic treponemes, Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter and Treponema denticola, contained numerous IMPs, which segregated preferentially with the concave halves. Examination of apposed replicas and deep-etched specimens indicated that at least some of the IMPs extend through the T. pallidum outer membrane and are exposed on the surface of the organism. The outer membrane of intact T. pallidum appears to contain a paucity of integral membrane proteins that can serve as targets for specific antibodies. These findings appear to represent an unusual parasitic strategy for evasion of host humoral defenses.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has shown that corticotropin releasing factor, vasoactive intestinal peptide, phorbol ester, and forskolin cause the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone and beta-endorphin from the AtT-20 mouse pituitary cell line. Human recombinant interleukin 1 alpha and 1 beta also stimulated adrenocorticotropic hormone and beta-endorphin secretion from AtT-20 cells in a time- and dose-related manner. The effect appeared only after pretreatment with interleukin 1 (IL-1) for at least 18 hr and was maximum at 24 hr. After pretreatment of the cells over a period of time with IL-1, the secretion induced by corticotropin releasing factor and vasoactive intestinal peptide was increased in more than an additive manner. The enhancement of corticotropin releasing factor-induced beta-endorphin release produced by IL-1 was apparent after 12 hr and reached a maximum at 24 hr. IL-1 did not affect forskolin-induced cAMP generation but enhanced the effect of forskolin on beta-endorphin secretion. This suggests that IL-1 does not induce adenylate cyclase and that forskolin causes the secretion of beta-endorphin by a mechanism independent of cAMP. IL-1 enhanced phorbol ester-induced beta-endorphin secretion. After prolonged treatment with phorbol ester (an activator of protein kinase C), the secretion induced by phorbol ester was abolished as well as the enhancement induced by IL-1. However, prolonged treatment with phorbol ester had no effect on IL-1-induced beta-endorphin secretion. These observations suggest that IL-1 enhances peptide-generated secretion of beta-endorphin by inducing protein kinase C.\r"

The present paper addresses the issue of whether these three receptors operate independent channels or whether they share channels that may have several conductance substates. The Xenopus oocyte provides a system for expression of exogenous mRNAs that permits detailed study of receptor structure and function. In oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA, NMDA has a stoichiometry of channel activation different from that for kainate and quisqualate. NMDA activates its own channels as indicated by simple summation or near-summation of currents evoked by NMDA with those evoked by quisqualate or kainate. Deviations from summation are ascribable to lack of selectivity in which an agonist at one receptor acts as a weak antagonist at another receptor. A further indication of separate channels is that block of NMDA channels by Mg2+ or phencyclidine has no effect on kainate or quisqualate responses evoked during the block. Interactions of kainate and quisqualate are more complex, but they can be explained by lack of complete specificity of these agonists for their own receptors.\r"

The chandelier cell is a well-characterized morphological type of gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing cortical interneuron, the axon of which possesses very distinctive terminal portions located around the initial axon segments of pyramidal cells. In the pre- and postcentral gyri of the monkey, we found that these distinctive terminal portions of chandelier cell axons were immunocytochemically stained for parvalbumin in a manner that reveals their complete structure. The chandelier cell axons were identified light-microscopically as short, vertically oriented rows of parvalbumin-positive puncta (PV-Rs). The PV-Rs varied in both length and complexity and were located beneath unstained pyramidal cells. PV-Rs were very numerous in layers II-III, where most pyramidal cells appeared to have a PV-R beneath them. Fewer PV-Rs were found in deeper layers, and in layer VI PV-Rs were rare. With EM all PV-Rs could be seen to form multiple synaptic contacts of the symmetrical type on the initial segments of pyramidal cell axons. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity can therefore be used as a reliable marker for chandelier cell axons.\r"

The glucocorticoid receptor and the B chain of insulin, therefore, share a cross-reacting epitope. Examination of the primary sequences of the two proteins revealed a limited number of regions of identity or close homology. Several peptides representative of those regions were synthesized. A heptapeptide sequence of the B chain of insulin with homology to a sequence in the first \"zinc finger\" of the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor was identified as the cross-reactive epitope. This heptapeptide sequence is restricted to and highly conserved among insulins of various species. Homologous sequences are found in the DNA-binding domains of most steroid receptors and related DNA-binding proteins. Consistent with this is the finding that 8G11-C6 inhibits the binding of glucocorticoid receptor to DNA-cellulose.\r"

The active enzyme contains a tyrosyl free radical whose formation requires oxygen. Earlier genetic evidence suggested that the enzyme is not required for anaerobic growth of E. coli, implicating the activity of a different enzyme or enzyme system for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis in the absence of oxygen. We now conclude from isotope incorporation experiments that E. coli during anaerobiosis obtains its deoxyribonucleotides by reduction of ribonucleotides. Extracts from anaerobically grown bacteria contain a different enzyme activity capable of reducing CTP to dCTP. To obtain an active enzyme, strict anaerobiosis must be maintained during extract preparation and during assay of the enzyme. The reaction is stimulated by NADPH, Mg2+, and ATP. Inhibition by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates suggests that the anaerobic enzyme has allosteric properties. Antibodies raised against the aerobic enzyme do not inhibit the new activity, and hydroxyurea, a potent scavenger of the tyrosyl radical of the aerobic enzyme, only weakly inhibits the anaerobic enzyme. The anaerobic enzyme has interesting evolutionary aspects since it might reflect on an activity that in the absence of oxygen made possible the transition from an \"RNA world\" into a \"DNA world.\"\r"

We have demonstrated that HIV LTR can also function as a promoter in Escherichia coli. A recombinant plasmid containing the HIV LTR linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene can express the enzyme efficiently upon transformation into bacteria. Mung bean nuclease analysis mapped the bacterial transcriptional start site of the promoter to the U3 region of the LTR, in contrast to transcription in eukaryotic cells, which initiates in the U3-R boundary of the LTR. The HIV LTR, besides being fully functional in E. coli, can also be specifically trans-activated by the HIV tat gene product. Trans-activation is demonstrated by an increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity as well as an increase in the mRNA level of the enzyme. This trans-activation of HIV LTR by tat protein in bacteria offers a useful system to investigate further the specific interaction between tat protein with HIV LTR and the mechanisms of trans-activation.\r"

  ".W": "The photocycle, electrical charge translocation, and release and uptake of protons from the aqueous phase and release and uptake of protons from the aqueous phase were investigated for bacteriorhodopsin mutants with aspartic acid-96 replaced by asparagine or glutamic acid. At neutral pH the main effect of the Asp-96----Asn mutation is to slow by 2 orders of magnitude the decay of the M intermediate and the concomitant charge displacement associated with the reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The proton uptake measured with the indicator dye pyranine is likewise slowed without affecting the stoichiometry of proton pumping. The corresponding results for the Asp-96----Glu mutant, on the other hand, are very close to those for the wild-type protein. These results provide a kinetic explanation for the fact that at pH 7 and saturating light intensities the steady-state proton pumping is almost abolished in the Asp-96----Asn mutant but is close to normal in the Asp-96----Glu mutant. Thus, the pump is simply turning over much more slowly in the Asp-96----Asn mutant. The time constants of the decay of M and the associated charge translocation increase strongly with increasing pH for the Asp-96----Asn mutant but are virtually pH-independent for the Asp-96----Glu mutant and wild-type bacteriorhodopsin. At pH 5 the M decay of the Asp-96----Asn mutant is as fast as for wild type. These results suggest that Asp-96 serves as an internal proton donor in the proton-uptake pathway from the cytoplasm to the Schiff base.\r"

Cells are mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold 2 x TSS and are immediately ready for use. Genetic transformation is equally simple: plasmid DNA is added and the cells are incubated for 5-60 min at 4 degrees C. A heat pulse is not necessary and the incubation time at 4 degrees C is not crucial, so there are no critical timing steps in the transformation procedure. Transformed bacteria are grown and selected by standard methods. Thus, this procedure eliminates the centrifugation, washing, and long-term incubation steps of current methods. Although cells taken early in the growth cycle (OD600 0.3-0.4) yield the highest transformation efficiencies (10(7)-10(8) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA), cells harvested at other stages in the growth cycle (including stationary phase) are capable of undergoing transformation (10(5)-10(7) transformants per micrograms of DNA). For long-term storage of competent cells, bacteria can be frozen in TSS without addition of other components. Our procedure represents a simple and convenient method for the preparation, transformation, and storage of competent bacterial cells.\r"

The ATF binding site can act as an efficient upstream activating sequence in vivo, suggesting that yATF is a transcriptional activator. The yATF DNA-binding complex is phosphorylated and the binding activity of partially purified yATF can be enhanced in vitro by the addition of protein kinase A, indicating that the phosphorylation state of yATF may be important in determining its ability to bind DNA.\r"

  ".W": "The energetics and kinetics of activation of the acetylcholine receptor are evaluated in the context of optimizing rapid synaptic transmission. Physiological needs are used as the basis for estimating optimal values for the closed-to-open channel equilibrium constants of the liganded and unliganded receptor. An estimate is made of the maximum energy that can be derived from the binding of acetylcholine to a perfectly designed receptor binding site. Application of the principle of detailed balance shows that with only one ligand binding site the receptor will not be able to derive enough energy from acetylcholine binding to drive a sufficiently large change in the channel conformational equilibrium. This then provides a rationale for the existence of a second binding site, rather than the often invoked advantage of cooperativity. With two binding sites there is a considerable excess of binding energy and consequently considerable flexibility in how binding energy can be utilized. It is shown that the receptor must have at least one binding site that binds acetylcholine weakly when the channel is closed. This is essential to rapid response termination. However, making the other binding site bind more tightly can enhance and accelerate the activation of the receptor. To optimize both response activation and termination the best solution is to make the two binding sites different in their binding affinities. This qualitatively reproduces an experimental observation.\r"

  ".W": "Midgestation embryos were infected with replication-defective retroviral vectors that either transduced the myc oncogene, the ras oncogene, or both oncogenes simultaneously. The myc virus induced tumors in diverse organs at a very low frequency and with a long latency period, while approximately 20% of the mice derived from embryos infected with the ras virus developed tumors in the skin with a latency of 4-8 weeks. In contrast, infection of embryos with the ras/myc double oncogene virus resulted in 27% of the animals developing rapidly growing and malignant tumors in a great variety of tissues after a median latency period of 2-3 weeks. All tumors were of monoclonal origin, as shown by Southern analysis using the provirus as a molecular marker. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ras and myc oncogenes cooperate in transforming cells, but that additional alterations are necessary for realization of the fully malignant phenotype. Our observations also suggest that a much wider range of cell types become targets for malignant transformation when the embryos are exposed to the myc and the ras oncogenes simultaneously than when exposed to the same oncogenes separately. Infection of mouse embryos with vectors carrying different oncogenes or oncogene combinations may be an efficient and rapid method for evaluating the spectrum of cell types at risk for malignant conversion following mutation of a protooncogene to a transforming gene.\r"

  ".W": "We have constructed a mutant form of the maltose binding protein precursor, termed preMBP*, that, unlike its wild-type counterpart preMBP, retains translocation competence after synthesis. In a homologous Escherichia coli translation/translocation system, preMBP* was translocated either co- or posttranslationally with virtually 100% efficiency into inverted vesicles (INV) derived from the E. coli plasma membrane. Translation of preMBP* mRNA in a wheat germ system and subsequent incubation with INV yielded no translocation. However, addition of increasing amounts of an E. coli postribosomal supernatant (PRS) to the wheat germ extract stimulated preMBP* translocation with virtually 100% efficiency occurring at 100 micrograms of PRS per 50 microliters of incubation mixture. The activity in the E. coli PRS appears to be identical to the previously described \"export\" factor. The soluble activity can bind to preMBP* posttranslationally and in the absence of ATP. Subsequent targeting to INV and/or translocation, however, requires ATP. Binding of the soluble activity to preMBP* thus appears to be the first step in a multistep translocation reaction.\r"

  ".U": "89184607\r", 
  ".W": "While the ability of the retroviral oncogene V-jun to transform chicken cells led to its discovery, the oncogenic potential of its cellular homologue, c-jun, which encodes a transcription factor, is unknown. We isolated a 1070-base-pair cDNA clone containing the unmutated entire open reading frame of c-jun from a human small cell lung cancer line. This cDNA as well as a 5.6-kilobase normal human genomic DNA fragment containing the c-jun gene were placed under the control of retroviral long terminal repeats and introduced into primary rat embryo cells (RECs), with or without other oncogenes, and into an immortal rat fibroblast cell line, Rat-1a, as a single gene. In Rat-1a cells the expression of human c-jun mRNA was associated with the ability to clone in soft agarose and form tumors in nude mice. When the c-jun cDNA or genomic DNA constructs were introduced into RECs, no foci of transformed cells were seen with c-jun alone or c-jun cotransfected with deregulated c-myc or L-myc protooncogenes. However, cotransfection of the c-jun constructs with an activated human c-Ha-ras gene led to foci of transformed cells which gave rise to immortalized cell lines that cloned in soft agarose and formed tumors in nude mice. Furthermore, formation of foci of transformed RECs by the c-jun/ras combination was augmented 3-fold by the tumor promoter phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate. We conclude that deregulated expression of human c-jun can participate in malignant transformation of normal mammalian cells.\r"

Under semipermissive conditions, Escherichia coli strains bearing these alleles form poorly growing colonies in which intracellular substrates are cleaved at EcoRI sites and the SOS DNA repair response is induced. Strains defective in SOS induction (lexA3 mutant) or SOS induction and recombination (recA56 and recB21 mutants) are not more sensitive to this in vivo DNA scission, whereas strains deficient in DNA ligase (lig4 and lig ts7 mutants) are extremely sensitive. We conclude that although DNA scission induces the SOS response, neither this induction nor recombination are required for repair. DNA ligase is necessary and may be sufficient to repair EcoRI-mediated DNA breaks in the E. coli chromosome.\r"

The two yeast proteins are highly similar to the translation initiation factor eIF-4A from mouse.

  ".W": "Mutations were induced in the supF gene of the pS189 shuttle vector by treatment with optically active benzo[c]phenanthrene (4R,3S)-dihydrodiol (2S,1R)-epoxide in vitro and replication in human cells. The induced mutation frequency was 60-fold greater than the spontaneous rate, and most of the mutations analyzed were transversions (86%), which principally consisted of similar numbers of A.T----T.A and G.C----T.A changes. The unusual susceptibility of A.T pairs to mutation by this chemical agent is consistent with its chemical reactivity toward adenine and argues that the mutations are targeted to the adducts formed. The central base in the sequences 5'-AGA-3', 5'-AAC-3', and 5'-GAG-3' was particularly susceptible to mutation. Twelve \"hotspots\" in the supF gene accounted for most mutations seen. Some of these hotspots differed from those found by others for racemic benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide and, even when a hotspot was common, the mutagenic changes were not always the same. Although adenine insertion opposite a noninstructional lesion could account for most of the data, no single mutagenic mechanism could encompass all of it. The cellular machinery that converts chemical damage to mutations must determine the mutational result to a large extent, but the findings herein show that the chemical agent itself plays a large role in determining both the location and the nature of the mutations that arise.\r"

  ".W": "Avian homologues of mammalian gamma delta and alpha beta T-cell antigen receptors, TCR1 and TCR2, have been identified with monoclonal antibodies. These TCR isotypes are associated with the avian CD3 proteins on the T-cell surface. During chick development, T-cell subpopulations bearing CD3/TCR1 or CD3/TCR2 receptor complexes are generated sequentially in the thymus and seeded to the periphery in the same order. In this study, we used two-color immunofluorescence to identify the subsequent development of a third subpopulation of T cells, provisionally named TCR3. These CD3+ cells, which expressed neither TCR1 nor TCR2, were first detected in the blood 1 week after hatching and increased numerically as a function of age to account for approximately 15% of the circulating T-cell pool in adults. Most (greater than 80%) of the TCR3 cells expressed the CD4 accessory molecule. The relative incidence of the TCR3 subpopulation increased dramatically as a consequence of embryonic treatment with anti-TCR2 antibody and thymectomy after hatching. Two disulfide-linked polypeptides, of Mr 48,000 and 40,000, were associated with the CD3 complex on the TCR3 cells. Examination of the TCR protein backbones and peptide mapping of the TCR chains after partial proteolysis indicated that the TCR3 heterodimer differs from both TCR1 and TCR2. These results suggest the existence of a third class of T-cell receptors in birds.\r"

  ".W": "Production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by leukemic cells was studied in 13 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. Intracytoplasmic immunofluorescence studies showed that the cells invariably contained the cytokine. Endogenous labeling studies demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemia cells produced either only the 33-kDa propeptide or both the propeptide and the 17-kDa mature form of IL-1 beta. The 33-kDa propeptide IL-1 alpha was always produced but was less frequently released. Involvement of IL-1 in leukemic cell growth was investigated using two antibodies specific for IL-1 subtypes, which inhibited spontaneous cell proliferation in the six cases studied. After acid treatment of the cells, a surface receptor for IL-1 could be demonstrated, which mediated 125I-labeled IL-1-specific uptake by leukemic cells. Furthermore, recombinant IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta induced significant cell proliferation in 10 of 12 cases. The above findings were uncorrelated with the cytologic type (French-American-British classification) of leukemia. Our studies suggest that IL-1 may act as an autocrine growth factor in most cases of acute myeloid leukemia.\r"

Histocompatible Fischer (F344/N) rats do not develop arthritis in response to the same SCW stimulus. To evaluate this difference in inflammatory reactivity, we examined the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its ability to modulate the development of the inflammatory response in LEW/N and F344/N rats. We have found that, in contrast to F344/N rats, LEW/N rats had markedly impaired plasma corticotropin and corticosterone responses to SCW, recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha, the serotonin agonist quipazine, and synthetic rat/human corticotropin-releasing hormone. LEW/N rats also had smaller adrenal glands and larger thymuses. Replacement doses of dexamethasone decreased the severity of LEW/N rats' SCW-induced arthritis. Conversely, treatment of F344/N rats with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 or the serotonin antagonist LY53857 was associated with development of severe inflammatory disease, including arthritis, in response to SCW. These findings support the concept that susceptibility of LEW/N rats to SCW arthritis is related to defective HPA axis responsiveness to inflammatory and other stress mediators and that resistance of F344/N rats to SCW arthritis is regulated by an intact HPA axis-immune system feedback loop.\r"

Both strains exhibited properties of HIV-1 biological subtype c: they grew slowly and induced few or no syncytia but eventually produced high levels of particle-associated reverse transcriptase in cultures of fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes, and they established stable infection of T-lymphoma (HUT-78) and monocytic (U937) cell lines. Each produced even higher levels of reverse transcriptase when fresh human monocytes/macrophages were used as target cells. The viruses were molecularly cloned after a single passage in culture, in order to minimize in vitro selection of subtypes present in vivo. Restriction-site analysis showed heterogeneity within each isolate. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a portion of the HIV-2D194 genome revealed that it is a member of the prototypic HIV-2 family, displaying 13% divergence versus HIV-2ROD and HIV-2NIHZ, as compared to 9% divergence between HIV-2ROD and HIV-2NIHZ. In contrast, HIV-2D205 is the most highly divergent HIV-2 strain yet described: it is equidistant in relation between the known HIV-2 strains and the simian immunodeficiency virus isolates from rhesus macaque monkeys (23-25% divergence).\r"

To increase the sensitivity for identifying mutations, we used histological enrichment, cell sorting, and DNA amplification by the polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction followed by direct DNA sequence analysis. Of the 40 carcinomas analyzed, 27 contained aneuploid cells and 26 contained mutations at the first position of codon 12 of KRAS2. Of the 12 adenomas studied, 4 contained aneuploid cells and 9 contained the same mutation at codon 12. In both adenomas and carcinomas, mutations were identified in both diploid and aneuploid cells. In some cases, regions of histologically benign mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma contained mutations. These combined results suggest that mutations in KRAS2 occur early in the development of human colon carcinoma, before change in ploidy, and that these mutations exist in diploid cells from which an aneuploid subpopulation arises. Furthermore, mutations may exist in histologically normal mucosa in regions adjacent to carcinoma, suggesting that a field of genetically abnormal mucosa may surround these tumors.\r"

These oligonucleotides bear ligands: for example, one can be biotinylated and the other can contain a site for a double-stranded DNA-binding protein. After linkage to an immobilized affinity reagent (such as a cloned DNA-binding protein, which we describe here) and labeling with a second affinity reagent (for example, avidin) linked to horseradish peroxidase, reaction with a chromogenic substrate allows detection of the amplified DNA. This amplified DNA assay (ADA) is rapid, is readily applicable to mass screening, and uses routine equipment. We show here that it can be used to detect human immunodeficiency virus sequences specifically against a background of human DNA.\r"

Such deletions are detectable by two-dimensional pulsed-field gradient electrophoresis (PFGE) in which the chromosomes separated in dimension 1 are cleaved with Apa I, and the sizes of telomeric fragments are determined in dimension 2. This sensitive technique has enabled us to examine the role of subtelomeric deletions in two aspects of the biology of Plasmodium falciparum. First, we show that similar subtelomeric deletions to those that occur in vitro also occur in field isolates. Second, we demonstrate a correlation between subtelomeric deletions and loss of the phenotype of \"cytoadherence\" in cultured isolates. Subclones were generated from the cytoadherent cloned isolate ItG2F6, and their phenotypes were examined with respect to cytoadherence, the expression of \"knobs,\" and agglutination of infected erythrocytes with rabbit antiserum. The only chromosomal change detectable by two-dimensional PFGE among subclones that differ from wild type in each of these three characteristics is a deletion of approximately 100 kilobases at one end of chromosome 2. This deletion includes the gene coding for KAHRP and the subtelomeric repeat designated rep20.\r"

The recombinant phage DNA was transfected into the lymphocytes of CD4-positive HUT 78 cell line to test the replication competence of the proviral DNA. One genomic clone, designated HIV-2SBL/ISY, yielded retroviral particles after a few weeks of culture of the transfected cells. The HIV-2SBL/ISY clone contained a complete provirus and cellular flanking sequence. We obtained the DNA sequence of the provirus and compared it with the published sequence of two other HIV-2 isolates. The degree of variability among HIV-2 isolates is comparable to that observed among African HIV-1 isolates sequenced to date. Immunologically, HIV-2SBL/ISY is similar to the parental virus (HIV-2SBL6669) but differs in the envelope transmembrane protein that is truncated (gp32-34) in the parental virus and not in HIV-2SBL/ISY (gp41). Both the parental and the cloned viruses are infectious and cytopathic for some human T-cell lines, induce syncytia, and infect a human macrophage cell line (U937) in vitro. The availability of a biologically active HIV-2 clone provides the means to study the role and interaction of HIV-2 genes in vitro as well as to assess the functional similarities among HIV-1 and HIV-2 genes. Since HIV-2SBL/ISY cloned virus infects fresh peripheral blood T cells from Rhesus macaques in vitro and infects the same animal in vivo, its use in animals may represent a model for functional study of viral genes in vivo as well as for development of experimental approaches to prevent and cure retroviral infection in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Two important pathogens of developing countries, Mycobacterium leprae, the etiologic agent of leprosy, and Leishmania donovani, the protozoal parasite that causes kalaazar, persist in the human host primarily in mononuclear phagocytes. The mechanisms by which they survive in these otherwise highly cytocidal cells are presently unknown. Since the best understood cytocidal mechanism of these cells is the oxygen-dependent system that provides lethal oxidants including the superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH), and singlet oxygen (1O2), we sought specific microbial products of these organisms that might enable them to elude oxidative cytocidal mechanisms. Phenolic glycolipid I of M. leprae and lipophosphoglycan of L. donovani are unique cell-wall-associated glycolipids produced in large amounts by the organisms. In this study, phenolic glycolipid I derivatives and lipophosphoglycan were examined for their ability to scavenge potentially cytocidal oxygen metabolites in vitro. Electron spin resonance and spin-trapping indicate that phenolic glycolipid I derivatives and lipophosphoglycan are highly effective in scavenging hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions. The results suggest that complex glycolipids and carbohydrates of intracellular pathogens that can scavenge oxygen radicals may contribute to their pathogenicity and virulence.\r"

  ".U": "89184655\r", 
  ".W": "Gonadal quiescence prior to puberty in primates results from a diminished secretion of the pituitary gonadotropic hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which, in turn, is occasioned by an interruption of pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus during this phase of development. A discharge of GnRH may be provoked from the hypothalamus of prepubertal monkeys, however, by an i.v. injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), an analog of the putative excitatory neurotransmitter, aspartate. Since this action of NMDA is blocked by the specific NMDA receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, the release of GnRH is likely mediated by NMDA receptors located either on the GnRH neurons themselves or on afferents to the GnRH cells. We report here that prolonged intermittent NMDA stimulation of GnRH neurons within the hypothalamus of the juvenile monkey for 16-30 wk results, with surprising ease, in the onset of precocious puberty with full activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis and initiation of spermatogenesis. These findings demonstrate that, in primates, the network of hypothalamic GnRH neurons, which in adulthood provides the drive to the gonadotropin-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary gland, must now be viewed together with the pituitary and gonads as a nonlimiting component of the control system that governs the onset of puberty in these species.\r"

Hearts isolated from rats pretreated with endotoxin 24 hr before also had increased myocardial function (decreased injury) after ischemia and reperfusion (Langendorff apparatus, 37 degrees C), as assessed by measurement of ventricular developed pressure, contractility (+dP/dt), and relaxation rate (-dP/dt), compared to control hearts. In contrast, hearts isolated from rats pretreated with endotoxin 1 hr before isolation or hearts perfused with endotoxin did not have increased catalase activity or decreased injury following ischemia and reperfusion. Aminotriazole pretreatment prevented increases in myocardial catalase activity and myocardial function after ischemia-reperfusion in hearts from endotoxin-pretreated rats. The results suggest that endotoxin pretreatment decreases cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and that increases in endogenous myocardial catalase activity contribute to protection.\r"

To provide a basis for discussion, we describe the multisystemic consequences of immobility from bed rest. We also discuss the role of body positioning and mobilization as therapeutic interventions that can be used to directly enhance all components of oxygen transport in patients with cardiopulmonary dysfunction. This approach may improve the efficacy of treatment in these patients and thus may address some of the limitations of current methods of practice. Further research is needed, however, to clarify and extend the application of this approach.\r"

Treatment of the affected teeth eventually includes extraction or surgical removal. To minimize the risk for this complication, we suggest that bone grafting should be done when the canine (or lateral incisor) is in an early stage of eruption and that orthodontic uprighting of the medial incisor should be done after surgery.\r"

We have used autologous cartilage grafts from the conchal bowl for reconstruction of the central lamella, reestablishing and augmenting support of the lower lid. The positioning of the graft is dependent on the specific anatomic deficiency, and the etiology of the lid retraction must be carefully evaluated. In patients with posterior lamella deficiency, the contracted lower lid retractors and conjunctiva are released and the graft is placed facing the bulbar conjunctiva and is allowed to reepithelialize. In patients in whom there is an associated skin deficiency, composite auricular grafts are used. We present our experience in 33 patients with lower lid retraction. Twenty-three patients required placement of a cartilage graft only, while 10 patients had an associated skin deficiency requiring placement of composite cartilage. In nine patients the cartilage graft was seated against the bulbar conjunctiva and allowed to reepithelialize. Reepithelialization was complete within 3 1/2 weeks in all but two of these patients. This technique has provided stable lid support in all 33 patients.\r"

The use of spared conchal structures as a transposition flap in combination with remodeling of the residual auricle and release of surrounding scar when indicated has been a useful technique in the reconstruction of a frequently occurring type of postburn ear deformity. Twenty-four ears have been reconstructed in 18 patients over the past 5 years using a conchal transposition flap. The residual concha with its overlying skin can be transposed superiorly, based on a very narrow pedicle in the area of the crus helicis. The raw central area remaining is then resurfaced with a split-thickness skin graft. This technique maximally utilizes the unique remaining auricular elements and can provide a satisfactory reconstruction in selected patients without resorting to more complex and extensive procedures. There have been no significant complications in this series, and patient acceptance of the results has been excellent.\r"

Thirteen patients (46 percent) were admitted to the Shriners Burns Institute in Galveston for acute care of their burns. Fifteen patients (54 percent) were referred for long-term follow-up or specific reconstructive procedures following care of the acute burns. In spite of significant thermal injury to the anterior chest wall with involvement of the nipple-areolar complex, no patient failed to develop breasts. Twenty patients (71 percent) required releases of the anterior chest wall to assist breast development. All anterior chest wall releases were accomplished with the use of skin grafts or local skin flaps.\r"

The flaps are raised bilaterally in the groin crease just lateral to the labia majora and then are transposed toward the midline and sutured together to form a skin-lined cul-de-sac which opens at the introitus. The technique has been used successfully in three patients to reconstruct the vagina. The first patient, an adult, was reconstructed after total pelvic exenteration for malignancy, while two children had reconstructions for congenital vaginal anomalies. This technique is superior to currently available methods because it is simple and reliable. No stents or dilators are needed. It is safe technique without complications in our hands. The reconstructed vagina has a natural angle for intercourse and is sensate. The donor scars in the groin are well hidden.\r"

Additional efforts to improve present equipment are paramount, and further studies should be encouraged to establish the optimal conditions for the delivery and temperature monitoring of local hyperthermia combined with irradiation or cytotoxic agents. It is possible to induce tumor regression and produce satisfactory palliative results in selected groups of patients with recurrent or advanced tumors.

With the present SIMFU system, it was possible to heat 88 per cent of deep tumors up to 12 cm in depth and 15 cm in diameter, to 43 degrees C in 3 to 4 minutes. The infiltrative tumor margins could be heated to the desired therapeutic temperature. The temperature outside the treatment field fell off sharply. Excellent objective responses were obtained without local or systemic toxicity. Multiinstitutional clinical trials of local hyperthermia by this promising technique are clearly warranted.\r"

  ".U": "89185435\r", 
  ".W": "Hyperthermia, the elevation of body or tissue temperature, has been used to treat various ailments including cancer since ancient times. During the past 15 years, laboratory evidence has developed to provide a scientific rationale for its use in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. Generally, temperatures in excess of 41 degrees C in vitro will kill neoplastic cells exponentially as a function of time. The direct cytotoxic effects of heat alone, however, may have limited clinical utility due to poor response rates and response durations. The greatest potential of hyperthermia resides in its use as an adjunct to other forms of therapy. As hyperthermia is nonmyelosuppressive and can potentiate the tumoricidal effects of radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, its use as part of a multimodality treatment approach is attractive. Three forms of hyperthermia have been developed for clinical application: local, regional, and whole body. As WBH addresses the issue of cancer as a systemic disease, it has perhaps the greatest potential for curative success when used as an adjunct to other therapeutic modalities. Using a variety of WBH methodologies, core temperatures have been maintained at 41 degrees C or 42 degrees C in humans for several hours with variable morbidity and occasional mortality. Most systems for WBH include a requirement for general anesthesia, as well as complex equipment to regulate patient temperature. The system most used to date worldwide is based on extracorporeal heating. A hot water suit system, developed at the National Cancer Institute, has also undergone extensive testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hyperthermia may act additively or synergistically with a majority of clinically useful chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. In some cases enhanced responses are essentially linear at temperatures from 39 to 43 degrees C (thiotepa, the nitrosoureas, cisplatin), while other drugs become more effective only at 42 to 43 degrees (doxorubicin, bleomycin, amphotericin B). Synergism has been observed in vivo with methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, the nitrosoureas, doxorubicin, bleomycin, and cisplatin. Optimum enhancement occurs when heat and drug are given simultaneously. Clinical studies employing WBH at 41 to 41.8 degrees C have shown evidence of potential usefulness, but have been limited by high toxicity and a low benefit-to-risk ratio. Regional perfusion of metastatic melanoma of the extremity treated with L-phenylalanine mustard at 40 to 41 degrees C was significantly better than when treated with the drug alone, but some investigations suggest that heat alone may be just as effective. Localized hyperthermia combined with nearly all the standard types and doses of single and combination agents has shown objective responses in about one third of patients treated, without evidence of increased drug toxicity by either the IV or IA route. Responses appear to be thermal-dose related. Maximum enhancement appears at about 40 to 43 degrees C and prior drug resistance does not appear to confer heat resistance. The lack of enhanced drug toxicity with loco-regional hyperthermia with potential improvement in response of advanced disease suggests that thermochemotherapy is a viable and important option to drug treatment alone. Further in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies are needed to increase our understanding of drug-heat interactions for the optimization of therapy.\r"

For the case of a choice between surface coils or between a surface and a whole- or partial-volume coil, the anatomic region should lie on the high side of the crossover point. For the case of a choice among whole-volume coils, the smallest coil that surrounds the region of interest should be chosen. 4. Considerations in regard to the anatomic shape or the need to vary the position of the structure may alter the choice of coil from that obtained by S/N considerations alone.\r"

In particular, an abnormal configuration of the cerebellum, known as the banana sign, has been associated with neural tube defects. To further evaluate the usefulness of this sign, the authors compared images of the posterior fossa in 23 fetuses who had documented neural tube defects with those of 38 control fetuses who underwent sonography because of an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. Twenty-two of the 23 fetuses with neural tube defects had compression and anterior alignment of the cerebellar hemispheres (the banana sign), and follow-up confirmed the presence of an open neural tube defect. One fetus had a normal-appearing posterior fossa; however, the neural tube defect at birth was completely covered with skin. Four of the neural tube defects were difficult to see sonographically, and the abnormal configuration of the cerebellum, as well as the flattening of the frontal bone (lemon sign), was instrumental in suggesting the correct diagnosis. The 38 control fetuses had normal-appearing posterior fossae.\r"

First, in a laboratory model with four mongrel dogs, RI was found to correlate linearly with cerebral perfusion pressure. Second, RI was studied in 57 healthy neonates and 285 neonates with abnormal clinical or head ultrasound findings. Average RI for healthy newborns was 75 +/- 10 and was inversely related to gestational age. RI in newborns with abnormal findings was uniformly elevated, but these values varied considerably and were not statistically different from normal values. Third, the RI was found to decrease significantly after patent ductus arteriosus ligation, tapping of subdural effusions, ventricular tapping (later cerebrospinal fluid shunting led to a further drop in RI), and ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Elevated RI indicates possible intra- or extracranial abnormality affecting cerebral blood flow. Doppler RI is valuable in following up neonates with abnormal or unstable conditions and in assessing the effectiveness of therapies to improve cerebral perfusion.\r"

Except for the retrolaryngeal portion of the tumor, sonography was valuable in assessing extralaryngeal spread of advanced cancers. It enabled detection of subclinical lymph node metastases in four patients. Furthermore, invasion of the wall of the carotid artery was found in two patients. For evaluating the endolaryngeal and hypopharyngeal portions of the tumor, endoscopy remains mandatory.\r"

A stenosis of at least one main renal artery was identified with intravenous DSRA in 22 patients and confirmed in 20 patients. No significant stenoses were seen with conventional angiography in any of the 64 patients in whom lesions were not seen with intravenous DSRA. Since inadequate DSRA studies were considered positive for renal artery stenosis, the sensitivity of intravenous DSRA was 100% (25 of 25); specificity, 93% (64 of 69); positive predictive value, 83% (25 of 30); and negative predictive value, 100% (64 of 64). The authors conclude that intravenous DSRA is a sensitive test for identifying stenosis of the main renal arteries and is appropriate to use as a screening test among patients at increased risk for renovascular hypertension.\r"

Eight patients with a total of nine pelvic lymphoceles were treated with this method. Eight of the nine lymphoceles (89%) resolved without complications. Four patients had undergone lymphadenectomy and four, renal transplantation. The duration of catheter drainage ranged from 15 to 37 days. Four of the lymphoceles were found to be infected at initial drainage, but this did not alter the amount of time the catheter was left in place. One lymphocele failed to heal with sclerotherapy and required internal drainage. The early results with transcatheter povidone-iodine sclerosis of postoperative lymphoceles are encouraging and warrant further evaluation.\r"

Waveform analysis of the supplying artery documented decreased resistive indices in all cases and increased flow velocities in seven. The peak-systolic flow velocity in the arteries supplying the fistulas ranged from 55 to 180 cm/sec (mean, 92 cm/sec), while the range in normal arteries was 20-52 cm/sec (mean, 32 cm/sec). The resistive indices of the arteries supplying the fistulas ranged from 0.31 to 0.50 (mean, 0.45), while the resistive indices of the normal arteries ranged from 0.60 to 0.92 (mean, 0.74). Arterialization of the venous waveform from the draining vein was also documented in all cases. In six cases, the increased flow velocities resulted in increased color saturation toward white in the supplying artery (n = 2) or in both the artery and the draining vein (n = 4), which was detectable on the realtime image. In six cases, flow turbulence resulted in localized tissue vibration, which appeared as random color assignment in extravascular renal parenchyma adjacent to the fistula. Knowledge of these imaging and Doppler characteristics should aid in the identification of renal transplant arteriovenous fistulas with color Doppler US.\r"

Initial radiologic examination showed two types of hepatic lesions: multiple nodules in both lobes (nodular lesions, n = 2) and large masses with or without calcifications that generally spread along the hepatic margins (diffuse lesions, n = 3). Nodular lesions may be an earlier form of hepatic EHE, as they later gradually changed into the diffuse type. Follow-up CT after treatment showed definite regression of tumors in two cases.

Auxonographic screening on tryptophan-free medium of 28 strains of S. aureus (TSST-1-positive and -negative, Trp+ and Trp-) against Escherichia coli (strains 6094, 7603, and 7877) and other strains of Enterobacteriaceae showed that Trp- S. aureus strains responded only to E. coli and tryptophan. Neither E. coli nor tryptophan inhibited TSST-1 production. Cocultivation of strain FRI1169 or S411 with E. coli strain 7877 showed that TSST-1 production by FRI1169 was not enhanced. In contrast, TSST-1 production by S411 was equal to that of S. aureus alone (less than 640 ng/mL) or enhanced (greater than 12,000 ng/mL) if the input log10 cfu of S. aureus was of equal or greater ratio to input E. coli and if the recovered S. aureus was greater than log10 5 cfu. These results suggest that nutritionally deficient toxicogenic strains of S. aureus may overcome growth limitation by coexisting in dynamic balance with strains of E. coli.\r"

  ".W": "Many cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been associated with Staphylococcus aureus strains that produce in vitro a 22,000-dalton protein called toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1). TSST-1 has been shown to be linked phenotypically to the production of the type II (thiol) staphylococcal protease; however, some strains clearly associated with TSS do not produce TSST-1. With the use of a variety of antibodies to TSST-1, representatives of both TSST-1-positive and TSST-1-negative TSS-associated strains were shown to produce proteins of 32,000, 53,000, and 76,000 daltons that cross-reacted with TSST-1 but that did not appear to be TSST-1 aggregates or to be protein A. TSST-1-negative strains were significantly (P less than .05) more likely than TSST-1-producing strains to produce the type I protease and less likely to produce the type II protease. In vitro the type I (serine) protease digests purified TSST-1. When combinations of type II and type III protease chemical inhibitors were used, the production of the high-molecular-weight cross-reacting proteins during in vitro growth could be selectively enhanced. Since the infected foci (e.g., abscess, vagina) associated with TSS may contain natural protease inhibitors, it is possible that such TSST-1 cross-reacting proteins may be expressed in vivo or that levels of TSST-1 may be increased by an inhibitor of the serine protease.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to detect a possible reporting or diagnostic bias that might have affected the results of previous epidemiologic investigations of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). The methods used in this reassessment of initial findings regarding TSS epidemiology (which were obtained through passive- and active-surveillance systems) included record review and analysis of discharge diagnoses. Results obtained with both the latter methods confirmed the broad outlines of the descriptive epidemiology of TSS. Some recent studies have focused on nonmenstrual cases of TSS and on risk factors for the development of TSS. Key findings include the more frequent isolation from nonmenstrual TSS cases of Staphylococcus aureus strains not producing TSS toxin 1 and a higher case-fatality rate for cases in men and for \"non-vaginal\" cases in women than for vaginal cases (defined as menstrual, postpartum, vaginal nonmenstrual, and contraceptive cases). Studies of the relation between tampon use and TSS suggest that both the degree of absorbency and the chemical composition of the tampon are involved; however, the mechanism by which tampons increase the risk of TSS remains unknown. Contraceptive sponges and diaphragms may be linked to an increased risk of nonmenstrual TSS, whereas oral contraceptives may play a protective role; these possibilities require further study.\r"

Approximately 20% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates produce TSST-1; the production of this toxin is therefore a variable genetic trait. The TSST-1 gene and its flanking sequences are found on a genetic element that is present in TSST-1-positive isolates and absent in TSST-1-negative isolates. Preliminary sequence data and Southern hybridization experiments with the cloned flanking sequences have provided evidence that the TSST-1 element is 4-7 kilobases in size. Hybridization analysis of whole-cell DNA from two genetically mapped TSST-1-positive strains has demonstrated that the TSST-1 element has at least two chromosomal locations. This finding suggests that the element is mobile. Biotyping of 75 TSST-1-positive isolates showed that the large majority were tryptophan-negative, and Southern hybridization analysis of whole-cell DNA from these isolates revealed a common blotting pattern--an observation suggesting that these strains are clonal.\r"

In situ hybridization analysis showed that NCF mRNA peaked in treated cells by 24 hours, whereas unstimulated cells were negative.

Sequestration of infected erythrocytes appears to be critical for survival of the parasite and to mediate immunopathological abnormalities in severe malaria. A leukocyte differentiation antigen (CD36) was previously suggested to have a role in sequestration of malaria-infected erythrocytes. CD36 was purified from platelets, where it is known as GPIV, and was shown to be a receptor for binding of infected erythrocytes. Infected erythrocytes adhered to CD36 immobilized on plastic; purified CD36 exhibited saturable, specific binding to infected erythrocytes; and purified CD36 or antibodies to CD36 inhibited and reversed binding of infected erythrocytes to cultured endothelial cells and melanoma cells in vitro. The portion of the CD36 molecule that reverses cytoadherence may be useful therapeutically for rapid reversal of sequestration in cerebral malaria.\r"

The rapid application of the selective glutamate agonist, quisqualate, activates a large rapidly inactivating current (3 to 8 milliseconds), which is mediated by a neuronal ionic channel with high unitary conductance (35 picosiemens). The current through this channel shows pharmacologic characteristics similar to those observed for the fast excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC); it reverses near 0 millivolts and shows no significant voltage dependence. The amplitude of the current through this channel is many times larger than that through the other non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) channels. These results suggest that this high-conductance quisqualate-activated channel may mediate the fast EPSC in the mammalian central nervous system.\r"

These and other reactions culminate, hours later, in DNA replication and cell division. How does the receptor for PDGF recognize and bind its specific ligand and then transduce this signal across the cell membrane via a single membrane-spanning region? Which of the immediate cellular responses are directly involved in the biochemical pathways that lead to DNA synthesis? How does the PDGF receptor trigger a diverse group of responses?

A model for the formation of H-DNA is proposed, based on two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA's with different lengths of (TC.AG)n copolymers. In this model, H-DNA formation is initiated at a small denaturation bubble in the interior of the copolymer, which allows the duplexes on either side to rotate slightly and to fold back, in order to make the first base triplet. This nucleation establishes which of several nonequivalent H-DNA conformations is to be assumed by any DNA molecule, thereby trapping each molecule in one of several metastable conformers that are not freely interconvertible. Subsequently, the acceptor region spools up single-stranded polypyrimidines as they are released by progressive denaturation of the donor region; both the spooling and the denaturation result in relaxation of negative supercoils in the rest of the DNA molecule. From the model, it can be predicted that the levels of supercoiling of the DNA determine which half of the (dT-dC)n repeat is to become the donated third strand.\r"

Changing cysteine at position 186 to serine in oncogenic forms produces a nonpalmitylated protein that fails to associate with membranes and does not transform NIH 3T3 cells. Nonpalmitylated p21Ras derivatives were constructed that contained myristic acid at their amino termini to determine if a different form of lipid modification could restore either membrane association or transforming activity. An activated p21Ras, altered in this way, exhibited both efficient membrane association and full transforming activity. Surprisingly, myristylated forms of normal cellular Ras were also transforming. This demonstrates that Ras must bind to membranes in order to transmit a signal for transformation, but that either myristate or palmitate can perform this role. However, the normal function of cellular Ras is diverted to transformation by myristate and therefore must be regulated ordinarily by some unique property of palmitate that myristate does not mimic. Myristylation thus represents a novel mechanism by which Ras can become transforming.\r"

The conductance increase gated by NMDA is potentiated by the amino acid glycine, which acts at an allosteric site tightly coupled to the NMDA receptor. Indole-2-carboxylic acid (I2CA) specifically and competitively inhibits the potentiation by glycine of NMDA-gated current. In solutions containing low levels of glycine, I2CA completely blocks the response to NMDA, suggesting that NMDA alone is not sufficient for channel activation. I2CA will be useful for defining the interaction of glycine with NMDA receptors and for determining the in vivo role of glycine in excitotoxicity and synapse stabilization.\r"

Inhibition increased in a concentration-dependent manner over the range 5 to 50 mM, a range that also produces intoxication. The amplitude of the NMDA-activated current was reduced 61 percent by 50 mM EtOH; in contrast, this concentration of EtOH reduced the amplitude of current activated by the glutamate receptor agonists kainate and quisqualate by only 18 and 15 percent, respectively. The potency for inhibition of the NMDA-activated current by several alcohols is linearly related to their intoxicating potency, suggesting that alcohol-induced inhibition of responses to NMDA receptor activation may contribute to the neural and cognitive impairments associated with intoxication.\r"

A major envelope glycoprotein stained in a polar fashion when it was expressed in columnar epithelial cells, but not when expressed in other cells types.

A cell to cell spread within several tissues was detected. These results have important implications for baculoviruses engineered for improving their pesticide potential.\r"

  ".W": "Although there are many complementary and supplementary types of diagnostic imaging of the liver, a logical sequence for most liver pathology begins with high-quality ultrasound. It is noninvasive and inexpensive but very operator dependent. In other settings, CT may be the preferable screening modality, as it gives an excellent picture of the global anatomy and is easily reproducible. Frequently, the two modalities are complementary and indicated; on other occasions, one method will suffice. Radionuclide evaluation of the liver is usually reserved for hepatobiliary imaging for biliary obstruction or the question of acute cholecystitis and tagged-red cell scanning for hemangioma. It is also frequently used for gallium scanning in hepatoma, but lymphoma and inflammatory diseases are also gallium avid. The invasive imaging tests of the liver--angiography and transhepatic and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography--are performed when insufficient information is obtained by the other methods (as in diagnostic transhepatic cholangiography) or when the procedure offers therapy (as for biliary drainage, percutaneous transhepatic removal of common bile duct stones, percutaneous cholecystosis with gallstone dissolution and liver embolization, or the angiographic evaluation for portal shunting or liver resection). The impact of magnetic resonance imaging and fourth-generation raid angiotomography CT scanning has yet to be felt. The use of intraoperative ultrasound is to be encouraged prior to liver resection because it can demonstrate lesions as small as 3 mm in diameter.\r"

Amebic abscesses have a lower mortality rate than pyogenic abscesses. Amebic and pyogenic abscesses can be distinguished on the basis of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory studies. The definitive studies for identifying amebic liver abscesses are hemagglutinin or gel diffusion studies. Amebic abscess of the liver may be complicated by extension to the lung, with pulmonary complications. Patients suspected to have amebic abscesses require metronidazole. Emetine or chloroquine may be added if there is no response or if the abscess recurs. Unless there is a failure of the amebic abscess to resolve or secondary infection occurs, there is seldom a need to aspirate or drain these abscesses. Pyogenic abscesses should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative aerobes and anaerobic organisms. All pyogenic abscesses larger than 1.5 cm in diameter should be aspirated, and the aspirate should be Gram stained and cultured. Percutaneous or surgical drainage should then be performed. Operative intervention is required in those patients with intra-abdominal pyogenic infections that are seeding the liver abscess. The marked reduction in the mortality rate of pyogenic liver abscess witnessed in this decade is multifaceted and attributable in part to earlier diagnosis, permitting definitive treatment in a timely fashion, as well as to improved intensive unit care, antibiotic management, and operative technique.\r"

Signs of blood loss, peritonitis, or peritoneal traverse by a missile prompt early operation in many patients. Stable patients who have suffered stab wounds in proximity to the liver may be safely evaluated by diagnostic peritoneal lavage, whereas CT evaluation is now used in stable patients suffering blunt trauma that may involve the liver. \"Simple\" techniques of repair such as suture hepatorrhaphy, application of topical agents, or application of fibrin glue suffice in 60 per cent (blunt trauma) to 90 per cent (penetrating trauma) of patients with hepatic injuries. The remainder require \"advanced\" techniques of repair such as extensive hepatorrhaphy, hepatotomy with selective vascular ligation, resectional debridement with selective vascular ligation, lobectomy or segmentectomy, selective hepatic artery ligation, or perihepatic packing. Using the techniques described, the mortality rate for all patients with hepatic injuries will be approximately 10 per cent, with 75 to 80 per cent of all deaths occurring in the perioperative period from shock or transfusion-related coagulopathies. The most common major complications in survivors are perihepatic abscesses and postoperative hemorrhage, both of which are frequently treated by the interventional radiologist.\r"

The operative mortality rate of partial hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is about 10 per cent, and median survival after operation is approximately 22 months, with a few long-term cures reported.

For some disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis, the role of transplantation in patient management is obvious. For other hepatic diseases such as primary hepatic neoplasm, clear definition of the role of transplantation is likely to await development of improved early diagnostic techniques and more effective chemotherapy regimens. Standardization of the technical aspects of liver transplant and recent advances in graft preservation have led to reduction in the logistical problems that previously plagued this complex therapy. Refinements in immunosuppression with the introduction of cyclosporine and monoclonal antibody therapy have extended chances for survival and contributed to considerable improvement in quality of life following transplant. Further extension of transplantation as a treatment option to individuals with liver disease will require the concerned effort of the primary care or referral physician in the early recognition and management of patients with liver disease.\r"

Circulation of endotoxins in the blood is an important factor in the pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of endotoxic shock. We have recently developed polymyxin immobilized fiber (PMX-F) as a biomaterial for selectively detoxifying endotoxins. In ex vivo experiments, direct hemoperfusion (DHP) by PMX-F was performed on dogs injected with purified endotoxin. Only one of eight survived in the control group, but ten of 12 survived in the group receiving DHP with PMX-F. Mortality in the treated group decreased remarkably. Thus, the results indicate the efficacy of PMX-F in neutralizing endotoxins. By the same method as already mentioned, DHP with PMX-F was carried out on live dogs with Escherichia coli induced sepsis. All of the dogs in the control group died within 18 hours after bacterial infusion. All of the dogs in the treated group, however, survived for more than three days. Two of the five dogs are still alive. One of the remaining two survived for seven days and the other, 14. We found that PMX-F treatment prolonged or increased the survival rate in the endotoxic and septic dogs.\r"

  ".U": "89187339\r", 
  ".W": "The rapid progress in molecular biology has allowed investigators to define some of the basic mechanisms of carcinogenesis. At the molecular level, cellular transformation results from the occurrence of two or three distinct genetic events that uncouple the cell from its normal regulatory mechanisms. One family of genes, the oncogenes, may be particularly important in the process. The aberrant expression of oncogenes, either by mutation or simply by increased transcription, may result in cellular transformation. The genes usually code for growth factors, growth factor receptors or for proteins involved in the transduction of growth signals into the nucleus. Genetic activation causes the cell to continuously sense a message to undergo mitosis, and the cell no longer responds to its normal regulatory signals. The concepts are rapidly moving into the clinical realm as the genetic mechanisms of particular neoplasms have been investigated. The neuroblastoma is the first tumor system in which the biologic characteristics of the tumor were found to be related to a known oncogene; the amplification of the myc gene is an independent marker of the aggressiveness of the tumor. In addition, much progress has been made in defining the specific genetic lesions responsible for retinoblastomas, Wilms' tumors and carcinomas of the colon that arise in patients with familial polyposis coli. As more knowledge accumulates regarding the exact mechanisms through which the proteins encoded by oncogenes affect these carcinomas and others, it may become possible to design pharmacologic agents rationally to hinder their growth selectively.\r"

  ".W": "The development of vascular clamps requires a reliable method to quantitate clamp-related vascular injuries. The degree of vessel damage usually is estimated subjectively from photomicrographs made with scanning electron microscopy. In order to test whether the use of vascular rings to assess residual vascular function may be a better method, rabbit thoracic aortas were occluded by five types of clamps: a Fogarty softjaw bulldog, a Fogarty Hydragrip, a 6-inch Satinsky clamp, an Edslab bulldog, and a silicone vessel band. Each area of clamp injury was sectioned into a vascular ring and suspended in a tissue bath. Residual vascular function was determined by contraction in response to phenylephrine and by relaxation in response to methacholine chloride and sodium nitroprusside. Morphologic studies with use of Evans blue dye and scanning electron microscopy complemented the vascular-function studies. The Fogarty bulldog clamp was the best at preserving vascular contraction and relaxation; the more crushing Satinsky clamp was the worst. The testing of vascular rings for residual function appears to be a useful technique for objectively quantitating vascular clamp-related vascular damage.\r"

Intraoperative intravenous administration of morphine (0.5 mg/kg) resulted in a reduction in the rate of intussusception to 3.3% (2 of 61 dogs transplanted). Postoperative administration of morphine was ineffective in reducing the incidence of intussusception. The results indicate that intraoperative administration of morphine is effective in preventing postoperative intussusception in dogs used for experimental transplantation and may reduce animal losses and research costs in experimental surgical laboratories.\r"

After removal of the jejunum, glucose intolerance was observed when glucose was administered intraduodenally but not intravenously. Significant decreases were simultaneously observed in the responses of both insulin and GIP 1, 3, and 6 months after the surgery compared with the preoperative controls. The insulin response to intravenous glucose was not altered by removal of the jejunum. The response of GIP to intraduodenal lipid also remained decreased for 6 months after the operation. These results indicate that the GIP deficiency caused by removal of the jejunum may play a role in the poor insulin response to luminal stimuli, which contributes to glucose intolerance.\r"

A 12-fold prolongation of mean cardiac xenograft survival, to 41 days, was accomplished with the combined therapy. In both untreated controls and CsA-treated recipients rejection occurred in 3 days. Splenectomy by itself prolonged xenograft function to 5 days. Evidence of humoral-mediated rejection in this cross-species combination was given for the extensive thrombosis and hemorrhage in the subepicardial area, the appearance of lymphocytotoxic titers just before graft function ceased, and the presence of IgM deposits in subepicardial vessels of the xenograft. CsA by itself could not modify this pattern of rejection. Splenectomy decreased antibody formation significantly and rejection became more cellular in nature. The regimen of splenectomy in association with CsA suppressed antibody titers and produced a CsA dose-dependent prolongation of xenograft survival. Thus, a complementary or synergistic effect is the result of the immunosuppressive regimen of splenectomy and CsA in hamster-to-rat cardiac xenografts. In this study the effect of splenectomy in controlling the humoral response in concordant xenografts and its role in future clinical xenografting is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma exudation is one cardinal factor in airways defence and inflammation. In inflammatory airway diseases such as rhinitis and asthma, however, plasma leakage may also have a pathogenetic role. Experimental data from animals indicate that highly sensitive, active, and reversible processes regulate the vascular and mucosal permeability to macromolecules. With the use of a nasal lavage model for the recovery of liquids on the mucosal surface the effect of histamine on the macromolecular permeability of the airway endothelial-epithelial barriers was studied in normal subjects. The concentrations of albumin, kinins, and N-alpha-beta-tosyl-L-arginine-methyl esterase (TAME) in nasal lavage fluid were measured and nasal symptoms assessed by a scoring technique. The reproducibility of three repeated challenges with 30 minute intervals on the same day was studied in 12 subjects and compared with the same procedure (three challenges) on a different day. Sneezing decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) after the first histamine challenge but was maintained thereafter. Otherwise, the mean values for symptoms and for markers of vascular leakage were very similar both for the three challenges in the same session and for the two challenge sessions on a different day. Sneezing, blockage, and secretions were associated with increased concentrations of TAME esterase (maximum 9000 cpm/ml), kinins (1.4 ng/ml), and albumin (0.3 g/l) in lavage fluid. Both the symptoms and the measures of plasma exudation were reversible and reproducible in the three repeat histamine challenges and at two challenge sessions on different days. These findings support the view that non-injurious, active processes regulate the inflammatory flow of macromolecules across airways endothelial-epithelial barriers. The present experimental approach would be suitable for studies of the modulatory effects of inflammatory stimulus induced plasma leakage and symptoms in human airways.\r"

All 48 had a history of reflux symptoms and 27 had in addition reflux associated respiratory symptoms. Thirty two patients had objective evidence of acid reflux on 24 hour pH monitoring (pH of less than 4 for more than 1% of the 24 hours) and 27 patients had a positive result in the acid perfusion test. Reflux symptoms were significantly improved after ranitidine treatment. Ranitidine treatment was associated with modest improvements in nocturnal asthma and daily use of inhaled bronchodilator drugs but there was no significant change in bronchial reactivity, lung function, peak flow, or the number of eosinophils in the blood. Comparisons between the effect of ranitidine treatment on asthma control were performed between patients with and without a history of reflux associated respiratory symptoms, with and without a positive result in the acid perfusion test, and with and without objective evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux. A history of reflux associated respiratory symptoms was the only factor that predicted an improvement in asthma control after ranitidine treatment. These results indicate that antireflux treatment will produce only small improvements in asthma control in asthmatic patients with a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux.\r"

The effect of the beta 2 agonist salbutamol (200 micrograms by inhalation) on platelet activating factor induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness was studied in seven normal subjects in a double blind, crossover study. Salbutamol only partially inhibited the platelet activating factor induced fall in partial flow at 30% of vital capacity (Vp30) (mean percentage fall 47.6 (SEM 7.9); p less than 0.001), whereas it completely blocked a similar degree of bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine. Salbutamol did not prevent the accompanying transient flushing and chest irritation and did not affect the transient neutropenia (mean % fall 69.5 (13.6); p less than 0.01) or the rebound neutrophilia (mean % increase 84.7 (24.7); p less than 0.05) that followed platelet activating factor. There was an increase in the airway responsiveness to methacholine following inhalation of platelet activating factor, the maximum mean change being a three fold increase in PC40 (the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 40% fall in Vp30) on day 3 (p less than 0.01). Salbutamol caused a significant attenuation of this response on day 3 (p less than 0.02) but had no significant effect on days 1 and 7. Thus a therapeutic dose of salbutamol caused partial inhibition of platelet activating factor induced bronchoconstriction and had a minimal effect on the increased bronchial responsiveness following platelet activating factor.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of inhaled platelet activating factor were compared with those of inhaled methacholine (control) on airway calibre, airway responsiveness to methacholine and isoprenaline, and circulating cells in eight subjects with mild, stable asthma. Platelet activating factor was given in six doses at 15 minute intervals and airway response measured as change in partial expiratory flow at 30% of vital capacity (Vp30). Platelet activating factor caused a fall in Vp30, the mean (SEM) maximum percentage fall being 28.9 (4.2) five minutes after the first dose (12 micrograms) and 50.9 (8.0) after the second dose (24 micrograms). Tachyphylaxis occurred, however, with the four subsequent doses of inhaled platelet activating factor. There was transient neutropenia after the first dose, from a mean of 3.6 (0.2) x 10(9) to 2.2 (0.5) x 10(9) neutrophils/l; this response also showed tachyphylaxis with subsequent doses. The mean PC40 (the concentration of methacholine needed to cause a 40% fall in Vp30) was unchanged one, three, and seven days after administration of platelet activating factor. There was no significant correlation between baseline PC40 methacholine and the maximal fall in Vp30 after either the first (12 micrograms) or the second dose (24 micrograms) of platelet activating factor. The control challenge with methacholine produced a degree of bronchoconstriction similar to that of platelet activating factor but was not associated with any significant change in bronchial responsiveness or in circulating cells. The bronchodilator response to inhaled isoprenaline measured three days after inhalation of platelet activating factor and of methacholine was similar after the two challenges. Thus asthmatic subjects who are hyperresponsive to methacholine show a similar bronchoconstrictor response to platelet activating factor, as has been observed in normal subjects; overall this did not cause airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine.\r"

In this study of airway disease among workers exposed to asbestos and man made mineral fibres, 215 of 246 construction insulators 50 years old or less and currently working in the Montreal area were examined. Spirometry was completed successfully in 214 workers without known asbestosis and 207 underwent methacholine bronchoprovocation testing. Airway responsiveness was expressed as PC15, the concentration of methacholine causing a 15% fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Exposure to asbestos and synthetic mineral fibre dust was estimated from the total hours of work in the trade since first employment. After the effect of age, height, and pack years of smoking had been taken into account, no relation was found between hours of work and any indices obtained from the forced expiratory manoeuvre (FEV1/FVC, MMF). After the effect of airway calibre (FEV1/FVC), age, and pack years of cigarette consumption had been taken into account, airway responsiveness decreased as the total hours of work in the trade increased. These findings suggest that workers with greater levels of airway responsiveness are more sensitive to exposure in a dusty workplace and in consequence are less likely to continue. In studies of workforces a survivor effect of this nature will tend to weaken the relation between lung function abnormality and occupational exposure.\r"

Fifty-five patients (33 men, 22 women) aged 36-81 (mean 62.7) years met entry criteria and agreed to participate. Symptoms prompting hospitalization were referable to the carotid distribution in 43 patients (34 hemispheric, nine retinal); 12 patients had vertebrobasilar distribution TIAs. Twenty-seven patients received heparin and 28 received aspirin. Patients were treated until surgery or until long-term medical therapy was instituted, 3-9 (mean 5.5) days in the heparin group and 3-15 (mean 5.8) days in the aspirin group. Recurrent TIAs occurred in eight patients given heparin and in seven treated with aspirin. Infarction occurred in one patient in the heparin group and in four patients in the aspirin group (three brain, one retinal infarction). Initial symptoms in these five patients were referable to the carotid distribution in two and to the vertebrobasilar distribution in three. All patients but the one with a retinal infarction had recurrent TIAs prior to stroke. Our pilot study suggests that hospitalized patients with recent TIAs are at high risk for recurrent TIAs (15 of 55, 27%) and brain infarction (five of 55, 9%) and that patients with recent vertebrobasilar distribution TIAs have a marginally significantly higher risk (odds ratio 6.83, 95% confidence interval 0.65-88.66) of infarction than patients with recent carotid distribution TIAs.\r"

  ".W": "Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ have been implicated as having roles in the pathomechanisms of cerebral ischemia. To further study the effects of these ions on postischemic histologic outcome, fasted rats were given one of three intravenous infusions: 5.0 mmol/kg MgCl2, 5.0 mmol/kg MgCl2 + 0.035 units/kg regular insulin, or 1.0 mmol/kg CaCl2. This resulted in elevated plasma Mg2+ or Ca2+ concentrations in the corresponding groups. A fourth group received 0.9% NaCl (saline). Preinfusion plasma glucose concentration was similar for all groups and was unchanged after infusion in rats receiving either saline or MgCl2 + insulin. In contrast, postinfusion glucose concentration was increased in the MgCl2 group (p less than 0.001) and decreased in the CaCl2 group (p less than 0.001) relative to saline-treated rats. Following respective infusions, all rats underwent 10 minutes of reversible forebrain ischemia (bilateral carotid artery occlusion and systemic hypotension) followed by 7 days' recovery. Six of 12 CaCl2-treated rats died 2-3 days after ischemia; all other rats remained neurologically indistinguishable, without gross neurologic deficits. Histologic injury in the neocortex and caudate was moderate in all groups. In the hippocampus, MgCl2 + insulin resulted in 66 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD) dead CA1 pyramidal cells, which was similar to the amount in saline-treated rats (68 +/- 10%). Injury was increased in the MgCl2 group (79 +/- 4% dead cells), while in surviving CaCl2-treated rats, injury was decreased (54 +/- 13%). We conclude that the increased injury in MgCl2-treated rats and the decreased injury noted in surviving rats receiving CaCl2 are due to the plasma glucose concentrations present prior to ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Familial posterior urethral valves have been reported before in both twin and non-twin siblings. The occurrence of identical pathology in non-twin siblings suggests the possibility of an inherited trait as does its occurrence in identical twins. However, non-identical clinical manifestation is as common as is identical presentation in both groups. There are also instances of discordance in monozygotic twins suggesting the possibility of a random mutation. As such, we recommend urologic evaluation of the male siblings of affected patients with posterior urethral valves. Further prospective and retrospective analyses are needed to define the genetic etiology of valves.\r"

We examined 47 patients ultrasonographically. Of these, 34 underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (ultrasonographic volume 29 patients: prostate less than 60 cm3, 5 patients with cardiovascular problems: prostate greater than 60 cm3) and 13 an open prostatectomy according to Hryntschak (prostate greater than 60 cm3). In all patients ultrasonically determined volumes were compared with the operatively removed volume of prostatic tissue. If the size of the prostate had been estimated by digital palpation only, 12 patients would have undergone the wrong procedure (TURP instead of Hryntschack procedure). Ultrasonographic calculation of the prostatic volume demonstrated that all of these patients could be treated with less risk. After resection or abdominal prostatectomy some prostatic tissue remains. We concluded that there is no clear difference in the incidence of secondary prostatic obstruction (in need of re-TURP) either after abdominal prostatectomy or after TURP.\r"

Although documented rupture occurred in only 14 cases (1.7%), it accounted for 14% of in-hospital mortality. Seven of the 14 ruptures occurred within 2 days and 10 within 4 days of the MB-creatine kinase-determined onset of infarction. Three easily determined baseline characteristics defined a set of patients with a markedly increased risk of myocardial rupture. Rupture was 9.2 times more likely to occur in patients with all of the following characteristics than in the remaining patients: (1) no history of previous angina or myocardial infarction, (2) ST segment elevation or signs of Q wave development on the initial ECG, and (3) peak MB-creatine kinase value (greater than or equal to 150 IU/L). The risk of myocardial rupture with these three characteristics was 5.5%. Although these predictors are likely to be of little therapeutic value for free wall rupture, since most patients with that complication die within minutes of its onset, they may aid in alerting physicians to the early diagnosis and timely surgical correction of ventricular septal rupture.\r"

Adult patients with supine diastolic blood pressure ranging from 95 to 120 mm Hg were eligible to enter this double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Analyses of the blood pressure data from the 194 evaluable patients revealed that all three treatments produced significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures from baseline values. Moreover, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater mean blood pressure reductions than were observed with either drug used as monotherapy. In the group receiving terazosin monotherapy, the total serum cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein plus very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction, and triglyceride level fell significantly (median changes of 3.7%, 5.0%, and 16.3%, respectively, p less than 0.05). However, in the group receiving MCTZ monotherapy, the total serum cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein plus very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction, and triglyceride level increased significantly (4.7%, 7.1%, and 12.5%, respectively, p less than 0.001). In contrast, no significant changes from baseline values were observed for any lipid variable in the group receiving terazosin/MCTZ combination therapy. We conclude that terazosin is effective antihypertensive therapy that has a potentially beneficial effect on the serum lipid profile when used as monotherapy and that it counteracts the negative impact of MCTZ monotherapy on the serum lipid profile when used concurrently with this thiazide diuretic.\r"

  ".W": "Although Q wave and non-Q wave MI are often referred to as \"transmural\" and \"nontransmural,\" there is no anatomic evidence to justify this distinction. Nevertheless, a distinction is important, because the two entities have a different prognosis. At the present time, between 25% and 35% of MIs are non-Q wave. They are frequently observed in patients with previous coronary events. They occur in a relatively older population and involve a slightly higher proportion of women than do Q wave MIs. The degree of cardiac damage is less, reflected by a smaller rise in enzyme level and less impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction; early reperfusion may occur, after spontaneous thrombolysis or resolution of coronary spasm. The immediate mortality rate is half that of Q wave MI but identical in the long term. Reinfarction and angina are more frequent because of a peri-infarction zone of ischemia maintained by a high-grade coronary stenosis and inadequate collateral circulation. Early characterization of those MIs likely to progress is important. Diltiazem seems effective in this context if given between 24 and 72 hours of the onset of the event. Other therapeutic approaches need further assessment.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacologic therapy of mild primary hypertension (diastolic blood pressure less than 105 mm Hg) has effectively reduced hypertensive arteriolar end organ disease such as cerebrovascular accidents, congestive heart failure, and nephropathy, but there has been no convincing evidence that coronary heart disease (CHD) or its complications, acute myocardial infarction or angina, have been reduced. The risks of therapy with certain antihypertensive drugs may outweigh their treatment benefits as it relates to CHD. The optimal treatment strategy should be to reduce all CHD risk factors, reverse the hemodynamic abnormalities present by lowering the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), preserving cardiac output (CO) and perfusion, and to select the best antihypertensive drug for concomitant medical diseases or problems while maintaining a good quality of life. Antihypertensive drugs that have favorable or neutral effects on CHD risk factors include alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, central alpha agonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. On the other hand, diuretics and beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have unfavorable effects on many CHD risk factors. Baseline and serial evaluation of the effects of these drugs on serum lipids, lipid subfractions, glucose, uric acid, electrolytes, exercise tolerance, left ventricular hypertrophy, blood pressure, SVR, CO, perfusion, concomitant diseases, and side effects is necessary to evaluate overall cardiovascular risk.\r"

These patients were evaluated for acute chest pain in the emergency departments of 7 hospitals. The same features were associated with increased relative risks for AMI in younger and elderly patients. The relative risks among older patients, however, were consistently closer to 1.0 for classic features, including male gender, pressure-like quality of pain, substernal location, typical pattern of pain radiation and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia or AMI. Analyses for the endpoint \"acute ischemic heart disease\" (i.e., AMI or unstable angina) yielded similar findings. Elderly patients were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (56 vs 35%; p less than 0.0001) and to the coronary care unit (37 vs 23%; p less than 0.0001) in the absence of either AMI or unstable angina. These data support the hypothesis that diagnosis of acute chest pain is especially difficult in elderly patients.\r"

Patients recorded each episode of AF in a diary and recorded a simultaneous electrocardiographic rhythm strip by means of a transtelephonic recorder and transmitter to validate the presence of AF.

After a 1-week run-in period, all patients were examined: blood pressure was measured and electrocardiograms and 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms were obtained. Two thirds of the patients (n = 147) were then randomized to receive ketanserin for 1 week (20 mg twice daily) followed by 3 weeks of 40 mg twice daily; one third of the patients (n = 74) received placebo (twice daily) for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, blood pressure, electrocardiograms and 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms were repeated. In hypertensive patients, ketanserin significantly reduced systolic (mean reduction 17 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (12 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) compared to baseline, and to the placebo group (p less than 0.005 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure).

Plasma lipids and lipoproteins were also assessed at baseline, during placebo and after randomization to active therapy in a subgroup of patients. Compared with placebo, celiprolol reduced supine and standing BP (reduction of supine BP -0.4/-2.1 mm Hg with placebo, -5.7/-6.4 with celiprolol, p less than 0.05; reduction of standing BP -1.7/-1.0 with placebo, -7.2/-4.9 with celiprolol, p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The determinants of myocardial salvage after thrombolytic therapy during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have not been clearly defined. In 1984, a prospective randomized trial was undertaken to define the relations between delay to treatment and effectiveness of perfusion to salvage of myocardium. Patients presenting within 2 hours of symptom onset received intravenous streptokinase immediately (group 1, 20 patients) or 5 hours after symptom onset (group 2, 16 patients). Effective perfusion (less than or equal to 90% residual stenosis with rapid distal runoff) occurred in 63% of patients in both groups. Five patients, all in group 1, had recurrent AMI; 4 of the 5 had effective perfusion. There was no group difference in left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline or before discharge. However, group 1 patients with effective perfusion tended to have a greater predischarge mean ejection fraction than those in group 1 with ineffective perfusion (53 +/- 13 vs 44 +/- 16%, p less than 0.10) and had a greater mean value than those in group 2 with ineffective perfusion (53 +/- 13 vs 38 +/- 17%, p less than 0.03). The ejection fraction did not change significantly between admission and discharge in either group, but it increased significantly in group 1 patients with effective perfusion and no recurrent AMI (delta EF = +6 +/- 8%, p less than 0.04). Group 1 patients with ineffective perfusion had a significant decrease in ejection fraction (delta EF = -4 +/- 4%, p less than 0.04). In group 2 patients the ejection fraction did not change, regardless of the state of perfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomized to ASA or placebo less than 12 hours after onset of symptoms. Heparin, 5,000 IU subcutaneously twice daily, was given to all patients during immobilization. Echocardiography was performed less than 24 hours, 48 to 72 hours and 1, 2, and 12 weeks after AMI. LV thrombosis was detected by echocardiography in 30 (33%) of the 92 evaluable patients (15 patients given ASA and 15 given placebo). Indium-111 platelet scintigraphy was done in 17 of the 22 patients with an LV thrombus at the second week echocardiogram. Among 7 ASA-treated patients, 4 had positive images; among 10 placebo patients, 5 had positive images. LV thrombus resolution was noted in 3 of 9 patients with a positive scan and in 5 of 8 patients with a negative platelet scan. In 7 of 10 ASA-treated patients and 5 of 12 placebo-treated patients thrombus resolution was observed (difference not significant). Systemic embolism occurred in 2 patients, both given ASA, during the first week after AMI. Thus, low dose ASA has no effect on the incidence, hematologic activity and embolic potential of LV thrombosis in anterior wall AMI.\r"

Patients with either new onset (less than 48 hours, n = 31) or old onset (greater than 48 hours, n = 14) of atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular rate were stratified to receive esmolol (n = 21) or verapamil (n = 24). Drug efficacy was measured by ventricular rate reduction and conversion to sinus rhythm. The heart rate declined with esmolol from 139 to 100 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and with verapamil from 142 to 97 beats/min (p less than 0.001). Fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted (p less than 0.03). Mild hypotension was observed in both treatment groups. Esmolol compares favorably with verapamil with respect to both efficacy and safety in acutely decreasing ventricular response during atrial fibrillation or flutter. Moreover, conversion to sinus rhythm is significantly more likely with esmolol.\r"

Both medications controlled blood pressure (BP) to a similar degree (mean BP was 150 +/- 12, 137 +/- 17 and 141 +/- 14 mm Hg for placebo, atenolol and doxazosin, respectively) but by different mechanisms. Changes during maximal semierect bicycle exercise were similar to those seen at rest. Doxazosin decreased total peripheral resistance and maintained cardiac output, whereas atenolol decreased cardiac output. Exercise capacity (136 +/- 56 watts with placebo) was maintained by doxazosin (135 +/- 56 watts) but decreased with atenolol (122 +/- 55 watts). Compared with atenolol, doxazosin slightly increased the left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and during exercise. The significance of this study is in the choice of a first-line antihypertensive agent. Both are once-a-day medications that control BP. However, doxazosin does so by improving the abnormal physiology of essential hypertension and, consequently, does not adversely affect exercise performance.\r"

  ".W": "A familial etiology was identified on the basis of family history in 16 (8.75%) of 184 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation at Stanford for endstage dilated cardiomyopathy (DC). These 16 patients, from 11 families, included 5 sibling pairs. To help determine optimal management of such patients, their case histories and posttransplant courses were reviewed. Mean age of patients at presentation was 23 +/- 15 years. In sibling pairs, duration of symptoms from onset to diagnosis was 14 +/- 5 weeks for the first sibling, but only 4 +/- 2 weeks for the second. Progressive cardiac enlargement was documented radiographically in siblings of transplant recipients in 2 families before the onset of symptoms. The posttransplant course with regard to rejection incidence, infectious complications, coronary artery disease and malignancy was similar to that of the 168 patients with nonfamilial DC. Actuarial survival at 5 years after transplantation was 80%. Thirteen patients (including all sibling pairs) are alive 1 to 11 years after transplantation. Sepsis was the cause of death in 3 patients, occurring during the early postoperative period in 2 and following retransplantation for graft atherosclerosis 7 years after the initial transplant in the third patient. Thus, diagnosis of DC in childhood or adolescence mandates evaluation and surveillance of family members, because this disease can progress rapidly. The favorable results of cardiac transplantation for familial DC suggest that it should be promptly considered for such patients with end-stage disease.\r"

Forty-six percent of the 4.3-kg average weight gain experienced by these subjects consisted of lean body mass (LBM) and it is of interest that there were also increases in plasma Somatomedin-C/Insulin-like Growth Factor (SM-C/IGF-1) and testosterone concentrations as well as insulin. We suggest that it was the combined anabolic effect of these three hormones that facilitated the increase in LBM. Of the other assays done, increases were recorded for urinary 17-ketosteroids, 17-hydroxysteroids, epinephrine, and creatinine, whereas there were no changes in serum cortisol or triiodothyronine (T3), or urine norepinephrine; serum thyroxine (T4) fell slightly. Thus it appears that energy surfeit as well as energy deficit (reported by others) has an effect on blood hormone concentrations.\r"

Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and the rate of carbohydrate oxidation were significantly greater with fructose (12.4 +/- 0.6% and 54.8 +/- 2.1 g/6 h, respectively) than with glucose (10.7 +/- 0.7%, p less than 0.01, and 48.3 +/- 2.4 g/6 h, p less than 0.01, respectively).

When fructose provides the only carbohydrate source of a mixed meal, it induces a larger increase in carbohydrate oxidation and thermogenesis than when glucose is the carbohydrate source.\r"

Of these, the amelioration of lactose intolerance symptoms in humans and rats due to the reduced lactose level caused by fermentation is convincingly documented and corroborated. In addition, some kinds of fermentation microbes can contribute to lactose digestion in vivo thus augmenting the preingestive fermentative decrease of lactose. Relief of the growth inhibition and the gastrointestinal infection susceptibility due to high dietary lactose levels can also be achieved by fermentation of milk lactose. The hypocholesterolemic activity of fermented milk is apparently related to a similar uncharacterized activity of ordinary milk. Antitumorigenic effects in rats have been reported. Microfloral alterations due to dietary dairy microbes have been reported to retard the development of colon cancer. Purported human longevity effects have not been supported by appropriate data.\r"

All subjects were given 75 g glucose orally; serial blood and urine samples were collected for Cr analysis. Lean control subjects had significantly lower plasma Cr and insulin values than did obese control subjects at all times except zero (1 h, 12.69 +/- 6.73 vs 22.31 +/- 13.27 nmol/L, p less than 0.020). No significant differences were seen between lean and obese NIDDs and IDDs. NIDDs taking drugs had higher Cr values than did lean control subjects (13.08 +/- 0.58 vs 22.31 +/- 5.00 nmol/L, p less than 0.02). Cr concentration of oral drugs was 22.4 ng/tablet and of the soluble insulins was 0.012 +/- .003 ng/U. The lean IDDs excreted higher levels of Cr than did the control subjects; however, Cr excretion within individual groups was not found to be significantly different. The results suggest Cr metabolism is influenced by BMI in control subjects but not in diabetics.\r"

Liver biopsy samples taken at surgery were directly analyzed for vitamin A. The correlation coefficient between calculated and measured liver vitamin A concentrations for 10 of the subjects was 0.88, and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.95 (p less than 0.002).

Material constituting the spherules stained intensely for type IV collagen, and its ultrastructure was similar to that of basement-membrane material.

With the use of a fluorescent antibody to a human nuclear proliferation antigen, Ki-67, and flow cytometry, mixed lymphocyte cultures on 20 families of renal and bone marrow transplant patients and normal controls were performed. In this method for measuring lymphocytic proliferation, previously developed by the authors, the entire culture and staining procedures are performed in microculture plates. Finally, the cell suspensions are aspirated with a microsampler to be analyzed by a flow cytometer. Excellent correlation of the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells and the counts per minute (CPM) of 3H-TdR incorporated into the DNA was obtained. This method eliminates the use of radioactive labels, is less time consuming, and yields results two to three days earlier than the radioactive method. In addition, the authors dual-labeled the lymphocyte nuclei with Ki-67 and propidium iodide (Ki-67/PI). This permitted the comparison of the appearance of nuclear antigen with the various phases of the cell cycle.\r"

  ".W": "A high incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has been reported in children and young adults previously afflicted with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The authors have studied the effect of rubella virus infection on human pancreatic islet cells in tissue culture. These experiments were performed with the use of both monolayers and free-floating human fetal islets of Langerhans tissue. Levels of production of immunoreactive insulin by islet cells that had been infected by rubella virus were lower than those observed in control cultures, under conditions of high glucose concentration (11.1 mmol/L) in the medium. The presence of rubella viral antigens in human pancreatic beta and non-beta cells was demonstrated by double-label immunofluorescence. These results suggest that rubella virus can infect human pancreatic islet cells and that such infection may lead to significant reductions in levels of secreted insulin.\r"

The immunohistochemistry of biopsy specimens pointed to a diagnosis of carcinoma, the tumor cells being cytokeratin positive and leukocyte common antigen (LCA) negative. After resection, however, histopathologic results showed that the tumor was a large cell lymphoma with plasmablastic differentiation. A new immunohistologic study confirmed, on the one hand, the diagnosis of lymphoma with its monotypic character IgA kappa and, on the other, positivity with three different cytokeratins of the lymphoma cells and their negativity with LCA. The aberrant immunophenotyping of this lymphoma is exceptional and must not undermine the recognized usefulness of LCA and cytokeratin, which both are basic antibody markers of immunohistochemistry in undifferentiated malignant neoplasms.\r"

This new technology is based on biosensors, analytic microelectronic devices that use biologic detector molecules (e.g., antibodies, enzymes, receptor proteins, lectins, nucleic acids) as the sensing or signal transducing elements. An array of different biosensor configurations are under development, spurred on by recent advances in biotechnology and solid-state electronics. Although not all biosensors can detect their target analytes instantaneously, nor perform continuous measurements, certain biosensors embody both capabilities. Real-time, on-line biochemical monitoring will offer important information heretofore unavailable to the physician. It is also inevitable that biosensor-based instruments will decentralize patient testing, but telemetric systems can maintain the active and necessary involvement of the clinical pathologist.\r"

They were believed to represent the remains of the \"Princes in the Tower\" (who had disappeared in 1483), and were reinterred as such in Westminster Abbey. Popular belief and conventional historical tradition held that the princes had been murdered by their uncle, King Richard III, to clear his path to the throne. In 1933, the bones in the Abbey were disinterred and examined, with the conclusion that they were indeed those of the princes. One skull was also thought to show evidence of death by suffocation, supporting another feature of popular legend. Later reviews of the investigation, however, revealed significant errors and omissions. This report summarizes the inconsistencies present in the scientific record and suggests that reexamination of the remains with improved techniques in both carbon dating and forensic science would provide a much more accurate analysis, thus helping to clarify the historical record.\r"

  ".W": "We obtained a sample of serum and mucosal biopsies from the antrum and usually from the corpus of the stomach from 35 symptomatic patients during routine endoscopy to analyze for the relationship between Campylobacter pylori infection, inflammation, and the diagnostic utility of a C. pylori IgG antibody assay. C. pylori was identified prospectively by culture and/or silver stain in gastric biopsies from 24 patients, and the antibody was detected in 19 (79%) of these patients. The antibody assay was positive in three other patients, two of whom had C. pylori, on reexamination of their biopsies. The accuracy of the antibody assay was 83%. Inflammation was detected in all C. pylori-positive antral biopsies (N = 19). However, five (71%) of seven antral biopsies from patients in whom all tests were C. pylori negative, also had inflammation, constituting 17% of all patients with antral gastritis (N = 30). Both antral and fundic mucosa were obtained from 26 patients and, in this group, C. pylori was detected in fundic mucosa from all patients in whom the organism also was present in the antrum (N = 15). In significant (p less than 0.001) contrast to C. pylori-positive antral histology, fundic mucosal histology was normal in 6 (40%) of 15 C. pylori-positive biopsies, all from patients with peptic ulcer disease. We conclude that C. pylori antibody assays will be useful for epidemiological studies and initial screening of the C. pylori status of individual patients. In addition, there is a high concordance rate between antral and fundic mucosa for the prevalence of C. pylori, but in contrast to the probable etiological role of C. pylori in antral gastritis, the organism appears to be only a commensal of fundic mucosa. Moreover, C. pylori infection is not evident in all patients with type B gastritis.\r"

Sigmoidoscopy was performed 4 wk after treatment to determine the adequacy of polyp eradication. In the fixed duration cautery group, 11 of 21 polyps (52%) were eradicated, compared with 12 of 14 polyps (86%) in the variable duration cautery group (p = 0.04). When analyzed according to whether or not visible necrosis was achieved (some of the polyps in the fixed duration cautery group showed necrosis with 2 s cautery), 19 of 23 polyps (83%) were eradicated when necrosis was evident, compared to 5 of 12 (42%) without necrosis (p = 0.004). We conclude that hot biopsy treatment for diminutive polyps is significantly more effective when visible necrosis is achieved during cautery. Furthermore, even with visible necrosis, there is a 17% failure rate of polyp eradication.\r"

RESULTS: In the 13 patients without tricuspid regurgitation, there was excellent agreement between the results of thermodilution and Fick or indocyanine green dye cardiac output determinations (4.95 +/- 1.19 liters/minute by thermodilution, 4.90 +/- 1.11 liters/minute by Fick or indocyanine green dye; NS). In contrast, in the 17 patients with tricuspid regurgitation, the results of thermodilution were consistently lower than those of Fick or indocyanine green dye (4.22 +/- 1.45 liters/minute by thermodilution, 4.99 +/- 1.67 liters/minute by Fick or indocyanine green dye; p less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Thus, the thermodilution technique of measuring cardiac output is inaccurate in patients with tricuspid regurgitation, yielding results that are consistently lower than the actual outputs.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Short-term therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension is effective and well tolerated, and compared with beta blockers, may cause fewer adverse reactions. Furthermore, enalapril has been observed to have a greater effect on systolic blood pressure than beta blockers. We therefore decided to compare the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the beta blocker atenolol as monotherapy in a double-blind study of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a four-week placebo run-in period, 162 patients were allocated randomly to receive atenolol (50 to 100 mg daily) or enalapril (20 to 40 mg daily) for 12 weeks. To assess the influence of these drugs on quality of life, a series of psychologic tests was performed, and a subset of patients also underwent treadmill exercise and pulmonary function tests. RESULTS: In 147 patients who completed the study, enalapril reduced supine blood pressure by 19/12 mm Hg, compared with 9/7 mm Hg for atenolol (p less than 0.001/p less than 0.005). The modest blood pressure response to atenolol was not due to poor compliance. A target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or less was achieved by 35 percent of enalapril-treated atenolol (p less than 0.01). The frequency and severity of adverse effects with the two drugs were similar, and few important differences emerged from the quality-of-life assessments. CONCLUSION: At the doses used, enalapril induced a greater short-term blood pressure response than atenolol; long-term studies of its safety and efficacy are required.\r"

The analysis disclosed multiple errors in cognition and produced a provisional classification of these errors based on a framework derived from cognitive science. Faults in cognition were identified in all steps of the diagnostic process, including triggering, context formulation, information gathering and processing, and verification. We instantiated each type of error by providing detailed specific examples, and identified the consequences of each error. We conclude that cognitive errors can be identified and classified, that they can produce serious morbidity, and that a classification of cognitive errors is a step toward a deeper understanding of the epidemiology, causes, and prevention of diagnostic errors.\r"

Results indicate that local prostaglandin E2 is superior to placebo or no therapy in enhancing cervical effacement and dilation, reducing initial induction failures, shortening the induction-delivery interval, reducing oxytocin use, and lowering the rate of cesarean section because of failure to progress. Certain advantages also exist for labor induction in the presence of a favorable cervical state. Uterine hyperstimulation or pathologic fetal heart rate patterns before oxytocin administration occur in less than 1% of reported cases and are usually dose related, self contained, and reversible with the use of beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy. Maternal systemic effects in these low doses are negligible. Worldwide clinical experience has clearly demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 gel administered before induction of labor is of major therapeutic benefit and should become commercially available for more than investigational use.\r"

Requirements for study entry included a gestational age less than 32 completed weeks and an amniotic fluid greater than 10 cm in one or both sacs. The amniotic fluid was measured using real-time ultrasonography before, during, and after treatment. Indomethacin treatment was initiated as a 100 mg rectal suppository and maintained thereafter by 50 mg orally every 6 hours. Treatment was discontinued after 32 completed weeks' gestation, if the patient was asymptomatic and the amniotic fluid was \"normal\" (less than 8 cm) or after the onset of oligohydramnios in one or both sacs (less than 2 cm). The interval from initiation of treatment to delivery ranged from 12 to 101 days. A coincidental reduction in amniotic fluid was observed in all seven treatment cycles. The time interval to obtain \"normal\" fluid ranged from 4 to 20 days (mean, 12.5 days). There were no perinatal complications attributable to indomethacin treatment. These data suggest that in selected pregnancies complicated by hydramnios, indomethacin may be of value not only in prolonging gestation but also in amniotic fluid reduction.\r"

For purposes of the study the antenatal categorization of chorionic type was based only on the number of layers observed. The pregnancy was classified as monochorionic when only two layers were identified and as dichorionic if three or four layers were seen. Confirmation of chorionic type was obtained after delivery by histopathologic examination of the placenta. The ultrasonographic technique used correctly determined chorionicity in 68 of 69 twin pregnancies. The predictive accuracy was 100% for 51 pregnancies designated by ultrasonography as dichorionic and 94.4% for 18 pregnancies considered to be monochorionic. These results suggest that counting the number of layers seen in fetal membranes by ultrasonography examination is an accurate way of determining chorionicity in twin gestation.\r"

This method was then applied in the second phase of the study to 180 high-risk pregnancies to examine correlation with perinatal outcome variables. The relationship between results of the last total score and perinatal outcome variables shows good predictive values. Results of this preliminary study suggest that real-time ultrasonographic evaluation-based scoring of acute fetal events, namely, movements and breathing alone, may have an important role in perinatal management.\r"

  ".W": "The recently developed enzyme immunoassay for estrogen receptors is more simple to perform with quality assurance than conventional steroid-binding assays with radioactive labeled estrogen. However, it is not known how well the results of the two assays agree for normal human uterine samples. We compared enzyme immunoassay (Abbott estrogen receptor enzyme immunoassay) and steroid-binding assay of normal human endometrium and myometrium. Low-salt, \"cytosol\" estrogen receptor determinations were performed by dextran-coated charcoal assay, and high-salt, \"nuclear\" estrogen receptors were measured by controlled pore glass bead assay. Results showed excellent correlation (p less than 0.0001) for cytosol estrogen receptor of endometrium (r = 0.95) and myometrium (r = 0.79) and also for a smaller number of nuclear estrogen receptors of myometrium (p less than 0.01, r = 0.69). Good agreement between steroid-binding assay and enzyme immunoassay was seen for estrogen receptors of both proliferative and secretory phase samples. Thus the data indicate that the simpler estrogen receptor enzyme immunoassay is useful to measure estrogen receptor in the normal uterus. Furthermore, with this sandwich assay, there is no evidence for the existence of significant quantities of receptor fragments that do not bind estrogen.\r"

All patients had documentation of an elevated CA 125 level (greater than 35 U/ml) at a time when ovarian cancer was present, and thus the tumors were known to be \"marker positive.\" Operation was performed in 45 patients who were clinically free of disease and in 51 patients in whom there was clinical evidence of disease. At the time of operation, 29 patients had normal CA 125 levels; persistent disease was documented in 18 (62%) of these. Of the patients with normal CA 125 levels at the time of operation, those with persistent disease had a significantly higher mean CA 125 level (16.9) than those with no disease detected (8.8, p = 0.001). At exploration, cancer was found in 84 patients. There was a correlation between the maximum diameter of the largest residual tumor mass and the accuracy of the CA 125 level as follows: microscopic to 1 cm disease, 55% accuracy; greater than 1 to 5 cm disease, 80% accuracy; greater than 5 cm disease, 92% accuracy (p = 0.013). There was no correlation of CA 125 accuracy with the patient's age, number of months from initial diagnosis, tumor stage, grade, or cell type, or the highest-ever level of CA 125. Of the 84 patients with tumor found at exploration, 66 had elevated CA 125 levels, yielding a sensitivity of 78.5%. There were 12 patients with no tumor found at exploration; 11 of these had normal CA 125 levels. The one patient who had an elevated CA 125 level subsequently had a recurrence; the corrected specificity is thus 100%. An elevated CA 125 level is an accurate predictor of persistent disease. Most of these patients will have gross tumor present. The accuracy of the CA 125 level in detecting disease is related to the amount of tumor present. In our population, the predictive value of an elevated CA 125 level was 100%; the predictive value of a normal CA 125 level was 38%.\r"

Other alterations in calcium and magnesium metabolism, as reflected by increased urinary calcium excretion and serum magnesium levels, may also contribute to this effect. Subgroups of study participants with initial (less than 26 weeks' gestation) low levels of serum calcium and plasma renin activity are the ones with the largest reductions in blood pressure. Whether these alterations can produce a reduction in the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension is the next question to be answered in this area.\r"

Aerobic training was performed on a bicycle ergometer. Both groups were monitored throughout pregnancy by frequent gynecologic examinations. During labor, both groups of women had pain perception assessment. Blood was sampled for levels of beta-endorphin, cortisol, human growth hormone, and prolactin. Plasma beta-endorphin was found elevated compared to controls in patients who exercised throughout pregnancy. This difference was maintained throughout labor and pain perception during labor was reduced in the patients who exercised. Cortisol, human growth hormone, and prolactin levels were lowered during labor for the exercise-conditioned patients. Exercise conditioning during pregnancy seems to be beneficial in reducing pain perception during labor (as determined by measurement of visual analog pain scales) and in reducing stress levels during labor.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the involvement of fibronectin in the early development of mouse embryo, embryos at the two-cell stage were cultured in serum-free Ham F-10 medium with or without fibronectin-related substances. When antibody raised against fibronectin was added at concentrations of 0, 10(-3), 10(-2), and 2 X 10(-2) (vol:vol), the percentages of cells in the blastocyst stage at 72 hours were 88.5%, 67.2%, 48.1%, and 0%, respectively. No inhibitory effects were observed with nonspecific antibody. A low concentration of exogenous fibronectin (up to 0.2 mumol/L) slightly enhanced mouse embryo development after 48 hours. However, a higher concentration (greater than 0.4 mumol/L) of fibronectin inhibited mouse embryo development. A competitive blocker of cell membrane fibronectin receptors, oligopeptide (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser), inhibited mouse embryo development in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, control peptide (Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro), which does not contain the crucial cell binding sequence, did not show any inhibitory effects. These findings suggest the necessity of endogenous fibronectin-blastomere interaction in early mouse embryo development.\r"

  ".W": "The length of time required to achieve hemostasis after ligation of blood vessels with a diameter of 1.0 to 3.5 mm was studied. Canine limb vessels were ligated with stainless steel clips. These were removed at 48, 60, 72, 84, or 96 hours after ligation, and the degree of hemostasis was evaluated by observing the effect of varying amounts of trauma applied to the vessels. The vessels were first observed for 1 minute. In the second phase the vessels were stroked for 15 seconds and then observed for 1 minute. In the second phase the vessels were stroked for 15 seconds and then observed for any bleeding. An additional 15 seconds of stroking followed by observation completed the evaluation. All blood vessels achieved hemostasis after 96 hours of secure ligation despite the trauma. All ligating devices must provide secure ligation to achieve hemostasis for at least 96 hours. The presence of disease processes or medications interfering with clotting would necessitate a longer period of secure ligation to achieve hemostasis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the response of the sympathoadrenal system in fetal sheep receiving exogenous insulin infusion, we measured plasma catecholamine levels in 14 chronically catheterized fetal sheep before and during an infusion of insulin for 2 days. Catecholamine values were measured in fetal arterial plasma by an electrochemical detection method. Fetal plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations increased significantly during insulin infusion. Significant inverse correlations were observed between the log norepinephrine concentration and fetal arterial oxygen content and glucose values. A significant direct correlation between the log norepinephrine concentration and fetal arterial carbon dioxide concentration was also observed. The log epinephrine concentration correlated inversely with plasma glucose concentration. Increases in fetal heart rate during both the noninfused and insulin-infused states correlated significantly with increases in norepinephrine concentration. We conclude that the sympathoadrenal system is activated during fetal insulin infusion, potentially supporting some of the fetal cardiovascular responses to insulin infusion.\r"

The relaxing incisions had all been placed based on visual inspection of keratoscope mires alone. Computer analysis of keratoscope photographs showed considerable individual variation in the degree of surface irregularity in preoperative topography. Our data suggest that the steep axis of the postkeratoplasty graft is better conceptualized as two steep hemimeridians. These hemimeridians were separated by an angle other than 180 degrees (two of six cases), and often showed fairly large changes in power from the most central to peripheral areas of the graft analyzed (three of six cases). Asymmetry of power between the two steep hemimeridians was seen in all cases. Areas of maximum steepening were often present in the peripheral portions of the graft in areas other than the major hemimeridians. Individual variation in preoperative corneal irregularity and asymmetry appeared to have an effect on the success of the relaxing incisions.\r"
