  ".W": "A glycoprotein, termed amphiregulin (AR), inhibits growth of several human carcinoma cells in culture and stimulates proliferation of human fibroblasts and certain other tumor cells. It has been purified to apparent homogeneity from serum-free conditioned medium of MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells that had been treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. AR is a single-chain extremely hydrophilic glycoprotein containing cysteines in disulfide linkage(s) that are essential for biological activity; it is stable between pH 2 and pH 12 and after heating for 30 min at 56 degrees C but unstable at 100 degrees C. The apparent molecular weights of AR and N-Glycanase-treated AR are 14,000 and 15,000, respectively, as assessed by gel chromatography, and approximately 22,500 and approximately 14,000, respectively, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment of AR with N-Glycanase, O-Glycanase, or neuraminidase does not affect its activity. The pI of AR is approximately 7.8. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of AR has been determined, and no significant sequence homology between AR and other proteins was found. The molecule thus appears to be a distinct growth regulatory protein.\r"

The Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, which is also defective in LDL receptor activity, provides an excellent animal model of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. As a step toward development of effective gene therapy for familial hypercholesterolemia, we have constructed a transmissible retroviral vector containing a full-length human cDNA for the LDL receptor. WHHL fibroblasts infected in vitro expressed the human receptor efficiently, as indicated by RNA and ligand blotting studies. Infected fibroblasts bound and degraded a monoclonal antibody specific for the human LDL receptor (IgGC7) in a manner comparable to that seen with normal human fibroblasts. Human LDL was also degraded by infected WHHL cells and promoted cholesterol esterification to the same degree as seen in normal human fibroblasts. Although technical problems remain to be solved, these studies show that, in principle, gene therapy may be possible for familial hypercholesterolemia patients.\r"

Cultured glia from specific regions of embryonic day 17 and neonatal day 1 rat brain were identified as astrocytes on the basis of both morphology and expression of immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein. The level of preproenkephalin mRNA in cultured neonatal hypothalamic astrocytes was comparable to levels present in cultured embryonic striatal and hypothalamic neurons. Levels of the mRNA were significantly higher in astrocytes derived from neonatal hypothalamus compared to astrocytes derived from other areas of the brain. Thus, there is heterogeneity among astrocytes with respect to preproenkephalin expression. Levels of preproenkephalin mRNA in cultured neonatal striatal astrocytes were only one-third as high as levels in embryonic striatal astrocytes; this observation suggests that glial expression of the gene may be down-regulated during development. Although cultured hypothalamic neurons contained substantial levels of prodynorphin mRNA, levels of this mRNA were not detectable in cultured astrocytes from any brain region or in cultured striatal neurons. Thus, glia do not express all opioid peptide genes during development. These observations suggest that expression of the preproenkephalin gene by astrocytes may play a role in development of the brain.\r"

In 784 chromosome spreads hybridized with human DBI cDNA, the distribution of 1476 labeled sites revealed a significant clustering of autoradiographic grains (11.3% of total label) on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q). Furthermore, 63.5% of the grains found on 2q were located on 2q12-21, suggesting regional mapping of DBI gene(s) to this segment. Secondary hybridization signals were frequently observed on other chromosomes and they were statistically significant mainly for chromosomes 5, 6, 11, and 14. In addition, DNA from 32 human-mouse cell hybrids was digested with BamHI and probed with human DBI cDNA. A 3.5-kilobase band, which probably represents the human DBI gene, was assigned to chromosome 2. Four higher molecular weight bands, also detected in BamHI digests, could not be unequivocally assigned. A chromosome 2 location was excluded for the 27-, 13-, and 10-kilobase bands. These results assign a human DBI gene to chromosome 2 (2q12-21) and indicate that three of the four homologous sequences detected by the human DBI probe are located on three other chromosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Infusion of rats with optimal doses of caerulein for up to 24 hr resulted in divergent changes in protein synthesis in the exocrine pancreas: a 3-fold increase in synthesis of anionic trypsinogen and a 75% decrease in synthesis of amylase. Lipase synthesis showed no change. Rates of total protein synthesis increased 2-fold, while DNA, RNA, and poly(A)+ mRNA concentrations were unchanged during hormonal stimulation. mRNA concentrations for anionic trypsinogen, lipase, and amylase were determined by dot blot hybridization analysis with cDNA and cRNA probes. Despite 12-fold changes in the ratio of synthesis of anionic trypsinogen to amylase at 24 hr of caerulein stimulation, changes in levels of mRNA encoding these two proteins were not observed. The slight decreases observed in amylase mRNA concentrations were found in both hormone and saline-infused animals. In vitro pulse-chase experiments after 12 hr of saline or caerulein infusion indicated that differential turnover of anionic trypsinogen and amylase did not occur during hormone stimulation. These data demonstrate that the differential regulation observed in protein synthesis that results from a single period of hormone stimulation is mediated by differential regulation of mRNA translation. The high degree of conservation observed in the 5' terminal sequences of both amylase and anionic trypsinogen mRNAs between mouse, rat, and dog suggests that sequence-specific mechanisms and secondary structure may play a role in the translational control of these two mRNAs.\r"

The nuclear antigen proteins EBNA1-EBNA4 of the EBV latent state contain separate significant clusters of charge of each sign. They (excepting EBNA4) also feature distinctive periodic charge patterns [e.g., (+, O)8, (O, -, -)7] and significant tandem repeats. None of the other ORFs (about 80) of the genome possess the conjunction of these properties. Only the protein encoded from BMLF1, the first immediate early transactivator protein, contains significant multiple charge clusters and periodic charge patterns. All proteins that contain significant repeats also contain at least one significant charge cluster of a single sign. These include EBNA5 and LYDMA produced during latency and BZLF1, whose expression terminates latency and initiates productive growth. It is reasonable to conclude that these aggregate significant charge configurations and repeats are important functionally for the latent existence and for the initiation of the lytic cycle and may be characteristic of these conditions. We discuss how large multimeric protein structures bound together by clusters of unlike charge may provide a mechanism for regulation of the expression of these proteins.\r"

We have demonstrated that the vasoactive intestinal peptide regulatory element is an enhancer that depends upon the integrity of two CGTCA sequence motifs for biological activity. Mutations in either of the CGTCA motifs diminish the ability of the element to respond to cAMP. Enhancers containing the CGTCA motif from the somatostatin and adenovirus genes compete for binding of nuclear proteins from C6 glioma and PC12 cells to the vasoactive intestinal peptide enhancer, suggesting that CGTCA-containing enhancers interact with similar transacting factors.\r"

The N-terminal and the C-terminal domains are composed mainly of alpha-helices, and the middle domain is packed with orthogonal beta-sheets. The FAD has an extended conformation: the flavin ring lies between the N-terminal and the beta-sheet domains, and the adenine moiety is found at the junction between the C-terminal and the beta-sheet domains of one subunit and the C-terminal domain of a neighboring subunit. The polypeptide chain folding near the FAD binding site is different from those observed in other flavoproteins, such as glutathione reductase and glycolate oxidase.\r"

Mutations that changed the electrophoretic mobility of the protein also caused a corresponding shift in the migration of the cell-binding activity, showing that the comigrating protein was indeed invasin. Monoclonal antibodies directed against invasin that blocked invasin-HEp-2 cell interaction also inhibited bacteria from penetrating HEp-2 cells, indicating that interaction of this protein with animal cells is critical for cellular penetration.\r"

In vivo genomic footprinting with dimethyl sulfate revealed different patterns of DNA protection in silent and expressed genes. In rooster liver cells, at least 10 base pairs of DNA, including the methylated CpG, were protected by protein(s). Gel-shift assays indicated that a protein factor, present in rooster liver nuclear extract, bound at this site only when it was methylated. In hen liver cells, the same unmethylated CpG lies within a protected region of approximately equal to 20 base pairs. In vitro DNase I protection and gel-shift assays indicate that this sequence is bound by a protein, which binds both double- and single-stranded DNA.

  ".W": "The relationship between the mechanical and biochemical states of the muscle cross-bridge cycle and the control of contraction were investigated by using the nucleotide analogs adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (ATP[gamma S]) and caged ATP[gamma S] [the O-1(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl P3-ester of ATP[gamma S]]. ATP[gamma S] interacts with actomyosin in a manner similar to ATP but is hydrolyzed (by a factor of 500) more slowly. Generation of ATP[gamma S] by photolysis of caged ATP[gamma S] within a permeabilized fiber in rigor in the absence of Ca2+ relaxed tension and stiffness as occurs with ATP. The transient rise in tension prior to final relaxation observed with photolysis of caged ATP was absent with caged ATP[gamma S]. This result suggests that following detachment of a cross-bridge, ATP is normally hydrolyzed before force generation. In the presence of Ca2+, photolysis of caged ATP[gamma S] within rigor fibers caused tension to relax fully but significant stiffness remained. Stiffness also developed without concomitant tension when Ca2+ concentration was raised from less than 1 nM to 30 microM in the presence of ATP[gamma S]. The amplitude of the tension response to ramp stretches in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP[gamma S] increased with ramp stretch velocity, suggesting that the cross-bridges have detachment rate constants extending into the 10(3) s-1 range. The results provide evidence that the Ca2+-regulatory system can directly control attachment of cross-bridges into states before the power stroke.\r"

The acetylcholine conformation was determined in the free and bound states by proton NMR two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effects. In agreement with x-ray crystallographic data, acetylcholine in solution has an extended conformation with an average distance between the acetyl methyl and choline methyl protons of approximately equal to 5 A. When bound to the acetylcholine receptor, acetylcholine adopts a conformation where the acetyl methyl group is close (3.3 A) to the methyl groups of the choline moiety. This bent conformation places the oxygens adjacent to one another and allows the methyl groups to form an uninterrupted hydrophobic surface over the rest of the acetylcholine molecule. The significant difference between the free- and bound-state conformations implies that structure-activity studies based solely on molecular modeling strategies must be approached with caution.\r"

In contrast, mutual diffusion is inhibited by attractions but is enhanced by repulsions. It is shown that such interaction-dependent differences in self diffusion and mutual diffusion could underlie, among other things, the disparity in protein diffusion coefficients extracted from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and postelectrophoresis relaxation data.\r"

  ".W": "The slender bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei shows receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles of its hosts. We have purified the LDL receptor of this species nearly to homogeneity (about 1000-fold purification) and obtained monospecific polyclonal antibodies against it. As analyzed by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified receptor consists of a single subunit, with an apparent molecular mass of 86 kDa. Its isoelectric point is 5.9. On the average, each cell exposes 52,000 copies of low-affinity receptors (Kd of 250 nM) and 1800 copies of high-affinity receptors (Kd of 5.7 nM). According to indirect en bloc immunolabeling of fixed parasites, the receptor appears to be localized to the flagellar pocket membrane and the flagellar membrane and to be completely absent from the rest of the pericellular membrane. LDL is required for optimal growth of the trypanosome in vitro: cell growth can be inhibited either by removal of LDL from the culture medium or by antibodies against the purified LDL receptors. In both cases, growth is restored by the addition of excess LDL.\r"

This technique enabled us to localize alpha-actinin within the cytoskeletal networks at high resolution and in three dimensions. Colloidal gold, indicating the presence of alpha-actinin, was localized on the Z bands of nascent myofibrils in myocytes and on stress fiber bundles in nonmuscle cells. alpha-Actinin staining was also seen on stellate foci, where cytoskeletal filaments converged along the inner myocyte cell membranes. Intermediate filaments were associated with Z bands of myofibrils, stress fibers, and subplasmalemmal actin networks at the specific points where alpha-actinin was localized on these structures. Heavy meromyosin treatment prior to immunostaining confirmed that the thin filaments contained actin. These results suggest that alpha-actinin serves to interlink these various cytoskeletal elements. In addition, this protein may be involved in the initial phases of filament organization during myofibrillogenesis along the inner surface of the myocyte plasma membrane.\r"

Cell enlargement in the two situations could be regulated by similar early events with an interruption of the cell cycle occurring in hypertrophy, or the two processes could be uncoupled. In vivo models were used to compare hypertrophy induced by unilateral nephrectomy and hyperplasia induced by folic acid injection in rabbit renal cortical cells. Within 48 hr, cell volume increased in both groups but the number of cells in the cell cycle and DNA synthesis was increased only after folic acid. Patterns of mRNA expression of the following three groups of cell cycle-dependent genes were analyzed: (i) protooncogenes (c-fos, c-myc, and c-Ha-ras), (ii) structural protein genes (vimentin and beta-actin), and (iii) transport protein genes (Na+, K+-ATPase, ADP-ATP translocase, and calcyclin). mRNAs for all genes, except calcyclin and c-Ha-ras, were detected in controls. Folic acid generally induced rapid, transient increases in mRNA levels, but after unilateral nephrectomy, expression of most mRNAs showed a gradual, progressive increase. These data indicate that gene expression in the early stages of cell enlargement differs in cells destined to undergo proliferation vs. hypertrophy. The term \"sustained message amplification\" is proposed to describe the hypertrophied cell.\r"

All detected polypeptides were sensitive to Pronase digestion, whereas several polypeptides were resistant to trypsin. Pronase treatment of the cell monolayer significantly reduced the specific binding of radioiodinated rat serum albumin, but trypsin digestion did not. Limax flavus, Ricinus communis, and Triticum vulgaris agglutinins competed significantly with radioiodinated rat serum albumin binding, whereas other lectins did not. A single 60-kDa glyco-protein was precipitated in common by these three lectins and was trypsin-resistant and Pronase-sensitive. Rat serum albumin affinity chromatography columns weakly but specifically bound a 60-kDa polypeptide from cell lysates derived from radioiodinated cell monolayers. These findings indicate that the 60-kDa glycoprotein is directly involved in a specific interaction of albumin with the cultured microvascular endothelial cells used in these experiments.\r"

The result of this decrease is the spontaneous differentiation into cells that resemble retinoic acid-treated F9 cells as judged by plasminogen activator assays. In contrast, when F9 cells are transfected with a plasmid expressing Myc under control of the SV40 early promoter, resulting cell clones are resistant to differentiation by retinoic acid as shown by the lack of induction of plasminogen activator. These results suggest that down-regulation of Myc is sufficient and necessary for F9 cell differentiation.\r"

The most parsimonious tree shows that FMDV subtypes and isolates within subtypes constitute sets of related, nonidentical genomes, in agreement with a quasispecies mode of evolution of this virus. The average number of nucleotide replacements per site for all possible pairs of VP1 coding segments is higher among representatives of serotype A than serotype C or O. In comparing amino acid sequences, the values of dispersion index (variance/mean value) are greater than 1, with the highest values scored when all sequences are considered. This indicates an accumulation of mutations at a limited number of residues, suggesting that distributions of sequences fluctuate around points of high stability. Evolution of FMDV follows a path very distant from that of a star phylogeny, and it has not been possible to derive conclusions on constancy of evolutionary rates with the test applied to the analysis. FMDVs, as other RNA viruses, are of limited genetic complexity and their population sizes are extremely large. Their evolution concerns complex, indeterminate mixtures of genomes rather than a single, determinate species.\r"

Transposition immunity was cis-acting and independent of its location on a target plasmid. An additional copy of an immunity site reduced transposition a factor of 10 further. Transposition immunity was seen both during full phage lytic growth, with all the bacteriophage Mu genes, and during normal cellular growth, with a mini-Mu element containing only the Mu c and ner regulatory and A and B transposition genes.\r"

In several types of cancer, amplification of specific oncogenes is correlated with the stage of tumor progression. To estimate the frequency of gene amplification in other tumor types and to determine whether the ability to grow in vivo is associated with gene amplification in tumor cell lines, we have developed a modified version of the in-gel renaturation assay that detects human DNA sequences of unknown nature amplified as little as 7- to 8-fold. This assay was used to screen 16 cell lines derived from various solid tumors and leukemias. Amplified DNA sequences were detected in only one cell line, Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma. This cell line was found to contain coamplified NGL (formerly termed neu) and ERBA1 oncogenes. However, when one of the amplification-negative cell lines, PC-3 prostatic carcinoma, was selected for in vivo growth in nude mice, amplified DNA sequences became detectable in these cells. The amplified sequences included the MYC oncogene, which showed no amplification in the parental cell line but was amplified 10- to 12-fold in the in vivo-selected cells. MYC amplification may, therefore, provide tumor cells with a selective advantage specific for in vivo growth.\r"

The modeled combining site of W3129 has a protrusion on one side, formed by the long complementarity-determining region 1 of the light chain and the long complementarity-determining region 3 of the heavy chain, and has a cavity accommodating a glucose moiety. The model of the 19.1.2 site is basically flat with a shallow groove that can accommodate several internal glucose units. These results support the earlier conclusions, from ligand binding data, that W3129 has a cavity-type site, involving the terminal nonreducing glucose residue (endbinder), whereas 19.1.2 has a groove-type site.\r"

The immune globulin was treated with pepsin to render it intravenously tolerable. The preparation, which we termed HIVIG, neutralized 100 tissue culture 50% infective doses (TCID50) of HIV at an average dilution of 1:1000 in neutralization tests in vitro. During preparation HIVIG was subjected to virus inactivation and removal procedures that in theory resulted in a reduction in HIV infectivity by a factor of 10(25). At a dose of 9-10 ml/kg of body weight both the virus-inactivated source plasma and the final immunoglobulin preparation were noninfective and without adverse effect in two chimpanzees. Two chimpanzees inoculated intravenously with HIVIG at 1 ml/kg and two inoculated with 10 ml/kg were challenged intravenously 1 day later with 400 TCID50 of the same strain of HIV (HTLV-IIIb) used in neutralization assays in vitro. All animals became infected. Incubation periods to virus isolation (by cocultivation with human mononuclear cells) in HIVIG recipients did not differ significantly from the incubation period seen in a control animal that received a normal anti-HIV-free immunoglobulin. These findings may have implications for understanding the failure of experimental vaccines to protect against HIV challenge in chimpanzee experiments.\r"

We have assessed the impact of liposome composition on their clearance from the circulation in normal and tumor-bearing mice and on their uptake by tumors and various normal tissues. By selective changes in lipid composition, while maintaining a mean particle diameter of approximately equal to 100 nm, we have achieved up to a 60-fold increase in the fraction of recovered dose present in blood 24 hr after i.v. injection. Concomitantly, there was a decrease by a factor of 4 of the recovered dose localizing in the liver and spleen, the major organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Parallel experiments in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated a 25-fold increase of the liposome concentration in the tumor when formulations with long and short blood residence time were compared. The most favorable results were obtained with liposomes containing a small molar fraction of a negatively charged glycolipid, such as monosialoganglioside or phosphatidylinositol, and a solid-phase neutral phospholipid as the bulk component. The bio-distribution of such formulations is of considerable therapeutic potential in cancer for increasing the concentration of cytotoxic agents in tumors while minimizing the likelihood of toxicity to the reticuloendothelial system.\r"

Studies in whole muscle are confounded by heterogeneity; however, achieving the low oxygen tensions required to study anoxia in a single myocyte during electrophysiological recording has been a barrier in experimental design. Guided by calculations of oxygen transport, we developed a system to insulate myocytes in an open dish from oxygen by a laminar counterflowing argon column, permitting free access to the cell by microelectrodes while maintaining a PO2 less than 0.02 torr (1 torr = 133 Pa). In the absence of glucose, the amplitude of stimulated contraction of anoxic ventricular myocytes fell to zero over 2 min after a lag period attributable to the consumption of endogenous glycogen. The cytosolic calcium concentration transient, measured by indo-1 fluorescence, fell to zero simultaneously with contraction. After the twitch had failed, microinjection of caffeine around the cell still caused a large calcium release and contraction, indicating that sarcoplasmic reticular calcium stores were not depleted. Twitch failure was accompanied by shortening and then failure of the action potential; under voltage clamp, large outward currents, reversing at the resting potential, developed during contractile failure. After failure of action potential-mediated contraction, voltage-clamp depolarization, with a large command voltage to compensate for the series-resistance error due to outward currents, restored normal twitch contraction. We conclude that anoxic contractile failure in the rat myocyte is due to alteration of the action potential and the distal pathways of excitation-contraction coupling remain essentially intact.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and sequenced four overlapping cDNA clones from a normal adult human colon library, which together gave the entire nucleotide sequence for biliary glycoprotein I (BGP I). BGP I is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, which is a subfamily in the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The deduced amino acid sequence of the combined clones for BGP I revealed a 34-residue leader sequence followed by a 108-residue N-terminal domain, a 178-residue immunoglobulin-like domain, a 108-residue region specific to BGP I, a 24-residue transmembrane domain, and a 35-residue cytoplasmic domain. The nucleotide sequence of BGP I exhibited greater than 80% identity with CEA and nonspecific crossreacting antigen (NCA) in the leader peptide, N-terminal domain, and immunoglobulin-like domain. The BGP I-specific domain, designated A', was 56.7% and 55.8% identical at the nucleotide level and 42.6% and 39.6% identical at the amino acid level to the immunoglobulin-like domain of NCA and the first immunoglobulin-like domain of CEA, respectively. Beyond nucleotide position 1375 the 3' region of the BGP I cDNA was found to be specific for BGP I. Hybridization of a probe from this region to electrophoretic blots of RNAs from different human tissues showed a predominant 2.8-kilobase (kb) message accompanied by weaker bands 4.1 and 2.1 kb in size. The same probe gave a single band in Southern blot analysis of restricted total human DNA. Using a coding region probe from the BGP I domain A', we observed 4.1- and 2.1-kb messages. Lack of the 2.8-kb band suggested that different forms of BGP I may be generated by posttranscriptional modification of the same gene. We propose that BGP I diverged from NCA by acquiring an immunoglobulin-like domain substantially different from the domains found in NCA or CEA and also a new cytoplasmic domain. The latter feature should result in a substantially different membrane anchorage mechanism of BGP I compared to CEA, which lacks the cytoplasmic domain and is anchored via a phosphatidylinositol-glycan structure. Protein structural analysis of BGP I isolated from human bile revealed a blocked N terminus, 129 amino acids of internal sequence that are in agreement with the translated cDNA sequence, and five glycosylation sites in the peptides sequenced.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has shown that freshly isolated lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects show significantly reduced basal and adenosine receptor-stimulated cAMP levels. This decrease could be due to ethanol-induced cellular adaptation or to a genetic difference in the regulation of cAMP signal transduction. Therefore, we cultured human lymphocytes in defined medium without ethanol for 7-8 days and then examined differences in receptor-dependent cAMP accumulation between lymphocytes from alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects. After four to six generations in culture without ethanol, lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects have significantly higher cAMP levels than do cells from nonalcoholic subjects. Thus, a difference in cAMP signal transduction is demonstrable in cells from alcoholic subjects grown without ethanol. We also found that cultured lymphocytes from both alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects show a decrease in receptor-stimulated cAMP levels after exposure to 200 mM ethanol for 48 hr. To determine whether alcoholic subjects have increased sensitivity to ethanol, lymphocytes were exposed to only 100 mM ethanol for 24 hr. Under these conditions, receptor-dependent cAMP levels did not change in cells from nonalcoholic subjects. However, lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects showed a 39% decrease (P less than 0.003) in adenosine receptor-stimulated cAMP levels. Taken together, the results show that (i) chronic ethanol treatment in culture reproduces the suppression of cAMP levels found in circulating lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects and (ii) despite four to six cell divisions in culture without ethanol, lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects exhibit significantly increased adenosine receptor-dependent cAMP levels and increased sensitivity to chronic exposure to ethanol. These findings suggest that the suppression of cAMP levels observed in freshly isolated lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects results from both a direct effect of chronic exposure to ethanol and a genetic difference leading to altered cAMP signal transduction.\r"

We report (i) the solubilization of this mitogenic activity from rat dorsal root ganglion neurons grown in tissue culture and (ii) the solubilization and partial purification of mitogenic activity from neonatal rat brains. Extracted mitogenic activity is peripheral rather than intrinsic to the membrane, stable after extraction, and active as a mitogen in the absence of serum (the most stringent criterion defining the neuronal mitogen). We have previously provided evidence suggesting that a neuronal cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan is required for expression of the neurons' mitogenic activity. We now show that mitogenic activity can be extracted from the membrane dissociated from proteoglycan as assayed by its ability to bind to immobilized heparin. After dissociation, low concentrations of heparin (1 micrograms/ml) inhibit the ability of the mitogen to stimulate Schwann cell division. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is weakly mitogenic for Schwann cells, but it is not present in mitogenic brain extracts (based on immunoblotting). Immunodepletion experiments with specific antibodies to FGF indicate that the mitogenic activity extracted from neurons is not a form of this heparin-binding mitogen. Acidic FGF is not mitogenic for Schwann cells and is not present in mitogenic brain extracts. We suggest that these and previous data indicate the neurite mitogen is a proteoglycan-growth factor complex that limits mitogenic activity to the axonal surface, protects mitogen against inactivation by other proteoglycans, and provides for effective presentation of mitogen to the Schwann cell.\r"

This reaction requires the autophosphorylated, Ca2+-independent form of CaM-kinase II since Ca2+/CaM binding to calcineurin inhibits phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation reaction does require Ca2+, presumably acting through the 19-kDa subunit of calcineurin. Calcineurin is a good substrate for CaM-kinase II, with a Km of 19 microM and Vmax of 2.4 mumol/min per mg. Phosphorylation of calcineurin changed its phosphatase activity with either a 2-fold increase in Km (32P-labeled myosin light chain as substrate) or a 50% decrease in Vmax (p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate). The phosphorylated calcineurin exhibited very slow autodephosphorylation (0.09 nmol/min per mg) but was effectively dephosphorylated by brain protein phosphatase IIA. Dephosphorylation, like phosphorylation, was blocked by high concentrations of Ca2+/CaM and stimulated by Ca2+ alone. Thus calcineurin has a regulatory phosphorylation site that is phosphorylated by the Ca2+-independent form of CaM-kinase II and blocked by high concentrations of Ca2+/CaM.\r"

This gender difference arises after hatching as a result of cell atrophy in the female and cell growth in the male. Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.\r"

The cellular location of DBI mRNA was studied in rat brain and selected peripheral tissues by in situ hybridization histochemistry with a 35S-labeled single-stranded complementary RNA probe. DBI mRNA was heterogeneously distributed in rat brain, with particularly high levels in the area postrema, the cerebellar cortex, and ependyma of the third ventricle. Intermediate levels were found in the olfactory bulb, pontine nuclei, inferior colliculi, arcuate nucleus, and pineal gland. Relatively low but significant levels of silver grains were observed overlying many mesencephalic and telencephalic areas that have previously been shown to contain numerous DBI-immunoreactive neurons and a high density of central benzodiazepine receptors. In situ hybridizations also revealed high levels of DBI mRNA in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, liver, and germinal center of the white pulp of spleen, all tissues that are rich in peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. The tissue-specific pattern of DBI gene expression described here could be exploited to further understand the physiological function of DBI in the brain and periphery.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that mudpuppy taste receptor cells respond to sour taste stimuli (weak acids) with depolarizing receptor potentials or action potentials that are blocked by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium. Voltage-clamp recordings from isolated taste cells indicated that taste receptor cells exhibit a variety of voltage-dependent conductances and that acids reduce a voltage-dependent K+ current. Since taste stimuli are restricted to the apical surface of the intact tongue, only 1-2% of the taste receptor cell surface is exposed to chemical stimuli. Thus, modification of a K+ conductance would be an effective transduction mechanism in receptor cells only if the majority of K+ channels were located on the apical membrane. We have used a combination of \"loose-patch\" and whole-cell recording methods to map the distribution of voltage-sensitive K+ and Na+ channels on dissociated Necturus maculosus taste cells. We report here that the K+ conductance is approximately equal to 50-fold greater on apical membrane than on basolateral membrane, whereas the Na+ conductance is distributed evenly. The marked nonuniformity of the voltage-sensitive K+ conductance, together with the block of this conductance by sour stimuli, indicates that K+ current modulation is the mechanism of sour taste transduction.\r"

Colloidal gold staining under the electron microscope was associated with 80- to 100-nm vesicles of average electron density, widely dispersed in the neuropil, with usually one and no more than four vesicles in individual sectioned neuronal processes. Analysis of fluorescence images in paired serial sections of thicknesses varying from 25 to 150 nm proved that the 200- to 400-nm dots of fluorescence came from smaller structures, presumably the 80- to 100-nm vesicles.

Cells from the apical region of the cochlea (long cells) responded by increasing their length, whereas those from more basal regions (short cells) responded by decreasing their length. Cells from intermediate positions showed an equal probability for either elongating or shortening. Both the elongating and shortening response was inhibited by 3 microM poly(L-lysine). It is suggested that this tonotopic and bidirectional acoustic response may be one of the active components underlying the specific phase and frequency displacement of the basilar membrane.\r"

The coding sequence for mature SAP-2 was located 3' to that coding for SAP-1 in the SAP precursor cDNA. Both SAP-1 and SAP-2 appeared to be derived by proteolytic processing from a common precursor that is coded by a genetic locus on human chromosome 10. Two other domains similar to SAP-1 and SAP-2 were also identified in SAP precursor protein. Each of the four domains was approximately 80 amino acid residues long, had nearly identical placement of cysteine residues, potential glycosylation sites, and proline residues. Each domain also contained internal amino acid sequences capable of forming amphipathic helices separated by helix breakers to give a cylindrical hydrophobic domain that is probably stabilized by disulfide bridges. Protein immunoblotting experiments indicated that SAP precursor protein (70 kilodaltons) as well as immunoreactive SAP-like proteins of intermediate sizes (65, 50, and 31 kilodaltons) are present in most human tissues.\r"

A second RNA pol I transcription factor, designated SL1, participates in the promoter recognition process and is required to reconstitute transcription in vitro. Although SL1 alone has no sequence-specific DNA binding activity, deoxyribonuclease I footprinting experiments reveal that a cooperative interaction between UBF1 and SL1 leads to the formation of a new protein-DNA complex at the UCE and core elements. In vitro transcription experiments indicate that formation of the UBF1-SL1 complex is vital for transcriptional activation by UBF1. Thus, protein-protein interactions between UBF1 and SL1 are required for targeting of SL1 to cis-control sequences of the promoter.\r"

Third, OTF-1 can substitute for NF-III in activating the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. Fourth, the ability of OTF-1 to stimulate viral DNA replication is dependent on the presence of an intact NF-III binding site within the origin of replication. Fifth, NF-III can substitute for OTF-1 in activating in vitro transcription from the human histone H2b promoter. These data suggest the possibility that NF-III/OTF-1 is a protein that functions in both cellular DNA replication and transcription.\r"

Before this time, development is directed by maternal proteins and messenger RNAs stored within the egg. Two different forms of the A chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are shown here to be encoded by maternal messenger RNAs. The two forms closely resemble human PDGF; however, the long form contains a hydrophobic region near the carboxyl terminus. The presence of PDGF messenger RNA in the embryo supports the idea that endogenous growth factors act at the earliest stages of embryogenesis.\r"

If before introduction of SV40 DNA into oocytes HeLa cell U1 or U2 snRNAs were injected and allowed to assemble into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)-like complexes, SV40 late RNA was as efficiently spliced as in oocytes that did not receive U1 or U2 oligonucleotides. This demonstrates that oocytes can form fully functional hybrid U1 and U2 snRNPs consisting of human snRNA and amphibian proteins.\r"

Heparin-binding growth factor-1 was shown to bind to collagen type I and type IV. When complexed with gelatin, heparin-binding growth factor-1 can induce neovascularization at polypeptide concentrations that are consistent with the biological activity of the mitogen in vitro. The adsorption strategy induces rapid blood vessel formation at and between organ- and tissue-specific sites and permits recovery of the site-specific implant for examination and manipulation by molecular methods.\r"

Agglutination was specifically inhibited by addition of synthetic peptide antigen but not by unrelated peptides. The frequency of false positive results was 0.1% with HIV-1 seronegative blood donors (n = 874). The false negative results were approximately 1% (n = 81). The autologous red cell agglutination test is potentially suitable for simple, rapid, qualitative screening for antibodies to a variety of antigens of medical and veterinary diagnostic significance.\r"

Drugs evaluated included penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. Based on in vitro testing, tetracycline, ampicillin and penicillin were ineffective against B. fragilis because of high rates of resistance to these agents (74 per cent tetracycline resistant, 80 per cent ampicillin resistant and 89 per cent penicillin resistant). Throughout the five years of the study, 5.1 per cent of the organisms studied were resistant to clindamycin compared with 2.1 per cent resistant to metronidazole (p less than 0.01) and 0.9 per cent resistant to chloramphenicol (p less than 0.001). More important than the relative resistance rates to the various antibiotics is the observation that this is a dynamic process that is influenced by local practices of administering antibiotics. In 1981, the first year of the survey, no clindamycin resistant B. fragilis isolates were identified; by 1986, 7.8 per cent of the strains proved resistant to this antibiotic. Similarly, no metronidazole or chloramphenicol resistant organisms were demonstrated in 1981 or 1982; thereafter, resistance to these two drugs was noted with increasing frequency each year. The emergence of B. fragilis strains that are resistant to the antibiotics in current use mandates the surveillance of the local susceptibility data to identify important trends. When increasing rates of resistance are noted to one antibiotic, alternative regimens can be used.\r"

We investigated the value of laparoscopy in the diagnostic evaluation for possible appendicitis in women of childbearing age. Fifty-one women were entered in a management protocol, which included diagnostic laparoscopy in instances with atypical features. Twenty patients underwent immediate appendectomy because of history and physical findings classical for appendicitis; 31 women with atypical history and physical findings underwent an initial diagnostic laparoscopy. In the group of patients who underwent immediate appendectomy because of classical presentation, five of the appendices removed were normal. At laparoscopy, appendicitis was diagnosed in five patients, another disease in 15 and no diagnostic abnormality was found in six. Five patients had a normal appendix removed, two because of questionable inflammation and three because of nonvisualization of the appendix. There were no false-negative examination results. Twenty-one patients required no further operative intervention after laparoscopy. The negative appendectomy rate remained unchanged (ten negative appendectomies of 30 performed). Definitive diagnoses of eight instances of pelvic inflammatory disease, six of ruptured ovarian cysts and one instance of ileitis of the small intestine were made earlier than would have been possible without diagnostic laparoscopy in this setting. Diagnostic laparoscopy permits earlier definitive diagnosis and prompt institution of appropriate therapy for disease of the female reproductive tract that simulates appendicitis. Caution is advised, however, when diagnostic laparoscopy is applied more frequently than right lower quadrant exploration in the management of probable appendicitis. The improvement in diagnostic accuracy may be offset by an increased number of negative appendectomies resulting from nonvisualization and false-positive inflammation.\r"

Using cyclosporine for postoperative immunosuppression, 1,500 rads reduced the incidence of acute (p = 0.05) and chronic rejection (p = 0.08), yet did not impair intestinal absorption of cyclosporine. The greatest improvement in survival occurred with 750 rads (p = 0.02). Histologic evidence of graft versus host disease appeared in the native small intestine in two of four long term surviving dogs receiving a nonirradiated graft but in none of the dogs receiving irradiated grafts. Irradiation of the graft may be a promising adjunct in the search for a clinically applicable method of intestinal transplantation.\r"

It has been postulated that absence of gastrointestinal bile salt flow in cholestasis enhances portal absorption of bacterial endotoxin from the intestine, thereby predisposing the host to endotoxemia and its complications. This study re-evaluates this pathologic mechanism, using new quantitative chromogenic and conventional qualitative limulus techniques for the detection of bacterial endotoxin. Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either ligation of bile duct or sham operation. Serum total bilirubin, serum bile acid and intestinal bile acid concentrations were determined seven, 14 and 21 days after operation. Chromogenic and conventional qualitative limulus lysate endotoxin determinations were simultaneously performed on post-operative days two, seven, 14 and 21. Serum total bilirubin and bile acid concentrations were elevated and intestinal bile acid levels depressed at days seven, 14 and 21 (p less than 0.05). Results of quantitative and qualitative limulus studies failed to demonstrated the coexisting development of portal or systemic endotoxemia in rats with the bile duct ligated after diminution of flow of gastrointestinal bile salt. These data refute the hypothesis that flow of gastrointestinal bile salt enhances portal absorption of intestinally derived endotoxin and suggest alternative mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia in obstructive jaundice.\r"

Elderly women with chronic disease were most frequently affected. Symptoms were usually intermittent; mechanical small intestinal obstruction was the most common presenting condition, followed by pain in the thigh or groin area. The Howship-Romberg sign was found in only two patients, and a correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only one patient. Midline abdominal incisions were made in all patients. Incarcerated ileum was the most frequently encountered organ in the hernia sac. Surprisingly, foci of endometriosis in the obturator defect accounted for symptoms in two patients with three obturator hernias. Right-sided obturator hernias outnumbered left, and bilateral obturator hernias were found synchronously in two instances and metachronously in one instance. The often debilitated state of the patients with obturator hernia and the frequent delay of diagnosis combined to produce significant operative morbidity and mortality rates.\r"

En bloc resection of the diseased intestine and fistula with primary anastomosis was the preferred treatment, but temporary exteriorization of the intestinal ends was undertaken in patients compromised by extensive sepsis or profound hypoalbuminemia. In 43 patients, there were 70 secondary intestinal defects caused by the fistula eroding into otherwise healthy intestine. The majority of these defects were successfully closed by primary suture; however, three secondary duodenal defects, treated by primary suture alone, failed to heal and fistulas recurred. As a result, two of these patients died of overwhelming sepsis. Since adopting closure or protection of duodenal defects by a jejunal serosal patch, this problem has not arisen again. One defect in the sigmoid colon treated by primary suture also had recurrence of fistula, probably because the repair lay adjacent to an abscess cavity. Temporary loop colostomy is now used to protect repairs of defects in the sigmoid colon undertaken in the presence of local sepsis.\r"

Cardiac related mortality rates were 2.2 per cent among patients in group 1, LVEF greater than or equal to 55 per cent; 5.4 per cent in group 2, LVEF 36 to 54 per cent, and 19.5 per cent in group 3, LVEF less than or equal to 35 per cent (p less than 0.005). Statistically significant correlation between MUGA-derived LVEF and cardiac related mortality was found in veteran patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures (both vascular and nonvascular). There was no correlation between MUGA-derived LVEF and postoperative cardiac related mortality in cardiac surgical patients. A preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Evaluation classification of IV or a preoperative pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 centimeters of water or greater also predicted an increased risk of postoperative cardiac death. We advise preoperative MUGA scans for all patients in whom the results of preoperative history or physical examination suggest compromised ventricular function. We also advise pulmonary arterial catheter hemodynamic monitoring during the perioperative period for all patients with a preoperative MUGA-derived LVEF of less than or equal to 35 per cent.\r"

The Rathke's cleft cysts were composed of a single or pseudostratified epithelial layer abutting on the connective tissue. The epithelial cells were of four different kinds of cells, such as goblet, ciliated, flat, and basal cells. The flat cells containing bundles of tonofilaments and desmosomes were the squamous cells. They were present in a single-epithelial layer in both cases. The basal cells were present as small, wedge-shaped cells, even if the number was very small. The epithelial cells in Rathke's cleft cysts were more similar to those of the mucosa in the sphenoid sinus and those of a craniopharyngioma with goblet and ciliated cells than those of the choroid plexus.

The surgical technique consisted of an anterior esophagomyotomy (6 cm long, not extending into the stomach more than 5 to 10 mm) with the addition of an anterior hemi-Nissen or Dor procedure, similar to the Thal serosal patch. No operative deaths occurred. The mean follow-up was 6.8 years, and only 1 patient was lost from this follow-up. Preoperative dysphagia, which was present in 100% of the patients, persisted only occasionally in 8%, and a significant gain in weight was recorded in 90% of the patients. In three patients epidermoid carcinoma developed 5 to 9 years after surgery. In one patient a severe gastroesophageal reflux with an esophageal ulcer developed. Radiologic studies demonstrated a significant increase in the diameter at the gastroesophageal junction and a decrease at the middle third of the esophagus (p less than 0.0001). The resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter showed a significant decrease, from 37 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg, after surgery (p less than 0.0001), when we analyzed 84 patients before and 68 patients after operation. The total length of this sphincter also decreased. The manometric evaluation of the lower esophageal sphincter pressure in the same 42 patients before, 2 months after, and 5 to 7 years after surgery demonstrated persistence of the low sphincter pressure. There was a significant increase in the amplitude of the esophageal waves, and the standard acid-reflux test demonstrated reflux into the esophagus in 19% of the patients. Final clinical evaluation showed excellent and good results in 92 of the 94 controlled patients.\r"

In five ileostomy dogs with transposed duodenal segments, electrodes were applied to the segments for monitoring electric activity and for pacing the segments in a backward or orad direction at will. After recovery, each of the fasted, conscious dogs underwent four control and four pacing experiments during which ileostomy output and enteric transit and absorption were monitored for 9 hours after a meal of 200 gm of technetium-99m-labeled liver and 50 ml of polyethylene glycol-labeled water. In pacing experiments the pacesetter potentials of the transposed segment were driven backward by pacing during the first 3 postcibal hours. Pacing markedly slowed gastrointestinal transit of both liquid and solid and decreased output from the stoma during the pacing period, thus changing an incontinent ileostomy into a more continent one. Output was only 9 +/- 3 ml/hr (mean +/- SEM) during pacing, compared with 19 +/- 3 ml/hr without pacing (p = 0.01). Pacing, however, did not improve overall enteric absorption after the meal. In conclusion, pacing a duodenal segment transposed to a preileostomy location slowed intestinal transit and converted an incontinent ileostomy into a more continent one, but it did not improve overall intestinal absorption.\r"

Respiratory failures preceding the first positive sputum culture and hepatic and/or renal failure were more frequent in the P group. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas species, as well as polymicrobial sputa, were more common in the P group. Positive blood or pleural cultures with the same organism found in the sputum were noted in 10 of 11 P patients and only 3 of 10 C patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy directed at all sputum pathogens decreased mortality in the P group but not in the C group. We conclude that an objective rating system for chest x-ray diagnosis provides a reasonable method for separating patients with pneumonia from those with colonization. We recommend antibiotic therapy directed at all sputum pathogens in patients in surgical intensive care units. For such therapy to be successful, however, diagnostic criteria must be precise and exclude patients with colonized pathogens.\r"

Patients with symptoms secondary to emboli from the carotid bifurcation tended to have a shorter duration of blindness and a lower incidence of permanent blindness initially and during follow-up. The presence of Hollenhorst plaques or retinal artery occlusion did not have any discriminatory diagnostic value since the incidence was similar in both patient groups. Since both primary eye disease and carotid bifurcation occlusive disease can be initially seen as monocular ischemia, carotid angiography and ophthalmologic consultation are necessary to select those patients who will benefit from carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Mice bearing SMT-F tumors and rats with transplanted chondrosarcomas were injected with graded doses of dihematoporphyrin ether. Studies of changes in single-vessel and whole-tumor blood flow were carried out with 630 nm light activation. A helium neon laser Doppler velocimeter was used to stimulate dihematoporphyrin ether, as well as to measure changes in flow velocity in both single-vessel and whole-tumor models. There was a reduction of flow velocity in all vessels and tumors in animals injected with 1 to 40 mg/kg dihematoporphyrin ether intraperitoneally. The extent of flow reduction was related to drug dose administered. Decreases in blood flow began within 10 seconds of light stimulation and were maximal within 5 minutes. Both normal and tumor vessels responded similarly. We conclude that photodynamic therapy leads to significant microcirculatory changes that may be pertinent to the mechanism of tumor necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "In order to improve the understanding and classification of patients with suspected arterial embolism, we performed a loglinear analysis to study the interactions among eight characteristics in 202 patients operated on as a result of this diagnosis. Female patients were generally older, were in a poorer cardiac state (NYHA class), and had shorter duration of symptoms before operation than male patients. Atrial dysrhythmias were more common in women than in men less than 75 years of age. After the age of 75, however, the incidence was similar in both sexes. Thus, apparently, poor cardiac function is more commonly associated with acute arterial occlusion in women than in men. In men arterial thrombosis secondary to arteriosclerotic occlusive disease may be more frequent. Ischemic heart disease, age of more than 75 years, and the fact that the patient was a woman were independent predictors of poor cardiac function. Atrial dysrhythmias increased the odds for proximal arterial occlusion compared with distal occlusion, but only in NYHA class 1-2, which suggests that low cardiac output might be of importance in distal thrombotic occlusion in patients with both atrial dysrhythmia and poor cardiac function. Patients with arteriosclerosis had symptoms of longer duration than patients without arteriosclerosis and men had symptoms of longer duration than women, which indicate that the diagnosis was more uncertain, or the disease less severe, in these patients. In patients without evidence of ischemic heart disease, poor cardiac function was a predictor of short duration of symptoms, which suggests that patients with nonatherosclerotic heart disease were correctly treated for arterial emboli without undue delay.\r"

  ".U": "88322061\r", 
  ".W": "Although the use of an occlusive wound covering accelerates the reepithelialization of a partial-thickness wound, it has the disadvantage of leading to wound exudate accumulation. The effect of an experimental polyetherurethane (PEU) wound covering with a high vapor permeability was compared with an occlusive wound covering (OpSite covering) and air exposure with respect to the rate of reepithelialization, eventual epidermal thickness, and scab thickness in 122 partial-thickness wounds in guinea pigs. The percentage of reepithelialization on day 2 was 85% in wounds covered with the permeable PEU membrane, whereas it was 66% and 35%, respectively, in wounds covered with the occlusive covering or exposed to air. The epidermal thickness did not differ among the three types of treatment. The scab thickness, however, was maximal in the uncovered air-exposed wounds. We conclude that epidermal wound healing is accelerated when the PEU wound covering is used. This wound-healing-promotion effect is apparently due to the high water vapor permeability of PEU, which induces clotting of the wound exudate, and subsequent jellifying of the clot layer.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether PYY would inhibit cholecystokinin-stimulated sphincter of Oddi activity in the prairie dog. In 12 prairie dogs PYY was infused intravenously at 1, 10, and 100 ng/kg/min, and arterial blood samples were obtained. A dose-response curve was obtained, with the 10 ng/kg/min dose producing serum levels of 725 pg/ml. In seven additional prairie dogs a side-hole, pressure-monitored perfusion catheter was passed into the duodenum through a choledochotomy and positioned in the sphincter of Oddi. A perfusion catheter was also placed in the gallbladder fundus. Sphincter of Oddi and gallbladder pressures were recorded before and during 20-minute infusions of cholecystokinin and then cholecystokinin plus PYY at 10 ng/kg/min. PYY significantly inhibited cholecystokinin-stimulated sphincter of Oddi phasic wave frequency (3.8 +/- 0.2 vs 3.3 +/- 0.4; p less than 0.05) and sphincter of Oddi motility index (26.2 +/- 4.3 vs 18.7 +/- 4.8; p less than 0.025) but did not affect the increase in gallbladder pressure induced by cholecystokinin. These findings are consistent with other known anticholecystokinin effects of PYY. We conclude that PYY may also inhibit sphincter of Oddi activity in the prairie dog by an anticholecystokinin effect, thus reducing flow through the sphincter.\r"

Cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and cerebral functions were examined in mature swine after their blood volume had been reduced by 40%. Hemorrhage produced significant decreases in blood pressure, cardiac output, and creatinine clearance, which were reversed with resuscitation. Resuscitation with Ringer's lactate solution required significantly more fluid and produced a significantly greater increase in intracranial pressure than did hypertonic sodium lactate solution. HSL produced significant increases in serum sodium and osmolality, which resolved within 48 hours. Hypernatremia and hyperosmolality were not associated with renal or cerebral dysfunction and were corrected through increased sodium excretion, free water intake, and a negative free water clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Most arteries follow a straight course because they are stretched by longitudinal traction. However, aneurysms and arteries in aged, hypertensive patients often exhibit tortuosity. This study was undertaken to examine mechanisms of tortuosity and the role of the arterial wall connective tissues. Experiments were performed in vitro on 48 dog carotid arteries before and after treatment with elastase or collagenase. Degradation of wall elastin caused aneurysmal dilatation and a marked decrease in longitudinal retractive force (p less than 0.05). This permitted the development of tortuosity. Degradation of wall collagen caused minimal dilatation but did cause vessel rupture; however, degradation of collagen produced no decrease in longitudinal retractive force (p = NS). These data demonstrate that failure of elastin permits vessels to (1) dilate aneurysmally and (2) elongate sufficiently to become tortuous. Failure of elastin plays a role in the tortuosity seen with age and hypertension, congenital kinking of arteries, aneurysms, and ectasias (arteriomegaly). Failure of collagen causes vessels to rupture but does not facilitate the development of tortuosity.\r"

The mean decrease in serum cholesterol concentration from the average value of 522 mg/dl on entry into the study was 32% in the surgically treated group and 10% in the conservatively treated group. One quarter of the subjects (14 of 54) had symptomatic cerebrovascular disorders and one tenth (six of 54) suffered a brain infarction at a mean age of 43 (range 30-57) years. Two thirds of the brain infarctions occurred during follow-up. The method of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia did not affect the number of new cerebrovascular events. The incidence of brain infarction was 7.4/1000/yr. The risk of brain infarction in these subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia was at least 20 times higher than in the general population.

The results showed that in spite of a good recovery in terms of discharge from the hospital, activities of daily living, and return to work, the quality of life of most patients (83%) had not been restored to the prestroke level. Deterioration among the several domains of life ranged from 39% to 80%, the lowest being in the domain of activities at home and the highest in the domain of leisure time activities. Hemispheral localization of the lesion, paresis, coordination disturbances, and especially subjective tendency to depression were highly correlated with a deterioration in the quality of life. Dependence in activities of daily living and an inability to return to work were also associated with the lack of restoration. Our results suggest that much more attention should be paid to the quality of life of stroke patients.\r"

Fourteen rabbits were randomly assigned to treatment with a 20 mg/kg i.v. loading dose followed by a 10 mg/kg/hr infusion of 0.4% dextromethorphan in normal saline or with an equivalent volume of normal saline alone. One hour after treatment, the rabbits underwent a 1-hour occlusion of the left internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. The seven dextromethorphan-treated rabbits showed a significant decrease in the area of neocortical severe ischemic neuronal damage (10.5%) compared with the seven normal saline-treated controls (49.6%, p less than 0.001). The dextromethorphan-treated rabbits also demonstrated significantly smaller areas of cortical edema (10.2%) on magnetic resonance imaging than the controls (38.6%, p less than 0.01). Analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials revealed recovery of the ipsilateral amplitude to contralateral values within 5 minutes of reperfusion in the dextromethorphan-treated rabbits but not in the controls (p less than 0.01). In our rabbit model of transient focal cerebral ischemia, dextromethorphan appears to protect the brain against ischemic neuronal damage and edema, as well as to promote neurophysiologic recovery. This clinically available drug should be further investigated as having potential therapeutic value in the treatment of stroke.\r"

Eight 125-micrograms/kg boluses of nicardipine given every 30 minutes starting 5 minutes after arterial occlusion also significantly reduced the Na+ and K+ shifts in the middle cerebral artery territory by 40% and 50%, respectively, 6 hours after arterial occlusion. Nicardipine appears to reduce Ca2+ accumulation more than it reduces Na+ and water accumulation and K+ loss.

One group of 15 gerbils received a single injection of 25 microliter of 5 microM cyclohexyladenosine into the cerebral ventricle 15 minutes after release of the occlusion. Another group of 45 gerbils received a similar injection of the vehicle. Five days after ischemia, the hippocampal histology was examined under light microscopy. In the gerbils treated with the adenosine receptor agonist N-6-cyclohexyladenosine, the CA1 region of the hippocampus showed significant quantitative pyramidal cell preservation (p less than 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). Qualitatively, substantial destruction of CA1 neurons was present in all hippocampi of the vehicle-injected gerbils. The CA1 neurons in the cyclohexyladenosine-treated gerbils did not differ from those seen in the five nonischemic controls. The precise mechanism of the protective action of cyclohexyladenosine is unknown, although it has been demonstrated that adenosine agonists reduce presynaptic glutamate release in vitro. It is possible that postischemic administration of cyclohexyladenosine decreases the release of this neurotransmitter in the intact brain as well. The concomitant reduction of the neurotoxic effect of glutamate may, therefore, result in better histologic preservation of the pyramidal cells in the postischemic CA1.\r"

A method for reliable, repeated sampling of cisternal cerebrospinal fluid was developed for this purpose. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery induced cerebral infarcts of slightly variable size with good correlation to raised neuron-specific enolase concentrations. Sham operation caused only superficial cortical damage at the site of surgery and was followed by an early, slight, and transient increase in neuron-specific enolase concentration. With our technique, the development of cerebral infarcts can be studied in individual rats under experimentally controlled conditions over an extended period of time. Analysis of neuron-specific enolase can be used in trials of drugs for mitigating the effect of ischemia. Information concerning the release of neuron-specific enolase from ischemic cerebral tissue to the cerebrospinal fluid is important because neuron-specific enolase in the cerebrospinal fluid can be determined in patients suffering from cerebrovascular insult.\r"

To determine a possible role for thromboxane A2 in the development of severe hypertension and stroke, we chronically administered the selective thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitor UK-38,485 (Dazmegrel) to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Serum thromboxane B2 (the stable hydrolysis product of thromboxane A2) generation was significantly greater in incubates of whole blood from SHRSP than in those from normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto rats and was inhibited greater than 89% by UK-38,485 administered in vivo. In 10 male SHRSP fed a Japanese-style rat chow and given 1% NaCl in drinking water to accelerate the occurrence of stroke, treatment with 100 mg/kg/day UK-38,485 by gavage starting at 8.6 weeks of age diminished systolic blood pressure elevation at 10 (205 +/- 2 vs. 220 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and 11 weeks of age (210 +/- 4 vs. 239 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) compared with 10 untreated SHRSP. The ultimate establishment of severe hypertension was not prevented by UK-38,485. Stroke-related mortality was 70% in both UK-38,485-treated and control SHRSP at 14 weeks of age. Histologic examination revealed cerebrovascular lesions consistent with the occurrence of stroke in both control and UK-38,485-treated SHRSP. Our results support a possible role for thromboxane A2 in the elevation of blood pressure in SHRSP but do not support a possible role for the prevention of stroke by thromboxane A2 synthase inhibition in these rats.\r"

In 16 percent of the patients who had straight catheterization in the recovery room a urinary tract infection developed postoperatively, and 65 percent of these patients required at least one more catheterization with 13 percent requiring a subsequent indwelling Foley catheter. The patients who had perioperative (immediately preoperatively and for 24 hours postoperatively) catheter drainage had a zero incidence of retention and only a 4 percent incidence of urinary tract infection. We recommend this regimen for elderly female patients undergoing total joint replacement under spinal anesthesia.\r"

Some factors, such as the patient's history, eventually associated urothelial carcinomas, or histologic features of malignant transformation within an inverted papilloma, must be taken into consideration. If no single indication in favor of malignancy has been disclosed, we believe follow-up with yearly endoscopic investigations, in addition to regular urine cytologies, may suffice.\r"

Although these devices are noninvasive compared with penile injections and implants, they have been used less often in clinical practice. Part of the hesitancy to prescribe these devices has been related to the lack of published data concerning the effects of constriction on penile blood flow. In this report, we utilized penile plethysmography to estimate penile blood flow on 51 men before, during, and after the use of the constrictor ring. All patients demonstrated a 70-75 percent decline in the amplitude of the pulse-volume curve during constriction, but continuous blood flow was maintained in each case. Within sixty seconds after removal of the ring, the amplitude returned to baseline values for all men, including 12 patients with a penile brachial index of less than 0.7. Among 33 patients, there was evidence of a transient increase of amplitude following constriction, which was consistent with a postischemic hyperemia. These findings suggest normal penile blood flow, and indicate that the use of constrictor rings may be safe for patients with these tracings. Penile plethysmography appears to be a useful technique to help with patient selection and constrictor ring fit. Follow-up tracings probably should be scheduled at periodic intervals for men utilizing these rings and devices.\r"

Based on response to mail and phone surveys, it is estimated that 40 percent of the clinical faculty have some interest in collaborative research. Their preferences for the approaches were: (1) randomized trials, 63 percent; (2) surveys of patients, 60 percent; (3) evaluation of physician practices, 59 percent; (4) referral of patients for research conducted elsewhere, 54 percent; (5) research involving chart review, 53 percent; and (6) research involving a change in clinical practice, 38 percent. Thus, there is preference for more complex types of studies, but this can create a dilemma for those who wish to stimulate research among unproven investigators.\r"

Evaluation of each patient included history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine or cervical cultures for bacteria, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia. Using agar plate culturing techniques, 37 patients (35 percent) were identified as having significant urine bacteria. Chlamydia was rarely associated with urinary tract symptoms. Mycoplasma hominis, however, was isolated and felt to be etiologic in 19 (22 percent) of the 88 symptomatic women (P = 0.0026). Older women (mean age 42 years, P less than 0.001) with greater than 5 white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) on microscopic urinalysis (P less than 0.001) were likely to have cystitis and significant bacteria on urine culture. Younger women (mean age 31 years, P less than 0.001) with less than 5 WBC/hpf (P less than 0.001) had negative urine cultures and were likely to have M. hominis as a pathogen. These results demonstrate that the etiology of genitourinary symptoms seen in rural family practice may vary substantially from those seen in other patient care settings.\r"

In the case of pediatric referrals, family physicians more commonly refer to general pediatricians than to pediatric subspecialists. Physicians who use pediatric subspecialists more when both are available, however, do so because of the need for a consultant with technical skill. Large numbers of internal medicine and pediatric residents are choosing subspecialties, thereby increasing availability of these subspecialties. At the same time, there is a documented need for an increased number of primary care physicians. Family physicians, general internists, and general pediatricians all need to be trained; however, because the breadth of training of the family physician prepares this practitioner to provide comprehensive primary care in a broad variety of settings, there should be an emphasis on training this specialist.\r"

These include age, weight, height, pulse, quadriceps girth, heel cord flexibility, jump reach, hang time, and grip strength. These variables are incorporated into formulae that adjust the range of \"normal\" values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure to reduce the effects of these confounding factors, thereby increasing the accuracy of the \"normal\" or \"hypertensive\" determination for each individual.\r"

Six patients (21 percent) had minor bleeding problems, and 1 developed a pseudoaneurysm at the catheterization site.

The test measured plasma glucose 1 hour after administration of a 50-gram oral glucose load. Those patients with a plasma glucose greater than 140 mg/dL were given a standard 3-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) using 100 g of oral glucose. Patients with risk factors were compared with those without risk factors. There was no significant difference between the two groups for number of abnormal 3-hour GTTs. We conclude that in order to identify GDM, all pregnant patients must be screened. Universal screening was found to be simple and cost effective.\r"

We studied glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), filtration fraction (FF), total renal area (TRA), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in 22 female patients with verified renal scarring and a history of febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and in 9 healthy age-matched women with normal urograms and no history of symptomatic UTI. The patients with renal scarring had significantly lower GFR, smaller TRA and higher SBP than the healthy controls, but not significantly different RPF or FF. A decrease in GFR and RPF was associated with higher SBP and DBP in the patients with renal scarring. RPF/TRA, representing an approximation of the perfusion of renal tissue and GFR/TRA, were similar in patients with renal scarring and healthy controls. A reduction of renal parenchyma was accompanied by a proportional decrease in GFR and RPF, resulting in unchanged FF. These findings do not support the concept of hyperfiltration as a main cause of renal insufficiency in patients with pyelonephritis renal scarring. An increase in FF and a decrease in GFR/TRA and RPF/TRA was associated with higher DBP and a decrease in GFR/TRA and RPF/TRA with an increase in the urinary albumin excretion. We conclude that renal hemodynamics play an important part in the blood pressure control of patients with renal scarring and that in these patients with various degrees of renal failure there was no evidence of hyperfiltration or hyperperfusion by remnant glomeruli.\r"

From the RNA were calculated the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a quantified phase image, the phase standard deviation (phase-SD), representing the timing of the left ventricular contraction. The mean phase-SD was significantly higher among these patients (18 degrees, 19 degrees and 18 degrees, respectively, at the three investigations) compared to phase-SD in normals (6 degrees), indicating an impaired timing of the left ventricular (LV) contraction. At all three investigations a significant correlation was found between the phase-SD and the LVEF (r = -0.58, r = -0.74 and r = -0.75, respectively) and the corrected QT interval (r = 0.27, r = 0.44 and r = 0.39, respectively). Maximal serum ASAT in patients with their first MI correlated significantly to phase-SD. Low exercise capacity or unfavourable NYHA classification was associated with high phase-SD. Phase-SD higher than mean was also associated with significantly increased mortality during the follow-up year (p = 0.0057). In conclusion, phase-SD, reflecting the timing of the LV contraction wave, is easily accessible and clinically relevant. It merits further investigation as a prognostic factor after an MI.\r"

  ".W": "Salvage of the ischemic myocardium by coronary thrombolysis and mechanical recanalization (simulated angioplasty) was studied in a canine experimental model of acute myocardial infarction induced by coronary occlusive thrombus at the left anterior descending coronary artery. Forty-four open-chest dogs divided into three groups were studied. Group I (n = 15, control group) was observed for 6 hours following the onset of infarct. In group II (n = 14, thrombolysis group), thrombolysis was obtained by intravenous administration of urokinase 2 hours after the onset of infarct. In group III (n = 15, mechanical recanalization group), simulated angioplasty was performed 2 hours after infarct. Coronary reperfusion was continued for 4 hours in groups II and III. The areas of left ventricular risk and infarct were measured by double staining methods with Evans blue dye and triphenyl tetrazolium hydrochloride. There were no significant differences in control blood flow and risk area in the three groups. Myocardial infarct area/risk area was 65 +/- 3% in group I, 45 +/- 1% in group II, and 35 +/- 2% in group III (group I vs II, p less than 0.001; group II vs III, p less than 0.001). Restored coronary blood flow in the left anterior descending artery was 8 +/- 1 ml/min in group II and 14 +/- 1 ml/min in group III (p less than 0.001). The data suggest that coronary mechanical recanalization is more effective than thrombolysis in salvaging the ischemic myocardium in the early phase of myocardial infarction, most probably because coronary blood flow is better restored by mechanical recanalization.\r"

Acute reocclusion, 1 to 96 hours after successful PTCA, occurred in 22 of 1238 patients (1.8%). Patients undergoing PTCA in the setting of acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Out of 22 patients, 15 had a nonocclusive dissection and four had evidence of small intracoronary thrombus immediately post-PTCA, with no evidence of flow disturbance. Acute reocclusion occurred within 5 hours of heparin discontinuation in 12 patients or while they were receiving inadequate anticoagulation (four patients). In 16 of 22 (73%) patients, acute reocclusion was temporally related to a time of diminished anticoagulation. Redilation was attempted in 14 patients and was ultimately successful in five patients (36%). Ten patients required coronary artery bypass surgery and three patients died. Our findings suggest that acute reocclusion after an initially successful PTCA has a poor outcome and seems to be temporally related to the loss of effective anticoagulation in most of these patients. It is advisable to discontinue heparin infusion at a time when facilities for urgent revascularization are available.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the relationship between metabolic and functional alterations during acute regional ischemia in vivo. Phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), inorganic phosphate, and intracellular pH (pHi) were monitored in 11 pigs at 2-minute intervals during 4 and 20 minutes of acute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 20 minutes of reperfusion. In a parallel series of experiments, segment shortening was continuously monitored by sonomicrometry during the early ischemic period. Segment shortening decreased precipitously after coronary occlusion, and systolic expansion was noted within 30 seconds. Phosphocreatine levels decreased rapidly and reached a minimum value of 44 +/- 13% (mean +/- SE) of the control value by 20 minutes of ischemia. Ischemia-induced reduction of ATP was small and not statistically significant. Inorganic phosphate increased rapidly to a peak level of 158 +/- 9% of the control value by 4 minutes of ischemia. Intracellular pH decreased 0.76 +/- 0.04 units during the initial 10 minutes of ischemia and subsequently stabilized. After reperfusion, phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate, and pHi recovery occurred within 4 minutes and was similar in the 4- and 20- minute ischemia groups. These results indicate that the changes in high-energy phosphates and pHi observed during both 4 and 20 minutes of coronary occlusion are rapidly reversible. The temporal course of metabolic and functional alterations during early ischemia suggests that if these are causally related the decline in contractility is mediated by an increase in inorganic phosphate, a decrease in pHi, or both rather than by loss of ATP.\r"

Feeding rats a diet supplemented with tuna fish oil significantly reduced the incidence and severity of arrhythmias, preventing ventricular fibrillation during both occlusion and reperfusion. Dietary sunflower seed oil reduced arrhythmias during occlusion but not in reperfusion. Dietary fat can modify the vulnerability of the myocardium to arrhythmic stimuli. The efficacy of tuna fish oil in reducing vulnerability to both ischemic and reperfusion arrhythmias suggests a potential beneficial effect of dietary n-3 fatty acids in addition to their influence on hemostasis, plasma lipids, and atherosclerosis that may contribute to their proposed role in lowering cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity.\r"

Although the concordance of overall ventricular tachycardia induction over the 2 days was good (87% of patients), there was variability in the number of extrastimuli needed to induce sustained ventricular tachycardia on each day in 60% of patients. Of those in whom ventricular tachycardia was inducible on both days, 40% required additional extrastimuli and 20% required fewer extrastimuli. A change by two or more extrastimuli was found in 12% of patients. There was no correlation between the variability observed and multiple clinical and laboratory parameters (including the aggressiveness of the stimulation protocol); however, the direction of the variability (easier or harder to induce) correlated with changes in ventricular refractoriness. Inherent day-to-day variability may affect the reproducibility of electrophysiologic studies and influence the results of serial drug testing.\r"

Occasionally magnet application is ineffectual because the ventriculoatrial (VA) synchrony of endless loop tachycardia is converted directly or indirectly to an atrioventricular (AV) desynchronization arrhythmia, another form of VA synchrony. This occurs when a paced ventricular beat engenders an unsensed retrograde P wave and the continual delivery of an ineffectual atrial stimulus during the atrial myocardial refractory period creates self-perpetuating VA synchrony. Upon magnet removal, AV desynchronization arrhythmia reverts immediately to endless loop tachycardia. In the absence of access to programmers, magnet unresponsive endless loop tachycardia can be easily and reliably terminated by chest wall stimulation through inhibition of the ventricular channel of the DDD pulse generator.\r"

Therefore 113 consecutive patients without resting QRS conduction abnormalities referred for Holter monitoring were studied. Four different lead systems were used: a standard bipolar orthogonal lead system and three bipolar lead systems mapping the left ventricle. Measurements made of late potentials included normal and high-frequency QRS duration, their difference, the duration of low-amplitude signals (less than 40 uV) in the terminal QRS, and the root mean square of the last 40 msec of the high-frequency QRS duration. We found that the left ventricular leads tended to give more abnormal measurements than the orthogonal system and that the various measurements failed to agree with each other. In addition, even in this population in which abnormalities of QRS conduction were excluded, the late potential measurements tended to be more abnormal as QRS duration lengthened. These differences in lead systems and measurement criteria must be considered when clinically applying information regarding late potentials measured from the high-frequency ECG.\r"

Mitral regurgitant fraction was greater than 20% in 11 of the 17 patients, and exceeded 40% in four patients. Total stroke volume, calculated from the difference between end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes obtained by two-dimensional echocardiography, correlated well with mitral valve inflow determined by Doppler echocardiography (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001). Similarly, mitral regurgitant volume, calculated as the difference between echocardiographic total stroke volume and forward aortic volume obtained by Doppler echocardiography, correlated well with regurgitant volume calculated as the difference between mitral valve inflow and forward aortic flow, both determined by Doppler echocardiography (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001). Accordingly, functional mitral regurgitation can be conveniently demonstrated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by two different Doppler echocardiography methods, whose results are closely correlated. Mitral regurgitant fraction is greater than 20% in two thirds of the patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated hearts from normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters (160 to 180 days of age) were perfused through the aorta and assessed by echocardiographic and 31P-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) techniques. A decreased left ventricular systolic pressure in cardiomyopathic hamsters was associated with diminished cardiac size and left ventricular wall thickness. However, the ratio of inner/outer cross-sectional area and estimated left ventricular volume at any given left ventricular weight was significantly higher, indicating relative left ventricular chamber enlargement in cardiomyopathic hamsters. Left ventricular volumes were increased with an intraventricular balloon. Gradual inflation of the balloon resulted in increments of left ventricular systolic and developed stress that rose to the same values in both groups. At this point, the normalized stress-strain relationship was approximately two times steeper for cardiomyopathic hamsters, while at lower strain values the diastolic stress in cardiomyopathic hamsters was less than in controls, possibly due to cardiac dilatation. Almost the same degree of dilatation was induced in control hearts by the acute addition of 1% alcohol, but it was not followed by increased diastolic stiffness. Examination of hearts by 31P-NMR techniques revealed a decreased phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi) ratio in the cardiomyopathic hamsters that progressed further with balloon inflation and was associated with a relative fall in PCr and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Results suggest increased diastolic stiffness in cardiomyopathic hamsters, which was not seen in acute cardiac depression with alcohol. Diastolic volume overload with increased wall stress is probably the major factor contributing to increased diastolic stiffness early in the cardiomyopathy.\r"

After multivariate adjustment of these factors, the dark-skinned men had approximately twice the prevalence of both definite and possible LVH-ECG as the lighter skinned men.

The sensitivity and specificity of the three ECG criteria used to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy were: Sokolow-Lyon voltage (S-V1 + R-V5 greater than or equal to 3.5 mV), 65% and 61%; Romhilt-Estes score (greater than or equal to 4), 16% and 84%; and Cornell voltage (R-aVL + S-V3 greater than 2.8 mV in men and greater than 2.0 mV in women), 8% and 95%, respectively. Left ventricular mass, mass index, posterior wall thickness, chamber diameter, and relative wall thickness were not related to any measurement of QRS voltage. Nonvoltage ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy were rare in athletes. Thus hypertrophy is a common but not universal adaptation to exercise. It is only moderately well detected by standard voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy and is not reflected in nonvoltage criteria.\r"

With the use of micromanometer LV pressures and radionuclide LV volumes, pressure-volume (P-V) loops were generated for each loading condition. Then isochronal, instantaneous P-V data points were obtained by linear regression analysis to attain the maximum slope (Emax) of these time-varying isochrones. Other measures of LV end systole were also used to calculate end-systolic P-V relations in a similar fashion, and indirect P-V relations were obtained from the linear regression analysis of brachial artery peak pressure vs minimum LV volume data points. When the slopes of these LV contractile measures were compared to the radionuclide LV EFs, the linear correlation coefficients ranged from 0.53 to 0.67. After natural log transformation of the LV contractile state and EF data, the correlation coefficients for the polynomial curve fits ranged from 0.80 to 0.88. When the correlation coefficients for the polynomial curve fits of the natural log transformed data were compared to those for the linear regression analyses of the raw data, significant improvements were evident (p less than 0.05). Thus the relationship between various measures of LV contractile state and EF obtained with radionuclide angiography is best approximated by a complex, curvilinear relationship that is due, in part, to the wide range of LV contractile states within the relatively narrow normal range of LV ejection fractions.\r"

Although diltiazem induced similar changes in systemic hemodynamics in the two groups, a decrease in anterior coronary vascular resistance (ACVR) and an increase in great cardiac vein flow (GCVF) were observed after administration of diltiazem in all patients in group 1 but in only 6 of 10 patients in group 2 (subgroup 2B). ACVR increased and GCVF decreased after administration of diltiazem in 4 of 10 patients in group 2 (subgroup 2A). Clinico-angiographic characteristics, origin of collaterals, and diltiazem-induced changes in systemic hemodynamics were similar in subgroups 2A and 2B. Thus diltiazem increases coronary flow distal to a stenotic coronary artery but can decrease regional coronary flow and increase regional coronary resistance in a minority of patients with an occluded coronary artery supplied by collaterals, probably through a steal mechanism.\r"

To gain further insight into this phenomenon, we examined the effects of an acute subaortic valvular obstruction on coronary blood flow (CBF) in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs. Transient subaortic obstruction was produced by inflating a catheter-tip balloon in the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract. The degree of obstruction, a 26 +/- 3 mm Hg gradient across the aortic valve, was adjusted to achieve an elevation of LV pressure while maintaining a constant aortic pressure (coronary perfusion pressure). In seven dogs with intact coronary vasomotor tone, systolic left anterior descending CBF decreased from 20 +/- 9 ml/min during the control period to 13 +/- 3 ml/min during subaortic obstruction (p less than 0.001). Diastolic CBF increased from 52 +/- 9 to 58 +/- 10 ml/min (p less than 0.05), and total CBF remained unchanged. In three dogs with maximal coronary vasodilation, systolic CBF decreased during subaortic obstruction, diastolic CBF remained unchanged, and total CBF decreased. The present data suggest that elevation of LV intracavitary pressure above coronary perfusion pressure can reduce systolic CBF and lead to an autoregulatory compensation that taxes coronary flow reserve.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether changes in ECGs correlated with abnormalities in echocardiograms in children with acute and convalescent Kawasaki syndrome, we undertook a retrospective analysis of 44 patients examined during the first 2 weeks of illness and followed for at least 6 months, 31 for longer than 1 year. We analyzed 360 ECGs, 282 echocardiograms, and clinical status. Results of echocardiography showed 18 children with myocardial dysfunction, pericardial effusion, and/or coronary arterial abnormalities (41%); 26 children had no abnormalities. All 18 of the former and all but 10 of the latter had abnormalities on serial ECGs that normalized on recovery. Thirty-four of 44 patients (77%) had ECG abnormalities. These abnormalities were most prevalent in the first month: 68% appeared in the first week, about 50% in the second to fourth weeks, 16% at 2 months, and 10% at 3 months. The type of ECG change did not predict the type of echocardiographic abnormality, except that low voltage of QRS was found only with pericardial effusion. The most frequent early changes were in T waves, which were flattened in 28 (64%). Later 12 patients had high, peaked, abnormal T waves. Prolonged PR interval occurred in 13 patients, seven of whom had echocardiographic abnormalities. Of six with prolonged QT interval, four had abnormal echocardiograms. The possibility of having an abnormal echocardiogram increased with the number of ECG changes: from 0 risk with no change to 37% for one, 47% for two, 80% for three, and 100% for four changes in serial ECGs. Both ECGs and echocardiograms are important in early and subsequent evaluation of these patients. Inasmuch as the ECGs showed abnormalities in 77% whereas echocardiograms showed changes in 41%, we believe that serial ECGs in comparison with prior tracings offer the more sensitive noninvasive indicator of pancarditis in young children during acute and convalescent Kawasaki syndrome.\r"

During a median follow-up interval of 100 months, 14 of these patients had clinical evidence of coronary artery disease consisting of acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or anginal chest pain with angiographic documentation of occlusive coronary artery disease. Baseline variables that were univariately predictive of subsequent clinical coronary disease included age, peak treadmill heart rate, and retinal neovascularization. According to multivariate analysis the peak treadmill heart rate was the single most important predictor of subsequent development of clinical coronary disease. A treadmill ECG result that was either abnormal or inconclusive because of failure to achieve 90% of predicted maximal heart rate identified each patient in whom clinical coronary artery disease developed within 50 months after entry testing. Thus the entry treadmill ECG provided prognostic information not available from the history and physical examination results, but little further prognostic information was provided after the first 50 months of follow-up, suggesting the need for serial testing.\r"

To determine current blood cholesterol treatment attitudes, a survey of 2413 multispecialty Northern California physicians was conducted. A total of 793 physicians responded. Results show that treatment habits among medical specialties are similar with a tendency for lower initial treatment levels in the subspecialties of endocrinology and cardiology. No specialty or subspecialty group indicated an aggressive plasma lipid treatment attitude. The findings include the following: Mean values at which physicians reported treating hypercholesterolemia with medication (312 +/- 44 mg/dl) exceed the NIH definition of \"high risk.\" Younger physicians treated hypercholesterolemia with diet at significantly lower blood cholesterol levels than did older colleagues (p = 0.04). Physicians exposed to the CPPT-LRC investigation did not show a difference in treatment attitudes with regard to blood cholesterol levels when compared to physicians without such an experience. The type of lipid-lowering medication used differs significantly among medical specialties and subspecialties. Physicians lack confidence in the precision of laboratory measurement of plasma lipids. Physician treatment attitudes require substantial change if the NIH cholesterol consensus conference goals are to be achieved.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was designed to derive an accurate pulsed Doppler method of assessing aortic stenosis severity that does not rely on measurement of aortic jet velocity. Left ventricular ET and SV were determined from pulsed Doppler recordings of flow velocity at the aortic anulus in 44 mostly normotensive patients with aortic stenosis. Aortic valve area at catheterization ranged between 0.3 and 2.13 cm2. A predicted ET was derived from Doppler-determined SV with the use of a regression equation previously described by Harley et al. A significant inverse quadratic relation was observed between the ET difference (delta ET), defined as measured ET minus predicted ET, and valve area at catheterization (r = -0.87; valve area = 1.4 - 15 delta ET + 60 delta ET2; SEE = 0.23 cm2). An ET difference of greater than or equal to 0.060 second was 88% sensitive, 89% specific, and 89% accurate for detecting critical aortic stenosis. Thus the ET difference, derived from measurements of SV and ET by pulsed Doppler, is a sensitive index for detection of critical aortic stenosis that is independent of determination of aortic jet velocity. This index should complement the Doppler evaluation of aortic stenosis, especially in cases where interrogation of the stenotic jet with continuous wave Doppler is inadequate.\r"

LV function was evaluated in 18 patients with postinfarction angina based on peak aortic blood acceleration measured noninvasively with a continuous wave Doppler velocimeter. Initial Doppler measurements were made 4 +/- 1 days after infarction and just before PTCA and were repeated 24 to 48 hours after PTCA. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group I (n = 10) had successful PTCA (reperfusion). Group II (n = 8) either had an unsuccessful PTCA or did not undergo PTCA or thrombolytic therapy (no reperfusion). In group I patients, peak acceleration increased from 16 +/- 1 m/s/s just before PTCA to 24 +/- 2 m/s/s 24 to 48 hours after successful PTCA (p less than 0.001). In group II patients, peak acceleration was 17 +/- 2 m/s/s just before PTCA and remained relatively unchanged (18 +/- 2 m/s/s) 24 to 48 hours later. These data indicate that revascularization of coronary arteries in patients with postinfarction angina can elicit considerable improvement of global LV systolic function.\r"

Some combinations of these agents have resulted in an increased frequency of adverse effects. Although nadolol and diltiazem have low incidences of side effects as monotherapy, little is known about their combination. Thus, 18 patients with angina pectoris despite medical therapy were randomly assigned to 3-week periods of nadolol (160 mg/day), diltiazem (240 mg/day) or their combination. At the end of each treatment period, treadmill exercise testing and rest and peak bicycle exercise 2-dimensional echocardiography were performed. The heart rate-systolic blood pressure product was decreased most at peak treadmill exercise with the combination therapy versus monotherapy with either nadolol or diltiazem (12 vs 14 vs 22 x 10(3), respectively, p less than 0.05). Exercise duration did not differ with any of the 3 regimens, but the number of patients without angina during exercise was lowest with the combination therapy versus nadolol or diltiazem alone (5, 10 and 11, respectively, p less than 0.05); similar results were noted with the number of patients developing 1-mm ST depression on the exercise electrocardiogram (6, 10 and 13, respectively, p less than 0.05). The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and during peak exercise was similar among the 3 treatments. The therapeutic combination of nadolol and diltiazem is well tolerated and results in less evidence of myocardial ischemia during exercise than monotherapy with either agent.\r"

Ventricular tachycardia was reproducibly terminated and reinduction temporarily prevented in 8 of the 9 patients by occlusion of the artery or administration of iced isotonic saline. Block in the accessory pathway was obtained in 1 of the 2 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Selective cooling through the atrioventricular nodal artery in 1 patient terminated his circus movement tachycardia. Reproducible termination of a continuous atrial tachycardia was obtained by cooling of the atrial branch supplying the site of origin of the arrhythmia. These data demonstrate the feasibility of identification and selective catheterization of the coronary artery branch supplying blood to an arrhythmogenic area or pathway and suggest a new possibility for treatment of tachycardias by permanently blocking the blood supply to the site of origin or pathway of a tachycardia.\r"

Among the 14 patients with a difference of less than or equal to 10 J between the AICD energy rating and the defibrillation threshold, there were no significant differences between the 4 patients with and the 10 without successful VF termination with respect to the duration of VF induced postoperatively or the AICD lead system. In summary, failure to terminate VF with the AICD is not uncommon (27%) when the defibrillation threshold approaches the energy delivering capacity of the AICD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory recordings were performed before and after sotalol therapy. Fourteen patients underwent baseline electrophysiologic study and sustained VT was inducible in 12. Oral sotalol (320 to 960 mg/day) completely suppressed inducible sustained VT in 7 patients (58%), with modification in 3 (25%). Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed from baseline (mean +/- standard deviation) 431 +/- 616 to 60 +/- 110/hr (p less than 0.03). After a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 7 months, 12 of 14 patients receiving sotalol treatment had successful suppression of ventricular premature complexes (60 +/- 85/hr) and remained clinically free of sustained VT, except 2 who needed additional antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress the recurrent sustained VT. One patient died suddenly after 25 months of sotalol treatment. No severe side effects were noted during sotalol therapy. This study demonstrates that sotalol is a well-tolerated, effective antiarrhythmic agent in patients at high-risk for sudden death. It appears to be beneficial in patients who did not benefit from multiple drug treatment.\r"

The effects of the intravenous and oral administration of verapamil and diltiazem were investigated in 35 patients, 18 with (group I) and 17 without (group II) documented paroxysmal AF. Programmed electrical stimulation, either extra-stimuli or burst atrial pacing, was used to induce AF. In group I, the mean values of the duration of AF before and after the intravenous and oral administration of the calcium antagonists were 31 +/- 12, 112 +/- 49 and 69 +/- 25 minutes, respectively. For group II, the values were 5 +/- 3.4, 39 +/- 13 and 14 +/- 7 minutes, respectively. The differences were statistically highly significant (p less than 0.001), after both oral and intravenous administration compared with the baseline value in both groups. The data suggest that both intravenously and orally administered calcium antagonists enhance sustenance of electrically induced AF, especially in patients with spontaneous arrhythmia. Thus, in patients with paroxysmal AF, verapamil or diltiazem should be administered cautiously, because these drugs may prolong the duration of arrhythmia. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of calcium antagonists in spontaneously occurring paroxysmal AF.\r"

Discontinuous AV nodal conduction curves were observed in 16 patients while supine, but in only 11 patients while upright. Fast pathway refractoriness was shortened: the anterograde fast pathway effective refractory period decreased from 360 +/- 22 to 275 +/- 14 ms (mean +/- standard error of the mean), the anterograde fast pathway block cycle length shortened from 448 +/- 28 to 348 +/- 20 ms and the retrograde fast pathway block cycle length shortened from 425 +/- 29 to 338 +/- 24 ms (all p less than 0.01). The anterograde slow pathway block cycle length shortened from 378 +/- 29 to 316 +/- 17 ms (p less than 0.05). AV nodal reentrant tachycardia was induced in 5 patients while supine (2 sustained, 3 nonsustained) and in 6 patients while upright (4 sustained, 2 nonsustained). Tachycardia cycle length shortened during upright posture, from 413 +/- 30 to 345 +/- 22 ms (p less than 0.01), primarily due to shortened anterograde slow pathway conduction time, from 322 +/- 23 to 268 +/- 20 ms (p less than 0.05). Upright posture thus enhances conduction in patients with dual AV nodal pathways, facilitating AV nodal reentry. Electrophysiologic testing in the upright position may yield additional clinical important information in patients with dual AV nodal pathways.\r"

Blood pressure (BP) was monitored with a mercury gauge sphygmomanometer, while cardiac function and peripheral arterial flows were measured by the noninvasive technique of bioelectric impedance. After a 2-week washout period, patients with a diastolic BP greater than 95 mm Hg but less than 114 mm Hg were randomized into the pindolol (29 patients) or atenolol (28) treatment groups. Patients were treated with 1 of the 2 drugs in an incremental fashion for 12 weeks. Cardiovascular function was measured after the washout period and at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Baseline hemodynamics were similar in both groups. The 2 drugs were equally effective in lowering both systolic and diastolic BP. Hemodynamically, pindolol lowered BP by decreasing total peripheral resistance (-406 +/- 145 dynes.s.cm-5) while atenolol decreased cardiac index (-0.2 +/- 0.1 liters/min/m2) associated with a decrease in heart rate (-12 +/- 2 beats/min). Regarding peripheral vascular beds, pindolol lowered arm vascular resistance (-198 +/- 72 mm Hg/liter/min) and leg vascular resistance (-73 +/- 25 mm Hg/liter/min), especially when subjects who did not respond to pindolol were excluded from the analysis. Both arm (5.5 +/- 5.4% increase above baseline) and leg (1.2 +/- 4.4% increase above baseline) arterial flow indexes were maintained with pindolol. Conversely, atenolol decreased the arm arterial flow index (-9,8 +/- 5.6% decrease below baseline), but not significantly and with no change in resistance (+54 +/- 62 mm Hg/liter/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen patients in severe cardiogenic shock, persisting despite the use of adrenergic agents, were treated with enoximone, a recently available phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Cardiogenic shock was characterized by low cardiac output (less than 2.5 liter.min-1.m-2), elevated pulmonary artery balloon-occluded pressure (greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg), decreased urine output (less than 20 ml.hour-1) and increased blood lactate (greater than or equal to 2.0 mEq.liter-1). Ten patients were mechanically ventilated. A short-term intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg.kg-1 in 20 minutes of enoximone resulted in significant increases in cardiac index (from 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 2.9 +/- 0.3 liter.min-1.m-2, p less than 0.001) and stroke index (from 17.8 +/- 3.3 to 21.9 +/- 5.1 ml.m-2, p less than 0.001) and significant decrease in pulmonary artery balloon-occluded pressure (from 21.7 +/- 5.8 to 19.8 +/- 6.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) without a consistent change in mean arterial pressure (from 79 +/- 8 to 76 +/- 9 mm Hg, difference not significant). Enoximone administration decreased arterial oxygen tension (from 108 +/- 42 to 94 +/- 36 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and increased venous admixture (from 12.8 +/- 6.5 to 16.0 +/- 8.0%, p less than 0.01). In 8 patients, a second infusion of 0.5 mg.kg-1 immediately thereafter amplified these changes. All patients but one survived the episode of cardiogenic shock and 5 patients left the hospital alive. These results indicate that the addition of enoximone to adrenergic agents in the treatment of cardiogenic shock can markedly increase cardiac output and stroke volume without substantial effects on arterial pressure.\r"

There were no significant correlations between valvular thickness and height, weight, heart weight or body surface area. The mean thickness at each site was not different between men and women but increased significantly with age (p less than 0.001). For 3 age groups (less than 20, 20 to 59 and greater than or equal to 60 years), the corresponding mean thicknesses (mm) of the aortic nodule were 0.67, 0.87 and 1.42; those for the anterior mitral leaflet were 1.30, 1.60 and 3.20; and those for the posterior mitral leaflet were 0.91, 1.13 and 2.04. For the aortic valve, the nodule was nearly twice as thick as the closing edge (p less than 0.001), and the closing edge was at least 25% thicker than the middle part (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the posterior aortic cusp was thicker than the right and left cusps (p less than 0.05). For both mitral leaflets, the closing edge was thicker than the clear zone (p less than 0.05). Moreover, along the closing edges, the anterior leaflet was thicker than the posterior leaflet (p less than 0.05). These observations may be useful in echocardiographic evaluations of aortic and mitral valve sclerosis in elderly patients.\r"

Clinical and hemodynamic manifestations at presentation were reviewed from the clinical record. The follow-up period averaged 47 months (range 1 day to 228 months). Actuarial survival rates were 93% at 6 months, 83% at 1 year and 77% at 4 years. Clinical and hemodynamic manifestation included onset at less than 1 year of age (89%), respiratory distress (71%), cardiomegaly on chest roentgenogram (99%), left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T-wave changes on the electrocardiogram (97%) and reduced contractility with dilatation of the left ventricle (100%). Prognostic risk factors were evaluated comparing 13 patients who died (group 1) with 16 patients who survived greater than 4 years (group 2). Only cardiac index (2.8 +/- 0.8 vs 3.5 +/- 0.5 liter/min/m2) and ejection fraction (18 +/- 12 vs 33 +/- 21%) measured at catheterization were significantly reduced in group 1 compared with group 2 (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Careful observation and appropriate management are recommended in all patients, although low ejection fraction and cardiac output at presentation are predictive of poor outcome and support other therapeutic alternatives.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of upright exercise on aortic peak flow acceleration and velocity, 60 normal subjects between 15 and 74 years of age were evaluated by continuous wave Doppler during treadmill stress testing using the Bruce protocol. Subjects were divided into 3 age groups, each with 20 subjects: group 1, 21 +/- 4 years of age (mean +/- standard deviation), group 2, 36 +/- 5 years and group 3, 58 +/- 7 years. Periodic measurements of heart rate, blood pressure and Doppler blood flow velocity and acceleration were made before, during and after exercise. Continuous wave Doppler measurements were recorded from the suprasternal notch. The relation between Doppler aortic measurements and age, gender, normal heart rate and blood pressure responses during exercise, and exercise preconditioning, was evaluated. Age alone was significantly related (inversely) to immediate postexercise Doppler aortic peak blood flow peak acceleration (group 1, 55 +/- 15, group 2, 46 +/- 11 and group 3, 36 +/- 9 m/s2, p less than 0.05) and peak velocity (1.1 +/- 0.2, 1.0 +/- 0.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.2 m/s, respectively, p less than 0.01). Gender, heart rate and blood pressure changes during exercise, as well as preconditioning, had no significant effect on these flow characteristics. Consequently, the effects of normal aging must be considered when using Doppler measurements of peak aortic acceleration and velocity in the evaluation of left ventricular function, e.g., to detect or exclude the presence of coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "The causes of orthostatic intolerance following prolonged bed rest, head-down tilt or exposure to zero gravity are not completely understood. One possible contributing mechanism is increased venous compliance and peripheral venous pooling. The present study attempted to determine what proportion of the increased calf volume during progressive venous occlusion is due to deep venous filling. Deep veins in the leg have little sympathetic innervation and scant vascular smooth muscle, so their compliance may be determined primarily by the surrounding skeletal muscle. If deep veins make a large contribution to total leg venous compliance, then disuse-related changes in skeletal muscle mass and tone could increase leg compliance and lead to decreased orthostatic tolerance. The increase in deep venous volume during progressive venous occlusion at the knee was measured in 6 normal subjects using calf cross-sectional images obtained with magnetic resonance imaging. Conventional plethysmography was used simultaneously to give an independent second measurement of leg volume and monitor the time course of the volume changes. Most of the volume change at all occlusion levels (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mm Hg) could be attributed to deep venous filling (90.2% at 40 mm Hg and 50.6% at 100 mm Hg). It is concluded that a large fraction of the calf volume change during venous occlusion is attributable to filling of the deep venous spaces. This finding supports theories postulating an important role for physiological mechanisms controlling skeletal muscle tone during orthostatic stress.\r"

Neither myocardial blood flow normalized for 100 g muscle tissue nor myocardial oxygen consumption per minute (MVO2) or oxygen supply-demand ratio were different between these 2 groups of patients. When enoximone (1 to 2 mg/kg body weight) was given intravenously in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial oxygen consumption decreased by only 8% (difference not significant), whereas a significant (p less than 0.05) 26% decrease of myocardial oxygen consumption was observed after UDCG-115 (1.25 mg/hour intravenously). However, with both substances the oxygen supply-demand ratio significantly increased from 1.46 +/- 0.10 to 1.57 +/- 0.20 (p less than 0.025; enoximone) and from 1.40 +/- 0.08 to 1.56 +/- 0.19 (p less than 0.05; UDCG-115), respectively. It is concluded from these data that (1) resting coronary hemodynamics related to a unit of myocardium are not different between normal and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and (2) phosphodiesterase inhibitors exert beneficial effects on coronary hemodynamics by improving the oxygen supply-demand ratio.\r"

Exercise conditioning programs have been shown to be an effective means of improving exercise tolerance in many patients with cardiovascular disease. However, improvements can be found without detectable changes in total muscle blood flow during activity. This suggests that peripheral adaptations induced within active muscles by exercise training exert a beneficial influence. These adaptations could include (1) a redistribution of blood flow within the active muscle or limb, or both; (2) an enhanced capillary density within the active muscle; and (3) an increased mitochondrial content within the active muscle. Evaluation of these adaptations, in an animal model of peripheral arterial insufficiency, suggests that all 3 factors potentially serve to enhance exercise tolerance after training. The improved ability of trained muscle to accommodate the metabolic stress during contractions is noteworthy. These factors could contribute to the marked increase in endurance during mild submaximal exercise observed in patients after training.\r"

  ".W": "With physiologic stress to the cardiovascular system, some circulatory compensatory mechanisms are designed to restore homeostasis quickly (e.g., sympathetic nervous system activation and the Frank-Starling mechanism). These compensatory mechanisms are not nearly as effective when there is a chronic pathologic stress such as congestive heart failure (CHF). In this circumstance, other mechanisms that operate with longer time constants come into play (e.g., activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, myocardial hypertrophy and deconditioning). The most successful chronic drug therapies of CHF are those that are designed to reverse the latter group of compensatory mechanisms, a process that is slow. It takes especially long to reverse those CHF-induced changes in blood vessels and skeletal muscle metabolism that are activated to cope with inadequate delivery of oxygenated blood to working muscles. The concept that compensatory mechanisms have either short or long time constants for activation, effectiveness and reversal may help explain why the improvement in exercise tolerance with effective heart failure therapy lags behind hemodynamic improvement.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to produce significant systemic circulatory training effects, including adaptations of the heart, myocardial infarcted (MI) rats were subjected to 2 training regimens: low-intensity endurance training (LIET) and high-intensity endurance training (HIET). When compared with sedentary controls, the MI rats subjected to LIET had small but significant beneficial systemic circulatory training effects exclusive of any training effects on the heart. MI rats subjected to HIET had similar but more extensive and quantitatively greater circulatory adaptations than those found in MI rats subjected to LIET. Unlike LIET MI rats, the HIET MI rats had an increase in maximal heart rate when compared with sedentary MI rats. However, despite the reversal of this chronotropic incompetence, the HIET MI rats did not have significant increases in parameters indicative of increased left ventricular pump function (maximal cardiac output) and maximal stroke volume. To further study the effect of incrementally increasing exercise intensity, a high-intensity sprint training (HIST) regimen was developed and studied in normal rats. In response to HIST, normal rats had central myocardial adaptations (increases in maximal cardiac output and stroke volume) in response to training that were not found in the MI rats subjected to LIET and HIET. Although the effects of HIST in normal rats is now known, the question of whether a training paradigm consisting of HIET and HIST will produce increases in maximal cardiac output and stroke volume in the MI rat has yet to be determined.\r"

Such high blood flows are achieved when only part of the muscle mass is recruited during exercise. With 2 or more limbs exercising, the pump capacity of the heart will limit the blood flow available for the muscles. Norepinephrine spillover from an exercising limb is increased when a small muscle group performs the work, but it appears to have no functional effect on blood flow, and alpha-blocking drugs do not significantly elevate peak blood flow. During whole-body exercise, the norepinephrine spillover becomes further elevated, but the functional significance is not apparent until the oxygen uptake reaches more than 80% of maximal oxygen uptake. At these high work rates the sympathetic discharge overrides the local vasodilator factors and causes vasoconstriction. Thus, blood pressure can be maintained.\r"

In this review, a group of studies performed over the past 3 years aimed at examining these mechanisms further are described. These studies suggest that in CHF, fluid retention has a negative effect on vasodilator capacity, thereby limiting peak forearm blood flow. A second mechanism is described that is slowly reversing and not directly dependent on cardiac function; it is believed that this mechanism may be related to the vascular deconditioning associated with severe CHF. This postulate is based on studies that have shown that peak vasodilator capacity is higher in the trained arms of tennis players, that improved vasodilator capacity can be induced by a localized unilateral training program, and that vasodilator capacity is reduced by localized deconditioning. Furthermore, the level of conditioning on vasodilator capacity may be mediated by chronic changes in blood flow. Further studies are necessary to confirm these relations.\r"

The interpretation of experimental data is complicated by different etiologies of heart failure, drug treatment, exercise protocols, the limitations of methods for the measurement of blood flow and metabolism in intact humans, and by the selection of particular groups of muscles for study that may not reflect changes in other muscles in the body.\r"

Measurements of forearm blood flow at rest or during exercise were not significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. The inorganic phosphate peak was split during exercise in some of the patients, suggesting the presence of more glycolytic fibers in their muscles. These observations suggest that metabolic abnormalities may be present in the skeletal muscles of patients with heart failure that are not due to reduced nutritive blood flow. This may, in part, explain the lack of correlation between measurements of cardiac function and exercise tolerance in these patients.\r"

Group III afferents were more responsive to mechanical stimuli, such as tendon stretch and probing their receptive fields than were group IV afferents. In contrast, group III afferents were less responsive to ischemic contraction than were group IV afferents. Equal percentages of group III and IV afferents were stimulated by potassium, lactic acid and arachidonic acid, each of which are metabolic products of contraction. Adenosine, phosphate and lactate, however, had no effect on the discharge of the afferents. Intrathecal injection of antagonists or antibodies to substance P and somatostatin attenuated the pressor response to contraction by about half, a finding that suggests a role for these 2 peptides in the spinal transmission of the reflex.\r"

The excised pulmonary artery, preincubated with 3H-norepinephrine (NE) was superfused, and stimulated electrically at 2, 4, 8 and 16 Hz. The nonnormalized data at each frequency for electrically evoked 3H overflow in excess of basal outflow was similar in sham and infarct vessels (difference not significant); however, the shape of the frequency-response curves was different. The 3H overflow/pulse from sham vessels was constant between 2 and 16 Hz; however, for the infarct vessels there was a significant reduction (p less than 0.05) at the highest frequency (16 Hz). Because of an 18.4% lower peak 3H overflow at 16 Hz (difference not significant), the infarct frequency-response curve shifted significantly (4 and 8 Hz, p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.01) to the left when data were expressed as a percent of peak percent 3H overflow, suggesting an increased sensitivity of the system. These data suggest that an intrinsic vascular sympathetic nerve abnormality is not a major cause of the increased plasma NE in congestive heart failure; increased nerve activity or decreased clearance of NE may be more important.\r"

Similarly, the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in normal physiology involves volume homeostasis rather than blood pressure control. When a volume deficit occurs, e.g., by restriction of sodium intake or through hemorrhage, a substantial part of the renal vasoconstriction that occurs is due to angiotensin II. In this context, the renal response to congestive heart failure resembles the response to a volume deficit, with angiotensin-mediated renal vasoconstriction contributing to the decrease in blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and to sodium retention. Thus, converting-enzyme inhibition improves renal perfusion and function, including sodium, potassium, magnesium and water handling, as a major part of its therapeutic contribution in congestive heart failure.\r"

This study presents the cumulative experience and data from our laboratories with specific reference to (1) the regional blood flow responses, some rather unique, to various vasodilators and inotropes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), and (2) the pharmacophysiologic conclusions and concepts that have evolved from these data. Certain drugs and drug groups evoke rather consistent changes in the blood flow of certain organ systems in CHF. Renal blood flow is augmented by hydralazine, an effect that persists with chronic administration. The converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, increase renal blood flow; this implies that the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone axis plays a major role in modifying renal blood flow and regional blood flow distribution in human CHF. Nitrates either reduce or do not change renal blood flow. Augmentation of hepatic-splanchnic blood flow occurs after first-dose alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade suggesting that alpha-adrenergic agonism plays an important role in modifying hepatic-splanchnic flow and the regional distribution of cardiac output in CHF. A number of drugs and drug groups increase limb blood flow (e.g., dobutamine, dopexamine, intravenous nitrates, nitroprusside, hydralazine and nifedipine). With respect to regional blood flow and the distribution of cardiac output in CHF, major differences have been shown to exist between drug groups, between drugs within a group and between different doses of a drug. Certain agents can cause a redistribution of systemic flow without changing cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Distinct patterns of flow distribution occur in the muscles during exercise that are related to the fiber-type composition of the muscles or muscle parts (and, presumably, the patterns of fiber recruitment) and the intensity of the exercise. The mechanisms that regulate the differential elevations in blood flow within and among the muscles at the initiation of exercise have not been elucidated.

These studies demonstrate blunted reactive hyperemic responses to brief periods of coronary artery occlusion, and reduced vasodilation in response to adenosine, when the most severe impairment in coronary reserve occurs in the subendocardium. During exercise, in the hypertrophied and failing heart, the normal coronary vasodilator response is also blunted. Although endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratios are depressed in congestive heart failure under baseline conditions, the endocardial/epicardial ratio decreases further with stress, e.g., during either adenosine or reactive hyperemia.

Peak filling rate was significantly lower in group II (1.9 +/- 0.8 vs 2.6 +/- 0.9 end-diastolic counts/s; p less than 0.01). Time to end-systole coefficient of variation, an index of the extent of LV asynchrony, was significantly higher in group II than in group I (43 +/- 10 vs 35 +/- 6; p less than 0.0002). In group I, a highly significant inverse relation was found between this index of asynchrony and peak filling rate (r = 0.71; p less than 0.0001). This correlation was found even when time to end-systole coefficient of variation was normalized to the RR interval (r = 0.49; p less than 0.01) and when peak filling rate was expressed in stroke counts (r = 0.57; p less than 0.001). The correlation between peak filling rate and index of asynchrony was maintained up to an end-systole coefficient of variation value of approximately 35. In group II patients (most with an asynchrony value greater than or equal to 35) no relation was found between time to end-systole coefficient of variation and peak filling rate.\r"

Most patients had poor left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction 29 +/- 12%), multivessel coronary artery disease (71%) and inducible sustained VT with programmed stimulation (87%). During a mean follow-up of 26 months, 36 patients (41%) died and 21 patients had arrhythmia recurrence (with 19 sudden deaths). Factors independently associated with mortality included: (1) treatment before 1981 (p less than 0.01); (2) anterior AMI (p less than 0.05); (3) short time from AMI to first episode of VT (p less than 0.06); and (4) multivessel coronary artery disease (p less than 0.07). Factors independently associated with arrhythmia recurrence were: (1) medical treatment (as opposed to surgical) (p less than 0.01); (2) greater than or equal to 3 episodes of spontaneous VT (p = 0.01); (3) multivessel coronary disease (p less than 0.05); and (4) anterior AMI (p less than 0.07). Medically and surgically treated patients did not differ significantly in overall survival (49 vs 61%, respectively), although short-term (6 month) surgical survival improved from 31% during the first half of the study to 96% in the latter half (p less than 0.01). For patients with sustained VT early after AMI the risk of death and arrhythmia recurrence can be assessed based on clinical and angiographic characteristics; in addition, surgical treatment is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmia recurrence than medical treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean peak CK-MB level was higher in the negative history group after controlling for age, streptokinase administration, previous coronary artery bypass grafting or treatment with beta-blocking agents. Despite the high frequency of healed MI in the positive history group (73%), the rates of in-hospital complications were similar for the 2 groups. Patients with acute MI without previous angina or healed MI have substantially higher peak CK and CK-MB levels; this implies a larger MI than in patients with previous angina or healed MI.\r"

A mathematical model that relates myocardial washout determined using interpolative background subtraction to true myocardial washout is presented. The model was validated using phantoms and applied to myocardial and pulmonary thallium kinetic data in 100 patients, 85 with and 15 without coronary artery disease. The model showed that when using interpolative background subtraction, measured washout equals true washout in normally perfused myocardium; however, depending on the relation between myocardial and pulmonary thallium clearance, myocardial washout in ischemic regions and areas of infarction can be substantially over- or underestimated. Based on generally accepted quantitative criteria, this incorrect washout determination can at times lead to misdiagnosis of infarction as ischemia and ischemia as normally perfused tissue. It can also cause both \"reverse redistribution\" and \"pseudo redistribution\" of thallium in myocardial infarction in the absence of a physiologic basis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which fast Fourier transform analysis of individual ECG leads and of the vector magnitude contribute to the differentiation of patient groups.

Results in group I were used to define normal values for the area and peak magnitude ratios for the individual X, Y and Z leads and for the vector magnitude and to define normal values for the mean XYZ area and peak magnitude ratios. Spectra of the X, Y and Z leads, the vector magnitude and the mean XYZ results were significantly different in patients with VT compared with normal subjects and patients without VT (p less than 0.001). Results were abnormal in multiple leads from 71% of patients with VT and from only 5% of normal subjects (p less than 0.0001). In many patients with VT, abnormalities were identified in 2 of the 3 leads indicating a selective spatial distribution of altered ECG signals that elicit abnormal frequency components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Over the last decade there has been increasing awareness that some cardiovascular medications may adversely affect serum cholesterol concentrations. It has been suggested previously that amiodarone may alter serum cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose concentrations, but no substantive data support this observation. During the course of a 1-year study of adverse effects in patients taking amiodarone, 21 patients with normal total serum cholesterol before entry in the study were prospectively investigated for changes in lipid metabolism. A statistically significant sustained rise of 17% in total serum cholesterol occurred from a baseline of 178 +/- 7 mg/dl (4.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter) to 208 +/- 9 mg/dl (5.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter). Ten of the patients developed elevations of cholesterol above the 75th percentile for their age and sex. This group experienced a sustained rise of 20% in mean cholesterol concentration from baseline, had statistically significant elevations of triglyceride concentrations and had higher glucose and desethylamiodarone concentrations than patients who did not develop elevations in cholesterol greater than the 75th percentile. It may be possible to predict these differences in response as early as 4 to 8 weeks after starting therapy. Because amiodarone is increasingly used in patients without ischemic heart disease or life-threatening arrhythmias, the potential atherogenic risk of these metabolic abnormalities merits further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Transesophageal atrial pacing was used to evaluate the cause of palpitations in 28 patients ages 3 to 18 years (mean 11). Palpitations were defined as the sustained (seconds to minutes) sensation of rapid heart beating. Each patient had had greater than 2 episodes of palpitations. No patient had other evidence of heart disease. Standard electrocardiogram was normal (23 of 28 patients), demonstrated ventricular preexcitation (3 of 28 patients) or demonstrated short PR interval (2 of 28 patients). In selected patients, ambulatory monitoring (11 patients) or exercise testing (3 patients) was performed but failed to demonstrate a cause of palpitations. In an effort to initiate tachycardia, a similar transesophageal atrial pacing protocol was performed in each patient. The protocol consisted of: (1) single extrastimuli at progressively closer intervals during sinus rhythm and after an 8-beat pacing train at greater than or equal to 1 cycle lengths and (2) incremental atrial pacing to the point of second-degree atrioventricular block. If this pacing regimen failed to initiate tachycardia, it was repeated during isoproterenol infusion (0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 micrograms/kg/min) and then following intravenous atropine (0.04 mg/kg) administration. During the study, tachycardia was initiated in 20 of 28 patients (71%) (14 of 15 patients greater than 10 years, 6 of 13 patients less than or equal to 10 years; p less than 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Electrophysiologic characteristics of induced tachycardia suggested reentry within the atrioventricular node (8 of 20 patients) or orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (12 of 20 patients). In 3 of 12 patients with orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia, a transition to atrial fibrillation was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether physiologic doses of epinephrine reverse the electrophysiologic effects of quinidine in patients with an accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. Eighteen patients with an accessory AV connection who had inducible sustained orthodromic tachycardia underwent an electrophysiologic study in the baseline state and after at least 2 days of treatment with 1.4 to 1.9 g/day of quinidine gluconate. The effects of epinephrine were then determined. Epinephrine infusion rates of 25 and 50 ng/kg/min were used in 9 patients each because these doses of epinephrine previously have been demonstrated to result in elevated plasma epinephrine concentrations in the range that occurs during a variety of stresses in humans. Quinidine prolonged refractoriness in the atrium and accessory AV connection and slowed conduction through the accessory AV connection. These effects were partially or completely reversed by epinephrine. Among 8 patients in whom quinidine resulted in orthodromic tachycardia becoming noninducible or nonsustained, sustained tachycardia became inducible again in 5 patients after infusion of epinephrine. After quinidine, atrial fibrillation was either noninducible or nonsustained in 8 patients; however, sustained atrial fibrillation could be induced in 4 of these patients after infusion of epinephrine. The results of this study demonstrate that the therapeutic effect of quinidine in patients who have an accessory AV connection are often reversed by physiologic increases in circulating epinephrine.\r"

Although load-dependent indexes (i.e., ejection fraction, fractional fiber shortening and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening) were similar in the 3 groups, end-systolic wall stress to end-systolic volume index was lower in the moderately obese group (2.63 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.002) and even in the mildly obese group (2.88 +/- 0.8, p less than 0.05) than in the nonobese group (3.27 +/- 0.7). Further, there was a significant inverse relation between end-systolic wall stress to end-systolic volume index and body mass index (r = -0.34, p less than 0.005), diastolic diameter (r = -0.56, p less than 0.001) and left ventricular mass index (r = -0.55, p less than 0.001).

The left ventricular-aortic peak to peak gradient decreased from 72 +/- 25 to 29 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and the aortic valve area increased from 0.52 +/- 0.18 to 0.93 +/- 0.33 cm2 (p less than 0.001). The final aortic valve area was greater than or equal to 1 cm2 in 69 patients (32%). In only 6 cases (3%) the aortic valve area did not change or increased by less than 10%. A clear improvement in the results was observed with gained experience and better catheters. There was 1 death and 1 stroke in the procedure room, and 3 strokes after BAV. Nine patients died shortly after the procedure. There were local complications (hematoma or thrombosis) at the femoral puncture site in 28 (13%) patients.

With exercise, end-diastolic volume index decreased in a stepwise manner from 166 +/- 47 to 152 +/- 41 to 143 +/- 41 ml/m2 at rest, submaximal and maximal exercise, respectively. For the entire group, these changes were not associated with a significant change in ejection fraction but were associated with stepwise increases in systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume index ratio. However, when patients were divided into 3 subgroups based on an increase (group I), minimal change (group II) or a decrease (group III) in ejection fraction from rest to maximal exercise, stepwise increases in systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume index were again observed in groups I and II but not in group III.

Electropharmacologic testing predicted an antiarrhythmic drug effective in 15 of 35 patients in whom sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia could be induced reproducibly (43% of tested patients, 23% of all patients). During median follow-up of 1.6 years, there were 32 arrhythmia recurrences and 24 cardiac arrests. Multivariate regression analysis identified treatment with a drug predicted to be effective at electropharmacologic testing as the only predictor of freedom from arrhythmia recurrence (p = 0.01); and treatment with a drug predicted to be effective at electropharmacologic testing and lower New York Heart Association functional class as independent predictors of freedom from cardiac arrest (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). At median follow-up, the incidences of freedom from arrhythmia recurrence and from cardiac arrest were both 100% during treatment with a drug predicted to be effective at electropharmacologic testing versus 54 +/- 8% and 62 +/- 7%, respectively, during other treatments.

At maximal exercise, heart rate, systemic arterial blood oxygen saturation, cardiac index and stroke volume were significantly reduced in comparison with control values. After the Mustard operation, cardiovascular status at rest may be relatively normal, but during maximal exercise, marked abnormalities occur in nearly all indexes of cardiovascular function. Decreased cardiac output response to exercise is a result of decreased stroke volume response and, to a lesser extent, diminished heart rate.

  ".W": "Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared with standard monoplane left ventriculography in 46 patients with various cardiac diseases. Two different MRI strategies were used. In 28 patients (group 1), ejection fraction was determined using a single slice comparable with the right anterior oblique projection of the ventriculogram. Comparison of left ventricular ejection fraction yielded a poor correlation between single slice MRI (y) and ventriculography (x) (y = 28.7 + 0.47 x, r = 0.65). In 18 patients (group 2), a multiple contiguous slice MRI technique was used to allow ejection fraction and stroke volume determination by summing up the volumes of ventricular cavity intersections. Regression analysis showed a high correlation between multiple slice MRI (y) and ventriculography (x) (y = 7.2 + 0.88 x, r = 0.98). Also, correlation between MRI right (y) and left (x) ventricular stroke volumes was satisfactory, (y = -12.8 + 1.09 x, r = 0.83). It is concluded that the multiple slice imaging technique in MRI provides an accurate noninvasive means for quantification of left ventricular ejection fraction that can be extended to the determination of left ventricular volume.\r"

Mean BMI and skinfold thickness were negatively associated with both education and income. Over the 20-y period mean BMI increased for both white and black women at all levels of income and education. Because the increase in mean BMI was greater at lower educational levels, the differentiation of BMI by educational level increased over time, yielding a stronger negative association. In contrast differentiation of BMI by income category decreased over time. Black-white differences in mean BMI at comparable educational and income levels persisted over this period.\r"

A slight positive association between income level and mean BMI persisted almost unchanged over this period. Mean BMI was similar for black and white men.

The diet provided (as energy) approximately 14% protein, 46% carbohydrate, and 40% fat at a P:S ratio of 0.25. Analysis of breath 13CO2 enrichment on day 3 permitted analysis of background 13C contribution from the test diet alone. On days 4 and 7 either [1-13C]palmitic acid or [16-13C]palmitic acid (9-13.5 mg/kg body wt) was fed with the breakfast meal. The whole-body rate of oxidation of [1-13C]palmitic acid was significantly greater than that observed for [16-13C]palmitic acid.

Because gastric emptying rate was not significantly slowed by a volume of 800 mL, between emptying was probably not a factor in inducing satiety.

The total cellular tocopherol content of saponified samples of fibroblasts or Caco-2 incubated for 4 h with TPGS (4 mumol/L) increased 10-fold without an increase in the free tocopherol content of nonsaponified samples. A 24-h incubation resulted in a free tocopherol content of approximately 20%, suggesting that intracellular hydrolysis of ester bonds had occurred. The increase in total tocopherol content after a 4-h incubation with TPGS was temperature dependent; no change was measurable at 4 degrees C. Addition of metabolic inhibitors during incubation with TPGS at 37 degrees C did not prevent the increase. [14C]TPGS (synthesized from [14C]PEG 1000) was taken up by Caco-2 cells but [14C]PEG 1000 was not.

With an in vivo intestinal loop technique, we examined the absorption of folic acid bound to FBP (FA-FBP) in the small intestine of the suckling rat. In contrast to unbound folic acid (FA), FA-FBP is absorbed more avidly in the ileum than in the jejunum (p less than 0.025) and its absorption is not inhibited by 1 mmol sulfasalazine/L. Folate-binding activities in the mucosa of the proximal (duodenum and jejunum combined) and distal (ileum) small intestine were also examined and found to be 0.32 and 1.31 pmol/mg protein, respectively (p less than 0.001). A 6-h fast produced a 42% decrease in folate-binding activity in the distal small intestine (p less than 0.01) but did not change activity in the proximal portion. Collectively, these observations suggest that FA-FBP is absorbed by a mechanism that is distinct from that responsible for the absorption of FA and that absorption does not require prior dissociation of the vitamin-binding protein complex.\r"

On replenishment of riboflavin, amylase content reverted to that of animals fed ad libitum whereas increases in body weight, pancreas weight, DNA, protein, chymotrypsinogen, and trypsinogen were not statistically significant. Both basal- and bethanechol-stimulated secretions of chymotrypsinogen increased. These data indicate that riboflavin deficiency, which commonly accompanies chronic alcoholism, may contribute to the pancreatic injury in chronic alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate membrane lipid abnormalities and their possible role in copper deficiency anemia, we studied lipids, osmotic fragility, and viscosity of red blood cells (RBCs) of rats fed diets containing 1.1 mg Cu/kg (deficient, Cu-) and 6.0 mg Cu/kg (supplemented, Cu+) at age 3 wk for 9 wk. Data show an increase in cholesterol of 43% and in phospholipids of 38% per cell in Cu- compared with Cu+ rats. Thin-layer chromatography of RBC lipids showed an increased amount of phospholipid-malonyldialdehyde adduct in Cu- (0.70 +/- 0.35% [means +/- SD] of total phospholipids) compared with Cu+ (0.29 +/- 0.19%) rats, suggesting increased membrane lipid peroxidation in Cu- RBC. Osmotic fragility of RBCs from Cu- rats was lower. RBC viscosity was significantly higher in Cu- than in Cu+ rats at shear rates of 23, 11.5, and 5.75 shear/s and was similar at shear rates 115 and 46 shear/s. Increased cell viscosity caused by lipid loading and crosslinking of membrane components caused by lipid peroxidation may have a role in the reduced RBC survival and anemia in Cu deficiency.\r"

Group 1 (n = 12) and group 2 (n = 10) were intact male rats; group 1 received a dietary Fe supplement whereas group 2 received no Fe supplement. Group 3 (n = 12) and group 4 (n = 12) were castrated male rats; group 3 received a dietary Fe supplement whereas group 4 received no supplement. Analysis of circulating hormone values revealed that after 6 wk of dietary treatment, neither LH nor testosterone levels were affected by the Fe-deficient diet in either the castrated or intact groups. These observations suggest that neither testosterone secretion per se nor its feedback control by LH is affected by short-term Fe deficiency.\r"

Groups had similar income, education, prenatal care, age, parity, weight, height, pregnancy weight gain, prenatal iron supplementation, energy, protein, Fe, and vitamin C intake and infant sex and gestational age. Maternal hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) at 8 mo gestation, cord blood Hb and Hct, infant birth weight and Hb and Hct at 1 mo of age, and breast-milk Fe concentration were significantly lower in the coffee group than in the noncoffee group. The association of coffee with infant Hb and Hct was independent of maternal Fe status and birth weight. These results are consistent with our previously reported data in rats and indicate that maternal coffee intake may contribute to maternal and infant anemia.\r"

A statistical difference was found between term and preterm milk at 3-5 d of lactation. During lactation significant changes were found between the periods 3-5 d and 7-10 d, 14 d, 1 mo (p less than 0.01) and 2 mo (p less than 0.05) of lactation and between 7-10 d and 14 d (p less than 0.05). According to the requirements of the preterm infant, a supplementation of 2-3 micrograms.kg-1.d-1 by enteral route is suggested.\r"

Plasma Zn was significantly increased only in the 100 mg Zn group. Zn concentrations in erythrocytes, platelets, mononuclear cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were not significantly increased by any treatment. None of the treatments significantly altered delayed dermal hypersensitivity (DDH) to a panel of seven recall antigens or in vitro lymphocyte proliferative responses (LPR) to mitogens and antigens. Fifteen subjects had initially poor lymphocyte proliferative responses that improved in 14 of these individuals during the study; this was not due to Zn supplementation but might have been caused by one or more components of a vitamin-mineral supplement administered to all study subjects.\r"
