A set of fluorescent analogues of a very tight binding inhibitor (dissociation constant of 200 picomolar) of calmodulin has been synthesized. The fluorescent amino acid tryptophan has been systematically moved throughout the sequence of this peptide. The fluorescence properties for the peptides repeat every three to four residues and are consistent with the periodicity observed for an alpha-helix.\r"

They included the detailed shape of the protein and an accurate description of its electrostatic potential. Application of the method to the diffusion of the superoxide anion to the protein superoxide dismutase revealed that the electric field of the enzyme enhances the association rate of the anion by a factor of 30 or more. Calculated changes in the association rate as a function of ionic strength and amino acid modification paralleled the observed behavior. Design principles of superoxide dismutase are considered with respect to insights provided by the simulations. A possible means of enhancing the enzyme turnover rate through site-directed mutagenesis is proposed.\r"

The field strength dependence of electric field modulation of proline incorporation into extracellular and intracellular protein was measured over a frequency range from 0.1 to 1000 hertz. A frequency- and amplitude-dependent reduction in the rate of incorporation was observed. In tissues containing cells aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the electric field, this response was dependent on the orientation of the cells relative to the direction of the applied electric field. This study demonstrates that currents of physiological strength can stimulate alterations in biosynthesis and thereby may influence tissue growth, remodeling, and repair.\r"

Enzymes may have been recruited several times as lens proteins, perhaps because of the developmental history of the tissue or simply because of evolutionary pragmatism (the selection of existing stable structures for a new structural role).\r"

The method involves detection of the disease locus by virtue of the fact that the adjacent region will preferentially be homozygous by descent in such inbred children. A single affected child of a first-cousin marriage is shown to contain the same total information about linkage as a nuclear family with three affected children. Calculations show that it should be practical to map a recessive disease gene by studying DNA from fewer than a dozen unrelated, affected inbred children, given a complete RFLP linkage map. The method should make it possible to map many recessive diseases for which it is impractical or impossible to collect adequate numbers of families with multiple affected offspring.\r"

The source of dietary protein (ie, animal or vegetable) does not seem to affect birth weight, as long as vegans are health conscious, receive continuous prenatal care, supplement their diets with prenatal vitamins, calcium, and iron, and apply protein-complementing nutritional principles. Preeclampsia may be caused by a relative prostacyclin deficiency in the face of excessive production of thromboxane A2. A vegan diet (one low in arachidonic acid) might provide protection against this condition, especially if the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid is inhibited by decreased activity of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase. We examined the maternity care records of 775 vegan mothers for symptoms of preeclampsia, and only one case met the clinical criteria. Since preeclampsia in our culture is frequently associated with unrestrained consumption of \"fast foods\" (foods having high levels of saturated fat) and rapid weight gain, it is possible that a vegan diet could alleviate most, if not all, of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia.\r"

Furthermore, the exogenous administration of human chorionic gonadotropin failed to elicit a normal response from the male gonads of hemodialyzed patients. Although basal serum prolactin levels are elevated, we do not believe that elevation is of the magnitude expected to produce testicular failure. Thus we believe that the primary testicular failure is part of the uremic syndrome, and is not corrected by dialysis.\r"

Benign disease was diagnosed in 345 patients (232 with benign nodular goiter, 98 with lymphocytic thyroiditis, three with granulomatous thyroiditis, and 12 with cysts). Neoplasm was diagnosed in 81 patients (61 with follicular neoplasm, 12 with papillary carcinoma, three with medullary carcinoma, three with anaplastic carcinoma, one with metastatic carcinoma, and one with lymphoma). Of the 43 patients who later proved to have cancer, 24 had follicular carcinoma, 12 papillary carcinoma, one medullary carcinoma, three anaplastic carcinoma, one metastatic carcinoma, and two lymphoma. (Eight patients refused surgery or were operated upon elsewhere and lost to follow-up.) Cancer was found in 54% of patients sent to surgery. Follicular carcinoma cannot presently be separated from follicular adenoma by needle biopsy, and surgery will continue to be required in these patients (14%); however, thyroid biopsy greatly decreased the need for surgery in other patients. Erroneous diagnoses, mainly due to inexperience, decreased after the first year. A multidisciplinary approach involving the thyroidologist and cytopathologist is important, as is the close clinical follow-up of patients with nodules thought to be benign. The safety of needle biopsy, its low cost, and the accuracy of the procedure when compared to other clinical tests for thyroid nodules make it well worth the effort to make this test more widely available.\r"

During a 12-month period at the Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center, we isolated C jejuni from 3.4% of the 290 stool cultures from patients with diarrhea. This compared to an isolation rate of 4.1% for Salmonella and 3.1% for Shigella. During the same period, 17 additional cases of Campylobacter-associated diarrhea were identified in adults at the two other Baylor College of Medicine teaching hospitals. We correlated the clinical history, treatment, and outcome of these 27 cases of Campylobacter-associated diarrhea (22 cases of acute diarrhea and five of chronic diarrhea). In most patients with acute disease, the diarrhea was resolving by the time the results of the cultures were available. The duration of illness was the same whether treated with antibiotics to which Campylobacter was susceptible (effective therapy) or antibiotics to which it was not susceptible (ineffective therapy); the mean duration of diarrhea after submitting the culture was 5.2 days for those with ineffective therapy versus 5.6 days for those receiving effective therapy. Thus, antibiotic therapy did not appear to shorten the duration of acute diarrhea due to Campylobacter. Five patients had chronic diarrhea; all had an unrelated underlying disease, and antibiotic treatment did not change the clinical course despite bacteriologic cure. This study raises questions as to the value of antibiotic therapy for campylobacteriosis, and in this light, we discuss the value of routine culturing for Campylobacter.\r"

Predominant symptoms were fever and sore throat (by case definition), headache (83%), abdominal pain (64%), and conjunctivitis (51%). At least 77 persons were identified whose symptoms met the case definition for illness. Onsets of illness peaked during the week of July 5 to 12, and the outbreak resolved within three weeks. A systematic telephone survey of the town revealed that persons who had swum at the community swimming pool were more likely to be ill than those who had not (P less than .001). A second survey of families with season passes to the pool showed that among swimmers, illness was directly related to average number of hours of exposure to the pool each week (P less than .001 by chi-square for trend). In addition, swimmers who reported swallowing pool water were more likely to be ill (29 of 56, 52%) than persons who did not (ten of 41, 24%) (P = .01). Throat-swab specimens from five of seven ill persons (71%) grew adenovirus 7a compared with one of 12 well persons (8%) (P = .01). The pool chlorinator had reportedly malfunctioned during early July. The outbreak resolved with proper operation of the chlorination system. Swimming pools continue to be a potential source of community-wide outbreaks of adenovirus infections.\r"

We reviewed 108 procedures involving tube thoracostomy and tetracycline pleurodesis, and report a success rate of 94.4% without serious complications. Considering all patients, 49% were symptom-free at three months, and 13% were alive one year later. Several potentially important changes in technique have emerged since the initial description of this procedure. With adherence to meticulous technique, tetracycline pleurodesis provides rapid, effective, and safe palliation of malignant pleural effusions.\r"

All study subjects were healthy men with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from a linear regression analysis of the terminal log-linear portion of the log serum theophylline concentration-time curves. The terminal elimination kinetics of theophylline in this study were best characterized by first order elimination from a one compartment-open model. A statistically significant difference (P less than .05) was demonstrated between the means and variances of theophylline clearance (Cl ml/kg/min) and hours of half-life (t1/2) for control subjects and smoking tetraplegics. Total body clearance of theophylline was greater in all tetraplegic subjects, the greatest difference in total clearance of theophylline adjusted to body weight being observed between tetraplegic smokers and nonsmoking controls with an intact central nervous system (P less than .05). Theophylline volume of distribution (Vdarea) did not differ significantly from Vdarea in able-bodied subjects. Tetraplegic individuals have multiple disorders and marked pharmacokinetic variation, which might be expected to make serum concentration and toxicity of theophylline unpredictable using population averages.\r"

A single 400 mg oral dose of ketoconazole caused a decrease in serum cortisol concentration, while the concentration of 11-deoxycortisol and its ratio to cortisol increased. The decrease in serum cortisol levels was not accompanied by an increase in plasma ACTH concentration. A four-hour continuous infusion of ACTH resulted in an appropriate elevation of serum cortisol, but with a marked increase in serum concentration of 11-deoxycortisol and its ratio to serum cortisol. We conclude that 400 mg of ketoconazole can decrease cortisol synthesis apparently through a partial block of the 11-beta-hydroxylation step; the observed degree of inhibition may not be sufficient to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or to cause overt symptoms or signs of adrenal insufficiency; and this partial block of the 11-beta-hydroxylation step becomes more evident during a continuous infusion of ACTH, which can stimulate a normal response of cortisol.\r"

The study group consisted of 409 patients (213 medical, 196 surgical) whose pH value was greater than 7.48; 253 of these patients (61.9%) had pure respiratory alkalosis, 120 (29.3%) had mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, 27 (6.6%) had a mixed acid base disorder, and nine (2.2%) had pure metabolic alkalosis. Overall group mortality was 27.9% and increased as pH values rose, reaching 48.5% when the pH was greater than 7.60. The overall mortality among medical patients (36.6%) exceeded that among the surgical patients (12.4%) (P less than .05), an observation that applied over a wide range of pH values. Patients having mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis had a significantly poorer outcome (44.2% mortality) than the alkalemic group as a whole (27.9% mortality) (P less than .05). Alkalemia-associated illnesses are common in hospitalized patients and are associated with high mortality in both medical and surgical patients, though the death rate is higher among medical patients. Mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis appears to be associated with a particularly poor prognosis.\r"

Through the management of this trust, a 25,000 square foot regional child health center facility was constructed and has been in operation for approximately seven years. Health services to children have increased enormously, and we describe the program in some detail.\r"

The physician-patient interaction was scored according to predetermined criteria. There was no significant difference in interns' performance whether or not the preceding 24 hours had been spent on call. On a standardized questionnaire, interns reported significantly more fatigue and depression after call. We conclude that the major discernible effect of call is a deterioration of interns' feelings of well-being.\r"

While the use of ipecac is both efficacious and safe in the overwhelming majority of cases, there have been documented fatalities after appropriate doses. For this reason, ongoing education for physicians is important; education of parents is also warranted since wide-scale distribution to families is the accepted standard. Because most patients stop vomiting within two to three hours after ipecac administration, we recommend that children with persistent vomiting should be observed in a medical facility, where electrolyte levels can be measured and fluids can be replaced if necessary.\r"

Several investigators have suggested that asymptomatic patients have stronger trunk muscles than patients with low-back pain. People who are physically fit appear to have a decreased incidence of low-back pain. Increased trunk muscle endurance also have been observed to decrease the incidence of low-back pain. The objective evaluation of the strength and endurance of trunk musculature may, therefore, be significant. Part 1 of this study was designed to develop a reproducible strength-endurance screening procedure and to establish normal isometric-isokinetic trunk muscle strength and endurance parameters for women. This study showed that isometric trunk flexion varied from 19-109 Nm and trunk extension from 38-168 Nm. Peak values for isokinetic trunk flexion at two speeds (30 degrees per second and 60 degrees per second) varied from 17-191 Nm and isokinetic trunk extension from 14-208 Nm. The average endurance time for trunk extensors tested with the Sorensen test was 196 seconds.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have shown positive correlations between muscle strength, flexibility, and the frequency of low-back pain. Weak trunk musculature and decreased endurance have thereby come to be identified as significant risk factors in the development of occupational back problems. Because it is widely accepted that exercise plays an important role in the conservative treatment and prevention of low-back pain, the goals of most rehabilitative programs involves improving the strength and endurance of the low-back pain patient. Whereas electrical stimulation has been shown to increase the muscle strength of the lower extremities, this effect has not been demonstrated for the trunk muscles. Part 2 is a prospective controlled study designed to document and to compare objectively the effects of electrical stimulation and exercise on trunk muscle strength. A total of 117 healthy women were divided randomly into four groups. Two groups received electrical stimulation with different electrical parameters, one group received exercises, and one group acted as a control group. The results showed that low-frequency electrical stimulation and exercises significantly (P less than .05) increased isokinetic back-muscle strength compared to the control and medium-high-frequency electrical stimulation groups. Both types of electrical stimulation, however, significantly increased (P less than .05) the endurance in the back muscles compared with the control and the exercise groups. This study showed that electrical stimulation may be a valuable treatment in the early care of low-back pain patients in maintaining and increasing strength and endurance of back muscles when a more active exercise program is too painful to perform.\r"

Lateral spot radiography showed an anteroposterior translatory movement of 5 mm or more in 24 of 45 patients with lytic spondylolisthesis of L5, in all of 7 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis of L4, and in 37 of 65 patients with a retro-olisthetic displacement of L3, L4, or L5. In cases of spondyl- and retro-olisthetic instability the upper vertebra moved posteriorly during traction and anteriorly during compression. Severity of low-back pain (LBP) symptoms did not show any correlation with the degree of the maximal displacement but correlated significantly with the amount of instability both in the case of spondyl- and retro-olisthesis. Traction-compression radiography proved a simple and practical method to diagnose and measure translatory segmental instability even when conventional flexion-extension load failed to provoke any abnormal movement (eg, in the case of spondylolisthesis).\r"

The results showed that the range of movement increased by 5 degrees during the day. In the second experiment, cadaveric lumbar motion segments were creep loaded to simulate a day's activity and their bending properties were measured before and after creep. The results showed that creep loading reduces the spine's resistance to bending (the effect being particularly marked in the disc) and increases the range of lumbar flexion by 12.5 degrees. The results of the two experiments were combined to show that in life, forward bending movements subject the lumbar spine to higher bending stresses in the early morning compared with later in the day. The increase is about 300% for the discs and 80% for the ligaments of the neural arch. It is concluded that lumbar discs and ligaments are at greater risk of injury in the early morning.\r"

Lumbar flexion moments were lowest when the workers used the lordotic and straight back postures, while the average erector spinae muscle activity tended to be highest in the lordotic and straight back postures. The kypohotic posture regularly reduced the activity of the erector spinae to bursts of activity while lifting and caused more discomfort during the lifting tasks than any other posture. Therefore, the lumbar lordotic posture is recommended as the posture of choice while lifting, particularly when lifting from the floor level.\r"

The loads on L3 in the lifters ranged between 18.8 and 36.4 kN. The BMC values were extremely high and closely correlated to the amount of weight lifted during training (r2 = 0.82). The study showed that intensive training will increase the BMC to an extent that the spine can tolerate extraordinary loads.\r"

Fresh human cadaveric ligamentous spine segments (T12-sacrum) were potted and clinically relevant loads applied through the loading frame attached to the topmost vertebra of the specimen. The resulting three-dimensional motion responses of each vertebra for the normal specimen were recorded with the Selspot II System. The specimen was injured at the L4-5 motion segment to represent a typical surgical decompression used in treating patients with spinal stenosis and tested again. The decompressed (or injured) motion segment was stabilized with a Luque closed-loop (Luque rectangle) system before repeating the test protocol. The data of these tests indicate that the injury (surgical decompression) at the L4-5 motion segment leads to a significant increase in motion--in flexion, extension, and axial modes--indicating the possible necessity for stabilization of the injured segment. The closed-loop system reduces the motion at the injured level, with respect to normal specimen behavior, by 35%. Therefore, the system does not provide complete immobilization (100% reduction with respect to normal specimen behavior). The stabilizing effects of the closed loop in lateral bending are not significant and are marginal in axial motion. The motion across the L3-4 motion segment in flexion increases significantly after stabilization. The clinical implications and the need for further studies are also discussed.\r"

The widest pedicles in the sagittal plane were seen at T11, the narrowest at T1. Due to the oval shape of the pedicle, the sagittal plane width was generally larger than the transverse plane width. The largest pedicle angle in the transverse plane was at L5. The posterolateral to anterolateral pedicle axis orientation in the transverse plane, seen at other levels throughout the thoracolumbar spine, reversed at T12. In the sagittal plane, the pedicles angled caudally at L5 and cephaladly from L3-T1. The depth to the anterior cortex was significantly longer along the pedicle axis than along a line parallel to the midline of the vertebral body at all levels with the exception of T12 and T11.\r"

Of the patients with odontoid fractures, 1 patient had an incomplete tetraparesis. All patients except 1 were treated within the first day after the trauma. A total of 50% were injured in motor vehicle accidents. The odontoid fracture was reduced by skull traction and then stabilized with a halo-vest for 12 weeks. One patient died within the first 2 weeks after the injury. There were no other serious complications during the treatment. The initial dislocation and reduction was studied. Ten patients were followed-up after 2 years. Another 2 patients died of other causes during that time. One had an Anderson-d'Alonzo Type II fracture that failed to unite. Different prognostic factors were analyzed. Fracture gap and fracture type may have contributed to nonunion. Only 1 patient was totally free from symptoms after 2 years. The halo-vest was well tolerated in all patients and assured a high percentage of healing.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen upper cervical spine specimens were dissected to examine the macroscopic and functional anatomy of alar ligaments. They are on both sides, symmetrically placed, approximately 10-13 mm long and elliptical in cross-section 3 X 6 mm in diameter. The fiber orientation is dependent on the height of dens axis, mostly in the cranial caudal direction. In 12 specimens there was a ligamentous connection between dens and lateral mass of the atlas as a part of the alar ligament. In 2 specimens anterior atlanto-dental ligament was identified. The computerized tomographic (CT) images can clearly show alar ligaments in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. The ligaments limit the axial rotation in the occipito-atlanto-axial complex (to the right by left alar and vice versa) as well as in side bending. The ligament is most stretched, and consequently most vulnerable, when the head is rotated and in addition flexed. This mechanism, common in whiplash injuries, could lead to irreversible overstretching or rupture of the ligaments especially as the ligaments consist of mainly collagen fibers.\r"

Phase 1, Personnel Program, was designed to decrease the duration of wage-loss claims by increasing the effectiveness of the existing procedures used to process these claims. This program significantly lowered the proportion of high-hour claims (P less than .05) and significantly reversed a trend of increasing accident rates (P less than .05). Phase 2, Back Program, was designed to lower the incidence of back injuries through a feedback-oriented educational program. The Back Program itself could not demonstrate a significant reduction in back injuries primarily due to the powerful and confounding effect of the Personnel Program. The combination of the Personnel Program and the Back Program significantly lowered back injuries for nurses when compared with a similar group of injuries that occurred at geriatric hospitals (P less than .001). The large effect of the Personnel Program and the small effect of the Back Program have design implications for any injury prevention program.\r"

Fibrinolysis was significantly impaired in the back pain patients as a whole compared with matched controls. Similar changes were observed in all the different back pain syndromes. In the smaller subgroups, these did not reach significance but were significant in spondylosis, proven arachnoiditis, and nonspecific back pain.

They had a lumbar arthrodesis at the third lumbar level or below and their operations were performed before 1964. Twenty-four were not located and 8 were deceased. Sixty-two subjects (72% of available sample) completed a telephone interview; 52 subjects completed a comprehensive low back questionnaire; and 33 subjects returned for physical examination, flexion-extension lateral lumbar spine films, and a limited computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scan. In general, the subjects who returned for complete evaluation were representative of the larger sample. Forty of 62 patients were men. Ages ranged from 41 to 83 years; the median age was 66 years, 6 months. Follow-up ranged from 21 to 52 years; the median follow-up was 33 years. Forty-four percent (27/61) were currently experiencing low-back pain, 57% (35/61) had back pain in the last year. Fifty-three percent (33/62) were using medication. Fifteen percent (9/62) had undergone repeat lumbar surgery, however, only 5% (3/62) required surgery as a late sequela (more than 10 years postoperatively). Forty-two percent (14/33) had lumbar spinal stenosis, but only 15% (5/33) had dural tube measurements less than 100 mm2. Segmental instability above the fusion was present in 45% (15/33). There was a significant correlation between segmental instability and lumbar spinal stenosis (r = .57, P less than .01). Neither radiographic condition correlated with symptoms, however.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The range of rotation was measured from CT images after maximal rotations to both sides. The left alar ligament was then cut and the examination repeated. The alar and transverse ligaments could be differentiated on CT images in axial, sagittal, and coronal views. Rotation at occiput-atlas was 4.35 degrees to the right and 5.9 degrees to the left and at atlas-axis it was 31.4 degrees to the right and 33 degrees to the left. After one-sided lesion of the alar ligament, there was an overall increase of 10.8 degrees or 30% of original rotation to the opposite side, divided about equally between the occiput-atlas and the atlas-axis. It is concluded that a lesion (irreversible overstretching or rupture of alar ligaments) can result in rotatory hypermobility or instability of the upper cervical spine.\r"

Each patient complained of pain and paresis in one leg. Neurologic examination demonstrated dysfunction of not only both long tracts but also lower motor modalities in the symptomatic leg and no abnormalities in the opposite leg. These findings, therefore, would strongly suggest that each leg was supplied by one of the split spinal cords, with only one cord being compromised. When planning surgical intervention on these patients, one must be aware that removal of the central spur alone may not resolve the problem because the spur, unlike that in diastematomyelia, does not tether the split spinal cords.\r"

In addition, a questionnaire comparing the comfort of the two chairs was completed at the end of the study session. Comfort ratings showed an overall preference for the conventional chair. Increased cervical (P = .004) and lumbar muscle EMG measurements were noted after sitting in the Balans chair. Pedal cutaneous blood flow was increased by 15% in the Balans chair (P = .001). The data do not support the manufacturer's claim that the Balans chair is likely to decrease complaints of LBP.\r"

No stable regression equation was found for the prediction of the moment arm of the rectus abdominis, and the results indicated that the method was group dependent. These findings have implications for human modeling studies that use estimated parameters for the internal muscle variables.\r"

Thirty-nine discs also were evaluated after discography with roentgenographic CT MRI findings were compared with discography results. MRI was 99% accurate in predicting normality or abnormality as determined by discography. Changes in disc signal on MRI accurately reflected the presence or absence of degenerative changes seen on discography in patients with low-back pain. Clinically, MRI is a useful technique for detecting early disc degeneration and for assessing the affected disc level and adjacent levels in patients with low-back pain and spondylolithesis.\r"

One hundred and eight patients with chronic low-back syndrome were evaluated. Patients had not previously had pathology identified which could explain their pain. On discography, 83 patients (78%) had their pain reproduced at least one abnormal level, identifying a structural component to their pain. Only 22 patients (21%) had all levels of pathology identified by roentgenograms and an additional 17 (16%) had pathology appropriately identified by a combination of myelograms and roentgenograms. Using roentgenograms, myelography, and discography, organic pathology was identified which could explain the patient's symptoms in 100 of 108 patients (93%). Based on this study, we think discography is an important diagnostic tool for use in evaluating patients with chronic low-back syndrome. Discography is essential to adequately identify abnormal levels in patients being considered for fusions. Roentgenograms and myelograms are inadequate evaluation in this chronic pain group in that lack of organic pathology cannot be assumed in the presence of normal roentgenograms and myelograms.\r"

Degeneration and annular disruption were regarded as separate phenomena. Additionally, provoked pain response, contrast volume, and miscellaneous information were recorded. Discogram findings of 59 patients with low-back and/or leg pain were graded according to the new method and compared with standard methods using routine anteroposterior and lateral discographic images. Findings from routine discography and CT/discography were graded and correlated with myelographic and plain computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans. This study demonstrated that the contrast-enhanced axial view provided by CT/discography served as a useful projection for demonstrating disc pathology. CT/discography analyzed according to DDD offered a more sensitive discriminator of disc degeneration from annular disruption (disc protrusion/leaking). This evaluation can be recommended as the procedure of choice when revision of spine surgery is considered or when there is an equivocal or negative correlation between clinical information and myelography or CAT scan.\r"

The radiographic appearance of disc deterioration demonstrating disc degeneration and annular disruption of each disc was classified separately using a fourpoint scale: normal, slight, moderate, or severe. Pain reaction to the discogram at each level was recorded as follows: no pain, dissimilar pain, similar pain, or exact reproduction of the patient's clinical pain. This more precise analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between pain and deterioration of discs. The CT/discogram presents an axial view of the disc that allows a subgrouping of disc deterioration that can discriminate between peripheral deterioration (degeneration) and internal deterioration (disruption). The disruption supposedly occurs earlier and is more likely to be the source of exact pain reproduction.\r"

From these three views, a new classification for interpreting discograms was developed. The correlations between the three different views were good, confirming the potential value of CT axial views. However, in one fourth of the discs there were pathologic anatomic findings that could be seen only in the axial views. There were more severe osteoarthritic changes in the right than the left facet joint, and a discrepancy between facet arthritis and disc disease was also noted.\r"

Only when disabling subjective and intractable objective complications persist after good medical treatment should surgical intervention be considered. Various antireflux procedures are currently available and all can be effective. Surgeons should review their own experiences and make alterations that they perceive will correct the types of problems encountered. In our current technique for the surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in the common clinical setting, normal esophageal peristalsis is present, the fundus is adequate for plication, and sufficient esophageal mobilization can be effected to permit reduction of the entire stomach and fundoplication below the diaphragm. In addition, the procedure should be restricted to patients who do not have stenosis or have stenosis that can be readily dilated to 50 French.\r"

Long-term follow-up of 26 patients (81 per cent of survivors) after a mean +/- SEM of 8.4 +/- 1.1 years showed that 73 per cent of patients had no or only occasional, easily controlled, mild abdominal symptoms and good enough health to enable them to work or carry out normal activities for their age. The patients lost a mean of 15 per cent of their body weight, however, and about one third of them had weakness and diarrhea. A quarter of them had anemia despite iron and vitamin B12 therapy. Our conclusion was that total gastrectomy is a reasonable operation for benign diseases. Nonetheless, in view of the substantial postoperative mortality and morbidity, the operation should be used only when less extensive operations will not suffice.\r"

The findings included splenic vein thrombosis in 11 patients, splanchnic arterial anomaly or occlusion in ten patients and arterial pseudoaneurysm in six patients. Disease duration and presence of associated splenic vein thrombosis were the only two significant predictors of pseudoaneurysm. The presence of a pseudocyst was not predictive. Gastroesophageal varices, splenomegaly, associated arterial pseudoaneurysm and chronic pancreatic disease were significant predictors of splenic vein thrombosis. Dynamic bolus computed tomography was 100 per cent sensitive in detecting arterial pseudoaneurysm and 71 per cent in detecting splenic vein thrombosis. Eight patients with splenic vein thrombosis underwent splenectomy and the remaining three patients have been observed without splenectomy. Variceal bleeding has not occurred in either group. Five of the six patients with arterial pseudoaneurysm underwent aneurysmectomy without operative mortality. We conclude that arterial and venous complications of pancreatitis are associated with long duration of disease, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, varices and splenomegaly. Dynamic bolus computed tomography will detect vascular complications in these high risk patients. In patients with chronic pancreatitis in whom an operation is indicated, preoperative knowledge of vascular abnormalities may change the planned operative approach.\r"

The treatment strategy was always guided by the clinical impression of the physician. If the results of a suspected mass were negative on FNAC, biopsy was performed and histologic study gave the final diagnosis. There were no false-positive results and only 6 per cent were false-negative findings diagnosed later by open biopsy. The over-all accuracy rate was 90 per cent plus 4 per cent diagnosed on cytologic examination as \"suspicious\" and which proved to be malignant. Based upon our accumulated results, simplicity of performing the test, its low cost, the extremely low morbidity, the immediate response and, above all, an over-all high accuracy rate, we conclude that FNAC is a highly recommended method for the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast.\r"

Additionally, the plasma hydrocortisone level is extremely elevated. Since administration of hydrocortisone to normal humans also produces a specific decrease in T X mu or T4 lymphocytes, it was hypothesized that burn induced elevations of hydrocortisone were responsible for the decrease in T X mu/T4 cells. In this study, normal humans were administered constant infusions of hydrocortisone for six hours, such that plasma levels were increased to an extent that mimics those 24 to 48 hours after thermal injury. Before, during and after infusion, percentages and numbers of lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and T3, T4, T8, T11, HLA-DR and Leu7 lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry. Results were compared with those for patients with burns. The plasma hydrocortisone level rose to 49.0 micrograms per deciliter during infusion, similar to the mean of 47.5 micrograms per deciliter for patients with burns. Infused volunteers showed significant lymphopenia, monocytopenia and granulocytosis. Additionally, there were significant decreases in percentages of T3, T4 and T11 lymphocytes, no significant changes in percentages of T8 or HLA-DR and an increase in percentages of Leu7+ cells. These changes in lymphocyte subsets mimicked those of burn patients. Numbers of T3, T4 and T11 cells significantly decreased during hydrocortisone infusion while numbers of T8, HLA-DR and Leu7 lymphocytes did not change. Burn patients showed decreased numbers of T3 and T4 cells, but this T3/T4 lymphopenia was not as great as during hydrocortisone infusion. These results support the hypothesis that elevation of hydrocortisone is responsible for the lymphocyte phenotypic changes that occur in the early postburn period.\r"

Whereas various methods with and without anastomosis of the pancreas are recommended to deal with the pancreatic stump, mortality rates of 20 to 75 per cent have been reported. These different results prompted us to start a prospective, nonrandomized study in which three methods of reconstructing the remnant of the pancreas involving anastomosis were compared with pancreaticocutaneous drainage without anastomosis. One hundred and thirty-one patients with partial pancreaticoduodenectomy entered this trial, 54 female and 77 male patients with an average age of 55.9 years. The indications included: 42 instances of chronic pancreatitis, 44 instances of carcinoma of the pancreas and 45, periampullary carcinoma. We performed 33 end to side pancreaticojejunostomy procedures (four fistulas of the pancreas, a mortality rate of 15.0 per cent), 31 end to end anastomoses (three fistulas of the pancreas, a mortality rate of 6.5 per cent) and 48 double loops with anastomoses of the pancreatic and hepatic duct to separate jejunal loops (nine fistulas of the pancreas, a mortality rate of 2 per cent). Nineteen patients were operated upon using external drainage of the pancreatic stump by means of Penrose drains (five fistulas of the pancreas, a mortality rate of zero per cent). To reduce the fatal risks caused by combined fistulas of the pancreas and biliary tract, the use of separate intestinal loops for anastomoses of the pancreas and biliary tract offers the best solution, since no fatal complications of the pancreaticojejunostomy were observed. In contrast, pancreaticocutaneous drainage was performed upon patients with endangered pancreatic anastomoses due to local morphologic conditions, such as tender pancreatic parenchyma or thin pancreatic ducts. The total loss of exocrine function and the high morbidity rate of 37 per cent is justified in spite of the mortality rate of zero per cent. Total pancreaticoduodenectomy, for technical reasons, represents no acceptable alternative in view of higher mortality rates.\r"

  ".W": "Incidence of gallstones in morbidly obese patients and further development of symptomatic gallstones with weight loss after bariatric operations were studied. Of the 552 patients with mean preoperative weight 210.4 per cent of ideal, jejunoileal bypass has been performed upon 63, horizontal gastric partitioning in 184 and vertical banded gastroplasty in 305. Cholecystectomy had been done previously upon 146 patients (26.4 per cent). A further 67 patients (12.1 per cent) underwent cholecystectomy at the time of bariatric surgical treatment for diagnosed gallstones. The remaining 339 patients at risk of having cholelithiasis develop after a bariatric operation have been observed for more than one to 12 years; symptomatic gallstones requiring cholecystectomy developed in 39. Of these 339 patients, 17 had the symptomatic gallstones in the first year, 17 in the second year and only five from two to 12 years postoperatively. The pathologic type of stone was cholesterol in 87 per cent and mixed in 13 per cent (the latter were patients who underwent jejunoileal bypasses). In the 339 patients, 280 had lost greater than or equal to 50 per cent and 59 had lost less than 50 per cent of excess weight; symptomatic gallstones developed in 33 of the 280 in the former group and six of the 59 in the latter (p = 0.06). Although no complications resulted, concomitant cholecystectomy was often difficult in these massively obese patients, whereas cholecystectomy after weight loss has been relatively easy. Routine cholecystectomy at the time of these operations does not appear justified.\r"

  ".W": "A new procedure is presented for esophageal reconstruction using the skin flap combined with the overlying muscle flap in a situation in which preceding cervical esophagostomy and antesternal colostomy have been performed. A conventional musculocutaneous flap may be used for the second stage of the operation. However, our method has several advantages. The skin canal, which is the most important part of this reconstruction, is created using the skin of the anterior chest wall without transferring cutaneous tissue from other places. Therefore, the operative procedure becomes simpler and the blood supply to the skin canal is more assured. While blood of the wall of the canal is supposed to be supplied initially from internal mammary and intercostal arteries, the muscle flap over the canal may subsequently provide more blood to the skin canal. In addition to sufficient blood supply, the length of a suture line for creating the skin canal is minimal, and, thereby, the possibility of postoperative leakage can be diminished. Because both esophagostoma and colostoma are not damaged in the second stage of the operation, strictures at these sites are not likely to occur. Furthermore, the muscle flap serves as a physical protector for the canal, and presents a suitable bed for the split thickness graft. Our two stage operation using combined skin and muscle flaps after antesternal colostomy is a safe, simple and assured technique for the compromised colonic segment at primary esophageal reconstruction. This procedure is also applicable to the patient in whom use of a stomach tube for esophageal replacement is attempted but primary cervical esophagogastrotomy is not possible.\r"

These included acute arterial thromboses, graft thromboses, arterial emboli and pulmonary emboli. Twenty-seven of 34 patients treated had evidence of lysis, 14 had complete lysis, 13 had partial lysis and seven had no lysis. Both patients with occlusions for longer than three weeks failed to respond to treatment. Thirty-two patients presented with ischemia of the extremity. Twenty-four of 32 patients had limb salvage with eight subsequently undergoing amputation. No patient who was treated for claudication or who had a patent popliteal artery distal to the acute thrombosis failed to respond. Extensive tibioperoneal occlusion generally responded poorly compared with femoropopliteal or more proximal thrombi. Complications are divided into direct (drug related) and indirect (technique related). Four of 34 patients had an extensive hemorrhagic event with two suffering intracranial bleeding who ultimately died. All of the patients with extensive hemorrhagic episodes had serum fibrinogen levels of less than 50 milligrams per cent. During infusion, extensive distal emboli occurred in three with two of these patients requiring thrombectomy; one instance resolved with infusion. Minor distal emboli occurred in three and all resolved with continued infusion. We believe that intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy is a valuable adjunct in the treatment of acute arterial occlusion. The local infusion of lytic agents appears to be more efficient than systemic therapy. The tip of the infusion catheter should be placed into the thrombus for optimal lysis, but not advanced too far. The fibrinogen level is a sensitive indicator of systemic lysis and should be maintained above 50 milligrams per cent. Systemic lysis is obtained even with low dose infusion when therapy exceeds six hours. Intra-arterial infusion of thrombolytic agents can be performed safely in the immediate postoperative period as well as intraoperatively if specific guidelines are followed. Patients with massive unilateral pulmonary embolism can be efficiently treated with intra-arterial lytic therapy.\r"

In 11 of these patients, the choledochoscope had been used to visualize the ductal anatomy and in each instance the ampulla of Vater was visualized from within and judged to be patent. Calibration, not dilation of the ampulla was performed upon ten of the patients. Transient edema or spasm of the ampulla secondary to operative trauma, stone removal or underlying disease was diagnosed and in each patient the operation was terminated after the cholangiogram. Follow-up cholangiography in each instance demonstrated a patent ampulla, free flow into the duodenum and no strictures or stones. It is concluded from these data that with operative choledochoscopy the anatomy and pathologic characteristics of the biliary tract can be visualized and the patency of the ampulla of Vater can be assessed.\r"

General surgeons were those more likely to choose a rural area, a community hospital and no teaching responsibilities. Subspecialists were those more likely to choose an urban area, a university hospital and a complete teaching environment. Two-thirds of residents thought there was an oversupply of general surgeons. They were more likely to take fellowships, especially those in transplantation, vascular, trauma, oncologic and colorectal surgery. Women represented less than 10 per cent of chief residents.

During the two year period ending April 1985, 150 consecutive patients undergoing celiotomy for penetrating abdominal trauma were prospectively randomized to receive either mezlocillin (4 grams every six hours) or clindamycin (600 milligrams every six hours) and gentamicin (loading dose of 2.0 milligrams per kilogram, then 1.5 milligrams per kilogram every eight hours). Antibiotics were begun in the emergency department with duration of coverage based upon the injury pattern--colon, five days; other hollow visceral injury, two days, and all others, one day. Ten patients were excluded due to breach in protocol and other patients died within 48 hours of presentation. The two study groups, comprised of the remaining 130 patients, were comparable with respect to age, sex, injury mechanism, incidence of colonic injuries, intraoperative blood replacement and abdominal trauma index. Overall incidence of septic morbidity was similar among the groups; ten of the 61 patients receiving mezlocillin and nine of those receiving clindamycin and gentamicin had infection develop. There was no significant difference with respect to extensive abdominal infection (10 versus 3 per cent). The pattern of postoperative infection and offending pathogens were similar in the study groups. Enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus and Bacteroides species were most frequently isolated. Infection was due to an organism resistant to the initial study regimen in one of the ten failures with mezlocillin and in two of the nine failures with clindamycin and gentamicin. Mezlocillin, a single agent broad spectrum penicillin, achieved comparable results with more expensive potentially toxic combination therapy for penetrating wounds.\r"

The results of this series demonstrate that Marlex mesh is well tolerated in the inguinal canal and that the recurrence rates are low for both direct and indirect inguinal hernias. In particular, there were no recurrences in patients less than 60 years of age and no recurrence in patients weighing less than 185 kilograms. The average weight of patients with a recurrence was 92 kilograms and the average age was 72 years old. Several possible ways to improve the technique are discussed.\r"

This study was done to describe the use of local anesthesia and modified radical mastectomy (with sparing of the pectoralis minor muscle) in 17 patients who were considered a poor risk for general anesthesia and had Stages IIIa and IIIb carcinomas of the breast. Patient acceptance was excellent in 14, moderate in two and poor in one patient. Blood loss never exceeded 75 milliliters and a mean of 120 milligrams of Xylocaine (lidocaine) was used. No apparent central nervous system toxicity was observed. Mean time on the surgical service was 2.7 days. Modified radical mastectomy can be successfully accomplished in patients considered a \"poor risk\" for general anesthesia and with locally advanced carcinoma of the breast using local anesthesia with minimal blood loss and excellent patient acceptance.\r"

Three tests were used. The first contained 150 milliliters of 50 per cent glucose alone, the second had 150 milliliters of 50 per cent glucose with 5 grams of guar gum (viscose dietary fiber) and the third was a vegetable meal containing 75 grams of glucose. All of the patients with total gastrectomy had eating related symptoms, such as dumping and difficulties with the large volume of a meal. They had to eat small meals and the most usually experienced postprandial symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea and faintness. The postprandial serum glucose level was highest after drinking glucose alone and the lowest after eating the vegetable meal (as the highest 9.4 +/- 2.0 and 6.2 +/- 1.6 millimole per liter, respectively, 50 minutes postprandially, p less than 0.01). Hyperglycemia was associated with nausea, sweating, faintness, reduction of blood pressure and increase of pulse rate. The large volume of the vegetable meal produced difficulties (dysphagia and abdominal distension) in eating for everyone except one patient. Guar gum eaten with glucose reduced the postprandial hyperglycemia near to the level found after the vegetable meal. Also, the symptoms experienced after glucose with guar gum reduced from that after glucose alone, five patients became symptomless. Four of these five patients have supplemented guar gum regularly for several months into their daily meals with the result of reduction of the postprandial subjective symptoms. The dose has been adjusted individually from 2 to 7 grams of guar gum three times daily. Loose stools and diarrhea may occur at the beginning. These are avoided by a gradual increase of the dose during an adaptation period of two weeks. Sometimes glucose with guar gum may result in hypoglycemia with prolonged symptoms after immediate hyperglycemia. It is concluded that guar gum gives a possibility to avoid the symptoms related to a large volume of a meal and to reduce those produced by a high glucose content of a meal in patients after total gastrectomy. Guar gum also works in practical prolonged use when the dose is estimated from postprandial symptoms.\r"

This procedure was used upon 86 patients. Anatomic and symptomatic relief was obtained in 96.4 per cent of the patients.

Three hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent aortobifemoral bypass (209) or femoropopliteal bypass (117) between 1969 and 1978 were observed to determine whether or not the discontinuation of cigarette smoking affected the long term results of these grafts. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 smoked preoperatively and postoperatively; group 2 smoked preoperatively but not postoperatively, and group 3 did not smoke at all. The five year cumulative success rates for aortobifemoral bypass in the groups were: 42 per cent for group 1 (130 patients); 77 per cent for group 2 (67 patients), and 71 per cent for group 3 (12 patients) (p less than 0.001). In the femoropopliteal group, the variation with regard to the known patency rates of autogenous and prosthetic grafts made the results more difficult to assess. For all grafts the five year cumulative success rates were: 38 per cent of group 1 (57 patients); 33 per cent for group 2 (40 patients), and 70 per cent for group 3 (20 patients) (p less than 0.001). Subdivision of groups 1 and 2 into autogenous and synthetic grafts gave identical success rates of 54 per cent for long saphenous vein grafts (66). Prosthetic grafts were successful at five years in 19 per cent of the patients in group 1 (16 patients) and 43 per cent in group 2 (15 patients). These results were not significant. These results clearly favor the postoperative nonsmoker over the smoker in the aortofemoral group but the distinction in the femoropopliteal group is less clear, although there is a similar trend.\r"

This observation prompted the recommendation that patients with hernias be thoroughly screened for disease of the colon and rectum. That recommendation remains controversial in part because it has not previously been prospectively evaluated. In a one year period, 202 consecutive patients with inguinal hernias completed a preoperative protocol which included: 1, gastrointestinal history; 2, rectal examination; 3, testing of at least two stool specimens with the Hemoccult (Smith Kline Diagnostics) device; 4, sigmoidoscopy, and 5, barium enema. Malignant and premalignant diseases were discovered in five patients, only one of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. Each malignant lesion was localized (Dukes' A or B) and, therefore, highly curable. Benign disease was found in 49 patients, including polyps in eight and one instance of tight sigmoid stricture. All of the malignant and 91 per cent of the benign lesions were in patients 50 years of age and older. The association between inguinal herniation and colorectal disease was previously attributed to luminal obstruction. In the present series, however, the sole obstructing lesion was a benign stricture. Another explanation for this association must, therefore, be sought. We conclude, on the basis of the results of this experience, however, that screening for pathologic factors of the colon and rectum is warranted in otherwise asymptomatic patients who are more than 50 years old and who present with inguinal hernias.\r"

The technique presented herein differs from the traditional method by: 1, primary trocar entry at a 90 degree angle to the horizontal plane, and 2, confirmation for intraperitoneal position of the instruments before creating the pneumoperitoneum. A retrospective study was done to compare demographic, medical and surgical data of obese and non-obese patients. No important differences were found and it was also found that obesity was not a relative contraindication to laparoscopy. Obesity was defined by a ponderal index of less than 11.7. No operative complications were found for the 344 obese patients studied and all laparoscopy procedures were completed as intended. These differences in technique can avoid the pitfalls commonly reported concerning laparoscopy of the obese patient.\r"

The ages of the patients ranged from 12 to 22 years. The most common lesion was fibroadenoma (19) followed by gigantomastia and cystosarcoma phyllodes. A malignant lesion is rare in this age group and both instances in this series had predisposing factors (for example, prior regional radiation in childhood). The findings of this study, plus that of the literature reviewed, emphasize conservative treatment with observation followed by simple excision when the patient nears completion of the development of the breast in most instances.\r"

Occlusive cerebrovascular disease was the most frequent pathology seen, representing 40% of the population studied. Spinal degenerative myeloradiculopathy represented 14%, tumors 7%, trauma 5.4%, and intracranial hematomas represented 4% of the population. Vascular anomalies represented 3.3% of the patient group, with almost the same number of patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage. The percentage of patients who were surgically treated was 58%. Mortality was 6.5%, with only 2.5% of the patients requiring special-care-facility placement following release from the hospital. An older group, aged 85 and over, represented 4% of our geriatric population. In the age 85+ group, occlusive cerebrovascular disease was the leading pathology (18% of the population), followed by subdural hematomas (15%), spinal degenerative myeloradiculopathy (11.6%), trigeminal neuralgias (7%), hydrocephalus (4%), vascular anomalies (4%), and tumors (4%). Patients in the age 85+ group were surgically treated in 41% of the cases, with a mortality of less than 10%. In the past, older age (greater than 65 years) was believed to be a contraindication to surgery, however, the increased life expectancy, number, and health of this population made reconsideration of this arbitrary age limit essential. We feel that age alone is not a barrier to proper neurosurgical treatment when other risk factors are adequately managed.\r"

MPA acted as a competitive binder to meningioma-PR: The mean PR values were 15.6 fmol/mg protein (range 0-69) and 338.3 fmol/g tumor (range 0-1190), respectively. In comparison, mean PR values of our untreated meningioma series (n = 58) were 54.9 fmol/mg protein (range 0-586) and 2813 fmol/g tumor (range 0-17,168), respectively. In cases of two-stage resection of meningiomas MPA significantly decreased PR activity in the cytoplasm of meningioma cells. We conclude that MPA binds to meningioma PRs, however, its effect on the growth rate of meningiomas has still to be elucidated.\r"

Clinical manifestations included visual disturbances (2 cases), headache (1 case), and hypogonadism (3 cases). Laboratory tests demonstrated high basal serum prolactin (PRL) levels and evidence of involvement of other anterior pituitary hormones in all cases. Treatment was followed by marked improvement of symptoms paralleled by a sharp decrease of serum PRL levels, which normalized in 1 case. Some other anterior pituitary functions also improved. Computed tomography scan revealed shrinkage of the tumor in all cases. There were no local or serious systemic side effects. These initial findings suggest that long-acting injectable bromocriptine has a place in the initial treatment of macroprolactinomas, especially for those with neurological and/or visual manifestations. It can also be used to select patients for surgery, in the cases where clinical and radiological improvement could not be obtained. The effects of long-term use remain to be established by further studies.\r"

Two groups of patients with parathyroid adenomas were used for comparison. Group A consisted of eight patients with \"atypical\" benign adenomas (mean preoperative level of serum calcium: 13.4 mg/dl); group B consisted of 13 patients with benign typical adenomas--all with preoperative serum calcium levels greater than or equal to 13.0 mg/dl (mean: 14.2 mg/dl). The patients with carcinoma (mean preoperative level of serum calcium: 15.3 mg/dl) had a frequency of osteoporosis and osteitis fibrosa cystica (50%) comparable with that of group A (33%) and group B (62%). Seventy percent of the patients with carcinoma had renal disease (nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, or impaired renal function), whereas only 38% of group A and 15% of group B had similar disorders. The patients with carcinomas had the highest frequency of combined bone and renal disease (50% versus 14% in group A and 15% in group B). Anemia, peptic ulcer disease, and hypertension occurred with similar frequencies in the three groups. Three patients with recurrent parathyroid carcinoma died of profound hypercalcemia, renal failure, or cardiac arrhythmia. In general, although patients with parathyroid carcinomas have more profound metabolic abnormalities than do patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the metabolic manifestations in patients with parathyroid carcinoma are comparable with those in patients with parathyroid adenomas and profound hypercalcemia. Furthermore atypical adenomas share many anatomic and histopathologic features with parathyroid carcinomas, and distinguishing between the two is sometimes possible only in cases of tumor recurrence.\r"

The former operation was performed on 35 patients between June 1969 and November 1983 and the latter on 29 patients between October 1983 and January 1986. There were no significant differences in the patients' backgrounds between the two study groups. Blood loss during surgery was significantly greater and operation time was longer in the original shunt group than in the modified shunt group. The incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality was also significantly higher in the former group than in the latter (major complication rate: 20.0% versus 3.4%; operative death within 1 month: 5.7% versus 0%; in-hospital death: 11.4% versus 3.4%). The modified shunts had a 100% patency rate, and no variceal bleeding was evident, whereas shunt occlusion was observed in two patients and portal thrombosis in one patient of the original shunt group. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was 14.3% in the original shunt group and 6.9% in the modified shunt group, and the follow-up time was shorter in the latter group. A significantly greater rate of survival was achieved with the modified Warren shunts. Thus the current study seems to indicate that our modifications could be alternatives to the original distal splenorenal shunt in terms of postoperative morbidity, mortality, and survival.\r"

One of these patients had metastatic, unresectable disease and was operated on for palliation while three had resectable metastases and were included in the \"curative\" resection group. The resection involved the iliac vessels in three patients, the femoral vessels in six patients and the posterior tibial vessels in one patient. Ten arterial grafts were used--nine of them synthetic and one a reversed saphenous graft. Of six venous synthetic grafts, two remained patent for 3 and 4 months, while four clotted in the immediate postoperative period. Two of the patients have moderate swelling if they stand for a prolonged time, which is well controlled with elastic support. Of two infections, one involved the arterial graft and necessitated amputation. Adjuvant radiation was used in three patients and adjuvant chemotherapy in five patients. Three patients underwent chemotherapy for measurable metastatic disease. Of eight patients who underwent curative resection and successful arterial reconstruction, none has relapsed locally in a follow-up period ranging from 12 to 61 months (mean: 24.8 months). Six of the nine patients who underwent curative resection remain alive and well at 12 to 61 months (mean: 27 months). Limb salvage for sarcomas of the extremities, which involves major vessel resection and reconstruction, is an effective method of treatment and is preferable to amputation.\r"

Few studies exist that compare the tissue effects of electrocautery with newer laser modalities. In this study, the tissue effects of electrocautery, noncontact Nd:YAG, contact Nd:YAG, and CO2 lasers were studied in the stomach, small bowel, colon, liver, and pancreas in 24 rats. At light microscopic examination, all tissue damage was thermal in nature, irrespective of the modality used. Furthermore, an independent observer was unable to distinguish which method has been used in most tissues. Tissue effects were similar in the stomach, small intestine, and colon after use of all the modalities. The CO2 laser caused slightly less damage than the other methods (p less than 0.05), but with use of this modality, hemostasis could not be achieved in the liver and pancreas. The contact Nd:YAG laser caused moderate damage with excellent hemostasis in all tissue. The noncontact Nd:YAG caused significantly more tissue damage than all other methods (p less than 0.01), especially in the liver and pancreas. The results suggest that the new contact laser system provides an effective method of performing gastrointestinal surgery with especially good hemostatic effects on liver and pancreatic resections.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluates the long-term efficacy of reconstructive surgery for renovascular hypertension caused by arteriosclerosis, which was performed on 112 patients from 1959 to 1983. Despite medical therapy, all patients had persistent hypertension, with a mean preoperative blood pressure of 188/113 mm Hg. Their median age was 49 years, and the median duration of objectively documented hypertension was 21 months at the time of surgery. Manifestations of extrarenal arteriosclerosis (ERA) were present in 57 patients (51%). Results were evaluated both at a short-term (ST) interval (mean: 8.4 months) and at a long-term (LT) interval (mean: 8.9 years) postoperatively. Patients were classified by means of strict criteria as cured, improved, or unsuccessfully treated. If a patient was cured or if his condition improved, this was considered a beneficial blood pressure response. Beneficial responses were maintained during LT follow-up, since the respective percentages for cure and improvement were 24% and 50% at the ST interval and 18% and 61% at the LT interval. These results had not been influenced by either older age or the presence of ERA, since results were similar in patients older and younger than the median age and in those with and without ERA. The preoperative duration of hypertension was the only pertinent clinical feature that influenced the LT interval results, LT beneficial responses were observed in 95% of the patients with a shorter duration and in 78% of those with a longer duration of preoperative hypertension than the median (p = 0.01). We conclude that surgical therapy for renovascular hypertension caused by arteriosclerosis can effectively reduce blood pressure and that this result is maintained during LT follow-up. In terms of anticipated blood pressure response, older age, longer duration of hypertension, and the presence of ERA do not exclude surgical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous epidural anesthesia (CEPA) has been recommended on the basis of limited reported experience as being safe to use during elective peripheral revascularization. This study surveyed peer acceptance and safety by means of a questionnaire that was mailed to the 190 members of the Southern Association for Vascular Surgery (52% rate of response). Of the respondents, 42% used CEPA and 54% considered it safe; 895 cases were compiled without complication. Twenty-five consecutive patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstruction were then studied under a prospective protocol, which measured left ventricular function perioperatively. Preanesthetic, nitroglycerin-induced volume loading averaged 3570 ml in 15 general anesthesia (GA) cases and 3463 ml in 10 CEPA cases. Intraoperative volumes averaged 4341 ml GA and 6350 ml CEPA; after correction for blood loss per administration, patients in whom CEPA was used received an average 3080 ml excess volume. Eighteen-hour postoperative volumes averaged 1750 ml GA and 3156 ml CEPA. In the GA cohort, cardiac index fell from 3.57 to 2.80 L/min-m2 and rebounded to 3.07 L/min-m2 after unclamping. Left ventricular stroke work index fell from 56 to 46 gm-m/m2 (p less than 0.05), remained greater than 45 throughout clamping, and rebounded to 51 after unclamping. In the CEPA cohort, cardiac index fell from 3.50 to 2.85 L/min-m2 after supplemental GA administration, fell to a low of 2.30 L/min-m2 and remained at that range throughout the study; left ventricular stroke work index fell from 50 to 35 gm-m/m2 and remained depressed throughout. All intraoperative values were significantly (p less than 0.001 to p less than 0.05) depressed from baseline values, and from before unclamping and onward they were significantly (p less than 0.01) depressed as compared with those of the GA cohort. The use of CEPA has moderate peer group acceptance and apparently few major technique-related complications in elective revascularization cases. In aortic surgical procedures, and when combined with GA, the use of CEPA results in greater total perioperative fluid volume administration and has the potential for subtle left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

In contrast, PYY concentrations were low in 16 patients who had undergone colonic resection and ileostomy (fasting 7.1 +/- 0.7 pmol/L, p less than 0.01). In eight patients who had undergone pancreatectomies, basal and postprandial PYY levels were moderately increased (23.4 +/- 3.5 pmol/L; fasting p less than 0.001). PYY does not appear to have a role in the adaptive trophic response after small intestinal resection, but it may contribute to reduction of gastric secretion and gastrointestinal transit in these patients.\r"

The 5-year survival rate of the patients with tumor exposed to the serosa (n = 17) was significantly lower than that of the patients with tumor limited to the mucosa (n = 7), muscularis (n = 7), or subserosa (n = 5). Macroscopically, all tumors limited to the mucosa and 6 of 7 limited to the muscularis were of the papillary form, which was associated with a better patient survival (p less than 0.05) than the nodular or infiltrative form present in 11 of 17 tumors that penetrated to the serosa. The papillary or well-differentiated carcinoma--present in all patients with tumors superficial to the gallbladder subserosa--had a higher survival (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01) than the moderately or poorly differentiated carcinoma present in 7 of 17 tumors with spread to the serosa. Incidences of venous, lymphatic, or perineural invasion were higher in tumors that spread beyond the serosa than those limited to the mucosa (p less than 0.05), and survival differed between patients with and without these characteristics (p less than 0.001). Analysis for nuclear DNA pattern of those tumors limited to the mucosa revealed its lower cellular malignancy. Patients with tumors superficial to the subserosa survived longer after undergoing extended cholecystectomy than those who underwent simple cholecystectomy (p less than 0.05). The prognosis of gallbladder carcinoma was highly influenced not only by the biologic nature of tumor but by the surgical procedures used.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with generalized primary parathyroid hyperplasia were treated with attempted total parathyroidectomy and placement of an autogenous parathyroid graft in the forearm musculature; these patients have been followed for up to 79 months. We assessed completeness of parathyroidectomy on the basis of the background immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) value 3 to 7 days after surgery, which predicted the chance of a graft-independent recurrence or persistence of hyperparathyroidism (0/8 if undetectable versus 4/5 if normal or high). Total parathyroidectomy was sometimes difficult to achieve because of the presence of supernumerary or ectopic parathyroid glands; to enhance the success rate of total parathyroidectomy, we suggest both the use of preoperative ultrasonography to locate intrathyroidal parathyroids and a routine search for supernumerary parathyroids that includes transcervical thymectomy. Graft function was monitored by measuring the secretory gradient for iPTH (the difference between the two antecubital fossae). Gradients on postoperative days 3 to 7 were barely detectable, but by 3 weeks, larger iPTH gradients were noted in every case. By 4 months, the graft could maintain normal serum calcium levels in all but one case. Autonomous graft function has evolved in four of six evaluable patients with type I multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN I), but in none of the nine patients with sporadic hyperplasia (p = 0.043). A prospective study is needed to determine whether the use of a smaller number of parathyroid fragments for the autogenous graft in known MEN I patients might delay recurrence.\r"

Simultaneous intramuscular administration of (10 mg/kg) coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) increased the survival rates of LPS-administered mice to 69.7%. When LPS administration was increased to 30 mg/kg, no survivors were observed in the placebo group. Simultaneous intravenous injection of CoQ10 (10 mg/kg) or alpha-tocopherol (20 mg/kg) restored the survival rate to 52.9% or 42.9%, respectively. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the liver, which is the best index of the energy state, decreased gradually to 70% of the control ATP level 24 hours after LPS (15 mg/kg) administration. The lipid peroxide level in the liver increased fivefold 16 hours after LPS administration and then decreased to the control level in 8 hours. Simultaneous treatment of mice with antioxidants, such as CoQ10 or alpha-tocopherol, completely suppressed the lipid peroxide level in the liver and preserved the hepatic ATP level in the normal range. These results indicate that LPS induced hepatic damage in mice because of lipid peroxidation and that antioxidants suppressed lipid peroxidation, preserved energy metabolism in the liver, and enhanced survival of endotoxin-administered mice.\r"

  ".W": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation invariably accompanies placement of peritoneovenous (LeVeen) shunts, which suggests that ascitic fluid contains procoagulant material capable of activating blood coagulation. In this study, we identified thrombogenic activity in human ascites and the hemostatic pathway by which it acts. Peritoneal fluid was removed percutaneously from patients with ascites due to various causes. Four fractions were prepared by centrifugation: cells, a low-speed, cell-free fluid, a high-speed supernatant, and the precipitate from the high-speed centrifugation. Cellular fractions from all ascitic fluids shortened a one-stage clotting time of normal pooled plasma by 68% in comparison with saline solution and endotoxin controls. Similarly, the cell-free fluids also shortened the clotting time of normal pooled plasma by 41%. The cellular and cell-free fractions shortened the clotting time of factor VIII-deficient plasma but failed to demonstrate procoagulant activity in factor VII-deficient plasma. These fractions had no effect on platelet aggregation or the platelet release reaction. The high-speed precipitate was dissociated by ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (EDTA) into fluid phase and precipitate, both of which demonstrated procoagulant activity. Furthermore, high-speed precipitate contained protein, phospholipid, and sterol in proportions similar to those of plasma membranes and contained membrane-bound vesicles as identified by means of electron microscopy. This material could be rendered inactive by heating to 100 degrees C for 2 minutes or by incubation with phospholipase C for 15 minutes. Finally, the ability of the high-speed precipitate to shorten the clotting time was prevented by preincubation with a monoclonal antibody, which is known to inhibit the procoagulant activity of human tissue factor. We suggest that several entities contribute to the procoagulant properties of human ascites, with procoagulant material deriving at least in part from peritoneal cells. The sedimentable procoagulant factor appears to be associated with cellular membranes or membrane fragments and is thromboplastin-like in its chemical composition, immunoreactivity, and substrate specificity.\r"

The relative ease with which a primary tumor in the psoas major muscle can be excised makes the retroperitoneal approach desirable from the surgeon's point of view.\r"

This was predominantly due to a higher than expected incidence of diseases of the circulatory organs. The greater risk of death--compared with the expected mortality in the general patient population--appeared to decrease after the initial 5 to 8 postoperative years. However, for the entire follow-up period, the cumulative survival ratio (i.e., the ratio between the expected and the observed rates) was less than 1 for both sexes. The preoperative concentration of serum calcium did not influence the survival rates. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that untreated hyperparathyroidism carries an increased risk of death, particularly from cardiovascular diseases but that this risk is gradually reduced after surgery.\r"

Recurrent symptoms following sympathectomy have been attributed to incorrect diagnosis, delayed treatment, or secondary gains. This report concerns a case of lower-extremity reflex sympathetic dystrophy that recurred following an initially curative sympathectomy and that responded to treatment with contralateral sympathectomy. We suggest that these recurrent symptoms may be due to reinnervation from the contralateral lumbar sympathetic chain.\r"

  ".W": "The reports on surgical techniques that specifically focus on the management and outcome of patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHD) who undergo major intra-abdominal procedures--particularly of an emergency nature--are few. It is hoped that by analysis of our experience the nature of the problem can be further clarified and guidelines for clinical care can be formulated. Thirty-two cases which encompass a 7-year period (1978 to 1985), were reviewed. Seventeen patients underwent elective surgery and fifteen underwent emergency intervention. There was a wide range of cases that were similar to those most generally seen in an acute-care teaching hospital. The morbidity and mortality rates in elective surgery patients were 12% and 6%, respectively, while in the emergency cases, these rates were 62% and 47%. Patients with diabetes had the highest morbidity and mortality. These results were analyzed, and we conclude that CHD patients at risk with a surgically correctable condition should be considered for elective intervention, even if they are currently free of symptoms. This may be particularly true for CHD patients with diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "87234902\r", 
  ".W": "Partial ileal bypass (PIB) and ingestion of alfalfa are both known to lower plasma cholesterol (C) levels. During an 18-week period, the combined effects of both were studied in four randomized groups of rabbits receiving C-free, hypercholesterolemia-inducing, semisynthetic diets 3 weeks after sham or PIB surgery. The diets, with or without alfalfa, had similar overall compositions of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and fiber. We measured blood C, triglycerides (T), and lipoprotein fractions of both C and T at biweekly intervals. In vivo liver and small-bowel synthesis of C, fatty acids (FA), and nonsaponifiable lipids (NSL) were determined with radioactive 14C-acetate at the end of the study. The results were evaluated by means of analysis of variance using unweighted cell means. The combined PIB and alfalfa modalities significantly lower C levels in serum, plasma, low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins by 66%, 71%, 85%, and 35%, respectively. However, due to alfalfa, a significant increase of 49% was observed in plasma T when both treatments were combined. Liver FA synthesis was significantly decreased (65%) with PIB and increased (161%) with alfalfa; when the two treatments are combined, a nonsignificant response was observed. Similarly, this inverse relationship for PIB and alfalfa was seen for C and NSL synthesis. Small-bowel FA synthesis was significantly decreased (72%) by the combination of PIB and alfalfa. We conclude that alfalfa suppresses, in part, the physiologic rebound effect of PIB surgery by increasing hepatic C and NSL synthesis; inversely, PIB surgery inhibits the additive effect in the liver synthesis of FA produced by alfalfa. Alfalfa and PIB alone, and synergistically, decrease total small-bowel lipid synthesis, specifically that of FA. Alfalfa is an effective adjuvant to PIB for reducing total and lipoprotein C fractions.\r"

The treatment consisted of an injection of phenol 80% into the sinus tract after the patients had undergone depilation and excavation while under local anesthesia. The number of phenol injections in each patient varied from one to nine (mean: two injections). Patients were considered cured if no signs of recurrent pilonidal sinus disease occurred within 1 year after treatment. The mean follow-up period after cure was 3 years (range: 1 to 6 years). The recurrence rate was 6.3% (a 95% confidence interval of 1.3% to 17.2%), which was one of the lowest reported for different methods of treatment for pilonidal sinus disease. The good results in this study justify continuation of conservative treatment of pilonidal sinus disease, especially in view of the low costs and the high degree of patient comfort. Sclerosing therapy with phenol is thus recommended as a successful treatment for complicated pilonidal sinus disease.\r"

The diagnosis of disseminated atheroembolism from extensive degeneration of the thoracic and abdominal aorta was based on clinical evidence of cutaneous atheroembolism, angiographic demonstration of irregular aortic plaques, and findings of cholesterol emboli in tissue specimens. All patients had severe cardiopulmonary disease. In four cases treatment consisted of palliative axillobifemoral bypass with ligation of the external iliac arteries to exclude the proximal aortic source of emboli to the feet. Three patients underwent intestinal resection for visceral atheroembolism. Permanent access for hemodialysis was required in four patients. All patients died within 6 months of the diagnosis of disseminated atheroembolism. Surgical therapy has three roles in disseminated atheroembolism: prevention of further atheroembolism with its attendant peripheral or visceral organ damage; amputation or resection of irretrievably damaged tissue; and provision of chronic hemodialysis access. The optimal treatment is thoracoabdominal reconstruction of the aorta. In the high-risk patient, axillobifemoral bypass with iliac ligation may be used to treat recurrent painful atheroembolism to the feet. Continuing atheroembolism to the visceral and pelvic circulation, renal failure, and progressive asthenia are associated with the poor prognosis of patients with this disease.\r"

To determine which laboratory and radiologic tests were useful, a prospective comparison of all currently available modalities was begun in 1978. Sixty-six patients at high risk for recurrent large-bowel cancer were studied. At present, mean follow-up is at 4 1/2 years. Protocol studies included monthly carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays for 3 years and then at 3-month intervals for 2 more years. A review of symptoms and a physical examination were performed every 4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for 2 more years. Computerized tomograms of the abdomen, full lung tomograms, and liver/spleen scintigrams were obtained every 4 months for 3 years and then annually for 2 more years. Intravenous pyelography, barium enema, and bone scintigraphy were performed yearly for 5 years. Thirty-three recurrences were observed in 31 patients. A progressive rise in serial CEA values was the first indication of recurrence in 22 of 33 patients (67%), review of symptoms and physical examination in seven of 33 (21%), CT scan in two of 33, and bone scintigraphy and full lung tomography each in one of 33 patients. Serial CEA assays and routine visits to a physician's office were the most useful tests in this study population. Use of a simplified follow-up plan will result in the earliest detection of recurrent colon cancer.\r"

Antibiotic therapy was instituted at 3 months postimplantation. Three groups were studied: (I) untreated controls (n = 3); (II) therapy with intravenous cefazolin 15 mg/kg/8 hr for 28 days (n = 7); and (III) combined therapy with intravenous rifampin 13 mg/kg/24 hr and intravenous clindamycin 13 mg/kg/8 hr for 28 days (n = 7).

The third control graft was thrombosed. Two group II animals demonstrated 1.6 X 10(7) and 2.3 X 10(5) CFU S. aureus organisms/gram of graft, respectively; the remaining five group II grafts were free of organisms. All group III grafts were sterile--a significant difference (p less than 0.05) from group I grafts.

  ".W": "Thirty two patients with persisting pulmonary sarcoidosis fulfilling defined criteria for treatment were managed according to a standard clinical protocol. In this an attempt was made to achieve and maintain maximal radiographic and physiological improvement with individually titrated doses of corticosteroids. Lavage cell counts, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE) determinations, and gallium-67 scans were planned at standard intervals but were not used in management decisions. The study analysed serial measurements in relation to changes in the clinical measurements. Twelve patients' radiographs showed complete clearing, seven cleared partially, and 13 had partial clearing with evidence of fibrosis. There was no predictive value in the initial lavage lymphocyte counts or the SACE or gallium measurements. Notably, in seven patients, substantial radiographic improvement was observed when the initial lavage lymphocyte counts were normal. Higher initial lavage neutrophil counts (p less than 0.02), higher initial radiographic profusion scores (p less than 0.02), and lower vital capacity (p less than 0.01) and carbon monoxide transfer factor (p less than 0.05) were related to incomplete clearing. A repeat study of the patients when their radiograph had cleared maximally showed that the levels of lavage lymphocytes, SACE, and gallium tended to fall, but frequently remained raised even in the presence of a normal radiograph or vital capacity or both. On the other hand, however, most of the patients with a normal lavage lymphocyte count showed persisting abnormality of the radiograph, lung function measurements, SACE, and gallium scan (or of at least one of these indices). The interrelationships between changes in clinical indices (radiograph, vital capacity, and transfer factor) and in lavage lymphocyte counts, SACE, and gallium scans showed that concordance was fairly poor in each comparison; lavage lymphocytes showed a greater major discordance than did the other pairs of measurements. Symptom free patients with normal or stable radiographic appearances have been followed for many months and have shown no clinical deterioration despite abnormal lavage lymphocyte counts, SACE, and gallium scans. Radiographic relapse, within the criteria defined, was seen in only four patients during the study; this was reflected in the gallium counts in three and in SACE and lavage lymphocyte counts measurements in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This report describes 29 cases of organic dust toxic syndrome (also known as pulmonary mycotoxicosis) occurring in 24 men and one woman with a mean age of 29 years. In 16 instances more than one worker was exposed to the dust, and in 12 of these shared exposures more than one worker became ill. Patients presented 5.3 (SD 3.3) hours after inhalation of organic dust and mould with fever (79%), myalgia (76%), chest tightness (72%), cough (66%), and headache (59%). The mean temperature was 38.7 degrees C and the mean white blood cell count 13.2 X 10(9)/l. In contrast to patients with allergic alveolitis, nearly all these patients had normal breath sounds, chest radiographs, and arterial oxygen saturation. Tests for precipitating antibodies to farmer's lung disease antigens gave negative results in all 26 episodes in which they were done; of these, 10 had no evidence of precipitating antibodies to an aqueous extract of the silage associated with their own illness. Organic dust toxic syndrome appears to be a common and substantial respiratory hazard to young farm workers. Despite being frequently mis-diagnosed as farmer's lung, organic dust toxic syndrome is clearly a distinctly different disease process.\r"

The calculated mean (SD) tissue volume of a single lung at total lung capacity was 467 (91) ml in the patients with alveolitis, which was 43% (14%) more than predicted for healthy people of the same age, sex, and height. The tissue volume of a single lung at total lung capacity was 436 (82) ml in the patients with chronic airflow limitation, which was 26% (21%) more than predicted. At residual volumes the tissue contents of the fibrotic and the obstructed lungs changed very little (to 407 (84) ml and 433 (84) ml respectively). This allowed tissue volume to be used as a marker of position within the lung, to match inspiratory and expiratory slices and to calculate regional ventilation. In both groups local ventilation was diminished and more variable than in healthy lungs--that is, in the mid 70% of lung volume the local residual volume to total gas volume ratios (RV/TGV) were 32% (10%) in the fibrotic group and 66% (14%) in the group with chronic airflow limitation, compared with 23% (5%) in healthy subjects. As expected, the fibrotic lungs were much denser (0.246 (0.036) g/ml) and the lungs with chronic airflow obstruction were less dense (0.114 (0.026) g/ml) than were healthy lungs (0.126 (0.017) g/ml).\r"

These were measured in patients with and without binders, in the supine position, raised up to 70 degrees on a tilt table, and seated upright. When patients were raised from the supine to the 70 degrees tilt and to the seated posture, sniff Pdi and VC decreased. Both binders improved VC in the seated position and at 70 degrees tilt, and sniff Pdi at 70 degrees tilt. The new binder was as effective as but no better than the conventional binder. PImax was too variable to be a valuable index of inspiratory power. These findings support the view that abdominal binders assist breathing in tetraplegic patients who are seated or raised to near vertical positions.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046, and a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA-861, on bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine was studied in 23 asthmatic subjects. The provocative concentration of acetylcholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PC20 FEV1) was measured before and after oral administration of OKY-046 (3000 mg over four days) and AA-861 (1100 mg over four days) and inhalation of OKY-046 (30 mg) in 10, 10, and nine asthmatic subjects respectively. Baseline values of FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were not altered by oral OKY-046, oral AA-861, or inhaled OKY-046. The geometric mean value of PC20 FEV1 increased significantly from 0.55 to 2.24 mg/ml after oral OKY-046, but was unchanged after inhalation of OKY-046 and after oral administration of AA-861. These results suggest that thromboxane A2 may play a part in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine.\r"

Proportional hazards analysis revealed that decreased survival was associated with increasing age, carotid artery distribution TIAs (compared with vertebrobasilar distribution TIAs), cigarette smoking, previous contralateral stroke, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus. We found great variation in the estimated survival of TIA patients, ranging from 5-year survivals of greater than 95% for 60-year-old patients with none of these risk factors to less than 25% for patients with all of these risk factors. Although the survival of the strata differed, the average mortality rates for this series of patients was about one-half of that observed for 225 patients accessed and followed by our center during 1961-1973.\r"

Patients were less than 70 years old and without clinical and/or ECG signs of previous heart disease; Holter monitoring was initiated within 48 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Arrhythmias were detected in 64 of the 70 patients (91%). Twenty-nine of the 70 patients (41%) showed serious cardiac arrhythmias; malignant ventricular arrhythmias, i.e., torsade de pointe and ventricular flutter or fibrillation, occurred in 3 cases. Serious ventricular arrhythmias were associated with QTc prolongation and hypokalemia. No correlation was found between the frequency and severity of cardiac arrhythmias and the neurologic condition, the site and extent of intracranial blood on computed tomography scan, or the location of ruptured malformation. The extremely high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, sometimes serious, in the acute period after subarachnoid hemorrhage and the absence of clinical and radiologic predictors make systematic continuous ECG monitoring compulsory to improve the overall results of subarachnoid hemorrhage, irrespective of early or delayed surgical treatment.\r"

The mean hematocrit was higher in patients with lacunes than with thrombotic or embolic strokes (p = 0.02). However, when blood pressure was also considered the increase in hematocrit in patients with lacunar stroke was significant only when systolic hypertension (greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg) was also present (p = 0.029); no significant difference in hematocrit was found between stroke subtypes in normotensive individuals. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that hypertension interacts with hematocrit in accounting for the observed association with lacunar infarcts. There was no trend for increased in-hospital mortality for stroke patients in either the low (less than or equal to 30, 30-36%) or high (greater than or equal to 47%) hematocrit groups.\r"

At all intervals up to and including 1 year poststroke, patients with left hemisphere strokes showed a strong relation between severity of depression and distance of the lesion on computed tomography scan from the frontal pole. At 2 years poststroke, this relation was no longer significant. The correlation between depression and impairment in activities of daily living peaked at 6 months and thereafter fell but remained significant at 1 and 2 years poststroke. The correlation between depression and cognitive impairment and between depression and social functioning fluctuated--with most correlations at 1 and 2 years follow-up nonsignificant. Although the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are limited by the fact that less than half of the original patients were followed up at each time, these declining correlations between depression and associated variables at 1 and 2 years follow-up may reflect the natural course of major depression which spontaneously remits between 1 and 2 years after stroke. The persisting significant association of impairment in activities of daily living with depression may reflect the effect of severe depression in sustaining and possibly retarding recovery from physical impairment.\r"

Improvement was not observed in 2 cases after extracranial-intracranial bypass alone or in 3 cases in which surgical intervention was not undertaken. Our results suggest that carotid endarterectomy is a more effective procedure than extracranial-intracranial bypass in improving retinal perfusion when compromised by ipsilateral carotid obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which organic calcium channel blockers inhibit cerebral vasoconstriction. Isolated bovine middle cerebral arteries were cut into rings to measure contractility or into strips to measure radioactive calcium (45Ca) influx and efflux. Calcium channel blockers (10(-5) M verapamil or 3.3 X 10(-7) M nifedipine) and calcium-deficient solutions all produced near-maximal inhibition of both potassium- and serotonin-induced constriction. In calcium-deficient solutions containing potassium or serotonin, verapamil and nifedipine each blocked subsequent calcium-induced constriction in a competitive manner. Potassium and serotonin significantly increased 45Ca uptake into cerebral artery strips during 5 minutes of 45Ca loading; for potassium 45Ca uptake increased from 62 to 188 nmol/g, and for serotonin from 65 to 102 nmol/g. Verapamil or nifedipine had no effect on basal 45Ca uptake but significantly blocked the increase in 45Ca uptake induced by potassium or serotonin. Potassium, and to a lesser extent serotonin, each induced a brief increase in the rate of 45Ca efflux into calcium-deficient solutions. Verapamil or nifedipine had no effect on basal or potassium-stimulated 45Ca efflux. The results demonstrate that verapamil and nifedipine block 45Ca uptake through both potential-operated (potassium) and receptor-operated (serotonin) channels in bovine middle cerebral arteries.\r"

This study evaluated the effects of the calcium antagonist nimodipine on CBF in a newborn beagle pup model of perinatal asphyxia lasting 5 minutes. Immediately after the asphyxial episode, nimodipine (2 micrograms/kg/min) or saline was infused for 10 minutes, following which [14C]iodoantipyrine determinations of CBF were performed. In noninsulted pups, nimodipine caused both significant decreases in CBF to cortical and deep gray structures as well as a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (p less than 0.05). In insulted pups, nimodipine similarly decreased MABP (p less than 0.001) and CBF to cortical and deep gray matter regions. Nimodipine appeared to have no effect on arterial blood gases and EEG tracings in either insulted or noninsulted pups. Although nimodipine may be shown to improve neurologic outcome in asphyxiated newborn infants, the limits of this study do not show the mechanism to be that of improving CBF.\r"

The thermal technique involves measurement of the rewarming curve generated after bolus infusion of 4-5 ml of ice-cold saline into the common carotid artery with a subdural thermistor placed on the parietal cortex. Evaluation of the biexponential decay curves obtained with this technique demonstrated a close correlation with total hemispheric, parietal, and parietal gray blood flow determined by simultaneous microsphere measurement. Despite significant correlations (p less than 0.001), scatter in the data produced a broad 95% confidence interval, thus making interpretation of blood flow with the thermal clearance technique impossible. Furthermore, instrumentation with the thermal probe, which required opening of the dura, blunted the cerebral blood flow response to hypercapnia. We conclude that the major limitations of the thermal clearance technique include: nonhomogeneous clearance function, significant variability, and depression of CO2 reactivity. These limitations must be addressed before this technique can be used reliably in the laboratory.\r"

  ".W": "Volume regulation of C6 glial cells was studied in anoxia in vitro to improve the understanding of ischemic cell swelling in the brain. Contrary to in vivo conditions, anoxia or anoxia plus iodoacetate for additional inhibition of anaerobic energy metabolism did not induce glial swelling. However, intracellular K+ was markedly decreased while intracellular Na+ increased. Induction of energy failure by anoxia plus iodoacetate was found to prevent the regulatory volume decrease on hyposmotic exposure of the cells, which is regularly observed in normoxic control conditions. Hyposmotic exposure in anoxia plus iodoacetate led only to an initial tendency of cell volume normalization followed by secondary cell swelling. This was associated with a net increase of intracellular Na+ that may explain the failure of volume regulation under these circumstances. Maintenance of a normal glial cell size during complete energy deprivation by anoxia plus iodoacetate in isotonic medium strongly indicates that energy failure per se does not suffice to induce cell swelling. Cell swelling in cerebral ischemia in vivo thus is likely to require additional mechanisms, most likely an increase of membrane permeability to Na+, which may be caused by release and accumulation of excitotoxins such as glutamate or by an extracellular release of K+. Such a mechanism would hardly influence the extracellular homeostasis in vitro due to the large medium-to-cell volume ratio. The findings demonstrate, nonetheless, the significance of a competent energy metabolism to support cell volume regulation. This is concluded from the failure of regulatory volume decrease of hypotonically suspended glial cells in anoxia plus iodoacetate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Either phenoxybenzamine (0.5 mg/kg body wt) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was given i.v. immediately after ischemia was induced to examine the drugs' effects on cerebral and renal hemodynamics. One hour after ischemia, cerebral blood flow was markedly reduced to 5, 3, and almost 0% of the preischemic value in the untreated, phenoxybenzamine-treated, and propranolol-treated rats, respectively. In contrast, renal blood flow at that time was decreased to 65, 88, and 67%, respectively. The calculated renal vascular resistance was similarly increased to 151% in the untreated and 136% in the propranolol-treated rats, but decreased to 82% in the phenoxybenzamine-treated rats. The present results indicate that in acute cerebral ischemia renal blood flow was considerably decreased with concomitant increased renal vascular resistance, and that such reduction in renal blood flow was minimized by alpha-adrenergic blockade but not by beta-blockade. It is concluded that activation of the alpha-adrenergic system in acute cerebral ischemia causes renal vasoconstriction.\r"

This therapy involved continuous mobilization of a bedridden patient by means of a specially designed rotating bed. All patients with acute stroke presenting to the Neurology Service over an 18-month period were screened, and those that qualified were assigned to confinement in either a routine hospital bed or a rotating bed. We found that the most common complication of stroke with bed confinement of 4 days or longer was bacterial infection consisting of either pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infection. The two variables found to be of greatest significance in affecting the rate of infection were length of bed confinement, especially for greater than 13 days (2.3-fold increased risk, p less than 0.04), and placement in a routine hospital bed (2.9-fold increased risk, p = 0.023).\r"

EEG was recorded continuously. All CBF areas of interest over one hemisphere reacted in the same way. Mean flow increased during short-term exposure to stable xenon and decreased if stable xenon inhalation was continued for at least 24 minutes. EEG showed a decrease of alpha- and beta-wave patterns a short time after the start of stable xenon inhalation without further changes over the period when rCBF finally decreased. CO2 reactivity increased in most animals, and autoregulation to mild arterial hypotension was significantly impaired with increased flow. It is concluded that 35% stable xenon in artificial air increases rCBF after short-term exposure and decreases rCBF after longer exposure. EEG changes were noted after short-term exposure. rCBF and EEG recovered rapidly after the end of stable xenon inhalation.\r"

Distribution, transfusion, and outdate data for 99,251 units of blood were collected from representative hospitals within the region served by the Atlanta Regional Red Cross Blood Center. Factors evaluated included: neonatal transfusion of type O blood to type A recipients; use of type O blood in emergencies or due to group-specific shortages; demographic donor and recipient differences; and blood importing practices. Of 43,757 group O units (44.1% of total) available for distribution, 2050 (4.7%) were outdated, compared with 3908 (10.7%) of 36,501 group A units (36.8% of total). One thousand two hundred and seventy-nine units of type O blood were transfused to recipients who were not type O, including 842 group A neonatal patients. A larger inner-city hospital, where 46.8 percent of recipients were group O and 29.2 percent were group A, accounted for 180 more group O and 509 fewer group A transfusions than would be expected if donor-recipient ABO distributions were the same. Three hundred and seventy-four more group A units were imported than were needed. ABO-mismatched transfusions due to shortage or emergency were insignificant. It was concluded that increased use of group O blood for neonatal transfusions, donor-recipient differences in blood group frequencies, and blood importing practices are the major factors that increase the rate of group A outdating.\r"

The impact of these combined factors on the rheologic behavior of sickle cell suspensions and on guidelines for transfusion has not been explored fully. Therefore, the eta of mixtures of washed normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red cells was determined in a rotational viscosimeter as a function of the hematocrit level of SS cells (HS), HT, oxygen tension (PO2), and shear rate. The ratio HT:eta can be taken as an index of potential oxygen delivery. The optimal HT (for maximum HT:eta) became progressively higher as the HS or the HS:HT ratio was lowered: at a given HT, HT:eta rose with a decrease in HS, especially at low HS values. These data support the concept that simple transfusion alone is not as beneficial to the patient as exchange transfusion and that substantial benefit can be obtained by bringing the patient to very low HS levels. The finding that eta rose with HT more steeply when the HS:HT ratio rather than HS was held constant suggested that the absolute level of HS may be more useful than the HS:HT ratio as a guide for a transfusion regimen.\r"

The correlation of log ferritin with ZPP was relatively poor (r = -0.580) but significant (p greater than 0.01). However, a ZPP level of 2.0 micrograms per g Hb or greater (upper limit of normal for first-time female donors) showed a predictive value of 0.85 for a ferritin level of 12 ng per ml or less in these donors. The correlation of hemoglobin concentration with ZPP level was significant (r = -0.667; p less than 0.001) in blood donors with ferritin levels at or below 12 ng per ml. ZPP level appears to be increased in iron-depleted (hypoferritinemic) blood donor in whom animals had developed or was developing (Hb less than 12.5 g/dl). Although direct measurements of venous hemoglobin and ferritin levels most accurately evaluate such blood donors, these tests are time-consuming and expensive and are currently not adaptable to bloodmobile operations. Copper sulfate screening has proved feasible in the bloodmobile setting, and the measurement of ZPP level has been used for mobile screening for lead poisoning. ZPP may be an inexpensive and useful screening test to determine a subset of donors who should receive supplemental iron or reduce their frequency of blood donation.\r"

All patients had an approximately threefold rise in IgG level. Five patients showed no change in lymphocytotoxic antibody (LCTAb) activity and no response to random donor platelets that were administered after the immune globulin. The activity of LCTAb either disappeared or diminished after immune globulin infusion in two patients, and they had borderline acceptable corrected count increments 1 hour after transfusion of pooled random-donor platelet transfusions. Because of the diminished LCTAb activity, the improvements in response to pooled random-donor platelet transfusions cannot be ascribed to the administration of immune globulin. High-dose intravenous immune globulin has not been shown to be effective in reversing the effects of alloimmunization.\r"

Cell counts, differentials, and committed myeloid (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotent (CFU-MIX or CFU-GEMM) progenitor cell assays were performed. Collection efficiency for progenitor cells, the number of cells collected divided by the number in the blood processed, did not diminish significantly. The number collected in the second 1.5-hour period resembled the number collected during the first. Circulating numbers did not fall significantly during apheresis. Prolongation of apheresis collections may reliably increase the number of progenitor cells available for eventual hematopoietic reconstitution.\r"

To remove heavier cellular elements, a 400-ml platelet pooling bg with tapered sides and a pouch at the base was designed to trap these cells after centrifugation. Two versions of this bag were tested: the initial prototype with a 3-ml pouch and a modified version with a 4-ml pouch. Platelet concentrates were pooled in batches of 6 per bag and, after sampling, were centrifuged between 186 and 600 x g for 7 to 10 minutes. The pouch on each bag was then clamped off, and samples from the primary bag were withdrawn so tht the percentage of cellular elements remaining could be determined. At optimal centrifugation conditions (390 x g for 10 minutes) with the initial prototype of the bag, average cellular decreases were: leukocytes, 75.9 percent; red cells, 84.1 percent; and platelets, 9.8 percent. Twenty-two components prepared in this manner were infused into 12 patients with histories of febrile transfusion reactions. Febrile reactions were markedly reduced or absent in ten patients, a strong febrile reaction due to incorrect component preparation occurred in one, and a marked allergic reaction occurred in one. The 4-ml pouch gave much better production results with greater than 95 percent leukocyte removal and less than 5 percent platelet loss. This system removes sufficient leukocytes from platelet concentrates that the risk of febrile transfusion reactions is reduced significantly.\r"

  ".W": "A recent publication suggested that the 24-hour allowable shelf-life of apheresis platelet concentrates collected by open-system techniques be extended to 48 hours because platelets collected in this fashion usually remain sterile for that length of time. The current studies, however, show that the quality of platelet concentrates deteriorates rapidly after storage for more than 24 hours in the relatively small-volume, polyvinyl chloride containers of currently marketed, open-system software, as evidenced by the falling pH, the disintegration of platelets, and the inability of platelets to recover from hypotonic shock. Platelets were markedly defective within 48 hours. Thus, it seems unwise to extend the shelf-life of such platelet concentrates beyond 24 hours solely because they are likely to remain sterile. Collection techniques and software must also be modified to ensure satisfactory platelet quality before the period of storage should be extended.\r"

The reinfarction group was characterized by lower tissue plasminogen activator activities in plasma euglobulins (p less than 0.05), significantly higher plasma concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator antigen (p less than 0.002) and a tendency to a higher plasma level of plasminogen activator inhibition capacity.

  ".W": "Nocturnal urinary melatonin excretion was evaluated in six patients with nightmares and hallucinations during treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, and compared to six control patients with similar diagnoses and treatment but without such symptoms from the central nervous system (CNS). Nightly melatonin excretion was lower in all cases with nightly CNS-symptoms than in the control patients. The results also suggest drug differences and dose dependency. It is concluded that in predisposed patients CNS side-effects induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are related to depressed nightly melatonin secretion.\r"

By means of logistic regression, three key-questions were selected. A combination of an affirmative answer to \"difficulty in swallowing solid food\" and to \"pain in the chest\" or \"heartburn at night\" or both did not occur in the group of normal subjects, while occurring in 68% of the patients with esophageal diseases. The combination occurred in only 10% of the patients with angina pectoris and 15% of those suffering from gastroduodenal ulcer or gallstones. The predictive accuracy of the combination of the three questions is estimated for various hypothetic prevalences of esophageal disease. These questions appear to identify approximately two-thirds of individuals with esophageal disease with acceptable false-positive rates and can therefore be used in epidemiological studies.\r"

In the first cohort the proportion of men and women on drug treatment increased from 61 and 77% at age 70 to 90 and 97% at age 82. The average number of drugs among those on treatment increased from 3.1 (men) and 3.4 (women) to 3.9 and 5.4, respectively. The most common drugs at age 70 were anxiolytics (20 and 29%), diuretics (15 and 29%), analgesics (12 and 20%), and digitalis (13 and 14%) and at 82 years of age analgesics (39 and 56%), anxiolytics (27 and 49%), diuretics (26 and 42%), and laxatives (19 and 28%). The second examined cohort used more drugs mainly at age 75 than the first cohort. The longitudinal follow-up of the first cohort indicated an overmortality mainly among men on drug treatment at ages 70 and 75. The patients' knowledge of the indications for the treatment was often weak and at age 82, 25% of the patients were unaware of the indications for one or more of the drugs.\r"

Twenty-one patients who were treated with chemotherapy combination (M-2 protocol: melphalan, vincristine, BCNU, cyclophosphamide, prednisone) plus plasma exchanges for three days at the start of each 5-week cycle survived longer (median 17 months, p less than 0.01) than 16 patients who were treated with melphalan-prednisolone alone (median 2 months). However, better supportive care, dialysis, and improved antibiotic treatment may also have contributed to the improved results. It is concluded that intensive chemotherapy in full dosage, plasmapheresis, and active uremia treatment including dialysis should be considered in patients with advanced myeloma and renal failure.\r"

Although he looked muscular he complained of muscular weakness and fatigue. Oral treatment with a local anesthetic, mexiletin, inhibited the pain in the lipomas. Analysis of the speech disorder in our patient and his children revealed disturbances in the coordination of jaws, larynx and tongue with a poor control of pitch and volume and impaired intelligibility. The poor fine coordination of hands, clumsiness when walking, dysarthria and disturbance of eye-movements could be due to a familial malformation in the pons or cerebellum. Computer tomography and X-ray of head were normal but the grooves on the surface of the cerebellum were more marked than usual.\r"

Out of 10,000 men invited to a screening examination in a large primary prevention trial in Goteborg, Sweden, 25% did not come to the examination. The non-participants could be shown to be registered by the Board of Social Welfare for social problems and alcohol abuse to a greater extent than the participants in the study. The annual mortality among the non-participants was about twice that of the participants during the entire follow-up period of 11.8 years. The incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction was not significantly higher in non-participants. Coronary death, on the other hand, was significantly more common among those not attending the examination (3.5 vs. 7.6%). Participants registered for alcoholic problems had coronary death rates approaching those of the non-participants. Sudden coronary death accounted for most of the excess coronary mortality. Most of the excess mortality in the non-participant group was from other causes than cardiovascular diseases and cancer but even so, about one third of the excess deaths could be attributed to coronary heart disease. Possible explanations of this excess coronary mortality include that non-participants may smoke more, more frequently have alcoholic problems and that non-participation may reflect an unwillingness to seek medical care even in the event of illness.\r"

They were comparable regarding baseline characteristics. Rest pain did not develop in any of the non-smokers. In smokers the cumulative proportion with rest pain was 16% after seven years (p less than 0.05). The cumulative proportions with myocardial infarctions after 10 years were 11 and 53%; the cumulative rates of cardiac deaths 6 and 43%; and the 10-year survival 82 and 46% among non-smokers and smokers, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analyses the association between smoking and infarction (p less than 0.05) and cardiac death (p less than 0.05) was significant. The survival curves deviated and when they were compared after one year's follow-up the association between smoking and mortality was significant (p less than 0.05). The findings provide further evidence for the fact that it is of utmost importance that patients with intermittent claudication stop smoking.\r"

In patients without angina at rest, the prolonged hyperventilation test was negative in 10/10 patients on calcium antagonist treatment (group A + B) and in 4/5 patients without medication (group C). The test was positive in 1/1 patient with angina at rest without medication (group D). However, the test provoked vasospastic angina in 1/5 patients who were asymptomatic without medication. In both the latter patients the prolonged hyperventilation test became negative after the restart of calcium antagonist treatment. During a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range 16-19) after the control hyperventilation test, no relapse of angina at rest, arrhythmias, syncopes, deaths or myocardial infarctions were registered. Thus, a negative test is compatible with low disease activity and/or efficacy of calcium antagonist treatment. Further, the test may reveal a subclinical tendency to coronary artery spasm.\r"

The age-adjusted incidence of haemorrhagic and thrombotic stroke (430-433) declined during the period 1970-1975 from 221 to 139 cases/100,000 inhabitants, whereafter no further decrease was observed. The decline in incidence was significant in both sexes. Analysis by diagnosis group showed that the decrease was confined to the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke (430-432), whereas the incidence of thromboembolic stroke (433, 434) and transient ischaemic attacks (435) remained virtually unchanged. Survival was mainly determined by patient age and type of CVD. Intracerebral haemorrhage and occlusion of precerebral arteries exhibited the poorest short-term prognosis. About half of the patients hospitalised due to cerebral thrombosis and embolism survived over one year. Long-term prognosis of the major CVD groups was very poor with only 10% of the patients alive after eight years. Transient cerebral ischaemia and subarachnoid haemorrhage had a clearly better prognosis, the survival rates after eight years being 45 and 30%, respectively.\r"

The lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in lipoprotein depleted pig plasma increased the abnormally low cholesteryl ester content of the fish eye disease HDL particles from about 20 to 100% and increased their exceptionally small mean particle size, probably by particle fusion, to a range which is representative of normal HDL3. Both esterification and particle enlargement were totally blocked by the LCAT inhibitor. Incubation of concentrated fish eye disease HDL with autologous lipoprotein depleted plasma for 24 hours at 37 degrees C resulted in a small increase in its cholesteryl ester percentage to 37%, without affecting the apparent HDL particle size. This finding confirms a deficiency of HDL lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (alpha-LCAT) in fish eye disease. The observed normalization of both HDL cholesteryl ester percentage and particle size by lipoprotein depleted pig plasma which contains virtually no cholesteryl ester transfer activity indicates that the latter is not a requisite for esterification of the free cholesterol of fish eye disease HDL.\r"

We have, therefore, investigated 23 male patients who had undergone highly selective vagotomy for ulcer 4.3 +/- 1.2 years previously. The 25OHD concentrations were decreased (p less than 0.05), the 1,25(OH)2D concentrations elevated (p less than 0.05) and the immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentrations normal. Local and total bone mass were normal compared to age-matched men, and there was no biochemical evidence of increased bone turnover. We suggest that the changes in calcium absorption, which are described in the literature after vagotomy, are mediated by 1,25(OH)2D. Although the changes in vitamin D metabolism do not lead to calcium-metabolic disturbances in selected patients, we believe that some will eventually develop vitamin D deficiency and that vitamin D supplementation should be considered.\r"

The endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions were apparently normal, supporting that the pancreatitis was secondary to the hypertriglyceridemia. After successful lipid-lowering therapy the attacks of abdominal pain disappeared and remained absent during a 13-year follow-up period. The other twin died of ischemic heart disease nine years after the discovery of his lipid abnormality. The reduction of his lipid levels had been much less successful. His average \"atherogenic index\" (the ratio of cholesterol in low density to that in high density lipoproteins) was normal but increased to a very high value if cholesterol in very low density lipoproteins was also included together with the low density ones in the numerator.

Repeated plasma exchange at intervals of 1-3 weeks simultaneously with combined drug treatment decreased the plasma cholesterol levels by nearly 40%. There were also signs of regression of xanthomata and some improvement of his angina pectoris. No progression of atherosclerosis was seen angiographically after two years treatment.

A sensitive radioimmunoassay has been developed to detect human and nonhuman primate cardiac troponin-I in serum down to 10 ng/ml. Immunochemical cross reactivity with skeletal troponin-I was only 2% and was species nonspecific. Normal patient levels of cardiac troponin-I are about 10 ng/ml. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (n = 32), serum cardiac troponin-I was elevated within 4 to 6 hours, reached a mean peak level of 112 ng/ml (range 20 to 550 ng/ml) at 18 hours, and remained above normal for up to 6 to 8 days following infarction. Peak cardiac troponin-I correlated with peak creatine kinase (CK) MB isoenzyme (r = 0.75). In subjects (n = 34) with skeletal muscle damage (total CK = 338 to 5384 IU/L), cardiac troponin-I levels were not elevated above normal, although CK-MB isoenzyme was elevated in some patients. Cardiac troponin-I levels were normal or slightly elevated in patients with ischemic heart disease and were normal in patients with chest pain of noncardiac origin. Immunoassay of cardiac troponin-I could be a valuable diagnostic aid in the cardiac-specific detection of cell necrosis.\r"

Thrombotic occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery was produced by electrolytic (100 microA anodal current) injury to the intimal surface of the circumflex coronary artery at the site of a noncircumferential stenosis in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital to have open-chest surgery. Intracoronary streptokinase, 6000 IU/kg in 3 ml saline solution, was infused at 0.05 ml/min for 1 hour, beginning 30 minutes after the formation of an occlusive thrombus. The animals were assigned randomly to two groups. In group I (n = 10) the intravenous infusion of vehicle was begun simultaneously with the intracoronary administration of streptokinase and continued for 2 hours after thrombolysis had been achieved. The animals in group II (n = 10) received intravenous CGS 13080 (1 mg/kg/hr) along with intracoronary streptokinase. Infarct size was assessed by a dual perfusion technique with Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium stains to demarcate the normally perfused myocardium from the area at risk and the infarct zone within the risk region. The two groups did not differ with respect to baseline coronary blood flow, time to the development of coronary artery thrombotic occlusion, or time to achieve thrombolysis. Oscillations in coronary blood flow were more frequent in group I than in group II (group I, 9 +/- 2.2; group II, 4.4 +/- 0.8 oscillation/min X 100, p less than 0.05 [mean +/- SEM)].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Early studies suggested that digitalis exacerbated ischemia (ST segment data); however, there are no studies assessing the effect of this agent on anatomic infarct size with the use of a risk zone technique. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess quantitatively whether digitalis extends necrosis in a model of coronary artery occlusion. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to 6-hour occlusion and, 30 minutes after occlusion, were randomized to digoxin (250 micrograms bolus/5 min intravenously, n = 9) or saline (n = 9) groups. At 6 hours, in vivo area at risk was determined by monastral blue dye injection and area of necrosis was assessed by tetrazolium staining. Heart rate and blood pressure were not different between groups before treatment or at 6 hours after occlusion. Left ventricular dP/dt was similar in both groups before occlusion (2350 +/- 293 mm Hg/sec digoxin vs 1839 +/- 122 mm Hg/sec saline, p = NS), but after 6 hours of coronary occlusion, had increased in the digoxin group to 2583 +/- 340 mm Hg/sec while it decreased in the saline group to 1517 +/- 128 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05 between groups at 6 hours), suggesting that digoxin increased contractility. Area at risk was 17.7 +/- 1.3% of the left ventricle in the digoxin group and 20.9 +/- 2.0% of the left ventricle in the saline group (p = NS). Area of necrosis, expressed as a percentage of area at risk, was 90.0 +/- 3.5% in the digoxin group vs 88.6 +/- 2.1% in the saline group (p = NS). Therefore, during acute myocardial infarction, digitalis confers a moderate increase in contractility without extending necrotic damage.\r"

These values were the most disparate in the women and younger men. The serum total cholesterol, the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol, and the serum triglyceride level were significantly related (p less than 0.05) to the 3-year cardiovascular mortality rate for men less than 55 years of age (univariate relationships). For men older than 55 years, these relationships were not statistically significant.

We therefore evaluated the effects of different heart rates on arrhythmias following canine coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Dogs were paced at either 350 msec cycle length (171 bpm; n = 30) or 480 msec cycle length (125 bpm; n = 30). They were then subjected to a 20-minute occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by sudden reperfusion. Ligated vessel perfusion bed size (myocardial \"at risk\") was measured with monastral blue and red dyes. The incidence of both occlusion and reperfusion arrhythmias correlated with the myocardium at risk. Dogs paced at 171 bpm had more ventricular ectopic depolarizations (37/1000 beats vs 8/1000 beats, p less than 0.01) and a higher incidence of ventricular tachycardia during occlusion than those paced at 125 bpm (67% vs 33%, p less than 0.05). Dogs paced at the faster rate also had a higher incidence of ventricular tachycardia (83% vs 60%, p = 0.08) and ventricular fibrillation (70% vs 40%, p less than 0.05) after reperfusion. Thus, heart rate can have a substantial effect on occlusion and reperfusion arrhythmias and should be considered when making therapeutic interventions and risk assessments in this setting.\r"

Serial two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed beginning early after the onset of chest pain and continuing until 10 to 14 days after admission. An area of apparent infarction was identified on each initial study based on later correlation of ECG and echocardiographic findings. Wall motion of infarct-and noninfarct-related areas was graded in a semiquantitative fashion based on the scoring of a visual analysis. Sequential image data demonstrated significant spontaneous improvement in wall motion of the infarct area in non-Q but not in Q wave events. Patients with non-Q wave infarction and improvement in regional function were at high risk for recurrent infarction within 6 months. Improvement in wall motion inside or outside the area of infarction in Q wave events was related to future risk. We concluded that in patients with initial acute myocardial infarction, failure to develop Q waves correlated with return of function in the apparent area of infarction. Improvement in regional wall motion after the initial study suggested risk for future ischemic events in both ECG types of myocardial infarction. Serial echocardiographic imaging may be a means to identify patients at risk for infarct extension in both non-Q and Q wave events.\r"

Intravenously administered procainamide was localized in normal, ischemic, and necrotic myocardium in 23 dogs. Rabbit antiprocainamide antibodies were used in an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex staining method. Normal myocardium demonstrated diffusely positive immunostaining for procainamide, as did the cardiac conduction system and vascular endothelial cells. Necrotic myocardium demonstrated markedly reduced to absent immunostaining. By contrast, in regions of myocardial ischemia without necrosis, immunostaining for procainamide was similar to that in the normal myocardium. Procainamide myocardial tissue levels were reduced in necrotic and ischemic zones compared to normal (p less than 0.05) only in those animals in which procainamide was administered after rather than before the onset of coronary occlusion. The demonstration of the absence of drug binding in the necrotic cells suggests that myocardial tissue levels or radiolabelled assessment of drug distribution can be misleading when nonhomogeneous tissue is sampled. The immunohistochemical technique provides additional information about the regional and cellular distribution of procainamide that is complementary to the information obtainable by radiolabelling microspheres and from biochemical assays.\r"

There was a greater increase in QRS duration during ventricular tachycardia and ventricular pacing than during sinus rhythm (p less than 0.005). By electropharmacologic testing, pirmenol was judged effective in six patients (40%) and was proarrhythmic in one (6%). In the nine patients in whom pirmenol was judged ineffective, the cycle length of induced VT increased by 36 +/- 15% and the associated mean arterial pressure increased by 21 +/- 14 mm Hg. The only side effects were mild hypotension and mild nausea in one patient each. Intravenous pirmenol has type IA electrophysiologic effects. It can be administered safely to patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and is as effective as approved antiarrhythmic drugs when assessed by electropharmacologic testing.\r"

We performed this study in order to determine: (1) the safety of electrical shocks applied to the RAFW and (2) the early and late anatomic effects of ECA. Twelve beagle puppies, ranging in age from 2.0 to 7.5 months and weighting 2.3 to 8.0 kg, underwent electrical ablation of the RAFW, using energy doses of 100 to 400 J. At the highest energy doses tested (400 J), one puppy died of refractory ventricular fibrillation and one of low cardiac output. Atrial perforation and cardiac tamponade occurred in two puppies, each of which received one shock of 200 J. The area of myocardial damage following ECA shocks of 150 J was greater than for shocks of 100 J, 94 +/- 14 vs 56 +/- 11 mm2, respectively (p less than 0.02). Acutely, ECA produced transmural hemorrhagic necrosis. Eleven weeks after electrical ablation, atrial fibrosis was apparent at the site of ablation. In conclusion, ECA may be used to fulgurate atrial tissue in the RAFW. We recommend 150 J as a safe upper limit in small subjects, although higher energy doses may not produce cardiac perforation or adverse hemodynamic effects in larger subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical ablation techniques (ECT) have had limited success in achieving control of arrhythmias originating in the right atrial free wall (RAFW). To ascertain determinants for successful ECT, we studied the clinical and cellular electrophysiologic effects of electrical ablation of the RAFW. After performing electrical ablation of the RAFW in 12 beagle puppies, the following studies were performed: Holter monitoring first 24 hours (eight puppies), and 11 weeks later (four puppies); clinical electrophysiologic study (four puppies); and microelectrode study (ME) (eight puppies). Arrhythmias (AR) and conduction disturbances (CD) frequently occurred immediately following ECT: ventricular tachycardia (VT) (seven puppies), junctional tachycardia (one puppy), and asystole or complete AV block (AVB) (four puppies). Holter monitoring during the first 24 hours after ECT revealed VT (four puppies), frequent ventricular premature depolarizations (one puppy), and type 2 second-degree AVB (four puppies). AR were rarely seen late after ECT. During clinical EP study 11 weeks after ablation, atrial fibrillation was induced in three of four puppies; none had AR prior to ECT. Early ME study revealed a nonhomogeneous atrial infarct--a central zone of \"dead\" cells surrounded by peripheral islands of depressed cellular activity. Cells with normal action potential characteristics were noted in between. We conclude that Electrical ablation of the RAFW is associated with a high incidence of early AR and CD. Because of the nonhomogeneous nature of tissue injury produced during ECT, careful atrial mapping is critically important. Local regions of conduction delay and block may provide a substrate for the late development of atrial arrhythmias.\r"

ST-T changes were found as frequently in asymptomatic patients (29%) as in those symptomatic (27%), and did not identify those with hemodynamic sequelae of MVP (apical systolic murmurs, Doppler-defined mitral regurgitation, or left atrial enlargement). QT prolongation was found more frequently in the symptomatic group (25% vs 10%) but did not predict syncope.

Doppler measures of the ratio between early and late filling were significantly depressed in patients with LV hypertrophy and correlated inversely with age in the normal subjects. The M-mode derived normalized peak rate of chamber enlargement and the Doppler-derived normalized peak filling rate correlated weakly, but significantly, when both groups were combined (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01).

In a model of chronic Adriamycin cardiotoxicity in rats, T1 values of excised hearts were elevated, relative to control, in rats with histologic evidence of chronic cardiotoxicity (651 msec vs 622 msec, p less than 0.05) and more so in rats with gross evidence of toxicity or heart failure (668 msec, p less than 0.005). No significant change in T2 was observed. This T1 prolongation increases as disease worsens, whereas water concentration did not change significantly. The results suggest that predictable prolongation in T1 occurs in association with cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, proton nuclear magnetic resonance imaging methods could provide a new means for assessing Adriamycin cardiotoxicity.\r"

The postextrasystolic changes in the aortic pressure pulse, global left ventricular function, and quantitative regional left ventricular wall motion were investigated. PESP caused an increase in the peak systolic aortic pressure (116 +/- 17 to 130 +/- 25 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), a decrease in the peak diastolic aortic pressure (74 +/- 12 to 61 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), a decrease in preejection period/left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) ratio (0.637 +/- 0.136 to 0.457 +/- 0.097, p less than 0.001), and an increase in the global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (0.26 +/- 0.09 to 0.40 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.01). Postextrasystolic changes in LVEF were inversely related to changes in PEP/LVET (r = -0.76, p less than 0.05). The postextrasystolic patterns of the regional wall motion of the left ventricle were different in each patient. The results of this study suggest that residual left ventricular function can be detected in patients with IDC by their response to PESP.\r"

Ten myotonic dystrophy patients (seven men and three women, ages ranging from 35 to 58 years) were evaluated with a 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitor recording, invasive electrophysiologic studies, and echocardiographic examination. Nine patients displayed abnormalities in the conduction system. ECG and Holter monitor abnormalities were first-degree atrioventricular block (n = 8), second-degree atrioventricular block (n = 1) (Wenckebach type), complete left bundle branch block (n = 2), left anterior fascicular block (n = 5), left posterior fascicular block (n = 1), sinus bradycardia (n = 6), sick sinus syndrome (n = 2), frequent premature ventricular complexes (n = 4), and ventricular tachycardia (n = 2). Electrophysiologic study abnormalities included AH interval less than or equal to 140 msec (n = 7), AH interval greater than 140 msec (n = 3), HV interval greater than 60 msec (n = 9), and ventricular tachycardia induction (n = 1). Echocardiographic examination revealed mitral valve prolapse (n = 6). We conclude that diffuse conduction abnormalities were seen in a majority of our patients with myotonic dystrophy. Ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, were seen in some of these patients, and mitral valve prolapse was a frequent finding.\r"

In both sexes, at all ages, all-cause, cardiovascular, and coronary mortality rates increased progressively in relation to antecedent heart rates determined biennially. A more impressive association to cardiovascular disease was observed in men than in women, which was independent of associated cardiovascular risk factors. Case fatality rates following coronary events also increased with antecedent heart rate and the fraction of coronary deaths as sudden death increased strikingly with heart rate in men 35 to 64 years of age. There was also a substantial excess of noncardiovascular deaths at high heart rates, and the proportion of all deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease did not increase with heart rate. The excess cardiovascular deaths with more rapid heart rates were also noted, excluding those with interim overt cardiovascular disease, suggesting an effect independent of preexisting cardiac damage.\r"

  ".U": "87238347\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the EP mechanisms underlying efficacy and inefficacy of transvenous cardioversion shocks in 13 patients with coronary artery disease and sustained VT during preoperative and intraoperative cardiac mapping procedures. Shocks were delivered at the right ventricular apex with a Medtronic 6880 catheter and a Model 5350 external cardioverter/defibrillator with two or three electrode configurations, resulting in unidirectional or bidirectional shocks, respectively. Single transvenous shocks with incremental energies ranging from 0.03 to 25 J were delivered in sinus rhythm and VT, and simultaneous right and left ventricular electrograms were obtained. Transvenous cardioversion shocks of 0.03 J in sinus rhythm and VT produced immediate local right ventricular depolarization and subsequently conducted to distant right ventricular and left ventricular sites after 30 to 100 msec. Shocks of 0.05 to 0.5 J produced immediate depolarization of progressively larger right ventricular and left ventricular regions, with shocks greater than or equal to 0.5 J producing immediate depolarization of distant left ventricular sites in sinus rhythm. High energy (greater than 5 J) shocks produced instantaneous depolarization of multiple right ventricular and left ventricular sites in VT. VT termination occurred due to either delay or interruption of conduction in the tachycardia circuit, despite prior depolarization of the early sites of ventricular activation during the QRS complex. This could be due to instantaneous or paced depolarization of critical \"excitable\" components of the VT circuit, resulting either in immediate conduction block or in instability followed by termination. VT acceleration with transvenous cardioversion was due to modification of the \"excitable,\" slowly conducting components of the VT circuit with the development of new areas of conduction block, along with altered intraventricular conduction. Similar EP mechanisms were observed with unidirectional and bidirectional transvenous shock patterns. We conclude that transvenous shocks alter conduction in human ventricle, and clinical effects of QRS synchronized shocks are related to conduction changes induced in the excitable components of the VT circuit.\r"
