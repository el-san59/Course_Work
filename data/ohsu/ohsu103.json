  ".U": "87319656\r", 
  ".W": "The validity of mouse liver tumor end points in assessing the potential hazards of chemical exposure to humans is a controversial but important issue, since liver neoplasia in mice is the most frequent tumor target tissue end point in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. The ability to distinguish between promotion of background tumors versus a genotoxic mechanism of tumor initiation by chemical treatment would aid in the interpretation of rodent carcinogenesis data. Activated oncogenes in chemically induced and spontaneously occurring mouse liver tumors were examined and compared as one approach to determine the mechanism by which chemical treatment caused an increased incidence of mouse liver tumors. Data suggest that furan and furfural caused an increased incidence in mouse liver tumors at least in part by induction of novel weakly activating point mutations in ras genes even though both chemicals did not induce mutations in Salmonella assays. In addition to ras oncogenes, two activated raf genes and four non-ras transforming genes were detected. The B6C3F1 mouse liver may thus provide a sensitive assay system to detect various classes of proto-oncogenes that are susceptible to activation by carcinogenic insult. As illustrated with mouse liver tumors, analysis of activated oncogenes in spontaneously occurring and chemically induced rodent tumors will provide information at a molecular level to aid in the use of rodent carcinogenesis data for risk assessment.\r"

To a good approximation, this probability of generalization (i) decays exponentially with this distance, and (ii) does so in accordance with one of two metrics, depending on the relation between the dimensions along which the stimuli vary. These empirical regularities are mathematically derivable from universal principles of natural kinds and probabilistic geometry that may, through evolutionary internalization, tend to govern the behaviors of all sentient organisms.\r"

Simple serologic tests that unambiguously distinguish among infections by these retroviruses are essential. To that end, a partially conserved immunoreactive epitope was identified in the transmembrane glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2. Synthetic peptides derived from these conserved domains were used in sensitive and specific immunoassays that detect antibodies in sera from patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2. By making single amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 peptide, it was possible to demonstrate HIV-1 strain-specific antibody responses to this epitope. Such custom-designed peptides synthesized from this domain are likely to detect newly discovered HIV types, define infection with specific HIV strains, and allow detection of group-common antibodies.\r"

Mutations that affect the ability of the envelope glycoprotein to form syncytia in CD4+ cells can be divided into five groups: those that decrease the binding of the envelope protein to the CD4 molecule, those that prevent a post-binding fusion reaction, those that disrupt the anchorage of the envelope glycoprotein in the membrane, those that affect the association of the two subunits of the envelope glycoprotein, and those that affect post-translational proteolytic processing of the envelope precursor protein. These findings provide a functional model of the HIV envelope glycoprotein.\r"

Complex devices such as total joint replacements and the total artificial heart represent combinations of polymers and metal alloys for system and organ replacement. The major barriers to the extended use of these devices are the possibility of bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, which causes biomaterial-centered infection, and the lack of successful tissue integration or compatibility with biomaterial surfaces. Interactions of biomaterials with bacteria and tissue cells are directed not only by specific receptors and outer membrane molecules on the cell surface, but also by the atomic geometry and electronic state of the biomaterial surface. An understanding of these mechanisms is important to all fields of medicine and is derived from and relevant to studies in microbiology, biochemistry, and physics. Modifications to biomaterial surfaces at an atomic level will allow the programming of cell-to-substratum events, thereby diminishing infection by enhancing tissue compatibility or integration, or by directly inhibiting bacterial adhesion.\r"

Current craniofacial techniques allow extensive orbitocranial reconstruction, which can be done safely in infants and in older children as well. These techniques have produced excellent cosmetic results and are routinely used in craniofacial centers.\r"

Sclerotherapy of varicose veins is an established procedure. Injection with the patient in the upright position followed by mild short-term compression is a simple method to achieve the desired results, but is reserved for treatment of collateral varicose veins more than 4 mm in diameter. Obliteration of intracutaneous telangiectasia and small subdermal veins of the legs, face, and trunk can be done safely by injecting a 0.1% solution of sodium tetradecyl sulfate through a 30 or 32 gauge needle directly into the lumen of the vessel. Slow intraluminal injection has resulted in uniformly good to excellent results in more than 350,000 puncture sites. By combining surgical and sclerosing techniques, maximal functional and cosmetic results can be obtained by removing or obliterating venous channels.\r"

  ".U": "87319818\r", 
  ".W": "Retroperitoneal injury caused by penetrating trauma or associated with progressive shock following blunt trauma is usually recognized promptly and managed appropriately. Isolated retroperitoneal injury from blunt trauma, unless accompanied by major hemorrhage or gross hematuria, is often difficult to diagnose and needed treatment may be delayed. Although clinical examination remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, the high incidence of ethanol abuse and/or concurrent head injury in trauma patients has led to increased use of computed tomography in the diagnosis of abdominal trauma. To determine the effect, if any, of CT examination on the diagnosis and management of retroperitoneal trauma, we reviewed our patient experience. During the 16-month period ending in April 1986, 135 patients sustained 177 retroperitoneal injuries (116 by blunt and 19 by penetrating trauma). There were 26 deaths (19% mortality). There were 90 pelvic fractures and 31 lumbar spine fractures, as well as 21 genitourinary, 12 gastrointestinal, five pancreatic, and eight major vascular injuries. Ten patients had isolated retroperitoneal hematomas. We conclude that (1) patients with retroperitoneal injuries and coexisting intraperitoneal injuries should have early operation; (2) isolated retroperitoneal trauma tends to lead to observation unless CT is used as part of the early assessment; and (3) routine use of CT in patients at risk accurately defines the extent of injury and enhances clinical management.\r"

Alternative methods of care for such patients (for example, hospice care) may be more appropriate and less costly. The role of physician characteristics in determining use of resources for terminal patients is compared with that of care setting (type of facility), using data from the National Hospice Study. Multiple logistic regression reveals a stronger relationship between care setting and resource utilization than between physician \"aggressiveness\" and utilization. Physician specialty has little effect on utilization. These findings suggest that care setting may influence physician practice behavior. This may be due to self-selection of particular types of physicians or patients, or to a characteristic of the facility itself.\r"

A characteristic signal pattern was found in hemangiomas (n = 11), with marked signal hyperintensity on T2 and proton weighted images as compared to normal liver tissue. Cysts (n = 7) also showed marked hyperintensity on T2 images, but could easily be differentiated by a lesser intensity on proton weighted images and signal hypointensity on T1 weighted images. Primary liver tumors (n = 4), metastatic liver disease (n = 18), focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 5), and liver adenoma (n = 1) revealed a weak signal hyperintensity on T2 images, with varying signals in T1 and proton weighted modalities. These data combined with other recent communications in the literature indicate that MRI is a promising diagnostic technique in the detection of focal liver lesions and that it may offer a high degree of specificity in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas and benign cysts.\r"

Among both white and nonwhite farmers in South Carolina, the PMR was significantly higher for cerebrovascular disease (whites, PMR = 1.20, P less than .05; nonwhites, PMR = 1.43, P less than .001) and lower for all malignant neoplasms (whites, PMR = 0.86, P less than .05; nonwhites, PMR = 0.78, P less than .001). In addition, external causes of death were elevated, attaining statistical significance for white farmers (PMR = 1.51, P less than .001). Significantly lower PMRs for all malignant neoplasms are attributed to fewer deaths from cancers related to smoking (buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, lung, and bladder) and colon and rectal cancers among both white and nonwhite farmers. White farmers did not show significantly elevated PMRs for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic systems found in other studies in the Midwest. These data suggest that agricultural life-style can be improved for the prevention of strokes and for external causes of death.\r"

Each simulator was interviewed by three student interviewers who were part of six groups of ten to 12 students, each group led by a physician. All sessions were audiotaped, and a coding system was developed. The completeness of response, new unscripted items, and accuracy of information provided by the simulators were measured using the audiotape sessions as sources of data. In addition, the degree of accuracy of the affect of each simulator was assessed by faculty and students in written case histories. The results of the study show that multiple simulators are an effective way of promoting active learning and of teaching basic clinical concepts and skills. Teams of standardized patients give students a consistent learning experience when there are constraints of student group size, time, and scheduling simulations within a traditional curriculum.\r"

Paraplegia and incontinence occurred in all animals after 14-27 days (median, 23 +/- 3.0 days). Autonomic dysfunction and a measurable increase in tumor volume were documented with the use of computer tomography. The tumor penetrated the vertebral bone, invaded the epidural space, and gradually compressed the lumbar spinal segments. Electron-microscopic examination revealed dilated intermyelin spaces containing exuded homogenous material and extravasated leukocytes and erythrocytes. Myelin breakdown was accompanied by the presence of lipid-laden macrophages. Sequential recording of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) revealed a progressive increase in the latency of the cervical responses, which preceded the onset of clinical signs. In the presence of paraplegia, spinal cord conductivity was abolished. The levels of the prostaglandins TXB2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and PGE2 were measured in the compressed and remote spinal cord segments during the presymptomatic and symptomatic periods. Only PGE2 was significantly elevated (P less than 0.001) in the paraplegic rats, all along the spinal cord segments. A significant increase in water content was measured in the compressed lumbar segments in the presymptomatic period, and when paralysis set in it was increased in the adjacent low thoracic area as well. Tissue specific gravity was significantly increased only in paraplegic rats in the compressed (P less than 0.01) and the adjacent low thoracic areas (P less than 0.05) but no significant change occurred during the presymptomatic period. Multiple mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of neurologic symptoms in neoplastic spinal cord compression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve patients had incomplete spinal cord injuries that were classified on a neurologic function scale (Sunny-brook) immediately and 3 months after injury. Spirometric tests were done within 1 week of halo vest fixation, after 3 months of treatment, and 1 week after dismounting of the halo vest. The results showed that initial vital capacity was smaller than predicted normal in all patients and 30% less in neurologically impaired patients. Both groups improved during the treatment and somewhat more after removal of the halo vest. In neurologically intact patients, the halo vest caused a respiratory restriction of 10%, which was fully regained after removal of the halo vest. The difference between the groups remained throughout the study. There was no evidence that the halo vest itself affects the vital capacity more in patients with incomplete cord lesions than in neurologically intact patients. All of the cervical spine injuries healed uneventfully.\r"

Correction for the factors analyzed only slightly reduced the correlations between spinal mobility and LPB. Thoracolumbar mobility had higher correlations with LBP than mobility of the lumbar spine.

They showed concentric narrowing of the spinal canal in extension and widening with relief of nerve root involvement in flexion. This could be attributed to the presence of marked degenerative hypertrophy of the facet joints, narrowing the available space for dural sac and emerging root sleeves. In extension of the lumbar spine, bulging of the disc toward the hypertrophic facets causes a pincers mechanism at the anterolateral angles of the spinal canal with the risk of bilateral root compression. This mechanism is enhanced in these cases by marked dorsal indentation of the dural sac because of anterior movement of the dorsal fat pad in extension. The authors believe that the radiologically described mechanism forms the anatomic basis of neurogenic claudication and posture-dependent sciatica.\r"

In this report these new mechanisms are reviewed and their contribution to vertebral stability assessed. The thoracolumbar fascia consists of two principal layers of dense fibrous tissue that attach the abdominal muscles to the vertebral column. Each of these layers was dissected in fresh and fixed material and samples chosen for light and scanning electron microscopy to study the arrangement of the component fibers. Computed axial tomography in volunteers showed the changes in spatial organization that occur during flexion of the back and during the Valsalva maneuver. The fascia was then tensed experimentally in isolated unfixed motion segments. The results suggested that the stabilizing action of the thoracolumbar fascia is less than had been thought previously but was consistent with calculations based on the more accurate structural and mechanical information that had been derived from the current study. Abdominal muscle contraction was simulated in whole cadavers in both the flexed and lateral bending positions to compare the stabilizing effect of the thoracolumbar fascia and intra-abdominal pressure mechanisms. These definitive experiments showed that the resistance to bending in the sagittal plane offered by the abdominal muscles acting through fascial tension was of a similar magnitude to that offered by a raised intra-abdominal pressure, both being relatively small in the fully flexed position. The stabilizing influence of the middle layer of the thoracolumbar fascia in lateral bending was clearly demonstrated and warrants further study in vivo.\r"

Primary radiation therapy in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer is associated with a small but definite cure rate. Better definition of treatment volume, proper selection of dose-time, state-of-art treatment planning, and, whenever possible, intraoperative radiation have improved local control rates and decreased severe complications.\r"

A number of brachytherapy radiation techniques have been developed to deliver localized radiation in higher doses without exceeding surrounding normal tissue tolerance. Intraluminal radiation with brachytherapy techniques consists of implantation of radioactive pellets into the tumor through a rigid or flexible bronchoscope or the use of afterloading removable implants with remote afterloading techniques. These procedures can be combined with laser therapy to obtain effective palliation and long-term tumor control. Initial results appear promising.\r"

  ".W": "The International Staging System for Lung Cancer provides for classification of six levels of disease extent in five stage groups that relate to patient management and prognosis. Stage 0 is reserved for patients with carcinoma in situ. The Stage I and II definitions provide for classification of two levels of disease extent completely contained within the lung that have different prognostic and therapeutic implications. Definitive resection is the first choice of therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in these stage groups. The Stage II category takes into account the erosion of survival expectations in the optimum group of T1 and T2 patients as a consequence of intrapulmonary lymph node involvement. Although small cell carcinoma is infrequently encountered as Stage I and Stage II disease, these classifications may be useful in the structure of investigational programs involving adjuvant surgery. The exclusion of distant metastases and the division of Stage III into two levels of extrapulmonary disease allow for selection of patients for specific treatment plans. Patients with non-small cell tumors with Stage IIIa disease usually are candidates for definitive surgical treatment. The specificity of the T and N definitions in the Stage IIIa and IIIb categories identifies patients for whom particular radiotherapy treatment plans are structured and protocol assignments are made. It is consistent with patient management concepts that all those with distant metastases are classified as having Stage IV disease. Implications of the system for selection of surgical, radiotherapeutic, and chemotherapeutic regimens are rational for all cell types. The classification meets the requirement for simplicity and can be readily applied in a broad spectrum of clinical and teaching environments. It is, however, sufficiently specific to be useful for reporting results of investigational therapies. Prospective use of the classification should encourage precision in clinical evaluations that exploit full use of refinements in imaging technologies. The cooperative efforts of the Task Force on Lung of the AJCC and the TNM Committees of the UICC to bring this classification system to fruition and international acceptance have been described. It has been adopted by these groups and others, including the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the Japanese Cancer Committee, and the Spanish Society of Respiratory Disease, as their official recommendation for staging lung cancer.\r"

It is clear that radiation therapy can prevent local recurrences. In addition, chemotherapy prolongs survival but systemic recurrences--especially in the brain--remain the major obstacle to improved cure rates.\r"

Forty-nine patients underwent complete resection of all intrathoracic disease, with a median survival of 17 months, 3-year survival of 21 per cent, and 5-year survival of 9 per cent. Thirty-three patients underwent pulmonary resection with simultaneous iodine-125 interstitial implantation or iridium-192 delayed afterloading to areas of unresectable primary or nodal disease, with a median survival of 12 months, 3-year survival of 22 per cent, and 5-year survival of 22 per cent. One hundred and one patients underwent interstitial implantation without resection, with a median survival of 11 months, 3-year survival of 9 per cent, and no 5-year survivors. Forty-two patients had incomplete resection without intraoperative radiation therapy and fared no better than a cohort group of 44 unoperated patients with clinical evidence of mediastinal invasion--both groups had a median survival of 8 months and no 3-year survivors. An aggressive surgical approach with pulmonary resection and/or brachytherapy appears to offer some survival advantage to this group of patients. In particular, 5-year survival rates ranging from 7 to 15 per cent were observed in subsets of intraoperatively treated patients with invasion of pulmonary vein, phrenic nerve, esophagus, or pericardium and in those with clinically occult T3 disease.\r"

A decreased tendency in the occurrence of metastasis to the intrathoracic lymph nodes was observed histologically in the group exposed preoperatively to radiation. A significant decrease in the occurrence of metastasis to the intrathoracic regional nodes in patients with carcinoma of the middle part of the thoracic esophagus was observed (p less than 0.02). A significant increase in the occurrence of metastasis to the intra-abdominal lymph nodes was observed in the patients receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.01).

A series of 56 patients undergoing hepatic resection at a single institution from 1974 to 1985 are presented. Resection was carried out in 27 women and 29 men who ranged in age from 23 to 87 years (a mean of 56 years). The site of primary disease was: colorectal in 41, adrenal gland in two and other sites in 13. Of the 56 hepatectomies, 21 were done for synchronous secondary disease discovered before or at operation for the primary disease. Metachronous lesions were found in 35 patients, from two months to 17 years (a mean of 34 months) after excision of the primary tumor. Estimated five year survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier method was 25 per cent in the patients with colorectal primaries and 35 per cent in the entire group. No difference was demonstrated between synchronous and metachronous resections. Patients with multiple hepatic lesions did much poorer than those with solitary tumors. Patients with metastatic tumor consisting of one large lesion with surrounding satellite nodule or nodules had an expected survival time resembling that for those with true solitary metastases and were included in that group. No difference in survival time was observed in patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum who had involvement of regional nodes at the time of the primary resection, as compared with patients with negative nodes. Hepatic resection for a secondary malignant growth can be performed safely with a real chance for cure in selected instances. We continue to recommend an aggressive approach to hepatic metastases, especially those of a colorectal origin.\r"

In the curative instances, 52 of 74 patients (70.3 per cent) without esophageal invasion survived for five years, while 14 of 52 patients (26.9 per cent) with esophageal invasion survived: The prognosis of patients with esophageal invasion was poor regardless of the presence or absence of metastases to the lymph nodes. No patient who underwent noncurative resection survived for five years. To elucidate the high risk factors of esophageal invasion, a proportion of patients with esophageal invasion was statistically compared with patients without esophageal invasion, according to clinicopathologic factors. High risk factors included anatomic location, advanced disease and Borrmann IV type in gross appearance, more than 5 centimeters in diameter, positive serosal in filtration and positive metastases to the lymph nodes. Histologic type and mode of invasion did not relate to the esophageal invasion. The patients with high risk factors had a significantly poorer prognosis than did those without high risk factors. The results of the present study clearly show that high risk factors for esophageal invasion have an untoward effect on the rate of curative resection and the prognosis after removal of a lesion from the upper third part of the stomach.\r"

This drug has been considered for use as an adjunct to surgical repair after topical application upon peripheral and central nervous system structures. In vivo and in vitro studies were done using rats to study the dose dependent neurotoxicity of this water soluble chemical. The results indicate that when the neural sheaths are removed the amplitude of the evoked sciatic nerve potential is irreversibly suppressed from 1 to 10 mM concentrations of beta APN. Nerve conduction velocities are relatively less affected with reduction from 43 to 35 m/sec by beta APN immersion. Similarly, the spinal cord studies show that when the dura and arachnoid are opened and damaged, 0.1 mM beta APN causes increased latency (from 9.9 to 14.5 msec) and decreased amplitude (from 79.4 to 56.8 microV) of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. Possible mechanisms for the neurotoxic effects of beta APN are discussed.\r"

After carotid ligation, the gerbils were divided into four groups: controls, which breathed air at ambient pressure; group 1, which received hyperbaric oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute pressure (ATA) for 36 hours, with a 5-minute, 1.5-ATA air break each hour; group 2, which received hyperbaric oxygen at 1.5 ATA for 1 hour alternating with 1 hour air at 1 ATA, for 36 hours; and group 3, which received hyperbaric oxygen at 1.5 ATA with hourly 5-minute air breaks for 18 hours, and ambient air for the second 18 hours. Neurological evaluations and staining of the brain with tetrazolium revealed the following results at 36 hours after carotid ligation: 72% of the controls had cerebral infarcts; 26% of the gerbils in group 1 had infarcts, but all animals died at 24-36 hours after beginning hyperbaric oxygen exposure from oxygen toxicity; 44% of the gerbils in group 2 had infarcts; 11% of the gerbils in group 3 had infarcts during the first 18 hours after carotid ligation, and no infarcts developed in the 18 hours that followed. Hyperbaric oxygen reduces the incidence of cerebral infarction after carotid artery ligation, presumably by allowing time for collateral circulation to develop.\r"

  ".W": "Instability of the spine caused by metastatic spread of primary tumors represents a serious risk for spinal cord or nerve root compression. In order to restore stability and relieve neural compression, a variety of surgical techniques originally used for reduction of nonpathologic spinal fractures have been applied to the problem of spinal metastases. Recently, we have utilized a technique developed primarily for correction of scoliosis to the treatment of metastatic spinal fractures. Six patients with spinal instability and neural compression secondary to metastatic tumors had segmental spinal stabilization with Luque rods, sublaminar wiring, and methyl methacrylate. Restoration of stability was successful in all cases with alleviation of preoperative pain and return to full activity. No evidence of instability occurred in this group of patients. As demonstrated by this experience and that of a few other small series, Luque rod stabilization provides a valuable addition to the techniques available for stabilization of metastatic fractures of the spine. Although the precise role of Luque rod segmental spinal stabilization in treatment of metastatic disease of the spine continues to be defined, thus far it has proved beneficial for cases of multiple vertebral body involvement or instability beyond one vertebral level.\r"

Availability of the scan altered surgical management in nine patients (47%) who required resection of nodes in addition to resection of adjacent nodes. The discovery of metastatic disease in one patient was clearly attributable to lymphoscintigraphy. This demonstrates the unpredictable lymphatic anatomy of this region and suggests that preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may be useful in directing the surgical management of cutaneous melanomas in which lymph node dissection is planned.\r"

We also include three patients who had surgery elsewhere but who underwent dilations at our institution. Fourteen had stenoses complicating gastric bypass with Roux-en-Y anastomoses, and eight had stenoses complicating a gastroplasty (gastrogastrostomy). Two different types of dilation were attempted during the interval reviewed--Fogarty balloon dilations and Gruntzig balloon dilations. None of the eight patients with gastroplasties benefited from the attempted dilation, but 10 of the 14 patients with stenoses complicating gastric bypasses have done well. We found no significant difference between Fogarty and Gruntzig balloon dilations. We conclude that balloon dilation is an effective means of treating stenosis that complicates gastric bypass performed with Roux-en-Y anastomoses in cases of morbid obesity.\r"

In a review of 100 consecutive cases of local excisions in patients with soft tissue sarcomas, which were performed at the National Cancer Institute, we identified factors associated with the development of wound-related morbidity. The incidence of these wound complications, which include infection, seromas, and skin loss, was 34.4%. Serious complications that necessitated rehospitalization or reoperation occurred in fewer than 10% of the patients. Preoperative factors associated with wound morbidity were patient age greater than 40 years (P2 less than 0.029) and tumor in the lower extremity (P2 less than 0.014). Treatment-related factors associated with morbidity were increased blood loss (p less than 0.01) and an increased volume (p less than 0.006) and duration (p less than 0.002) of wound drainage. The complications significantly delayed the start of adjuvant radiation therapy and lengthened the hospital stay. Measures to prevent these complications are discussed.\r"

The patients all had large localized tumors, no history or clinical evidence of decreased food intake or weight loss, and had received no prior treatment for cancer. Indirect calorimetry (for REE), K40 analysis (for BCM), and anthropometric measurements (for BF) were performed in accordance with established methods. Physical activity and nutritional status were also assessed. As expected, female control subjects had 50% greater percent BF (p less than 0.001) and 13% less percent BCM (p less than 0.01) than male controls. Male patients with sarcoma had equivalent percent BF, but significantly less percent BCM than controls matched for age, sex, and body surface area (BSA) (p less than 0.05). The REE corrected for BSA was similar in male and female controls but was 25% greater in male sarcoma patients than in male controls (p less than 0.05). This difference was doubled when REE was corrected for BCM (p less than 0.01). In patients with sarcomas, REE/BSA varied inversely with percent BCM (r = -0.782; p less than 0.05) while a similar relationship was not observed in healthy volunteers. We conclude that both REE and vital, functional BCM can be significantly altered in sarcoma patients before any overt signs of cachexia develop. The results support the contention that sarcoma alters host energy metabolism and causes abnormal body composition.\r"

The computer was no more accurate than an experienced clinician in the prediction of morbidity. In the prediction of mortality, however, the computer was far more accurate than the clinician. Clinical prediction of mortality was associated with a risk ratio of 3.2, a critically elevated K value with a risk ratio of 21.7, and an elevated mortality index with a risk ratio of at least 70. In conclusion, both measures have some use in providing objective measures of stratification among patients with jaundice. The mortality index is also useful in the determination of a program for clinical management and, in particular, the timing of any surgical intervention.\r"

The influence of blood transfusion on the growth of a transplantable B16 melanoma was examined in nude (athymic) CBA mice and immunocompetent C57 BL/6J mice. Recipients were given infusions of saline solution or syngeneic or H-2-incompatible allogeneic blood transfusions on two occasions 3 days apart. Infusions were begun 10 days before inoculation of a single cell suspension of B16 melanoma. Growth was determined by measurements of primary tumor volume and tumor weight after excision. There was no statistically significant difference in tumor size or weight between the three recipient groups of athymic mice. However, immunocompetent mice given H-2-incompatible allogeneic blood had higher rates of tumor engraftment--saline solution recipients versus allogeneic recipients: chi 2 = 13.2, df = 1, p less than 0.001; syngeneic recipients versus allogeneic recipients: chi 2 = 2.97, df = 1, p greater than 0.05. In the allogeneic group significantly larger and heavier tumors developed than in mice given syngeneic blood or saline solution. The study indicates that H-2-incompatible allogeneic blood transfusions can influence the growth of a transplantable murine tumor by a mechanism that involves a cell-mediated immune response.\r"

Difference in pressure between the abdominal and thoracic cavities was considered to lead to ascites in the chest via the diaphragmatic triangular area (where there is no parietal peritoneum).

After short-term observation of 11 implanted grafts, 57 adult mongrel dogs underwent superior vena caval replacement with these Teflon grafts. Cepharanthin (2 mg/kg daily) and RAD (10 mg/kg daily) were administered after surgery to 28 and 14 animals, respectively. Dogs were killed at 12 days to 6 months after graft implantation. Fifteen dogs served as controls. In the cepharanthin-treated group, three grafts exhibited luminal obstruction with severe intimal hyperplasia, but smooth, semitransparent thin neointima was recognized in 25. The endothelial cell lining of the neointima exhibited excellent spread 2 months after implantation. Although one graft was obstructed with hyperproliferative fibrosis in the RAD-treated group, a well-developed neointima with complete coverage of endothelial cells was confirmed in 14 dogs. With regard to the rate of occurrence of luminal obstruction, these data were significantly different from those of the control group, which suggests that intimal hyperplasia can be reduced by treatment with antiplatelet agents.\r"

  ".W": "The choice of therapy--whether medical or surgical--for patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is often a subject of debate. After a period in which surgery was almost the exclusive mode of treatment in patients with severe complications resulting from GER or in patients who did not respond to medical therapy, long-term follow-up showed that in 20 cases of GER in which only medical treatment was given, a progressive shortening of the esophagus--frequently in the absence of esophagitis--had developed. To investigate the pathophysiology of acquired short esophagus, we studied 34 patients--20 from the initial group and 14 who already had this condition. Clinical assessment consisted of interview, radiologic examination of the upper digestive tract, endoscopic and histologic examinations, and 24-hour home esophagogastric pH monitoring. We noted that acid GER causes shortening in the presence of severe mucosal lesions, while \"nonacid\" GER--a combination of gastric, pancreatic, and hepatic secretions--causes shortening of the esophagus even without evident mucosal lesions. Symptom evaluation, acid GER pH recording, and endoscopy are not sufficient for determination of the current choice of therapy. It is also important to quantify GER that results from the mixing of gastric and biliopancreatic secretions with use of the esophagogastric pH recording. This should reduce the possibility of silent shortening of the esophagus.\r"

The obvious question remained: Would this agent be as effective if administered after the onset of the shock syndrome? Thus 72 anesthetized dogs were subjected to normotensive hemorrhagic shock and were subsequently treated with FDP at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 90 minutes, and 2 hours after exsanguination. Analysis of the results (as compared with vehicle-treated controls) revealed evidence of improved cardiac output and arterial pressure (p less than 0.02), conservation of effective circulatory volume, better oxygen utilization, and a significant increase in survival (p less than 0.0001). These results, in conjunction with earlier experimental and recent clinical data, indicate that the therapeutic effect of FDP in ischemic and hypoperfusion states is in part metabolically mediated by the augmentation of carbohydrate utilization. Prevention of tissue injury is in part due to the inhibition of generation of oxygen-derived free radicals by neutrophils.\r"

The beneficial effects of this resuscitation, which are still controversial, were attributed to cellular uptake of ATP--it was assumed that cell membranes are permeable to this substrate. The effect of a high concentration of ATP in extracellular medium on intracellular ATP content was studied by using red blood cells (RBCs) from rabbits in control (normal) and in hemorrhagic shock states. The glucose-depleted RBCs were incubated in medium with 5 mMol/L ATP, and their ATP concentration fell markedly to the same level as seen in glucose-depleted RBCs incubated without ATP. The decrease of ATP in glucose-repleted RBCs, incubated with or without ATP, also did not show any significant difference. Similar to parallel experiments that used normal RBCs, the high extracellular ATP content did not substantially affect the intracellular ATP concentration in RBCs from animals in shock. This study indicates that ATP molecules in extracellular medium cannot penetrate either the normal RBC membrane or the RBC membrane during shock.\r"

For endarterectomies performed on asymptomatic patients (n = 155), major morbidity included 2 myocardial infarctions and 1 stroke (1.9%). There were 3 fatalities--2 myocardial infarctions and 1 stroke (1.9%). For the symptomatic group (n = 234), major morbidity was 2.1%, mortality 2.6%. The combined morbidity for asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis was 2%, mortality 2.3%. Perioperative stroke rate (morbidity plus mortality) was 2.6%, 9 ipsilateral to the carotid endarterectomy, suggesting distal embolism as its probable cause. We contend that quality control measures implemented to correct the unacceptable rates reported in 1978 have contributed to dramatic and sustained reductions in complication rates.\r"

The mean Rankin disability score (Grade 1, no disability, through Grade 5, severe disability) changed from 1.7 before stroke to 2.8 in survivors at hospital discharge; 29% of those discharged required further institutional care. The level of disability in survivors remained relatively constant from 6 months after stroke through 5 years of observation. Of the 112 patients with an admission score of 5, 40 (36%) were alive at 1 year and only 5 of those (13%) improved to relative independence (Rankin scores of 1 or 2). The most common comorbidity contributing to disability was cardiovascular disease (31%). After the first 18 months, the mortality in patients with stroke was similar to that in a normal population having the same age and sex distribution. Of the 251 1-week survivors, 132 (53%) had rehabilitation (physiatrist) evaluations, 127 (51%) received physical therapy, 103 (41%) received occupational therapy, and 33 (13%) received speech therapy. Thirty-four of the 132 patients (26%) referred for rehabilitation evaluations were transferred to the rehabilitation unit.\r"

In-hospital evaluations for these 65 follow-up patients found that 9 patients (14%) had symptom clusters of major depression, 12 patients (18%) had symptom clusters of dysthymic or minor depression, and 44 patients (68%) did not meet the DSM III diagnostic criteria for depression. Although overall prevalence of depression did not change significantly over time, the prognosis for individual patients, depending on diagnostic group, was different. All of the follow-up patients with major depression in-hospital were improved by 2 years, with a significant reduction in their mean depression scores and improvement in their activities of daily living, whereas only 30% of follow-up patients with dysthymic depression improved by this time. There was no significant improvement in their mean depression scores or mean activities of daily living score. Of the patients followed up who were not depressed in-hospital, 34% had developed major or minor depression by 2 years, and their mean depression scores were significantly increased. These data suggest that the prevalence of depression among the follow-up patients remains high (between 30 and 40%) for the first 2 years after stroke, but that untreated poststroke major depression has a natural course of about 1-2 years, with associated improvement in activity of daily living scores, whereas the prognosis for poststroke dysthymic depression is frequently unfavorable and often persists for greater than 2 years.\r"

The case fatality rate was 23%, higher than for any other location of brain infarction studied over the same period. Death was most often due to concomitant brainstem infarction. Obstructive hydrocephalus occurred in 4 patients (13%), and in 2 cases diagnosis, facilitated by urgent CT scanning, allowed early surgical intervention that was life saving. Patients who survived the acute phase were followed for an average of 21 months, and over that time 22% sustained further brainstem infarction, representing a 13% stroke rate per year. Over the latter 3 years of the clinical study, an autopsy survey revealed 11 cases of cerebellar infarction that had been clinically unrecognized. None of these died as a direct result of their infarction. Mechanisms of infarction inferred from autopsy included in situ thrombosis, embolism, watershed, and lacunar infarction, with in situ thrombosis being the most common. We conclude that the case fatality rate of cerebellar infarction is greater than of any other form of brain infarction, but it may be reduced by prompt recognition of those patients who will benefit from surgical decompression. In survivors, a high risk of subsequent hindbrain stroke exists. More attention needs to be paid to this entity in terms of early diagnosis and prevention of subsequent stroke.\r"

One of the 36 patients had a definite peripheral vascular embolus. Thus, 6 of 36 consecutively identified patients with atrial septal aneurysm (17%) had definite embolic events and 8 of 36 (22%) had definite or possible embolic events. The cause of the association between atrial septal aneurysm and emboli is unknown. While aneurysm-associated thrombus has been suggested, the high proportion (90%) of patients with interatrial shunting demonstrated by contrast echocardiography in this study suggests paradoxical embolization as a potential cause. Whatever its mechanism, the high prevalence of embolic events in this series strongly supports the premise that atrial septal aneurysm is a cardiac abnormality with embolic potential.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical outcome of 40 cases with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was examined in relation to the site of occlusion and the findings on computed tomography (CT). Patients were treated conservatively without surgery. A few had decompressive craniotomy when necessary. Outcome in 7 (18%) was good, in 6 (15%) moderate, and in 15 (38%) severe; 12 (30%) died by the follow-up at 3 months. In cases with occlusion at the origin of the MCA, hypodensity on CT scan was usually localized to the basal ganglia, presumably because of collateral circulation through the anterior cerebral arteries; the outcome in these patients was not always favorable. Cases with occlusion of the trunk or branch vessels always showed marked CT hypodensity, and clinical outcome was poor. To assess quantitatively the extent of collateral circulation, the conduction time of contrast medium from the intracranial siphon (IC) to the insular portion of the MCA (M2) through the anterior cerebral arteries was calculated on serial carotid angiograms obtained within 24 hours after stroke onset. An IC-M2 time of 5 seconds was a critical indicator of whether extensive CT hypodensity would develop (the rule of 5 seconds). Furthermore, this method predicted the appearance and extent of infarction before CT revealed hypodensity. The significance of acute reconstructive surgery is also discussed.\r"

In a randomized study in vivo, we tested the following anti-free radical combination therapy administered at the beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after apnea-induced cardiac arrest of 7 minutes: 1) ventilation with 100% nitrogen for 30 seconds to allow the delivery of therapy before oxygen, 2) 10 mg/kg i.a. superoxide dismutase followed by 10 mg/kg i.v. over 1 hour to scavenge the superoxide anion radical, and 3) 20 mg/kg i.v. deferoxamine over 1 hour to prevent membrane lipid peroxidation. We evaluated the effects of this combined treatment on the recovery of cardiovascular variables, cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption, and somatosensory evoked potentials in 20 dogs 6 hours after resuscitation. Compared with standard treatment (n = 10), the combined treatment (n = 10) did not affect cardiovascular variables, significantly mitigated cerebral blood flow changes after cardiac arrest, and enhanced recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials. We conclude that oxygen free radicals play a role in the pathogenesis of the arrest-related derangements of cerebral blood flow and function that are effectively reduced by this combined treatment; we recommend evaluation of its components in outcome studies.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the association between carotid plaque hematoma and symptoms of cerebral ischemia a retrospective review of 200 consecutive carotid endarterectomies at the Neurological Institute of New York was carried out. Data analyzed included cerebral ischemic symptoms, angiographic findings, preoperative use of antithrombotic agents, and microscopic pathology of endarterectomy specimens. No association was found between ischemic symptoms ipsilateral to the endarterectomy and presence, size, or age of plaque hematomas. Plaque hematomas were less common among patients who took antithrombotic agents preoperatively than among those who did not. The presence of plaque hematoma was associated with angiographic carotid cross-sectional area stenosis of greater than 75%. Patients with stenosis of less than 75% were more likely than those with stenosis of greater than 75% to have ischemic symptoms ipsilateral to the endarterectomy, suggesting that criteria for surgical treatment of carotid atherosclerosis differ for those who are symptomatic vs. those who are asymptomatic. These results demonstrate the limitation of using a surgical series to extend causal inferences about the relation between plaque hematoma and cerebral ischemic symptoms to the general population of people with carotid atherosclerosis.\r"

The generalized and regional changes in blood flow after administration of acetazolamide were evaluated by the xenon-133 inhalation technique in a series of patients with subacute or chronic focal cerebral ischemia. Acetazolamide augmented interhemispheric asymmetry of cerebral blood flow in patients with unilateral occlusion of major cerebral arteries, whereas no significant side-to-side asymmetry was evident in patients with minor arterial lesions. Low flow areas in relation to computed tomography-verified infarcts tended to be larger after administration of acetazolamide. Hyperfrontality was present at rest and during stimulation with acetazolamide. A decline of cerebral blood flow with advancing age was greater in patients than in normal controls. The vasodilator response to acetazolamide did not change with age.\r"

The controls consisted of 12 subjects hospitalized for nonvascular neurologic problems and matched for age, sex, and risk factors to the transient ischemic attack patients. Collagen-induced platelet thromboxane B2 production, plasma beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinopeptide A were significantly higher in the patients than the controls. Platelet aggregability by collagen was the same in the 2 groups. Platelet hyperfunction and enhanced thrombin activity are present in patients some weeks after the acute episode, suggesting that the hemostatic system has a primary pathogenetic role.\r"

In 25 of the 31 patients, the acute infarct was deep. Leukoencephalopathy was more frequent in patients with a deep infarct (8%) than in patients in whom the cortex was involved (0.8%) (p less than 0.01). A history of progressive intellectual impairment (23%) and the finding of a mild or moderate impairment, or severe dementia (84%) were more frequent in study patients (p less than 0.05) than in 31 sex- and age-matched controls with an acute infarct of same size and topography but without leukoencephalopathy. A history of hypertension (81%) and high blood pressure on admission (166 +/- 19/96 +/- 12 mm Hg) were the most common risk factors and were more frequent in study patients (p less than 0.05) than in controls. On the other hand, study patients had a greater than or equal to 50% stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery (13%) less often than controls (35%) (p less than 0.05). Diabetes (23%), elevated blood cholesterol (13%), hematocrit greater than 45% (23%), smoking (32%), and myocardial ischemia by history or ECG (45%) did not differ. These findings suggest that hypertension may be more strongly associated with leukoencephalopathy than with deep infarcts. In acute stroke patients, leukoencephalopathy on CT should not be considered a fortuitous finding.\r"

By retrospective analysis, at least 4 of the 11 were demented. Of these, 3 had clinical evidence of Binswanger's disease--characterized by progressive dementia, incontinence, variable pseudobulbar signs, and acute and subacute motor deficits. Two additional patients suffered only transient ischemic attacks or lacunar strokes; 2 had syncope; 1 had multiple sclerosis. The remaining patients were neurologically asymptomatic. In this small retrospective series, the severity of CT changes did not distinguish the patients with clinical Binswanger's syndrome from neurologically less symptomatic patients. Ten of the eleven patients had disordered blood pressure regulation--hypertension, labile systolic pressure, orthostatic hypotension, or a combination of these factors. The severity of CT changes correlated more clearly with blood pressure instability than with clinical encephalopathy. Asymptomatic adult patients with unexplained CT white matter hypodensity and blood pressure disorders may, however, be at risk for the development of subsequent subacute arteriosclerotic encephalopathy.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism of the attacks, the regional cerebral blood flow was measured during rest and/or hyperventilation in children aged 3-16 with Moyamoya disease. Regional cerebral blood flow during rest was significantly higher in younger children with Moyamoya disease, and it progressively decreased with advancing age through childhood. During hyperventilation, regional cerebral blood flow decreased in all the children, although blood flow in younger children was still higher than that in the older children. Nevertheless, transient ischemic attacks were more readily precipitated by hyperventilation in the younger than in the older children. Cerebral metabolic demand is much higher in the first decade of life than in later decades. Therefore, it seems likely that even a moderate reduction in cerebral blood flow can cause metabolic impairment in young children. Such high cerebral metabolic demand may play an important role in the frequent occurrence of transient ischemic attacks in young children with Moyamoya disease.\r"

This method was used in combination with a recently developed radioimmunoassay for neuron-specific enolase in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from 47 patients with cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and head injury. In cerebrospinal fluid, increased concentrations of both S-100 and neuron-specific enolase were found after large infarcts, whereas after small infarcts and transient ischemic attacks, only neuron-specific enolase increased. The increased concentrations of S-100 and/or neuron-specific enolase were noted 18 hours to 4 days after cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attacks. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of these proteins also reflected the severity of the disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or head injury. Temporal changes in serum S-100 and neuron-specific enolase concentrations reflected the clinical course in 4 patients. In stroke patients, the S-100 and neuron-specific enolase concentrations may reflect the extent of brain damage and could be useful in selecting patients with major stroke for more aggressive treatment during the acute phase.\r"

Six cats were pretreated with infusion of 1.5 g/kg glucose prior to ischemia. Relative concentrations of high-energy phosphate metabolites and intracellular pH were continuously monitored before, during, and for 2 hours after cerebral reperfusion. During ischemia, intracellular pH fell to the same level and followed a similar time course in both groups. However, during initial reperfusion in the hyperglycemic group, there was a severe further decline (p less than 0.003) in intracellular pH. We suggest that the increased neurologic deficit and mortality found in hyperglycemic animals subjected to cerebral ischemia may be attributed to this transient severe tissue acidosis.\r"

This investigation evaluates the effect of acute angiographic contrast medium administration on the cortical edema induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Sixteen rats underwent MCA occlusion, and after 1 hour half the rats underwent ipsilateral internal carotid injection of meglumine diatrizoate, whereas the remainder underwent cervical internal carotid exposure only. Six rats had only sham operations on the MCA and internal carotid, and 4 other rats served as normal controls. Cortical specific gravity was measured to reflect cerebral edema 4 hours after occlusion or sham operation. Specific gravity of the lateral frontal cortex in the hemisphere ipsilateral to occlusion was 1.0396 +/- 0.0011 (mean +/- SEM) when no angiographic contrast medium was administered, significantly less (p less than 0.01) than in rats exposed to contrast medium (specific gravity 1.0442 +/- 0.0005). The latter value was not significantly different from normal. Other cortical areas on the side of the contrast medium injection were also relatively dehydrated compared with normal controls. Early meglumine diatrizoate administration after MCA occlusion results in a decrease in cerebral cortical edema, possible by inducing an osmotic gradient that draws water from the extravascular space.\r"

  ".W": "The changes in pial arterioles of 7 cats were examined by electron microscopy after injury that eliminates endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine or bradykinin. The injury was produced by exposing the vessels to mercury light in situ in the presence of intravascular sodium fluorescein dye. Previous studies showed that, at the time of initial injury and loss of endothelium-dependent responses, the endothelial cells displayed minimal ultrastructural evidence of injury. Because these changes might indicate the beginning of a sequence of irreversible alterations representing or leading to cell death, the present study was carried out 31/2-4 hours later, when ultrastructural evidence of progressive cell degeneration should readily be recognized. No such changes were observed. Instead, most vessels showed only the minimal alterations observed initially (endothelial vacuolation, blebs, and lucencies). Four of 19 vessels were completely normal. The findings fail to support the hypothesis that irreversible cell damage or death caused by the light + dye injury has caused the associated loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation. Rather, the findings support the concept that much lesser degrees of trauma are sufficient to impair the dilating responses of cerebral microvessels. This greatly expands the potential spectrum of pathologic states that might result in loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation.\r"

Both of these features have been considered important prognostic indicators in patients with pontine hemorrhage, but in our series benign outcomes were not restricted only to patients who were alert or had small hemorrhages; on the other hand, severe disability was noticed in 1 patient with a small hematoma strategically located in the pontine tegmentum.

Febrile reactions (66%) were most frequently reported, followed by moderate and severe allergic reactions (15%), and urticaria alone (19%). Washed platelets were prepared by an automated technique (IBM/COBE 2991). In vitro studies indicated no apparent adverse effects to the platelets due to the wash procedure, and in vivo studies demonstrated good platelet increments in 10 thrombocytopenic patients. Twenty-two patients with histories of platelet transfusion reactions received a total of 554 washed platelet transfusions. Washed platelets were not effective in reducing febrile transfusion reactions in 16 patients receiving 347 washed products. The efficacy of washed platelets in reducing transfusion reactions was demonstrated in six patients with histories of severe allergic reactions who received 207 washed products. Severe allergic reactions were completely alleviated in this group. In conclusion, automated platelet washing is simple and efficacious in preventing or reducing the severity of allergic reactions to platelet transfusions.\r"

  ".W": "Standard packed red cell (PRC) units can be depleted of leukocytes and platelets if they are transfused through a blood administration set in which the usual 170-mu filter has been replaced by a leukocyte removal filter (Sepacell R-500). During a 6-month period, 1550 PRC units were transfused through this filter in 611 transfusions to 80 multitransfused patients with thalassemia who had had a patient reaction rate (PRR) of 63 percent and a transfusion reaction rate (TRR) of 13 percent when given standard PRC or buffy-coat-depleted PRC. When given filtered PRC, PRR and TRR became 3.7 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. The effectiveness of the filter was also evaluated in vitro. By filtering 2 standard PRC units through the same filter, median values (and ranges) for red cell recovery and for residual leukocytes and platelets were 87 percent (83-92), 6.1 X 10(6) (0-100), and 2.7 X 10(9) (0.6-9.7), respectively. Although refinements are needed to improve standardization of the filter and to increase red cell recovery (which is low when 1 unit is filtered through one filter) and blood administration rate, the ability to provide leukocyte-free red cells prepared at the bedside for virtually all recipients appears to be a realistic goal.\r"

Six 1000-ml bags of 0.9 percent normal saline and lactated Ringers (RL) solutions were supercooled and tested separately at temperatures ranging from 1 to -78 degrees C, with either 5 or 30 units of packed red cells (PRBCs). The PRBCs were shipped in a standard military container that permitted separation of the supercooled solutions from the PRBCs. Cooling RL solutions to 6 degrees C and to -22 degrees C maintained acceptable storage temperatures of the PRBC for 36 and 50 hours, respectively, and did not cause visible damage to the units. No significant changes were observed in various biochemical measurements of the cells and plasma. Cooling the RL solution to -78 degrees C caused a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in plasma potassium concentration. The effectiveness of the crystalloid solutions in refrigerating blood varied with the ratio of the number of PRBCs to the volume of cooled solutions and with the ambient temperature surrounding the container. The results of this study suggest that cooled intravenous crystalloid solutions can be used as refrigerants for PRBCs during shipment.\r"

The purpose of this work was to investigate the metabolic and membrane changes affecting newborn red cells during their exposure to storage in citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) and citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1). The findings suggest that newborn red cells are affected more by storage than are adult cells. These accelerated storage changes in the red cells of newborns may be related indirectly to the rapid adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decline. As is the case with adult red cells, fetal cells withstand storage in CPDA-1 better than in CPD. The storage lesion in these cells was partly reversible, as in adult cells, by incubation with adenosine. It was therefore concluded that newborn red cells obtained from placentas and stored for several weeks in CPD or CPDA-1 media or other media that improve the metabolic profile of these cells may be acceptable for transfusion.\r"

The ratio of the 51Cr:99mTc value was 1.23. In this experiment we also calculated 51Cr RBC viability by both the single-isotope method (extrapolation) and the double-isotope method (using 125I human serum albumin for an independent plasma volume) in the same volunteers. The corresponding viability values were not significantly different. The simultaneous determination of autologous 111In-oxine RBC and 51Cr RBC viability at 24 hours was measured in 19 other normal volunteers whose RBCs had been stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1) for 1 or 15 days. The ratio of the 51Cr:111In value was 1.1. Use of these 24-hour viability ratios as conversion factors permits direct comparison of 99mTc or 111In RBC viability with a 51Cr standard, and therefore expands the application of these newer RBC radiolabels.\r"

In 3-I batches, the beta chains of hemoglobin were crosslinked with 2-nor-2-formylpyridoxal 5'-phosphate (NFPLP) that was synthesized on a gram scale. The coupling efficiency was 60 to 80 percent. The oxygen dissociation curve of these Hb/HbNFPLP mixtures was shifted to the right with P50 (PO2 for 50% saturation with oxygen) values of 26 to 38 torr versus values of 12 to 16 torr for the nonmodified hemoglobin solutions. Both the H+ Bohr factor and the Hill coefficient were lower for the Hb/HbNFPLP mixture than for the original hemoglobin solution. The oxygen-binding coefficient beta was the same for both types of Hb solutions. The viscosity and the colloid osmotic pressure of both solutions were also the same. During storage at 4 degrees C for 18 months, no precipitation or denaturation of hemoglobin was detectable in either solution. There was also no conversion of the modified hemoglobin molecules, HbNFPLP, to the native hemoglobin tetramers, dimers, or monomers. The percentage of methemoglobin remained at 5 percent for about 6 months; it increased to 26 percent over the next 12 months. The results indicate that intramolecular coupling of hemoglobin with NFPLP yields a stable product with physiologic oxygen-carrying properties.\r"

Clotted blood samples from 14 subjects were centrifuged at 280 X g for 10 minutes. Serum was tested immediately for baseline ALT levels and aliquots were stored at 22, 4, -20, and -80 degrees C. Additional serums were stored on the clot at 22 and 4 degrees C. ALT quantitation was performed at intervals of 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours and on Days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Unseparated tubes were sampled both proximal and distal to the red cells to determine ALT leakage from red cells lysis. For all storage conditions, gradual loss of activity occurred over time. Mean activity loss in separated serum at 2 days was 6 percent at 4 degrees C and 20 percent at 22 degrees C. Mean loss in unseparated serum was 3 percent at 4 degrees C and 12 percent at 22 degrees C. Marked ALT loss averaging 46 percent by day 6 occurred with storage at -20 degrees C, whereas storage at -80 degrees C resulted in an 8 percent decrease for the same period. For storage of up to 1 week, it is recommended that serum be separated early and retained at 4 degrees C. Frozen samples should be kept at -80 degrees C. Storage of separated or unseparated blood for up to 24 hours at 22 or 4 degrees C, as commonly found in blood centers, will marginally adversely affect the accuracy of ALT determination.\r"

  ".W": "New containers allow storage of platelet concentrates (PC) at 22 degrees C for up to 7 days, during which glycolytic and oxidative metabolism is vigorous. Recent evidence suggests that 85 percent of adenosine triphosphate regeneration is based on oxidative metabolism and that substrates other than glucose may be used. Because platelets can oxidize free fatty acids (FFA) as a possible source of energy during storage, the authors studied their availability, distribution, and turnover. Plasma FFA concentration was unchanged after 1 day of PC storage but significantly increased on Days 3, 5, and 7. Platelet-free plasma (PFP) stored under the same conditions as PC demonstrated a progressive increase in FFA, suggesting that some of the FFA accumulating in PC were derived from plasma rather than platelets. Indeed, during PC storage, plasma triglycerides decreased significantly, suggesting that they are a possible source of the increased levels of FFA found on Day 3 and thereafter. Thus, PC have a plasma FFA pool available continuously for oxidation during storage. Studies with radiolabeled palmitate suggested that FFA oxidation by platelets occurs during storage. The current findings show that plasma FFA could be a significant substrate for oxidative metabolism during storage of PC and that the oxidized FFA are replenished at least in part from plasma. These results may allow platelet storage to be improved, particularly in synthetic media.\r"

The glans penis was innervated by the dorsal nerve of the penis. In some patients dual innervation was present at the ventral aspect of the glans penis by the dorsal nerve of the penis and the perineal nerve. The predominant innervation and fiber spectra of the glans by the dorsal nerve of the penis and the crucial role of the glans in sexual arousal and erectile function provide adequate rationale for the measurement of nerve conduction velocity of the dorsal nerve of the penis in sexual dysfunction.\r"

Because our preference has been for immediate surgical intervention in such patients, a retrospective review was performed to ascertain the effect of partial or total nephrectomy. Eighty-eight patients met the criteria of multiple injuries including severe renal injuries (laceration, rupture, or pedicle injury) and availability of renal function data. Partial or total nephrectomy had been performed in 50 patients, renorrhaphy in 23, and 15 were managed without renal operation. In patients with renal lacerations, the numbers of associated injuries (including intra-abdominal injuries) were similar to those managed conservatively or by operation, and the rates of acute renal failure and mortality were the same with conservative management, renorrhaphy, or nephrectomy. Patients with renal pedicle injuries who had a nephrectomy did have a higher rate of acute renal failure than those managed conservatively (75% vs 0%; p less than 0.05), but they also had more associated injuries (2.8 vs. 1.6/patient; p less than 0.04) and they were older. These two factors, rather than the nephrectomy, probably accounted for the greater rates of acute renal failure and death.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was planned to evaluate sperm morphology as a parameter to predict the fertilization outcome in an in vitro fertilization program. Couples applying to in vitro fertilization were admitted into this project when the sperm concentration was greater than 20 million per mL and motility greater than 30 per cent. Based on new strict criteria for evaluating normal sperm morphology, patients were divided prospectively into 2 groups. In group I (25 patients) normal sperm morphology was less than 14 per cent, and in group II (71 patients) normal sperm morphology was greater than 14 per cent, using a threshold established previously. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate different parameters: concentration, motility, and morphology against the dependent variables, fertilization, and cleavage. The only factor which was significantly correlated with fertilization and cleavage was normal sperm morphology (P less than 0.0001). The fertilization rate (per oocyte) and the cleavage rate were 49.4 per cent and 47.6 per cent in group I and 88.3 per cent and 87 per cent in group II (P less than 0.0001). The ongoing pregnancy rate per laparoscopy and per embryo transfer was 4 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, in group I and 18.3 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively, in group II (no significant difference). This study demonstrates the value of analyzing sperm morphology using the criteria recommended in terms of predicting fertilization and perhaps pregnancy outcome. Patients can be better counseled and the probability of fertilization or no fertilization can be more accurately established. Furthermore a trend is shown in the pregnancy rate that may indicate the importance of the male genome in establishing a pregnancy.\r"

If bladder cancer is caused by agents present in the urine, as is widely believed, this mechanism may also protect against carcinogenesis. We performed the current study to determine whether suspected carcinogens or cocarcinogens in the urine gain access to the transitional cells by impairing or inactivating the surface antiadherence effect. Using an in vivo method to quantitate bacterial adherence to the rabbit bladder, we compared adherence in control and glycosaminoglycan-deficient bladders to adherence in bladders treated with one of several suspected urinary carcinogens. There were statistically significant differences between adherence in control bladders and adherence in bladders treated with the tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, sodium cyclamate, and sodium saccharin. These data indicate that perhaps certain suspected urinary bladder carcinogens inactivate the anti-adherence effect of the glycosaminoglycan layer at the bladder surface and thereby penetrate to the transitional cells to exert their tumorigenic effects; or they may serve as cocarcinogens that inactivate the glycosaminoglycan barrier and permit other urinary carcinogens to transform the transitional cells.\r"

However, using normal plasma depleted of HDL, leaving its combined VLDL and LDL as enzyme substrate, resulted in a more than twofold increase in the LCAT activity of FED plasma from the two patients compared to the activity obtained with HDL present in the incubation mixture, indicating an inhibitory effect of HDL on the beta-LCAT activity present in FED plasma. This inhibitory effect of normal HDL could also be demonstrated by autoincubation of FED plasma mixed with isolated HDL2 or HDL3. Both these HDL subfractions had a pronounced inhibitory effect on the cholesteryl ester formation in FED plasma. The present study thus clearly demonstrates that normal HDL inhibits the beta-LCAT activity present in FED plasma, esterifying the free cholesterol of combined VLDL and LDL, derived from controls as well as from the two FED patients.\r"

However, the small differences in age and sex distribution did not explain satisfactorily the considerably increased prevalence of MAC in the group of patients with SE. Our preliminary data indicated that thromboembolism caused by left atrial dilatation and atrial fibrillation might be the most important cause of the condition in patients with MAC and SE.

After two weeks of familiarization and controlled food intake, ensuring weight stability, the participants received 7 g of guar three times daily during two weeks. Patients were then followed during a 5-week wash-out period. There were no changes in body weight and body composition but total cholesterol decreased during guar treatment. Blood pressure measured at standing, supine and sitting positions decreased after two weeks of guar treatment by 9.8% systolic and 9% diastolic and did not revert to pre-treatment values until after three weeks of the wash-out period. There was also a decrease in both systolic (8%) and diastolic (7%) blood pressures during exercise on the ergometer bicycle at 50 and 100 W (4.6 and 4.7% respectively) submaximal work load. It is concluded that guar gum exerts a lowering effect on the blood pressure in moderately obese men even in the absence of any change in body weight. If confirmed in further long-term studies, guar may be a valuable alternative to pharmacological preparations in the treatment of mild hypertension.\r"

The second was at a later date, when there had been time to adjust to the decision-making process. There were 515 episodes of myocardial ischemia of which 174 were associated with pain and 341 were asymptomatic. Silent ischemia was significantly more frequent during the first period of monitoring compared to the second (p less than 0.02). Patients who had more silent ischemia on the first occasion also entered more self reports of \"emotional upset\" (tension, worry, etc.,) in their diaries compared to the second occasion. The level of urinary cortisol was taken as a measure of uncertainty and worry, and was significantly higher on the first occasion (p less than 0.03). Differences in urinary noradrenaline excretion were taken as a measure of subjective stress. Patients who excreted more noradrenaline on the first compared to the second occasion had significantly more silent ischemia (p less than 0.007) and longer total ischemic time (p less than 0.01). We suggest that psychological stress may exacerbate myocardial ischemia which is frequently painless.\r"

One hundred fourteen participants who had served for 4.5 years as controls in the RCPP Study, thus receiving no type A behavioral counseling, volunteered to receive such counseling for 1 year. Eleven of the 300 previously type A counseled RCPP participants were lost to follow-up at the end of the additional year. The remaining 289 subjects at risk were found to have maintained their previously reduced intensity of type A behavior. Their previously observed relatively low cardiac recurrence rate during the additional year also did not significantly change. Ten of the 114 previous control RCPP participants were lost to follow-up at the end of the additional year. The remaining 104 subjects who had received a year's type A behavioral counseling showed a significantly reduced intensity of type A behavior and a similar significant decrease in both the cardiac mortality and morbidity rate. These results suggest that the decline in the intensity of type A behavior and also in the cardiac recurrence rate previously observed in post infarction subjects exposed to type A behavioral counseling persists for at least 1 year after cessation of such counseling.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups: Group I (n = 40) had conventional stenoses (80% to 95% luminal diameter narrowing) without angiographically evident collaterals, group II (n = 22) had conventional stenoses with angiographically present collaterals, and group III (n = 21) had total or functional total occlusions (99% to 100% diameter narrowing) with angiographically evident collateral flow. There was no significant difference in age, sex, vessel distribution, clinical class, residual gradient, or residual percent stenosis following successful angioplasty among the three groups. The distal occluded pressure in group I (18 +/- 5 mm Hg) was, however, significantly lower than the distal occluded pressure in either group II (34 +/- 7 mm Hg) or group III (36 +/- 9 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). This could not be explained by differences in aortic pressure, since there was no correlation between the mean aortic blood pressure and the distal occluded pressure and since the distal occluded pressure/aortic pressure ratio in group I (0.23 +/- 0.07) was significantly lower than that of group II (0.41 +/- 0.09) or group III (0.41 +/- 0.11) (p less than 0.001). These findings indicate a close correlation between the presence of angiographically evident collateral flow and the distal coronary artery pressure during an angioplasty balloon inflation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In nine patients (group A) selective coronary injection of echocontrast medium through the central lumen of the angioplasty catheter was performed immediately before balloon inflation. This produced regional myocardial enhancement that defined the area of dyskinesis after balloon inflation. In five patients (group B) who underwent left coronary angioplasty, echocontrast medium was injected through the introducer catheter positioned in the left main coronary artery during balloon inflation. In each case this produced regional myocardial enhancement remote from the area of dyskinesis. There were no complications related to the intracoronary echocontrast injections, which produced no discernible exacerbation of chest pain or left ventricular contractile dysfunction. These data indicate that selective coronary injection of echocontrast medium defines the perfusion territory of the artery injected and also provides a means of identifying the area at risk of dyskinesis after balloon occlusion of the artery.\r"

Morphologic changes of dilated vessels were examined angiographically and histologically. Angiographic evidence of coronary dissection was present in 8 (47%) of the 17 vessels. Histologic examination showed that intimal, medial, and adventitial tears were present in 17 (100%), 11 (65%), and one (6%) of the 17 vessels, respectively. In vessels with angiographic evidence of coronary dissection, the tear extended to more than one fourth of the circumference of the vessel. The tear was histologically demonstrated also in vessels which had no angiographic evidence of coronary dissection. Circumferential extension of the tear was greater in women than in men. There were no significant relationships between severity of the tear and histologic or angiographic characteristics of the target lesions. These results suggest that intimal or medial tears may frequently occur also in clinical cases treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and may be necessary for the success of the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that intracoronary concentrations of thromboxane (Tx)A2 could influence the response to cold pressor test (CPT) in variant angina, great cardiac vein blood flow (by thermodilution) and the concentration of TxB2 (the stable metabolite of TxA2) in the great cardiac vein and aorta were measured under control conditions and during CPT in 14 patients with angina at rest associated with transient ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. In seven patients pretreated with aspirin (intravenous administration of 3.6 mg/kg lysine salt of acetylsalicylic acid, corresponding to 2 mg/kg aspirin), TxB2 baseline concentrations were lower in both the great cardiac vein (47 +/- 19 vs 176 +/- 88 pg/ml; p less than 0.005) and the aorta (45 +/- 16 vs 109 +/- 56 pg/ml, p less than 0.02) than in seven patients who were not taking cyclooxygenase inhibitors. In the two groups, great cardiac vein flow and anterior region coronary resistance were similar under control conditions. During CPT anterior region coronary resistance increased in patients pretreated with aspirin (from 1.97 +/- 0.99 to 2.22 +/- 1.11 mm Hg/ml/min; p less than 0.02) and in patients without aspirin pretreatment (from 1.94 +/- 0.43 to 2.06 +/- 0.34 mm Hg/ml/min; p less than 0.05), and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Therefore the vasoconstrictor response of coronary vessels to CPT in variant angina is not influenced by the intracoronary TxB2 concentrations and is not modified by aspirin pretreatment.\r"

Serial thallium images and blood pool regional wall motion were interpreted by three independent observers. Rest and exercise left ventricular ejection fractions were calculated by two observers and were averaged. Transient thallium defects were associated with normal rest and exercise left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion. Mild persistent thallium defects were associated with normal ejection fraction and regional wall motion at rest, with a deterioration in both with exercise. Severe persistent thallium defects were associated with reduced ejection fraction and regional wall motion at rest, but no further deterioration with exercise. These data support the following postulates: Transient dipyridamole thallium defects are due to mild coronary artery stenoses that cause no detectable functional consequence during levels of exercise achieved in this study. Mild persistent defects are due to more severe stenoses that do cause a functional reduction in wall motion during exercise. Although appearing qualitatively persistent, these defects probably represent very slow thallium redistribution and ischemia rather than scar. Finally, severe persistent defects probably represent myocardial scar.\r"

Eleven children had no history of the disease (control group). The maximal diameter was recognized in systole and the minimal diameter in diastole. The mean distensibility index ([maximal diameter-minimal diameter]/minimal diameter) was 5.7% in the disappearance group, 7.9% in the no aneurysm group, and 11.3% in the control group.

Programmed electrical stimulation studies were performed in 28 men and in 10 women with a mean age of 67 years and a mean ejection fraction of 37 +/- 3%. All patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia while they were off all antiarrhythmic therapy. D-sotalol was given as a 2 mg/kg infusion over 15 minutes and did not significantly change the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals from baseline values in the group as a whole. In the group protected by d-sotalol, the percent change in the QTc interval as well as the percent change in refractoriness was significantly increased as compared to the group not protected. D-sotalol also significantly decreased heart rate. D-sotalol prevented the induction of ventricular tachycardia in 18 of the 38 patients, while significantly slowing the rate of the ventricular tachycardia in the group that could still have tachycardia provoked. Seventeen patients were tested on procainamide and only four were protected, while d-sotalol prevented the induction of ventricular tachycardia in 7 of these 17. Eleven patients were discharged on oral d-sotalol doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg twice daily. One patient died 1 month post discharge due to an acute myocardial infarction, and one patient had a cardiac arrest while on d-sotalol and survived and was switched to amiodarone therapy. The remaining nine patients are alive and well at 14 +/- 3 months. D-sotalol appears to be an effective antiarrhythmic drugs and appears to be well tolerated.\r"

Sotalol brought about a significant increase in the retrograde effective refractory period of the anomalous pathway, whereas changes in the antegrade effective refractory period were more variable. In five of nine patients with electrically induced reciprocating tachycardia sotalol prevented the initiation of sustained reentry. In most cases the suppression of the circus movement was the result of the development of AV nodal block. Thus our data support the use of sotalol for the treatment of tachycardias incorporating anomalous AV conduction pathways.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combining propafenone with procainamide or quinidine for treating ventricular arrhythmias in patients in whom procainamide or quinidine therapy alone failed to suppress arrhythmias. In 30 patients, the addition of propafenone resulted in a significant reduction of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) frequency compared to drug-free baseline (406 PVC/hr vs 33, p less than 0.001) and to procainamide or quinidine monotherapy (211 PVC/hr vs 27, p less than 0.01). Propafenone alone was also more effective than either procainamide or quinidine and resulted in significant suppression of PVC compared to the drug-free state (406 PVC/hr vs 38, p less than 0.001). However, higher propafenone doses were necessary during monotherapy as compared to propafenone therapy combined with procainamide or quinidine (730 mg/day vs 480 mg/day, p less than 0.001). Of the 30 patients, 22 required an increase in propafenone dose during monotherapy as compared to combination therapy. Thus, propafenone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent when used in combination with type IA antiarrhythmic drugs. With these combinations, lower doses of propafenone can be utilized effectively than with propafenone alone.\r"

  ".W": "Permanent occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) is associated with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) during days 3 to 10 post RCA occlusion period in the conscious dog; VT could no longer be induced beyond this post occlusion period. The aims of the present study were to determine if subendocardial (SE) fibers in the infarcted right ventricle (RVI) during both inducible and noninducible phases of VT remain viable, and if so, to characterize their transmembrane potential properties with the microelectrode and to assess their morphologic features. The RCA was occluded in 13 closed-chest anesthetized dogs with intracoronary balloon inflation. In one group (N = 7), the infarcted tissues were isolated during the VT inducible phase and in another group (N = 6) these tissues were isolated during the VT noninducible phase. Resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, maximum upstroke velocity, and action potential duration of the surviving SE Purkinje fibers (PF) and ventricular muscle (VM) in the IZ (first layer) were not significantly different in the two groups. Conduction velocity for both basic and premature stimuli from the base to the apex were similar in the two groups. Rapid stimulation at cycle lengths of 300 to 200 msec failed to induce triggering of automatic activity in the two groups. Electron microscopy of SEPF in the IZ showed a drastic reduction in cytosolic lipid droplet accumulation when compared to 24-hour-old infarct. We conclude that: (1) SEPF and VM network in the infarct zone remain electrically viable during the chronic phase of RVI; (2) transmembrane potential properties of this fiber network remain constant and independent of temporal changes of VT inductibility; and (3) ultrastructural improvement of this fiber network suggests an evolution toward normalcy.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations have suggested that Doppler echocardiography is useful in detecting dysfunction in aortic (AVR) and mitral prostheses (MVR). However, to diagnose abnormalities, the spectrum of normal velocities through these valves must be established. Therefore, we used Doppler echocardiography to study 100 patients with 105 prosthetic valves that had no clinical evidence of valve dysfunction 9 +/- 8 days postoperatively. There were 66 Carpentier-Edwards (C-E), 23 St. Jude (S-J), and 16 Ionescu-Shiley (I-S) valves. In 70 AVR, the peak instantaneous gradient was 26.4 +/- 8.2 Hg, mean systolic gradient was 15.6 +/- 5 mm Hg, and gradients varied inversely with valve size, although differences were significant only when comparing the smallest vs the largest valve sizes (p less than or equal to 0.03). Peak instantaneous gradients greater than 36 mm Hg occurred only in AVR size 23 or smaller. There were no significant differences in gradients among C-E, S-J, and I-S AVR. In 35 MVR, mean gradient was 6.9 +/- 2.3 mm Hg and valve area was 2.7 +/- 0.8 cm2; neither varied significantly with valve size. However, S-J MVR group had smaller mean gradients and larger effective valve area than C-E bioprosthetic MVR (p = 0.01 and p = 0.05, respectively). Regurgitation was more common in AVR (26%) than in MVR (9%), p = 0.04, although all instances were mild and clinically silent. We conclude that normal AVR and MVR of a given size and type have a predictable range of Doppler echocardiographic parameters. Doppler evidence of mild regurgitation is a frequent finding in normal AVR and MVR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recordings of the ECG and central arterial pressure were made starting at 5.75 hours after an intravenous injection of 50 micrograms/kg of the drug. Parameters measured were heart rate (HR); PR interval; mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure; preejection period (PEP); and ejection time (ET). Two indices of systolic function were calculated, the systolic time interval (STI = PEP/ET) and total electromechanical systole (TMS = PEP + ET), which was indexed for HR. There was no significant difference from control animals in either the adult or neonatal groups in the PR interval or blood pressure. In the neonatal dogs, HR and STI were also not significantly different from control. However, in the neonatal dogs, there was a significant decrease in the indexed TMS, 288 +/- 7 vs 270 +/- 11 msec (p less than 0.01). In the adult animals, HR decreased from 116 +/- 35 to 66 +/- 25 bpm (p less than 0.01), STI decreased from 0.559 +/- 0.059 to 0.447 +/- 0.069 (p less than 0.01), and indexed TMS decreased from 333 +/- 10 to 291 +/- 13 msec (p less than 0.001). Two-way analysis of variance demonstrated that digoxin differed significantly in its effects on HR (p = 0.005), STI (p = 0.018), and TMS indexed for HR (p = 0.003) in neonatal compared to adult dogs.

  ".W": "Dobutamine (and dopamine) are potent positive inotropic drugs which are frequently given to treat decompensated congestive heart failure. This study reports on the use of ambulatory dobutamine (and dopamine) infusions in 21 outpatients with advanced congestive heart failure. Each patient was initially hospitalized, and hemodynamic and clinical efficacy to dobutamine (and dopamine) was assessed. These 21 patients were carefully selected from a larger population of approximately 40 patients referred for this therapy. Chronic venous access was established and a drug infusion pump was supplied. Patients and family members were trained in the use of these devices. Eleven patients were treated with intermittent dobutamine infusions for 48 consecutive hours weekly, six patients with continuous (i.e., 24 hours daily) dobutamine infusions, and four patients with continuous, daily dobutamine and dopamine infusions. Significant (p less than 0.001) increases in cardiac index (1.8 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2) occurred during the initial dobutamine titrations. Functional classification (3.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.8 +/- 0.7) also improved significantly (p less than 0.01) during the 1.8 to 24 (mean 7.8) months of outpatient infusion therapy with dobutamine (and dopamine). Complications during outpatient therapy included drug tolerance (two instances), infection (two with bacteremias, eight with exit site infections), drug extravasation (three instances), and pump malfunction (two instances). Twenty patients have died: eleven from heart failure, four suddenly (one of them 9 months after dobutamine was stopped), and five from noncardiac causes. Our data suggest that outpatient dobutamine (and dopamine) infusions may be an effective form of therapy for selected patients with severe congestive failure who are refractory to more conventional treatment or who are awaiting cardiac transplantation.\r"

Defect size was defined by the right-to-left ventricular systolic pressure ratio. Patients with small VSD had a good outcome, with no pulmonary vascular disease. Seventy-five percent of patients with moderate VSDs did not require surgery, and 58% had normal pulmonary artery pressures documented on a second catheterization. Of those patients with large VSDs who underwent serial catheterizations in the first year of life before surgery, 62% had partial closure, and pulmonary vascular resistance rose in 21%. None developed pulmonary vascular disease after surgery. Fewer large-restrictive than nonrestrictive VSDs required surgery in infancy (12% vs 51%; p less than 0.005), and more closed enough to never require surgery (62% vs 27%; p less than 0.005, chi square). Surgery is rarely necessary for patients with small and moderate-sized VSDs in the first year and is usually never necessary because of the expected decrease in size. Few patients with large-restrictive VSDs have an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, many defects decrease in size, and most patients never need surgery. Patients who have a nonrestrictive VSD have an excellent prognosis with appropriate management.\r"

  ".W": "Classification of ventricular arrhythmias into those that are benign, potentially lethal and lethal is based on their associated risk for producing sudden cardiac death. This classification system is useful in defining indications for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias and predicting differential rates of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy and toxicity. Whether the reduction of potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias will prevent sudden cardiac death remains to be determined. The class II antiarrhythmic agents--the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs--have been shown to reduce sudden cardiac death in postmyocardial infarction patients, but the precise mechanism of their effect has not been defined. beta blockers are efficacious in approximately 50% of patients with benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. This response is comparable to that seen with the class IA agent disopyramide or the class IB agents tocainide and mexiletine. beta blockers have favorable side-effect profiles including a low incidence of proarrhythmia and a lack of organ toxicity such as hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis or agranulocytosis, which are concerns with class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs. The proper dosage of the beta blocker is critical in limiting adverse effects. In a study of 23 patients with benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, 11 (48%) of the patients responded to nadolol with a reduction of greater than 75% in arrhythmia frequency, and several patients responded at nadolol dosages as low as 10 mg daily. Thus, it is plausible to consider beta blockers as first-choice antiarrhythmic therapy, even in patients with left ventricular dysfunction when sympathetic tone is not required to maintain cardiac compensation.\r"

Patients received their usual therapeutic doses of quinidine or procainamide throughout the study, which consisted of 3 treatment periods; a 2-week placebo treatment period, a 2-week open-label oral nadolol dose titration period, during which the dosages of nadolol were gradually increased from 40 mg daily to a maximum tolerated dose up to 120 mg daily, and a 4-week randomized, parallel comparison period during which patients were treated with either a class I agent alone or a combination of a class I agent and nadolol. Left ventricular ejection fractions by radionuclide ventriculography and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings were obtained at the end of each treatment period. A positive treatment response was defined as greater than or equal to 75% reduction in ventricular premature complex frequency. During the dose titration phase, combination therapy with nadolol (mean dose 94 mg daily) and class I agents produced a mean decrease in ventricular premature complexes of 79% (p less than 0.01), and a mean decrease in ventricular couplets of 95% (p less than 0.01).

The traditional methods of classification have used electrocardiographic features and atrial rate. Although such classifications are simple, the criteria are arbitrary and electrocardiographically similar arrhythmias may have different mechanisms. A realistic classification must incorporate both electrocardiographic description and mechanism. The classification should be such that it can readily incorporate new knowledge in an additive way without completely restructuring the classification. A classification fulfilling these requirements would begin with electrocardiographic descriptors and end with mechanism, known or unknown. For example, a tachycardia may be characterized as supraventricular, atrial rate 300, 1:1 atrioventricular relation, with atrioventricular nodal reentry mechanism. It could then be qualified by further clinical descriptors such as incessant, paroxysmal or repetitive. With this approach, the initial descriptive category will always be constant and the mechanism known or unknown. As more data are obtained in future years, the \"mechanism\" segment of the descriptor may be added or revised.\r"

However, these agents exert little or no measurable electrophysiologic effect on normal Purkinje and ventricular muscle fibers when administered acutely. They prevent catecholamine-induced increases in Purkinje fiber automaticity and may interfere with catecholamine-dependent slow responses. beta-adrenergic blocking drugs also prevent the decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold induced by catecholamines. In the acutely ischemic ventricle, some beta blockers selectively depress conduction within the ischemic zone. The long-term administration of some beta blockers has, in contrast to their short-term effects, been shown to prolong action potential duration and effective refractory period in the ventricle. Which of these observed electrophysiologic effects, either alone or in combination, contributes to the ventricular antiarrhythmic effects of beta-blocking drugs in man is at present unknown.\r"

  ".W": "beta-adrenergic blocking agents are efficacious in the treatment of patients with a variety of supraventricular tachycardias, based directly on their capacity to counter the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on sinus and atrioventricular nodal tissue. Specifically, beta blockers depress sinus node automaticity and inhibit atrioventricular nodal function by prolonging refractoriness and slowing conduction. Supraventricular arrhythmias that depend on these structures either for perpetuation or for conduction to the ventricles are predictably sensitive to beta blockade. These arrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, sinoatrial reentrant, atrioventricular nodal reentrant (dual pathway) and atrioventricular reciprocating (concealed bypass tract) tachycardias, as well as atrial flutter and fibrillation. beta blockers may also be used, in selected patients, to inhibit catecholamine-facilitated accessory pathway function by prolonging refractoriness. beta blockers offer particular clinical advantages, including an acceptable side-effect profile, titratable effect, varied pharmacology and reasonable concordance between efficacy of parenteral and oral dosage forms. The key element in the most effective use of these drugs appears to be an accurate arrhythmia diagnosis that allows for the most appropriate application of a reliable treatment form.\r"

Increased sympathetic tone shortens the refractoriness of atrial and ventricular tissue; however, conduction in the atrium and ventricle is not considered the limiting factor for maintenance of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or conduction over the accessory pathway in atrial arrhythmias. Intravenous beta-adrenergic blockers given to patients in the resting state have a minimal to moderate effect in depressing atrioventricular nodal conduction, but have little or no effect on accessory pathway refractoriness or conduction in most patients. In patients presenting with atrioventricular reentry, intravenous administration of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs often is not effective to terminate tachycardia. However, long-term oral therapy with these agents may be beneficial, especially in patients in whom enhanced sympathetic tone is responsible for the initiation or maintenance of tachycardia.\r"

Patients received sequential doses of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg of nadolol or placebo at 10 minute intervals. The maximum total dosage of nadolol was 10 mg. Measurements taken during 10 minute monitoring periods after each administration included heart rate, ventricular rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. A positive response was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in heart rate, heart rate less than or equal to 100 beats/min or conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Eleven (79%) of patients given nadolol and 3 (20%) of placebo-treated patients demonstrated a positive response. Of the 11 responders to nadolol, 9 patients responded after the first dose, one after the second dose and one after the third dose. Significant (p less than 0.001) mean reductions in heart rate and ventricular rate were observed with nadolol, but not with placebo. Five (36%) of the patients given nadolol and only 2 (14%) of the patients who received placebo were converted to normal sinus rhythm. Adverse effects were limited to 1 episode of asymptomatic hypotension and 1 episode of wheezing with nadolol and 1 episode of asymptomatic hypotension with placebo. Nadolol is effective in controlling ventricular response in patients with sustained SVT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous and oral drug therapy was administered to patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Efficacy was judged on a short-term basis by programmed electrical stimulation and on a long-term basis by clinical parameters and serial ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during long-term follow-up. In addition, the usefulness of programmed electrical stimulation to predict long-term efficacy was evaluated. Intravenous nadolol prevented induction of SVT in 6 of 8 (75%) patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and oral nadolol prevented induction of SVT in 5 of 6 (83%) responders to intravenous nadolol. No episodes of sustained SVT recurred in these 5 patients during follow-up. Intravenous nadolol also prevented induction of SVT in 2 of 17 (11%) patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Both patients remained non-inducible during treatment with oral nadolol, and neither experienced recurrence of SVT during follow-up. Intravenous atenolol prevented induction of SVT in 5 of 6 (83%) patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Oral atenolol prevented induction of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in 4 of 5 (80%) patients responding to intravenous atenolol, and none of these 4 patients experienced a clinical recurrence. Intravenous atenolol prevented induction of SVT in 1 of 4 (25%) patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Oral atenolol prevented induction of SVT in this patient and the arrhythmia has not recurred during follow-up.

In 18 patients the infarct-related artery remained occluded. Creatine kinase (CK) level peaked and normalized significantly earlier in patients with early reperfusion than in patients with late reperfusion, and in patients with late reperfusion earlier than in patients with permanent occlusion. Thus, the interval of absolute diagnostic sensitivity of CK depends on early infarct perfusion. In contrast, release of myosin light chains was not significantly changed by recanalization of the infarct-related artery compared with that in nonreperfused myocardial infarction. Thus, in patients with acute myocardial infarction, myosin light chains may be superior to CK as a diagnostic means and for estimation of infarct size.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of coronary collateral perfusion on the kinetics of creatine kinase (CK) was examined in 32 patients undergoing intracoronary thrombolysis within 6 hours after the onset of a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Blood sampling for CK was performed every 2 to 4 hours for a period of 72 hours after AMI. The cumulative CK release was determined using the integrated appearance function curve with the individual disappearance rate. In 19 patients in whom thrombolysis was successful (group A), time to peak CK level was 11 +/- 1 (standard error of the mean) hours after AMI and cumulative CK release was 2,599 +/- 424 U/liter. In 6 patients who had a significant collateral circulation to the infarct-related coronary artery and unsuccessful reperfusion (group B), the time to peak CK was 16 +/- 1 hours (p less than 0.05 compared with group A) and cumulative CK release was 1,897 +/- 478 U/liter (difference not significant compared with group A). In the remaining 7 patients, with neither recanalization nor significant collateral perfusion group C, time to peak CK was 21 +/- 1 hours and significantly (p less than 0.05) longer than groups A and B. Cumulative CK release (2,707 +/- 776 U/liter) was not significantly different from groups A and B. Thus, collateral perfusion is an important determinant of the CK time-activity curve during AMI. Early peaking of CK levels does not reliably identify spontaneous or drug-induced recanalization of the infarct-related coronary artery.\r"

During 12-month (mean) follow-up there were 65 cardiac deaths and 21 nonfatal repeat AMIs. Twenty-nine variables (from the history, physical examination, serum chemistries, ambulatory monitor, radionuclide ventriculogram and exercise test) were arranged into in 5 sequential groups according to the time at which results became available during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) and receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to assess improvement in prediction of mortality or repeat AMI by addition of each group of variables. The first group of independent predictors included rales, left bundle branch block and symptom status at 1 month before admission. Addition of information from ambulatory monitoring or serum chemistry did not improve prediction. Radionuclide ejection fraction made a statistically significant, independent contribution to mortality prediction. Of the final group the only exercise test variable that contributed independently to prediction was whether the patients took the test. However, receiver-operator characteristic curves showed that improvement in sensitivity and specificity by addition of information from the radionuclide scan and exercise test was clinically insignificant. Our results imply that costly tests after AMI should be reserved for specific indications and not applied universally for prognosis. Although these tests were highly predictive individually, each test generally added little to preexisting prognostic information.\r"

All patients had ST-segment elevation in 1 or more inferior leads (II, III or aVF). Of the 12 patients with circumflex coronary artery occlusion, 10 (83%) had ST-segment elevation in 1 or more lateral leads (aVL, V5 or V6) without ST-segment depression in lead I. Similar electrocardiographic findings were noted in only 1 of 29 patients (4%) with right coronary occlusion (p less than 0.001). ST-segment depression in precordial leads V1-V3 was equally prevalent in both groups. Thus, the presence of both ST-segment elevation in 2 or more inferior leads and ST-segment elevation in 1 or more lateral leads with an isoelectric or elevated ST segment in lead I identified circumflex coronary occlusion with a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive accuracy of 91% and negative predictive accuracy of 93%. When these criteria were prospectively applied to an additional cohort of 19 consecutive patients with inferior AMI (5 with left circumflex and 14 with right coronary artery occlusion), presence of left circumflex coronary artery occlusion was predicted with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 93%, positive predictive accuracy of 100% and negative predictive accuracy of 93%. Thus, the admission 12-lead electrocardiogram can assist in differentiating left circumflex from right coronary artery occlusion in patients with inferior AMI.\r"

Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic recordings and a simultaneous digital subtraction LV angiogram in the 30 degree right anterior oblique view were performed before coronary occlusion, after 60 seconds of the first 2 occlusions and at 20, 40, 60 and 90 seconds of reperfusion. Diastolic pressure-volume relations paired the digital volumes to corresponding high-fidelity analog pressures. Similar and significant depression of global ejection fraction, percent radial shortening in the jeopardized region, maximal positive dP/dt and significant elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure and ST segments occurred with each 60-second coronary occlusion. All of these variables except LV end-diastolic pressure returned to control levels within 40 seconds of reperfusion. Significant elevation of the diastolic pressure-volume relation occurred with each coronary occlusion and progressively diminished to control values with 60 seconds of reperfusion. No statistically significant difference in any measurement occurred between the 2 occlusions and reperfusions at any point. This study shows that similar and significant depression and time course of recovery of global and regional systolic and global diastolic LV function accompanied each 60-second coronary occlusion with recovery of systolic function preceding recovery of diastolic function.\r"

Nicardipine was administered intravenously as a 2-mg bolus followed by an infusion titrated to maintain a 10- to 20-mm Hg decrease in systolic arterial pressure. At rest, nicardipine decreased systemic and coronary vascular resistances, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased coronary blood flow, heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption. During bicycle exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, nicardipine significantly prolonged exercise duration and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression. These changes were associated with no alteration in the product of systolic pressure and heart rate, decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, systemic and coronary vascular resistances and increased coronary blood flow, as well as myocardial oxygen consumption. During atrial pacing, the heart rate threshold for myocardial ischemia was not changed by nicardipine administration, despite improvement in the ratio of coronary blood flow to myocardial oxygen consumption and hemodynamic changes otherwise similar to those during exercise. Nicardipine favorably influenced myocardial metabolic state, as indexed by lactate extraction during pacing-induced ischemia. Nicardipine is a potent coronary and systemic vasodilating drug that improves exercise tolerance and myocardial metabolic response to pacing stress, the mechanism for which appears to be partially mediated through increased coronary blood flow.\r"

It has been suggested that isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5MN), an active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate, administered twice daily 12 hours apart does not lead to development of tolerance. The duration of effects of IS-5MN at a dose of 20 and 40 mg and of placebo was studied in patients with angina pectoris who responded to nitrates after the first dose (n = 12) and after 1 week of twice-daily therapy (n = 9). The study was double-blind, randomized and crossover in design. Compared with placebo values, after the first dose of 20 and 40 mg IS-5MN, exercise duration was higher at 2 hours (p less than 0.001) and 6 hours (p less than 0.02). After 1 week of twice-daily therapy at these doses, exercise duration increased at 2 hours (p less than 0.05) but not at 6 or 10 hours after the dose. After the first dose of 20 and 40 mg IS-5MN, standing systolic blood pressure decreased at 2 hours (p less than 0.02). Blood pressure did not change significantly after chronic therapy. Tolerance to antianginal effects during twice-daily therapy with 20 and 40 mg of IS-5MN developed despite higher plasma IS-5MN concentrations at 2 and 6 hours during twice-daily therapy than after the first dose. The tolerance during twice-daily therapy with IS-5MN was characterized by a reduced peak effect at 2 hours and shortened duration of action compared with first-dose effects.\r"

During angiography, great cardiac vein blood flow, right atrial and aortic pressures were measured, and coronary angiograms were recorded at baseline and 1 to 4 minutes after each hyperventilation. Samples for dopamine plasma levels were drawn before and throughout the studies. In 3 selected patients, levodopa and carbidopa were associated with 30 mg of domperidone, an antagonist of dopamine peripheral receptors. Levodopa and carbidopa consistently prevented the occurrence of ischemia after hyperventilation in 6 of the 15 patients. This was due to inhibition of local coronary spasm in 2 patients and reduced coronary constriction in 4. Ischemia due to hyperventilation was still prevented despite addition of domperidone with levodopa and carbidopa. Plasma dopamine levels were 23 +/- 15 before and 739 +/- 284 pg/ml 2 hours after administration of levodopa and carbidopa. These findings are consistent with either a decreased central dopaminergic activity and associated disregulation of vasomotor tone, or a peripheral vasodilatory effect of increasing dopamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The frequency and duration of transient ischemic episodes were determined from analysis of 1 or more 24-hour Holter recordings by the compact analog technique. Ninety percent of the episodes in both syndromes were silent; 80% of the episodes of Prinzmetal angina were associated with ST-segment elevation and all episodes of chronic stable angina had ST-segment depression. Ischemic episodes were shorter (3 +/- 2 vs 18 +/- 23 minutes, p less than 0.0005) but more frequent (21 +/- 18 vs 6 +/- 4 per 24 hours, p less than 0.0001) in patients with Prinzmetal angina than in those with chronic stable angina. In patients with chronic stable angina, both silent and painful episodes had a peak occurrence in the morning and early afternoon hours (between 8 AM and 3 PM); the fewest episodes were between 1 AM and 5 AM. This distribution was not random by chi-square test (p less than 0.001). Cosinor analysis of ischemic episodes periodicity showed the acrophase at 1 PM, which was not different from that (3 PM) of the circadian rhythmicity for heart rate. In case of Prinzmetal angina, the acrophase of heart rate changes was at 5 PM, but a clear periodicity in the distribution of the ischemic episodes was not found. These differences in the circadian periodicity may reflect differences in the mechanism of ischemia in chronic stable angina and in Prinzmetal angina and are likely to be of therapeutic significance.\r"

  ".W": "A recent report showed that during Holter monitoring of patients with syndrome X (typical anginal pain, positive exercise test response [at least 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression], no evidence of coronary spasm and angiographically normal coronary arteries), 50% of episodes of ischemic ST-segment depression were painful. This proportion is considerably higher than that in patients with chronic stable angina, which is about 30%. A significantly lower threshold and tolerance to painful stimuli was seen in a group of patients with chronic stable angina in whom 50% of episodes were painful compared with a group in whom only 5% of episodes were silent. Hence, patients with syndrome X may have enhanced sensitivity to painful stimuli. To investigate whether this difference was due to a lower threshold for painful stimuli in general, 12 patients with syndrome X and 10 (age- and sex-matched) with chronic stable angina were studied using the same battery of painful stimuli. Patients with syndrome X had a significantly lower threshold and tolerance for forearm ischemia (-36%, p less than 0.05, and -40%, p less than 0.001) and electrical skin stimulation (-37%, p less than 0.01, and -35%, p less than 0.001); the cold pressor test did not show significant differences (-7%, p = 0.391, and -1%, p = 0.818). Thus, patients with syndrome X in this study had significantly lower threshold and tolerance values for forearm ischemia and for electrical skin stimulation. These differences in sensitivity to pain may partly explain a higher incidence of painful ischemic episodes detected by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during unrestricted daily life.\r"

DET was performed in 10 control subjects (group A) and in 19 patients with syndrome X (group B). Patients in group B had chest pain on effort, a positive exercise stress response (more than 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression), negative ergonovine test response and normal left ventricular function and coronary angiographic findings. During DET no subject in group A showed transient asynergy or ST-segment depression and none had chest pain; in group B, no patient had transient asynergy, 13 (68%) had chest pain and 16 (84%) had more than 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression. Percent fractional shortening was not significantly different in the 2 study groups, either basally (group A, 35 +/- 7; group B, 37 +/- 8) or at peak hyperkinesia during DET (group A, 48 +/- 8; group B, 54 +/- 10). Thus, dipyridamole-induced chest pain and ST-segment depression in patients with syndrome X are not associated with impaired regional or global left ventricular function. This entity of echocardiographically silent myocardial ischemia during DET may be a clue to noninvasive detection of syndrome X.\r"

Metoprolol, when titrated to optimal dose in a controlled trial in 9 patients, reduced both total silent ischemic time (from 156 +/- 65 to 20 +/- 15 minutes, p = 0.04) and frequency of silent ischemic episodes (from 8 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 2 episodes, p = 0.03) compared with placebo. Mean daily heart rate was reduced, from 82 +/- 2 beats/min during placebo to 58 +/- 1 beats/min, as was heart rate at onset of 1 mm of ST-segment depression (106 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 4 beats/min, both p less than 0.001). Heart rate increased 10 +/- 1 beats/min during silent ischemia with placebo therapy, but increased only 4 +/- 1 beats/min during metoprolol treatment (p less than 0.03). During placebo administration the largest proportion of silent ischemic time occurred between 0600 and 1200 hours. Metoprolol attenuated this circadian variation in silent ischemia while reducing (p less than 0.05) total silent ischemic time in all periods. Thus, beta-adrenergic blockade reduces the frequency of silent myocardial ischemic episodes and total silent ischemic time, while mean daily heart rate and heart rate at onset of ischemia and maximal ischemia decrease. Metoprolol treatment also attenuates circadian variation of silent ischemia. These data may be interpreted to suggest that beta-adrenergic activation operates in the pathogenesis of silent myocardial ischemia and its circadian variation.\r"

The output of QMED was compared with ST-segment measurements from a Marquette CASE-II computer (ECGM) using a bipolar lead CM5, defining a positive ECG as at least 1 mm of planar or downsloping ST depression. Results were concordant in 33 patients, 15 with both positive and 18 both negative responses, yielding an accuracy (expressed as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive accuracy) of 83%, 72%, 68% and 86%, respectively. Seven false-positive QMED episodes occurred: 4 due to excess baseline wander or noise in the control ECG, which may have been prevented by reapplication of electrodes, and all 7 episodes were correctly discounted by inspection of the sample ischemic ECG output, yielding an accuracy of 81%, 100%, 100% and 85%. Mean duration and maximal magnitude of ST depression in patients with a positive ECG response was 7.9 +/- 7 minutes and 1.7 +/- 0.6 mm for QMED and 8.9 +/- 7 minutes and 2.2 +/- 0.7 mm for ECGM. The 3 false-negative QMED events were relatively brief and mild ischemic episodes and slight differences in electrode placement between the 2 systems may account for this discrepancy in 2 of the patients. Real-time ST monitoring with QMED is sufficiently reliable for clinical use. Optimal specificity depends on the ability to inspect sample ECG traces to verify a stable baseline and confirm episodes of ischemic ST-segment shift.\r"

Immediately after initial postexercise imaging, patients either drank a commercially available instant breakfast preparation for the intervention test or drank an equivalent volume of water for the control test. Comparable exercise workloads were achieved by exercising patients to the same heart rate for both tests. The order of the 2 (intervention and control) tests were randomized. All patients had at least 1 region of Tl-201 myocardial redistribution on either their eating or control test scans, although only 7 of the 16 had positive treadmill exercise test responses. Forty-six regions showing Tl-201 myocardial redistribution were identified in all 144 regions examined. Significantly more of these regions were identified on control test scans than on eating test scans: 11 of 46 on both test scans, 6 of 46 only on eating test scans and 29 of 46 only on control scans (p less than 0.001). Consistent with results of the quantitative regional analysis, the percentage of Tl-201 clearance over 4 hours in the 46 Tl-201 myocardial redistribution regions was 39 +/- 8% for the eating tests and 29 +/- 8% for control tests (mean +/- standard deviation, p less than 0.003). In 4 patients diagnosis of transient ischemia would have been missed because their 14 Tl-201 myocardial redistribution regions were detected only on the control test scans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The reproducibility and duration of contrast enhancement has also been examined. Forty-five contrast injections were given, 36 into the left and 6 into the right coronary arteries and 3 into bypass grafts of 28 patients undergoing diagnostic arteriography. Myocardial contrast enhancement occurred in 91% of cases. Although contrast enhancement appeared within the expected area of distribution of the artery infused, in no case was enhancement homogeneous. In 4 patients (1 of whom had undergone coronary bypass surgery), contrast enhancement also appeared in areas remote from the expected perfusion territory, in each case due to well established collateral supply seen angiographically. The contrast effect persisted for 71 +/- 26 seconds. Repeat injection in 5 patients (using identical echocardiographic windows) confirmed the reproducibility of the technique. No patient had symptoms related to the injections, although transient left ventricular wall motion abnormalities were observed in 3 cases. High-grade coronary stenoses did not affect distribution of myocardial contrast enhancement, although coronary occlusions produced well defined deficits. Thus, selective intracoronary injections of hand-agitated echocardiographic contrast medium produce regional myocardial enhancement, which probably reflects the perfusion territory of the artery. The technique is safe and reproducible in human subjects. Nevertheless, because regional enhancement after selective coronary injections is not homogeneous, analysis of enhancement deficits is unlikely to provide a clinically useful means of evaluating the functional significance of coronary stenoses.\r"

Similarly, men with ECG LV hypertrophy were at increased risk for 4 of 6 arrhythmia grades (p less than 0.05). However, owing to low prevalence ECG LV hypertrophy was not associated with arrhythmia in women. After adjustment for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, valvular heart disease, angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction, the association of echocardiographic but not ECG LV hypertrophy with ventricular arrhythmia remained significant (p less than 0.001). Thus, echocardiographic LV hypertrophy is more prevalent and more sensitive for ventricular arrhythmias than ECG LV hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the hemodynamic effect of different programmed atrioventricular (AV) delays and the importance of the actual timing of left atrial (LA) depolarization, 16 patients with dual-chamber pacemakers were studied and all were found to have an optimal programmed AV delay for cardiac function. However, randomly chosen AV delays of 150, 200 or 250 ms actually provided worse stroke volume than VVI pacing in 7 patients. The optimal programmed AV delay was variable between patients and was related to the interatrial conduction delay, measured as the time from right atrial pacing artifact to LA depolarization (mean 144 +/- 82 ms, range 70 to 380.) Patients with short interatrial delays (less than or equal to 90 ms) were served better by shorter programmed AV delays (150 ms), and patients with longer interatrial delays (greater than or equal to 120 ms) were served better by longer programmed AV delays (greater than or equal to 200 ms) (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, as pacing mode changed from dual-chamber sequential pacing (DVI) to atrial synchronous ventricular pacing (VDD), the LA to ventricular sequence increased from 6 +/- 81 ms to 137 +/- 50 ms (p less than 0.001). This change in the LA to ventricular sequence with mode change produced a significant decrease in stroke volume (p less than 0.05). Thus, the optimal programmed AV delay in patients with dual-chamber pacemakers is predicted by the relation of LA and ventricular activation. Because interatrial conduction delays vary widely, optimal programming requires knowledge of the LA to ventricular sequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, these studies antedate the availability of amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent that reportedly is effective in patients with AF in whom other drug therapy has failed. To analyze the relation between LA size and the ability to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone therapy, 28 patients, aged 32 to 87 years (mean 61), with an LA dimension greater than 45 mm (range 46 to 78, mean 57) were studied. Thirteen patients (46%) had valvular heart disease, 10 (36%) dilated cardiomyopathy and 5 (18%) miscellaneous disorders. In 25 patients (89%) quinidine therapy had failed. After therapy with amiodarone, sinus rhythm returned in all patients and was maintained. Therapy was judged completely successful in 10 patients (alive and still in sinus rhythm with at least 1 year of follow-up), partially successful in 11 (maintaining sinus rhythm for at least 6 months before a change in status) and failed in 7. Completely successful therapy was accomplished in 9 of 18 patients with an LA dimension between 46 and 60 mm, but in only 1 of 10 patients with an LA dimension greater than 60 mm (p less than 0.05). Thus, patients with LA dimensions between 46 and 60 mm who are significantly compromised by AF can often be maintained in sinus rhythm with amiodarone therapy. However, in patients with larger LA dimensions. AF is likely to return despite aggressive antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, a drug with potentially serious side effects.\r"

Indications are less clear in patients presenting only with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (ART). A knowledge of propensity of this latter group to show a rapid ventricular response in the event of AF and the ability of electrophysiologic testing to reproduce the type and rate of clinical arrhythmias are relevant to this decision. The records of 126 symptomatic patients with manifest WPW syndrome were reviewed and separated into 4 groups according to presentation: group 1--AF; group 2--ART; group 3--palpitations suggesting ART; and group 4--AF and ART. All patients except those in group 3 had electrocardiographically documented clinical arrhythmias, and these arrhythmias were compared with those induced during electrophysiologic testing. The shortest RR interval during induced AF and the cycle length of induced ART correlated well with those occurring clinically (r = 0.72, p less than 0.00001), as did the cycle length of induced ART (r = 0.79, p less than 0.00001). Patients presenting with AF (65%) had a higher incidence of atrial vulnerability (48%) and sustained AF at electrophysiologic testing than those presenting with ART (16% and 5%) or undocumented palpitations (27% and 21%). Forty-one percent of patients with ART and 51% with undocumented palpitations had potentially lethal rates (shortest RR interval less than 250 ms) during induced AF. The ability to reproduce clinical arrhythmias and the frequency of rapid rates during AF induced in patients presenting with only ART or undocumented palpitations supports the recommendation for electrophysiologic testing in symptomatic patients with WPW.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of extrastimulus prematurity and changes in intraventricular conduction time on ventricular tachycardia (VT) inducibility were evaluated in 78 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing electrophysiologic study. In a retrospective portion, the effect of adding ventricular extrastimuli vs shortening the ventricular drive cycle length on extrastimulus prematurity and VT inducibility was evaluated in 59 consecutive patients with inducible ventricular arrhythmias (group I). In a prospective component, changes in intraventricular conduction of the last ventricular extrastimulus and the relation to initiation of VT were evaluated in 19 consecutive patients undergoing programmed electrical stimulation (group II). Single (V2), double (V3) and triple (V4) ventricular extrastimuli were introduced during ventricular drive pacing (V1) at multiple cycle lengths. Although reduction of drive cycle length facilitated arrhythmia induction in 25% of patients, addition of an extrastimulus was a more potent method in group I patients. However, the mechanism of arrhythmia induction is not dependent on attainment of shorter coupling intervals with either method. In group II patients QRS duration and intraventricular conduction time of the extrastimuli increased as the coupling interval was reduced. Significant changes in QRS duration and intraventricular conduction time of the extrastimuli that initiated VT were not observed.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the influence of local tissue refractoriness and delay in intervening tissue on the ability of single ventricular extrastimuli to reset and characterize a resetting response pattern in ventricular tachycardia (VT), single ventricular extrastimuli were delivered during 81 VTs and double ventricular extrastimuli in 45 of the 81 VTs. Resetting of VT was recognized as a less than fully compensatory pause after stimulation and was seen in 43 of 81 VTs (53%) with single ventricular extrastimuli and 35 of 45 (78%) with double ventricular extrastimuli. Double ventricular extrastimuli reset 16 VTs not reset by single ventricular extrastimuli. The return cycle, the interval from the extrastimulus to the first VT beat after extrastimuli, has 1 of 3 distinct response patterns: flat, increasing, and flat plus increasing. In 19 VTs, resetting was seen with both single ventricular extrastimuli and double ventricular extrastimuli; 4 flat responses with single ventricular extrastimuli became flat plus increasing with double ventricular extrastimuli. All other patterns were unchanged. In the 19 VTs reset by both single and double ventricular extrastimuli, the estimate of both the total reset zone (94 +/- 36 vs 56 +/- 32 ms) and the flat portion of the reset zone (52 +/- 42 vs 42 +/- 28 ms) was significantly longer with double ventricular extrastimuli (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In conclusion: (1) when single ventricular extrastimuli failed to reset a VT, double ventricular extrastimuli from the same site may reset the VT.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous variability in the frequency of premature ventricular complexes (VPCs) during ambulatory electrocardiography was examined over short (2- to 14-day) and long (6- to 12-month) periods in 20 patients. The coefficient of variation of the mean daily VPC frequency was significantly lower in the short-term periods than the long-term periods. The 95% confidence limit for spontaneous variation in mean daily arrhythmia frequencies was estimated with a linear regression method comparing two 1-day electrocardiographic recordings. The relative reduction in VPCs reaching the confidence limit calculated from the short-term periods was 69% at the beginning and 73% at the end of the 6- to 12-month follow-up. Corresponding values for repetitive VPCs were 78% and 77%. In comparing 2 recordings separated by the long interval, the reductions required were 98 to 100% for all VPCs, and even a 100% reduction was not significant for repetitive VPCs. The number of VPCs fell spontaneously below the initial confidence limit in 8 of 20 patients in later assessments. Thus, apparently positive individual responses are achieved in long-term treatment studies if stringent efficacy criteria are not followed. The variability between recordings over short periods remains fairly constant when reassessed after a long interval, even if the frequency of arrhythmias changes over the long interval. This permits application of conventional percentage limits in evaluation of therapeutic effects if the natural extent of the arrhythmias is periodically reassessed.\r"

Pacing was performed at a cycle length less than 400 ms in 5 patients, greater than 400 ms in 5 and at both in 6 with 0, 6, 10, 20, 40 and 60 ms of atrial cycle length alternans. A 12-lead electrocardiogram and high right atrial, His bundle and right ventricular apical electrograms were simultaneously recorded after 30 to 60 seconds of pacing. Alternans was produced in 88% of patients. Alternans was 3 times more frequent at short (less than 400 ms) than long paced cycle lengths (greater than 400 ms) (66% vs 22%, p less than 0.0001). Alternans increased with increasing cycle length alternans and occurred with very little (less than or equal to 10 ms) atrioventricular nodal, His-Purkinje and ventricular cycle length alternans when paced cycle length was short. Alternans was more frequent in the precordial than the limb leads (45% vs 17%, p less than 0.001) and was most frequent in V3 and V2 (sensitivity 69% and 65%) and least frequent in leads I and aVL (sensitivity 4% and 10%). More leads per electrocardiogram showed alternans at short compared with long paced cycle lengths and the number of leads per electrocardiogram increased with increasing cycle length alternans. Occurrence of alternans was highly related to QRS amplitude by Spearman rank correlation (p less than 0.0005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Defibrillation was tested alternately with the single-pulse or sequential-pulse technique 10 seconds into an episode of ventricular fibrillation that was induced with alternating current. The sequential-pulse defibrillation technique using truncated exponential pulses was performed with a right ventricular endocardial catheter and a left ventricular epicardial patch electrode. The first pulse was delivered between the right ventricular apical and the superior vena caval electrode on the right ventricular endocardial catheter. The second pulse was delivered between the right ventricular apical electrode and the left ventricular patch electrode 0.2 ms after termination of the first pulse. Single-pulse defibrillation was performed with a standard intracardiac defibrillation system in which a single truncated exponential pulse was delivered across 2 epicardial patch electrodes positioned over the anterolateral right ventricle and the posterolateral left ventricle. During defibrillation threshold determination, voltage and current waveforms were recorded and integrated to determine delivered energy. Average defibrillation threshold leading-edge voltage for the sequential pulse technique was 496 +/- 140 V, compared with 365 +/- 157 V for the single-pulse technique (p less than 0.005).

  ".W": "To assess the effects of posture on anterograde and retrograde atrioventricular conduction, electrophysiologic testing was performed in 25 patients in both the supine and 45 degrees upright positions on a tilt table. Retrograde conduction was present during ventricular pacing in 17 patients in the supine position; all 17 continued to manifest retrograde conduction in the upright position. In all patients with absent retrograde conduction while supine, retrograde conduction could not be demonstrated while upright. Upright posture significantly (p less than 0.05) shortened the sinus cycle length (from 808 +/- 34 to 678 +/- 26 ms, mean +/- standard error of the mean), AH interval during sinus rhythm (78 +/- 6 to 69 +/- 6 ms), and AH interval during atrial pacing at cycle length 500 ms (123 +/- 13 to 91 +/- 9 ms). Total atrioventricular conduction time during atrial pacing shortened significantly (from 169 +/- 13 to 136 +/- 10 ms), as did ventriculoatrial conduction time during ventricular pacing (from 192 +/- 9 to 178 +/- 7 ms). Upright posture also significantly shortened both anterograde block cycle length (390 +/- 20 to 328 +/- 17 ms) and retrograde block cycle length (466 +/- 27 to 354 +/- 18 ms). However, the effect of upright posture on retrograde block cycle length was significantly greater than on anterograde block cycle length: a 21% decrease retrograde vs a 14% decrease anterograde (p less than 0.05). These effects may produce clinically important changes in characteristics of arrhythmias that depend on the properties of anterograde and retrograde conduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results suggested low height-for-age (15th percentile National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and high weight-for-height (60th percentile NCHS). Skinfold thicknesses were lower whereas arm muscle areas were more similar to NCHS reference values. Total body water (as percent body weight) was greater than reference values, consistent with lower body fat. Differences in body proportions did not account adequately for the high weight-for-height. The data suggest that the high weight-for-height in these children is not obesity but is associated with lower body fat and greater lean tissue or lean tissue hydration that may reflect dietary, environmental, or genetic influences. Weight-for-height cutoffs for wasting or obesity may require different interpretations for different populations.\r"

Compliance was monitored on the basis of the urinary excretion of lithium, which was added to the supplements. Average compliance was approximately 80% and this decreased slightly in time. Systolic blood pressure decreased in both groups to a comparable degree; consequently no specific effect of the fish supplement was observed. The fish supplement significantly prolonged bleeding times. Hematology was hardly affected but platelet counts decreased significantly. No indications were obtained for adverse effects of the fish supplement.\r"
