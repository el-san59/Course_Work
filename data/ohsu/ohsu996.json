  ".W": "Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a rare condition and is poorly recognized in the otolaryngological literature. The condition is characterized by the appearance of cutaneous nodules within the head and neck region especially around the external ear. Variable lymphadenopathy and peripheral eosinophilia can occur and the condition can mimic neoplasia. It is important to be aware of this disease entity in order to avoid overtreatment. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice; however, this often multilobulated and poorly delineated lesion often precludes initial wide excision and local recurrence is common. We present three cases of this unusual condition and a brief resume of the literature.\r"

  ".W": "Ethyl esters of fatty acids (EEFA) have been found to be formed during ethanol metabolism. Human adipose tissue contains high concentrations of free fatty acids, the substrate for EEFA synthesis, and might therefore be a tissue with great potential for EEFA formation. In order to explore their potential usefulness as markers of alcohol abuse, the EEFA concentration and the activity of EEFA-synthesizing enzyme were therefore determined in adipose tissue from men belonging to the following categories: teetotalers, social drinkers, alcoholics under treatment, or established alcoholics found to have died as a result of alcohol intoxication. In order to estimate the half-life of EEFA and the synthase activity induction, the alcoholics were examined after different time periods of abstinence from alcohol. Comparisons were also made with several established markers of alcohol abuse. EEFA were not found in teetotalers, and were found in low concentrations in some of the social drinkers. EEFA were found in several alcoholics, and the forensic cases had high concentrations. EEFA-synthesizing enzyme activity was found in all subjects, increasing from teetotalers to social drinkers, and being 2-fold higher in alcoholics and 5-fold higher in dead alcoholics. The induction of the enzyme after abstinence appeared to have a half-life of the order of several weeks. Correlations were found between EEFA synthase activity and previously established markers of alcohol abuse known to remain for a long time period after abstinence, such as mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume. This preliminary study suggests the possibility that EEFA synthase induction in adipose tissue might have a longer half-life than previously used markers of alcohol abuse. It is therefore suggested that the induction of EEFA synthase might be a potentially useful new marker for alcohol abuse because of its apparent proportionality to alcohol intake over a prolonged time period, its presumed specificity, and long-term elevation after alcohol abstinence. This potential marker should be analysed further.\r"

Group B did not start taking cod liver oil until 6 weeks after hospital discharge, and they then took cod liver oil for 6 weeks. Diet, medication or smoking habits were kept as constant as possible during the study. During the period of cod liver oil intake, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 (n-3), EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 (n-3), DHA) increased significantly in phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol esters (CE), whereas linoleic acid (18:2 (n-6), LA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3 (n-6), DHGLA) and arachidonic acid (20:4 (n-6), AA) were significantly decreased in phospholipids. The plasma level of TG was significantly decreased during the cod liver oil intake.

The study population consisted of 70 patients with chronic CHF (NYHA functional groups III and IV) following dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or myocardial infarction (MI), and 35 age-matched healthy subjects. The AV plane displacement was recorded from the apical 4- and 2-chamber views at four LV sites located about 90 degrees apart and representing the septal, anterior, lateral and posterior parts of the LV wall. A mean value was calculated from the above sites (AV-mean). Patients with CHF showed a significant generalized reduction of AV plane displacement compared to healthy subjects (5.6 mm vs. 14.5 mm, P less than 0.001). Thirty CHF patients also underwent radionuclide angiography in order to determine the ejection fraction (EF). The correlation between AV-mean and EF was good (r = 0.82, P less than 0.001). The selection of an AV-mean of less than 7 mm to define a severely depressed LV function (EF less than 30%) gave a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 67%. It is concluded that the AV plane displacement can be used to estimate LV systolic function in patients with CHF.\r"

Myotonia gives an increased relaxation time. The latter was measured in the adductor pollicis. There was a significant decrease in half relaxation time before treatment compared with the values during treatment. In summary, the results indicate that selenium and vitamin E therapy may have an effect on myotonia. The effects of treatment on motor functions were minimal, and overall motor performance was not improved.\r"

The initial plasma NPY-LI did not differ between patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and angina pectoris. Initial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher in patients with AMI than in those with angina pectoris. Plasma levels of noradrenaline remained elevated in AMI patients, but decreased towards normal values in patients with angina pectoris. Levels of NPY-LI returned to normal within 25 h in all patients. Tachycardia and left ventricular failure were related to high NPY-LI and noradrenaline levels. A positive correlation was found between noradrenaline and NPY-LI in plasma. It is suggested that neuropeptide Y (NPY), an endogenous vasoconstrictor peptide, should be considered as one of the mediators involved in the cardiovascular response to sympathetic activation induced by myocardial ischaemia.\r"

From the Swedish Central Register of Causes of Death, 70 patients below the age of 80 years who had died from aortic stenosis during a 1-year period in the County of Stockholm (population 1.5 million), were identified. A retrospective analysis of their medical records showed that 37 individuals were suitable candidates for surgery. The presence of aortic stenosis had been verified at autopsy in 31 (84%) patients. The remaining six patients (16%) had their aortic stenosis diagnosis established by a thorough non-invasive investigation performed before death. Although typical signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis were recorded in all 37 patients, only six (16%) of them had been considered by their physicians to be suitable candidates for surgery prior to death. The deceased patients were compared with a group of 68 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis during the same period. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to symptoms and clinical findings, except for a higher incidence of syncope in the operated group. It is concluded that, of 105 (68 surgically treated and 37 deceased) eligible patients with aortic stenosis, 37 individuals did not receive surgical care in time. The reason for this was probably insufficient knowledge of the curability of the disease.\r"

Each treatment period lasted for 10 weeks. The blood pressure was similar irrespective of treatment. Serum glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test were significantly lower when the patients were treated with felodipine than when they were taking hydrochlorothiazide. Serum insulin levels appeared to decrease at an earlier stage of the test when the patients were treated with felodipine, the calcium antagonist, than with the other two antihypertensive substances, which suggests that glucose tolerance is impaired to a lesser extent during treatment with the calcium antagonist.

Levels of urinary cyclic-adenosinemonophosphate (U-cAMP), but not of plasma cAMP (P-cAMP), were higher (P less than 0.001) in hypertensives than in controls. This was the case regardless of the type of drug treatment and the blood pressure level that was reached. U-cAMP correlated with adrenaline in multivariate analyses. S-Ca levels were higher (P less than 0.001) and S-Mg levels were lower (P less than 0.001) in hypertensives than in controls. This was not explained by thiazide treatment.

The patients with high blood pressure were younger (65 vs. 73 years) and much more often had a history of hypertension (78 vs. 42%). Cardiac and vascular hypertensive manifestations were more frequent, particularly when only those patients with a history of hypertension were compared in the two groups. Alcohol abuse was mentioned in a higher proportion of hypertensives in the summaries of their medical records. No definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to the size and location of the brain lesions. Clinical symptoms did not differ between the groups, neither did the proportion of patients who could be discharged from hospital immediately. Mortality was higher in the high blood pressure group (30 vs. 14%, P less than 0.05). Thus the characteristics of patients with very high blood pressure were: younger age, much more frequent and severe previous hypertension. Alcohol abuse might be an important factor. The type, size and location of the brain lesion itself could not be statistically related to the high blood pressure, but very large lesions, particularly haemorrhages, might be associated with a reactive blood pressure response.\r"

Arterial adrenaline may be a sensitive marker of sympatho-adrenal activity related to pain.\r"

  ".W": "Erythrocyte fluidity and other haemorheological variables were studied in 22 patients with essential hypertension and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Hypertensive patients displayed a significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity (P less than 0.001). Similarly, significantly elevated values for haematocrit, plasma and whole blood viscosity, as well as aggregation tendency were observed compared to controls. Although differing in these respects from controls, there were no obvious relationships between these rheological variables and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity and other changes in haemorheological variables of red blood cells found in hypertensive patients may be explained by an enlarged metabolic pool of free calcium ions in these red blood cells. It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of essential hypertension are multifactorial rather than being based on a single molecular derangement. Primary events resulting in altered physicochemical properties of the red blood cells may work in concert in the development of essential hypertension, in addition to the increased availability of calcium ions and their potential role in smooth muscle contraction.\r"

The median dose of acetazolamide was 500 mg, and the median duration of treatment was 3 months (range 2-71 months). Ten of the eleven patients died, all within 8 weeks after detection of their aplastic anaemia. The relative risk of developing aplastic anaemia when taking acetazolamide was 13.3 (95% confidence limits (CL); 6.8-25.3). The estimated incidence of reported acetazolamide-associated aplastic anaemia is approximately one in 18,000 patient years. The results strongly indicate that acetazolamide treatment is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of developing aplastic anaemia.\r"

  ".W": "Adequate replacement therapy in haemophilia has been available for two decades. This has led to considerable improvements in the life expectancy and physical status of haemophilia patients. A study was conducted to investigate whether this has also led to improvements in quality of life. With this aim, information was obtained from 935 Dutch haemophiliacs by mailed questionnaires on relationships, marriage, family life and employment. Haemophilia patients were less often married than men in the general population (13% fewer) and had a lower total number of children (30% lower, 17% for those who were married). Twenty-two per cent of the patients were not employed and received an income from the disability funds. While severity of haemophilia, joint damage and age increased the risk of disability, it was noted that home treatment was associated with a 50% reduction in this risk. Remarkably, haemophilia patients did not differ from the general population in their view of the quality of their own health. The results of this study show a positive influence of modern haemophilia treatment on quality of life. At present, AIDS overshadows all optimistic feelings one may have about this field. However, the results described here demonstrate the benefits that can be achieved with adequate replacement therapy, and justify the expectation of further improvements in the near future.\r"

The patients (a) collected 7-point diurnal blood glucose profiles at home on three consecutive days and then once weekly for 3 weeks, (b) indicated whether they felt hypoglycaemic at sampling times, and (c) collected extra samples if they felt hypoglycaemic at any time during the study period. The weekly frequencies of symptomatic and biochemical hypoglycaemia were 0.99 and 1.75 per patient, respectively. Biochemical hypoglycaemia was present in 29% of the symptomatic episodes, and symptomatic hypoglycaemia accompanied 16% of the biochemical episodes. Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was experienced at a median blood glucose concentration of 3.4 mmol l-1 (range 1.4-14.9 mmol l-1). Fifty per cent of both symptomatic and biochemical episodes occurred before lunch, while the remainder were evenly distributed throughout the day. The occurrence of biochemical hypoglycaemia, but not of symptomatic hypoglycaemia, was inversely correlated with HbA1c and median blood glucose concentration. Thus symptomatic hypoglycaemia is an unreliable indicator of biochemical hypoglycaemia and of the degree of glycaemic control. Blood glucose measurements are a prerequisite for the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.\r"

In this paper we describe the four patients treated with SK who developed fatal PE. In our opinion this increase in mortality does not warrant the use of SK in routine treatment of DVT of the leg before a proper trial has been conducted to compare the frequencies of pulmonary embolism after both treatments.\r"

The intensity of tracer accumulation was graded in comparison to the liver uptake. The splenic tissue surface was calculated on anterior projection each time. The shapes of the transplants were compared and new uptake foci suggesting spontaneous splenosis were looked for on both scans. The average surface of HSA was 28.2 (+/- 14.7) cm2 on early and 44.1 (+/- 14.3) cm2 on late examination (p less than 0.003) and the increase in intensity of tracer accumulation on both occasions was significant as well (p less than 0.0001). In three patients, some additional splenotic foci were found on follow-up scans. Howell-Jolly bodies in peripheral blood were detected in six of eight patients in early and remained detectable in lower number in three of eight patients on follow-up. No serious infection was noticed in our group of patients. Our work confirmed the excellent survival rates of HSA with improving trapping function and no important spread from original implantation site on long-term follow-up.\r"

Seven healthy subjects were injected with 740 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO on two separate days. On one day, the injection was performed following closure of the eyes and patching for 5 min. On the other day, subjects were exposed to a stroboscopic light to produce photic simulation. Images of distribution of 99mTc-HMPAO were obtained using a Strichman 810X single-photon emission computed tomogram (SPECT) brain scanner. Comparison of images obtained during light occluded versus stimulation conditions revealed a significant increase in distribution of radiopharmaceutical in visual cortex relative to whole brain (peak increase corrected for radiopharmaceutical backdiffusion 36.7% +/- 6.6%). HMPAO appears to provide a useful method for detecting relative rCBF increases with SPECT.\r"

No sex difference existed in lumbar spine BMC. BML as well as BMD were highly dependent on age, body height, and body weight. During the prepubertal years, BML and BMD increased in a fairly rectilinear pattern. During puberty, BMC increased more rapidly: 40% for BMD and 77% for BML. For the entire group, the increase in BMC with age, height, and weight was best predicted by an exponential regression line analysis.\r"

The perfusion defects were located at the left ventricular apex in four (with extension to the inferolateral wall in one), left ventricular anterolateral wall in two, ventricular septum in one, left ventricular inferior wall in one, and right ventricular free wall in one. Some of these defects could be due to myocardial damage at the time of surgery, but these results also raise concern about long-term adequacy of myocardial perfusion following the arterial switch procedure.\r"

The in vitro labeling procedure takes approximately 25 min and does not require centrifugation to separate free from bound 99mTc. Imaging studies were performed in 30 patients using the in vitro labeling procedure and in 30 patients with in vivo labeling. Regions of interest were placed over the center of the left ventricle, inferior and lateral to the left ventricle (background), and over the right midlung. The mean +/- s.e. in vitro RBC labeling efficiency was 98.5 +/- 0.2%. The heart-to-background ratios were significantly higher with in vitro labeling. The heart-to-background ratios, averaged among two blinded reviewers, were 4.6 and 3.4 for the in vitro and in vivo methods, respectively. The heart-to-lung ratio was generally higher with the in vitro procedure (3.6) than that observed with the in vivo method (3.2) but failed to attain statistical significance (p = 0.059).

In the present study, we hypothesized that regional net myocardial uptake of 11C-acetate, which reflects primarily delivery and extraction of tracer, would be markedly flow-dependent and potentially useful as an indirect index of regional myocardial blood flow. In 22 patients with stable coronary artery disease, the regional distribution of early net uptake of 11C-acetate was correlated with estimates of regional myocardial blood flow assessed with oxygen-15-water. The myocardial images of 11C-acetate uptake were of high quality. The correlation between the two approaches was close (r = 0.88) and not affected by the metabolic state of the tissue. Thus, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, under resting conditions, direct estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption in relation to the level of delivery of tracer to the tissue can now be obtained by PET with use of a single radiopharmaceutical, 11C-acetate. This approach may prove particularly useful in streamlining clinical protocols designed to assess myocardial oxygen consumption.\r"

We were unable to demonstrate any difference between the low- and the high-dose of radioactive iodine in scintigraphic ablation of remnant tissue. In 81% (21/26) of the patients, 1073 MBq ablated after the first dose, 77% (21/26 + 3/5 = 24/31) after the first plus second dose, and 69% (24/31 + 0/4 = 24/35) after the first, second, and third dose. Radioiodine (3700 MBq) ablated in 84%, 73%, and 69% of the patients after respectively 1., 1. plus 2., and 1. plus 2. plus 3. dose. Forty percent of the patients ablated with the low dose and 44% ablated with the high dose had elevated thyroglobulin levels at the time of complete scintigraphic ablation. In conclusion, we did not find any difference between 3700 MBq and 1073 MBq iodine-131 as regard to number of doses needed for complete scintigraphic ablation of residual functioning thyroid tissue.\r"

Studies were performed during maximal and minimal tolerated assist device flows. The left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes, cardiac output, and the pump ejection fraction were computer-assessed. All patients had severe left ventricular dilation and hypokinesis before insertion of the assist device, with a mean ejection fraction of 18% +/- 4% which improved to 44% +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) during maximal assist device flows, but fell to 25% +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) during minimal flows. The ventricular volumes became normal at maximal assist device flow but increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during minimal flow. The pump was well visualized and had an ejection fraction of 82% +/- 7%. These data indicate that this assist device effectively unloads the left ventricle. The deterioration in ejection fraction following decrease in assist device flow is in keeping with the dependency of these patients on the device to sustain adequate hemodynamics.\r"

Due to superimposition of the abdominal aorta, the BMC measured for patients with aortic calcification usually is too high. To determine the influence of aortic calcifications, DPA scans were performed in the AP-projection on 100 dissected abdominal aortae with different degrees of atherosclerosis placed on a human lumbar spine cast in lucite. The measured values were compared with those obtained in the same projection without the aortae. The average increase of the BMC values relative to the mean for the vertebrae L2 to L4 for aortae with severe complicated lesions, i.e., those containing larger amounts of calcium, was 0.03 g/cm2, with a maximum deviation of 0.09 g/cm2. Aortae with fatty streaks or fibrous plaques did not cause significant increases of the BMC. The mean deviation for aortae with mild complicated lesions, i.e., those containing smaller amounts of calcium, was within the range of instrument precision.\r"

Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by radiolabeled microspheres. No preferential uptake of glucaric acid was observed in ischemic but viable myocardium. The compound showed high affinity for necrotic myocardial tissue for several days following injury. The preferential uptake in infarcted tissue disappeared by 10 days following injury. This study shows that 99mTc-glucaric acid acts exclusively as a marker of necrosis in canine models of MI. Technetium-99m-glucaric acid may have clinical utility in early cardiac imaging of myocardial infarction and in differentiating recent from old injuries.\r"

Studies with LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated inhibition of 99mTc-glucarate uptake by fructose, confirming this potential relationship. Since anaerobic metabolism can use either glucose or fructose, we hypothesized that 99mTc-glucarate may concentrate in areas of acute ischemic injury. To test this hypothesis, 63 adult rats with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion were injected with 99mTc-glucarate and in vivo and ex vivo images were acquired. Seven animals were also studied with 18FDG and high resolution PET imaging. The radionuclide images were compared to the results of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and conventional histopathology. Thirty-five rats had significant accumulation of 99mTc-glucarate and no TTC staining (indicating infarction) in the involved hemisphere. Of the remaining 28 rats with TTC staining (suggesting viability) of the involved hemisphere, 16 (57%) had 99mTc-glucarate accumulation. In the seven rats that were studied with both 99mTc-glucarate and 18FDG, 99mTc-glucarate accumulated at the center of the occluded MCA territory while 18FDG activity was decreased in this region. These results suggest that 99mTc-glucarate is a sensitive marker of acute severe cerebral injury, but its mechanism of localization is probably different from that of 18FDG.\r"

The other four Mabs had similar tumor distribution at all three time points. The tumor uptake of four Mabs (96.5, P94, CL207. 5.1) differed with respect to in vitro versus in vivo binding to tumor, tumor type, dose of Mab, and tumor site (subcutaneous versus metastases). In contrast, NR-ML-05 demonstrated consistent uptake in tumors independent of the above parameters.

In different groups of animals sestamibi was administered prior to coronary artery occlusion, during occlusion, or 1/2 hour following reperfusion. Sestamibi administered prior to coronary occlusion resulted in an insignificant decrease in 99mTc activity in the ischemic zone. However, infarct zone activity was reduced to 62 +/- 14% of the nonischemic zone. In contrast, administration during coronary occlusion resulted in similar significant reductions of both ischemic and infarct zone activity. Administration of sestamibi during reperfusion resulted in normal ischemic zone activity and markedly reduced activity in the infarct zone. Significantly reduced activity in the infarct zone was found to be independent of the timing of sestamibi administration with respect to the onset of myocardial ischemia and/or reperfusion. Thus, cell viability appears required for uptake and retention of isotope activity.\r"

Studies in vivo that compared 68Ga- or 111In-DTPA-LDL with dilactitol-[125I]-tyramine LDL and 131I-LDL showed that both 68Ga- and 111In-labeled LDL behaved as residualizing radiotracers. Localization of radioactivity within the liver of normal rabbits was visualized clearly with [68Ga]DTPA-LDL by PET and with [111In]DTPA-LDL by gamma scintigraphy. Significant differences were observed in hepatic uptake of normal compared with hypercholesterolemic rabbits in which low-capacity LDL receptor-mediated catabolism was saturated. Gallium-68 and 111In-DTPA-LDL are attractive radiopharmaceuticals for noninvasive delineation of tissue LDL metabolism under normal and pathophysiologic conditions.\r"

We have simulated the projection data from a multidetector SPECT system with point-focusing collimators. The simulated projection data were then reconstructed using the manufacturer's software. The objects simulated included simple geometrical solids such as spheres and cylinders, as well as the distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in a realistic brain slice.

  ".W": "Energy-weighted acquisition (EWA) is an image filtering technique, with a different spatial filter (weighting function) for each energy. The imaging characteristics of EWA are governed by the weighting functions used during the acquisition of the image. The determination of weighting functions is more complicated than the determination of energy windows in conventional imaging because the number of degrees of freedom is much greater. A methodology by which weighting functions can be produced is described. The weighting function is determined by minimizing a generalized chi-square with variable contributions from coefficients quantifying key image characteristics, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution, and scatter fraction. Varying the importance of these characteristics gives us a workable function-generation tool, able to address a variety of clinical needs. The resulting weighting functions exhibit good scatter reduction properties at various scatter depths, as demonstrated by measurements of line source response functions in a scattering medium at depths from 5 to 14 cm. Energy weighting can also be used to compensate for collimator penetration from high energy gamma rays. Weighting functions are tested in the laboratory using both planar and SPECT phantoms.\r"

  ".W": "\"Radiation hormesis\" is the name given to the putative stimulatory effects of low level ionizing radiation (generally in the range of 1-50 cGy of low-LET radiation). Based on historical and pharmacologic principles reminiscent of some of the major tenets of homeopathy, most of these effects are now generally ascribed to protective feedback systems that, upon exposure to low concentrations of toxins, proceed to stimulate metabolic detoxification and repair networks. The activation of these networks may then result in net beneficial effects on the cell, organism or species. Discussions of possible stimulatory effects of low levels of ionizing radiation have recently become entangled with the separate but related question of whether a threshold dose level exists on the radiotoxicologic dose-response curve. This review summarizes some of the relevant historical and scientific data bearing on the question of radiation hormesis. We find the data in support of most of the hormesis postulates intriguing but inconclusive.\r"

The incidence and the type of gross congenital malformations (cleft palate, micrognathia, and micromelia) induced by biotin deficiency were similar among the groups given three different concentrations of vitamin A (4000, 12,000 and 60,000 IU) in the diet. Also, the type of these malformations was different from those (exencephaly, cleft palate and macroglossia) induced by a known teratogenic dose of vitamin A (1,200,000 IU). We conclude that in mice concentrations of vitamin A in the range of 4-10 times the level recommended by the National Research Council and biotin deficiency do not interfere with one another; also, biotin deficiency per se is teratogenic in mice.\r"

  ".U": "91124114\r", 
  ".W": "Although embryonic chick small intestinal segments provide a very limited amount of tissue for preparation of enterocyte brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV), we were able to develop a procedure for isolation of BBMV from cultured 20-d-old embryonic chick jejunum in high yield by modifying a divalent cation precipitation method. Total yield of the brush border marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase in the vesicle fraction as compared to the crude homogenate was approximately 40%, and the specific activity of the enzyme was increased 25-fold on the average. The brush border membrane vesicle fraction was only contaminated with other cellular organelles (basolateral membranes, mitochondria, lysosomes or endoplasmic reticulum) to a minor extent. Functional integrity of the brush border vesicles was indicated by Na+ gradient-driven electrogenic D-glucose transport leading to concentrative transfer (overshoot) of the sugar into an osmotically active intravesicular space. When jejuna were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 10(-6) mol/L insulin, the initial rate of Na(+)-dependent D-glucose uptake by brush border membrane vesicles as well as Na(+)-dependent [3H]phlorizin binding to brush border membranes was approximately twice as high as in vesicles from untreated controls. This strongly suggests that insulin could enhance intestinal absorption of D-glucose by increasing the intrinsic activity of the Na(+)-dependent D-glucose transport system at the luminal membrane of enterocytes.\r"

The variations of the two glycosyl-transferase activities with age could not be explained by the presence of inhibitory factors in microsomes or cytosol, nor were they due to a natural modification of the milk composition at the end of lactation. The increase in fucosyl-transferase activity that followed weaning was prematurely induced by early weaning. Prolonged nursing prevented the normal increase in fucosyl-transferase activity, and late weaning delayed the increase. The sensitivity to the modification of the time of weaning indicated a major effect of dietary changes, related to the introduction of a solid carbohydrate-rich diet, on the developmental pattern of this enzyme. However, a stress response could not be excluded after early weaning since the corticosterone level of the early weaned rats was enhanced as compared to that of suckling rats. For sialyl-transferase, early weaning caused a slightly greater than normal decrease in the activity, whereas prolonged nursing only weakly diminished the normal decrease in the activity. Moreover, late weaning had no effect on the sialyl-transferase activity. The age-related variations of this enzyme likely are due to factors independent of diet. Thus, the developmental variations of the fucosyl- and sialyl-transferases appear to be differently regulated.\r"

The present study examined whether the histamine-lowering effect of ascorbate was accompanied by enhanced chemotaxis in guinea pigs. Animals were fed low ascorbate, adequate or high ascorbate diets (0.5, 2.0 or 50 mg ascorbate.100 g body wt-1.d-1) for 4 wk. Mean liver ascorbate paralleled dietary intake, and these values differed significantly. Blood histamine was significantly depressed in the high ascorbate group compared to the adequate and low ascorbate groups, and liver ascorbate was inversely correlated to blood histamine levels (r = -0.64, P less than 0.001). The random migration of neutrophils was not significantly affected by vitamin dosage. Leukocyte chemotaxis was significantly impaired in low ascorbate animals compared to that of animals with adequate ascorbate nutriture. Leukocyte chemotaxis in high ascorbate animals did not differ significantly from that in the adequate or low ascorbate groups. Furthermore, chemotaxis was significantly lower when cells extracted from animals with adequate ascorbate nutriture were incubated in low ascorbate or high ascorbate serum rather than in autologous serum. These data suggest that the histamine-lowering effect of supplemental ascorbate does not appear to enhance leukocyte chemotaxis and that serum from guinea pigs fed low or high levels of ascorbate appears to contain factors that depress chemotaxis.\r"

In this review we attempt to summarize information concerning Mg absorption and, where possible, to reconcile apparently conflicting observations. Most studies suggest that Mg is absorbed predominantly in the distal intestine. At usual Mg intakes, Mg absorption occurs primarily by intercellular diffusional and solvent drag mechanisms. There is evidence for a saturable component of Mg absorption in the small intestine and the descending colon that is important at low dietary Mg intakes. Pharmacological doses of vitamin D increase Mg absorption in both vitamin D-deficient and vitamin D-replete animals. A substantial amount of Mg absorption, however, occurs independent of vitamin D. In addition, vitamin D may reduce Mg retention through increases in urinary Mg excretion. Intestinal interactions between Mg and calcium or phosphate have been demonstrated in both humans and animals. The nature of these interactions cannot be readily explained by data currently available.\r"

  ".W": "Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to determine whether the mechanism of the previously reported toxicity of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in selenium-deficient rats was related to a diminished capacity for detoxification of reactive oxygen species via glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) as well as by other known pathways of detoxification, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and levels of glutathione (GSH). A 3 x 3 factorial experimental design was used to examine the acute effects of DMH treatment (0, 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight) interacting with dietary Se levels (less than 0.02, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg diet as sodium selenite). Animals were maintained on the test diets for 4 wk prior to challenge with DMH. Preliminary kinetics studies indicated the most appropriate time to examine antioxidant status was 3 h after DMH injection. At that time, livers and colons were analyzed for tissue levels of GSH-Px, CAT, SOD, GST and GSH. Data analysis demonstrated that Se deficiency impaired the ability of both liver and colon to mount an induced detoxification response to the acute oxidative stress generated by DMH challenge and may explain the toxicity of DMH in Se-deficient rats.\r"

The effects of chronic glucagon administration (20 micrograms.day-1.rat-1, for 21 d) were studied on plasma lipid levels, triacylglycerol secretion rates and fractional catabolic rates determined by the intravenous fat tolerance test. Triacylglycerol secretion rates of plasma, chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were measured by using the Triton WR 1339 method. In both fasting and postprandial states, the different rates were not significantly modified by glucagon treatment. However, in the treated animals, significantly decreased triacylglycerol concentrations were observed in plasma and VLDL during fasting (-41 and -46%, respectively) and also in chylomicrons in the postprandial state (-37%) relative to control animals. These data could be accounted for by an increased removal rate of triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein. The estimated values of fractional rate constants (Triton WR 1339 experiment) were increased for VLDL (+62%) in the fasting state and for chylomicrons (+104%) in the postprandial state. Similarly, the fractional catabolic rate determined with the intravenous fat tolerance test (Intralipid, Kabivitrum, Sweden) was increased 49% by glucagon treatment, suggesting an effect of glucagon on the catabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. Glucagon treatment did not modify the composition of VLDL obtained 60 min after Triton WR 1339 injection, except that in the fasting state apo B100 proportions and concentrations increased, suggesting a specific effect on the hepatic secretion of apo B100 VLDL.\r"

Administering MCT is of importance in enteral nutrition of patients with disturbances of fat digestion or lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Their use in parenteral nutrition is also of interest. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of conversion of MCT and LCT to CO2 after parenteral or oral administration in humans. At 1-wk intervals, a liquid formula diet (418 kJ/h for 8 h) was given to five healthy volunteers following an overnight fast. Two hours after starting this, they were given either 100 mg [13C]trioctanoate or [13C]trioleate orally or parenterally. Excess 13C in breath carbon dioxide was analyzed by mass-spectrometry, and oxidation rates over 7.5 h were calculated. Oxidation rates for [13C]trioctanoate were on the average 34.7% after enteral and 31.0% after parenteral administration, and for [13C]trioleate, 25.3 and 24.9%, respectively (p less than 0.05, trioctanoate vs. trioleate). The results show that the oxidation of trioctanoate in healthy humans is greater both after oral and parenteral administration and increases more rapidly than that of [13C]trioleate.\r"

Nonpregnant, nonlactating rats paired for age served as controls. Dry matter, protein, DNA and RNA levels of the mammary gland, liver and muscles of the right hindlimb were determined. Wet weight and total organ or tissue protein, DNA and RNA were higher in mammary glands of L12 and L20 than in age-matched controls. These values were lower in groups W1 and W7 than in the lactating groups. No changes were noted in the total liver protein or DNA content, but total liver RNA was greater in groups L12 and L20 than in controls or group W1. Total muscle dry matter, DNA and RNA were significantly lower in groups L12 and L20 than in groups W1 and W7. Muscle protein content increased progressively from the 12th to 20th d of lactation to a peak in group W1, and it decreased to values found in age-matched controls in group W7. Although the muscle protein mass of the hindlimb during peak lactation (group L12) was only 63% of that in nonlactating control rats, within 1 d of weaning it was significantly higher than in nonlactating rats. Similar changes in RNA suggest that these changes in protein content are related to an adaptative mechanism designed to handle the surplus of plasma amino acids not used by the mammary gland after weaning.\r"

Control rats received a similar diet containing sucrose in place of resistant starch. Fecal collections were performed throughout the feeding period. After 14 d the animals were killed. The small intestine and cecum were removed for morphological examination, measurement of small intestinal crypt cell production rate (CCPR) and analysis of luminal carbohydrate content. Blood samples were collected for analysis of cholesterol, glucagon, and enteroglucagon. In the starch-fed rats, fecal bulk and excretion of starch were higher than in the controls, but they declined markedly over the feeding period. Cecal size and contents were also greater in the starch-fed rats, and cecal pH was significantly lower. The CCPR was 66% higher in the ileum of the starch-fed rats (P less than 0.001), but there was no difference in the jejunum. There were no differences in serum cholesterol or enteroglucagon levels. We conclude that retrograded amylose is partially degraded in the alimentary tract of rats, but it contributes significantly to fecal bulk.\r"

The former enzyme was lower (P less than 0.01) in the vitamin E-, selenium- and beta-carotene-supplemented groups than in the unsupplemented control group, and the latter enzyme was lower in the vitamin E- and selenium-supplemented groups, suggesting a relatively equal effectiveness of these three antioxidants against liver damage. Erythrocytes were tested for protection against uninduced oxidative damage or that induced by 1 mmol/L bromotrichloromethane (BrCl3C) by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), hemoglobin, hemolysis, protein precipitation, alanine release and several enzyme activities. In untreated erythrocytes, selenium, beta-carotene and coenzyme Q10 exhibited protection by lowering (P less than 0.05) TBARS and alanine release, but only vitamin E protected against hemolysis. In BrCl3C-treated erythrocytes, vitamin E, selenium and beta-carotene protected by decreasing (P less than 0.05) protein precipitation, whereas selenium and beta-carotene decreased alanine release. The results of this study suggested that, in a manner analogous to vitamin E and selenium, beta-carotene and coenzyme Q10 function as antioxygenic nutrients.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated kidney cells accumulated L[1-14C]ascorbic acid in a time-dependent manner and reached a steady state after 15 min at 37 degrees C. Initial velocity for uptake was over 300 pmol/mg protein per min when cells were separated from the bathing solution using a density gradient established during centrifugation. The uptake process was saturable with an apparent concentration at half maximal uptake of 36 mumols/L. Ascorbate uptake was reduced by metabolic inhibitors and was temperature dependent. Although ascorbic acid is an acid anion at pH 7.4, uptake did not appear to be inhibited by other acid anions such as p-aminohippurate and probenecid; however, involvement of the ion gradient established by Na+, H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase could not be confirmed. Replacing the sodium ion with other monovalent ions reduced the accumulation of ascorbate significantly. Isoascorbic and dehydroascorbic acids inhibited ascorbate uptake (34 and 13 mmol/L, respectively), whereas high concentrations of glucose showed some stimulation. These findings indicated that ascorbic acid is reabsorbed by the kidney in a sodium-dependent active transport process that is not common to other acid anions and has some specificity for the ascorbic acid structure.\r"

  ".W": "I(indigenous)-compounds are age-related, carcinogen adduct-like, putative indigenous DNA modifications detectable by 32P-postlabeling assay in untreated animals. To investigate the origins of these DNA derivatives, we examined the effects of dietary vitamin E, a natural antioxidant, on I-compounds of rat liver and kidney DNA. Weanling female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed Draper's diets containing 0, 100, 1000, or 10,000 mg/kg alpha-tocopheryl acetate for 6 mo. The DNA from four individual rats of each group was analyzed by a nuclease P1-enhanced version of the 32P-postlabeling assay for DNA adducts. The amount of vitamin E in the liver was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Rats fed vitamin E-deficient diet (0 mg/kg) showed identical profiles and similar levels of I-compounds as those fed the 100 mg/kg diet. Most I-spots were significantly intensified and one tissue-specific extra spot was found in both liver and kidney DNA of rats fed the 1000 or 10,000 mg/kg vitamin E diet. However, one of the five major I-spots detected in the kidney was weaker in the 1000 and 10,000 mg/kg groups than in the 0 and 100 mg/kg groups. These results show that formation of most I-compounds was not affected by vitamin E-deficient diet, and that long-term feeding of diet containing high levels of vitamin E may cause metabolic alterations leading to an increased formation of DNA-reactive (potentially mutagenic or carcinogenic) electrophiles.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate absorption kinetics of riboflavin under in vivo conditions, with blood and lymph circulation intact, the small intestine of anesthetized rats was perfused with [14C]riboflavin in a concentration range between 0.31 and 10.00 mumol/L. Apart from the uptake of riboflavin from the perfusate, passage of the vitamin into the portal (vena portae) and peripheral (vena femoralis) blood was determined. The absorption proved to be a dual process: at low substrate concentrations (less than 2 mumol/L) a saturable component predominated; at higher concentrations simple diffusion was found to be the prevailing uptake mechanism. The apparent transport constant of the saturable component was calculated to be 0.38 mumol/L. [14C]flavin concentrations in the portal and peripheral blood were estimated as a function of the riboflavin concentration of the perfusion media. The dual character of the absorption was reflected by the portal blood flavin levels. Due to the high retaining and equalizing capacity of the liver, the [14C]flavin level of the peripheral blood was relatively low and obeyed saturation kinetics. Constants of elimination, determined by pharmacokinetic calculations, were different for the two blood compartments but independent of the concentration of riboflavin in the perfusion media.\r"

In experiment 1, throughout mating, pregnancy and lactation, female rats consumed one of three diets: basal (less than 0.05 microgram Se/g); selenite (0.15 microgram Se/g) and selenomethionine (0.15 microgram Se/g). Some pups born to dams in the basal group were also given intraperitoneal doses of saline, selenite or selenomethionine. GSHPx activity was measured in tissues from fetuses, 7-d-old and 14-d-old nursing pups and the dams. In all tissues studied, GSHPx activity was highest in the 14-d-old pups whose mothers were in the selenomethionine group. Rat pups given intraperitoneal selenite (3 micrograms/kg body weight) had higher liver and kidney GSHPx activity than pups given the same amount of selenium as intraperitoneal selenomethionine. In experiment 2, all dams were fed the same basal diet, and pups were weaned to diets containing one of two levels of selenium (0.1 or 0.2 microgram/g), one of three forms of selenium (selenite, selenomethionine or selenocystine) or no added selenium. After 14 d of repletion, the highest level of hepatic GSHPx activity occurred in the selenite group and the lowest in the basal diet group. After 21 d of repletion, renal GSHPx activity was lowest in the basal group followed by the selenocystine group. The highest tissue selenium concentration was found in kidney tissues of the selenocystine group. These data support the hypothesis that these dietary forms of selenium are differentially available for GSHPx activity.\r"

Cadmium given in combination with ethanol led to a pronounced increase in cadmium absorption and accumulation in all the tissues studied relative to both non-exposed controls and rats treated with cadmium alone. Both cadmium and ethanol exhibited specific effects on copper and zinc levels of the tissues. These effects often were significantly altered when the animals were co-exposed to cadmium and ethanol. The results suggested that although both cadmium and ethanol individually pose a hazard to essential trace metal homeostasis of various organs, co-exposure can pose a major threat since animals exposed to ethanol absorb much more cadmium than their unexposed counterparts.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing 6, 200 or 500 mg Fe/kg diet (Fe-0, Fe-200 and Fe-500 rats, respectively) for 3 wk. Iron absorption was measured in fasted rats using 59FeCl3 in a 10-min in situ duodenal ligated-segment procedure. After draining the segment contents, the mucus layer was separated from the under-lying mucosal surface using Quarterman's agar cast technique. In comparison with that in Fe-200 rats, iron absorption in Fe-0 rats was markedly increased, but the 59Fe and the total mucus in the mucus layer were decreased. The 59Fe absorption and total mucus and total iron in the mucus layer were similar in Fe-500 rats and Fe-200 rats, but the 59Fe in the mucus layer was marginally lower in Fe-500 rats. There was no evidence that mucus enhanced iron absorption; it appeared to trap or bind iron proportionally to the amount of secreted mucus, suggesting protection against excess absorption. Mucus secretion and possibly synthesis were decreased in the Fe-0 rats.\r"

Cats with short-term infections exhibited a decrease in the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood and a corresponding depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio. Cats with long-term infections exhibited a similar but more profound perturbation of the CD4+ lymphocyte subset that also included a decrease in the absolute number of CD4+ cells. The decreased responsiveness to Con A and PWM in cats infected long term paralleled the decline in CD4+ cell counts, and the duration of infection was directly correlated with the decrease in the percentage of CD4+ cells. These data provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that FIV is the cause of an immune dysfunction in cats, with distinct similarities to that produced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in people.\r"

We found elevations of alkaline phosphatase in excess of 1,000 IU/L in 17% of consecutive patients with AIDS. This level of elevation was less frequent in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma but there was otherwise no significant association with diagnoses or medications, or transmission categories for AIDS. The majority of the patients with elevations to this level did not have documented opportunistic infections or biliary tract dilatation previously described in the \"cholangitis\" syndrome in AIDS patients. Other explanations for these elevations for this common laboratory finding may exist.\r"

  ".W": "Zidovudine use data were examined in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study to determine (i) if the proportion of pre-AIDS participants (i.e., CD4+ cells less than 200/mm3 or AIDS-related complex) taking zidovudine is high enough to explain a slower than expected rise in AIDS incidence in U.S. homosexual men since mid-1987; (ii) which factors are associated with starting zidovudine and clinical trials of zidovudine; and (iii) if pre-AIDS patients, as a group, are being undertreated. Data on zidovudine use, clinical trial participation, and sociodemographic, clinical, and hematologic variables were collected every 6 months from 1,195 AIDS-free HIV-1-seropositive homosexual men from April 1987 to September 1989. Overall prevalence of zidovudine use rose from 3.6% in mid-1987 (visit 7) to 23% in mid-1989 (visit 11). Of those with less than 200 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3, the prevalence of zidovudine use rose from 23% (24% if those taking zidovudine or placebo as part of a clinical trial are included) at visit 7 to 58% (69%) at visit 11. Of those with ARC, 20% (23%) were using zidovudine at visit 7 and 55% (65%) at visit 11. Although numbers were small, the advanced ARC participants (CD4+ cells less than 200/mm3 and two or more symptoms) reported the highest treatment rates (50, 78, 80, 60, and 74% at visits 7-11, respectively). By September 1989, 42% (31%) of those with CD4+ lymphocyte levels less than 200/mm3 were still not receiving zidovudine, suggesting that many high-risk, pre-AIDS individuals are being undertreated. To explore this finding further, we examined a range of sociodemographic, hematologic, and clinical variables to determine which factors best predicted initiation of zidovudine therapy outside of clinical trials. In multivariate analyses, CD4+ lymphocyte number was the most consistent predictor of initiation of therapy over all four study visits. For each 100 cells/mm3 deficit, the odds ratios were 2.3 (95% C.I. of 1.7-3.1) at visit 7 and 1.7% (95% C.I. of 1.4-2.0) at visit 11. Symptom status and education level were also associated with starting zidovudine, but not at all visits. The relatively low predictive power of the clinical variables raises and the possibility that nonclinical factors not measured in the MACS (drug cost, third-party insurance restrictions, and individual preferences) may play an important role in predicting zidovudine use. Finally, comparisons were made between seropositive participants starting clinical trials of zidovudine and the rest of the study population. No important differences were found in demographic or major clinical variables between clinical trial participants and zidovudine nonusers in this study.\r"

Five panels consisting of 105 HIV-1-seronegative specimens from regularly repeating blood donors with no risk factors for HIV infection and 99 HIV-1-seropositive and culture-positive specimens from a cohort of homosexual/bisexual men were sent under code to each laboratory. Amplification procedures and testing algorithms by which specimens were judged positive, negative, or indeterminate varied between laboratories. The average sensitivity for the five laboratories was 99.0%, with two laboratories achieving 100%. The average specificity was 94.7%, varying between 90.5 and 100%. The overall false-positive rate was 1.8%, the false-negative rate was 0.8%, and the indeterminate rate was 1.9%. Of 1,005 determinations made by the five laboratories, 32 (3.2%) were misclassifications. Most of the classification errors occurred in specimens from uninfected individuals and were distributed among the laboratories in such a way as to indicate laboratory error rather than the inherent reactivity of some samples. This emphasizes the need for standardization of PCR testing and caution in interpreting positive PCR reactions in HIV-1-seronegative persons.\r"

DNA extracted from tumor biopsies/peripheral blood lymphocytes of nine patients was shown by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to contain HTLV-I proviral DNA. Blot hybridization of DNA extracted from seven patients with an HTLV-I cDNA probe revealed a monoclonal pattern of proviral integration consistent with a diagnosis of ATL. Eight of the 10 patients were women. Six patients were from Haiti, three from Jamaica, and one from the Bahamas. All patients had very aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two patients presented with sinus and retro-orbital involvement; another had gastric lymphoma that perforated. Nine patients developed hypercalcemia. Eight patients died within 1 year of diagnosis. Two were lost to follow-up. During the course of this study, 66 new cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were diagnosed at this hospital. Ten of these cases were ATL. The prevalence of HTLV-I-related lymphoma in this sample was 15%. Since tissue from all patients was not available for HTLV-I screening, however, it is possible that other cases of ATL went undetected. We conclude from this initial survey that a retroviral etiology should be considered in patients from populations known to be at risk for HTLV-I infection who present with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

Forty percent of the 605 workers sampled had been part of this program, which included behavioral counseling and provision of condoms, for 1 year. The remaining 60% were new recruits. Program participation was associated with both enhanced condom use (p less than 0.001) and behavioral modification (p less than 0.001). Females, and specifically barmaids, were more likely to be condom users but were less likely to have changed their behavior in other respects. Seropositivity to both HIV and Treponema pallidum tended to be higher among females, especially the barmaids. Since barmaids and waitresses in public houses in Dar es Salaam often engage in prostitution, it is felt that to effect a reduction of numbers of their sexual partners, there is a need to address the social and economic factors underlying high-risk sexual behavior.\r"

Overall, 429 (25%) of 1712 pregnant women and 19,903 (55%) of 36,057 nonpregnant women 18 to 45 years of age reported using alcohol in the previous month. Pregnant women who used any alcohol reported consuming a median of four drinks per month, whereas nonpregnant women who used any alcohol reported nine. The prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women declined steadily, from 32% in 1985 to 20% in 1988, but the median number of drinks per month for pregnant women who drank did not change. No decline was observed among the less educated or those under the age of 25 years. In 1988, the prevalence of alcohol use among pregnant women remained highest among smokers (37%) and the unmarried (28%). Although the overall consumption of alcohol by pregnant women in the United States appears to be declining, special efforts are needed to reduce alcohol use among pregnant women who are smokers, unmarried, less educated, or younger, women who may already be at high risk of a poor pregnancy outcome.\r"

Seven neuropathologically confirmed cases of CJD have occurred in this population to date: six patients with clinical CJD presented with ataxia and imbalance, rather than with altered mentation, which is the most common initial manifestation in sporadic CJD, and one patient died in the preclinical incubation state of the disease. All seven cases occurred among the nearly 700 HGH recipients who started therapy before 1970. Since only 10% of the cohort has been followed up for the 15-year average incubation interval from midpoint of HGH treatment to onset of symptoms, the great majority of potentially exposed patients have not yet attained the requisite incubation period for expression of CJD. The median duration of HGH therapy of 100 months in the CJD cases was significantly longer than 41 months for all patients starting treatment before 1970; thus, the duration of pituitary HGH therapy is a major risk factor for CJD.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six medical intensive care units in a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-two autopsied patients of the 401 veterans who received mechanical ventilation and died in the hospital. RESULTS: The class I error rate was 12%. Abdominal pathologic conditions--abscesses, bowel perforations, or infarction--were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors. While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of abdominal pain, results of examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients, and the symptom was not pursued. Six percent of patients had extensive malignant neoplasms (class IIB errors). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical presentation of potentially treatable abdominal pathologic conditions is a common cause of class I errors in veterans who receive mechanical ventilation. Conversely, several patients with unrecognized terminal conditions underwent intensive intervention. If the information gained at autopsy had been known before death, management would have probably changed substantively in 18% of patients.\r"

The patients were assigned randomly to receive continuous subcutaneous infusion of either octreotide, 300 micrograms/24 h (five patients) or placebo (six patients) for 12 weeks. At baseline, mean glomerular filtration rate and mean total kidney volume were not significantly different in the two groups. However, after 12 weeks of treatment, the mean glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the octreotide group (136 mL/min per 1.73 m2; range, 91 to 158 mL/min per 1.73 m2) than in the placebo group (157 mL/min per 1.73 m2; range, 138 to 184 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Furthermore, the mean total kidney volume was significantly lower after treatment in the octreotide group (379 mL/1.73 m2; range, 307 to 454 mL/1.73 m2) than in the placebo group (389 mL/1.73 m2; range, 347 to 465 mL/1.73 m2). Glycemic control did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that subcutaneous infusion of octreotide for 12 weeks reduces increased glomerular filtration rate and kidney size in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus despite the fact that glycemic control remains unchanged.\r"

While industry sponsored 34 marketed and 24 experimental orphan drugs in the 17 years prior to the Act, it has sponsored 39 of 42 marketed orphan products in the 7 years since the Act. An additional 301 experimental products have orphan designation. While 25 of 40 marketed orphan products reportedly had annual sales of less than $1 million, product sales for three conditions are more than $100 million annually. This prompted changes in the law, passed by Congress in 1990, but vetoed. Overall, the law has been associated with an increase in orphan product development. The law's costs and benefits to companies, patients, and the public should be examined if future changes are proposed.\r"

Nearly three fourths of deans and associated deans reported the need for \"fundamental changes\" or \"thorough reform.\" At least 79% of educators voiced support for six specific reforms, such as rewarding teaching excellence and increasing clinical education in ambulatory and community settings. While slight majorities supported reducing class size and centralizing governance, substantial proportions stated that they would \"work against\" such reforms. Most educators reported that a broad base of support within the school would be essential for change. The survey suggests a restlessness among the leaders of medical education.\r"

The history of Hodgkin's disease is one of hypothesis generation, which allowed for its effective treatment even without an understanding of its etiology, illustrating the approximate nature of scientific discovery and the importance of chance in historical attribution. Hodgkin, as a scientist, healer, and socially committed individual, embodied the many characteristics that are desirable for today's physician, while the evolution of knowledge about Hodgkin's disease and its treatment is an instructive model for future medical advances.\r"

  ".W": "Primary pulmonary hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary hypertension in the absence of sufficient underlying cardiac, parenchymal pulmonary, or systemic disease to account for it. The population of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous one, both clinically and histologically. As the etiologic mechanisms are unknown, therapy is directed toward the consequences of the pulmonary vascular process. Oxygen supplementation, the use of digoxin and diuretics for symptomatic heart failure, and anticoagulation all may have a role in treating primary pulmonary hypertension, although vasodilator therapy has been the main area of investigation. Screening for vasodilator responsiveness, defining a favorable vasodilator effect, predicting long-term effectiveness, and deciding who to treat have all been controversial. New approaches, such as use of high-dose calcium channel-blocking agents and continuous intravenous infusion of prostacyclin (an investigational agent), have recently been proposed. When medical therapies are exhausted, heart-lung or lung transplantation has increasingly become an option for selected patients.\r"

Investigation identified six additional patients who had received intravenous fluid contaminated by P pickettii but did not become ill. All nine patients had had surgery, and each of these patients but only nine of 19 operated-on control patients had received intravenous fentanyl citrate in the operating room; the mean dose given to the nine case patients was far greater than that given to control patients. Fentanyl in 20 (40%) of 50 predrawn 30-mL syringes was shown to be contaminated by P pickettii. Contamination was caused by theft of fentanyl from predrawn synringes and replacement by distilled water contaminated by P pickettii. Narcotic theft by health care personnel may cause patients to suffer pain needlessly and can also result in dire unanticipated consequences, such as nosocomial bacteremia. Whereas drug testing in the workplace is highly controversial, we believe that testing of health care personnel is indicated when drug abuse or theft is suspected.\r"

Seventy-nine children with invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease 18 to 59 months of age were identified, and 212 controls were selected by random-digit telephone dialing methods. Cases and controls were stratified by age and month of disease onset of the case. Seventeen PRP vaccine failures and two PRP-D vaccine failures occurred more than 2 weeks after vaccination. The PRP vaccine was shown not to be effective (point estimate--47%; 95% confidence interval,--307% to 47%), but the PRP-D vaccine was 88% protective (95% confidence interval, 42% to 97%). Adjustment of the efficacy estimates for potential confounding variables did not change the results significantly.

Major depressive disorder, but not depressive symptoms, was a risk factor for mortality over 1 year independent of selected physical health measures and increased the likelihood of death by 59%.

Hypercholesterolemic subjects were studied under metabolic ward conditions for diet periods of 3 weeks while receiving lovastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo. Multiple lipoprotein levels were measured during the final week of each diet period. Nineteen subjects completed the study on the high-fat (43% of kilojoules) diet and 16 on the low-fat (25% of kilojoules) diet. Lovastatin reduced total cholesterol by 23% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 30%, compared with placebo on both diets, with no significant diet-drug interaction. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was raised by 7% to 8% on the diet regimens. Addition of lovastatin to the low-fat diet permitted 80% of subjects on this diet, but less than 50% of those on the high-fat diet, to achieve current guidelines. Although lovastatin produces a comparable percentage reduction in lipoprotein profiles on either diet, the accompanying low-fat diet remains advisable for additional reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to specified goals.\r"

The age of the patients ranged between 7 and 84 years. Fifteen patients were females and 24 males. The tumors were located at the parotid gland (n = 30), the submaxillary gland (n = 1), the soft palate (n = 5) and the oral mucosa NOS (n = 3). At presentation 4 tumors were intraglandular and 35 extraglandular; three patients had lymph node metastases and one patient lung metastases. The grade of differentiation was assessed using the criteria of Healey et al. Twelve tumors were classified as grade I, 17 as grade II, and 10 as grade III. Follow-up information was obtained with a duration of 5-144 months (mean 44.7 months). Six cases recurred locally and 5 developed metastases. Five years cumulative survival was 100% for grade I, 70.1% for grade II, and 47.2% for grade III. The results point to the usefulness of the assessment of the grade of differentiation as a guide to anticipate the outcome of the disease.\r"

There was no difference in the clinicopathological characteristics of those with concurrent head and neck and gastric cancers, except for the higher incidence of metachronous occurrence in the former. These findings suggest that, in cases of esophageal cancer associated with concurrent head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, intraesophageal multiplicity of the esophageal carcinoma is frequent and that preoperative serial evaluations is most important to design treatment and estimate the prognosis.\r"

Eleven patients with cholelithiasis were used as controls. Comparison of lymphocyte subpopulations between colorectal cancer and control groups revealed a significantly increased rate of Leu-12+ cells in the cancer patients. Furthermore, a significant increase of Leu-3a+ Leu-8- cells and a significant decrease of Leu-3a+ Leu-8+ cells were also found in the paracolic nodes of the cancer patients. However, Leu-2a+ Leu-15- cells were not different between the both groups. Meanwhile, in the cancer patients, the rates of Leu-4+, Leu-3a+, and Leu-3a+ Leu-8- cells were higher in the paracolic nodes compared with the intermediate nodes. Additional investigation of the correlation between clinicopathological features of the tumors and lymphocyte subpopulations, showed that Leu-12+ cells were related to the tumor size and Leu-2a+ 15- cells related to the histopathological type. The foregoing results indicate that the rates of both B and helper T cells, which may specifically participate in the antibody production, increase in the regional lymph nodes of colorectal cancer patients.\r"

Three general patterns of cellular responses were observed. Cells from some DLN (17%) were unresponsive to any stimuli. Lymphocytes from 52% of the DLN responded moderately to rIL-2 alone. The combination of rIL-2 and tumor antigen had a synergistic effect on the proliferation of cells from 31% of the DLN assayed. Phorbol dibutyrate and ionomycin plus rIL-2 stimulated expansion of DLN lymphocytes by up to 850-fold after 35 days. These expanded cell populations, as well as those stimulated with antigen plus rIL-2, were predominantly CD3+ and CD16- cells, varying in proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Both populations were cytotoxic against autologous tumor, MCF-7, and K562 target cells.\r"

In 1977 the first cases were reported in the mamma, followed by descriptions of argyrophilic carcinoid-like, neuroendocrine mammary tumours by many investigators who performed immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations. The existence of true carcinoids in the mamma is still a controversial issue. Eight mammary neoplasms with monomorphous cytonuclear features, five of the small cell carcinoid-like variety and three composed of larger cells, were examined by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examination. We believe this kind of tumours are ductal or lobular carcinomas with focal or more extensive neuroendocrine features and are the result of a dual differentiation of neoplastic precursor stem cells along epithelial and endocrine lines. Consequently, we consider that treatment of such cases should not be different from that of the ordinary type of mammary carcinomas.\r"

Three years later, she gave birth to a normal baby. She attempted breast feeding and had full lactation from the untreated breast. The irradiated breast underwent only minor changes during pregnancy and postpartum but produced small amounts of colostrum and milk for 2 weeks postpartum. There are only a few reports of lactation after breast irradiation. These cases are reviewed, and possible factors affecting breast function after radiotherapy are discussed. Because of scant information available regarding its safety for the infant, nursing from the irradiated breast is not recommended.\r"

The host reaction was recognized histologically from the 3rd or 4th day to the 9th day. However, the immune reaction did not significantly influence the evaluation of SRCA until the 7th day. The immunohistochemical staining with anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody revealed the existence of cancer cells at the DNA synthesizing stage (S stage) in the graft until the 7th day. In chemosensitivity test by SRCA, 21 patients were studied, and all were evaluable. 5-FU administration produced a response in 8/21 cases (38.1%), VDS in 8/21 (38.1%), and CDDP in 3/21 (14.3%).

In contrast, gastric mucosa with chronic inflammation, tissues with incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, and carcinoma demonstrated both HLA-DR and SC in almost the same area and also prominent lymphoid infiltration in the surrounding stroma. This simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and SC was not observed in complete type of intestinal metaplasia.

A slight female preponderance was present in cases with inguinal NHL. Histologic and immunohistologic findings showed that nodal NHL were heterogeneous; (1) T-cell type was frequent in the neck but exceptional in other sites, (2) frequency of high-grade tumors was much higher in the intra-abdominal cavity but low in other sites, and (3) follicular lymphoma was common in the submandibular and inguinal regions. Previous studies indicated that histologic and/or immunologic types of NHL correlated with pathogenesis of lymphoma; EB virus and HTLV-1 for B and T lymphomagenesis, respectively, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for development of high-grade tumors. The present results may provide an insight to consider as a possible pathogenesis of NHL.\r"

Of seven good-risk patients classified as Child's class A or B, gastrectomy together with selective shunt operation was performed in two, total gastrectomy with splenectomy in three, and distal partial gastrectomy with paraesophageal devascularization without splenectomy in one. The remaining patient with early gastric cancer underwent distal partial gastrectomy following repeated endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) for treatment of the esophageal varices. Although the majority of patients who underwent surgical repair of varices (i.e., shunt, splenectomy, or devascularization) died, total gastrectomy with splenectomy was the only procedure that led to control of the esophageal varices. Since partial gastrectomy combined with EIS limits the morbidity and mortality of an extensive resection and at the same time controls esophageal variceal bleeding, it is probably the procedure of choice for patients with a carcinoma in the lower two-thirds of the stomach. Concerning non-surgical cases, two patients were effectively treated using laser endoscopy and EIS, without the occurrence of variceal bleeding. The remaining four patients, given chemotherapy or irradiation for treatment of gastric carcinoma, died within 4 months with variceal bleeding or liver failure. For the poor-risk patients with evidence of severe liver dysfunction, laser treatment and EIS would be the treatment of choice.\r"

  ".U": "91124822\r", 
  ".W": "Combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation produces tumor regression in most patients with small-cell lung cancer, but the impact on survival has been small, and less than 20% of patients with limited disease survive 2 years. Survival time is extremely short after failure to respond or relapse after treatment. Local control remains a problem, with one third of patients having recurrence only at the primary site. In an attempt to prolong survival and perhaps achieve cure, we undertook surgical resection in 28 patients with limited small-cell lung cancer who did not have complete remission with standard treatment or who had only local recurrence after treatment. There were 28 patients, 22 male and six female, median age 61 years (range 41 to 76). All patients had been treated with chemotherapy and 13 had received preoperative radiotherapy to the primary site and mediastinum. Eight patients underwent an operation for relapse after complete remission. Five patients had had no response to treatment, three had had a slight response followed by progression during chemotherapy, and 12 had achieved partial response but had greater than 3 cm residual masses. Twelve patients required pneumonectomy, 15 lobectomy, one patient had unresectable disease, and two had bulky residual masses after the operation. Three others had microscopic residual disease. Pathologic examination showed only small-cell lung cancer in 18 patients, mixed small-cell and non-small-cell in four, and only non-small-cell lung cancer in six. There were only four patients with stage I disease, 10 with stage II, and 14 with stage III. The median survival from the date of diagnosis for the entire group is 105 weeks and from the date of operation, 74 weeks. The projected 5-year survival rate is 23%. The two patients with residual masses died with local progression, and distant metastatic disease developed in 17 others. One patient died at 6 years without recurrent disease. Eight patients are alive 2 to 5 years after diagnosis. Seven of these patients required only a lobectomy, four had stage I disease, two had stage II, and two had stage III disease. Five had pure small-cell lung cancer and three had mixed small-cell and non-small-cell tumors. All of the patients with pathologic stage I disease remain alive compared with one of 10 with stage II disease and two of 14 with stage III. In summary, relapse or failure to respond to chemotherapy may be due to non-small-cell lung cancer or a mixed tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the present study the relationship between pulmonary arterial flow and retrograde bronchial blood flow, and the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on bronchial blood flow were evaluated by laser Doppler velocimetry in an isolated in situ lung perfusion model. Nine adult mongrel dogs were exsanguinated by way of a left atrial cannula. Blood was pumped by a roller pump into the main pulmonary artery. Lungs were perfused at random flow (in 0.5 L/min increments) at rates of 1 to 3 L/min. Steady-state laser Doppler velocimetric measurements at each level of flow were made at the tracheal carina and both bronchial carina. Pump flow was then set at baseline cardiac output and positive end-expiratory pressure was applied. Steady-state laser Doppler velocimetric measurements were obtained at each level of positive end-expiratory pressure (5 cm H2O and 10 cm H2O). Bronchial blood flow correlated well with pulmonary arterial flow (for the tracheal carina; rs = 0.912 and p less than 0.0005; for the right bronchial carina, rs = 0.799, p less than 0.0005; for the left bronchial carina, rs = 0.917, p less than 0.0005; where rs is the common correlation coefficient). The bronchial blood flow at the left bronchial carina and the right bronchial carina were significantly higher than at the tracheal carina (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.05, respectively). At baseline cardiac output, bronchial blood flow in the in situ model was approximately 50% lower than observed in the intact animals. Positive end-expiratory pressure increased the bronchial blood flow at the tracheal carina and both bronchial carina (p less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive series of 7104 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting during an 18-year period (1971 to 1988) included 469 patients older than 75 years. Results were analyzed to determine comparative risk factors for morbidity, early and late survival, and functional outcome. Patients younger than 75 years (group I) and patients older than 75 years (group II) were identical for ejection fraction and standard hemodynamic indices. Mean number of grafts and crossclamp time were greater for group II patients (p less than 0.01). Mean age of group I was 58.6 years and group II, 77.6 years (p less than 0.01). Women composed 19.7% (1308/6635) of group I and 36.2% (170/469) of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Mammary grafts were placed in 57.7% (3830/6635) of group I and 41.6% (195/469) of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Overall perioperative mortality rate was 2.1% for group I and 6.8% for group II (p less than 0.05). Perioperative myocardial infarction rate was similar for the two groups. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, renal insufficiency, neurologic complications, prolonged ventilatory support, increased hospital cost, and prolonged hospitalization were significantly more prevalent (all p less than 0.05) in patients older than 75 years. Five and 10 years postoperatively, there were no significant differences between groups I and II with regard to event-free status including angina, myocardial infarction, and reoperation. The 5-year survival rate was 92% for group I and 80% for group II (p less than 0.05), similar to that of age-matched control subjects. The significantly increased potential for complications and expense of coronary bypass in patients over 75 years of age mandates judicious patient selection and preoperative counseling. Despite a significantly increased early mortality and an anticipated decreased long-term survival paralleling normal life table survival curves, good intermediate functional improvement can be realized in patients older than 75 years, comparable with that expected in a much younger age group.\r"

In two cases a concomitant Fontan operation was performed. In each patient the right ventricle was very small and right ventricular pressure was higher than systemic pressure. Ventricle-coronary connections provided flow of desaturated blood from the right ventricle into the coronary arteries in 11 of 12 cases. Five of the 12 children did not survive operation and postmortem examination of each revealed severe acute and chronic myocardial ischemic damage and high-grade obstruction or interruption of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Preoperative angiography demonstrated occlusive changes in the coronary arteries, resulting in right ventricular dependent circulation, in all five children who died and in one child who survived operation. Seven children who survived operation are well 4 months to 3.5 years later. Two have undergone subsequent successful Fontan operation and two others are considered suitable candidates for this operation. Tricuspid valve closure is recommended for a carefully selected group of infants with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum provided a right ventricular-dependent coronary circulation can be excluded on the basis of preoperative coronary cineangiography.\r"

  ".U": "91124827\r", 
  ".W": "Activated leukocytes are thought to contribute to respiratory dysfunction, alterations in microvascular permeability, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thrombosis, all of which can complicate extracorporeal circulation. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of extracorporeal circulation on leukocyte functions likely to mediate organ damage. White blood cell counts in the bubble circuits (n = 5) fell to 51% +/- 7% (mean +/- standard error of the mean; p less than 0.05) of initial levels within 2 hours of recirculation. In contrast, counts from both the spiral coil (n = 5) and hollow-fiber (n = 5) groups remained at 91% +/- 12% and 100%, respectively. Plasma levels of human neutrophil elastase rose from 0.28 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml to 3.14 +/- 0.36 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05) and 0.20 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml to 1.61 +/- 0.35 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05) in bubble and spiral coil circuits, respectively, but from only 0.20 +/- 0.03 micrograms/ml to 0.96 +/- 0.42 micrograms/ml in the hollow-fiber circuit despite 2 hours of recirculation. Consistently, in response to N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine, a chemotactic peptide, cells from spiral coil and bubble circuits released and generated significantly less elastase and superoxide anion, respectively. In contrast, neutrophils from the hollow-fiber circuits demonstrated enhancement of N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine-induced elastase release and superoxide generation. Finally, mixed leukocytes from all circuits expressed procoagulant activity reaching statistical significance in bubble circuits. In conclusion, extracorporeal circulation has pronounced effects on neutrophil elastase release, superoxide anion generation, and leukocyte procoagulant activity. Spiral coil and bubble oxygenators cause granule release and, subsequently, reduced sensitivity to soluble agonists. In contrast, hollow-fiber oxygenators \"prime\" cells, actually enhancing reactivity. Recirculation through all circuits induces leukocyte procoagulant activity that is likely to contribute to surface-induced thromboses and excessive bleeding.\r"

Postoperative decrease in T helper (CD4), T suppressor (CD8), and B lymphocyte counts; decrease or reversal of the CD4/CD8 ratio; and poor in vitro response to mitogens have also been observed. Similar changes in lymphocyte number and function have also been noted in patients receiving transfusions. To determine whether observed changes after cardiopulmonary bypass are related to the bypass itself or to associated blood transfusions, we conducted a study of lymphocyte subsets in transfused and nontransfused patients. A flow cytometric analysis of seven lymphocyte subpopulations was conducted in 18 patients undergoing bypass, eight of whom did not receive a transfusion. The transfused group comprised recipients of both homologous (n = 8) and autologous (n = 2) blood. Total lymphocytes and lymphocytes with markers for CD3 (pan-T cells), CD4, and CD8 decreased significantly postoperatively independent of transfusion. B lymphocytes decreased postoperatively in both the autologous transfusion and no transfusion groups. However, this trend was not seen in patients receiving homologous blood, and three of these patients had evidence of T cell activation, suggestive of an immune response to homologous transfusion. Bypass produces significant changes in selected lymphocyte subsets. Furthermore, simultaneous homologous blood transfusion may specifically elicit an immune response in some patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Flows from left atrium to femoral artery ranged between 20 and 100 ml/kg/min during circulatory assistance. In preischemic, ejecting hearts increasing flow through the left ventricular assist device progressively decreased stroke volume, end-diastolic volume, and circumferential systolic wall stress, but only slightly decreased end-systolic volume. In postischemic, ejecting hearts left ventricular assistance progressively and substantially decreased both end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume; at high flows, end-systolic volume returned to the normal range of preischemic hearts. High flows through the assist device also shifted end-systolic points of pressure-volume loops leftward and increased the stroke work/end-diastolic volume ratio in ejecting postischemic hearts; these observations raise the possibility that left ventricular circulatory assistance acutely improves myocardial contractility of postischemic hearts.\r"

  ".W": "In animal models using left ventricular assist systems over long time periods, myocardial cellular atrophy has been reported, raising concern that prolonged clinical use of such systems might lead to deterioration in left ventricular function. At the University of Pittsburgh, long-term clinical use of the Novacor (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Novacor Div., Oakland, Calif.) left ventricular support system for patients awaiting heart transplants has allowed study of the effects of long-term mechanical support on human subjects. This study determined that cardiac myocyte dimension is initially greater in patients with end-stage cardiac disease who require support rather than in patients with the same disease who do not require such support. Although myocyte dimension does decrease within a few days of the inception of support, this decrease merely brings cell size closer to the values usual in patients with chronic end-stage cardiac disease, and no further shrinkage is observed. Thus the Novacor left ventricular assist system does not appear associated with left ventricular atrophy, and its long-term use may not be detrimental to left ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of pericardial meshing (multiple incisions on the pericardium) on cardiac function, we examined left ventricular pump performance before and after pericardial meshing in six open chest dogs. We evaluated left ventricular systolic properties with the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relation and diastolic properties with end-diastolic pressure-volume relation (chamber compliance). Overall left ventricular performance was assessed with end-diastolic pressure versus cardiac output relation. Left ventricular chamber compliance was increased (31.3%) with pericardial meshing compared with direct closure of the pericardium, and cardiac output was increased (26.7%) for any given left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation was not altered in pericardial meshing. These results suggest that pericardial meshing improves left ventricular pump performance as a result of increasing left ventricular chamber compliance. This technique may benefit cardiac pump performance that is depressed by the direct closure of the pericardium after cardiac operations.\r"

  ".W": "Hypothermia is widely acknowledged to be the fundamental component of myocardial protection during cardiac operations. Although it prolongs the period of ischemic arrest by reducing oxygen demands, hypothermia is associated with a number of major disadvantages, including its detrimental effects on enzymatic function, energy generation, and cellular integrity. We hypothesized that the ideal protected state of the heart would be electromechanically arrested and perfused with blood, that is, aerobic arrest. Under these conditions the fundamental need for hypothermia becomes questionable. We have developed a novel approach to myocardial protection during cardiac operations based on these concepts, in which the chemically arrested heart is perfused continuously with blood and maintained at 37 degrees C. In 121 consecutive coronary bypass procedures we have compared this approach with a historical cohort of 133 consecutive patients treated with hypothermic cardioplegia. Perioperative myocardial infarction was significantly less prevalent (1.7% versus 6.8%; p less than 0.05) in the warm cardioplegic group, as was the use of the intraaortic balloon pump (0.9% versus 9.0%; p less than 0.005) and the prevalence of low output syndrome (13.5% versus 3.3%; p less than 0.005). Cardiac output immediately after bypass was significantly higher than before bypass (3.1 +/- 0.9 versus 4.9 +/- 1.0 L/min; p less than 0.001) only in the warm cardioplegia group. Furthermore, the heartbeat in 99.2% of patients treated with continuous warm cardioplegia converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously after removal of the aortic crossclamp compared with only 10.5% of the hypothermic group. The time from removal of the aortic crossclamp to discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (i.e., reperfusion time) was significantly shorter in the warm cardioplegia group (11 +/- 4.3 versus 27 +/- 5.6 minutes; p less than 0.001). Our results suggest that continuous normothermic blood cardioplegia is safe and effective. Conceptually, this represents a new approach to the problem of maintaining excellent myocardial preservation during cardiac operations.\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion of warm blood cardioplegic solution is useful in minimizing reperfusion damage after ischemia. This study tests the hypothesis that overzealous administration of blood cardioplegic solution at reperfusion counteracts these benefits and can lead to a prevalence of depressed ventricular performance and mortality similar to that seen after normal blood reperfusion. Thirty-one dogs underwent 45 minutes of 37 degrees C global ischemia on vented bypass. Six received normal blood reperfusion and 25 were reperfused with a warm aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution; of these, eight received high-dose (3600 +/- 600 ml) and 17 received limited-dose (1180 +/- 120 ml) blood cardioplegic reperfusion over 10 to 20 minutes. High-dose blood cardioplegic perfusion (5100 +/- 200 ml) without prior ischemia was tested in an additional five dogs. High-dose blood cardioplegia without preceding ischemia did not alter ventricular function (peak stroke work index 96% of control). After ischemia, normal blood reperfusion (no cardioplegia) resulted in marked left ventricular dysfunction (peak stroke work index 36% of control, p less than 0.05 versus control) and a 33% mortality rate (2/6 died). High-dose cardioplegic reperfusion yielded marginal recovery of stroke work index (40% of control, p less than 0.05 versus control) and a 25% mortality rate (2/8 died). In contrast, limited-dose reperfusion of blood cardioplegic solution allowed 100% survival (17/17) and restored stroke work index to 90% of control (1.3 versus 1.45 gm.m/kg). We conclude that reperfusion damage can be avoided by initial reoxygenation with limited doses of substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution. Conversely, high-dose reperfusion of blood cardioplegic solution offsets this benefit, reduces recovery substantially, and may be lethal.\r"

  ".W": "HYPOTHESIS: Initial reoxygenation with blood cardioplegic solution produces better regional recovery than with Fluosol DA cardioplegic solution (Green Cross Corporation, Osaka, Japan) because blood cardioplegia ensures delivery of important blood components (i.e., plasma and red blood cells) that limit reperfusion damage. METHODS: Twenty-five dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by controlled reperfusion at 50 mm Hg through an internal mammary graft on total vented bypass. Five dogs received normal blood reperfusion, 10 dogs received a 20-minute reperfusion with Fluosol DA 20% cardioplegic solution, and 10 others received a blood cardioplegic reperfusate of identical composition (i.e., pH, calcium, potassium, glucose, osmolarity). Regional oxygen consumption was measured during reperfusion, and segmental shortening (ultrasonic crystals), tissue water content, and histochemical damage (triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain) were assessed 2 hours later. RESULTS: Reperfusion with normal blood failed to restore contractile function (3% systolic shortening), caused severe edema (81% water content), and caused marked histochemical damage (48% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining). Hearts reperfused with Fluosol DA cardioplegic solution did not take up as much oxygen as hearts receiving blood cardioplegic reperfusion (37 versus 54 ml/100 gm, p less than 0.05). Blood cardioplegia was superior to Fluosol DA cardioplegia in recovery of segmental contractility (69% versus 34% systolic shortening, p less than 0.05), produced less edema (79.5% versus 80.9% water content, p less than 0.05), and produced less histochemical damage with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (11% versus 40% area of nonstaining/area at risk, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Initial reperfusion with a blood cardioplegic solution ensures better oxygen utilization, superior recovery of regional contractility, and less tissue damage than Fluosol DA cardioplegic reperfusion. These data emphasize the importance of including blood components (plasma or red blood cells) in the oxygenated cardioplegic reperfusate to limit reperfusion injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests whether initial asanguineous washout of potentially toxic substances that accumulate during ischemia improves recovery produced by blood cardioplegic reperfusion and evaluates the role of plasma versus whole blood cardioplegia. METHODS: Twenty-four dogs underwent 2 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 20 minutes of blood cardioplegic reperfusion on total vented bypass. In 13 dogs, a 5-minute infusion of either a crystalloid (n = 7) or plasma (n = 6) cardioplegic solution (containing the same pH, calcium potassium, and osmolarity as blood cardioplegia) was given immediately before reoxygenation with blood cardioplegia. Regional oxygen uptake and coronary vascular resistance were measured during controlled reperfusion, and segmental shortening (ultrasonic crystals), tissue water content, and histochemical damage (triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain) were assessed 1 hour after bypass was discontinued. RESULTS: Asanguineous cardioplegic washout before reoxygenation with blood cardioplegic solution resulted in a progressive (+42%) increase in coronary vascular resistances (from 123 to 176 units, p less than 0.05) and low oxygen utilization during 20 minutes of blood cardioplegic reperfusion (29 ml/100 gm, p less than 0.05); coronary vascular resistance remained low throughout blood cardioplegic reperfusion without washout (from 109 to 98 units), and oxygen utilization was 54 ml/100 gm (p less than 0.05). Neither plasma nor crystalloid washout restored substantial regional systolic shortening (3% systolic shortening versus 73% systolic shortening with blood cardioplegia), and asanguineous washout caused more myocardial edema (81.1% +/- 80.9% versus 79.5% water content, p less than 0.05) and produced extensive transmural triphenyltetrazolium chloride damage (48% +/- 41% versus 8% nonstaining in area at risk, p less than 0.05) than initial blood cardioplegic reperfusion. CONCLUSION: Asanguineous cardioplegic washout before blood cardioplegic reperfusion limits oxygen utilization during subsequent controlled reperfusion, restricts early recovery of systolic shortening, allows more myocardial edema, and produces extensive histochemical damage, which may be avoided by initial reoxygenation with blood cardioplegia. The red blood cells appear more important than the plasma components of blood cardioplegia.\r"

  ".W": "Postischemic damage is caused partially by oxygen free radical-mediated injury. This study will show that (1) crystalloid cardioplegia with room air oxygen is deleterious because it is devoid of free radical scavengers and (2) blood cardioplegia limits damage because it contains endogenous free radical scavengers in red blood cells. METHODS: Thirty-two dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 20 minutes of regional blood cardioplegic reperfusion on bypass. Ten dogs received only the blood cardioplegic solution (containing its endogenous free radical scavengers); five received initial blood cardioplegia (5 minutes) with endogenous free radical scavengers (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) blocked by aminotriazole and N-ethylmaleimide, respectively; 12 received initial crystalloid cardioplegic solution oxygenated by room air (oxygen tension = 150 mm Hg); seven without and five with exogenous free radical scavengers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, coenzyme Q10); five received initial deoxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution (oxygen tension = 6 mm Hg); and five received deoxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution. RESULTS: Blood cardioplegia with endogenous free radical scavengers produced the best recovery of systolic shortening (69% systolic shortening) and resulted in the least histochemical damage (11% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining). The worst recovery and most damage occurred if blood cardioplegia was preceded by oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia (3% systolic shortening, 48% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining; p less than 0.05 versus blood cardioplegia) or if free radical scavengers were blocked in the initial period of blood cardioplegia (3% systolic shortening, 41% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining; p less than 0.05 versus blood cardioplegia). Conversely, deoxygenation or supplementation of oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution with exogenous free radical scavengers restored 60% systolic shortening (p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia) and 54% systolic shortening (p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia) and reduced damage to 34% and 21% (both p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia). CONCLUSION: Blood cardioplegic solutions containing their own endogenous free radical scavengers are superior to crystalloid cardioplegic solutions, because they limit oxygen-mediated perfusion damage and restore contractile function. Initial crystalloid cardioplegic washout negates the salutary effect of blood cardioplegia. Exogenous free radical scavenger supplementation or deoxygenation of the cardioplegic reperfusate is necessary only if crystalloid cardioplegia is used.\r"

  ".U": "91124837\r", 
  ".W": "The concentration of calcium (1.2 mmol/L) in clinical St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution was chosen several years ago after dose-response studies in the normothermic isolated heart. However, recent studies with creatine phosphate in St. Thomas' Hospital solution demonstrated that additional myocardial protection during hypothermia resulted principally from its calcium-lowering effect in the solution. The isolated working rat heart model was therefore used to establish the optimal calcium concentration in St. Thomas' Hospital solution during lengthy hypothermic ischemia (20 degrees C, 300 minutes). The calcium content of standard St. Thomas' Hospital solution was varied from 0.0 to 1.5 mmol/L in eight treatment groups (n = 6 for each group). During ischemia, hearts were exposed to multidose cardioplegia (3 minutes every 30 minutes). Postischemic recovery of function was expressed as a percentage of preischemic control values. Release of creatine kinase and the time to return of sinus rhythm during the reperfusion period were also measured. These dose-response studies during hypothermic ischemia revealed a broad range of acceptable calcium concentrations (0.3 to 0.9 mmol/L), which appear optimal in St. Thomas' Hospital solution at 0.6 mmol/L. This concentration improved the postischemic recovery of aortic flow from 22.0% +/- 5.9% with control St. Thomas' Hospital solution (calcium concentration 1.2 mmol/L) to 86.0% +/- 4.0% (p less than 0.001). Other indices of functional recovery showed similar dramatic results. Creatine kinase release was reduced 84% (p less than 0.01) in the optimal calcium group. Postischemic reperfusion arrhythmias were diminished with the loser calcium concentration, with a significant decrease in the time between initial reperfusion until the return of sinus rhythm. In contrast, acalcemic St. Thomas' Hospital solution precipitated the calcium paradox with massive enzyme release and no functional recovery. Unlike prior published calcium dose-response studies at normothermia, these results demonstrate that the optimal calcium concentration during clinically relevant hypothermic ischemia is considerably lower than that of normal serum ionized calcium (1.2 mmol/L) and appears ideal at 0.6 mmol/L to realize even greater cardioprotective and antiarrhythmic effects with St. Thomas' Hospital solution.\r"

The experiments were performed with an isolated neonatal (7 to 10 days of age) working heart model in which normothermic (37 degrees C) ischemia was produced for 60 minutes. Left ventricular developed pressure, ratio of change of ventricular pressure to change in time, and aortic flow were measured before ischemia and 30 minutes after reperfusing the hearts with physiologic saline solution. In the control group (ischemia only), developed pressure and ratio of change of ventricular pressure to change in time recovered to 27% +/- 3% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and 24% +/- 7% of baseline; the hearts were incapable of ejecting (aortic flow = 0). Treatment of hearts before and after ischemia with catalase (150 units/ml of perfusate) was studied in a second group (control plus catalase), but functional recovery (developed pressure = 32% +/- 1%; ratio of change of ventricular pressure to change in time = 24% +/- 2%, and aortic flow = 0) was not significantly different from the control group. The effect of washout midway through the ischemic period with a low oxygen (oxygen concentration less than 35 mm Hg) solution was measured in a third group (hypoxic physiologic saline solution). Functional recovery (developed pressure = 13% +/- 3%; ratio of change of ventricular su pressure to change in time = 13% + 2%; aortic flow = 0) was not significantly different from the control and control plus catalase groups. In marked contrast were the effects of washout with an oxygenated (oxygen concentration greater than 500 mm Hg) solution (oxygenated physiologic saline solution) in which functional recovery (developed pressure = 78% +/- 3%; ratio of change of ventricular pressure to change in time = 80% +/- 3%; aortic flow = 39% +/- 9%) was significantly better than in the control, control plus catalase, and hypoxic physiologic saline solution groups. Use of modified St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution (cardioplegic solution group) during the ischemic period also resulted in substantial functional recovery (developed pressure = 80% +/- 3%; ratio of change of ventricular pressure to change in time = 78% +/- 5%; aortic flow = 64% +/- 7%) that did not differ significantly from that in the oxygenated physiologic saline solution group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Compared with a control (no ouabain) group, both low- and high-dose ouabain groups had increased left ventricular diastolic chamber stiffness (\"contracture\") during and after the arrest period. The high-dose ouabain group also showed less recovery of contractile function than did the control group. We conclude that digitalis glycosides have the potential to impair recovery of myocardial function in the newborn infant after hypothermic/ischemic arrest; myocardial relaxation and diastolic function appear more sensitive to this manifestation of digitalis toxicity than does contractile function.\r"

All animals underwent cardiopulmonary bypass, cooling to 20 degrees C, 120 minutes of circulatory arrest, rewarming with cardiopulmonary bypass, and 1 hour off extracorporeal support with continuous hemodynamic and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic evaluation. Group I (n = 5) was cooled to 20 degrees C; group II (n = 4) was given a single dose of 20 degrees C cardioplegic solution; group III (n = 7) was given a single dose of 4 degrees C cardioplegic solution; and group IV (n = 4) received 4 degrees C cardioplegic solution every 30 minutes. At end ischemia, adenosine triphosphate, expressed as a percent of control value, was lowest in group I 54% +/- 6.5% but only slightly greater in group II 66% +/- 7.0%. Use of 4 degrees C cardioplegic solution in groups III and IV resulted in a significant decrease in myocardial temperature, 9.9 degrees C versus 17 degrees to 20 degrees C, and significantly higher levels of adenosine triphosphate at end ischemia; with group III levels at 72% +/- 6.0% and group IV levels at 73% +/- 6.0%. Recovery of adenosine triphosphate with reperfusion was not related to the level of adenosine triphosphate at end ischemia and was best in groups I and II, with a recovery level of 95% +/- 4.0%. In group IV, no recovery of adenosine triphosphate occurred with reperfusion, resulting in a significantly lower level of adenosine triphosphate, 74% +/- 6.0%, than in groups I and II. Recovery of ventricular function was good for all groups but was best in hearts receiving a single dose of 4 degrees C cardioplegic solution. In this model, multiple doses of cardioplegic solution were not associated with either improved adenosine triphosphate retention during arrest or improved ventricular function after reperfusion, and in fact resulted in a significantly lower level of adenosine triphosphate with reperfusion. The complete recovery of adenosine triphosphate in groups I and II, despite a nearly 50% adenosine triphosphate loss during ischemia, may result from a decrease in the catabolism of the metabolites of adenosine triphosphate consumption in the newborn heart.\r"

Of 14 dogs reperfused with substrate-enriched (hyperkalemic) blood cardioplegic solution, six received a cardioplegic solution with a leukocyte count less than 100/mm3. RESULTS: Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reduced reperfusion-induced arrhythmias from 63% to 17% (p less than 0.05). Coronary vascular resistance at initial reperfusion was low and remained low during substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic reperfusion with both normal and reduced leukocyte counts. In contrast, coronary vascular resistance rose 63% with normal blood reperfusion, and this increase was avoided by leukocyte depletion (2.6 versus 4.0 mm Hg x ml/min, p less than 0.05). Coronary vascular resistance after 20 minutes was, however, higher than that with blood cardioplegia with normal or decreased leukocyte counts. Negligible functional recovery followed reperfusion with normal blood and leukocyte-depleted blood (12% and 6% of control systolic shortening). In contrast, substantial segmental recovery followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion (73% systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) but was not improved by leukopheresis (81% systolic shortening). Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reperfusate reduced histochemical damage from 53% to 38% (p less than 0.05), but the least histochemical damage followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion with a normal or reduced leukocyte count (8% or 11%, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role for leukocytes in reperfusion damage, but reperfusate leukocyte filtration alone is inferior to blood cardioplegic reperfusion. Leukocyte depletion of blood cardioplegic solutions seems unnecessary after only 2 hours of ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "To improve compliance with a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease a simple prototype test kit was developed to detect gluten in foods for use at home. The test is based on monoclonal antibodies to heat-stable gluten proteins which crossreact appropriately with barley and rye proteins. It is suitable for use with a wide range of raw or cooked foods. The food is extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid and 1 drop of the extract transferred to an antibody-coated tube; enzyme-labelled gluten detection antibody is added and after 3 min the tube is washed and colour developer is added. The reaction is stopped after 2 min, stabilising the blue colour. The home kit was compared with a quantitative laboratory kit, and the qualitative agreement was very good. The kit could distinguish foods with trace gluten contents (acceptable for a \"gluten-free\" diet) from those with a slightly higher but unacceptable gluten content. In a trial of the prototype kit by 47 coeliac disease patients of diverse ages and educational backgrounds, 93% of tests correctly identified foods as acceptable or unacceptable.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that the high mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in South Asians settled overseas compared with other populations is due to metabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance was tested in a population survey of 3193 men and 561 women aged 40-69 years in London, UK. The sample was assembled from industrial workforces and general practitioners' lists. In comparison with the European group, the South Asian group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19% vs 4%), higher blood pressures, higher fasting and post-glucose serum insulin concentrations, higher plasma triglyceride, and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations. Mean waist-hip girth ratios and trunk skinfolds were higher in the South Asian than in the European group. Within each ethnic group waist-hip ratio was correlated with glucose intolerance, insulin, blood pressure, and triglyceride. These results confirm the existence of an insulin resistance syndrome, prevalent in South Asian populations and associated with a pronounced tendency to central obesity in this group. Control of obesity and greater physical activity offer the best chances for prevention of diabetes and CHD in South Asian people.\r"

A positive result was defined as a mean dilution titre of 2 or more. Eight of eighteen BPSHL patients had positive titres--significantly (p less than 0.005) more than in any other group (one Meniere's disease, two otosclerosis, and no others). The mean antibody titre was higher in the BPSHL group than in any other group (2.02 [SEM 0.62] vs 0.17 [0.17]) Meniere's disease, 0.44 [0.32] otosclerosis, 0 all others; p less than 0.005). The nine BPSHL patients who showed a clinical response to corticosteroids (improvement in at least one tone by audiogram or 25 db in speech discrimination score) had the highest mean antibody titre (3.46 [0.88] vs 0.59 [0.59] for the nine non-responsive patients; p less than 0.04). We suggest that in some patients with BPSHL, immunity to type II collagen, a major constituent of the inner ear, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disorder.\r"

We investigated the extent to which the timing of progression to AIDS can be explained solely in terms of decline of the CD4 lymphocyte count in 111 haemophiliacs followed for up to 11 years since infection with HIV. A median of 10 CD4 lymphocyte counts were made per patient. By applying a simple linear model for the decline in CD4 lymphocyte counts over time, we estimated the date of development of AIDS in 96 patients who had at least 5 determinations. 84% (81 of 96) of patients were correctly classified as to development of AIDS before Jan 1, 1990 (p less than 0.0001), with this model. The results suggest that differences in the time at which patients with HIV will progress to AIDS can largely be explained by differences in rates of decline of CD4 lymphocyte counts.\r"

Chronic stimulating electrodes connected to a pulse generator were implanted in the Vim. Tremor amplitude at rest, during posture holding, and during action and intention manoeuvres was assessed by means of accelerometry. Of the 43 thalami stimulated, 27 showed complete relief from tremor and 11 major improvement (88%). The improvement was maintained for up to 29 months (mean follow-up 13 [SD 9] months). Adverse effects were mild and could be eradicated by reduction or cessation of stimulation. This reversibility and adaptability, allowing control of side-effects, make thalamic stimulation preferable to thalamotomy, especially when treatment of both sides of the brain is needed.\r"

This assessment has been made by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) after a national survey of radon levels in homes, when more houses than anticipated were found to have high levels, and after a reappraisal upwards of the effectiveness of radon and its daughter products in causing lung cancer. A review of the scientific evidence reveals no direct evidence to incriminate radon or its decay products at the levels found in our homes in lung cell carcinogenesis. The issue involves different scientific disciplines and is highly complex. Debate between scientists is required and more epidemiological studies of lung cancer and low radon exposure are necessary. Meanwhile the indirect evidence linking low levels of radon exposure to lung cancer is insufficient to warrant the remedial action proposed by the NRPB and accepted by the UK government.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that the different molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which can be revealed by isoelectric focusing may reflect changes in AChE in pathologically affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease was tested in a retrospective study. CSF samples obtained at necropsy from 33 patients with clinically diagnosed dementia, 9 with possible dementia, and 19 without a diagnosis of dementia were examined by isoelectric focusing. An additional band indicating an anomalous molecular form of AChE was present in CSF from 19 of 23 patients with a histological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and no other central nervous system disorder but in none of the 19 non-demented patients (without a histological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease). The band was also present in 2 of 8 patients with histologically defined Alzheimer's disease plus other neurological disorders and in 4 of 8 patients with possible dementia who did not meet histopathological criteria for Alzheimer's disease. The absence of the anomalous form of AChE from the CSF of non-demented patients and its presence in the CSF of the majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease has implications for our understanding of the biological basis of the disease and might form the basis of an antemortem diagnostic test.\r"

These findings support suggestions of aberrant glutamatergic function in schizophrenia. Evidence that gene expression may be abnormal in schizophrenia, with decreased production of an excitatory neurotransmitter receptor, may have therapeutic as well as pathogenetic implications.\r"

  ".W": "In a comparison of spontaneous continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration (CAVH) and pump-driven haemofiltration (PDHF) for acute renal failure after surgery, 116 patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit were assigned CAVH (48) or PDHF (68). The method of assignment was that a patient was treated by PDHF if he or she was the only patient requiring treatment at that time (only one pump was available); any other patient coming to the unit would be treated by CAVH. The groups were slightly unbalanced because there were fewer simultaneous cases than expected. The main endpoints were survival rate, control of uraemia, and additional application of haemodialysis. There were no differences between the patient groups in age, duration of treatment, severity of illness, serum creatinine concentration at the start of treatment, or cause of acute renal failure. Both treatments adequately controlled uraemia and fluid overload. However, the survival rate was significantly higher with PDHF than with CAVH (6 [12.5%] vs 20 [29.4%]; p less than 0.05). The daily ultrafiltrate volume was significantly higher with PDHF than with CAVH (15.7 [95% confidence interval 13.6-17.8] vs 7.0 [6.6-7.4] l/day; p less than 0.05). The volume of ultrafiltrate in patients with ischaemic or sepsis-induced acute renal failure was correlated with the survival rate. This finding suggests that the better survival rate in the PDHF group was due to faster elimination of toxic mediators (of molecular weight 800-1000 daltons) through the filter membrane by high-volume haemofiltration.\r"

The study was made double-blind by the use of two infusion pumps throughout; during the active subcutaneous infusion the intravenous pump delivered saline and vice versa. Serial measurements of pain intensity, pain relief, mood, and sedation by means of visual analogue scales showed no clinically or statistically significant difference between the two infusion routes. Side-effects were slight, and the mean number of morphine injections for breakthrough pain did not differ significantly between the routes (4.8 [SD 4.5] for intravenous vs 5.3 [5.6] for subcutaneous). Plasma hydromorphone concentrations measured at 24 h and 48 h of infusion showed stable steady-state pharmacokinetics; the mean bioavailability from subcutaneous infusion was 78% of that with intravenous infusion. Because of the simplicity, technical advantages, and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous opioid infusion into the chest wall or trunk, intravenous opioid infusion for the management of severe cancer pain should be abandoned.\r"

To see how common relapsing fever is in Senegal thick blood smears from cases of fever of unknown origin and from randomly selected clinic outpatients from a rural dispensary were examined for Borrelia. The prevalence of Borrelia infections in small mammals was also assessed. Borrelia was seen in smears of 12 (0.9%) of 1340 children. All children who tested positive had complained of acute fever. Prevalence was 0% (0/496), 0.5% (2/417), 1.6% (5/308), and 4.2% (5/119) at ages 0-1, 2-4, 5-9, and 10-14, respectively. 26 other instances of borreliosis were seen in patients from different regions of Senegal. Blood samples from 7 of these patients were inoculated intraperitoneally into white mice; serious infection developed in all mice. Borrelia was seen in thick smears from 65 of 461 wild rodents or insectivores. Six rodents species were infected. From a sample of 93 rodents, 33.3% were infected, as judged by intraperitoneal inoculation of white mice, compared with 14.1% by direct smear examination. The findings suggest that borreliosis has a wide distribution and a high incidence in Senegal. This disease may be a major cause of morbidity in rural areas throughout much of West Africa.\r"

The emergence of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has allowed early detection of minute intracanalicular eighth-nerve tumors, less than 1 cm in diameter. Recombinant DNA studies have clarified the genetics that underlie neurofibromatosis type 2 and separate it from a variety of related conditions, such as von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. Early diagnosis and surgical removal of these tumors may offer the only hope of preserving hearing and facial nerve function. A report of the evaluation and treatment of a family with multiple affected individuals will exemplify these conclusions.\r"

The efficacy of most of these substances and techniques has been judged primarily on clinical impressions. Because of the paucity of prospective studies, a randomized, prospective, double-blind study, using the patients as their own controls, was conducted. Ninety-two patients were injected before tonsillectomy in a random, double-blind fashion with normal saline solution in one tonsil and 1:100,000 epinephrine in the other. The blood loss, time of dissection, and postoperative bleeding were recorded separately for each tonsil. Cardiac manifestations were also monitored. The tonsils injected with epinephrine had a statistically significant reduction in blood loss and dissection time when compared with those injected with normal saline. Subjectively, dissection was easier on the epinephrine-injected side. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. Cardiac manifestations of epinephrine were minimal and transient. This study demonstrates that epinephrine is useful in reducing hemorrhage during tonsillectomy and can be used safely with the appropriate inhalation anesthetics.\r"

Thirty-eight patients with suspected recurrent neoplasms comprise this study: 30 had computed tomography scans, 4 had magnetic resonance images, and 4 patients underwent both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to assess the anatomical extent of pathology in 34 malignant and 4 benign tumors. Contrast enhancement was essential for detecting disease on computed tomography scan. Differentiation of recurrent tumor was more difficult when the patient had undergone radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated superior visibility in recurrent parotid and paranasal sinus neoplasm, but was less helpful in laryngeal and pharyngeal recurrences. Computed tomography demonstration of a mass with infiltration of normal fat or tissue planes or lymphadenopathy correlated highly with recurrent disease. Imaging techniques and fine points for determining recurrent neoplasms are presented.\r"

The normal architecture of the vocal cords was preserved because the depth of vaporization was usually superficial in these early cases. Five patients had recurrence, new tumor, or persistence of abnormal tissue that required additional laser surgical treatments. With a follow-up range of 6 months to 4 years, all patients currently are free of laryngeal abnormality, and no patient has needed open laryngeal surgery or radiation therapy. Transoral endoscopic laser resection of laryngeal carcinoma in situ with or without microinvasion should be the treatment of choice for these early lesions.\r"

A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study. The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made.\r"

Most authors have emphasized the role of recurrent cholesteatoma or unexenterated cells in the mastoid cell system as causes of recurrent disease. Seven cases are reported in which clinical evidence indicated that recurrent chronic otitis media was limited to the hypotympanum and infralabyrinthine cell system. In the five cases in which revision surgery was done, exenteration of this area resulted in an asymptomatic ear. The anatomy, radiographic evaluation, and surgical approach to the hypotympanum are reviewed. Careful inspection of the hypotympanum in primary surgery for chronic ear disease and exenteration of the hypotympanic and proximal infralabyrinthine cell tract are advocated when these regions contain cholesteatoma or extensive granulomatous disease.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic sinus surgery has gained wide acceptance since its introduction into the United States. Complex sinus anatomy and troublesome bleeding have been associated with complications, which vary in severity from synechia to blindness and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Endoscopic sinus surgery using a holmium: yttrium aluminum garnet pulsed solid-state laser oscillating at 2.1 microns with fiberoptic delivery was performed in the laboratory, and the results were compared with those of conventional endoscopic sinus surgery. Three beagle dogs, six human cadaver heads, and one calf head were used in the in vivo and in vitro studies to evaluate the bone ablation, tissue coagulation, and hemostatic properties of the holmium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser. Modified endoscopic telescopes for sinus surgery, a newly developed handpiece for fiberoptic delivery, and other surgical instruments were used. The results indicate that the holmium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser and new delivery instrumentation provide good hemostasis and controlled soft-tissue ablation and bone removal. The access to all sinuses in the human cadaver model was very good. The canine in vivo study showed delayed but complete healing on the laser-treated side. Clinical evaluation of the holmium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser is warranted to increase the precision and safety of endoscopic sinus surgery.\r"

These disorders can involve dysfunction in the delicate interrelationship of the skull, mandible, cervical vertebrae, and neuromuscular apparatus and can present as myofacial pain. Electromyographic recordings using surface electrodes were made bilaterally on the masseter, anterior temporalis, and digastric muscles in 641 craniomandibular patients, before and after transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation, at their initial presentation and following the insertion of mandibular orthopedic appliances. In the presenting patient, muscle-resting levels significantly decreased from hyperactive levels with transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation therapy. The creation of a new occlusal position with an orthotic appliance was found to correlate with a significant reduction in otolaryngologic symptoms as well as an increase in maximum muscle activity in function and coordination of muscle groups during mandibular movement. Thus, clinical electromyographic studies are an important aid in the treatment of craniomandibular disorders.\r"

At doses between 0.1 to 1 mg/kg of Rh-123 injected intramuscularly (IM) daily for 5 days, no local or systemic toxicity was observed during the 4 weeks of follow-up. The peak concentrations of Rh-123 in micrograms/g of tissue was distributed as follows: kidney (3.24) greater than heart (2.24) greater than spleen (1.77) greater than lung (0.61) greater than liver (0.38) greater than skin (0.30) greater than skeletal muscle (0.17) greater than genitals (0.13) greater than brain (0.04). The elimination of Rh-123 was very rapid, with the dye falling to 2.7% of peak concentration at 72 hours in the kidneys, and to undetectable levels at 240 hours postinjection in all organs, except the skin, which retained 3% of the peak level at 240 hours. The low toxicity and rapid metabolism of Rh-123 in this preclinical model suggests that the dye and Argon laser may represent an effective combination for treatment of superficial malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "Retention of inflammatory mediators and cells in the middle ear cleft during chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), results in ongoing inflammation with the potential for pathologic changes and hearing loss. Cytokines are glycoproteins produced by macrophages and other cells. Activities of cytokines include fever production, osteoclast, fibroblast, phagocyte and cytotoxic cell activation, regulation of antibody formation, and inhibition of cartilage, bone and endothelial cell growth. Using enzyme-linked immunospecific assays we measured levels of six cytokines in middle ear effusions (MEE) from children with COME. Significant levels of four cytokines: interleukin-1-beta (greater than 50 pg/ml), interleukin-2 (greater than 300 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (greater than 40 pg/ml), and gamma-interferon (greater than 6.25 pg/ml) were found in 51%, 54%, 63%, and 19% of MEE, respectively. In contrast, levels of a fifth cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and a sixth cytokine, interleukin-4, were undetectable. Age was observed to have a significant effect on the levels of specific cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) correlated inversely (P less than .02) with age such that the younger the child, the higher the level of IL-1 in MEE. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) correlated directly (P less than .005) with age such that the older the child, the higher the level of TNF in MEE. Children undergoing tympanostomy on multiple occasions had average MEE TNF levels (234.2 +/- 109.1 pg/mg total protein) that were nearly 14 times higher (P less than .005) than those from children undergoing their first tympanostomy (16.9 +/- 3.0 pg/mg total protein). Thus IL-1 correlated with the early stages of COME, while TNF correlated with persistence of disease. The presence of these cytokines in MEE may be responsible for the mucosal damage, bone erosion, fibrosis, and resulting hearing loss seen in some cases of COME.\r"

Anaerobic bacteria only were present in 10 (43%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 10 (43%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 3 (13%). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 9 infections, 6 of which were Staphylococcus aureus and 3 were anaerobic bacteria. The predominant bacterial isolates were S. aureus (8 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (6 isolates, including 4 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (5). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 11 (73%) of the 15 specimens tested. This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute suppurative parotitis.\r"

Nine cases of sport-diving-induced inner ear injuries that were referred to the Israeli Naval Hyperbaric Institute between October 1987 and September 1989 are presented with regard to evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. The diagnosis was IEB in five divers and IEDS in four. Explorative tympanotomy was carried out with remarkable results in two patients with IEB, while the remaining three were relieved by bed rest alone. Three of the four IEDS patients were recompressed according to the extended US Navy Table 6 with good short-term results. The role of complete otoneurological evaluation in the decision-making process leading to the correct diagnosis and treatment is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "Conventionally, the results of middle ear surgery are reported in terms of postoperative closure of the air-bone gap or the improvement in air-conduction thresholds. While these are relevant in that they assess the technical success of the procedure and the lessening of monaural disability, they do not necessarily assess whether the patient has benefited. This is determined by many factors, not least of which is the hearing in the nonoperated ear. In this paper, we suggest that preoperative and postoperative plots of the air-conduction thresholds in both ears be used as an additional method of presenting the results. First, the proportion of patients that fall into each of three main preoperative impairment groups are identified. This is important, as the potential benefits from surgery are not the same in each group. Thereafter, the percentages of patients that achieve various postoperative hearing categories can be calculated, allowing surgeons to audit their results and make comparisons between series.\r"

Small-fenestra stapedotomy has recently been popularized. Lasers have been advocated for use in fenestrating the stapes footplate. On the other hand, sculpting the middle ear ossicles during tympanoplasty is often necessary for the reconstruction of the ossicular chain and the improvement of sound conduction. Using an excimer laser with a wavelength of 193 nm, fenestrations of the footplate and ossicular sculpting were performed on ossicles obtained during ear surgery and from human cadaver temporal bones. The results indicate that the excimer laser can be used effectively and accurately on an experimental basis and that further research is needed before this method can be used for clinical purposes.\r"
