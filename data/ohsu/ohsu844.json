  ".W": "The plasma glucose and insulin responses to intravenous administration of tolbutamide in patients with insulinoma and healthy control subjects were compared to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the intravenous tolbutamide test for the diagnosis of insulinoma. The records of 406 healthy persons without concurrent disease known to affect glucose homeostasis or insulin concentrations and 41 patients with histologically confirmed insulinoma who underwent standard intravenous tolbutamide testing during the period from 1976 to 1986 were reviewed. The 5th percentile of the mean of plasma glucose levels at the 120-, 150-, and 180-minute points (G120-180) after injection of tolbutamide was 55 mg/dl for lean and 62 mg/dl for obese control subjects. With 95% specificity, the sensitivity of these criteria was 95% for lean and 100% for obese patients with insulinoma. Minimal differences were observed between men and women. At 95% specificity, the sensitivities were less for the ratio of the 180-minute plasma glucose to fasting plasma glucose level (64% in lean and 75% in obese patients), for mean of plasma insulin at the 120-, 150-, and 180-minute points (IRI120-180) (53% in lean and 36% in obese patients), for maximal insulin concentration (27% in lean and 31% in obese patients), for increase in insulin concentration above basal (18% in lean and 23% in obese patients), and for the combined criteria of the 5th percentile of G120-180 and the 95th percentile of IRI120-180 (47% in lean and 73% in obese patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Indeed, diastolic dysfunction may be the earliest indicator of hypertensive heart disease. In this article, the mechanisms governing normal ventricular relaxation and the factors that may cause diastolic dysfunction are reviewed. Noninvasive clinical methods, particularly Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide angiography, for determination of diastolic function are outlined, and the limited experience in the management of hypertensive patients with abnormalities of diastolic function is discussed. When congestive heart failure develops in a patient with hypertension, it is especially important to determine whether it is due primarily to systolic or to diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine decreased significantly by 2.1% (SE 0.8%) in the placebo group and did not significantly change in the tiludronate group (+1.33 [0.8]%). The difference in response between the groups was significant, as were the differences between values for corrected urinary hydroxyproline and calcium. Treatment with tiludronate was not followed by increased secretion of parathyroid hormone. A 6 month course of oral tiludronate may counteract postmenopausal bone loss for at least a year by decreasing bone resorption.\r"

Of ten healthy volunteers, nine met the inclusion criterion of a rise in body temperature of at least 1.0 degrees C after 100 ng endotoxin (Salmonella abortus equi) as a bolus injection. Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were both significantly higher than baseline levels 2 h and 3 h after endotoxin injection. 3 weeks later the nine volunteers were again injected with 100 ng endotoxin and oxpentifylline (500 mg over 4 h) was also infused. There was no rise in TNF levels, though IL-6 levels rose in parallel with body temperature. These data suggest that oxpentifylline blocks the endotoxin-induced synthesis of TNF in man and, therefore, could possibly have beneficial effects in clinical endotoxaemia.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the hypothesis that alteration of T3 receptor expression may be an important mechanism controlling the tissue effects of thyroid hormones in the \"sick euthyroid\" syndrome, specific triiodothyronine (T3) receptor mRNAs were measured in tissues from normal subjects and from patients with liver disease, chronic renal failure, or with multiple organ failure on an intensive care unit (ICU). In all patient groups circulating free thyroxine and free T3 were reduced, while thyroid stimulating hormone remained normal. In patients with liver or renal disease, there were significant increases in levels of both alpha and beta T3 receptor mRNAs in peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs); in ICU patients there was a significant increase in beta mRNA. In patients with liver disease increases in T3 receptor mRNAs were not confined to PMNCs but were also found in liver biopsy specimens when levels were compared with those in normal donor liver. After liver transplantation, receptor mRNAs in PMNCs were similar to those in controls; likewise beta mRNA was similar in liver tissue to normal liver. There was, however, persistent elevation in alpha receptor mRNA. Increases in T3 receptor expression in non-thyroidal illness may be responsible for the maintenance of euthyroidism in the face of reduced levels of circulating thyroid hormones.\r"

The main reasons for this increasing success are 1) the ideal characteristics of the eye as an optical device for excitation of tissue fluorescence and for the detection of the fluorescent emission; 2) the development of novel fluorometric techniques, including differential and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy; and 3) the increasing use of coupling geometries with high-resolution and high spatial selectivity. Both endogenous and exogenous fluorophores are of interest to ocular fluorometry. The most significant among endogenous fluorophores are the fluorescing pigments of the lens and of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The nature, topography, and fluorescence properties of such pigments depend on age and pathology and on the level of light exposure. Exogenous fluorophores of interest are both intentionally induced and unintentionally accumulated drugs (some of which are phototoxic). Laser-based fluorometric techniques play a leading role in ocular fluorometry. The peculiar properties of the laser for the excitation of fluorescence make this source a favorite candidate for ocular fluorometry both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

As an alternative procedure known as \"laser-assisted\" repair, a laser can be used, along with a reduced number of sutures, to reanastomose served peripheral nerves. To explore the long-term implications of this technique, the right sciatic nerves of Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically cut and reanastomosed either by means of four epineurial sutures or two epineurial sutures and CO2 laser welds. Tensile strength, electrophysiology, histology, and functional studies were performed up to 11 months postoperatively. Tensile strength measurements indicate no long-term disadvantage with the laser-assisted technique, although the short-term tensile strength is lower than with conventional suture repair. The conduction velocities of the repaired nerves were similar for both techniques; however, laser-assisted repaired nerves were found to have lower stimulation thresholds and reduced branching compared to the suture repaired nerves. The measured functional recovery was similar for both repair techniques.\r"

The diametral tensile strength of both types of restorative materials was significantly greater following laser polymerization, as were the transverse flexural strength and the flexural modulus of the microfilled resin restorative material. Additionally, these results were obtained with a laser polymerization time that was one-fourth that used for visible light activation.

  ".U": "90097775\r", 
  ".W": "Serum albumin is one of the most common parameters used in evaluating nutritional status. Three of the popular methods available for measuring serum albumin are serum protein electrophoresis and the two dye binding methods: BCG and BCP. BCG is currently the most popular method because of its simplicity, rapidity, and cost. Although electrophoretic methods are considered more accurate, BCP has shown to correlate well with electrophoresis in most cases. BCG often overestimates serum albumin levels, although its specificity can be improved by minimizing contact time with the serum sample. The average difference between BCG methods and other methods is usually 0.5-0.6 g/dL. From a quantitative standpoint, some might consider the difference in specificity of BCG versus the other two methods to be insignificant; however, from a qualitative standpoint, the difference could easily alter the interpretation of nutritional assessment parameters. Because of differences in analytical methods, serum albumin measurements should be interpreted in the context of the assay being used and the accepted normal range for that laboratory. Likewise, published studies, especially those that stratify degrees of malnutrition and/or risk of complications based on specific serum albumin levels, should specify the assay methodology utilized.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of different treatments for Hodgkin's disease on the risk of leukemia, we used an international collaborative group of cancer registries and hospitals to perform a case-control study of 163 cases of leukemia following treatment for Hodgkin's disease. For each case patient with leukemia, three matched controls were chosen who had been treated for Hodgkin's disease but in whom leukemia did not develop. The use of chemotherapy alone to treat Hodgkin's disease was associated with a relative risk of leukemia of 9.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 20) as compared with the use of radiotherapy alone. Patients treated with both had a relative risk of 7.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 15). After treatment with more than six cycles of combinations including procarbazine and mechlorethamine, the risk of leukemia was 14-fold higher than after radiotherapy alone. The use of radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy did not increase the risk of leukemia above that produced by the use of chemotherapy alone, but there was a dose-related increase in the risk of leukemia in patients who received radiotherapy alone. The peak in the risk of leukemia came about five years after chemotherapy began, and a large excess persisted for at least eight years after it ended. After adjusting for drug regimen, we found that patients who had undergone splenectomy had at least double the risk of leukemia of patients who had not, and an advanced stage of Hodgkin's disease carried a somewhat higher risk of leukemia than Stage I disease. We conclude that chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease greatly increases the risk of leukemia and that this increased risk appears to be dose-related and unaffected by concomitant radiotherapy. In addition, the risk is greater for patients with more advanced stages of Hodgkin's disease and for those who undergo splenectomy.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed the efficacy of an ACTH(4-9) analogue, Org 2766, in the prevention of cisplatin neuropathy in 55 women with ovarian cancer. The analogue was given subcutaneously in a dose of 0.25 mg (low dose) or 1 mg (high dose) per square meter of body-surface area before and after treatment with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide (75 and 750 mg per square meter every three weeks). The threshold of vibration perception was used as the principal measure of neurotoxicity. After four cycles of chemotherapy, the mean (+/- SEM) threshold value for vibration perception in the placebo group increased from 0.67 +/- 0.12 to 1.61 +/- 0.43 microns of skin displacement (P less than 0.0001). In the high-dose treatment group, there was no increase in the threshold value after four cycles (from 0.54 +/- 0.12 to 0.50 +/- 0.06 micron). After six cycles of chemotherapy, the threshold value was 5.87 +/- 1.97 microns in the placebo group (more than an eight-fold increase from base line), as compared with 0.88 +/- 0.17 micron (less than a twofold increase) in the high-dose treatment group (P less than 0.005). In the high-dose group, fewer neurologic signs and symptoms were recorded than in the placebo group. With the lower dose of the analogue, these protective effects were less prominent. No side effects were seen after treatment with Org 2766. The rates of clinical response to chemotherapy were similar in all groups. These results suggest that Org 2766 can prevent or attenuate cisplatin neuropathy without adversely affecting the cytotoxic effect of the drug.\r"

  ".U": "90098027\r", 
  ".W": "To compare ceftriaxone with cefuroxime for the treatment of meningitis, we conducted a study in which 106 children with acute bacterial meningitis were randomly assigned to receive either ceftriaxone (100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, administered intravenously once daily; n = 53) or cefuroxime (240 mg per kilogram per day, administered intravenously in four equal doses; n = 53). The mean age of the children was 3 years (range, 42 days to 16 years), and the characteristics of the two treatment groups were comparable at admission. Excluded from the study were eight other children who died within 48 hours of admission. After 18 to 36 hours of therapy, cultures of cerebrospinal fluid remained positive for 1 of the 52 children (2 percent) receiving ceftriaxone for whom cultures were available and 6 of 52 (12 percent) receiving cefuroxime (P = 0.11). In both groups the mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 10 days. The clinical responses to therapy were similar in the two treatment groups, and all 106 children were cured. Reversible biliary pseudolithiasis was detected by serial abdominal ultrasonography only in the children treated with ceftriaxone (16 of 35 vs. 0 of 35; P less than 0.001). The treatment of three children was switched from ceftriaxone to alternative antibiotics because these children had upper abdominal pain. Other side effects were infrequent in both groups. At follow-up examination two months later, moderate-to-profound hearing loss was present in two children (4 percent) treated with ceftriaxone and in nine (17 percent) treated with cefuroxime (P = 0.05); other neurologic abnormalities were similar in the two treatment groups. We conclude that ceftriaxone is superior to cefuroxime for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis in children and that the benefits of milder hearing impairment and more rapid sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid with ceftriaxone outweigh the problem of reversible biliary pseudolithiasis with this drug.\r"

The prophylactic regimen was a single dose of cefonicid (1 g intravenously) administered approximately half an hour before surgery. The patients were followed up for four to six weeks after surgery. Blinding was maintained until the last patient completed the follow-up and all diagnoses of infection had been made. The patients who received prophylaxis had 48 percent fewer probable or definite infections than those who did not (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio, 0.52; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.84; P = 0.01). For patients undergoing a procedure involving the breast, infection occurred in 6.6 percent of the cefonicid recipients (20 of 303) and 12.2 percent of the placebo recipients (37 of 303); for those undergoing herniorrhaphy, infection occurred in 2.3 percent of the cefonicid recipients (7 of 301) and 4.2 percent of the placebo recipients (13 of 311). There were comparable reductions in the numbers of definite wound infections (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio, 0.49), wounds that drained pus (risk ratio, 0.43), Staphylococcus aureus wound isolates (risk ratio, 0.49), and urinary tract infections (risk ratio, 0.40). There were also comparable reductions in the need for postoperative antibiotic therapy, non-routine visits to a physician for problems involving wound healing, incision and drainage procedures, and readmission because of problems with wound healing. We conclude that perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with cefonicid is useful for herniorrhaphy and certain types of breast surgery.\r"

During 48 months of follow-up, 168 participants (10.1 percent) had a first episode of P. carinii pneumonia. The risk was greatly increased in participants with CD4+ cell counts at base line of 200 per cubic millimeter or less (relative risk, 4.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 8.0). Although most participants (60.7 percent) described no HIV-1-related symptoms at the clinic visit at which a CD4+ cell count of 200 per cubic millimeter or less was first noted, this finding during follow-up was also associated with an increased risk of P. carinii pneumonia. The development of thrush or fever significantly and independently increased the risk of P. carinii pneumonia in these patients (adjusted relative risks, 1.86 and 2.15 for thrush and fever, respectively). Most participants with CD4+ cell counts above 200 per cubic millimeter who had P. carinii pneumonia within six months were symptomatic. We conclude that P. carinii pneumonia is unlikely to develop in HIV-1-infected patients unless their CD4+ cells are depleted to 200 per cubic millimeter or below or the patients are symptomatic, and therefore that prophylaxis should be reserved for such patients.\r"

The subjects were interviewed about HIV risk factors. Coded blood specimens were tested again for HIV-1 antibody (by two different enzyme immunoassays, a Western blot assay and a radioimmunoprecipitation assay) and for HIV-2 antibody by enzyme immunoassay, for HIV-1 by the serum antigen test, for HIV-1 by culture, for human T-cell leukemia virus Type I or II antibody by enzyme immunoassay, and for sequences of HIV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Of the 99 blood donors, 98 reported no risk factors for HIV-1 infection; 1 donor had used intravenous drugs. After a median of 14 months (range, 1 to 30) from the time of the initial test, 65 subjects (66 percent) were still repeatedly reactive for HIV-1 antibody on at least one immunoassay. In 91 subjects (92 percent) the Western blot results were still indeterminate, whereas in 8 they were negative. No donor met the criteria for a positive Western blot assay for HIV-1, and none had evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection on culture or by any other test. We conclude that persons at low risk for HIV infection who have persistent indeterminate HIV-1 Western blots are rarely if ever infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the extent to which the defect in insulin action in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) can be accounted for by impairment of muscle glycogen synthesis, we performed combined hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies with [13C]glucose in five subjects with NIDDM and in six age- and weight-matched healthy subjects. The rate of incorporation of intravenously infused [1-13C]glucose into muscle glycogen was measured directly in the gastrocnemius muscle by means of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with a 15.5-minute time resolution and a 13C surface coil. The steady-state plasma concentrations of insulin (approximately 400 pmol per liter) and glucose (approximately 10 mmol per liter) were similar in both study groups. The mean (+/- SE) rate of glycogen synthesis, as determined by 13C NMR, was 78 +/- 28 and 183 +/- 39 mumol-glucosyl units per kilogram of muscle tissue (wet weight) per minute in the diabetic and normal subjects, respectively (P less than 0.05). The mean glucose uptake was markedly reduced in the diabetic (30 +/- 4 mumol per kilogram per minute) as compared with the normal subjects (51 +/- 3 mumol per kilogram per minute; P less than 0.005). The mean rate of nonoxidative glucose metabolism was 22 +/- 4 mumol per kilogram per minute in the diabetic subjects and 42 +/- 4 mumol per kilogram per minute in the normal subjects (P less than 0.005). When these rates are extrapolated to apply to the whole body, the synthesis of muscle glycogen would account for most of the total-body glucose uptake and all of the nonoxidative glucose metabolism in both normal and diabetic subjects. We conclude that muscle glycogen synthesis is the principal pathway of glucose disposal in both normal and diabetic subjects and that defects in muscle glycogen synthesis have a dominant role in the insulin resistance that occurs in persons with NIDDM.\r"

To investigate the characteristics related to HDL2 cholesterol levels, we measured lipoprotein levels and several metabolic and anthropometric variables in 146 healthy subjects (77 men and 69 women) in the seventh decade of life. The level of HDL2 cholesterol was inversely correlated with the ratio of the waist-to-hip circumference (r = -0.335 for men; r = -0.370 for women; P less than 0.01) and the plasma insulin level (r = -0.400 for men; r = -0.398 for women; P less than 0.001). In a multiple regression model including both sexes, 41 percent of the variance in the HDL2 level was explained by the combined effect of the waist-to-hip ratio (P less than 0.0001), the plasma insulin level (P = 0.0003), and the degree of glucose tolerance indicated by the integrated area under the plasma glucose curve after an oral glucose-tolerance test (P = 0.05). The body-mass index, total percentage of body fat, maximal oxygen uptake, diet, and sex were not significant predictors of the HDL2 level when added to this model, whereas the original variables remained significant predictors. The HDL2 cholesterol level in subjects at the 25th percentile for waist-to-hip ratio was 153 percent of that in subjects at the 75th percentile. We conclude that HDL2 levels are inversely correlated with truncal fat, plasma insulin levels, and the presence of glucose intolerance and are not independently associated with sex or total body fat.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose use in the major target tissues, muscle and fat, by modulating a tissue-specific glucose transporter isoform. Access of glucose to the target tissue is restricted by endothelial cells which line the walls of nonfenestrated capillaries of fat and muscle. Thus, we examined whether the capillary endothelial cells are actively involved in the modulation of glucose availability by these tissues. We report here the abundant expression of the muscle/fat glucose transporter isoform in endothelial cells, using an immunocytochemical analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific for this isoform. This expression is restricted to endothelial cells from the major insulin target tissues, and it is not detected in brain and liver where insulin does not activate glucose transport. The expression of the muscle/fat transporter isoform in endothelial cells is significantly greater than in the neighbouring muscle and fat cells. Following administration of insulin to animals in vivo, there occurs a rapid increase in the number of muscle/fat transporters present in the lumenal plasma membrane of the capillary endothelial cells. These results document that insulin promotes the translocation of the muscle/fat glucose transporter in endothelial cells. It is therefore likely that endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of glucose use by the major insulin target tissues in normal and diseased states.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphocyte function-associated molecule LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) plays a key part in lymphocyte adhesion. Lymphocytes do not adhere spontaneously; activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters, however, gives rise to strong LFA-1-dependent adhesion, indicating that activation of LFA-1 is required to induce cell adhesion. We have now investigated whether the functionally important CD2 and CD3 surface structures on T lymphocytes are involved in the activation of LFA-1. The stimulation of these molecules, which causes activation of PKC, strongly promoted LFA-1-dependent adhesion. Furthermore, we demonstrate by using cells from an LFA-1-deficient patient that this enhanced lymphocyte adhesion is caused by activation of the LFA-1 molecule and not by activation of its ligands. LFA-1 was persistently activated by triggering through CD2 but only transiently by triggering through CD3. We postulate that CD2 and CD3 can differentially regulate the affinity of LFA-1 for its ligands by modulating its molecular conformation through PKC-dependent mechanisms.\r"

Little is known, however, about the degree of conservation of splicing factors other than of the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Yeast counterparts of the metazoan spliceosomal snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) have been identified but, with the exception of U6, the yeast snRNAs are larger and sequence similarity is limited to short regions. By using antibodies against the yeast PRP8 protein, a pre-mRNA splicing factor of relative molecular mass 280,000 (Mr280K) stably associated with U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), we have now identified an immunologically related protein in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The HeLa cell protein has an Mr greater than 200K and is associated with purified 20S U5 snRNPs. This is the first report of phylogenetic conservation between yeast and man of a protein splicing factor.\r"

  ".U": "90098087\r", 
  ".W": "The many different cellular functions so far shown to involve actin and to be regulated by specific actin binding proteins are located primarily, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm. Actin is also found in the nucleus of various cells, but because of the problems of cell fractionation the significance of nuclear actin has remained unclear. The large amphibian oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle), however, can be isolated manually with little cytoplasmic contamination. This nucleus contains high concentrations (4-6 mg ml-1) of mostly soluble, although polymerization-competent beta- and gamma-actin, which exists in a nucleocytoplasmic exchange pool. The findings that drastic effects on transcription and chromosome morphology are caused by the injection of actin antibodies or actin binding proteins into germinal vesicles, and that a factor required for accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II is actin, suggest that nuclear actin is involved in specific nuclear functions. We have recently identified two main components in Xenopus laevis oocytes with actin binding activities; one of these activities is Ca2+-dependent, is located predominantly, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm and is attributable to gelsolin. Here we report that the second component, having a Ca2+-independent activity, is a heterodimeric acting binding protein; this protein is markedly enriched in the nuclei of oocytes and somatic cells of amphibia, but also occurs in nuclei of other vertebrate cells.\r"

A repeated element in the upstream region of HO (the cell-cycle box, CCB) and two regulatory proteins, SW14 and SW16, are required for cell-cycle-dependent expression of HO. Biochemical experiments have identified a factor, CCBF (cell-cycle box factor), that binds to the CCB elements and that presumably plays a key part in cell-cycle regulation of HO. The SW14 and SW16 genes are required for formation of the CCBF-DNA complex. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the SW14 gene and show that it contains two copies of the conserved SW16-cdc10 motif observed in SW16 of budding yeast, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10 gene required for progression through G19, the Drosophila Notch gene, and in the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-12 and glp-1 genes. We demonstrate by using antibodies to the SW14 protein in gel-shift assays that the protein is present in the CCBF-DNA complex.\r"

The symptoms and signs are variable, and the lesions may not appear on routine roentgenographic or computed tomographic examination. A patient with a small epidermoid tumor of Meckel's cave that was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging is herein reported. The epidermoid appeared as a low-intensity mass on the T1-weighted image and as a high-intensity mass on the T2-weighted image. Coronal sections defined the anatomic relationship to the trigeminal nerve. Preoperative recordings of the trigeminal sensory evoked response may be predictive of postoperative recovery of neurological deficits. Furthermore, intraoperative recording was extremely useful in avoiding inadvertent neurological injury. Review of the literature confirms the rarity of this lesion and the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing it, although based on a limited number of cases.\r"

The Australopithecines were not browsers and fruit-eaters with very high intakes of vitamin C; rather they were scavengers of kills made by other animals. The hominids who followed did include some cold-climate hunters of large game, but the amount of animal protein decreased with the advent of grain-gathering and decreased further with the introduction of cereal agriculture, with a concomitant decrease in body size. From what we know about food adequacy, preparation, and storage, the notion that the postulated \"primitive\" diet was generally adequate, safe, and prudent can be rejected. Over evolutionary time, many of our ancestors ate poorly, especially during climate extremes, and they were often at risk for vitamin deficiencies, food-borne diseases, and neurotoxins. Until the advent of modern processing technologies, dirt, grit, and fiber constituted a large part of most early diets.\r"

Four patients with diversion colitis, an inflammatory process in surgically excluded colon and rectum, were successfully treated by colonic instillation of a solution of mixed SCFA.

  ".U": "90098572\r", 
  ".W": "Head injury frequently results in headache and at times facial pain. Controversy concerns the relationship of injury in the head and neck area to chronic headache, particularly when no apparent structural traumatic lesion is demonstrable. Neuropathological studies suggest with concussion there is neuronal injury without gross pathology. Closed head injury of seemingly minor degrees may lead to chronic symptoms, often stereotypic, similar to those following concussion, and they have been described by the term post head trauma syndrome or postconcussional syndrome. Headache after head injury in an individual warrants careful medical, neurological, and neuroimaging assessment. The use of neuroimaging has greatly enhanced diagnosis in head-injured patients but has not satisfactorily clarified post head trauma symptoms in the less severely traumatized. Differential diagnosis is critical to avoid missing disabling, progressive, and life-threatening entities. In patients with head trauma neck injury should be sought. The headache may be nonspecific or mimic common nontraumatic headache disorders such as tension, migraine, and cluster. Recovery may include headache, psychological symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Neuropsychological assessment can be helpful in demonstrating deficiencies in mildly impaired individuals and explain the poor response to headache therapy in some patients suggesting more widespread injury. Therapy of head and facial pain follows the careful diagnosis and, if needed, assessment of the psychological status. Surgery, drug therapy, physical modalities, and at times a comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation program are necessary. Simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for short-term treatment and tricyclic antidepressants for chronic pain are most often effective in patients without structural damage. More complex medication regimens may include beta adrenergic blockers and monamine oxidase inhibitors. Since many injuries result from motor vehicle accidents, work-related factors, and other instances in which litigation may result, legal elements may be involved. Most often the prognosis is favorable for resolution of symptoms but a small percentage of patients will have persistent symptoms after three years. The notion that litigation prolongs the duration of the illness is not valid. In the past two decades great advances have been made in neurodiagnosis, and parallel therapeutic advances are expected in the near future.\r"

The prime role of the practitioner is to accurately identify and quantify a poisoning exposure, to institute appropriate initial stabilization and management, and to recognize individuals who require further treatment and transfer to hospital settings. Beyond the obvious importance of initial stabilization of severely poisoned patients, the most important step in approaching the acute overdose is to identify what was taken, how much was taken, and when it was taken. To ensure appropriate treatment, the practitioner must use all the resources possible to obtain accurate identification and quantification of these exposures. Nontoxic exposures judged by the product (see Table 5) or by the quantity ingested (see Table 4) may safely be discharged with follow-up care. With toxic exposures, all attempts must focus on terminating the exposure by gastrointestinal decontamination with oral poisonings, adequate aeration with inhalational poisonings, and copious washing with topical and/or ocular exposures. The skillful approach of the office practitioner will provide the most effective initial management of the poisoned child. Appropriate referral to an emergency department for further evaluation and treatment may then be considered.\r"

  ".U": "90099284\r", 
  ".W": "Antisense RNA is a potentially powerful tool for creating dominant negative mutations, but one of the limitations of this strategy has been the relative inefficiency of antisense transcripts in blocking target gene expression. To identify more effective target sequences, helper-free retrovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to introduce antisense RNAs complementary to multiple functional regions of the human creatine kinase B (CK-B) mRNA into U937 cells. Antisense RNA complementary to the last third of the coding and all of the noncoding regio of this mRNA is highly effective; one or two antisense transcripts is sufficient to block the expression of one CK-B mRNA. In contrast, antisense RNA from which sequences complementary to the last 17 codons and all the 3' noncoding region have been deleted has no effect on CK-B expression. Neither antisense RNA alters the abundance of the target message, processing of the primary transcript, egress of the CK-B message from the nucleus, or the polysome profile of CK-B mRNA in sucrose gradients. These results point to a direct effect of the antisense transcript on translation and suggest that this effect may be explained at least in part by an inhibition of elongation or termination as a consequence of the duplex formed in the distal coding and/or 3' noncoding region.\r"

  ".U": "90099295\r", 
  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus and the C3d fragment of the third component of complement are specific extracellular ligands for complement receptor type 2 (CR2). However, intracellular proteins that react specifically with CR2 and are involved in post-membrane signals remain unknown. We recently prepared polyclonal anti-idiotypic anti-CR2 antibodies (Ab2) by using the highly purified CR2 molecule as original immunogen. We showed that Ab2 contained anti-idiotypic specificities that mimicked extracellular domains of CR2 and detected two distinct binding sites on CR2 for its specific extracellular ligands, Epstein-Barr virus and C3d. We postulated that Ab2 might also contain specificities that could mimic intracellular domains of CR2. Here we report that Ab2, which did not react with Raji B-lymphoma cell surface components, detected specifically, among all components solubilized from Raji cell membranes, a single intracellular membrane protein of apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa. This protein was identified as the p53 cellular antioncogene-encoded membrane phosphoprotein by analyzing its antigenic properties with Pab1801, a monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, and by comparing its biochemical properties with those of p53. Additionally, solubilized and purified CR2 bound to solubilized p53 immobilized on Pab1801-Sepharose. p53, like CR2, was localized only in purified plasma membranes and nuclei of Raji cells. These data suggest strongly that p53, a cellular antioncogene-encoded phosphoprotein, reacted specifically with CR2 in Raji membranes. This interaction may represent one of the important steps through which CR2 could be involved in human B-lymphocyte proliferation and transformation.\r"

  ".W": "Overexpression of c-raf-1 and the myc family of protooncogenes is primarily associated with small cell carcinoma, which accounts for approximately 25% of human lung cancer. To determine the functional significance of the c-raf-1 and/or c-myc gene expression in lung carcinogenesis and to delineate the relationship between protooncogene expression and tumor phenotype, we introduced both protooncogenes, alone or in combination, into human bronchial epithelial cells. Two retroviral recombinants, pZip-raf and pZip-myc, containing the complete coding sequences of the human c-raf-1 and murine c-myc genes, respectively, were constructed and transfected into simian virus 40 large tumor antigen-immortalized bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B); this was followed by selection for G418 resistance. BEAS-2B cells expressing both the transfected c-raf-1 and c-myc sequences formed large cell carcinomas in athymic nude mice with a latency of 4-21 weeks, whereas either pZip-raf- or pZip-myc-transfected cells were nontumorigenic after 12 months. Cell lines established from tumors (designated RMT) revealed the presence of the cotransfected c-raf-1 and c-myc sequences and expressed morphological, chromosomal, and isoenzyme markers, which identified BEAS-2B cells as the progenitor line of the tumors. A significant increase in the mRNA levels of neuron-specific enolase was detected in BEAS-2B cells containing both the c-raf-1 and c-myc genes and derived tumor cell lines. The data demonstrate that the concomitant expression of the c-raf and c-myc protooncogenes causes neoplastic transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells resulting in large cell carcinomas with certain neuroendocrine markers. The presented model system should be useful in studies of molecular events involved in multistage lung carcinogenesis.\r"

This treatment is most effective when applied shortly after the clinical manifestation of arthritis--i.e., 4-7 weeks after administration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Transplantation of bone marrow at a later stage results in a limited recovery, in that the inflammatory reaction regresses but the newly formed excessive bone is not eliminated. Local irradiation of the affected joints had no effect on the disease. It could also be excluded that the recovery of arthritis following marrow transplantation is due to lack of available antigen. Transplantation of syngeneic bone marrow is as effective as that of allogeneic bone marrow from a rat strain that is not susceptible to induction of adjuvant arthritis. The beneficial effect of this treatment cannot be ascribed to the immunosuppressive effect of total body irradiation, since treatment with the highly immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporin A resulted in a regression of the joint swelling but relapse occurred shortly after discontinuation of the treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the entire coding region of canine factor IX from a hemophilia B animal. When the sequence was compared to that which codes for normal canine factor IX, a single missense mutation was identified. This mutation (G----A at nucleotide 1477) results in the substitution of glutamic acid for glycine-379 in the catalytic domain of the molecule. The mutation creates a new restriction site that allowed confirmation of the abnormal sequence in both hemophilic and carrier animals. Amino acid 379 in canine factor IX corresponds to position 381 in human factor IX, a location at which no human mutations have been described. Moreover, it occurs at one of the few amino acids that have been rigorously conserved among the trypsin-like serine proteases throughout evolution. The mutation responsible for canine hemophilia B results in a complete lack of circulating factor IX in the affected animals. As it is unusual for a missense mutation to result in a complete absence of protein product, structural modeling of the mutant and normal proteins was pursued. These studies suggest that the observed mutation would have major adverse effects on the tertiary structure of the aberrant factor IX molecule. The elucidation of this mutation sheds light on structure-function relationships in factor IX and should facilitate future experiments directed toward gene therapy of this disease.\r"

We present evidence that the kinase and bisphosphatase halves of the bifunctional enzyme are, respectively, structurally similar to the glycolytic enzymes 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and phosphoglycerate mutase. Computer-assisted modeling of the C-terminal bisphosphatase domain reveals a hydrophobic core and active site residue constellation equivalent to the yeast mutase structure; structural differences map to length-variable, surface-located loops. Sequence patterns derived from the structural alignment of mutases and the bisphosphatase further detect a significant similarity to a family of acid phosphatases. The N-terminal kinase domain, in turn, is predicted to form a nucleotide-binding fold that is analogous to a segment of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, suggesting that these unrelated enzymes bind fructose 6-phosphate and ATP substrates in a similar geometry. This analysis indicates that the bifunctional enzyme is the likely product of gene fusion of kinase and mutase/phosphatase catalytic units.\r"

One such tick gut glycoprotein, designated Bm86, has been purified to homogeneity and the amino acid sequences of peptide fragments generated by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion have been determined. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA that encodes Bm86. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA contains a 1982-base-pair open reading frame and predicts that Bm86 contains 650 amino acids including a 19-amino acid signal sequence and a 23-amino acid hydrophobic region adjacent to the carboxyl terminus. The main feature of the deduced protein sequence is the repeated pattern of 6 cysteine residues, suggesting the presence of several epidermal growth factor-like domains. A fusion protein consisting of 599 amino acids of Bm86 and 651 amino acids of beta-galactosidase was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Ticks engorging on cattle vaccinated with these inclusion bodies were significantly damaged as a result of the immune response against the cloned antigen.\r"

  ".U": "90099324\r", 
  ".W": "The 37-amino acid peptide called amylin is a major component of the islet amyloid deposited in the pancreases of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We report the isolation of a partial cDNA clone and a phage lambda genomic clone of the coding region of the amylin gene. The DNA sequence encodes a protein sequence identical to that of amylin isolated from the amyloid found in the diabetic pancreas and shows that amylin is likely to be synthesized as a precursor peptide, now named proamylin. We have demonstrated that the amylin gene is present on chromosome 12 and that it is probably transcribed in the islets of Langerhans. The sequences of the genes for amylin and the calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) show strong similarity, especially over their 5' coding regions, where both peptides have a conserved intramolecular disulfide bridge, and also over their 3' coding regions, where the presence of a glycine codon strongly suggests that the carboxyl-terminal residue of amylin, like that of CGRP, is amidated. To examine the functional relevance of these posttranslational modifications, the biological activity of amylin synthesized with or without the disulfide bridge and/or amidation was measured. It was found that both features are necessary for full biological activity, thereby confirming the functional importance of those regions of the molecule whose sequences are conserved at both protein and genetic levels.\r"

This DNA sequence element has a large purine-pyrimidine strand asymmetry and can assume the H-DNA conformation. A factor with the properties of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interacts with this DNA region. The interaction of the c-myc DNA sequence element and the RNP involves an RNase H-sensitive mechanism and, therefore, may involve an RNA.DNA hybrid. In addition, a protein factor(s) binds to this DNA sequence element. DNA footprinting and mutant oligonucleotide binding/competition assays implicate a punctate, poly(G.C) recognition/binding sequence for the RNP factor, whereas the major protein factor requires two ACCCT sequence motifs for maximal binding. These results suggest that RNP and protein factors act as positive transcriptional regulators of the c-myc gene, perhaps by altering DNA topology.\r"

The synthetic internal standard RNA consists of a linear array of the sequences of upstream primers of multiple target genes followed by the complementary sequences to their downstream primers in the same order. This quantitative PCR method provides a rapid and reliable way to quantify the amount of a specific mRNA in a sample of less than 0.1 ng of total RNA.

Whereas haploid strains carrying the mutant allele, designated cam1-F116, exhibit no defects in growth and mating, diploid strains homozygous for cam1-F116 are deficient in sporulation. The four nuclei generated by the two serial meiotic divisions are not encapsulated in these diploids. The mutation is recessive. Semiquantitative analysis using polyclonal antibodies showed that vegetatively growing cam1-F116 cells have a smaller amount of calmodulin than wild-type cells. The quantitative difference becomes more remarkable if the cells are starved for nitrogen, which is a condition for induction of sporulation. In addition to this in vivo observation, we showed in vitro that the mutant protein is susceptible to a proteolytic activity induced by nitrogen starvation that hardly affects the wild-type calmodulin. Thus, the sporulation deficiency of the cam1-F116 mutant may be ascribed to shortage of calmodulin due to proteolysis of the mutant molecules under nitrogen starvation. Two other mutations at position 116 resulted in similar but leakier Spo- phenotypes.\r"

These mimics included an analogue of statine, hydroxyethylene isosteres, two categories of phosphinic acids, a reduced amide isostere, and an alpha,alpha-difluoroketone. The resulting peptide analogues were linear competitive inhibitors of purified recombinant HIV-1 protease with inhibition constants ranging from 18 nM to 40 microM depending on the type of inhibitor. A truncated inhibitor, an analogue of a hexapeptide, retained full inhibitory potency. The most potent inhibitors, containing the hydroxyethylene isostere, effectively blocked the proteolytic processing of a recombinant form of Pr55gag by HIV-1 protease in a cell-free assay.\r"

With the experimental conditions used, the sensitivity of the technique is such that TK mRNA can be detected in as few as 20 S-phase cells. TK hnRNA is maximally expressed early in the S phase of the cell cycle after quiescent human fibroblasts are stimulated to proliferate. At this point, the ratio of TK hnRNA to TK mRNA is 1:155. A small amount of TK hnRNA can be detected in populations of cells that appear to be quiescent. However, the presence of the precursor in these populations correlates with the number of cells still cycling. No TK hnRNA can be detected in truly quiescent human diploid fibroblasts, suggesting that in these cells, the TK gene is not transcribed in G0.\r"

Substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at nine other sites in the protein has no apparent effect on enzyme activity. Amino acid sequence alignment reveals Tyr-274 to be homologous to Tyr-727 and Tyr-771, respectively, of the type I topoisomerases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pombe; Tyr-727 and Tyr-771 have been shown to represent the active-site tyrosines of those enzymes.

Gel filtration indicated a molecular mass of 28 +/- 5 kDa under nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that the native BTF1Y protein is a monomer. BTF1Y was enzymatically cleaved, several peptides were sequenced, and appropriate oligonucleotide probes were synthesized to clone the BTF1Y gene from a yeast genomic library. The BTF1Y gene contains a 720-base-pair open reading frame encoding a protein of 27,003 Da. The recombinant protein expressed in HeLa cells exhibited the same chromatographic characteristics and in vitro transcriptional activity as BTF1Y prepared from yeast extracts, confirming the identity of the gene.

For the tryptophans three relaxation processes and for the pyrene two relaxation processes with relaxation times in the nanosecond range were observed. The slowest process, of approximately 50 ns, is assigned to orientational fluctuations of membrane-spanning helices. When the temperature is decreased below the lipid-phase transition, this relaxation process is slowed down and restricted in amplitude. Because the transport rate is known to also decrease below the phase transition, this observation suggests a coupling between internal dynamics and transport. This coupling is analyzed on the basis of the Kramers relation for chemical reactions.\r"

There is significant current interest in structure-function relationships in EGF and EGF-like proteins, including the homologous type-alpha transforming growth factors. The Leu-47 residue of murine EGF (mEGF) is one of several that are strongly conserved among the EGF-like growth factors, suggesting that it may contribute to the active site of mEGF. In several different binding assays, the activity of the mutant analog in which Leu-47 is replaced by Ser [( Ser47]mEGF) ranges from 8 to 18 times weaker than that of wild-type mEGF. The NMR data summarized in this paper demonstrate that the significant differences in the binding activities of wild-type and [Ser47]mEGF cannot be attributed to structural changes remote from the three-dimensional site of mutation. The only minor conformational changes that are indicated by these data involve side chains of residues proximal to Leu-47 in the three-dimensional structure. Therefore, Leu-47 and/or residues spatially adjacent to Leu-47 constitute part of the active site of mEGF.\r"

  ".W": "The RAD6 gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) required for a variety of cellular processes including DNA repair, induced mutagenesis, and sporulation. Here we identify an E2 from a higher plant, wheat, that is similar to RAD6 with respect to both structure and in vitro substrate specificity. The protein was purified from wheat germ by a combination of ubiquitin covalent affinity chromatography and anion-exchange HPLC and has an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa [referred to as E2(23 kDa)]. E2(23 kDa) was capable of binding ubiquitin by means of a thiol ester linkage in an ATP-dependent and ubiquitin-activating enzyme-dependent reaction. In the presence of a variety of target proteins, E2(23 kDa), like the RAD6 gene product, formed covalent ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro only with histones in a ubiquitin protein ligase-independent reaction. E2(23 kDa) recognized both core and linker histones with an apparent order of preference of H2A greater than or equal to H1 greater than H2B greater than H3 greater than H4. This E2 protein was approximately 17-fold more effective at conjugating ubiquitin to histones than three other purified wheat germ E2 proteins tested. Mouse anti-E2(23 kDa) antibodies were used to isolate E2(23 kDa) DNA sequences from a wheat cDNA expression library. Antibody-positive clones were confirmed by amino acid identity of the sequence deduced from the cDNA to the peptide sequence of an E2(23 kDa) tryptic fragment. Protein expressed in Escherichia coli by the E2(23 kDa) cDNA was capable of both thiol ester adduct formation and conjugation of ubiquitin to histones. Analysis of the E2(23 kDa) cDNA shows that it encodes a protein with considerable amino acid sequence similarity to the yeast RAD6 gene product. Similarities exist at the amino terminus, the region surrounding the putative ubiquitin binding site, and at the carboxyl terminus, which is unusually acidic. Based on both the structural and enzymatic similarities to the RAD6 gene product, E2(23 kDa) may represent the first DNA repair enzyme identified in higher plants.\r"

Upon warming the cells to 37 degrees C, part of the glycolipid analog was internalized. A comparison with receptor-mediated uptake of transferrin revealed that after 2 min of warming, both C6-NBD-glucosylceramide and the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex are localized in the same intracellular compartment (early endosomes). We conclude that C6-NBD-glucosylceramide is internalized along the pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis. When, after internalization of part of the membrane-inserted glycolipid analog, the residual pool of plasma membrane C6-NBD-lipid was removed by \"back exchange\" with a lipid acceptor, C6-NBD-glucosylceramide molecules can be shown to return intact to the plasma membrane.

This discrepancy results from the presence of O-linked mannose oligosaccharides attached to the clustered serines and threonines at the amino terminus of the protein. The addition of mannose is completely abolished in the early secretory mutant sec53, attenuated in the late-endoplasmic reticulum-blocked sec18, and unaffected in sec7, which is blocked late in the Golgi phase of secretion.

J3V1 contains an additional deletion of 334 base paris in gag, which restores the correct reading frame for v-raf and results in the expression of a p57 gag-raf fusion protein. Reactivation of v-raf in J3 is required for efficient plasmacytoma acceleration in pristane-conditioned BALB/cAn mice.\r"

  ".W": "Okadaic acid is a non-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-type tumor promoter on mouse skin and known to be a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Contrary to expectation from its tumor-promoting activity, okadaic acid was shown to have a potential to revert the phenotypes of cells transformed by raf and ret-II to that of normal cells. Two to 3 days after addition of 8 ng of okadaic acid per ml to the culture medium, raf and ret-II transformants changed to flat cells and gained contact inhibition. The amount of fibronectin, which was decreased in malignant transformed cells, was increased in the flat revertants. Moreover, okadaic acid caused a dose-dependent loss of ability to grow in soft agar. The morphology of the cells reverted to malignant phenotype within 1 week after removal of okadaic acid. The levels of mRNA and protein of activated c-raf in flat revertants were similar to those in parental transformed cells. The level of mRNA of ret-II was also not changed by flat reversion. No induction of flat reversion was observed with okadaic acid tetramethyl ether, an inactive compound, or a phorbol ester, PMA. As okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, the possibility that these phosphatases are involved in signal transduction from the raf and ret-II oncogenes is suggested.\r"

Multiple consecutive amino acids in three alpha-helices in the alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) of Escherichia coli have been replaced with helical sequences from four other sources. Altogether, 12 distinct helical replacements were created, 9 of which retain enzymatic activity. Most short stretches of helical sequence can be replaced with unrelated helical sequences without eliminating enzyme activity. Replacements of the carboxyl half of an alpha-helix are less harmful than those of the amino half, and the two together are synergistic rather than additive. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proteins originally evolved by the assembly of small functional folding units.\r"

  ".W": "Genes CDC24, CDC42, and CDC43 are required for the establishment of cell polarity and the localization of secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; mutants defective in these genes fail to form buds and display isotropic expansion of the cell surface. To identify other genes that may be involved in these processes, we screened yeast genomic DNA libraries for heterologous genes that, when overexpressed from a plasmid, can suppress a temperature-sensitive cdc24 mutation. We identified four such genes. One of these proved to be CDC42, which has previously been shown to be a member of the rho (ras-homologous) family of genes, and a second is a newly identified ras-related gene that we named RSR1. RSR1 maps between CDC62 and ADE3 on the right arm of chromosome VII; its predicted product is approximately 50% identical to other proteins in the ras family. Deletion of RSR1 is nonlethal but disrupts the normal pattern of bud site selection. Although both CDC42 and RSR1 can suppress cdc24 and both appear to encode GTP-binding proteins, these genes do not themselves appear to be functionally interchangeable. However, one of the other genes that was isolated by virtue of its ability to suppress cdc24 can also suppress cdc42. This gene, named MSB1, maps between ADE9 and HIS3 on the right arm of chromosome XV.\r"

The DNA sources used were hybrid cell line WAV-17, containing chromosome 21 as the only human chromosome and flow-sorted chromosome 21. The transformation efficiency of ligation products was similar to that obtained in aqueous transformations and yielded YACs with sizes ranging from 100 kilobases (kb) to greater than 1 megabase when polyamines were included in the transformation procedure. Twenty-five YACs containing human DNA have been obtained from a mouse-human hybrid, ranging in size from 200 to greater than 1000 kb, with an average size of 410 kb. Ten of these YACs were localized to subregions of chromosome 21 by hybridization of RNA probes (corresponding to the YAC ends recovered in Escherichia coli) to a panel of somatic cell hybrid DNA. Twenty-one human YACs, ranging in size from 100 to 500 kb, with an average size of 150 kb, were obtained from approximately equal to 50 ng of flow-sorted chromosome 21 DNA. Three were localized to subregions of chromosome 21. YACs will aid the construction of a physical map of human chromosome 21 and the study of disorders associated with chromosome 21 such as Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome.\r"

However the quantification of respiratory muscle 'fatigue' has proved more difficult, and it is now recognized that there is unlikely to be one single index of fatigue, rather a whole sequence of changes that occur in response to loading. It is likely that in practice, a close interplay between respiratory pump capacity, demands on the pump and more especially, adaptive changes in respiratory drive, protect the respiratory muscles from overt peripheral contractile failure, and that the fall in tension following prolonged muscular activity involves many different closely inter-related processes. Investigation of these processes is likely to be more rewarding than attempts to develop a single 'test of fatigue', and may lead to an improved understanding of the role of respiratory muscle dysfunction in ventilatory failure.\r"

A method was devised for the measurement of depth of coma in children too young to speak. Twenty patients (15 per cent) died and 12 (9 per cent) recovered with residual neurological sequelae. Presenting clinical signs significantly associated with adverse outcome (death or sequelae) were profound coma, signs of decerebration, absence of corneal reflexes, convulsions at the time of admission and age under three years. Laboratory findings of prognostic significance were hypoglycaemia, leucocytosis, hyperparasitaemia, elevated plasma concentrations of alanine and 5'-nucleotidase, and elevated plasma or cerebrospinal fluid lactate. A prognostic index based on eight of these risk factors that can readily be ascertained at the bedside or in a ward sideroom, was more accurately predictive of outcome than any single feature. Such an index may be valuable as a measure of severity of illness for establishing the comparability of study groups, and for evaluating the role of other factors in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.\r"

The use of direct scaling techniques has enabled researching into mechanisms of breathlessness in recent years, resulting in an increased understanding of the sensation, but no significant therapeutic advances as yet. An area of current research interest is study of the different descriptors for the sensation used by different subjects. This may have great practical importance because it may be that, as with pain, different types of breathlessness will respond to different types of treatment.\r"

The mean estimated volume blood flow (+/- standard deviation) was 43 mL/kg/min +/- 13 and did not depend on differences in body weight. The authors also assessed blood flow velocity in the SMA and volume blood flow in 18 infants with conditions that may affect blood supply to the bowel. Twelve infants who were small for gestational age appeared to have an abnormally low resistance of the vascular bed of the SMA during the 1st days of life, as compared with stable appropriate-for-gestational-age infants matched for gestational age. Three of six term neonates with cardiovascular abnormalities had left ventricular outflow obstruction and an abnormal blood flow velocity waveform of the SMA, suggesting a decrease in blood supply to the bowel. The results of this study may help in evaluations of intestinal perfusion in infants with abnormal conditions.\r"

Hematologic, blood chemistry, and urinary evaluations showed no apparent drug-related effects, with the exception of a transient, asymptomatic rise in serum iron and bilirubin levels in some patients. Other safety assessments--electrocardiography, electroencephalography, neurologic examinations, and vital signs--showed no clinically significant trends in change from baseline results.

Major complications occurred in six of these 77 cases (8%). One hundred four biopsies were performed by using a smaller 18-gauge cutting needle with a spring-loaded biopsy \"gun\" and real-time US guidance. With this newer technique, specimens adequate for diagnosis were obtained in 99 biopsies (95%). There was a single major complication with this technique (1%). The 18-gauge needle with real-time US guidance yields comparably adequate specimens with a lower frequency of complications.\r"

In 10 consecutive healthy subjects, a mirror image of the subclavian artery was readily apparent at gray-scale, spectral Doppler, and color Doppler sonography. An experimental in vitro model was constructed to demonstrate that the lung apex, which is located immediately posterior to the subclavian artery, acts as the highly reflective acoustic interface to form this artifact. Knowledge of the presence of the mirror-image artifact should be helpful to the radiologist and sonographer in avoiding misinterpretation of this important pitfall in both spectral and color Doppler flow imaging of the subclavian region, where there is a plethora of branching vessels.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus, originally sensitive to penicillin in 1942, demonstrated, more than other susceptible bacteria, a capacity for the development of antibiotic resistance. Hospital personnel became carriers of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci that contaminated newborn infants and hospitalized children and adults, who then became carriers and suffered an increasing incidence of suppurative disease. Asymptomatic carriers of antibiotic-resistant epidemic strains spread them into communities, with resulting infection of others. Newer antibiotics were developed, only to lose effectiveness as the staphylococci developed resistance. Local, national, and international programs emerged for the development of epidemiologic research, hospital surveillance, and education in methods of prevention and control. Carrier rates of S. aureus among hospital personnel remained approximately 33%, while the incidence of nosocomial staphylococcal infections declined. Staphylococcal pandemics may be cyclic in occurrence.\r"

The development of immunity against an antigen at one mucosal surface may lead to the appearance of that immunity at other mucosal surfaces. In order to attain good protective immunity against a bacterial enteropathogen, it may be necessary to induce such immunity through the mucosal immune system of the gut. Earlier attempts to elicit protective immunity against bacterial enteropathogens by parenteral vaccination are reviewed. The modern approach involves oral administration of antigen. Such antigen may consist of killed bacteria or--more effectively--live, attenuated bacteria bearing antigens of interest. Such bacteria may be enteropathogens attenuated by mutation, either general or site-directed, or hybrid strains in which a bacterial carrier expresses an antigenic determinant of interest from cloned DNA. While good progress has been made in the comprehension of the requirements for effective vaccination against enteropathogenic bacteria, future work will produce more effective carrier strains than are currently available.\r"

Of a total of 21 cases of CNS infections caused by P. boydii (one described for the first time and 20 reported previously in the English-language literature), eight occurred in immunosuppressed patients and four in patients who nearly drowned; three were trauma related and two were iatrogenic (epidural anesthesia and ventriculoperitoneal shunt, respectively); one occurred in a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and three, in patients without underlying disease or predisposing conditions. The clinical manifestations included brain abscesses (13 cases), spinal pachymeningitis (two cases), chronic meningitis (two cases), intraventricular device-related ventriculitis (two cases), cranial epidural abscess (one case), and acute meningitis (one case). Seven patients showed clinical evidence of extraneural involvement by P. boydii. The outcome is known for 20 patients. Of these, the diagnosis was established while the patient was alive in 18 cases, in spite of which, 15 patients died. All five survivors were managed surgically, and two received intravenous miconazole. P. boydii should be included in the differential diagnosis of CNS infections that occur in the face of immunosuppression, near drowning, and trauma. Occasionally P. boydii can cause CNS infection in the absence of underlying disease or predisposing conditions.\r"

This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical understanding of this disease. Immunosuppressive therapy and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus are recognized risk factors for the development of severe, progressive disease. Although relatively uncommon, extrapulmonary dissemination of Coccidioides immitis can lead to chronic infection of the skin, bones, and meninges. Culture and histologic examination are important in establishment of the diagnosis, but serologic tests remain both diagnostically and prognostically useful. Treatment is problematic. Coccidioidomycosis is an unpredictable disease, and assessments of drug efficacy are difficult. Ketoconazole is challenging amphotericin B as the preferred treatment for some manifestations. However, many of the adverse effects of ketoconazole have only recently been recognized. Newer antifungal agents, such as fluconazole and itraconazole, hold promise for the future.\r"

Whether recent sporadic outbreaks of rheumatic fever due to known rheumatogenic strains of group A streptococci will have a significant effect on morbidity and mortality trends remains to be seen. Relatively high rates of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in developing countries are difficult to evaluate because of irregularities in reporting and investigative procedures.\r"

The rate was not increased in patients given a daily dose of less than 10 mg or a cumulative dose of less than 700 mg of prednisone. With increasing doses the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increased in patients given corticosteroids as well as in patients given placebo, a finding suggesting that not only the corticosteroid but also the underlying disease state account for the steroid-associated infectious complications observed in clinical practice.\r"

Shortly after the renal allograft was removed because of chronic rejection, the patient developed dyspnea and a decrease in vitality. He had no history of preexisting lung disease. A chest roentgenogram showed multiple nodular infiltrates in both lungs. M. xenopi was cultured from three sputum samples. The organism was susceptible to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide. The patient was treated successfully with isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampin for 3 months and with isoniazid in combination with rifampin for an additional 9 months, while he was maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).

  ".W": "In November 1906, Richard Pearson Strong, then head of the Philippine Biological Laboratory, inoculated 24 men--inmates of Manila's Bilibid Prison--with a cholera vaccine that somehow had been contaminated with plague organisms; 13 men died. The governor-general of the Philippines appointed a general committee to investigate the affair, and the U.S. Senate demanded information about the episode. Although the Senate, the secretary of war, and even the president were kept informed of developments, no mainland investigations ensued. The general committee concluded that Strong was negligent for not having locks on his incubators and for leaving a visiting physician alone in the laboratory, where he might have mixed up the cholera and plague cultures on the fateful day. The committee's charge was referred to the attorney general, who found Strong innocent of criminal negligence, whereupon the governor-general exonerated Strong. Strong was despondent over Bilibid but recovered and developed a noteworthy career in American tropical medicine. In retrospect, the disaster at Bilibid presents an epitome of the problems surrounding the use of prisoner-subjects without authorization and without their voluntary consent. Far ahead of its time, the general committee recognized and condemned the shortcomings and urged reform, pleas the government ignored. The Bilibid episode remains, however, as a cautionary tale for those engaged in clinical research.\r"

PMNs interact through cytokines with a number of cell types, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. PMNs are guided by bacterial products and cytokines to target sites, where microbes are recognized and killed. Killing occurs through oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms. The frequent and severe infections seen in patients with defects (either congenital or acquired) in PMN function demonstrate the importance of PMNs in host defense against infection. PMNs are potent inflammatory cells and can exacerbate disease states such as myocardial ischemia, gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and the adult respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Some anticore antibodies can bind to lipid A and have a neutralizing, but not opsonic, activity; these antibodies are usually IgM. IgG antibodies to outer core regions may be weakly opsonic. The outcome of animal protection studies is critically dependent on the choice of challenge organism, dose, timing and rate of antibody administration, and additional factors such as antimicrobial therapy. Protective activity against a wide variety of gram-negative bacillary challenges with the IgM anticore and lipid A reactive antibody, which we have designated E5, is reviewed. Protection in a therapeutic model is demonstrable when the antibody is used in conjunction with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This antibody is now being assessed in clinical trials. Optimal use of monoclonal antibodies may involve a \"cocktail\" of antibodies with complementary binding specificities.\r"

  ".W": "The specific composition of empiric antibiotic therapy to be implemented for patients with neutropenia and fever remains controversial. The available clinical data comparing antibiotic combination with monotherapy come from studies with a number of major differences in design and analysis that make it difficult to interpret relative efficacy. The standard practice has been to use an antibiotic combination demonstrating broad antibacterial coverage, additive or synergistic effects against the more virulent gram-negative pathogens, and potentially antibacterial activity that decreases the emergence of resistant organisms. Studies of monotherapy have been hindered by wide differences in study design, and few comparative data have been presented to substantiate the efficacy of the drug in question as \"treatment of infection\"--an exception being the new agent imipenem. The emergence of gram-positive organisms as frequent pathogens in neutropenic patients has raised concern regarding empiric gram-positive therapy. Clinical experience suggests that empiric therapy is unnecessary; rather, directed therapy with an agent such as vancomycin can be used in those situations in which clinical or microbiologic data suggest the need for such antibiotics. If the specifics of optimal management of infectious disease in patients with sustained neutropenia and fever are to be identified, many continuing clinical problems must be approached in a more systematic and defined manner. Defects in study designs of the past should be eliminated, with investigators taking a stronger stand in support of standardized design and analysis.\r"

Combinations of an aminoglycoside plus a broad-spectrum beta-lactam agent have been used most extensively, producing response rates of 65%-70% at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. We found that in neutropenic patients aminoglycosides alone were not effective, even against infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacilli. Among patients with neutrophil counts of less than 100/mm3, only approximately 25% responded. The first studies of combinations of a penicillin plus a cephalosporin were initiated at this institution. Carbenicillin plus cephalothin was as effective as carbenicillin plus kanamycin (57% vs. 56%), and moxalactam plus ticarcillin was as effective as moxalactam plus tobramycin (63% vs. 53%). Monotherapy with broad-spectrum beta-lactam agents has also been effective, even for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections, with response rates of 73%-100%. Recent prospective, randomized trials indicate that agents such as ceftazidime and aztreonam are as effective alone as in combination with an aminoglycoside or another beta-lactam antibiotic. Because of the changing spectrum of infecting organisms, of new approaches to therapy for malignant diseases that alter patients' susceptibility to infection, and of the availability of new antimicrobial agents, antibiotic therapy for fever in neutropenic patients will continue to be a subject for clinical investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Opportunistic fungal infections are now common and will become more common as a consequence of the use of various regimens of immunosuppressive therapy for a variety of diseases and because of AIDS. These infections can be broadly divided into those that take advantage of a neutrophil defect (e.g., candidiasis, aspergillosis, and mucormycosis) and those that take advantage of a T cell mononuclear phagocyte defect (e.g., cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis). Problems in diagnosis have been apparent since these infections were first recognized. The usual clinical specimens are often not revealing, and attempts to develop special serologic and biochemical tests have been made for years, but progress has been slow. Problems in treatment stem first from a lack of an early diagnosis and second from a lack of drugs that are effective and relatively nontoxic. It is difficult to evaluate new drugs if we cannot make accurate diagnoses; this difficulty is compounded by the low rate of autopsies in the academic hospitals where such studies are conducted.\r"

  ".W": "In general, fungi are saprophytes that are well adapted to grow in nature supported by diverse nutritional substrates. For fungi, in contrast to many other microorganisms that infect humans, parasitism is an accidental phenomenon rather than an obligatory requirement for survival. Thus, with progressive improvement in our capabilities to prolong survival of patients with global defects in host defense mechanisms, clinical experience suggests that human tissues may support growth of numerous species of saprophytic fungi that share the capacity to grow at 37 degrees C. Normally, however, a broad array of natural and acquired host defense mechanisms make the occurrence of progressive, systemic, life-threatening mycoses extremely rare events. When one or another of these host defense mechanisms is compromised, one of a variety of significant fungal infections may then progress. Mycoses may be broadly categorized into those controlled largely by natural cellular defenses vs. acquired cell-mediated immunity. Notwithstanding data that permit such general classification of host factors controlling one or another invasive mycosis, the diverse structural and antigenic properties of individual fungi create unique patterns of infections in individual, characteristic host settings. Thus, while some broad generalizations are possible, definition of predisposing factors for specific individual mycoses (and, ultimately, prospects for corrective immunotherapy) requires careful characterization of diverse features of fungal forms mediating divergent immune responses.\r"

New modalities of antifungal therapy are extensively evaluated, including various preparations of liposomal amphotericin B and promising new agents such as itraconazole and fluconazole. Numerous studies indicate the potential benefit of liposomal amphotericin B. In particular, a dramatic decrease in the incidence of immediate adverse effects as compared with the incidence with amphotericin B complexed with deoxycholate has been documented. In addition, a prolonged in vitro antifungal activity has been observed with unilamellar liposomes. As yet there is no standardized commercially available preparation of liposomal amphotericin B. Extensive research in this field is in progress. Large comparative studies for the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of these preparations are planned. Intranasal administration of amphotericin B seems useful for the prevention of aspergillosis in predisposed patients. These various approaches should improve the management and prognosis of fungal infections.\r"

Such information provides the basis for a rational approach to the development of anti-HIV drugs and suggests that combinations of drugs acting at different sites in the HIV life cycle can be studied. In vitro synergy has been demonstrated for several such combinations. While many compounds have shown promise in vitro, only zidovudine (AZT), a 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogue, has demonstrated efficacy in a controlled clinical trial and has been licensed for the treatment of certain subsets of patients with HIV infection. However, other drugs are in phase I and II clinical trials in the United States as well as abroad. In the United States, a national program for the timely identification and preclinical and clinical study of agents with activity against HIV has been established and promises to serve as an effective mechanism for the development of effective chemotherapy against HIV.\r"

The factors influencing drug entry into the CSF include the status of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lipid solubility, molecular weight, pKa, protein binding, and removal of the drug from the CSF by an exit pump in the choroid plexus. The most important of these factors is the status of the complex BBB systems. The morphologic equivalent of the BBB and its specialized functions (e.g., transport of D-glucose, amino acids, and ions) are discussed in depth. Methods developed for increasing drug delivery to the CNS by circumvention and/or manipulation of the BBB have included direct injection into the CSF, administration of prodrugs or chemical delivery systems, or reversible \"opening\" of the BBB by hyperosmotic agents, pentylenetetrazole, etoposide, DMSO, or other agents. The relevance of these general principles to selected examples of CNS infections (i.e., gram-negative aerobic bacillary meningitis and subacute encephalopathy associated with AIDS) is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "Primary infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) in seronegative patients is acquired most commonly from blood products or marrow taken from seropositive donors, whereas recurrent infection in seropositive patients appears to be derived predominantly from reactivation of latent endogenous virus. Not all infected patients develop symptomatic CMV disease; the factors that determine severity of infection and recovery are not yet fully defined. The epidemiology of CMV infection indicates that primary infection is preventable by use of seronegative blood products, including marrow. Such techniques should be implemented immediately. Leukocyte depletion of blood products is a potential alternative, but both efficacy and logistics of implementation require further study in patients who need large quantities of blood products. The efficacy of passive immunoprophylaxis with immunoglobulins remains uncertain, and this modality cannot be recommended until additional data are available. Among seropositive patients, antiviral agents may be used to suppress CMV infection until periods of improved immunocompetence. Although not effective for the treatment of established CMV infection, intravenous acyclovir significantly reduced the probability of CMV infection and disease and improved survival in a controlled trial. The newer antiviral agents ganciclovir and foscarnet should provide better protection, although the marrow toxicity of ganciclovir is problematic. Future directions will include attempts to restore specific immune responses with subunit or recombinant vaccines and adoptive immunotherapy with CMV-specific effector cells generated in vitro.\r"

Because infections in the immunosuppressed patient may be caused by unusual organisms whose identification requires special techniques, close communication between the physician and the laboratory is important. New technologies allow the clinical microbiology laboratory to gather important diagnostic information more readily. When these results are delivered rapidly to physicians via computerized information systems, care of the immunosuppressed patient is significantly enhanced.\r"

Mutations at the W locus affect various aspects of hematopoiesis and the proliferation and migration of primordial germ cells and melanoblasts during development to varying degrees of severity. The W42 mutation has a particularly severe effect in both the homozygous and the heterozygous states. The molecular basis of the W42 mutation was determined. The c-kit protein products in homozygous mutant mast cells were expressed normally but displayed a defective tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Nucleotide sequence analysis of mutant complementary DNAs revealed a missense mutation that replaces aspartic acid with asparagine at position 790 in the c-kit protein product. Aspartic acid-790 is a conserved residue in all protein kinases. These results provide an explanation for the dominant nature of the W42 mutation and provide insight into the mechanism of c-kit-mediated signal transduction.\r"

When the insufficient width of bone removal or remaining compression factor was found, an additional technique could be performed immediately, and the IOSU was helpful for prevention of cervical reoperation and improvement of surgical results. The degree of spinal pulsations observed in IOSU was of great value in the prediction of the prognosis for spinal cord postoperatively.\r"

Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied.

The results of previous studies using platelet-derived wound healing formula (PDWHF), derived from autologous platelets, provided evidence that PDWHF actively stimulates repair of the wound. To test whether or not PDWHF accelerates repair, a prospectively randomized, blinded trial was conducted using a placebo control. A total of 32 patients with chronic, nonhealing, cutaneous wounds of the lower extremity were randomized and treated for eight weeks with PDWHF or placebo. Epithelialization of the wound was the end point of study. In the group who received treatment, 81 per cent of patients had epithelialization in eight weeks compared with 15 per cent in the control group (p less than 0.0001). After crossover to treatment with PDWHF, all of the patients in the control group had epithelialization in an average of 7.1 weeks. Regression analysis of the rates of epithelialization also showed significant differences during the initial eight week trial and showed no difference after crossover of the control group to therapy with PDWHF. Results from this study demonstrate a highly statistically significant effect of topically applied platelet-derived growth factors on the repair of chronic, nonhealing, cutaneous ulcers.\r"

The probability of an intra-abdominal injury being present if findings from lavage were positive ranged from 0.448 to 1.0. The probability of an intra-abdominal injury being present if findings from lavage were negative ranged from zero to 0.286. These probabilities varied with the criteria for positivity, technique used and type of trauma.

  ".W": "Prior to the 17th century, there was considerable confusion regarding the process of digestion. Although some physicians were certain that it was initiated by acid in the stomach, both the source and the nature of the acid were unclear. In the early 19th century, Prout confirmed the active secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach and related it to the symptoms of dyspepsia. Jacob Helm and, subsequently, Beaumont studied digestion in humans with gastric fistulas and each commented extensively on the physiologic manifestation of digestion. The role of the vagus nerves in the control of gastric acid secretion was identified in the early and mid-19th century by Brodie, and subsequently elaborated upon by Pavlov. By the early 20th century, Latarjet and Jaboulay in France, performing operations for abdominal pain and tabes, reported the effects of vagotomy on acid secretion and gastric motility. In 1943, Dragstedt, in the United States, reported the cure of duodenal peptic ulcer disease by supradiaphragmatic vagotomy. He later observed the substantial delays in emptying of the stomach, which necessitated the introduction of concomitant gastric drainage procedures, such as gastrojejunostomy and pyloroplasty. In 1902, Bayliss and Starling had described the existence of a chemical regulator of function--secretin--which they termed a hormone. Shortly thereafter, Edkins reported results of studies that supported the presence of an acid regulatory hormone, gastrin, in the antrum of the stomach. Unfortunately, controversy marred this observation, and the action of gastrin was for more than 30 years ascribed to histamine. Komarov, in 1938, confirmed the existence of gastrin and its stimulatory effects on acid secretion. Physiologic recognition of the roles of vagal stimulation and antral gastrin in the secretion of acid from the stomach resulted in the development of the operation of vagotomy and antrectomy for peptic ulcer disease. Studies of the pylorus and the motility of the stomach resulted in an appreciation of the genesis of the postgastrectomy syndromes. By the middle of the 20th century, a clear appreciation of the morphologic characteristics of the parietal cell and its ability to secrete hydrochloric acid was under way. The complex metabolic process of the cell was correlated with the major morphologic transformation necessary to generate secretion of hydrochloric acid. The development of sophisticated research technology allowed the appreciation of the complex intracellular processes necessary to allow the generation of a 2.5 million-fold gradient of hydrogen ion secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Although many of these operations are done on an elective basis, the perioperative control of blood glucose levels--ranging from 6.7 to 13.3 mmol per liter (120 to 240 mg per dl)--remains a therapeutic challenge. In planning the management, the type of diabetes, current treatment, the degree of recent control, the presence of complications, and the type of surgical procedure must all be considered. All insulin-dependent patients and many non-insulin-dependent ones need insulin therapy perioperatively. The variable stress associated with major procedures such as coronary artery bypass and kidney transplantation makes a flexible insulin regimen desirable, which can be provided using a continuous insulin (regular) infusion system and frequent bedside blood glucose monitoring. Implementing such a regimen facilitates rapid control before an operation and a quick response to blood glucose changes during the procedure and provides a convenient and predictable method of control during the postoperative period.\r"

A hyperkinetic circulation characterized by increased cardiac output and decreased arterial pressure and peripheral resistance is typical. Despite this hyperkinetic circulation, some patients with alcoholic cirrhosis have subclinical cardiomyopathy with evidence of abnormal ventricular function unmasked by physiologic or pharmacologic stress. Florid congestive alcoholic cardiomyopathy develops in a small percentage, but the concurrent presence of cirrhosis seems to retard the occurrence of overt heart failure. Even nonalcoholic cirrhosis may be associated with latent cardiomyopathy, although overt heart failure is not observed. Tense ascites is associated with some cardiac compromise, and removing or mobilizing ascitic fluid by paracentesis or peritoneovenous shunting results in short-term increases in cardiac output. Cirrhosis also appears to be associated with a decreased risk of major coronary atherosclerosis and an increased risk of bacterial endocarditis. Small hemodynamically insignificant pericardial effusions may be seen in ascitic patients. The release of atrial natriuretic peptide appears to be unimpaired in cirrhosis, although the kidney may be hyporesponsive to its natriuretic effects.\r"

The serum beta 2-M concentrations in the normal outpatients (2020.1 +/- 276.6 micrograms/L) were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than those observed for outpatients (2833.3 +/- 202.6 micrograms/L) or patients with CF (2861.8 +/- 340.5 micrograms/L. There were no significant differences found for creatinine clearance or fractional excretion of beta 2-M when subjects without CF were compared with those with the disease. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in hospitalized patients with CF when creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of beta 2-M were compared between the initiation and conclusion of aminoglycoside treatment. Glomerular filtration and proximal tubular reabsorption of beta 2-M were not altered in patients with CF. These findings do not support a global defect in proximal renal tubular reabsorption as the underlying cause for altered aminoglycoside clearance in patients with CF.\r"

This article reviews the effect of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, direct vasodilators, and calcium-channel blockers on cerebral blood flow in various populations. Although many investigations have been performed, it remains difficult to predict the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion due to antihypertensive medication in an individual patient. It is best for practitioners to be aware of the patient populations at risk and treat high blood pressure cautiously in these patients.\r"

The free fraction of quinidine also varies widely. Thus the development of procedures that could be widely used to determine quinidine free concentrations would be highly desirable. It was the purpose of this study to evaluate several procedures available to determine total serum quinidine concentrations (rate nephelometry [ICS], homogenous enzyme immunoassay [EMIT], and high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Furthermore, in samples from 46 patients, equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration procedures were compared for their ability to estimate quinidine free fraction. Finally, unbound concentrations of quinidine were compared using a modified EMIT procedure and a standard HPLC method to quantitate quinidine in ultrafiltrates from patient samples. For the measurement of total quinidine concentrations, reasonable agreement was seen when EMIT and ICS systems were compared with HPLC (ICS = 1.03.HPLC + 0.96, r = 0.93; EMIT = 1.08.HPLC + 0.38, r = 0.93) The mean errors, however, for these procedures were high (ICS +70 percent, range +7 to +233 percent; EMIT +35 percent, range 0 to 110 percent). Quinidine free fractions (QFF) determined by equilibrium dialysis (E) and ultrafiltration (U) showed good agreement (QFF(U) = 1.11.QFF(E) +0.0; r = 0.96). Unbound quinidine concentration determined by EMIT analysis of ultrafiltrate substantially overestimated the values obtained by HPLC analysis (mean error by EMIT 104 +/- 59 percent). It is concluded that HPLC is the method of choice for determining both total and unbound serum quinidine concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Psychologic dependence, however, is intense and is the primary problem in cocaine addiction. Although withdrawal symptoms are both somatic and visceral, severe depression is the dominant symptom. Therapy for withdrawal symptoms is not specific, but desipramine, bromocriptine and lithium have shown considerable promise. Acute overdose requires life support therapy. Appropriate pharmacologic interventions include intravenous diazepam to control central nervous system symptoms and propranolol or labetalol to control arrhythmias and hypertension.\r"

The baseline electrocardiogram was obtained 50 +/- 10 hours after AMI and compared with subsequent electrocardiograms at 48 and 72 hours after baseline record and at discharge. Plasma CK-MB was assayed every 12 hours after baseline. A total of 76 patients (14%) progressed to Q-wave AMI. Compared to the 468 patients who retained non-Q-wave AMI, those patients who evolved Q-wave AMI were more likely to exhibit ST elevation greater than or equal to 1.0 mm in greater than or equal to 2 infarct-related leads (49 vs 32%, p less than 0.005), higher peak CK values with the index AMI (754 +/- 625 vs 611 +/- 604 IU; p = 0.0018) and a greater incidence of CK-MB-confirmed extensions (18.5 vs 5.5%, p less than 0.0001). For those patients progressing to Q-wave AMI within 48 hours of baseline electrocardiogram, CK-MB extension occurred in 9.5% (4 of 42) versus 29.4% (10 of 34) of those who progressed after 48 hours (p = 0.0262). A distinct minority (14%) of patients with non-Q-wave AMI will develop Q waves before discharge. The progression to Q-wave AMI after initial non-Q-wave AMI appears to involve 2 different mechanisms: temporal lag in the electrocardiogram, and actual extension by quantitative CK-MB criteria.\r"

After follow-up procedures, 252 responded, of which 18% were academically-based, 29% were hospital-based and 53% were office-based. Attitudes about antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias were influenced by the presence and severity of cardiac disease, the presence and severity of cardiac disease, the presence of symptoms and the type of ventricular arrhythmias. In this survey, only 1% of cardiologists treated patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature complexes and no heart disease, but 17% treated such patients if unsustained ventricular tachycardia was present. The treatment rate among cardiologists increased to 38% when coronary artery disease with left ventricular dysfunction was present in patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature complexes. The presence of any cardiac disease and symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias increased the treatment rate to 80 to 100%. Approximately 50% of responding physicians treated patients comparable to the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial study population with antiarrhythmic drugs. Beta blockers were the most common antiarrhythmic drug class chosen as the most appropriate initial therapy in new patients with ventricular arrhythmias. Whereas no cardiologists thought that amiodarone was appropriate to initiate in new patients with benign or potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias, as many as 33 to 43% of cardiologists would use amiodarone for refractory patients with such arrhythmias, a response contradictory to the approved labeling for this drug. Less than one half of cardiologists recognize the high potential organ toxicity for quinidine, procainamide and tocainide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90102323\r", 
  ".W": "Sotalol is a nonselective, water-soluble beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with no membrane-stabilizing activity or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Sotalol is, essentially, completely absorbed and is not metabolized. Consequently, bioavailability is close to 100%. Age and food have slight but unimportant effects on bioavailability. Cmax of sotalol is 2 to 3 hours with a t1/2 between 7 and 15 hours. Excretion of sotalol is primarily through the kidneys, with no metabolism by liver and no first-pass effect. Therefore, sotalol plasma levels and half-life are directly related to creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate. Appropriate dose adjustments must be made for patients with impaired renal function or increased renal blood flow, as in pregnancy. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic effects of sotalol are directly related to plasma levels, which, in turn, are directly related to dose. However, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonism t1/2 is longer than the sotalol plasma t1/2. As a consequence of its ability to prolong the action potential duration, sotalol also increases cardiac contractility in isolated ventricular, but not atrial, preparations by 20 to 40%. This positive inotropic effect is not blocked by beta or alpha blockade or reserpine pretreatment and seems to be related to sotalol's effects on cardiac ionic currents. Like the effects of sotalol on action potential duration, the positive inotropic effects are inversely proportional to rate. The hemodynamics of sotalol indicate a relative lack of direct cardiac depressant activity in both animals and humans. The typical hemodynamic effects of sotalol in normotensive humans, even with depressed myocardial function, are a reduction in heart rate with little or no change in blood pressure, a reduction in cardiac output with no change in stroke volume, and little or no change in pulmonary wedge pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or volume, and little or no change in ejection fraction either at rest or during exercise.\r"

Their membrane-stabilizing properties may be a contributing factor. Sotalol is currently thought not to cause significant myocardial depression. Intravenous sotalol administration has minimal effects on resting stroke volume, although heart rate and consequently cardiac output are significantly decreased. Systolic blood pressure decreases, with a minimal change in diastolic or mean pressure. Hemodynamic effects are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes of administration. Hemodynamic indexes are maintained even in patients with mildly depressed ejection fractions (mean ejection fraction of 43 +/- 15%) after oral sotalol administration. Although heart rate decreases, cardiac index is unchanged because of a significant increase in stroke volume index. The latter results from an increase in preload (secondary to bradycardia) and a decrease in afterload. Sotalol is well tolerated, although occasionally it may cause worsening heart failure. This is seen in patients with markedly depressed left ventricular function and inadequate cardiac reserve characterized by an inability to increase stroke volume and cardiac output with exercise. Long-term (1-year) patient follow-up reveals no significant hemodynamic deterioration from initial values obtained after oral administration.\r"

  ".U": "90102326\r", 
  ".W": "Although numerous pathophysiologic states, such as hypocalcemia and hypothyroidism, lengthen repolarization and are associated with a reduced incidence of cardiac fibrillation, the concept of the pharmacologic control of rhythm disorders by prolonging the action potential duration is relatively new. There is now a great deal of interest in the relative merits and applicability of delaying conduction or prolonging refractoriness as ways to prevent arrhythmias. Prolonging the action potential duration in cardiac tissues lengthens the refractory period without affecting conduction, prolongs the cycle length of the tachycardia, and prevents it from deteriorating into fibrillation. Lengthening the action potential duration is also associated with a positive inotropic effect demonstrated most readily in isolated cardiac tissues, an important feature in antiarrhythmic agents intended for use in life-threatening tachyarrhythmias in patients with reduced ventricular function. This array of properties was first recognized in the beta blocker sotalol and formed the basis for a discrete class of antiarrhythmic mechanism--the so-called class III electrophysiologic effect. Such a series of actions was also recognized early in the case of amiodarone, which has a much more complex pharmacologic profile. Clinical studies with sotalol and amiodarone have done much to establish the clinical use of prolonging the action potential duration in controlling a broad spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias. Both amiodarone and sotalol prolong the action potential duration and attenuate adrenergic stimulation, but they do so by fundamentally different mechanisms. The electrophysiologic properties of sotalol represent the combined effects of beta blockade and lengthening the action potential duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effectiveness of 2 doses of sotalol for complex ventricular arrhythmias has been compared with placebo in a 6-week, multicenter study (parallel, double-blind design) in 102 patients. The frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) was reduced only 10% with placebo, 75% with low-dose sotalol (160 mg administered twice daily) and 88% with high-dose sotalol (320 mg administered twice daily) (both p less than 0.05 vs placebo). The defined efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC suppression) was achieved by 6% of patients taking placebo, 34% of patients taking low- and 71% of patients taking high-dose sotalol. Sotalol was generally well tolerated, especially with the lower dose. Heart rate decreased, and PR and QTc intervals increased modestly. An open, randomized, crossover study compared sotalol with procainamide in 33 patients. A reduction in VPCs of greater than or equal to 75% was achieved in 22 patients (67%) with sotalol and in 13 patients (39%) with procainamide. Quinidine and sotalol have also been compared in a multicenter study in patients with chronic, complex VPCs, with results to be presented in the near future. Thus, sotalol's antiarrhythmic efficacy is well demonstrated by comparisons with placebo, and its effectiveness and tolerance are likely to compare favorably with standard class I drugs, suggesting its potential as a first-line antiarrhythmic agent.\r"

It is not known whether such an effect is mediated by suppression of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs). The circadian rhythmicity of ventricular arrhythmia can also be suppressed by beta-blocking drugs, and this may help reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death during the morning hours. Recent studies have also shown that beta blockers can provide a safe and effective combination with class IA antiarrhythmic agents when arrhythmias cannot be controlled with class IA agents alone. Sotalol, a nonselective beta antagonist, has unique electrophysiologic properties, and several studies have shown it to be more effective than conventional beta blockers in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias. However, direct comparative studies of the suppression of VPCs are lacking. In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study, the antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol and propranolol were compared in 172 patients with greater than 30 VPCs/hour. After the initial 1-week washout and 1-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to either 160 mg of sotalol administered twice daily (76 patients) or 40 mg of propranolol administered 3 times daily (91 patients). Those responding to therapy (decreases greater than 75% VPCs) continued to take these doses, but nonresponders were given higher doses, 320 mg of sotalol twice daily or 80 mg of propranolol 3 times daily, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several studies have shown that sotalol is very effective in treating life-threatening arrhythmias. One hundred thirty-eight patients with inducible and clinically sustained tachycardia were retrospectively analyzed. With the use of the S1S2S3 stimulation protocol for ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction, sotalol prevented VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF) induction in 45% of the patients; other class I agents prevented VT/VF induction in only 15 to 22%. Data were also analyzed from a prospective multicenter study comparing sotalol with procainamide in suppressing sustained VT in 153 patients with symptomatic sustained VT/VF. With the use of the S1S2S3S4 stimulation protocol, sotalol prevented VT/VF induction in 35% of the patients, whereas procainamide prevented VT/VF induction in only 22% (difference not significant). When patients whose VT induced by the triple-stimuli protocol were excluded, sotalol prevented VT induction in 53%. These findings indicate that the antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol are comparable to those of class I agents in treating malignant arrhythmias. Although more data are needed on the comparative effects of sotalol, available data establish sotalol as an important addition to available antiarrhythmic agents.\r"

Most patients were middle-aged male Caucasians with significant heart disease. The most serious adverse event was proarrhythmia, occurring in 56 patients (4.3%). Of these, 27 had hemodynamic compromise due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Most had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF) or cardiomyopathy, or a combination of these. The other 29 had nonsevere events; 38% continued taking sotalol. Proarrhythmia was manifested by torsades de pointes in 24 of the 56 patients. No universal causal relation was found with commonly associated factors such as bradycardia, hypokalemia and long QT interval. The mean QT and QTc at baseline within 1 week of a severe proarrhythmic event were greater than those of patients not having proarrhythmia. Nineteen patients (1%) discontinued therapy with sotalol because of drug-related CHF. Predisposing conditions included low initial baseline ejection fraction, history of CHF, cardiomyopathy or cardiomegaly, or both, male gender and age greater than 65 years. Heart failure usually occurred within 7 to 30 days of initiating therapy. The most common reason for premature discontinuation of the drug in patients treated for sustained ventricular tachycardia was ineffectiveness (39%), whereas adverse effects were the most common reasons among patients treated for complex ventricular ectopy (21%). Dyspnea and bradycardia were the most common cardiovascular effects, and fatigue, dizziness and asthenia the most common noncardiac, adverse effects. Although frequently reported, these adverse effects resulted in discontinuation of only 1 to 4% of the patients at risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has since been shown to be a property shared by an increasing number of compounds. Sotalol has an additional propensity for blocking beta receptors; therefore, its net effects in controlling arrhythmias result from its beta-blocking actions as well as lengthening the refractory period of cardiac muscle. The properties of amiodarone, another class III agent, are even more complex. The potency of these 2 agents must therefore be distinguished from the so-called \"pure\" class III agents, which may exhibit a more restricted spectrum of action. Available data indicate that prolonged QT interval (the correlate of prolonged cardiac repolarization) merely provides the substrate for antifibrillatory and proarrhythmic actions relative to the absence or presence of associated pharmacologic properties of the compounds or to the clinical setting in which these compounds are used. Thus, class III agents might be expected to exhibit a variable spectrum of efficacy as antifibrillatory drugs with an equally variable incidence of torsades de pointes and so induce a proarrhythmic effect. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences, especially at a cellular level, may provide the basis for the development of newer, clinically relevant antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory compounds.\r"

The automated method uses the shearing action of fluid movement generated by a reciprocating paddle system. When compared on 11 samples, the automated instrument always isolated cells in less time, usually requiring only 15-30 seconds in contrast to 10-15 minutes for the manual method. The time comparisons involved \"set up\" time of the required minor equipment as well as the time to make a complete single cell suspension from the portion of the biopsy sample sent to the Flow Cytometry Lab so extra cells could be used for other purposes and cryogenically stored for future reference. Cells isolated by the automated method from various B-lymphocytic and T-lymphocytic malignancies were still viable and could be successfully immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The immunophenotyping results were compared for both cell isolation methods on seven of these samples, and the results were comparable. The automated technique has now been used to satisfactorily immunophenotype more than 50 biopsy samples. The automated method should represent a significant aid for clinical flow cytometry laboratories performing immunophenotyping tests by efficiently preparing single cell suspensions in a few seconds instead of minutes. Furthermore, the automated method uses a closed sterile bag system that helps minimize the exposure of personnel to potential infectious material present in biopsy samples and prevents external contamination of cell suspensions. The automated technique proven successful for immunophenotyping may also be helpful for related procedures involving hematopoietic malignancies such as DNA content analysis and cell functional assays by flow cytometry, as well as other assays such as tissue typing, gene probe, and in vitro chemosensitivity assays.\r"

In pancreatitis there was an increased expression of FAP protein in the acinar tissue in relation to inflammatory changes. In cases of primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma and metastatic tumors in the pancreas, a strong expression of FAP protein in the peritumoral acinar area was found.

  ".W": "Twenty-three cases of bronchial gland cell (BGC) type lung adenocarcinoma were examined clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically. BGC type adenocarcinoma was defined as adenocarcinoma showing histologic and cytologic differentiation toward the bronchial gland. This type of adenocarcinoma occurred more frequently in younger patients (mean age, 50.5 years) than in patients with other types of adenocarcinoma (mean age, 60.1 years). It had a tendency to arise from relatively large bronchi and show endobronchial growth. However, there was no difference in disease stage based on tumor, nodal involvement, metastases (TNM) factors and outcome between BGC type adenocarcinoma and peripheral type adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, 50%, 68%, and 64% of BGC type adenocarcinomas were positive for carcinoembryonic antigen, surfactant apoprotein, and secretory component, respectively. Peripheral type adenocarcinomas showed similar rates of immunohistochemical stainability of these antigens. The positive reaction of BGC type adenocarcinomas with anti-surfactant apoprotein antibody may indicate maintenance of traces of differentiation toward peripheral airway epithelium. Lactoferrin is characteristically detected in BGC type adenocarcinomas, although the positive rate was not very high.\r"

  ".W": "Seven cases of alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPSs) were studied immunohistochemically for the presence of a number of differentiation markers in an attempt to define the cellular nature of this tumor. Desmin-positive tumor cells were found in three and muscle actin-positive cells in four cases when studied in formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded material. In one case studied in frozen sections, focal desmin positivity but no other intermediate filaments were found. Immunostaining for synaptophysin, a general neuroendocrine marker, was negative in all cases. All tumors were positive with a monoclonal antibody NK1C3, which consistently stains melanomas, and three cases showed significant numbers of S-100 protein-positive tumor cells, but immunostaining with HMB-45, a melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody, was negative in all cases. However, several rhabdomyosarcomas studied for NK1C3 and S-100 protein for comparison were also at least focally positive. Electron microscopic examination, performed in three cases, showed uniform paucity of all kinds of filaments in the tumor cells of ASPS, and it specifically failed to reveal any signs of smooth or striated muscle cell differentiation. Thus, the results of the present study do not unequivocally define the nature of ASPS but speak against its paraganglionic character and present evidence for muscle cell differentiation.\r"

In the thymuses studied, Hassall's corpuscles contained abundant immunoreactive CK, PNA-r, and H antigens, whereas CEA, SJA-r, and EMA were present focally in Hassall's corpuscles. Immunoreactive CK, PNA-r, and CEA were demonstrated focally in the subcapsular region, cortical nurse cells, and subcapsular-perivascular monocytic cells, respectively. PNA-r was present in all 12 epithelial type tumors, including all eight thymomas. CEA was present in nine tumors, including six thymomas. Six thymomas contained H antigen and SJA-r; five continued CK and EMA. SJA-r and EMA were also present in one carcinoid tumor of thymic origin. In epithelial thymomas, the antigens stained nests of epithelial cells resembling the pattern of staining in Hassall's corpuscles. Membrane staining of spindle cells of both spindle cell and epithelial thymomas was less intense than staining of epithelial type cells.\r"

  ".W": "The authors reviewed 28 primary noncutaneous T-cell lymphomas, referred to the Comprehensive Cancer Center Amsterdam, using the updated Kiel classification. Clinical course was related with stage of disease, morphologic subtype, and immunophenotype of the tumor cells. The incidence of primary noncutaneous T-cell lymphomas was 4.1 cases per 1,000,000 people per year. Morphologic classification was difficult and arbitrary. Immunohistochemistry contributed considerably in diagnosis of this group of tumors. All primary noncutaneous T-cell lymphomas had a poor prognosis, with no significant difference between predominantly small cell (low-grade) and large cell (high-grade) tumors. The only parameter significantly correlating with survival was the stage of the disease at presentation. The results suggest that all types of primary noncutaneous T-cell lymphoma are to be considered high grade and that primary localization (cutaneous vs. noncutaneous) and stage of disease at presentation appear to be more important as predictors of clinical outcome than morphologic or immunophenotypic subtype.\r"

  ".U": "90102362\r", 
  ".W": "Although many recent studies have begun exploring the diagnostic utility of anti-B- and anti-T-cell antibodies that work on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, the most optimal panel to use remains uncertain. In addition, many of the published reports have used antibodies obtained before their commercial formulation and distribution. For these reasons, B5-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 174 reactive or neoplastic lymphoid and hematopoietic proliferations were immunostained with the commercially obtained antibodies 4KB5, UCHL-1, and, in selected cases, L26. In reactive nodes, 4KB5 stained B-cell areas and UCHL-1 T-cell areas. Seventy-nine percent of the B-cell neoplasms were 4KB5 positive, and only 2% were UCHL-1 positive. Two cases of myeloma were 4KB5 and UCHL-1 negative. The 4KB5-negative B-cell lymphomas (ML-B) were all L-26 positive. UCHL-1 stained 78% of the T-cell lymphomas (ML-T), and 4KB5 stained 14%. In the five 4KB5-positive putative T-cell lymphomas, immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies were performed. In Hodgkin's disease (HD), Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells were UCHL-1 negative in 75% of cases and occasionally positive in 25%. Definite 4KB5 positivity of RS cells was identified in both cases of lymphocyte predominant HD and in one case of nodular sclerosing HD with monomorphic large cell areas. With the exception of 1 of 15 acute nonlymphocytic leukemias that was UCHL-1 positive, all acute leukemias were 4KB5 and UCHL-1 negative. In summary, commercially obtained 4KB5 and UCHL-1 form a useful but not absolutely specific or sensitive paraffin section immunoperoxidase panel for the categorization of B- and T-cell lymphoid neoplasms. Addition of L26 appears to add to the sensitivity and specificity of the panel. Definite immunophenotypic distinction of HD from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, particularly of T-cell type, often was not possible.\r"

  ".U": "90102365\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) was studied immunohistochemically in 106 cases of gastric carcinoma. Of the 45 intestinal-type carcinomas, 34 cases (76%) expressed PSTI: 15 (63%) of 24 early carcinomas and 19 (90%) of 21 advanced carcinomas, the incidence being significantly different (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, in the intestinal-type carcinomas, a significant correlation was observed between PSTI expression and clinical stage or nodal involvement. On the other hand, of the 61 diffuse-type carcinomas, including 27 early and 34 advanced carcinomas, 54 cases (89%) were positive for PSTI; a high incidence of the PSTI expression was observed in both early and advanced carcinomas, being 93% and 85%, respectively. Moreover, PSTI-positive cells were localized in more than half of the early diffuse-type gastric carcinomas at the invading zone of the surrounding tissues. The incidence of PSTI expression in advanced scirrhous-type carcinomas (100%) was significantly higher than that (76%) in medullary-type ones (P less than 0.05). Thus, the present findings, together with the previous reports that PSTI stimulates 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA in human fibroblasts, suggest that the PSTI expressed in gastric carcinomas may possibly possess a biologic function responsible for the tumor growth and progression and for the stromal proliferation of fibrous tissues.\r"

The reaction rates with both vaccines were low; APDT vaccine recipients had significantly less pain and warmth at the injection site than did DTP vaccine recipients. Antibody responses to pertussis antigens (lymphocytosis-promoting factor, filamentous hemagglutinin, and agglutinogens) and to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids were all brisk. The APDT vaccine recipients had a more marked response in antibodies to filamentous hemagglutinin and a less marked response in agglutinins than whole-cell vaccine recipients. On the day after immunization, both APDT and DTP vaccine recipients had an increase in mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts. This APDT vaccine is immunogenic and less reactogenic than a DTP vaccine with a whole-cell pertussis component when administered as a booster to 4- to 6-year-old children.\r"

During the 17-year study period, 275 infants had anencephaly (0.36 per 1000 total births), 526 had spina bifida (0.69 per 1000 total births), 112 had encephaloceles (0.15 per 1000 total births), and 370 had hydrocephalus (0.48 per 1000 total births). There was a female preponderance of infants with anencephaly, spina bifida, and encephaloceles, while males predominated among those with hydrocephalus. We found declining incidences of anencephaly, spina bifida, and encephaloceles only among white females. Black infants were significantly less likely than white infants or infants of other races to have spina bifida. Twenty percent of infants with anencephaly had congenital anomalies unrelated to the primary defect, as did 40% with encephaloceles, 37% with hydrocephalus, and 22% with spina bifida. Because the racial background of the patient population closely resembles that of the United States as a whole, the features of the malformations described may reflect those of the country.\r"

Yet occasionally primary pathology involving the abdominal viscera develops, and surgery is frequently considered. The early manifestations of intraabdominal inflammation or bleeding in patients undergoing CAPD depend on the pathological process, its access to the peritoneal cavity, and whether generalized bacterial peritonitis supervenes to obscure helpful physical findings. Clear dialysate is not a reliable sign that major pathology is absent, nor does initial stabilization of the clinical course with antibiotic therapy uniformly indicate that surgery will not be necessary. Polymicrobial peritonitis may develop in cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or from a colonic source, the latter featuring more bacterial species and more gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. A history directed at progression of symptoms and sites of abdominal discomfort and an examination for deep local tenderness and bowel incarcerated in an abdominal wall hernia are essential. Measurement of dialysate amylase and Gram stain of dialysate for food fibers may be helpful. Imaging techniques such as abdominal radiographs for dilated bowel or free subdiaphragmatic air, ultrasonography of the gallbladder or pancreas, computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the lower abdomen, and water-soluble contrast colonic studies may help identify the pathologic process. Special studies such as these should be considered early in the course of suspected unusual abdominal events in patients on CAPD.\r"

The correlations of hematocrit with clinical factors, laboratory values, and renal cystic changes were investigated. Time on dialysis was the strongest single predictor of hematocrit for the whole group (r = 0.351, P less than 0.001) and for men and women analyzed separately. Longitudinal 5-year (n = 83) and 10-year (n = 21) data showed a continuous increase in hematocrit levels over time (r = 0.414, P less than 0.001 over 10 years). Patients at the dialyzer reuse center (n = 224) had higher hematocrit levels than those at the center that did not reuse (n = 59). Although time on dialysis was strongly correlated with increasing extent of renal cystic change (r = 0.387, P less than 0.001), the correlations of cyst extent and time on dialysis with hematocrit were not independent by multiple regression analysis. We conclude that hematocrit increases progressively over time in patients on chronic hemodialysis. The mechanisms responsible for this do not seem to involve cystic transformation of the kidneys and remain unclear.\r"

It is of note that the patient had never undergone hemodialysis and had suffered only one episode of peritonitis. Both features are of interest, as the few reports of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) in CAPD include patients who have been hemodialyzed and have suffered repeated episodes of peritonitis, both conditions being incriminated in the genesis of B2M amyloidosis. We conclude that DRA may develop in the absence of artificial membranes or frequent peritonitis episodes.\r"

The (mutant) acid alpha-glucosidase alleles of crucial family members were segregated in human-mouse somatic cell hybrids to investigate their individual function. Two types of mutant alleles were identified. The first leads to complete deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase. Homozygosity of this allele is demonstrated in three cases of severe infantile glycogenosis type II in the family under study. The second mutant allele is characterized by a reduced net production of catalytically active acid alpha-glucosidase, resulting in partial enzyme deficiency. The eldest patient in the family, with very mild clinical symptoms, is shown to be a compound heterozygote having both types of mutant alleles. These studies emphasize the effect of allelic diversity on the level of residual acid alpha-glucosidase activity and on the clinical course of glycogenosis type II.\r"

Interestingly, there exists a considerable dissociation between the time course of ACE inhibition and that of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Due to the greatly improved methodology used to estimate the degree of ACE inhibition in vitro and in vivo, it has become evident that the compensatory increase in renin levels in response to ACE inhibition is the key factor determining the degree and duration of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system resulting from ACE inhibition. A better understanding of these relationships would seem to be useful in determining duration of action and particularly the optimal dose of any ACE inhibitor.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing and compelling evidence continues to amass that favors the existence of local tissue renin-angiotensin systems. All renin-angiotensin system components have been demonstrated in kidney, brain, arteries, adrenals, and other organs. Favoring its clinical importance are direct demonstration of its components in tissues; dissociation between hemodynamic and structural effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibition; evidence for local modulating roles with other humoral, autocrine/paracrine, and growth factors; and the effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients who are anephric or have low plasma renin activity. Evidence will be presented demonstrating the hemodynamic/structural dissociation of pharmacologic agents that reduce cardiac mass in spontaneously hypertensive rats with left ventricular hypertrophy. Although centrally active adrenolytic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists all reduce cardiac mass, their structural and cardiac functional effects differ greatly. Even within the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group their effects vary: improving, impairing, or not changing the Frank-Starling relationships. It is postulated that there is great variability of cardiac intramyocytic penetration of the pharmacologic agents and of their local intracellular effects on mitogenesis. The implications for cardiac function and therapy are vast.\r"

  ".U": "90102491\r", 
  ".W": "It is proposed that in essential hypertension there are two functionally abnormal populations of nephrons. One is ischemic; chronically hypersecreting renin and underexcreting sodium. The other, the larger population, is in adaptive hypernatriuresis with its renin secretion chronically suppressed. Nephrons in these two populations, each with its own detector-effector apparatus for renin secretion and sodium excretion, behave according to their individual needs, producing a physiologic discordance expressed in high blood pressure even with plasma renin levels in the so-called \"normal\" range. The unsuppressed and inappropriate renin secretion from the ischemic nephrons impairs renal function in ischemic and hyperfiltering nephrons alike, but in very different ways. To maintain glomerular filtration rate and an adequate excretion of sodium, the ischemic nephrons require a higher rate of renin secretion than they are actually receiving, because at low perfusion pressures maximal angiotensin II-induced efferent arteriolar constriction is needed to maintain glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, the compensating hypernatriuretic nephrons become unable fully to excrete dietary sodium because they are exposed to an unwanted, inappropriately high angiotensin II level coming from the ischemic nephrons. This angiotensin II impairs sodium excretion (adaptive hypernatriuresis) from unaffected, adapting nephrons by promoting proximal sodium reabsorption and by inducing afferent constriction. The net result is that all nephrons are exposed to angiotensin II levels inappropriate for their needs. This leads to impaired ability to excrete sodium by both populations of nephrons, with sodium retention in the presence of abnormal renin secretion and perpetuation of the hypertension. The hypothesis is consistent with the hallmark pathology of multifocal afferent arteriolar narrowing seen in essential hypertension as well as with the characteristic renal hemodynamic pattern of vasoconstriction with reduced renal blood flow but with maintained glomerular filtration rate. The \"normal\" glomerular filtration rate as well as the often \"normal\" plasma renin activity may be seen as the sum of effects on the two abnormally acting populations of nephrons. Further, since any circulating renin is inappropriate in the presence of hypertension, the hypothesis helps explain why angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure even when renin levels are not elevated.\r"

Blockade of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might therefore be expected to result in a reduction of sympathetic activity and enhanced parasympathetic activity. Whether this is so in normotensive or hypertensive humans and in human cardiac failure is unclear, since available techniques for recording activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are imperfect. Nevertheless, most evidence that comes from measurements of venous norepinephrine suggests that the ACE inhibitors have little or no effect on sympathetic activity in normotension and hypertension, although the activated sympathetic system in severe cardiac failure is probably suppressed. It appears that the ACE inhibitors have a parasympathomimetic action that may contribute to the hemodynamic effects of these drugs. Additional information using direct recordings of sympathetic traffic or measurements of norepinephrine \"spillover\" is needed to clarify the effects of ACE inhibitors on the sympathetic system.\r"

After a four-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients received 1 mg of cilazapril once daily for the first four weeks. This dose was then increased to 2.5 mg once daily for the next four weeks for patients whose pre-dose sitting diastolic blood pressure was above 90 mm Hg. Similarly, at Week 8 the dose was increased in such patients from 1 to 2.5 mg or from 2.5 to 5 mg once daily. A 12-hour blood pressure profile was performed on the first day of active treatment and of each dose increase. Mean decrease of sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline (102.7 +/- 0.4 mm Hg) at Week 12 was 13.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Seventy-five percent of patients had a decrease of 10 mm Hg or more from baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure, and in 60 percent sitting diastolic blood pressure normalized. Unexpectedly large decreases of blood pressure after the first dose were seen only in three patients and none had clinical symptoms. Fourteen patients (16.9 percent) reported adverse events, but most of these were judged unlikely to be related to therapy. Four patients with predisposing underlying diseases experienced potentially serious adverse events (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and blood pressure elevation) whose relationship to therapy was judged remote or only possible. There was no particular pattern of changes in laboratory values. The results indicate that cilazapril is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug for the elderly.\r"

Blood pressure at entry was 158/103 mm Hg (cilazapril) and 160/103 mm Hg (hydrochlorothiazide). Cilazapril 2.5 mg caused a decrease in blood pressure of 14.7 +/- 2.3/12.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg compared with a decrease of 12.6 +/- 2.2/10.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Those patients who required an increase of dosage to the higher level then showed decreases of 15.0 +/- 2.1/14.3 +/- 1.2 (cilazapril) and 19.7 +/- 1.9/13.3 +/- 1.2 hydrochlorothiazide. All decreases in blood pressure were statistically significant but were not statistically different from each other. Fifty-one percent of patients reached a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less receiving 2.5 mg of cilazapril and an additional 28 percent of patients reached this goal receiving 5 mg. The figures for patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide were comparable: 36 and 35 percent. Twenty-one adverse events remotely, possibly, or probably related to therapy were reported with cilazapril and 32 with hydrochlorothiazide. Three patients withdrew from cilazapril because of mild angioedema, headaches, and chest pain, respectively, and three patients withdrew from hydrochlorothiazide treatment because of fatigue, dizziness, and gastric hemorrhage. Hydrochlorothiazide caused a decrease in potassium levels and an increase in levels of cholesterol, uric acid, urea and - gamma cilazapril had no adverse biochemical effects. Cilazapril lowered blood pressure to the same extent as hydrochlorothiazide. Young patients had better responses to cilazapril than to hydrochlorothiazide. It is concluded that cilazapril is an effective and safe drug for patients with mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "In clinical pharmacology studies cilazapril, after its bioactivation to cilazaprilat, was characterized as a potent, reversible angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a terminal half-life of 30 to 50 hours consistent with saturable binding to ACE. Despite the arterial vasodilation, only slight increases in heart rate were found. Cilazapril had no acute effect on cardiovascular reflexes. Cilazapril increased effective renal plasma flow slightly. Glomerular filtration rate remained unaltered. A close and steep correlation between cilazaprilat plasma concentration and ACE inhibition was found. The potency of cilazaprilat, defined as the concentration of cilazaprilat causing 50 percent ACE inhibition, was approximately 1 ng/ml plasma. In short-term studies in hypertensive patients, it appeared that more than 90 percent of plasma ACE inhibition is needed to obtain blood pressure reduction. The result of various dose-response studies established the indirect relationship between dose, plasma concentration of the drug, and the blood pressure response and identified the dose producing maximal effect (i.e., 5 mg). Cilazapril had relatively long-lasting effects on ACE inhibition. In patients with severe chronic renal impairment or hepatic failure, the duration of ACE inhibition of cilazapril was prolonged. In these patients a reduction of the dose and/or less frequent dosing is recommended. There was no clinically relevant interaction of cilazapril with food or furosemide. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide on sodium and chloride excretion were potentiated by cilazapril. An additive effect of propranolol and nitrendipine on the blood pressure response to cilazapril was observed. An interaction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cilazapril might occur, potentially reducing the blood pressure lowering effect. In general cilazapril was well tolerated.\r"

All patients had concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (measured by echocardiography), unimpaired systolic function (measured by radionuclide ventriculography), and long-standing hypertension treated by a combination of beta-blockers and diuretics. Radionuclide scintigraphy was performed with cilazapril and placebo, given one week apart. A two-week washout period of all cardioactive drugs preceded the study. Within three hours after oral administration of cilazapril, the time to peak filling rate of the left ventricle, expressed as a percentage of diastole, was reduced from 44.5 +/- 13.2 percent to 31.2 +/- 7.2 percent (p less than 0.05). Systolic blood pressure was also significantly reduced by cilazapril. Heart rate was slightly reduced. Left ventricular ejection fraction, peak filling rate, and the absolute time to peak filling rate were not significantly altered. Cilazapril improves a sensitive index of diastolic cardiac function in hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "Cuff blood pressure measurements by doctors and self blood pressure measurements by patients reflect imprecisely 24-hour or daytime mean blood pressure values. This limits the physician's ability to diagnose the absence or presence of hypertension. It also limits his ability to evaluate the response to non-pharmacologic interventions or antihypertensive drugs. This is a major disadvantage because the prognosis of hypertensive persons depends to a large extent on the blood pressure attained during treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a valid method for assessing the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment because it allows the physician: (1) to determine whether the initially elevated blood pressure is reduced under the various circumstances of the patient's lifetime; and (2) to exclude that this reduction is associated with hypotensive events that might interfere with organ nutrition and function during the day and night. However, this approach has a cost that makes its use impractical in clinical practice, except in cases in which there are reasons to suspect very low or excessively high blood pressures in conditions that are out of the reach of sphygmomanometry. Furthermore, the prognostic value of on-treatment ambulatory blood pressures is still unknown. On the other hand, studies on new antihypertensive agents derive great benefits from the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. This is emphasized by the fact that the ambulatory blood pressure values are more reproducible than isolated cuff blood pressure values, allowing the number of patients necessary to establish an antihypertensive effect to be reduced. Furthermore, these values are little affected by placebo influences thus permitting simplification of the study design. Finally, sequential analysis of the data obtained provides accurate information on the duration of the antihypertensive effect, and thus on the optimal posology to be adopted. However, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring does have technical problems. In the case of non-invasive monitoring, the ability to measure blood pressure phasic events and variability is limited. Another problem, which is of greater importance, is that non-invasive blood pressure monitoring devices generate a number of artifactual and imprecise readings. These problems cannot be entirely eliminated by editing the blood pressure tracing.\r"

Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased in all patients and seven of the 11 required 5.0 mg daily. There was no significant change in the effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine clearance, although the renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced. Albuminuria was reduced in most patients but the mean change was not significant. The mean plasma potassium concentration rose significantly, but no changes in electrolyte excretion or weight were noted. Mean ambulant plasma renin activity was normal before treatment and rose significantly. Mean ambulant angiotensin II concentrations did not change. Mean ambulant plasma aldosterone concentration and mean urinary aldosterone excretion decreased significantly. Plasma arginine vasopressin and cortisol concentrations did not change. No changes were noted in plasma glucose concentrations, liver function tests, hemoglobin concentrations, or white blood cell or platelet counts.

At the later stages of congestive heart failure, the cardiac effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may have added benefits in the periphery. Normalization of the vasodilatory response to exercise, increase in renal blood flow, and possibly urinary sodium excretion, as well as prevention of hypokalemia tend to improve exercise capacity, quality of life, and survival in patients with severe congestive heart failure.\r"

Ninety-five percent of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (MIC, more than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Clostridium spp., including Clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the Bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. Ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the MICs by one doubling concentration. A modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: MICs with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. Susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. Correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin MICs have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm.

The bactericidal effect (inability to pass in the absence of antibiotics) was less than or equal to 1 microgram for 26 of the 27 isolates.

Ofloxacin is less active (MIC90, 8 to 25 micrograms/ml) against Ureaplasma urealyticum.

Passage on increasing concentrations of quinolones, however, results in highly resistant strains of many species. Chromosomal mutations have been shown to produce two mechanisms of resistance, alterations in the A subunit of the target enzyme, DNA gyrase, and decreased drug accumulation associated with altered porin outer membrane proteins and pleiotropic resistance. For some mutants reduced accumulation appears to depend on active quinolone efflux across the inner membrane. Resistance developing during quinolone therapy of infections has been infrequent to date and reported most often with P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and at sites with poor quinolone penetration or foreign bodies. Resistance should be monitored, and the means for limiting its development studied.\r"

First, ofloxacin is more completely absorbed, achieves higher peak serum concentrations, and has a longer terminal elimination half-life, which result in a fivefold greater area under the curve than that of ciprofloxacin when similar doses are orally administered. Ofloxacin's more favorable pharmacokinetic profile seems to compensate at least in part for the greater activity of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative bacilli in vitro. Second, ofloxacin is eliminated almost entirely via the kidneys, whereas ciprofloxacin is eliminated via both the kidneys and non-renal routes. This suggests that ciprofloxacin may be preferable for patients with variable renal function, whereas ofloxacin may be preferable for patients receiving dialysis because of the need for less frequent administration. Third, concomitant use of ciprofloxacin with either theophylline or caffeine decreases elimination and thereby results in elevated serum concentrations of these methylxanthine derivatives. Because ofloxacin does not cause clinically significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of either theophylline or caffeine, it may be preferable for patients using these concomitantly.\r"

These metabolic alterations involve the piperazinyl moiety and usually result in compounds with significantly less microbiologic activity than the parent drugs. Of particular importance is the varying extent of formation of the oxoquinolone metabolite with all fluoroquinolones except ofloxacin. Available evidence suggests that the inhibition of metabolism of drugs such as theophylline and caffeine by quinolones is related to the production of the oxoquinolone metabolite. With all antibiotics, differences in microbiologic activity and pharmacokinetics influence the choice of one agent over another for individual patient selection or consideration for hospital formulary inclusion. For the quinolones the degree and type of metabolism may be a strong factor in this selection process.\r"

Maternal toxicity and embryotoxicity were noted, but there was no teratogenicity in rats or rabbits. There was no impairment of fertility, and no adverse effects on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of offspring occurred. Target-organ studies revealed no evidence of ocular toxicity in rats, nephrotoxicity in rabbits, or antigenicity or ototoxicity in guinea pigs. Overall, the toxicologic evaluation of ofloxacin has shown this compound to be a drug with a low toxicologic potential.\r"

Bacterial pathogens were recovered from 60 percent of the patients, with Haemophilus influenzae (33 isolates) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 isolates) being the most common. Ofloxacin was found to be a safe, well-tolerated therapeutic agent, which was as effective clinically as amoxicillin or erythromycin and with an advantage of less frequent administration. Ofloxacin was more effective than amoxicillin (90 percent versus 75 percent; p = 0.05) in elimination of pathogenic bacteria from lower airway cultures. Caution should be exercised in the use of ofloxacin, at least in short-term treatment regimens, with anaerobic pulmonary infections; additional information is needed for S. pneumoniae given the relatively high minimal inhibitory concentrations for this species.\r"

  ".W": "In a single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 100 successive patients were enrolled with serious skin and soft-tissue infections, whose illnesses had precipitated an initial hospital admission or an extension of inpatient care. There were 93 evaluable patients who received either ofloxacin, 400 mg orally every 12 hours plus an intravenously administered placebo every eight hours, or cefotaxime, 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours plus an orally administered placebo every 12 hours. The average length of therapy was 12 days. Both patient groups had similar demographics and underlying conditions. Wound infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by abscess, cellulitis, and trophic ulcer. Multiple pathogens were commonly isolated from infected sites (1.4 pathogens/patient). The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus/Providencia spp., and Enterobacter spp. Persistence of the initial pathogen at the end of therapy was observed in 22.5 percent of the cefotaxime-treated group, but in only 10 percent of the ofloxacin-treated group. There was one clinical failure in the cefotaxime group, caused by a susceptible strain of Enterobacter cloacae, and there was one clinical failure in the ofloxacin group, in which the patient had an Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus wound infection and subsequently developed a P. aeruginosa superinfection. Adverse experiences, including rash, insomnia, and nausea, occurred in 16 percent of the patients in each group. It was concluded that oral ofloxacin is as safe and efficacious as parenteral cefotaxime in the treatment of serious skin and skin structure infections.\r"

Compared with carbenicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in separate studies of complicated urinary tract infection, ofloxacin achieved a significantly higher rate (p = 0.048) of microbiologic cures and more clinical cures than carbenicillin, while essentially matching the efficacy of the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination. Most common organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the first study and Escherichia coli in the second. In preliminary data from the prostatitis study comparing ofloxacin 300 mg given twice daily with carbenicillin 764 mg given every six hours, microbiologic cure rates were 100 percent with both medications. However, clinical cure rates were significantly higher (p = 0.048) with ofloxacin. Throughout these trials, ofloxacin has shown excellent safety and tolerability, with a lower incidence of nausea and diarrhea than with carbenicillin, and less nausea and rash than with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In all treatment groups, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were uncommon and unrelated to the medications. Overall, these studies indicate that in complicated urinary tract infection the efficacy of ofloxacin is comparable with that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and superior to that of carbenicillin. In chronic bacterial prostatitis, results to date suggest that ofloxacin may be more effective clinically and as effective microbiologically as carbenicillin.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the results of chemotherapy in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site is complicated by the small sizes of most treatment series and patient heterogeneity. Careful evaluation of clinical and pathologic information may identify patients with a relatively high likelihood of response to systemic therapy. This includes patients in whom immunohistochemical studies or electron microscopy, or both, suggest a likely tumor type responsive to systemic therapy, such as prostate cancer, lymphoma, or a neuroendocrine tumor. Clinical evaluation can also identify potentially responsive patients, particularly those with clinical features in common with the extragonadal germ cell tumor syndrome. For patients who do not fit into these more treatable categories, most combination chemotherapy programs have response rates of less than 30% and median survivals of less than one year. Randomized trials have not established any clearly superior chemotherapy program. Regimens containing both Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and mitomycin-C produce response rates of approximately 25% but are associated with the possibility of severe hematologic toxicity, and rarely a syndrome resembling the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The choice between chemotherapy and supportive care only must be individualized, and the latter option is appropriate for many patients. More detailed clinical and pathologic analyses in conjunction with clinical trials, particularly employing newer diagnostic techniques, are vital to provide better prospective data from which to identify relevant clinical subsets that allow an estimate of an individual patient's likelihood of response and the suitability of systemic chemotherapy.\r"

A total of 109 patients seen in the latent phase of labor in the labor and delivery area were studied. Both an abnormal initial fetal heart rate and an amniotic fluid index less than or equal to 5.0 cm were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of intrapartum fetal distress. Conversely, a systolic/diastolic ratio greater than 3.0 by Doppler ultrasonography was not associated with increased fetal morbidity. Overall, the sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values of the fetal heart rate tracing and the amniotic fluid volume assessment were comparable. Doppler systolic/diastolic ratios showed very poor sensitivity and positive predictive value. We conclude that the fetal heart rate tracing or the assessment of amniotic fluid volume in the early intrapartum period are reasonable predictors of subsequent fetal condition. The lack of patients with the absence of or reverse umbilical velocity preclude conclusions with regard to Doppler systolic/diastolic ratios for this purpose.\r"

There was no significant difference in the ability of uterine, umbilical, or combined velocimetry to predict preterm birth or adverse pregnancy outcome.

The study population consisted of fetuses whose systolic/diastolic ratio was greater than 2 SD above the mean for gestational age. The matched control population consisted of fetuses with similar gestational ages, indications for testing, and estimated fetal weights with normal systolic/diastolic ratios. Abnormal Doppler results were used only to determine the frequency of fetal testing. Biophysical profile testing was performed semiweekly on all patients. Patients with absent or reversed end-diastolic flow were admitted for daily testing. The following criteria were used as indications for delivery: (1) worsening maternal condition, (2) oligohydramnios, (3) intrauterine growth retardation with lung maturity, and (4) biophysical profile score less than or equal to 4. Fifty-one patients (7%) had abnormal Doppler blood flow velocity studies. When the study population was compared with the control population at the time of delivery, there were no differences in umbilical artery pH, Apgar score, or incidence of intrauterine growth retardation. However, study patients were delivered at a significantly lower gestational age and lower birth weight and experienced a higher likelihood of neonatal intensive care unit admission. When study patients with documented end-diastolic flow were compared with study patients with no end-diastolic flow, there were no differences in umbilical artery pH, Apgar score, or incidence of intrauterine growth retardation. However, fetuses with no end-diastolic flow had a significantly shorter test-to-delivery interval, lower gestational age, lower birth weight, and more neonatal intensive care unit admissions. There were no perinatal deaths among the study patients. The range of systolic/diastolic ratios for the five patients who failed to follow our protocol for intensive maternal-fetal surveillance was 4.3 to infinity; all experienced fetal death within 18 days. These results suggest that immediate delivery of the fetus with diminished end-diastolic flow may not be mandatory. The combined use of fetal biophysical testing and commonly used criteria for delivery results in acceptable fetal outcome and prolongation of gestational age.\r"

Eleven of the fetuses manifested ductal constriction within 48 hours of therapy, whereas two fetuses had constriction after 1 week of therapy. Six of the 13 fetuses also manifested tricuspid insufficiency in association with constriction of the ductus arteriosus. All abnormal cardiac changes resolved in utero after discontinuation of indomethacin. No difference in the pulsatility index values of the middle cerebral artery was observed in the fetuses with ductal constriction but without tricuspid regurgitation (n = 7) when the values were compared with those obtained in absence of ductal constriction (1.87 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.88 +/- 0.33). In the fetuses that manifested both ductal constriction and tricuspid insufficiency (n = 6), the pulsatility index values in the middle cerebral artery were significantly lower in the presence of ductal constriction when compared with the values obtained in the absence of ductal constriction (2.22 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.34). These results indicate that a response to indomethacin sufficient to cause both ductal constriction and tricuspid insufficiency decreases the pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro steroid production by a virilizing Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor of the ovary was studied. For comparison, stromal tissue from the opposite normal ovary was also incubated under similar conditions. The tumor fragments secreted significantly more testosterone (527 +/- 168 versus 48 +/- 29 pg/mg tissue, p less than 0.001), androstenedione (1188 +/- 400 versus 40 +/- 10 pg/mg tissue, p less than 0.001), and dehydroepiandrosterone (419 +/- 132 versus 73 +/- 25 pg/mg tissue, p less than 0.004) than that of normal ovarian stroma. Measurement of steroids in the ovarian venous serum draining the tumor indicated a peripheral ovarian gradient for both delta 4 and delta 5 steroids. Incubation of tumor fragments with luteinizing hormone alone resulted in a significant increase in the secretion of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (p less than 0.05). Addition of insulin to luteinizing hormone resulted in significantly greater release of androstenedione than that of treatment with luteinizing hormone alone (p less than 0.04). Addition of insulin had no effect on the release of dehydroepiandrosterone. Luteinizing hormone and insulin, either alone or in combination, failed to produce any change in the secretion of testosterone. We conclude that (1) increased testosterone secretion by Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor resulted from increased availability of precursors from both delta 4 and delta 5 pathways; (2) the tumor was responsive to luteinizing hormone with an increase in the secretion of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone; (3) insulin acts synergistically with luteinizing hormone to increase secretion of androstenedione; (4) the tumor has specific binding sites for insulin; and (5) the increased levels of insulin and luteinizing hormone in polycystic ovarian disease may play a role in the pathogenesis of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor.\r"

Other tissues in which estrogen receptors have not been consistently identified, such as bone, are also affected by waning levels of estrogen. The postmenopausal woman frequently experiences neuroendocrine changes (hot flashes) that often dissipate over time and a steady rise in her risk of cardiovascular disease, which approaches that in men of comparable age.\r"

Estrogen replacement therapy enhances a woman's sense of well-being and reduces the morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with osteoporosis and atherosclerotic heart disease. There are a few absolute contraindications to estrogen replacement therapy. Many estrogen preparations are currently available in the United States. Establishing equivalencies among the different preparations is complicated by the many physiologic and pharmacologic effects of estrogens and the variety of treatment end points used. Most estrogens have the same biologic effect provided equivalent blood levels are achieved. Estrogen replacement therapy has proved beneficial to selected postmenopausal women.\r"

Epidemiologic data from case-control and prospective cohort studies have suggested that estrogen use may confer protection from cardiovascular disease and decrease all-cause mortality rates in postmenopausal women. Because the age-adjusted mortality rate due to heart disease among American women is approximately four times the combined mortality rate due to endometrial and breast cancers, even modest changes in the risk of fatal heart disease after estrogen use would dramatically impact the overall risk-benefit equation.\r"

Although many of these troublesome side effects can be managed by adjusting the dose or changing the source of the estrogen or progestin components, postmenopausal women view withdrawal bleeding as the most negative factor influencing their decision to use hormonal replacement therapy. Additionally, the potential link between postmenopausal estrogen use and subsequent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer concerns potential users. Cyclic progestins protect the endometrium from hyperplastic changes but may not prevent withdrawal bleeding. Both patient and physician education, including the nature of menopause and the protective role of estrogens in osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, are critical to improving compliance with hormonal replacement therapy.\r"

The results of intravenously enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, selective hepatic arterial contrast CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were compared with operative findings. A total of 227 lesions were identified, with the sensitivity for tumor detection being arteriographically enhanced CT 94% (p less than 0.01), MRI 70%, and CT 66%. This advantage for arteriographically enhanced CT was most marked for lesions less than 1 cm in diameter (82% versus 20% for MRI and 5% for CT; p less than 0.01). Arteriographically enhanced CT was also most sensitive in assessing tumor margins. MRI was clearly superior to arteriographically enhanced CT or CT in detecting vascular involvement (85% versus 30% and 8%, respectively; p less than 0.01). No imaging technique was sensitive in determining extrahepatic involvement. Arteriographically enhanced CT was also best at predicting the operative procedure. The combination of arteriographically enhanced CT and MRI was the best predictor of true disease. We conclude that both arteriographically enhanced CT and MRI should be used for preoperative assessment of hepatic malignancies.\r"

Those patients who require insulin require small doses and have stable diabetes. Pain has recurred in 7 of the 11 patients who underwent distal subtotal resection; 5 of them required pancreatoduodenectomy and completion pancreatectomy for pain relief. Because of the high rate of recurrence of pain after distal resection, we favor pancreatoduodenectomy as the initial procedure of choice. When distal near-total or total pancreatectomy is required, the addition of segmental autotransplantation offers definitive, although at times transient, benefits in glucose homeostasis compared with no transplantation.\r"

Seventy-one had classic pancreas divisum (type 1); 23 had only a dorsal duct with an absent Wirsung's duct (type 2); and 6 had a filamentous connection between the two duct systems (type 3). Accessory papilla sphincteroplasty was performed in 88 patients, with a mean follow-up of 53 months. The orifice was stenotic at the mucosal level in 66 patients. Seventy percent of patients have shown improvement: 85% if the accessory papilla was stenotic, compared with 27% if it was not (p less than 0.0001); and 82% with discrete attacks, compared with 56% with chronic pain (p = 0.002). Judged against intraoperative calibration of accessory papilla orifice diameter, ultrasonography with secretin stimulation was 78% sensitive for accessory papilla stenosis, with 3% false-positive results. Ultrasonography with secretin stimulation was the best predictor of surgical success: positive = 92% success (attacks or pain) versus negative = 40% success (64% with attacks; 21% with pain). There have been seven restenoses with six reoperations. We conclude that (1) pancreas divisum is but one variety of pancreatic anatomy characterized by a dominant dorsal duct and dependence on secretion through the accessory papilla; (2) accessory papilla stenosis appears to be a necessary cofactor to produce a morbid state, whether episodic pancreatitis or pancreatic pain; (3) presentation with pancreatitis and a positive result on the ultrasound-secretin test are the best predictors of successful accessory papilla sphincteroplasty.\r"

Whereas the cytotoxic activity in the dialyzed serum showed a single peak with a maximum value 8 hr after the start of ethanol consumption in the healthy volunteers, it showed two peaks with maximum values at 2 and 8 hr in the patients with cirrhosis. Studies of the fractions obtained by Sephacryl-S-300 gel filtration of the 2-hr postalcohol serum samples revealed substantial cytotoxic activity in the fractions containing both the albumin peak and the IgG peak in the patients with cirrhosis and only in the fractions containing the albumin peak in the healthy volunteers. Experiments with pure IgG preparations obtained from prealcohol and 2-hr postalcohol sera by chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion-exchange resin showed considerable cytotoxic activity in the preparations from the patients with cirrhosis and little or no cytotoxic activity in those from the healthy volunteers. Thus, the early peak of the biphasic serum cytotoxicity curve seen after ethanol consumption by patients with cirrhosis appeared to be caused by the development of a substantial cytotoxic activity in the IgG molecules during the first 2 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The method employs rat liver ADH isolated and purified with Cap-Gapp affinity chromatography. Antiserum to rat liver ADH is generated in rabbits, and used in the peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemical method. The method is compatible with both light and electron microscopic methods of tissue preparation. In the present report we describe the identification of ADH in neurons of the mammillary bodies, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of normal adult rats. In all brain tissues examined, the enzyme is limited to neuronal cytoplasm, and only to some neurons. The restriction of the enzyme to a limited percentage of neurons in the central nervous system may help to account for the difficulty in demonstrating the enzyme in whole brain homogenates, as the dilution of enzyme-bearing cytoplasm with a large volume of enzymatically inactive tissue would reduce the specific activity of the enzyme to near the limit of detectability. In the cerebellar cortex, the enzyme is found only in Purkinje cell cytoplasm. In the other regions examined, we are unable to identify by other criteria a specific neuronal class that consistently displays ADH reactivity. The reactive cells seem to be generally midrange in size and bipolar or multipolar in configuration. The presence of ADH in certain neurons leads us to speculate that intraneuronal ethanol metabolism may lead to focal accumulation of acetaldehyde. The intracellular presence of this toxin may in turn help to account for brain dysfunction in acute ethanol intoxication, and the neuropathology of chronic alcohol abuse.\r"

The cytosolic and membrane fractions of whole brain PKC activities are significantly less in LS mice than in SS mice. There are significant differences in PKC activity between brain areas in both the SS and LS lines. Ethanol given in ataxic doses results in significantly increased amounts in PKC activity in whole brain cytosolic fractions and in some brain areas but equally in both SS and LS mice. Ethanol added in vitro reduced enzyme activity slightly in SS brain membranes, suggesting that the mechanism of the increase in PKC activity seen after in vivo administration is indirect. These results indicate that PKC is not involved in the mechanism whereby LS and SS mice differ in alcohol sensitivity. Direct intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, resulted in increased sleep times in both SS and LS mice. ICV injection of PMA also caused a more marked decrease in body temperature in LS than in SS mice. The half-life of PMA in brain was determined to be 9.6 hr and no metabolites could be detected. At limiting calcium concentrations, PMA added in vitro activated PKC equally well in both lines. However, PMA given ICV did not alter the level of PKC as determined in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ethanol concentration in these tissues was compared to that in capillary and arterial blood. The data was characterized by fitting to a mathematical model. The highest ethanol concentrations in orbital capillary blood were measured 10 min after the injections. Ethanol content in testis homogenate and interstitial fluid did not generally differ from that of orbital blood. However, in rete testis fluid the highest ethanol values were measured at 60 min by the 1.5 g/kg dose and at 30 min by 0.75 g/kg. Ethanol values before this differed from those of capillary blood and interstitial fluid (p less than 0.05-0.001). In seminiferous tubules, the highest ethanol concentration was reached at 20 min, and ethanol content was in general lower than in orbital blood (p less than 0.001-0.01). Ethanol levels in epididymal fluid were comparable to capillary blood. The transportability factor from the model for rete testis was low, which indicates a barrier of penetration of ethanol from blood. In addition, water contents of testicular compartments were calculated. The area under the curve values of rete testis and seminiferous tubules were approximately 10 and 30%, respectively, smaller than that of interstitial fluid, for example. Therefore, the germ cells are somewhat better protected from ethanol than the interstitial cells.\r"
