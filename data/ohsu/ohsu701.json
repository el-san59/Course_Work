Ovarian hyperstimulation was achieved with clomifene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropins. Only one GIFT was performed during a weekend (1.8%). The implantation rate was 41.1% and the evolutive pregnancy rate 30.4%. The endocrinological influence of these regimens are discussed by comparison of those observed in an in vitro fertilization program. The main influence is a decreased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level in the preovulatory phase.\r"

Both in vivo and in vitro tests were standardized and performed after an oral course of estrogen therapy. Crossed in vitro sperm-cervical mucus penetration test, evaluated in 277 couples with CM of patients' wives and additionally with CM and semen of fertile donors, revealed that the male factor contributed to a significantly higher extent to deficient sperm-mucus interaction than the cervical factor. The overall pregnancy rate after 6 months was 23% (64/277). Whereas the outcome of PCT did not significantly predict subsequent fertility (PCT good pregnancy rate 24%/PCT poor 20%), significant differences were found for the sperm-cervical mucus penetration test with CM of patients' wives (pregnancy rate, 30.5% versus 8.5%) and for in vitro testing with donors' CM, but not for the mucus penetration test with donors' spermatozoa. Routine sperm analysis did not prove to be of prognostic value for a subsequent pregnancy. The results suggest that the in vitro sperm-cervical mucus penetration test is a good parameter of sperm function and, in particular, when performed as a cross-matching penetrability test, a valuable adjunct to PCT with regard to fertility prognosis.\r"

In 15 men with unexplained infertility, 6 patients showed lack of acrosome reaction, whereas 9 men had sperm acrosome reactions similar to that of fertile men. However, in this cohort under study, semen characteristics of AR(+) and AR(-) patients were similar. In addition to inducing sperm acrosome reaction, follicular fluid also promoted significant changes in motion characteristics of capacitated sperm. Sperm curvilinear velocity (Vc) increased significantly after exposure to follicular fluid though linearity remained unchanged. The largest difference in cumulative Vc occurred at 90 microns/s. Assessing the ability of capacitated sperm to acrosome react may have clinical significance in predicting whether such sperm are capable of fertilizing an ovum.\r"

The E2-induced luteinizing-hormone (LH) surge of control animals was abrogated by P and/or RU 486. Secretory transformation by P was inhibited by RU 486 coadministration. RU 486 alone (1 mg/kg) induced endometrial secretory transformation, but higher doses (5 mg/kg) inhibited proliferation and secretory activity. Thus in the presence of P, RU 486 is antagonistic but, in absence of P, exhibits endometrial progestational effects at low doses and an antiproliferative (antiestrogenic) effect at higher doses. These data encourage continued evaluation of RU 486 as a potential contraceptive agent acting at the pituitary and/or endometrial level.\r"

The loss of fertility is usually an unexpected, invisible, deeply painful wound for those couples who are considering the use of donor gametes. As they address the psychological issues of these techniques, they must also heal the wounds created by infertility. This type of grieving and examination of feelings takes time and information. The medical community needs to encourage each couple to resolve the issues around infertility and to use available personal, professional, and written resources to address the dilemmas raised by the use of donor gametes prior to embarking on this type of treatment. In so doing, the couple will reduce the likelihood that the means of conceiving their children will become a source of major conflict in their family. In 1932 Aldous Huxley prophesied the destructive consequences of scientific accomplishment without social involvement and psychological guidance. He said: \"The sciences of matter can be applied in such a way that they will destroy life or make the living of it impossibly complex and uncomfortable...unless used as instruments by biologists and psychologists.\" It is our concern that the procedures for enabling infertile couples to become parents may, if not accompanied by acknowledgment of the unique challenges which they create for all participants in the process, make the living of life \"impossibly complex and uncomfortable\" for the very families we are trying to help.\r"

Thirty of 37 women fulfilled the above mentioned strict criteria and underwent endometrial biopsy in the late luteal phase. Seven of 30 (23%) demonstrated a delay in endometrial development and all had normal hormonal and ultrasonographic parameters of folliculogenesis and ovulation. Women with delayed endometrial development demonstrated slightly longer follicular phases (17.0 +/- 1.1 versus 14.5 +/- 0.3 days).

Five patients with microadenomas and 4 with macroadenomas had normal prolactin (PRL) levels with Parlodel LAR 50 mg after one (5 patients), two (2 patients), or five (2 patients) injections; two patients with macroadenomas had normal or near normal PRL levels only after 4 monthly injections of 100 mg. Clinical improvement paralleled the changes in serum PRL. A complete normalization of a visual field defect occurred in one patient after 5 months of therapy. Marked shrinkage of the adenoma was shown by magnetic resonance and/or computed tomographical imaging in three patients with macroadenomas after 1 week. Side-effects were mild and usually transient. Parlodel LAR represents a novel treatment of hyperprolactinemic states which is both effective and well tolerated, and appears to be a useful alternative to oral therapy for long-term treatment.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Hyskon on lymphocyte and macrophage activity in vitro. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peritoneal fluid leukocytes were isolated from infertile women and fertile controls. Lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by hemocytometer cell counts and 3H-thymidine incorporation. Macrophage function was determined by phagocytosis of fluorescent microspheres. Hyskon significantly inhibited lymphocyte proliferation and macrophage phagocytosis in all groups. Hyskon did not affect cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The results of this study indicate that Hyskon has immunosuppressive effects in vitro suggesting a new mechanism by which Hyskon may reduce postoperative adhesion formation.\r"

Two thousand eighty-five patients had a total of 7397 oocytes and pre-implantation embryos frozen. The number of oocytes, zygotes, cleaved embryos, and blastocysts frozen, thawed, transferred, and the resulting number of pregnancies were 463/127/8/0, 2,133/778/540/47, 4,460/1,567/1,089/68, and 341/186/138/3, respectively. The number of embryos transferred per pregnancy and pregnancy rate per transfer for zygotes, cleaved embryos, and blastocysts were 11.5/17.4%, 16.0/12.5%, and 46.0/4.3%, respectively. The average number of frozen-thawed embryos transferred per pregnancy was 15.0 and the average clinical pregnancy rate per transfer was 13.4%. Forty-eight births have resulted in 41 singletons and 7 sets of twins. Of centers reporting frozen-thawed transfers, 54.6% (12/22) have at least one clinical pregnancy and 75.0% (9/12) of centers reporting a pregnancy have at least one birth.\r"

Overall fertilization rate was 47.9%. No pregnancies were observed in 10 patients with one embryo transferred. Recurrence rate of delayed fertilization per patient was 17.3%; overall ongoing pregnancy rate/cycle was 10.3%. Although repetitiveness of delayed fertilization is low, it seems to impact negatively on IVF results.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiological understanding of inflammatory bowel disease has been limited by the referral bases of most inflammatory bowel disease studies. The Colitis-Ileitis Study Group of Rochester, N.Y., developed a community-wide, computerized cumulative registry of all inflammatory bowel disease patients hospitalized at the 8 community hospitals for 1973-86. Clinical data were abstracted from each of the 1651 identified hospital charts. All of these patients resided in Monroe County (city and suburbs) and the 5 contiguous counties (Genesee/Finger Lakes Region, population 1,030,640). Of the 1651 hospital patients identified in the study, 1358 resided in Monroe County (Rochester and its immediate suburbs, population 702,238). Incidence, defined as time of onset of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, rose from baseline rates in the 1930s to peak in 1980 (Crohn's disease = 50.29/10(5) per decade, ulcerative colitis = 35.12/10(5) per decade) and declined through 1986. For Crohn's disease, the age-specific incidence rates peaked in the 20-29-yr-old group in each of the 5 decades studied. Ulcerative colitis seems to occur at all ages and may have a bimodal distribution. There was a period effect, with the 1970s having the highest incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis for each age group. However, the age-specific incidence rate for Crohn's disease showed a 40% decrease in the 1980s compared with the 1970s in the 10-39-yr-old group (p less than 0.001). The age-specific incidence rate for ulcerative colitis showed a 50% decrease in the 1980s compared with the 1970s in the 10-49-yr-old group (p less than 0.001).\r"

Although most patients and physicians prefer Golytely lavage over other methods of bowel cleansing, its highly salty taste is a drawback. This report describes the development of a modified lavage solution that has a barely perceptible salty taste. This solution was developed by removing sodium sulfate, increasing the concentration of polyethylene glycol, and making minor adjustments in the concentration of other salts. Golytely, reduced sodium sulfate Golytely (Golytely-RSS), and a balanced electrolyte solution were infused into the stomachs of normal subjects. After steady-state lavage conditions were established, the rates of fluid and electrolyte absorption were measured. Average fluid absorption rate was 791 ml/h with the balanced electrolyte solution, compared with only 63 and 45 ml/h with Golytely and Golytely-RSS, respectively. Golytely-RSS was studied at 3 infusion rates, from 0.9-1.8 L/h, and the time and volume of solution required for colon cleansing was determined; the lower infusion rate (0.9 L/h) took longer but required less solution to cleanse the colon. In conclusion, Golytely-RSS has the essential feature of Golytely; i.e., lavage is associated with negligible salt and water absorption. The less-salty taste of Golytely-RSS may make it less difficult to drink and thereby enhance patient compliance; the total volume of solution required for cleansing is less when the solution is ingested at 0.9 L/h than when the ingestion rate is 1.8 L/h.\r"

Eight subjects with chronic ulcerative colitis who had undergone the operation were studied on 2 consecutive days. On 1 day, saline (154 mM NaCl) was infused into the ileal pouch, and on the other day emulsified oleic acid (152 mM) was infused. The subjects ate a 300-kcal mixed meal containing liquid labelled with 99mTc-DTPA. To assess small-bowel transit concurrently with gastric emptying, a second marker, 111In-DTPA, was instilled through a tube into the duodenum at the end of the meal. Transit of both markers was monitored scintigraphically. Infusion of oleic acid into the ileal pouch slowed gastric emptying and small-bowel transit, and delayed the time to defecation compared with saline infusion. Neither the ileal pouch infusion alone or the meal alone altered plasma levels of enteroglucagon, neurotensin, or peptide YY, but the combination of the oleic acid infusion and the meal increased the levels of all 3 hormones. It was concluded that an \"ileal brake\" on gastrointestinal transit is functional following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Oleic acid placed into the ileal pouch slowed gastrointestinal transit and delayed defecation, effects which may have clinical application. The mechanism mediating the ileal brake may in part be hormonal.\r"

In pursuit of this goal, 28 rats were randomized into 4 groups: pretreated with fructose 1-6 diphosphate (n = 7); pretreated with glucose (n = 7); post-reperfusion treated with fructose 1-6 diphosphate (n = 7); and post-reperfusion treated with saline (n = 7). Five additional rats were sham operated. Following 30 min occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, all rats received their respective treatments for 5 days. Post-reperfusion arterial pressure was significantly lower in the control rats (p less than 0.001) as well as when compared with the fructose 1-6 diphosphate groups (p less than 0.001). Significant increase in white blood cell counts occurred in the controls (p less than 0.001), whereas in the fructose 1-6 diphosphate groups white blood cell counts were no different from preischemic values. All control rats that died in less than 5 days had transmural intestinal necrosis, whereas in 3 of the controls that survived 5 days, partial intestinal necrosis was noted. Only one fructose 1-6 diphosphate-treated rat had partial intestinal necrosis. The overall 5-day survival was 100% for sham-operated rats, 93% for fructose 1-6 diphosphate-treated rats, and 21% for controls (fructose 1-6 diphosphate vs. controls, p less than 0.001; fructose 1-6 diphosphate vs. sham, NS). The results are discussed and explained in terms of the postulated mechanism based on the pharmacological properties of fructose 1-6 diphosphate.\r"

  ".W": "To prospectively assess the value of an algorithm in differentiating spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis, we performed serial paracenteses in 43 episodes of ascitic fluid infection (28 spontaneous and 15 secondary) in 40 patients. The algorithm involved identification of (a) secondary peritonitis associated with gut perforation, based on previously proposed criteria in patients with neutrocytic ascites (ascitic fluid total protein greater than 1 g/dl, glucose less than 50 mg/dl, and lactate dehydrogenase greater than the upper limit of normal for serum) and (b) separation of spontaneous from secondary peritonitis (unassociated with perforation) based on the response of the ascitic fluid cell count to antibiotic therapy. The perforation criteria had 100% sensitivity in detecting episodes of actual gut perforation; their specificity, however, was low (45%). After 48 h of treatment the concentration of ascitic fluid neutrophils was below the baseline pretreatment value in all episodes of spontaneous peritonitis but in only two thirds of the patients with secondary peritonitis. This algorithm is useful in (a) identifying patients who have infected ascites associated with perforation of an intraabdominal viscus, and (b) differentiating spontaneous from nonperforation secondary peritonitis on the basis of the response of the ascitic fluid cell count to appropriate antibiotic therapy. The optimal time for repeat paracentesis in patients with infected ascites appears to be 48 h after initiation of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of ascitic fluid has been complicated by several recently reported new tests. To simplify this assessment, we evaluated nine parameters prospectively and simultaneously in blood and ascitic fluid from 285 patients with ascites to determine which were the most reliable for immediate diagnosis of the etiology of the ascites and of its complications. Subjects were first divided into four groups: sterile cirrhotic ascites (n = 201), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (n = 41), malignant ascites (n = 34), and miscellaneous ascites (n = 9). An ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear count greater than 500/microliters was the test with the greatest accuracy (96%) for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Neither the most precise cutoff values for ascitic fluid pH (less than 7.32) and ascitic fluid lactate (greater than 32 mg/dl), nor their respective blood-ascitic fluid gradients (greater than 0.11 and less than -20 mg/dl) were more reliable indexes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, mainly due to the decreased ascitic fluid pH and increased ascitic fluid lactate observed in malignant ascites, tuberculous peritonitis, and pancreatic ascites. A blood-ascitic fluid albumin gradient less than 1.1 g/dl was the most accurate parameter for the diagnosis of malignant ascites (diagnostic efficacy, 93%). Therefore, the etiologic analysis of ascitic fluid might be simplified and the single practice of two tests, ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count and blood-ascitic fluid albumin gradient, provides immediately useful information.\r"

To investigate whether ascites can be safely mobilized in only one paracentesis session (\"total paracentesis\"), 38 cirrhotic patients with tense ascites were treated with total paracentesis plus intravenous albumin (6-8 g/L ascites removed). Standard liver tests and renal function tests, glomerular filtration rate, free water clearance, plasma volume, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone and norepinephrine concentrations were measured before and after treatment. Total paracentesis was effective in mobilizing ascites in all but 1 patient and did not impair any of the parameters studied. The volume of ascitic fluid removed and the duration of the procedure were 10.7 +/- 0.5 L (mean +/- SEM) and 60 +/- 3 min, respectively. Five of the 38 patients (13%) developed complications during the first hospital stay (hepatic encephalopathy and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 2 patients each and culture-negative bacterial peritonitis in 1). No patient developed renal impairment. This complication rate, as well as the clinical course of the disease during follow-up, estimated by the probability of readmission to hospital, causes of readmission, and survival probability after treatment, was similar to that reported in patients treated with repeated large-volume paracentesis. These results indicate that total paracentesis associated with intravenous albumin can be safely performed in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and suggest that these patients could be treated in a single-day hospitalization regime.\r"

Liver homogenates also N-methylated dopamine at more than twice the rate that they N-methylated norepinephrine. In contrast, adrenal homogenates, which N-methylate norepinephrine to form epinephrine using the enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT), methylated dopamine only about 1% as well as norepinephrine. Synthesis of epinephrine by liver homogenates was not significantly inhibited by the PNMT inhibitor SKF 29661 at a concentration that inhibited adrenal homogenate epinephrine synthesis by nearly 90%. These findings indicate that liver can synthesize epinephrine in vitro using an enzyme other than PNMT. Adrenal demedullation of rats reduced plasma epinephrine levels to 7% of control values, but left liver epinephrine and epinephrine-forming enzyme levels unchanged. Treatment of demedullated rats with 6-hydroxydopamine plus reserpine also resulted in dramatically reduced plasma epinephrine levels but no change in hepatic epinephrine and N-methylating enzyme levels. We conclude that the liver synthesizes its own epinephrine.\r"

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the interobserver agreement, the interassociations between these features, and the relationship between these signs and the degree of hepatic dysfunction. In 100 consecutive cirrhotic patients (84% with alcoholism) without history of digestive bleeding, gastroesophageal endoscopic examination was performed and recorded using a videoendoscope. Four independent observers evaluated the following endoscopic features: the size, extent, color, and red signs of esophageal varices, the mosaic pattern, congestive gastropathy, fundic varices, and associated lesions of the stomach. Agreement was assessed using kappa statistics (kappa) and a quantitative score. The size of esophageal varices was significantly associated with their extent and the presence of red signs, whereas no relation was found either between gastropathy or mosaic pattern and fundic varices, or between esophageal and gastric features. Agreement between observers was good for the size of esophageal varices (kappa = 0.59), the presence of red signs (kappa = 0.60), and of gastric-associated lesions (kappa = 0.68) and gastropathy (kappa = 0.50), while it was poor for the extent (kappa = 0.37) and the color (kappa = 0.28) of esophageal varices as well as for the mosaic pattern (kappa = 0.38). The Child-Pugh score significantly increased along with the presence or the size of esophageal varices as well as with the presence of red signs; no relationship could be shown between this score and the presence of gastric features. We conclude that (1) interobserver agreement was good for the main endoscopic features, especially for the size and the red signs of esophageal varices; (2) esophageal patterns were significantly associated between themselves and related to hepatic dysfunction; and (3) gastric patterns were related neither to esophageal features nor to hepatic dysfunction and were not associated between themselves.\r"

  ".W": "To test the effect in rodents of chronic ingestion of a bile acid resistant to deconjugation, cholylsarcosine was synthesized and its transport, metabolism, and effect on biliary bile acid and biliary lipid composition were determined in rabbits, hamsters, and rats. Cholylsarcosine was shown to be well absorbed from the ileum but underwent little absorption from the jejunum or colon. When cholylsarcosine was administered in the diet at 140 mumol/kg.day, it was well absorbed and underwent little biotransformation during enterohepatic cycling; however, both bacterial deconjugation and dehydroxylation (without deconjugation) occurred to a small extent. With chronic feeding, cholylsarcosine accumulated to compose 24%-29% of circulating bile acids in all 3 rodent species. It was rapidly lost from the enterohepatic circulation, with a daily fractional turnover rate of 75%-150%, depending on the species. Cholylsarcosine caused no change in liver tests or hepatic morphology and did not influence biliary lipid secretion. When cholyltaurine was fed, it was also absorbed, but, in contrast to cholylsarcosine, was rapidly deconjugated and dehydroxylated to form deoxycholic acid. The deoxycholic acid accumulated in the enterohepatic circulation, as evidenced by a slow fractional turnover rate of 26%-40% per day, depending on the species. It is concluded that cholylsarcosine is absorbed from the ileum, has an enterohepatic circulation, does not undergo appreciable deconjugation or dehydroxylation in these rodents, and is nontoxic. In the rodent, the circulating bile acids can be somewhat enriched when a bile acid resistant to deconjugation is ingested; but the effect on the steady state biliary bile acid composition is less than that obtained when cholyltaurine is administered because cholyltaurine is biotransformed to deoxycholic acid, which in turn is absorbed and has its own efficient enterohepatic circulation.\r"

In normal liver, moderate amounts of alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) procollagen RNA were found in nonparenchymal cells, while alpha 1(IV) procollagen gene expression was at the threshold of detection. Following bile duct obstruction, increasing amounts of alpha 2(I), alpha 1(III), and alpha 1(IV) procollagen gene transcripts were observed in cells of the expanding portal tracts and in perisinusoidal cells in areas of excessive collagen deposition. Procollagen gene expressing perisinusoidal cells were colocalized with desmin-immunoreactive cells, suggesting that Ito cells and transitional cells were among the collagen-expressing cell types. Only alpha 1(IV) procollagen transcripts were found in epithelial cells of newly formed bile ducts.

To test this hypothesis we studied the effects of an alcohol solution and a glucose solution and compared them with those of alcoholic beverages on postprandial pancreatic secretion and release of gastrin, trypsin, and cholecystokinin in 6 healthy nonalcoholic male volunteers. Pancreatic enzyme secretion was measured in duodenal aspirate, plasma trypsin, and gastrin by radioimmunoassay and cholecystokinin by bioassay. The meal plus glucose significantly stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion, release of gastrin and cholecystokinin, and caused no changes in plasma trypsin. The alcohol solution and all beverages added to the meal caused similar increases in alcohol blood levels and significantly less pancreatic enzyme secretion compared with the meal plus glucose. Plasma trypsin levels remained unchanged. Compared with the meal plus glucose, wine and beer caused a significantly higher release of gastrin, and beer also released significantly more cholecystokinin. Inhibition of pancreatic enzyme secretion stimulated by a meal in nonalcoholics is a common effect of alcohol and alcoholic beverages despite some differences on release of gastrointestinal peptides. This effect may have some implications in the pathogenesis of alcoholic pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Common features of chronic alcoholic liver disease are progressive hypoalbuminemia and a spectrum of liver fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms that account for these effects are still the subject of controversy. Therefore, in the present study we evaluated albumin and collagen gene expression in livers of alcohol abusers and patients with virus-induced liver disease. Albumin and pro alpha 1(I) collagen messenger RNA levels were determined in 30 patients who underwent diagnostic liver biopsy. Of 14 alcoholics, 7 had alcoholic hepatitis alone and the other 7 had cirrhosis plus alcoholic hepatitis. Of 16 nonalcoholic patients with chronic viral infection, 6 had chronic active hepatitis and 10 had cirrhosis plus chronic active hepatitis. Total RNA was extracted from a portion of each biopsy specimen, hybridized with a human albumin or collagen complementary DNA clone, and compared with 2 normal surgical specimens, which served as controls. The Northern hybridization studies showed that (a) despite the presence of inflammation and fibrosis, the albumin messenger RNA levels of alcoholics were similar to those of the controls; (b) these alcoholics had significantly higher levels of albumin messenger RNA than did patients with similar histological levels of disease due to viral infection; and (c) all the categories of patients had markedly increased procollagen messenger RNA levels compared with controls. Given these results it is tempting to speculate that alcohol may actually increase albumin messenger RNA content in humans as it does in animals. Furthermore, the increased procollagen messenger RNA levels in fibrotic livers suggest that an increase in collagen syntheses may be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate a possible role of free radical production by xanthine oxidase in the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation, chow-fed rats were given ethanol (5 g/kg) and placed at 32 degrees C for 6 h, which resulted in increased hepatic malondialdehyde levels. Pretreatment with allopurinol in amounts that effectively inhibited xanthine metabolism also significantly decreased ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation, suggesting participation of free radicals produced by xanthine oxidase in the peroxidative process. Both acetaldehyde and purine can serve as substrates for xanthine oxidase. Pretreatment with cyanamide increased hepatic acetaldehyde levels 5-fold, yet this was associated with a decrease in lipid peroxidation, indicating that acetaldehyde is not the xanthine oxidase substrate involved. By contrast, ethanol increased hepatic contents of hypoxanthine and xanthine and enhanced urinary output of allantoin (a final product of xanthine metabolism), incriminating increased metabolism of purines. Ethanol administration also enhanced hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form). A corresponding rise of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) in vitro inhibited xanthine dehydrogenase activity by 60%-76%. Increased purine degradation, possibly associated with a shift from the dehydrogenase to the xanthine oxidase pathway (secondary to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [reduced form]-mediated inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase activity) is proposed as a possible mechanism for ethanol-stimulated free radical production. Because allopurinol attenuates the associated lipid peroxidation, this agent might be considered for possible therapeutic use in alcohol-induced liver damage.\r"

The muscarinic receptor subtype mediating acid secretion at the level of the parietal cell was unknown. Therefore, this study was performed to characterize muscarinic receptors on rat gastric parietal cells using the 3 subtype-selective antagonists hexahydrosiladifenidol and silahexocyclium, which have high affinity for glandular M3 subtypes, and AF-DX 116, which has high affinity to cardiac M2 receptors. The affinity of these antagonists was determined by radioligand binding experiments. In addition, their inhibitory potency on carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate production was investigated. Inhibition of carbachol-stimulated aminopyrine uptake was used as an indirect measure of proton production. Both M3 antagonists, hexahydrosiladifenidol and silahexocyclium, had nanomolar affinities for parietal cell muscarinic receptors and potently antagonized inositol phosphate production with nanomolar Ki values. Silahexocyclium similarly antagonized aminopyrine accumulation while hexahydrosiladifenidol behaved as a noncompetitive antagonist. AF-DX 116 was a low-affinity ligand and a weak competitive antagonist at parietal-cell muscarinic receptors. It was concluded that muscarinic M3 receptors mediate acid secretion probably by activation of the phosphoinositide second messenger system in rat gastric parietal cells.\r"

Active bile acid transport (expressed as picomoles taurocholate uptake per milligram brush-border membrane protein per 15 s, median and interquartile ranges indicated) did not differ significantly in 6 categories: irritable bowel syndrome (71, 35-97; n = 21), colon polyps (42, 30-89; n = 29), colitis (62, 33-91; n = 31), postvagotomy or postcholecystectomy (69, 37-97; n = 11), diarrhea without increased bile acid loss (58, 48-85; n = 12), and lack of gastrointestinal pathology (74, 45-103; n = 22). A decreased active bile acid transport was found in 3 categories: ileal disease (4, 1-36; n = 11), partial ileal resection (5, 1-35; n = 5), and constipation (41, 22-50; n = 8). Bile acid transport was increased in patients with bile acid-losing diarrhea with endoscopically and histologically normal ilea (111, 94-135; n = 8). These findings indicate that a low fecal bile acid loss, presumed to be present in constipated patients, is associated with a low Na+-dependent ileal bile acid transport and a high bile acid loss is associated with a high active bile acid transport. Ileal bile acid transport might be regulated by the availability of bile acids to the ileal enterocytes.\r"

As a result, measurable plasma gastrin increased from about 230 pg/ml in the controls to about 500 and 800 pg/ml in the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. The trophic effects of gastrin were reflected in increased stomach weight and oxyntic mucosal mass. Gastrin also increased the enterochromaffinlike cell density and associated parameters (histamine concentration and histidine decarboxylase activity) but was without demonstrable effects on other parts of the digestive tract and pancreas. The results show that continuous infusion of exogenous gastrin for 28 days induces trophic changes similar to those seen after a period of hypergastrinemia induced by treatment with effective inhibitors of acid secretion.\r"

The relative lipophilicity of polyethylene glycols 400 and 600 were examined by determining their partition coefficients (Kd) in water and organic solvents of increasing relative polarity. The Kd of polyethylene glycol 414 between hexane and water was 0.000015, indicating that there are only 1.5 parts of polyethylene glycol 414 in hexane for 100,000 parts of polyethylene glycol 414 in water. When the Kd was determined in organic solvents with increasing relative polarity or \"water character\", there was a linear increase in Kd. The relative urinary recovery of individual molecular weight fractions of polyethylene glycol 400 in normal volunteers was analyzed. After oral ingestion, there was a progressive decrease in relative urinary recovery of increasing molecular weight fractions of polyethylene glycol 400 suggesting that increase in the molecular size limited polyethylene glycol intestinal permeability. There was excellent correlation between the relative urinary recovery and the hydrophilicity of the intravenously administered polyethylene glycol 400 fractions. It is concluded that polyethylene glycols 400 and 600 are strongly hydrophilic. Since partitioning of polyethylene glycol into lipid phase is negligible in lipid/water mixtures, they are unlikely to be transported via lipid pathways. The intestinal permeability of polyethylene glycols are governed by their molecular size, and once in circulation their urinary excretion appears to be governed in part by their plasma or water solubility.\r"

The passive properties of the muscle, i.e., the development of passive tension and the optimal amount of stretch for active contractions, were unchanged by infection. Infection decreased the development of active resting tension, spontaneous contractions, muscle contraction to muscarinic receptor activation, and direct electrical stimulation. Relaxation to beta-adrenergic stimulation was also decreased in tissues from infected animals. Response to cholinergic stimulation, spontaneous contractions, and active resting tension were completely dependent on extracellular calcium. The dominant response to electrical stimulation of intrinsic nerves was relaxation in control tissue and contraction in tissue from infected rats. In the presence of atropine, all tissues from control rats but only 33% of the tissues from infected rats relaxed, suggesting a marked difference in functional inhibitory innervation. The inflammation may have either decreased the circular muscle responsiveness to the inhibitory transmitter or decreased the release of this transmitter. Thus, a nematode infection produces decreased responsiveness of the intestinal circular muscle to both contracting and relaxing stimuli and causes a reduction in functional inhibitory innervation in this layer. These changes suggest mechanisms for the reduction of intestinal transit observed after some nematode infections.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of liquid versus solid diet on human colonic transit were investigated, and transit following cecal instillation of tracer was compared with transit following instillation in the proximal jejunum. In a randomized cross-over, single-blind fashion, 6 normal volunteers ingesting either normal solid foods or a liquid diet were studied using colonic transit scintigraphy. 111In-DTPA was instilled either into the cecum via a long intestinal tube or into the proximal jejunum via a feeding tube. Compared with the liquid diet, the solid diet slowed transit in the cecum and ascending colon (p less than 0.025) and delayed progression of the geometric center (p less than 0.05) during the first 4 h of the study. Transit from 18 to 48 h was similar on the 2 diets. On the solid diet, transit was similar whether 111In-DTPA was instilled into the proximal jejunum or into the cecum. Transit from the terminal ileum to the cecum was assessed in an additional 5 volunteers following jejunal instillation of 99mTc-DTPA. Cecal filling was rapid (T1/2 = 0.49 h) and complete in all subjects before the onset of cecal emptying. These results suggest that colonic transit is slower on a solid than a liquid diet and that jejunal instillation of radiopharmaceuticals should be suitable for colonic transit studies in most subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Local capsaicin-sensitive sensory afferent neurons may regulate the ability of the gastric mucosa to withstand challenge. Since opioids can modulate the activity of afferent neurones by actions at peripheral sites, the effects of morphine on gastric mucosal damage has been investigated in the rat. Morphine (3-9 mg.kg-1 i.v.) dose-dependently augmented the damage induced by a 5-min intragastric challenge with ethanol (25%-100%), as assessed by macroscopic and histological evaluation. These effects of morphine were significantly inhibited by the opioid antagonists naloxone and the peripherally acting N-methylnalorphine. Pretreatment of rats with capsaicin 2 weeks before the study to induce functional ablation of primary afferent neurons likewise significantly augmented the damage induced by ethanol. Both morphine administration and capsaicin pretreatment substantially augmented histologically assessed damage to the glandular mucosa and enhanced deep hemorrhagic damage following challenge with the low ethanol concentrations, with the appearance of macroscopically distinct antral damage. The enhanced damage induced by 50% ethanol in capsaicin-pretreated rats was not further enhanced by morphine administration, suggesting actions on a common mechanism. These findings support a pathophysiological role for activation of local opioid-sensitive afferent neurons in the modulation of mucosal injury following challenge.\r"

During a 1-h incubation, vitamin E was transferred to Caco-2 cells only in the presence of triglyceride hydrolysis by bile activated lipase and not by lipoprotein lipase. Incubation with either lipase resulted in hydrolysis of approximately 20% of the medium [3H]-triolein to free fatty acids and a 3-5-fold increase in cellular radioactivity. In the absence of lipases but the presence of taurocholate, addition of oleic acid in an amount equal to the molar concentration of triglyceride (5.7 mM) to triglyceride emulsions containing either alpha-tocopherol or cholesteryl ester resulted in an increase in cellular [3H]-triglyceride and alpha-tocopherol or cholesteryl ester. We suggest that the absorption of hydrophobic molecules such as vitamin E may occur in the presence of bile and amphipathic lipids via the uptake of micellar neutral lipids by the intestine.\r"

At the most recent follow-up, the limb-length discrepancy was one centimeter or less in all twenty patients.

  ".W": "We reviewed the results, after follow-up ranging from twenty-three months to six years, in thirty-four patients who were treated during childhood for hematogenous osteomyelitis of a major long bone complicated by sequestration of a portion of the diaphysis and by pseudarthrosis or segmental bone loss, or both. Of the thirty-four lesions, twenty-four were in the tibia, eight were in the femur, and two were in the humerus. In twenty-three patients (Group I), the infection was still active, while in the other eleven (Group II), it was quiescent at the time of admission to the hospital. In nine of the patients in Group I (four tibial and five femoral lesions), an involucrum bridged the osseous defect, indicating that the periosteal tube had not been destroyed. In these nine patients, sequestrectomy and debridement, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and prolonged immobilization in a plaster cast resulted in healing of the defect without recurrence of the infection. In the remaining fourteen patients (twelve tibial and two femoral lesions), there was no periosteal new-bone formation, and operative treatment consisted of two stages: the first, to resolve the infection, and the second, to heal the osseous defect with corticocancellous iliac grafts. In the eleven patients in Group II (eight tibial, one femoral, and two humeral lesions), there were no involucra. All of these patients were treated with cancellous bone grafts and prolonged immobilization. In twenty-two of the thirty-four patients (thirteen in Group I and nine in Group II), there were varying degrees of angular deformity at the pseudarthrosis, necessitating correction by manipulation when the plaster cast was applied postoperatively (ten patients), by fibular transposition (six patients), or by fibular osteotomy in addition to manipulation (six patients). Excluding complications specific to the fibular transfer procedure, the complications in the Group-I patients (six recurrent postoperative infections, one fracture of the graft, and one non-union of a fibular strut graft) were approximately as frequent as those in the Group-II patients (one failure of fusion and two fractures of the graft). Operative treatment resulted in healing of all but one tibial lesion, in a patient who nonetheless had good function at follow-up. Of the seven limb-length discrepancies of 2.8 centimeters or more, by the latest follow-up two had been treated uneventfully: one by femoral and the other by tibial lengthening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We recorded the time to incorporation of the graft, the amount of migration of the socket in the superior and medial axes, and the percentage of graft remaining at the time of the most recent follow-up. The time to healing was similar for all categories of grafts. The central, contained, solid grafts had less resorption than did the central, contained, crushed-bone grafts, as evidenced by less migration of the socket during follow-up. The non-contained grafts, in both peripheral and central locations, were associated with high rates of migration and of instability of the socket.\r"

At the time of this study, 80 per cent of the living patients had no pain, and 152 of the 160 hips remained much better than before the operation. Kaplan-Meier analysis of probable loosening of one or both components, on the basis of roentgenographic evidence, demonstrated a probability of loosening of 3 per cent incidence at one year after operation, 13 per cent at five years, 19 per cent at ten years, and 32 per cent at fifteen years. The probability of failure (that is, revision or symptomatic loosening) was 0.9 per cent at one year, 4.1 per cent at five years, 8.9 per cent at ten years, and 12.7 per cent at fifteen years. We did not identify a dramatic increase in the incidence of loosening or failure at any of the follow-up periods (one, five, ten, or fifteen years). With the Mayo Clinic clinical and roentgenographic system for scoring the hips, we found that ninety-seven hips had a good or excellent result; fifteen, a fair result; and thirteen, a poor result. (The scoring could not be completed for forty-one hips). The functional results deteriorated slightly over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between 1980 and 1987, twenty-one patients who had a displaced fracture of the body of the tarsal navicular were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. A classification system was devised on the basis of the direction of the fracture line, the pattern of disruption of the surrounding joints, and the direction of displacement of the foot. In a Type-1 injury, the fracture line is in the coronal plane and there is no angulation of the fore part of the foot. In a Type-2 fracture, the primary fracture line is dorsal-lateral to plantar-medial, and the major fragment and the fore part of the foot are displaced medially. In a Type-3 injury, there is a comminuted fracture in the sagittal plane of the body of the tarsal navicular, and the fore part of the foot is laterally displaced. Satisfactory reduction, which was defined as restoration of more than 60 per cent of the joint surface in the anteroposterior and lateral planes, was achieved in all Type-1 injuries, 67 per cent of the Type-2 fractures, and 50 per cent of the Type-3 fractures. Radiographic evidence of healing was seen at an average of 8.5 weeks after injury. At an average follow-up of forty-four months (range, twelve to 106 months), a good result was noted in fourteen patients (67 per cent); a fair result, in four (19 per cent); and a poor result, in three (14 per cent). Both the type of fracture and the accuracy of the operative reduction directly correlated with the final clinical outcome.\r"

At operation, the major cause of the restricted glenohumeral movement was found to be contracture of the coracohumeral ligament and rotator interval. Release of the contracted structures relieved pain and restored motion of the shoulder in all patients. Histological study showed fibrosis, hyalinization, and fibrinoid degeneration in the contracted connective tissues, as well as fibrosis of the subsynovial tissue and an absence of the synovial cell layer on the joint side of the rotator interval. The contracture of the coracohumeral ligament and rotator interval appears to be the main lesion in chronic adhesive capsulitis. Resection of these structures, combined with appropriate exercise, will relieve pain and restore motion to the shoulder.\r"

The patients ranged in age from forty-two to eighty-nine years. All but one patient had at least one serious associated disease. Eight patients had had an injection or aspiration of the shoulder before development of the infection. All but one patient had had a delay in diagnosis. At the time of admission to the hospital, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was always elevated, but the body temperature and white blood-cell count were not. After treatment, the functional result was usually poor: only five patients regained forward flexion to 90 degrees or more, eight patients had no active motion of the glenohumeral joint, and two patients died. Arthrotomy appeared to afford a better result than did repeated aspiration.\r"

In five children, it revealed adhesion of the capsule to the ilium, an inverted limbus, and a displaced transverse ligament; these findings indicated a need for open reduction. In the other two children, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the capsule was redundant and appeared to have been stripped from the posterosuperior part of the acetabular rim; this allowed closed reduction. Repeat magnetic-resonance imaging in these two hips suggested that the capsule gradually shrank after several months. The findings in these two patients suggested a long-standing Grade-I congenital dislocation of the hip, as described by Dunn and by Ogden. Children who have this type of congenital dislocation can be treated with closed reduction, provided there is prolonged immobilization of the hip.\r"

Unfractionated peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes) and surface-adherent cells (monocyte-enriched) were prepared from control subjects who did and did not have clinical evidence of osteoarthrosis and from patients who had osteoarthrosis and were having a revision for failure of a cemented hip or knee implant. Cells were cultured for varying periods in the presence and absence of nonpolymerized methacrylate (one to two-micrometer spherules), pulverized polymerized material, or culture chambers that were pre-coated with polymerized cement. Conditioned media that were derived from both methacrylate-stimulated cell populations were shown to contain specific bone-resorbing mediators (interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, or prostaglandin E2) and to directly affect bone resorption in 45Ca-labeled murine limb-bone assays.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of IL-3 gene induction in human peripheral blood T cells was studied. IL-3 gene expression was inducible by crosslinking of the T cell receptor/CD3 complex using anti-CD3 MAb G19-4. Anti-CD3-induced IL-3 gene expression was found to be limited to the CD28+ T cell subset and could be augmented by costimulating T lymphocytes with antibodies directed against CD28. IL-3 expression could also be induced by costimulation of T cells with both phorbol ester and ionomycin, which are thought to mimic the intracellular effects of T cell receptor-antigen interaction. However, unlike other lymphokines such as IL-2 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3 gene expression is not induced by stimulation of cells with phorbol myristate acetate and anti-CD28. We conclude that IL-3 gene regulation is under stringent control since IL-3 gene expression occurs only in the CD28+ subset of T cells, and since IL-3 induction obligately requires increased intracellular calcium.\r"

In this report we examine the macrophage ACAT reactivity of the shellfish sterol, desmosterol, and other sterols found in man because of shellfish ingestion or in association with the foam cell diseases sitosterolemia and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). We first show that the J774 macrophage, a foam cell model with a hyperactive ACAT pathway, synthesizes desmosterol instead of cholesterol and that both endogenous and exogenous desmosterol are substrates and stimulators of the ACAT reaction in these cells. When exogenous desmosterol was added to human monocyte-derived macrophages, ACAT was stimulated 29- and 4-fold compared with control and cholesterol-treated cells, respectively. Steryl ester mass accumulation in desmosterol-treated human macrophages was 10-fold greater than in control cells and 3-fold greater than in cholesterol-treated cells. Another shellfish sterol, 24-methylene cholesterol, also stimulated ACAT in human macrophages, but most of the xanthomatosis-related sterols did not stimulate ACAT. These data suggest that: (a) the shellfish sterols desmosterol and 24-methylene cholesterol may be atherogenic; and (b) the excessive foam cell formation seen in sitosterolemia and CTX cannot be explained by ACAT hyperreactivity of their associated sterols.\r"

The twin study revealed predominantly genetic control (H2(1) = 0.95). Variability was markedly less within MZ (intrapair variance = 0.25) than DZ twins (intrapair variance = 6.33). In 100 unrelated male subjects the extent of interindividual variation was 11-fold. Unimodal distribution of values among 99 subjects encompassed a sixfold range. One outlier with very high activity clearly stood apart. Using the whole distribution curve we phenotyped members of six families. In the outlier's family, analysis of three generations suggested autosomal dominant transmission of high cEH activity. Analysis of the other 5 families and of 12 sets of twins, all from the large unimodal distribution, was consistent with either monogenic or polygenic control of variations within this mode. Several temporal host factors, including fever, the menstrual cycle, a 24-h fast, and diurnal variations, were investigated. Fever and fasting elevated cEH activity. Diurnal variations produced no observable alteration. During the menstrual cycle irregular fluctuations occurred.\r"

Renal cell regeneration, as reflected by incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine within the kidney, began between 24 to 48 h and reached a peak at 72 h after renal ischemia. As demonstrated by histoautoradiography, renal thymidine incorporation was essentially confined to tubule cells. Morphometric analysis of histoautoradiograph sections of renal tissue demonstrated that the majority of labeled cells were found in renal cortex, but some labeled cells were also located in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, suggesting that injury to medullary thick ascending limbs also occurs in this ischemic model. Exogenous EGF administration produced increases in renal thymidine incorporation compared with non-treated animals at 24, 48, and 72 h after ischemic injury. This accelerated DNA replicative process was associated with significantly lower peak blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels, averaging 63 +/- 20 and 3.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dl in EGF-treated ischemic rats compared with 149 +/- 20 and 5.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, respectively, in nontreated ischemic rats, and was also associated with a return to near normal BUN and serum creatinine levels in EGF-treated animals approximately 4 d earlier than that observed in nontreated animals. This report is the first demonstration that EGF accelerates the repair process of a visceral organ after an injurious insult.\r"

Among 24 cases of OTC deficiency previously examined, three unrelated individuals all showed loss of a Taq I site in the OTC gene corresponding to codon 109, suggesting that this Taq I site may be prone to mutation. Two of these patients demonstrated the same C----T transition (in antisense strand) converting Arg109 to Gln. Although these studies implied a strong association between the missense mutation and OTC-deficient phenotype, a causal relationship could not be firmly established. We have investigated this relationship by reconstructing the mutation in vitro. A full-length human OTC cDNA was cloned into an SV40-based expression vector and has been reproducibly expressed at high levels in the cell line Cos1. By site-directed mutagenesis of this wild type sequence, we constructed a missense mutation which contains the C----T transition. Electroporation and transient assay in Cos1 indicated that the specific activity of mutant OTC was 100-fold lower than that of wild type. This result confirms that the Taq I alteration leading to the Gln missense is responsible for the OTC deficiency affecting the above patients.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic lipocytes appear to be central to the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis, undergoing activation during inflammation to a matrix-producing, proliferative cell type. We have studied the activation process in culture by examining the response of lipocytes to conditioned medium from hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells). Lipocytes exposed to Kupffer cell medium (KCM) exhibited cellular and nuclear enlargement associated with up to a threefold increase in collagen and total protein synthesis per cell. Cell proliferation was also stimulated as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and direct cell counting. The latter effect was serum dependent and inhibited by antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Proliferation could be stimulated by recombinant PDGF, but only after preincubation of cells with KCM. These findings suggested that KCM was eliciting expression of the PDGF receptor in lipocytes, and this was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the PDGF receptor. DNA synthesis in lipocytes exposed to KCM occurred at 48 h, which reflected the time required for PDGF receptor expression (24 h) plus initiation of [3H]thymidine incorporation (24 h). These results indicate that KCM has multiple stimulatory effects on cultured lipocytes similar to activation of these cells observed in vivo.\r"

We explored the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and TGF-beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on DNA synthesis and growth of rat liver FSC. PDGF, EGF, TGF-alpha, and bFGF induced a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis with a peak effect at 24 h. PDGF produced the most striking effect with a maximum 18-fold increase over control. EGF, TGF-alpha, and bFGF elicited a maximum three- to fourfold increase in DNA synthesis. Analysis of growth curves revealed a similar pattern of potency of the growth factors. TGF-beta did not affect DNA synthesis of FSC; however, TGF-beta markedly potentiated the stimulatory effects of both EGF and PDGF. FSC showed high specific binding of 125I-PDGF and Scatchard analysis revealed high affinity receptors with an apparent Kd of 2.3 x 10(-10) M. Our data suggest that PDGF is a key mitogen for FSC and that the coordinate release of other growth factors together with PDGF by inflammatory cells represents a potent potential stimulus for FSC proliferation in conditions of chronic self-perpetuating liver inflammation.\r"

Previous studies have shown that both native and recombinant human MBP bind to wild-type virulent Salmonella montevideo that expresses a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide. Interaction with MBP results in opsonization and killing by phagocytes. In this report we show that low concentration of MBP (less than 10 micrograms/ml) markedly enhance complement deposition via the alternative complement pathway on S. montevideo. Despite structural similarities between MBP and the C1q subcomponent of the first complement component, MBP did not restore classical pathway activity to C1q-deficient serum, nor did it activate C1s when added to a mixture of C1r and C1s. In the presence of MBP the C3 bound to S. montevideo during incubation in serum was in the form of C3b and iC3b at a ratio of 1:2. Presensitization of S. montevideo with MBP rendered this normally serum resistant organism susceptible to complement-mediated killing. These results emphasize that MBP and complement cooperate in first line defense of the nonimmune host.\r"

We have previously shown that the transcription of type I procollagen and fibronectin genes in the lungs is preferentially elevated during the early stages of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (Raghow, R., S. Lurie, J. M. Seyer, and A. H. Kang. 1985, J. Clin. Invest. 76:1734-1739. Since a cytokine-like transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) that is capable of enhancing mesenchymal cell proliferation and ECM synthesis could be potentially involved in this process, we investigated the temporal relationship between the regulation of TGF beta gene transcription and cellular proliferation in the bleomycin-treated hamster lungs. We observed a transient 5-7-fold increase in the accumulation of TGF beta transcripts, a concomitant 3-4-fold elevation in the cellular proliferation, and 8-10-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis in these lungs; all three parameters peaked around day 10 after bleomycin administration. Based on these results, we conclude that regulation of TGF beta gene expression may contribute significantly to the early events that lead to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The biological action of glucocorticoids is dependent upon tissue-specific levels of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). During stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is stimulated, and high levels of glucocorticoids circulate. This axis is modulated by negative feedback by glucocorticoids, which inhibit hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion and downregulate GR gene expression. To study the developmental tissue-specific regulation of the GR, we measured the relative concentration of GR mRNA in fetal, neonatal, adult, and aged rats and examined the effects of dexamethasone on GR gene expression. Three different tissue-specific developmental patterns of GR mRNA accumulation were found. In addition, there was an age-dependent tissue-specific pattern in the feedback regulation of GR mRNA by glucocorticoids. In the fetus and neonate, GR mRNA abundance was not regulated by circulating glucocorticoids. The adult pattern of glucocorticoid feedback inhibition of GR mRNA expression appeared between 2 and 7 d of life in liver, and after 7 but before 14 d of age in brain. The GR was biologically active in the 2-d-old neonate, however, since dexamethasone enhanced gene expression of angiotensinogen, which is another glucocorticoid responsive gene. These data demonstrate that the GR gene is regulated by both developmental and tissue-specific factors, and provide another molecular basis for ontogenic variations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress.\r"

To determine a mechanism of the decreased effect of DA-1 agonists on sodium transport, DA-1 receptors in renal proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) were studied by radioligand binding and by adenylate cyclase (AC) determinations. Specific binding of 125I-SCH 23982 (defined by 10 microM SCH 23390, a DA-1 antagonist) was concentration dependent, saturable, and stereoselective. The dissociation constant, maximum receptor density, and DA-1 antagonist inhibition constant were similar in SHR and WKY. The apparent molecular weight of the DA-1 receptor determined by the photoaffinity D1 probe 125I-MAB was also similar in WKY and SHR. However, DA-1 agonists competed more effectively for specific 125I-SCH 23982 binding sites in WKY than in SHR. Basal as well as forskolin, parathyroid hormone, GTP and Gpp(NH)p-stimulated-AC activities were similar. In contrast DA-1 agonists (fenoldopam, SKF 38393, SND 911C12) stimulated AC activity to a lesser extent in SHR. GTP and Gpp(NH)p enhanced the ability of DA-1 agonists to stimulate AC activity in WKY but not in SHR. These data suggest a defect in the DA-1 receptor-second messenger coupling mechanism in the PCT of the SHR.\r"

Additionally, the luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptor was isolated by affinity chromatography (wheat germ agglutinin and LH-Sepharose) and also used as an antigen. In 7 of 14 patients with primary sterility and endometriosis a positive reaction was observed. Similarly, 6 of 16 patients with secondary sterility and endometriosis were also positive. Patients being stimulated for in vitro fertilization and presenting either primary or secondary sterility were positive in 5 of 22 and 6 of 16 cases, respectively. In the S80 test 41 of 60 sera presented IgG2 antibodies, whereas in the ST288 test 38 of 60 belonged to the IgG1 subclass. Kappa and lambda chains were equally distributed. Some patients could recognize the unoccupied LH/hCG receptor as an antigen, while others recognized only the complex formed by the hormone plus the hormone receptor. The S80 and ST288 antigens were isolated by affinity chromatography. Gel permeation of the purified antigens revealed in each case the presence of an antigen complex. The apparent molecular weight was between 2,000 and 36,000 D. Cross-reactivity studies using affinity-purified antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship of the membrane, soluble, and extractable fractions.

  ".W": "Our recent observation showed that angiotensin II (AII) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulate Ca2+-activated Cl- conductance in mesangial cells. These data raise the possibility that mesangial cell function may be modulated by extracellular chloride concentration [( Cl-]o). The present study was undertaken to test this possibility using cultured rat mesangial cells. When the [Cl-]o was reduced to zero, the percentage of mesangial cells showing contraction responding to AII and AVP was decreased from 72 +/- 9 to 33 +/- 10% and from 60 +/- 4 to 24 +/- 11%, respectively. Ca2+ transients induced by AII and AVP, measured in mesangial cells loaded with Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, were attenuated as [Cl-]o decreased. Also, when [Cl-]o decreased, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) levels of mesangial cells were suppressed, both in the presence and absence of AII or AVP. PGE2 production by mesangial cells increased when [Cl-]o decreased and the effects of ambient Cl- deprivation could be restored by addition of indomethacin to the Cl- -free medium. Moreover, PGE2 decreased mesangial cell contractility, Ca2+ transients, and IP3 production in response to AII and AVP. These data suggest that the decrease in [Cl-]o attenuates mesangial cell contraction by suppressing IP3 production and thus Ca2+ transients in response to AII and AVP through enhanced PGE2 production.\r"

Intratracheal instillation of IgG anti-bovine serum albumin (anti-BSA) followed by intravenous infusion of BSA results in acute alveolitis. Over the 4-h course of evolving lung injury, a 10-fold increase in TNF activity occurred in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections and BAL cells revealed that alveolar macrophages are the chief source of TNF. Antibodies that specifically neutralize rat TNF activity were raised in rabbits immunized with recombinant mouse TNF alpha. When administered into the lungs with anti-BSA, anti-TNF resulted in a marked reduction (up to 61%) in lung injury. Intratracheal instillation of exogenous TNF alone, or in combination with anti-BSA, resulted in an increase in lung injury compared to controls. Morphometric analysis and measurements of myeloperoxidase activities in whole lung extracts from rats treated with anti-TNF revealed a marked reduction in neutrophils compared to positive controls. The anti-TNF antibody preparation did not inhibit in vitro complement activation or diminish neutrophil chemotactic activity present in activated rat serum. These data indicate that intrapulmonary TNF activity is required for the full development of acute immune complex-triggered alveolitis, that alveolar macrophages are the primary source of this cytokine, and that TNF participates in the pathogenesis of immune complex alveolitis through a mechanism involving neutrophil recruitment.\r"

To further characterize this receptor, binding of the radiolabeled TXA2/PGH2 mimetic [125I]BOP to washed human platelets (WP) was investigated. [125I]BOP was competitively displaced from its platelet binding site by stable TXA2/PGH2 analogues. Competition curves were shallow with Hill coefficients of -0.73 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.001 different from unity) (90 +/- 1% specific binding). Scatchard plots were curvilinear and most consistent with two binding sites; a high-affinity site with Kd of 234 +/- 103 pM, Bmax of 0.7 +/- 0.3 pM/mg protein (180 +/- 87 sites/WP), and a lower affinity site with Kd of 2.31 +/- 0.86 nM, Bmax of 2.2 +/- 0.3 pM/mg protein (666 +/- 65 sites/WP). [125I]BOP association and dissociation kinetics gave a Kd of 157 pM without evidence of negative cooperativity. The EC50 for I-BOP-induced initial Ca2+ increase was 209 +/- 24 pM, shape change was 263 +/- 65 pM, and aggregation was 4.4 +/- 0.5 nM. Parallel binding studies using the TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist [125I]PTA-OH showed a single binding site. The rank order for TXA2/PGH2 analogues to displace [125I]PTA-OH was identical to that for [125I]BOP. These studies indicate that [125I]BOP binds to two distinct sites on human platelets that may represent platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor subtypes. The close correlation of IC50 values for I-BOP-induced platelet shape change and aggregation with the two Kds for [125I]BOP binding suggests that these platelet responses may be independently mediated by the two putative receptors.\r"

Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from 74 HIV+ patients and 70 HIV- control donors were tested for TH function when stimulated with influenza A virus (FLU), tetanus toxoid (TET), HLA alloantigens (ALLO), or PHA. Of the HIV+ patients, four different response patterns were observed: (a) patients who responded to all four stimuli (16%); (b) patients who were selectively unresponsive to FLU and TET, but responded to ALLO and PHA (54%); (c) patients who were unresponsive to FLU, TET, or ALLO, but responsive to PHA (16%); and (d) patients who failed to respond to any of these stimuli (14%). Our results indicate a time-dependent progression from a stage responsive to all four stimuli to a stage unresponsive to any of the stimuli tested, progressing in the order outlined above. The earliest TH defect is the loss of responses to FLU and TET, indicating a selective defect in CD4+ MHC self-restricted TH function. The later loss of ALLO and PHA IL-2 responses suggests more severe TH dysfunction involving both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. None of these patterns of TH unresponsiveness in asymptomatic HIV+ individuals were correlated with CD4+ cell numbers nor with Walter Reed staging criteria. This study indicates that the in vitro TH assay used can detect multiple stages of immune dysregulation early in the course of HIV infection and raises the possibility that staging of HIV+ patients should include in vitro TH functional analyses of the type described here.\r"

We hypothesized that if autoregulatory vasoconstriction is significant, then the increase in TPR produced by vasoconstrictor infusion will be greater when MAP is controlled at hypertensive values than when the increase in pressure is prevented by controlling MAP at the animal's normotensive value. Each drug was infused at a dose sufficient to increase MAP by 50%. Then, a constant rate of vasoconstrictor infusion was maintained while MAP was controlled at hypertensive or normotensive levels for 15-min periods using a gravity reservoir connected to the left common carotid artery. During AVP infusion, TPR was significantly greater when MAP was controlled at hypertensive than at normotensive values. This autoregulatory-mediated vasoconstriction accounted for approximately three-fourths of the increase in MAP produced by AVP. No significant autoregulatory component was identified for the increases in TPR and MAP produced by ANG II or NE. We conclude that systemic vascular autoregulation is a powerful physiological property that contributes to the hemodynamic response to pressor doses of AVP.\r"

Subjects with typical dysbetalipoproteinemia are homozygous for an amino acid substitution in apolipoprotein (apo-) E at residue 158 and have defective apo-E-mediated binding of both pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL to apo-B,E(LDL) (or LDL) receptors (1988. Chappell, D.A., J. Clin. Invest. 82:628-639). To understand the effect of substitutions in apo-E at sites other than residue 158, nine dysbetalipoproteinemic (dys-beta) subjects who were either homozygous or heterozygous for substitutions in apo-E at atypical sites were studied. These substitutions occurred at residue 142 (n = 6), 145 (n = 2), or 146 (n = 1) and are known to cause less defective binding than does the 158 substitution. The chemical composition and electrophoretic mobility of pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL from atypical and typical dys-beta subjects were indistinguishable. However, lipoproteins from atypical and typical dys-beta subjects differed in their affinity for the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor on cultured human fibroblasts. The pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL from atypical dys-beta subjects had 640- or 17-fold higher affinity, respectively, than did corresponding lipoproteins from typical dys-beta subjects. The higher binding affinity of lipoproteins from atypical dys-beta subjects was associated with a higher ratio of apo-E to total apo-C. Since higher binding affinity should cause more rapid receptor-mediated clearance of beta-VLDL in atypical than in typical dys-beta subjects in vivo, the mechanism of beta-VLDL accumulation may differ in these two groups.\r"

Continuous infusion of aldosterone for 7 d produced changes in four specific transport processes: induction of both active electrogenic, amiloride-sensitive sodium absorption and active electrogenic potassium secretion, enhancement of active electroneutral potassium absorption, and inhibition of electroneutral Na-Cl absorption, the predominant transport process in this epithelium. In contrast, continuous infusion of RU 28362 for 1-11 d produced a sustained increase in electroneutral Na-Cl absorption. This glucocorticoid receptor-specific agonist did not induce electrogenic sodium absorption nor affect either potassium absorption or secretion. These studies demonstrate that aldosterone (i.e., mineralocorticoid) and glucocorticoid receptors modulate separate and specific changes in active sodium and potassium transport. These results suggest that other glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) are not glucocorticoid receptor-specific and that their effects on electrogenic sodium absorption and potassium transport most likely represent the binding of these agonists to the aldosterone receptor.\r"

Synthase I was purified 1,118-fold to homogeneity by sequential gel permeation, hydrophobic interaction, and Superose-12 fast-protein liquid chromatographies. SDS-PAGE showed a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 26 kD and gel permeation chromatography indicated a molecular mass of 52 kD for the active enzyme. Homogeneous synthase I catalyzed ethyl ester synthesis at highest rates with unsaturated octadecanoic fatty acid substrates. The amino acid composition of synthase I was highly homologous to that of human myocardial major synthase, recently identified as an acidic glutathione (GSH) S-transferase. Antibody raised against homogeneous human heart major synthase cross-reacted with the 26-kD synthase I. FAEE synthase co-chromatographed with GSH S-transferase on DEAE cellulose, Sephadex G-100 and S-hexylglutathione agarose, and also displayed GSH S-transferase activity in catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with nitrobenzene-containing carcinogens. Thus, human myocardium contains a satellite peak of FAEE synthase activity and it is a neutral GSH S-transferase.\r"

Neither control nor Leu-Leu-OMe-treated DBA/2 donor spleen and bone marrow cells were found to induce lethal GVHD in B6D2F1 recipients. However, extensive colonic GVHD developed in B6D2F1 recipients of DBA/2 bone marrow and spleen cells. Enteropathic GVHD in DBA/2----B6D2F1 mice was reduced in severity after anti-L3T4 + C treatment of donor cells, and was eliminated by anti-Thy1.2 + C or the combination of anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt2 + C treatment of the donor cell inoculum. However, neither anti-Lyt2 + C, Leu-Leu-OMe, nor anti-Lyt2 + C and Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of donor cells significantly decreased severity of gut GVHD. Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of DBA/2 or B6 SpC was comparably effective in preventing in vitro or in vivo generation of B6D2F1-specific CTL. These findings, therefore, demonstrate that histologically severe enteropathic GVHD does not require participation of CTL and is not always associated with high mortality rates.\r"

Over one-half of all nephrons formed virtually no filtrate, while the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) of fluid-filled nephrons, measured at the glomerulotubular junction to preclude the possibility of covert tubular leakage, averaged one-sixth of control (P less than 0.001). Even that low mean value was elevated by a few nephrons with a near normal SNGFR. Renal failure thus reflected both total filtration failure in the majority of nephrons and massively reduced filtration in most of the remainder. Glomerular capillary pressure (Pg) averaged some 14 mmHg below control (P less than 0.001), whereas the arterial colloid osmotic and Bowman's space pressures were not significantly altered. Renocortical and whole kidney blood flow were also unchanged. Marked internephron functional heterogeneity precluded estimates of the ultrafiltration coefficient. However, the fall in SNGFR correlated well with the markedly depressed Pg and afferent net filtration pressure (delta PnetA, P less than 0.001), which in turn were caused by increased preglomerular resistance and a reciprocal fall in efferent arteriolar resistance. This complex change in intrarenal resistances was largely, if not entirely, responsible for failed filtration in this ARF model.\r"

  ".W": "In seeking to identify nucleating/antinucleating proteins involved in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones, a major acidic protein was isolated from each of 13 samples of cholesterol gallstones. After the stones were extracted with methyl t-butyl ether to remove cholesterol, and methanol to remove bile salts and other lipids, they were demineralized with EDTA. The extracts were desalted with Sephadex-G25, and the proteins separated by PAGE. A protein was isolated, of molecular weight below 10 kD, which included firmly-bound diazo-positive yellow pigments and contained 24% acidic, but only 7% basic amino acid residues. The presence of N-acetyl glucosamine suggested that this was a glycoprotein. This protein at concentrations as low as 2 micrograms/ml, but neither human serum albumin nor its complex with bilirubin, inhibited calcium carbonate precipitation from a supersaturated solution in vitro. This protein could be precipitated from 0.15 M NaCl solution by the addition of 0.5 M calcium chloride. Considering that cholesterol gallstones contain calcium and pigment at their centers, and that small acidic proteins are important regulators in other biomineralization systems, this protein seems likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CRH levels and ACTH responsiveness to synthetic CRH were also quantified in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Maternal plasma CRH levels, which increased progressively during pregnancy, correlated well with both ACTH and cortisol in early labor, delivery, and postpartum samples, and also with cortisol levels in samples before labor. CSF CRH levels in term pregnant women did not differ from those of nonpregnant women. CRH infusion that attained similar plasma CRH levels to those found in late pregnancy elicited significant ACTH release in vivo and regular CRH test provoked normal ACTH response during early pregnancy but no response during late pregnancy. We concluded that: (a) maternal pituitary-adrenal axis correlates well with plasma CRH levels, which are high enough to provoke ACTH release from maternal pituitary; (b) hypothalamic CRH secretion in term pregnant women is not exaggerated; and (c) maternal pituitary is responsive to synthetic CRH in early but not late pregnancy, suggesting that maternal pituitary-adrenal axis is already activated by high circulating CRH. Placental CRH may be an important stimulator of the maternal pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy.\r"

  ".U": "90078663\r", 
  ".W": "In cystic fibrosis (CF) phosphorylation-dependent activation of outwardly rectifying apical membrane Cl- channels is defective. To further understand regulation of this channel we examined several other mechanisms of channel activation in normal and CF cells. Previous studies have shown that strong membrane depolarization can activate channels in excised cell-free membrane patches. Here we show that such activation is dependent on both the absolute membrane voltage and the duration of depolarization. Moreover, activation was reversible by membrane hyperpolarization. In some cases, excising patches of membrane from the cell caused channel activation, even in the absence of depolarization. However, the frequency of channel activation with patch excision increased when bath temperature was increased from 23 to 37 degrees C. Although the channel remained in the activated state when temperature was reduced to 23 degrees C, subsequent hyperpolarization inactivated the channel. In cell-attached patches, neither depolarization nor increasing bath temperature to 37 degrees C activated channels, suggesting that neither is physiologically important in regulation of the channel. Thus changes in membrane voltage and bath temperature appear to cause a nonenzymatic change in the channel's conformation; the interactions between voltage and temperature suggest that they may affect the same process. To determine if a proteolytic alteration of the channel could also cause activation, we added trypsin to the cytosolic surface of excised membrane patches. Trypsin activated channels, which could not then be inactivated by either hyperpolarization or phosphorylation with PKC, suggesting that trypsin removed or altered a region of the channel involved in inactivation. All of these interventions activated Cl- channels from both normal and CF cells. Thus many aspects of Cl- channel activation are normal in CF; only phosphorylation-dependent activation is defective.\r"

  ".W": "Using a specific and very sensitive (1 pg = 1 U) bioassay, we investigated the presence of IL-6, a potent myeloma cell growth factor, in the sera of 131 subjects with plasma cell dyscrasias. 22 had monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), 13 had smoldering myeloma (SMM), 85 had overt multiple myeloma (MM), and 11 had plasma cell leukemia (PCL). Significant serum IL-6 levels were detected in only 3% of the MGUS/SMM group, but in 35% of the overt MM group and 100% of the PCL group. During overt MM, IL-6 was detected in 37% of the patients at diagnosis, 13% of those with stable MM, and 60% of those with fulminating disease. These data demonstrate that serum levels of IL-6, a potent myeloma cell growth factor in vitro, correlate with disease severity in plasma cell dyscrasias. Serial studies performed in 3 patients and correlative studies with labeling index in vivo in 25 patients have confirmed this concept. Taken together, this suggests that this cytokine is probably involved in vivo during the progressive phase of MM. Thus, anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies could be useful as therapeutic agents at this stage of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "A membrane-bound cytochrome b, a heterodimer formed by a 91-kD glycoprotein and a 22-kD polypeptide, is a critical component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase responsible for the generation of superoxide anion. Mutations in the gene for the 91-kD chain of this cytochrome result in the X-linked form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), in which phagocytes are unable to produce superoxide. Typically, there is a marked deficiency of the 91-kD subunit and the cytochrome spectrum is absent (X- CGD). In a variant form of CGD with X-linked inheritance, affected males have a normal visible absorbance spectrum of cytochrome b, yet fail to generate superoxide (X+ CGD). The size and abundance of the mRNA for the 91-kD subunit and its encoded protein were examined and appeared normal. To search for a putative mutation in the coding sequence of the 91-kD subunit gene, the corresponding RNA from an affected X+ male was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. A single nucleotide change, a C----A transversion, was identified that predicts a nonconservative Pro----His substitution at residue 415 of the encoded protein. Hybridization of amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes demonstrated the mutation to be specific to affected X+ males and the carrier state. These results strengthen the concept that all X-linked CGD relates to mutations affecting the expression or structure of the 91-kD cytochrome b subunit. The mechanism by which the Pro 415----His mutation renders the oxidase nonfunctional is unknown, but may involve an impaired interaction with other components of the oxidase.\r"

Monocyte-chemotactic activity was found predominantly in the defensin-containing fraction of the neutrophil granules. Purified preparations of each of the three human defensins (HNP-1, HNP-2, HNP-3) were then tested. HNP-1 demonstrated significant chemotactic activity for monocytes: Peak activity was seen at HNP-1 concentrations of 5 X 10(-9) M and was 49 +/- 20% (mean +/- SE, n = 9) of that elicited by 10(-8) M FMLP. HNP-2 (peak activity at 5 X 10(-9) M) was somewhat less active, yielding 19 +/- 10% (n = 11). HNP-3 failed to demonstrate chemotactic activity. Checkerboard analysis of monocyte response to HNP-1 and HNP-2 confirmed that their activity was chemotactic rather than chemokinetic. Neutrophils demonstrated a low level of response to defensins but this reaction was primarily chemokinetic. Defensins may play a role in the recruitment of monocytes by neutrophils into inflammatory sites.\r"

Apo(a) is a complex glycoprotein containing multiple Kringle domains, found to be highly homologous to plasminogen Kringle IV, and a single Kringle domain homologous to plasminogen Kringle V. Lp(a) levels appear to be inversely correlated with apo(a) size in a given individual. In this study, we have used probes specific to the Kringles IV and V domains of apo(a) cDNA in quantitative Southern blotting analysis. By this method, we have determined the ratio of Kringle IV/Kringle V encoding domains in the apo(a) gene of 53 unrelated individuals with different plasma concentrations of Lp(a). This ratio was found to be inversely correlated with log Lp(a) levels (r = -0.90, P less than 0.0001) and directly correlated with apo(a) apparent molecular weight (Mr) (r = 0.79, P less than 0.0001). In summary, by showing that Lp(a) concentrations and apo(a) apparent size are highly correlated with the ratio of Kringle IV/Kringle V encoding domains in the apo(a) gene, we provide a DNA marker for this atherosclerosis risk factor as well as an important insight into the genetic mechanism regulating Lp(a) levels.\r"

On occasion, they can metastasize.

Over the past 6 years, we have treated 17 patients with MFH (20 tumors) and 5 patients with AFX with Mohs micrographic surgery. A retrospective analysis of the surgical results is presented. To date (average 3-year follow-up), all patients contacted are tumor free with only one recurrence; no patient has developed metastatic disease. Our results to date are very encouraging; they lend support to Mohs micrographic surgery as a desired surgical approach for these difficult-to-cure neoplasms.\r"

Dentists are responsible for recognizing these lesions, especially the early lesions, providing dental treatment as appropriate, and for referring patients with AIDS for counseling and treatment that cannot be provided in their office. Early detection of KS is particularly important for patients receiving dental treatment. The dentist must be careful not to further compromise the patient's health by extensive or stressful dental treatment and to prevent intraoperative or postoperative complications. Early supportive and palliative care will improve the patient's prognosis. Dental care will help HIV-infected patients and those with AIDS to avoid caries and periodontal disease. In addition, regular dental care will enable the dentist in the early diagnosis of the disease's oral manifestations, such as candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, KS, or other oral opportunistic infection. Treatment of these conditions can significantly improve the patients' quality of life and their chances for survival. When universal precautions are used for infection control in the dental office there is no reason that comprehensive dental care cannot be provided for HIV infected patients--both for those that we know are infected and for those that are infected and we don't know about.\r"

Coronal mantle dentin is unaffected, resulting in an apparently normal clinical crown. An abnormality may not be suspected until radiographs reveal pulp and root changes. Orthodontic treatment can be a successful variation of the usual treatment offered to patients, and is discussed in this case report.\r"

Four instruments were used to survey active members of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) in Michigan. The survey was mailed to 1,408 dietitians; 738 responded (52.4%). The responding dietitians were predominantly under 40, well educated, and female, which was consistent with the 1986 national census of ADA members. The results indicated that dietitians hold positive attitudes toward older adults in most areas. An exception was that a majority of the dietitians perceived older adults as resistant to treatment. Although dietitians' knowledge about aging generally was adequate, the questionnaire revealed that dietitians lacked knowledge in the areas of economic and health status; dietitians answered that older adults have a lower income and are sicker and more institutionalized than is in fact true. These are critical areas of deficiency in knowledge by dietitians, since food and nutrition issues often involve money and health. In the problem-solving section of the study, the dietitians usually focused on one specific environment or area of concern. Neither the full range of all possible environments for older adults nor the diversity of older adults' needs was usually considered. Continuing education as well as comprehensive undergraduate courses on aging would have a positive influence on Michigan dietitians' attitudes and knowledge about aging.\r"

Data were collected from 165 randomly selected subjects by trained interviewers using face-to-face interviews. Nutritionist orientation was measured by a Traditional/Nontraditional Index (TNT Index) developed for the study. Nutrition knowledge and misinformation, supplement use, and sources of nutrition information were also investigated. Predictors of nontraditional nutritionist orientation were acceptance of nutrition misinformation and male sex (adjusted R2 = .09). For women, predictors of a similar orientation were acceptance of nutrition misinformation, low knowledge of general nutrition information, and low functional health status (adjusted R2 = .19). Mean nutrition knowledge scores were high, with a mean of 4.7 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.8) on a scale ranging from 4 (high) to 8 (low). However, many of the subjects did not list dairy foods (28%) and grains (27%) as necessary in the diet. In addition, belief in certain nutrition myths was widespread. More than 58% were taking one or more supplements (mean = 1.4 supplements per day, SD = 1.98). Physicians were mentioned as most likely sources of nutrition information, with dietitians and health food store personnel mentioned second, indicating the importance of marketing efforts for registered dietitians.\r"

Twenty-three vegetarian and 14 non-vegetarian elderly women (mean +/- standard error ages 72.2 +/- 1.3 and 71.1 +/- 1.4 years, respectively) were recruited on the basis of several selection criteria, including race, religion, education, geographic area, Quetelet index, self-reported absence of major chronic disease and use of medications, and physical activity. Average years +/- SE of adherence to dietary regimens were 47.0 +/- 2.9 and 71.2 +/- 1.4 in the vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups, respectively. Results from analysis of 7-day food records showed that vegetarians consumed significantly less cholesterol, saturated fatty acids, and caffeine but more carbohydrate, dietary fiber, magnesium, vitamins E and A, thiamin, pantothenic acid, copper, and manganese than non-vegetarians (p less than .05). On the basis of group means, 67% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance was met for all nutrients except zinc and vitamin D in both groups, and vitamins B-6, folacin, and vitamin E in the non-vegetarians. Compared with non-vegetarians, vegetarians had significantly lower serum glucose (5.18 +/- 0.11 vs. 4.65 +/- 0.09 mmol/L), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (4.08 +/- 0.25 vs. 3.34 +/- 0.19 mmol/L), and total cholesterol levels (6.46 +/- 0.27 vs. 5.62 +/- 0.21 mmol/L) (p less than .05). In summary, when healthy elderly vegetarian women were compared with closely matched non-vegetarian peers, the vegetarian diet was associated with improved nutrient intake and associated reductions in blood glucose and lipid levels.\r"

Even though the hospital diet served was adequate in energy and protein, 38% of the patients ingested less than 65% of their nutritional requirements, with a higher percentage of those with inadequate intake among the elderly than among the young (28% vs. 10%). Patients over 65 years of age ingested less energy and protein than those under 65 years of age (1,167 vs. 1,967 kcal, p less than .01; 47 vs. 78 gm, p less than .05). The gender of the patients had no influence on food intake. More than 60% of the medical patients, especially the elderly, had an inadequate intake of micronutrients: folate, 100% of the elderly vs. 93% of the young; zinc, 90% vs. 64%; magnesium, 90% vs. 36%; and vitamin B-6, 90% vs. 64%. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that age and body weight on admission were of predictive value in terms of subsequent nutrient intakes during the hospitalization. Patients who were over 65 years old and weighted less than 80% of their ideal body weight consumed significantly less energy and fewer macronutrients and micronutrients.\r"

One represented a high-poverty-area, all-black-student school and the other represented a middle-income-area school with a white to black student ratio of 3:1. Students were able to choose the required USDA minimal number of three foods, and 66% of the foods selected were similar at the two schools, demonstrating that a centralized menu was feasible. Three-fourths of the students were able to choose more than 75% of one-third of the RDA for all nutrients except pyridoxine and ascorbic acid at both schools and iron at the high-poverty school. Twenty-five percent or more of the students did not consume 75% of one-third the Recommended Dietary Allowance for thiamin, vitamin B-6, ascorbic acid, iron, and magnesium at either school or of niacin and vitamin A at the middle-income school. Overall plate waste was 12.9%, with younger children wasting more food than older children and more waste in the middle-income than the high-poverty school.

Index nutrients used were energy, protein, calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins A, B-6, and C. Two hundred ninety-five Massachusetts women, aged 14 to 43 years, participated in the field test of the questionnaire. A subset of 95 women provided three 24-hour diet recalls for use in comparative studies. Correlation coefficients between questionnaire and diet recall scores were adjusted for measurement error resulting from the limited number of 24-hour recalls per subject, and their confidence intervals were computed. When subjects with implausibly high energy scores (greater than 4,500/day) were removed from the sample, reducing sample size by about 15%, correlation coefficients increased substantially (25% to 64%) for all nutrients except vitamin A. Adjusted correlation coefficients exceeded 0.5, excluding vitamin A (r approximately 0.15), and quintile comparisons indicated that the questionnaire would correctly identify a high proportion of the women having low intake of selected nutrients. We conclude that a self-administered questionnaire can provide useful data about individual recent intake of selected nutrients in a majority of English-speaking, low-income pregnant women, but that overestimation of food use may occur among up to 20% of this population.\r"

Adequate research exists to support the following: The prevention of obesity in children and adults through nutrition and health education should be a primary objective for registered dietitians and other health care professionals. Optimal weight for individuals should be determined by considering health risks, heredity, age, sex, percentage body fat, and realistic goal-setting. Children should not be placed on restricted-calorie diets; rather, efforts should be made to encourage the child to be physically active, to eat a well-balanced diet, and to return to internal control of eating. Also, normalization of the feeding relationship between parent and child is important. Weight control programs should include behavioral management techniques for food intake, exercise, stress, and improved self-esteem. The programs should focus on loss of body fat and avoidance of repeated diet failures. Healthful behaviors that can prevent and reduce the incidence of obesity should be encouraged by registered dietitians and other health care providers, educators, the food industry, insurance companies, employers, school programs, and families. The concept of optimal weight may be modified as scientific evidence is accumulated on the determinants of body composition and weight, effective nutrition and health education approaches, and effective weight management strategies. Research is needed to permit development of more effective weight management strategies and programs for the overweight population.\r"

Directors with doctorates spent significantly less time in teaching (p less than .05) than those with master's degrees. Responsibilities of directors in the 22 submitted descriptions were organized into five categories: program management, curricular affairs, policies impacting on programs, student advisement and counseling, and academic activities. In the ADA Standards of Education, responsibilities of directors include program assessment, planning, and evaluation; in this study, those responsibilities were placed in the program management category. Exhibition of leadership qualities, revision of curriculum, and counseling and recruitment of students were responsibilities most frequently included in the position descriptions; however, those responsibilities were in categories other than program management. The responsibilities could serve as a guide for the development of a position description and as criteria for the role of a coordinated program director.\r"

The effect of the presence or absence of a diagnosis of major depression on functional status was examined in a group of 50 community-residing patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Patients were diagnosed as depressed (N = 20) or not (N = 30) according to DSM-III criteria. Cognitive status was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and functional status was assessed by family report of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). Consistent with previous reports, patients with a depression diagnosis were less cognitively impaired than their nondepressed counterparts. When cognitive status was controlled for, depression diagnosis was found to have a main effect on functional impairment. Although the direction of effects between depression and functional limitations was not determined here, these results suggest that alleviating depression may decrease functional limitations in DAT patients.\r"

  ".W": "This longitudinal study of glucose tolerance in the residents of a Jewish home for the aged (JHA) is now in its 25th year. Of 1,177 supposedly nondiabetic persons screened on admission from 1965 to 1986, 22.5% had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), reflecting its undiagnosed prevalence among the Jewish elderly in the community. The incidence of IGT was lower in 1969-1973, when the average age on admission was 77 years, than in 1982-1986, when the average age was 83.5 years. However, aging was not the only factor affecting glucose tolerance (GT). The rise in the residents' age in the last 10 years was not accompanied by an increased rate of deterioration of GT in the annual screenings of 1970-1984, suggesting that there was a delay in the effect of age on IGT and diabetes mellitus (DM). This was attributed mainly to the multimodal antidiabetic regimen (ADR) prevailing in the JHA in those years. Relaxation of this regimen was associated with a marked increase in the incidence of IGT and DM in the screenings of 1985-1987. When 25 newly diagnosed diabetics were put on a diabetic diet, 60% had normal or improved glucose tolerance tests (GTT) one to five years later. By contrast, in over half of the 80 residents whose first GTT did not indicate diabetes and whose diet was not as strictly controlled, the repeat GTT showed deterioration and was diabetic in 31%. Conclusions: Screening led to early diagnosis and institution of antidiabetic measures, probably avoiding or postponing the need for antidiabetic medication with its risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The consequences of aging of the immune system include impaired T-lymphocyte responsiveness and aberrant immunoglobulin production. Although T cells from elderly individuals have a well-described defect in lymphoblastic transformation in response to some polyclonal mitogens, immunoglobulin abnormalities have lacked a clear in vitro model. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 young and 13 old healthy donors were cultured with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Old-donor-cell phytohemagglutinin (PHA), but not PWM, cultures had significantly lower lymphoblastic transformation compared with young donor cultures. IgG, IgA, and IgM production tended to be lower in old- versus young-donor PWM cell cultures. By contrast, despite lower lymphoblastic transformation in old-donor PHA cell cultures, immunoglobulin production was higher for old- versus young-donor cell cultures. No significant age differences were present in initial lymphocyte counts, percent B cells, T cells or monocytes, or helper/suppressor ratios to explain this enhancement in immunoglobulin production. PHA-stimulated mononuclear cell cultures in the aged demonstrate not only a defect in proliferation but also increased immunoglobulin production. This in vitro system may be useful to characterize further the pathogenesis of altered immunoglobulin production in the elderly.\r"

The first group of older people received no intervention. Group 2 received a voice-mail message informing them of the cost, time, date, and location of an influenza vaccination clinic. Group 3 was exposed to posted and verbal announcements alone. Group 4 both received voice mail and was exposed to posted and verbal announcements. Vaccination adherence levels for groups 1 through 4 were 1.5%, 11.8%, 7.4%, and 37.5%, respectively. Voice mail significantly increased vaccination adherence either alone or in combination with posted and verbal announcements. These findings suggest that voice mail provides an inexpensive means of increasing influenza vaccination rates.\r"

The present recommendations for workup of patients with dementia includes some tests with only marginal benefits, and a more limited workup may be as effective. This case demonstrates how important it is to be sensitive as well to possible effects on family relationships of demented patients. When we evaluate and treat demented patients, the dependence of the demented patient on the caregiver and the emotional and physical stresses experienced by many caregivers make it important to consider the patient and caregiver as a system vulnerable to many potential risks.\r"

This paper addresses both an analysis of the examination and the relationship between performance on that examination and a group of characteristics of the examinees, collected as part of the registration process. The pass rate was 56%. Performance on the examination was positively correlated with scores on the general certifying examinations and with training in geriatric medicine. Data provided by the candidates in an addendum to the application were also available for analysis and were used to derive correlations with groups of questions. The performance of candidates was positively correlated with seeing large numbers of elderly in hospitals, nursing homes, or home settings, working in a University Hospital, teaching and research, and the size of the community in which the candidate practiced. Physicians from long-term care settings did exceptionally well. Working in a solo practice setting was negatively correlated with performance on the examination as was working in a for-profit setting.\r"

The hybridomas were used to detect hapten-bearing APC in draining lymph nodes of mice sensitized with trinitrochlorobenzene or FITC in vivo. Hapten-bearing APC capable of stimulating the hybridomas were detectable in draining lymph nodes of hapten-painted mice within 3 h after sensitization. The ability of lymph node APC to stimulate the hybridomas peaked at 24 h and declined by 48 h. The dendritic cell subpopulation was the subpopulation of cells that were found in the regional lymph nodes of hapten-painted animals that were capable of stimulating the hybridomas to produce IL-2. Prior treatment of the skin with low dose UVB irradiation before epicutaneous application of contact sensitizers significantly reduced the capacity of hapten-bearing APC to stimulate the hybridomas. This observation was corroborated by results obtained from flow microfluorometry analysis of lymph node cells from FITC-sensitized mice. Lymph node dendritic cells obtained from FITC-painted mice contain a brightly staining group of cells by flow microfluorometry analysis. Lymph node dendritic cells from FITC-painted, UVB-irradiated mice did not contain this brightly staining population. These results indicate that low dose, local UVB irradiation may affect APC migration and/or function. We believe that these hybridomas will prove to be useful tools in the study of the development and regulation of contact hypersensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the cytokine IL-4 on resting and activated human B cells were compared with the effects of known \"competence\" signals able to drive resting B cells into the cell cycle, including anti-Ig, PMA, anti-CD20, and a recently described competence signal, anti-Bgp95. In proliferation assays, IL-4 was costimulatory with anti-Ig and anti-Bgp95 but not with anti-CD20 or PMA. IL-4 alone triggered increases in expression of class II DR/DQ and CD40, but it did not trigger increases in intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i in resting B cells or induce resting B cells to leave G0 and enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Although IL-4 has some characteristics of competence signals, it was most effective if added to B cells up to 12 h after anti-Ig or anti-Bgp95 rather than before, and thus, in this respect, works more like a progression signal. Like IL-4, all four competence signals for B cells triggered increases in class II and CD40, but only IL-4 consistently induced increases in CD23 surface levels. IL-4 was costimulatory only with anti-Ig and anti-Bgp95, each of which can trigger increases in [Ca2+]i and new protein synthesis of the proto-oncogene c-myc, and can increase attachment of protein kinase C to the plasma membrane. IL-4 was not costimulatory with signals that 1) did not affect [Ca2+]i yet induced c-myc protein synthesis (anti-CD20), 2) only stimulated the translocation of protein kinase C (PMA), or 3) only stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i (calcium ionophore). These results suggest that resting human B cells require at least two intracytoplasmic signals before IL-4 can effectively promote B cell proliferation.\r"

Although PBL tested do not seem to exhibit substantial differences in the number of precursor T cells specific for these epitopes, APC from the same donors activate clone KT-2 specific for peptide 830-843 but not clone KT-30 specific for peptide 947-967. These APC express the proper restriction element because they can present the corresponding synthetic peptides. The failure to present a particular epitope might, however, be explained by the absence or presence of a protease(s) required for Ag presentation that may vary for different epitopes. Indeed, the protease inhibitor leupeptin was found to inhibit activation of KT-2 but not KT-30 T cell clone by the KK.35 B cell line normally capable of presenting either epitope. In summary, these data suggest that tetanus toxin processing and epitope formation by APC is distinct in different donors and for different epitopes.\r"

B10.A mice were primed s.c. with syngeneic spleen cells that had been pulsed with the peptide 81-104 derived from pigeon cytochrome c. The T cell response was measured by using a sensitive limiting dilution assay that measures lymphokine production. The precursor frequency of Ag-specific cells found in these mice was indistinguishable from the frequency found in mice primed in the footpads with 81-104 in CFA. A striking difference in antibody induction was found, however, when these two immunization regimens were compared. Mice primed with 81-104 in CFA developed significant serum antibody responses against the peptide, whereas mice primed with Ag-pulsed spleen cells produced no detectable anti-peptide antibodies. This lack of antibody did not result from detectable differences in the T cells that were primed: no differences were seen in IL-2 and IL-4 production or in the ability to provide help to B cells in vitro. In vitro stimulation with LPS suggested that the B cells were not primed by the Ag-pulsed spleen cells. The B cells were not tolerized, however, because boosting the mice with Ag in CFA resulted in the induction of an antibody response. The failure to induce an antibody response by priming with Ag-pulsed spleen cells was not caused by the site of immunization or the total amount of Ag used for priming. The critical variable may be the introduction of the Ag on the surface of an APC; in this form, B cell Ag recognition was apparently inefficient, whereas T cell Ag recognition was optimal.\r"

We have used the anti-Fc gamma R-bearing hybridoma cell lines (HC) as self directed targets for ADCC to analyse the triggering ability of each of the three defined Fc gamma R; Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII. Lymphocyte killing of the anti-Fc gamma RIII bearing HC (HC 3G8) was Ca++ dependent, but Mg++ independent. In contrast, monocytes and PMN killed the anti-Fc gamma RI- (HC 32) and the anti-Fc gamma RII- (HC IV.3) bearing HC in a Mg++-dependent, Ca++-independent fashion. In addition, freshly prepared monocytes were able to kill HC 3G8 in a Mg++-dependent, Ca++-independent fashion, indicating that low levels of Fc gamma RIII may be functionally detected on monocytes. Peritoneal macrophages were able to kill all three of the anti-Fc gamma R bearing HC in a Mg++-dependent, Ca++-independent fashion. Thus, the same target is lysed by myeloid cells in the presence of Mg++ without Ca++ and by lymphoid cells in the presence of Ca++ without Mg++. These results suggest that at least two distinct mechanisms of ADCC exist that depend on the type of effector cell mediating antibody-dependent killing and not necessarily on the Fc gamma R type triggered.\r"

  ".W": "Engaging AgR (surface Ig) on B lymphocytes leads to rapid inositol phosphate turnover and elevation of intracellular [Ca2+]. Continuous receptor occupancy (greater than 18 h) by anti-Ig leads to transit of most B lymphocytes from G0 to G1 stage of the cell cycle (blast transformation); a fraction of cells continue into S phase but do not proliferate continuously in the absence of growth factors. Prolonged exposure to ligand can induce receptor desensitization of some receptors. We therefore investigated whether such desensitization occurs in B cells activated by insolubilized anti-Ig. Resting B cells and anti-Ig-activated blasts were examined for their potential to elevate [Ca2+]i, maintain viability, and synthesize DNA in response to reexposure to anti-Ig. B cells and anti-Ig blasts had similar basal [Ca2+]i levels. Anti-Ig blasts retained the capacity to increase [Ca2+]i in response to anti-Ig; the magnitude of the increase was equal to or greater than that observed with resting B cells and occurred in more than 90% of cells. Isolated anti-Ig blasts subcultured in the presence of T cell-derived growth factors for 3 to 5 days responded to restimulation by anti-Ig with an increase in [Ca2+]i similar to that observed in freshly isolated blasts. The B cell and B lymphoblast ion channels were found to be permeable to Ca2+ but impermeable to Mn2+. Finally, blasts restimulated by anti-Ig retained viability and incorporated low levels of [3H]thymidine for 24 h. These results suggest that AgR on activated B lymphocytes can remain functionally coupled to intracellular signaling pathways and can participate in immune responses subsequent to initial activation.\r"

  ".W": "Upon antigenic stimulation with OVA-pulsed syngeneic macrophages, the mouse T cell hybridoma 231F1 produced glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF) having affinity for OVA and IgE-suppressive factors, whereas another T cell hybridoma, 12H5, cells produced OVA-binding glycosylation enhancing factor (GEF) and IgE-potentiating factor. The OVA-binding GIF from the 231F1 cells is an Ag-specific Ts cell factor, whereas OVA-binding GEF from the 12H5 cells is an Ag-specific augmenting factor. Both hybridomas express CD3 complex and functional TCR-alpha beta. Cross-linking of TCR-alpha beta or CD3 molecules on the hybridomas by anti-TCR-alpha beta mAb or anti-CD3 mAb and protein A resulted in the formation of the same factors as those obtained by the stimulation of the cells with OVA-pulsed syngeneic macrophages. It was also found that both the 231F1 cells and 12H5 cells formed IgE-binding factors upon incubation with H-2d and H-2b APC, respectively, with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 307-317 in the OVA molecules (P307-317). Six other synthetic peptides, including those containing the major immunogenic epitope, i.e., P323-339, failed to stimulate the hybridomas in the presence of APC. Indeed, all of the 10 T cell hybridoma clones, which could produce either OVA-binding GIF or OVA-binding GEF, responded to P307-317 and APC for the formation of IgE-binding factors. In contrast, GIF/GEF derived from six other hybridoma clones, whose TCR recognized P323-339 in the context of a MHC product, failed to bind to OVA-coupled Sepharose. The results indicate the correlation between the fine specificity of TCR and the affinity of GIF/GEF to the nominal Ag. The amino acid sequence of P307-317 suggested that TCR on the cell sources of Ag-binding factors are specific for an external structure of the Ag molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell hybridomas 231F1 and 12H5 constitutively secrete glycosylation-inhibiting factor (GIF) and glycosylation-enhancing factor (GEF), respectively, which lack affinity for OVA-coupled Sepharose. When the 231F1 and 12H5 cells were stimulated by OVA-pulsed syngeneic macrophages, however, GIF and GEF produced by the cells had affinity for OVA. Both the OVA-binding GIF from the 231F1 cells and OVA-binding GEF from the 12H5 cells bound to a mAb against TCR-alpha beta and a mAb against TCR-alpha, suggesting a serologic relationship between TCR and OVA-binding factors. However, the OVA-binding GIF and GEF bound to mAb 14-12 and 14-30, respectively. Because these mAb do not bind TcR alpha beta-chains, it appears that the Ag-binding factors are different from TCR itself. The OVA-binding factors from both 12H5 cells and 231F1 cells do not bind to urea-denatured OVA. The binding of the factors to OVA Sepharose was inhibited by a peptide corresponding to residues 307-317 (P307-317) in the native OVA, but not by the peptide corresponding to residues 323-339 (P323-339). Furthermore, the OVA-binding factors bound to P306-319-coupled Sepharose but not to P323-339-coupled Sepharose, and were recovered by elution of the former Sepharose at acid pH. The binding of OVA to anti-OVA antibodies was not inhibited by either peptide. Inasmuch as the 231F1 cells and 12H5 cells can be stimulated by P307-317 in the context of a MHC product, it appears that the Ag-binding factors and TCR-alpha beta on the cell sources of the factors may recognize the same epitope in the OVA molecules. The results also showed that Ag-binding factors and antibodies recognize distinct epitopes in the Ag molecules.\r"

Cultured, but not fresh, LC stimulated proliferation among autologous T cells, whereas fresh, but not cultured, LC proved to be superior at processing native OVA for presentation to an OVA peptide-specific, MHC-restricted T cell hybridoma. Cultured LC were also more effective at stimulating proliferation among allogeneic T cells. However, a significant, but difficult to quantify, component of lymphocyte activation in these assays was derived from the ability of cultured LC to stimulate autologous T cells. It has been proposed that the superior capacity of cultured LC to stimulate T cells in these assays is due to the \"immaturity\" of freshly prepared LC--which \"mature\" during the 72-h culture interval. Based on the observation that fresh LC are superior at processing native protein Ag, we would amend the currently held notion that there is a \"precursor-product\" relationship between fresh and cultured LC to include the fact that these populations are differentially equipped to carry out distinct physiologic functions and that fresh LC should not, therefore, be considered \"immature.\" We propose that fresh LC (in vitro equivalents of intraepidermal LC) can process native protein Ag with great efficiency, and can present these Ag in situ to memory and effector T cells (high affinity TCR interactions). Cultured LC (in vitro equivalents of LC that have migrated from skin to draining lymph node) exchange highly efficient Ag processing for acquisition of accessory molecules (surface ligands and secreted cytokines) that promote activation of unprimed T cells (including even low affinity TCR interactions).\r"

Northern blot analysis as well as in situ hybridization revealed that IL-6 mRNA was expressed in the cultured MC. Of urine samples from patients with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (PGN) 50% were found to contain significant IL-6 activity (ranging from 30 to 126 pg/ml). Urine samples from other type of primary glomerular diseases such as minimal change nephrotic syndrome or healthy volunteers contained no detectable IL-6 activity. Only 2 of 27 urine samples from membranous nephropathy contained detectable amount of IL-6. Furthermore, there was some relationship between the levels of urine IL-6 and the progressive stage of PGN. Finally, by immunohistochemical staining using an anti-IL-6 mAb, it was shown that MC in the affected glomeruli of PGN patients produced IL-6, whereas MC obtained from the patients with membranous nephropathy, minimal change nephrotic syndrome or normal kidney were not found to produce IL-6. These data suggest that deregulated production of IL-6 is involved in PGN and the measurement of urine IL-6 is helpful for the differential diagnosis of PGN as well as for monitoring the progression of PGN.\r"

PHA enhanced TNF receptor expression in J.Jhan cells and acted synergistically with TNF on HIV LTR induction. TNF was also shown to induce well expression of a whole HIV provirus genome transfected into J.Jhan cells. The use of various CAT constructs carrying fragments of the HIV LTR, combined with bandshift assays, showed that TNF stimulates HIV transcription by acting on the kB-like enhancer element of the LTR through induction and/or activation of an NF-kB-like protein factor. Such findings are compatible with the hypothesis that TNF production participates in the pathogenesis of AIDS by enhancing HIV replication in T lymphocytes.\r"

To identify the mechanism mediating this suppression, splenocytes were obtained from mice injected with CII or OVA and administered to recipients that were subsequently immunized with CII. Mice receiving cells from donors injected with CII had a lower incidence of arthritis and lower antibody titers than those receiving cells from OVA-injected donors. Treatment of cells with 3000 rad of gamma-irradiation abrogated the suppression. To determine the phenotype of these donor cells, spleen cells were fractionated by adherence to plates coated with mouse anti-IgG to enrich for Thy-1+ phenotype. Thy-1+ cells injected into naive mice could significantly suppress arthritis. Further depletion of T cell subsets by panning revealed that depletion of CD4+ cells prevented the transfer of suppression whereas removal of CD8+ cells had no effect. Isolated CD4+ cells transferred into naive mice were also suppressive. Recently the Pgp-1 (Ly-24) Ag has been described to identify a unique memory subset of CD4+ cells when present on the cell surface. In CII-tolerized spleen populations, removal of the Pgp-1+ (Ly-24) subset of T cells abrogated suppression and transfer of isolated Pgp-1+ cells suppressed arthritis. These findings indicate that the Pgp-1+ subset of CD4+ cells can suppress collagen-induced arthritis and suggest that a CD4+ memory cell down-regulates autoimmunity. In addition, treatment of donor animals with cyclosporin, which inhibits the development of CD4+ cells, abrogated suppression.\r"

When S. aureus Cowan I-activated normal B cells were separated into Tac-antigen (Tac-Ag)+ and Tac-Ag- cells by employing a rosette technique, IL-2 induced only the Tac-Ag+ cells to proliferate, whereas both the Tac-Ag+ and Tac-Ag- cells responded to BCGF. The Tac-Ag+ and Tac-Ag- fractions of activated SLE B cells behaved like respective fractions of activated normal B cells for the pattern of response to these growth factors. It should be pointed out, however, that although the Tac-Ag+ B cells of SLE patients and those of normal controls responded to IL-2 to almost the same degree, both the Tac-Ag+ and Tac-Ag- B cells of SLE patients exhibited markedly enhanced proliferative responses to BCGF. The selectively enhanced responsiveness of a broader range of activated SLE B cells may lead to B cell hyperactivity in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "One of the early events following growth factor exposure is elevation of intracellular pH, a process mediated by the Na+/H+ antiport. We studied the effects of human rIL-1 alpha (HrIL-1 alpha) on intracellular pH (pHi) and calcium ([Ca2+]i) in a murine T cell line (MD10 cells), which proliferates in response to IL-1 alone. By using the intracellularly trapped fluorescent dyes (2(1),7(1)-bis-2-carboxyethyl)-5(and -6) carboxyfluorescein) and indo-1, we monitored immediate to early changes of pHi and [Ca2+]i in response to HrIL-1 alpha. Exposure to HrIL-1 alpha (120 pM) leads to an early, sustained intracellular alkalinization (delta pH = + 0.09 +/- 0.03) that plateaus within 20 min. Lower concentrations of the monokine (12 pM, 1.2 pM) have a positive but not statistically significant effect on pHi. These effects parallel the degree of MD10 IL-1R saturation predicted by the KD (49 pM) as assessed by 125I-HrIL-1 alpha binding by MD10 cells (Bmax = approximately 1300). Both the MD10 IL-1 receptor KD and the HrIL-1 alpha concentration required to induce early measurable alkaline pH shifts, however, exceed by three orders of magnitude the HrIL-1 alpha ED50 (50 fM) required for MD10 proliferation. The IL-1-induced rise in pHi is both sodium dependent and amiloride sensitive, indicative of activation of the Na+/H+ antiport. Additionally, PMA (100 nM) and IL-2 (2 nM) alkalinize MD10 cells, with the rise in pHi as a result of PMA exceeding the maximal IL-1 effect (delta pH = + 0.13 +/- 0.04). Furthermore, although PMA alkalinizes cells previously exposed to HrIL-1 alpha, the monokine does not alter the pHi of PMA-treated MD10 cells. Importantly, intracellular alkalinization induced by either HrIL-1 alpha or PMA is inhibited by staurosporine (1 mu iM). Finally, HrIL-1 alpha does not change MD10 [Ca2+]i, in either an acute or sustained fashion. These results indicate that IL-1 activates the Na+/H+ antiport in T cells by a mechanism that is unrelated to changes in [Ca2+]i but may involve protein kinase C activation.\r"

Unactivated platelets express little IL-1 activity. The IL-1 activity expressed by activated platelets appears to be entirely associated with the platelet surface. No IL-1 activity was detected in supernatants derived from suspensions of activated platelets. A mAb specific for IL-1 beta inhibited 90% of the activity expressed by thrombin-activated platelets, whereas a mAb specific for IL-1 alpha inhibited approximately 20% of the activity. A control mAb was without an effect. These results indicate that activated platelets express surface-associated IL-1 activity. Platelet surface IL-1 may provide a mechanism for altering in an extremely localized and rapid manner the properties of IL-1 responsive cells with which platelets come in direct contact during processes of inflammation and vessel wall damage.\r"

  ".U": "90079005\r", 
  ".W": "IL-6 (formerly PCTGF, HP-1, BSF-2, HGF, IFN-beta 2, 26 kDa) is a recently defined lymphokine demonstrating activity on multiple cell types, including hepatocytes, thymocytes, T cells, plasmacytomas, and B cells. The biologic effects of IL-6 on lymphocytes, particularly B cells, suggest this factor may be involved in the regulation of normal immune responses. Accordingly, we have investigated the role of IL-6 in Ag-specific responses of B cells from both naive and Ag-primed mice. When Ag-primed splenic T cells were used as a source of help, naive (primary) B cell responses specific for the hemagglutinin molecule of the influenza A virus (PR8) were fully inhibited by the addition of an anti-IL-6 antiserum, and are thus IL-6 dependent. In contrast, secondary B cell responses were essentially IL-6 independent, being unaffected by this antiserum even at concentrations 10-fold higher than required to completely inhibit primary responses. This differential IL-6 requirement was further investigated by using a panel of hemagglutinin molecule-specific Th clones. Consistent with the above findings, a Th1 clone secreting biologically active IL-6 enables antibody secretion by both primary and secondary B cells, whereas Th1 clones that do not produce IL-6 support secondary responses, but fail to help primary B cell responses unless exogenous IL-6 is added. These results provide the first instance of differential lymphokine requirements among primary vs secondary B cell responses, and suggest T cell-derived IL-6 plays a critical role during the regulation of humoral immune responses. Moreover, functionally distinct Th1 clones were identified that differed in IL-6 secretion and their corresponding ability to induce Ig secretion by primary and secondary B cells.\r"

Specifically, IL-3 uniquely induces the transient expression of Thy-1 Ag on Thy-1- bone marrow cells during a 2-wk culture period. Thy-1 Ag is expressed on immature myeloid cells that are undergoing lineage restrictions to granulocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Flow microfluorimetry-separated Thy-1+ cells require the addition of IL-3 or granulocyte/macrophage-CSF to the culture medium for continued growth and, as these cells divide and undergo terminal differentiation they gradually lose Thy-1 Ag expression. The loss of Thy-1 expression is not strictly correlated with cellular proliferation since the expression of Thy-1 decreases on proliferating cells. Last, IL-3 does not maintain the Thy-1- stem cell population that can give rise to Thy-1+ cells in vitro. The relevance of this scheme of differentiation to normal hemopoiesis and to differentiation-arrested IL-3-dependent leukemic cell populations is discussed.\r"

A partial reduction in TNF activity was observed which could be restored by incubation with exogenous TNF.

Although the alpha-chain itself has been shown to be nonfunctional, suggestions have been made that the beta-chain mediates an IL-2 signal. To directly study the role of the beta-chain in the signal transduction, we transfected with the cDNA encoding the IL-2R beta-chain a human T lymphotropic virus-I-transformed T cell line, MT-1 originally expressing low-affinity alpha-chain alone, and established a stable transformant (designated MT-beta 7) which expressed both alpha- and beta-chains simultaneously. We showed 1) MT-beta 7 manifested the high-affinity IL-2 binding, which was completely disrupted by the anti-beta chain mAb (Mik-beta 1), 2) the 125I-IL-2 crosslinking patterns of MT-beta 7 were indistinguishable from those of cells expressing the native high-affinity IL-2R, 3) MT-beta 7, but not parental MT-1, internalized the bound IL-2 and responded to IL-2 with a negative signal, i.e., inhibition of the de novo DNA synthesis. These results clearly demonstrate that the beta-chain not only participates in forming the high-affinity IL-2R with the alpha-chain but also is directly involved in the IL-2 signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "The TCR/CD3 complex is a multimeric protein complex composed of a minimum of seven transmembrane chains (TCR alpha beta-CD3 gamma delta epsilon zeta 2). Whereas earlier studies have demonstrated that both the TCR-alpha and -beta chains are required for the cell surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex, the role of the CD3 chains for the TCR/CD3 expression have not been experimentally addressed in human T cells. In this study the function of the CD3-zeta chain for the assembly, intracellular processing, and expression of the TCR/CD3 complex in the human leukemic T cell line Jurkat was investigated. The results indicate that: 1) CD3-zeta is required for the cell surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex; 2) the pentameric form (TCR alpha beta-CD3 gamma delta epsilon) of the TCR/CD3 complex and single TCR chains associated with CD3 (TCR alpha-CD3 gamma delta epsilon and TCR beta-CD3 gamma delta epsilon) are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of CD3-zeta; 3) the CD3-zeta does not associate with TCR alpha-CD3 gamma delta epsilon or TCR beta-CD3 gamma delta epsilon complexes; 4) CD3-zeta associate with the pentameric form of the TCR/CD3 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum to form the heptameric complex (TCR alpha beta-CD3 gamma delta epsilon----TCR alpha beta-CD3 gamma delta epsilon 2); and 5) CD3-zeta is required for the export of the TCR/CD3 complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus for subsequent processing.\r"

This antibody reacted with DRw8 plus all other DR types except DR3 and DRw52. DR3 and DRw52 differ uniquely from other other DR antigens at position 77 in the beta 1-domain of their beta-chains where there is asparagine instead of threonine. In Western blots the antibody reacted with DR alpha/beta-dimer but not with free alpha- or beta-chains. Two-dimensional gel analysis of a DRw11, DRw52 cell line showed that TAL15.1 immunoprecipitated the DR products. Although it also coprecipitated the DQ beta chain products, flow microfluorimetric analysis with various transfectant cell lines showed that TAL15.1 failed to bind the DQ or DP products tested. We conclude that TAL15.1 is a DR-specific polymorphic antibody whose activity correlates with a specific residue. It has already proved to be a valuable reagent for distinguishing DR3 homozygotes from DR3, DRw6 heterozygotes, which have in the past been difficult to separate.\r"

The interaction between this peptide and HLA-A2 was explored by studying the CTL recognition of BNP 82-94 presented by mutant HLA-A2 molecules. Mutations at residues 9, 99, 70, 74, 152 and 156 were found to abolish T cell recognition of the BNP peptide.

The inhibitory effect of IVIg was dependent on interactions between the variable regions of IVIg and variable regions of the autoantibodies. Affinity chromatography of F(ab')2 fragments or of IgG containing anti-TG, anti-DNA, or anti-IF autoantibody activity on Sepharose-bound F(ab')2 from IVIg resulted in the specific retention of autoantibody activity, indicating that IVIg contain antiidiotypic antibodies against human autoantibodies. Inhibition of autoantibody activity by anti-Id in IVIg in vitro is dose dependent with maximal inhibition occurring at a specific molar ratio between patient's IgG and IVIg and shows a prozone phenomenon. The relative content in anti-Id against a particular autoantibody may differ between IVIg preparations. Affinity chromatography of IVIg on Sepharose-bound F(ab')2 fragments from IVIg also resulted in specific retention of anti-TG and anti-DNA activities that were found to be present in pooled normal immunoglobulins. The presence in IVIg of anti-Id against autoantibodies from patients and from normal individuals may provide a mechanism for the suppressive effect of IVIg in human autoimmune diseases and supports the concept of a functional idiotypic network regulating autoimmune responses in man.\r"

This mAb inhibited monocyte binding of both soluble FITC-labeled IgA and IgA-coated E, whereas it did not inhibit IgG binding. The Ag recognized by My 43 was induced on HL-60 cells in parallel with IgA binding ability by 1-25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 treatment. Phagocytosis of IgA-coated E by monocytes and 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated HL-60 cells was inhibited by My 43. Furthermore, a heteroantibody of My 43 x F(ab)'2 anti-E promoted phagocytic uptake of E by monocytes. Production of superoxide anion by IFN-gamma treated U-937 cells was stimulated by My 43 but not by other IgM mAb recognizing myeloid cells. By these criteria My 43 recognized a molecule capable of triggering function. Moreover, its binding reactivity, ability to block binding of IgA and IgA-complexes, and its ability to induce activation of IgA receptor bearing myeloid cells, are consistent with the possibility that My 43 reacts with the IgA receptor on these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Ingestion by phagocytes is known to be markedly enhanced by physiologic signals such as cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins which may be found in inflammatory sites. Little investigation has been made of mechanisms that may depress this increased rate of phagocytosis during resolution of inflammation. We show that adenosine can act as an inhibitor of phagocytosis by macrophages derived from in vitro culture of human peripheral blood monocytes. Adenosine (Ado) is equally effective at inhibiting IgG Fc and complement-mediated phagocytosis. However, Ado has no effect on phagocytosis by freshly isolated monocytes. Inhibition by Ado begins after 2 days in culture and reaches a plateau by 5 days; these kinetics of induction of inhibition of phagocytosis parallel an increase in specific Ado binding to the macrophage plasma membrane. Ado binds to cultured monocytes with a Kd of 6 microM. This affinity and the observation that 2-chloroadenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidadenosine are the most potent inhibitors of phagocytosis suggest that the Ado receptors expressed during monocyte differentiation are of the A2 type. The inhibition of phagocytosis may be mediated by cAMP, a second messenger coupled to A2 receptors in several cell types. Thus, plasma membrane expression of A2 receptors dramatically increases during monocyte differentiation in vitro. These data show that a potentially physiologic mediator can have very different effects on the function of monocytes and macrophages. This suggests a mechanism whereby phagocytic function at inflammatory sites can be down-regulated if and only if signals for the recruitment of new phagocytes have subsided.\r"

  ".W": "IL-2-independent CD8+ rat x BW5147 T cell hybridomas are highly sensitive to treatment with 10(-6) M dexamethasone. This glucocorticoid analog induces a rapid DNA fragmentation with a pattern similar to that observed during glucocorticoid-induced killing of mouse thymocytes, which suggests the activation of a similar specific endonuclease. Among these hybrids, we select variants expressing low affinity IL-2R, as measured by IL-2 binding assay and by the cell surface expression of the IL-2Rp55 Ag (rat CD25 recognized by OX-39 mAb). These OX-39+ IL-2 independent hybrids (named V type) are protected from the toxic action of dexamethasone by IL-2. The addition of IL-2 to V type cells induces the expression of a low number of high affinity IL-2R, which is strongly potentiated by the simultaneous addition of dexamethasone. Furthermore, dexamethasone is strongly synergistic with IL-2 in the induction of mRNA p55/IL-2R, which could be observed 6 h after the treatment. These data suggest that the utilization of the IL-2-R signaling pathway may induce an effective protection against glucocorticoid toxicity in mature T cells. Finally, we proved that the upregulation of IL-2R by IL-2 is strongly potentiated by glucocorticoids, which implies a new role for these agents in the immune system.\r"

These effects are most likely mediated through the interaction with a specific glucocorticoid receptor as suggested by the structure-activity relationship of the various steroids tested. Incubation of nuclei of glucocorticoid-untreated cells in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions induces the cleavage of DNA in the linker region between nucleosomes, suggesting that fragmentation of chromatin in intact cells by glucocorticoids may involve the activation of a preexisting endonuclease. Interestingly, the presence of a saturating dose of IL-2 during the treatment of CTLL-2 cells with glucocorticoids completely blocks the cell death program.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of human rIL-1 alpha in intact normal mice has positive and negative effects on myelopoiesis. Within 6 h postinjection, peripheral neutrophilia can be demonstrated. However, bone marrow and spleen cells capable of inhibiting CFU-granulocyte macrophage proliferation are detected between 6 and 48 h postinjection. These myelopoietic suppressor cells belong to the monocytic lineage and are identical to inhibitory cells induced by PGE2. Treatment of mice with indomethacin, a PG synthesis inhibitor, completely blocked the generation of IL-1-alpha-induced myelopoietic suppressor cells, and significantly enhanced femoral and splenic CFU-GM proliferation after a single injection of 0.4 microgram/mouse IL-1. The peripheral blood neutrophilia observed within 6 h after IL-1 injection was delayed to 18 to 24 h postinjection in indomethacin-pretreated mice. In mice treated with four consecutive daily injections of 0.4 microgram IL-1, a sustained peripheral neutrophilia was observed. IL-1 had little effect on femoral CFU-GM in these animals, however, splenic CFU-GM was increased 7- to 10-fold by 4 to 7 days postinjection. In IL-1 plus indomethacin-treated mice, sustained peripheral neutrophilia was observed although to a lesser degree than with IL-1 alone. Marrow CFU-GM were relatively unaffected, however, splenic CFU-GM were increased by 27-fold. These results indicate that the in vivo administration of IL-1 results in neutrophilia and generation of myelopoietic suppressive effects, mediated by cyclo-oxygenase pathway products. Blockade of PG synthesis by using the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin abrogates the myelopoietic suppressive effects associated with IL-1 administration and optimizes its myelopoietic stimulatory capacity. The inclusion of a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor may have significant relevance to the clinical use of IL-1.\r"

In this report, we demonstrate that the murine mast cell line PT18 and primary mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells chemotax to the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin, and that the synthetic laminin A chain-derived peptide, PA22-2, represents a region of laminin that contains a major chemoattractant site. Mast cell chemotaxis to laminin is enhanced after activation of mast cells by the calcium ionophore, A23187, or PMA and by sensitization of the cells with IgE followed by exposure to antigen. Chemotaxis is not increased in the presence of IL-3 and is independent of mast cell degranulation, as histamine release did not occur when cells were activated with PMA. Mast cell chemotaxis to laminin and its enhancement by IgE-dependent mast cell activation provides a mechanism by which these cells may be attracted to sites of tissue injury. Such activity may be particularly relevant in the response of host tissues to inflammation accompanying parasitic infestations, allergic reactions, and wound healing.\r"

The IgM mAb OVH bound to a repeating carbohydrate epitope present in adult, infective, and fourth stage larvae and microfilariae of B. malayi, and on the surface of fourth stage larvae. Ag bearing this epitope were also present in the sera of hosts infected with a variety of helminths, including Brugia, Onchocerca, Dirofilaria, and Paragonimus. Affinity chromatography of SDS extract of adult Brugia, using mAb OVH immobilized on agarose beads, isolated several Ag that separated into multiple protein staining bands on SDS-PAGE. In comparing SDS-PAGE-fractionated Ag from the crude SDS extract with fractionated mAb OVH-isolated Ag for the ability to protect BALB/c mice from challenge with B. malayi-infective larvae, it was found that of the mAb OVH-isolated Ag only those at a molecular mass of 26 to 32 kDa were protective while the original SDS extract yielded protective Ag at the following molecular mass: greater than 200, 170 to 200, 40 to 44, 33 to 36, 23 to 28, 20 to 22, and 17 to 19 kDa. Although Ag isolated by mAb OVH were highly protective, they failed to induce high antibody levels against the immunogen or SDS extracts compared to crude SDS extract immunized mouse sera, as determined by immunoblot and ELISA. Transfer of nylon wool non-adherent T cells from BALB/c mice immunized with the 26- to 28-kDa fraction of mAb OVH-isolated Ag to naive mice just before challenge with infective larvae of B. malayi resulted in a 70% reduction in larvae recovered 14 days after challenge.\r"

Macrophage-mediated larval killing was found to be arginine dependent, as indicated by inhibition in the presence of exogenous arginase or the competitive inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Culture supernatant fluids from the larvicidal LK-activated macrophages contained nitrite, a product of activated macrophages derived by oxidation of arginine and implicated in the antitumor and antimicrobial effector function of these cells. Nitrite was not detectable in supernatant fluids obtained from nonactivated macrophages or from macrophages stimulated with LK in the presence of arginase or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Addition of excess iron or the reductant sodium dithionite to LK-activated macrophage cultures also inhibited larval killing in vitro, under conditions that have been shown by others to stabilize the activity of iron-containing enzymes involved in respiration. Nitrite production was not decreased under these conditions. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that macrophage-mediated schistosomulum killing is caused, at least in part, by a mechanism proposed for tumor cytotoxicity, whereby production of reactive nitrogen intermediates triggers iron loss from critical target cell enzymes leading to lethal metabolic inhibition. In accordance, schistosomula were shown to be killed by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration.\r"

A recombinant clone producing a Mr 123,000 beta-galactosidase fusion protein was isolated. Antibodies affinity-purified on this fusion protein recognized a complex of three surface-oriented proteins of promastigotes of L. major of Mr 94,000, 90,000, and 80,000 that we have termed the promastigote surface Ag 2 (PSA-2) complex. The DNA sequence of the insert in this clone predicted the 3' end of an open reading frame encoding a hydrophobic C-terminus. The inferred C-terminal sequence was suggestive of a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol membrane anchoring mechanism. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment of the native PSA-2 proteins caused a shift in their electrophoretic mobility with an apparent reduction in the molecular weight of the PSA-2 complex. After phospholipase C treatment these proteins also displayed the cryptic cross-reacting determinant recognized by antibodies to the Trypanosoma brucei variant surface Ag. Moreover, PSA-2, which previously partitioned in the detergent phase after Triton X-114 phase separation, became water-soluble after phospholipase C treatment. Immunoprecipitation of the PSA-2 proteins with sera directed to lectin-binding proteins indicated that these polypeptides may be differentially glycosylated. Finally, these PSA-2 proteins were recognized by sera from some patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.\r"

In BALB/c mice, peptides corresponding to sequences 1-17, 70-82 and 189-199 generate T cell proliferative responses, induce the production of antibodies capable of neutralization of the toxin in the Chinese hamster ovary-cell assay, and protect mice from a shock-like syndrome caused by alternate injections of BSA and PT. Protection and neutralization correlated with the ability of these peptides to elicit high anti-PT titers. Different B cell epitopes were detected in other inbred mouse strains. The antibody reactivity against synthetic peptides from two infants vaccinated with pertussis vaccine was tested. These infants had antibodies reactive to a variety of epitopes in the S1 subunit, including peptides 1-17, 70-82, 99-112, 135-145, and 189-199. Thus, it appears that there are multiple T and B cell epitopes in the S1 subunit of PT.\r"

  ".W": "In rats persistently infected with Borna disease virus (BDV), severe neurologic disorders and occasional death are the consequences of a T cell-mediated immunopathologic reaction in the brain. It is shown here that the pathologic alterations in the brain and as a result, Borna Disease (BD) can be prevented if animals are treated with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CSA) under the following optimal conditions: greater than or equal to 25 mg/kg/day of CSA, started before infection and given for 4 wk. Rats treated with lower doses of CSA, for shorter periods or after infection displayed encephalitic lesions and developed BD. When CSA treatment was begun even as early as 1 day after infection, encephalitis and disease were not influenced. Immune spleen cells passively transferred into CSA-treated rats induced the disease in the recipients, whereas lymphoid cells from CSA-treated rats did not induce BD in infected cyclophosphamide-treated recipients. Antibodies were not involved in BD because rats treated with CSA revealed an inhibition of the synthesis of virus-specific antibodies for all regimens of treatment used (whether successful in preventing BD or not). After i.v. challenge of CSA-treated healthy rats with BDV, antiviral antibodies at low titers could be induced in some animals; however, no encephalitis or disease symptoms could be observed at any time after infection. The same was true for rats reinfected intracerebrally with BDV after discontinuation of CSA. These results support the hypothesis that unresponsiveness and even tolerance can be induced by CSA in the presence of the foreign Ag, demonstrating the beneficial effect of this immunosuppressive drug during a persistent viral infection.\r"

Elevated levels of anti-IgG antibodies were generally found in sera of rabbits immunized with protein SR, a B-related protein from Streptococcus mutans serogroup f, or recombinant protein SR (rSR). These anti-IgG antibodies could be involved in the previously mentioned heart cross-reactivities. Results from immunoblots and ELISA analyses demonstrate that these anti-IgG antibodies recognize common epitopes on SR, rSR, and human IgG2 and IgG4 probably located on the Fab region. Furthermore, control experiments with biotinylated human IgG show that the cross-reactions between IgG and SR were not mediated by an FcR mechanism. Direct competition between rSR and human IgG in binding to anti-IgG or anti-SR antibodies confirm that S. mutans SR protein possesses Ag mimicry with human IgG. Our studies provide some evidence that S. mutans SR protein and human IgG H chains share autoimmune epitopes which could play a role in the induction of anti-IgG antibodies and therefore could explain the enhancement of anti-IgG antibody levels observed in rabbits immunized with either S. mutans whole cells or purified B-related Ag.\r"

  ".W": "We have cloned the human perforin (P1) gene and sequenced 6.2-kb genomic DNA, containing 1.4-kb 5'-flanking region, the 5' untranslated region, the complete coding region and the beginning of the 3' untranslated region. The P1 gene including at least 95-bp 3' untranslated region is organized in only three exons: the first exon (97 bp) contains all but four nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region and was determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping. This exon is separated by 1.7 kb from the second exon containing the remaining (4 bp) 5' untranslated region, the leader peptide and the N-terminal region of P1 up to--but not including--the C9 homologous region. The third exon is separated by a 1.2-kb intron and contains the remainder of the molecule, including at least 90 bp of the 3' untranslated region. This simple gene organization differs from that of the more complicated C9 gene. Because of the unusual intron in the 5' untranslated sequence the transcription initiation (cap) site is located almost 1.8 kb upstream of the ATG start signal. The more immediate 5' flanking sequence contains a CCAAT and GC box but lacks other known promoter elements. Instead, we find three different sequence repeats. One of them, a hexanucleotide sequence with the consensus GCCCTG of unknown significance occurs 19 times within a stretch of 240 bp. Further upstream we localized sequences homologous to the following enhancer and promoter elements: c-fos proto-oncogene, IFN-gamma and phorbol ester response elements, five cAMP response elements, and three motifs corresponding to general inducer elements. In addition, a sequence conserved in the 5'-flanking region of several T cell genes was identified. The 5' flanking regions of P1. CCP1 (granzyme B) and CCP2 (granzyme C) (kindly provided by Dr. Bleackley) contain as only significant homology cAMP response elements. These findings are consistent with a tight control and regulation of P1, which appears to be distinct from that of granzymes.\r"

  ".W": "A profound thymic atrophy has been observed in mice bearing large adenocarcinomas of the mammary gland. Only 2 to 5% of thymocytes remained 4 wk after tumor implantation. Although there is a slight decrease in the overall percentages of Thy-1+ cells in tumor bearers, the majority of the remaining cells are of a Thy-1 low phenotype. There was a lower percentage of double positive (CD4+, CD8+) cells, an increase of CD4+ CD8- thymocytes, similar percentages of CD4- CD8+ cells and double negative (CD4- CD8-) thymocytes in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, an increased percentage of CD3 cells could be detected in these animals. These results indicate that proportionally less immature thymocytes are present in the atrophic thymuses of mammary tumor bearers. Enhanced levels of glucocorticoids are known to produce similar effects on the thymus. However, adrenalectomy of mice followed by tumor implantation did not result in reversal of the thymic atrophy. Furthermore, a study of serum corticosterone levels in tumor bearers indicated no significant changes during tumorigenesis. A study of several parameters of bone marrow (BM) populations indicate that there is an increase in cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage and a decrease in lymphocytes induced by tumor-derived granulocyte macrophage-CSF. An alteration of prothymocytes in the BM is not the main cause of the thymic atrophy because BM cells from normal and tumor-bearing mice reconstituted irradiated normal mice equally well. There was no preferential recruitment of double positive cells to the spleen as indicated by no significant differences in the levels of T cells of immature phenotype including the CD4+ CD8+ population in the spleens of tumor bearers. Because no major changes were observed in tumor bearers, either at their capacity to repopulate the thymus or at the patterns of subsequent redistribution of thymocytes, it was postulated that the thymic atrophy may be caused by a direct or indirect effect of the tumor or tumor-associated factor(s). Intrathymic injections of tumor cells into young normal recipient mice resulted in a significant reduction of the thymus weight and cellularity. These data suggest that mammary tumors can secrete factor(s) that are capable of severely impairing the normal development of cells of the T cell lineage.\r"

When a highly TNF-sensitive clone of WEHI-164 was grown in vivo in syngeneic mice it became resistant to rTNF such that a 4 to 5 log higher concentration of TNF was required to produce tumor lysis in vitro. When compared with an in vitro selected TNF-resistant variant, the in vivo selected line was significantly more tumorigenic. The resistant phenotype of both the in vivo and in vitro selected variants was stable in culture and both selected lines were also resistant to lysis by syngeneic spleen cells with natural cytotoxic activity. The parental clone and the two variants were equally sensitive to lysis by allo-CTL and expressed similar levels of MHC class I Ag. Resistance to TNF in the two variants was not a function of de novo production of TNF measured as supernatant TNF activity or TNF mRNA expression. These studies are the first to demonstrate that in vivo tumor growth results in resistance to TNF and therefore may have direct relevance to the efficacy of TNF in the treatment of human neoplasms.\r"

Experimental evidence, however, suggests that the fine immunoreactivity of the two antibodies is not identical, because MBr1 has a preferential reactivity with glycolipids and 2G-3 with glycoproteins. We suggest that a possible biologic explanation for our findings could reside in the nature of the immunogens used to raise the two mAb (glycolipid vs protein \"internal image\").\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease were treated with zinc acetate as their sole anticopper therapy. Treatment duration was 8 to 37 months. Three of the patients had symptoms; in eight who were presymptomatic, diagnosis was made because of affected siblings who had symptoms. All patients did well clinically. Copper absorption was suppressed, as reflected by blockade of absorption of orally administered copper 64. Values for 24-hour urine copper and nonceruloplasmin plasma copper (freely available copper) were reduced. Values for liver-derived serum enzymes were also generally reduced in patients who had pretreatment elevations. Percutaneous liver biopsies were done initially and repeated in seven of the patients after 12 to 35 months of zinc therapy. In five of these patients a second biopsy specimen showed higher levels of copper than the first. In three of these five a third biopsy 6 to 23 months after the second revealed liver copper values that either had returned to the baseline value or were lower. One patient's initial biopsy specimen showed active inflammation, which subsided with therapy. All of the biopsies revealed histologic scarring typical of cirrhosis, and this did not appear to change over the course of therapy. We conclude that hepatic copper may increase temporarily during early zinc therapy but that the accumulated copper is sequestered in a nontoxic form. On the basis of animal studies we postulate that this sequestered copper is primarily bound to the high levels of hepatic metallothionein induced by zinc. Zinc appears to be a reasonable option for the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease, particularly those with presymptomatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with Wilson's disease often have a further increase in hepatic copper when given zinc as an initial treatment, although there is no associated clinical deterioration. To better understand this situation an animal model was developed in which copper-loaded rats are treated with zinc administered subcutaneously. In the presence of equal amounts of copper loading in liver, control rats show hepatic damage but zinc-treated rats do not. Zinc-treated rats have much higher levels of hepatic metallothionein. Gel filtration studies reveal that much of the hepatic copper in zinc-treated rats is in this metallothionein fraction, whereas the copper in control animals is primarily associated with fractions of high or low molecular weight. Subcutaneous zinc therapy also induces intestinal, but not brain, metallothionein. We interpret these findings to indicate that zinc therapy protects against copper toxicity in liver by induction of hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters copper in a nontoxic form.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been proposed as an important mediator of the inflammatory response in acute lung injury. To better understand polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation during acute lung injury, we evaluated the effects of TNF on several in vitro PMN functions, including chemotaxis, chemiluminescence, and elastase activity. In the chemotaxis assay using a modified Boyden chamber, TNF alone or with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP, 10(-8) mol/L) did not alter PMN migration. TNF suspended with 1% zymosan-activated serum (ZAS) increased PMN migration at low concentrations and decreased migration at high concentrations (control 99 +/- 4.8 microns, n = 9; TNF 0.1 ng/ml 135 +/- 9.4 microns, n = 5, p less than 0.01; TNF 1000 ng/ml 62 +/- 7.5 microns, n = 5, p less than 0.01). In the chemiluminescence assay, TNF (1000 ng/ml) induced a 3-fold increase in the PMN chemiluminescent response. However, TNF incubated with PMN did not cause an increase in supernatant elastase activity. These data reveal TNF induced the production of PMN reactive oxygen species as evidenced by an increased chemiluminescent response. Whereas TNF increased chemotaxis at low concentrations in the presence of 1% ZAS, high concentrations of TNF similar to levels detected in septic shock caused a decrease in chemotaxis that might contribute to retaining PMN in sites of inflammation. It is thus suggested that TNF may contribute to inflammation by stimulating the production of PMN-reactive oxygen species and modulating-PMN chemotaxis.\r"

  ".W": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous compounds produced by phagocytes with important roles in both host defense and pulmonary inflammation. Enhanced ROS metabolism by alveolar macrophages (AM) has been previously demonstrated in various interstitial lung diseases including sarcoidosis. We studied 17 healthy, nonsmoking volunteers and 10 patients with sarcoidosis by bronchoalveolar lavage, and separated AM on discontinuous Percoll gradients to determine patterns of airspace cell recovery and the corresponding ROS metabolism of density-defined AM subpopulations. AM subpopulations were largely purified from contaminating granulocytes, thereby allowing more accurate estimation of ROS metabolism by AM. In bronchoalveolar lavage material from sarcoidosis patients, increased recovery of cells of high (1.075 gm/ml) density was found, which contrasted with the pattern seen in the volunteers in whom cells of lowest density (1.045 gm/ml) predominated. In addition, dense cells from sarcoidosis patients exhibited enhanced stimulated ROS metabolism compared with cells of similar density obtained from the volunteers or with sarcoid cells of lower density. At least three mechanisms may contribute to increased lung oxidative burden in sarcoidosis. The combination of increased bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts, increased cell recovery at high density, and increased cell function produced substantial increases in the total oxidative burden imposed on the lungs of sarcoidosis patients by airspace cells. We conclude that AM metabolism of ROS is dependent on the density and, by implication, the maturity of the cells and that regulation of AM ROS metabolism differs markedly between sarcoidosis patients and healthy volunteers.\r"

ECs exposed for 2 hours or longer to 0.10 to 10 micrograms/ml lipopolysaccharide demonstrated significant increases in the levels of M0 adherence compared to control cells. By contrast, lipopolysaccharide added directly to adherence assays or preincubated with M0 did not increase M0 adherence to ECs. The effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) were similar to the effects of lipopolysaccharide in that they acted solely on ECs to enhance M0 adherence and accelerated the rate of EC adherence to M0. Lipopolysaccharide did not increase EC adherence of M0 by causing damage or extracellular release of soluble mediators. The increase in M0-EC adherence by the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP) was quite different from that by lipopolysaccharide and IL-1. FMLP rapidly induced M0 to become more adherent to ECs and plastic surfaces but was unable to act on ECs and enhance M0 binding. Thus M0-EC interactions are enhanced by the direct effects of FMLP on M0, whereas the actions of lipopolysaccharide and IL-1 are entirely focused on ECs and can be distinguished by differing characteristics and cellular targets.\r"

Micropuncture studies have shown IL-1 inhibition of sodium reabsorption by the rat papillary collecting duct (PCD), a nephron segment capable of abundant PGE2 synthesis. The current study examined the effect of IL-1 on PGE2 synthesis by cultured PCD cells and the mechanism by which such regulation occurs. IL-1 markedly increased PCD cell PGE2 synthesis within 15 minutes of exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Preincubation with saturating concentrations of arachidonic acid abolished IL-1 stimulation of PGE2 synthesis. PCD cells labeled with tritiated arachidonic acid released significantly more arachidonic acid within 5 minutes of exposure to IL-1 as compared to control cells. These data demonstrate that IL-1 directly stimulates PGE2 synthesis by PCD cells and that this effect occurs by enhancement of arachidonic acid release.\r"

  ".U": "90079275\r", 
  ".W": "Amiloride combined with subinhibitory concentrations of tobramycin is synergistic against Pseudomonas cepacia in vitro. It is known that amiloride blocks transmembrane sodium (Na+) flux in eukaryotic cells, but the mechanism of action in bacteria is unknown. Amiloride-mediated Na+ gradient changes might affect transcellular tobramycin transport, resulting in synergy between these two drugs. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the effect of extracellular [Na+] on amiloride-tobramycin synergy with a reference strain of P. cepacia. Control growth in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) alone, MHB supplemented with 200 mmol/L NaCl, and MHB dialyzed against a Na+-free solution was determined by absorbance at 650 nm over 3 hours. Inhibition in the presence of amiloride, tobramycin, or a combination was expressed as percentage of control growth. Growth in the presence of tobramycin alone was significantly higher in MHB + NaCl than in MHB or dialyzed MHB (81% +/- 5%; vs 57% +/- 5%; 35% +/- 4%; mean +/- SEM, respectively, p = 0.003). Growth in the presence of amiloride alone was not significantly different in the three media (84% +/- 4%; 80% +/- 3%; 80% +/- 1%; respectively, p = 0.746). Percent control growth was significantly lower when the two drugs were combined, but results were not statistically different among the three media (3.5% +/- 3%; 0.2% +/- 0.8%; 4% +/- 1%; respectively, p = 0.604). We conclude that growth inhibition of P. cepacia in the presence of tobramycin is antagonized by increasing extracellular [Na+]. This antagonistic effect of [Na+] is reversed by amiloride. Changes in [Na+] do not appear to directly affect amiloride-tobramycin synergy in P. cepacia.\r"

A chart review was undertaken to document the prevalence of asymptomatic HBV infection in a high-risk, predominantly minority, indigent, and immigrant family practice clinic population and to evaluate the frequency of accepted known risk factors for those subjects with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening tests. Records for 464 pregnant women entering the prenatal program between January 1, 1983, and April 30, 1987, were reviewed. Twenty-three (5.3%) were found positive for the HBsAG, all were asymptomatic. Results of a logistic regression on multiple risk factors for HBV infection revealed that ethnicity was the sole predictor of a positive HBsAg screening test, with 13% of the Asian patients and 1% of the Latino subjects positive for HBsAg. Other historical factors such as previous sexually transmitted disease and past history of transfusion were not predictive. These results reaffirm that a screening program for asymptomatic HBV infection in selected prenatal populations can identify a significant number of infants at risk for risk for perinatal infection.\r"

A questionnaire was mailed to a cross-sectional, random national sample of 301 family physicians who are members of the American Academy of Family Physicians and who completed a residency between 1981 and 1986. There was a 66% response rate to three mailings, with 197 questionnaires analyzed. Sixty-two percent of the physicians reported they were making house calls. The majority (53%) made less than one house call per month. Fewer than 15% made house calls on a weekly basis. There was a downward trend by residency year in the percentage of physicians making house calls when comparing graduates from 1981 to 1986. House calls do not appear to be a significant part of the practice of young family physicians.\r"

Some would have the specialty leave the academic arena and pursue a biopsychosocial mode of practice in the community. Others would have family medicine aggressively pursue academic research, apparently by abandoning the biopsychosocial approach to medical care. Chemistry as an academic discipline and as applied in community practice has solved many of the problems facing family medicine today. This paper suggests that one may learn much from chemistry. Four basic principles of applied science are presented from the point of view of a chemist: (1) science has an important but strictly limited contribution to make to medical practice; the humanistic goals of family medicine are philosophical decisions, and science is used to attain these goals; (2) observations are the basic reality of science; theory, to be useful, must explain and predict observations; (3) there is a basic unity in science; and (4) there is no hierarchy in scientific understanding. A model based on these four principles is presented that defines family medicine as the central, coordinating discipline in modern academic and community medical practice.\r"

From the initial group, 19 remained stable in their choice of family medicine, and 24 switched to another specialty. Medical school folders and telephone interviews were used as data sources. The characteristics of stable family physicians and those who became specialists were identified, and the predictive power of these criteria was tested with 30 graduates selected at random. Based only on their entrance records, 25 of the 30 graduates were correctly identified as future family physicians or specialists. The use of these criteria in the admission process is discussed in terms of increasing the number of students who will become stable family physicians.\r"

The comparison measures were indices of cognition derived from COGLAB, a multiparadigmatic cognitive test battery. COGLAB includes measures of preattentional, attentional, conceptual, and psychomotor performance. As expected, the patients were deficient on all but one of the measures. The nonschizotypic elevation group was not different from the normal control group. Schizotypal subjects were found to have deficits in three areas of information processing: preattentional processing, response biasing, and concept attainment and manipulation. However, their performance was just as good as and less variable than that of normal subjects on psychomotor and attentional tasks. The results do not support the hypothesis that schizotypy is characterized by pervasive cognitive deficits which are simply less severe than those of other psychiatric groups. Rather, there are discrete deficits in specific areas and possibly compensatory abnormalities associated with primary deficits. The results are further discussed with regard to the hypothesis that schizotypy shares a common neurophysiological and/or developmental substrate with more severe psychiatric disorders.\r"

(J Nerv Ment Dis 176:364-367; 368-371, 1988) disagreed concerning the need for further studies investigating the presence of thought disorder and associative cognitive dysfunction in relatives of schizophrenics. Saccuzzo et al. were concerned at the variations in the results of previous studies. Methodological issues relevant to such variation are discussed. It is pointed out that the study (McConaghy J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 22:243-246, 1959) initiating psychometric investigation of cognitive processes of relatives of schizophrenics was based on the belief that what was familially transmitted was not thought disorder, but a nonpathological looseness of associations, shown also by a percentage of normal subjects. This looseness was later termed allusive thinking. It was considered that allusive thinking acted as an inherited predisposition to schizophrenia. It required the addition of impairment of abstract thinking to constitute the characteristic thought disorder originally described by Bleuler. To account for the significant degree of thought disorder found in 6% to 12% of normal subjects, some researchers now accept that thought disorder exists in normal subjects on a continuum with schizophrenic thought disorder. It is suggested that replication of a later study demonstrating familial transmission of allusive thinking in university students and their parents could aid in clarifying the significance of the findings of increased incidence of looseness of associations in the families of schizophrenics.\r"

Parts of the Weschler Memory Test and a shortened version of the Stroop Test were administered to test the hypotheses that the attentional deficit could be explained by problems of memory or cognitive fatigue. All patients showed deficits on all of the Stroop scales, but closer analysis of the results permitted discrimination of schizophrenic from nonschizophrenic patients. Schizophrenic patients showed as much difficulty as nonschizophrenic subjects on a limited-duration selective-attention task, but deteriorated significantly more when selective attention had to be maintained. The results could not be attributed to memory problems in the schizophrenic group. The results support the existence of two separable selective attention deficits in schizophrenic patients: a difficulty in selectively attending to the salient aspect of a complex stimulus, a difficulty shared with nonschizophrenic subjects, and a difficulty in maintaining selective attention over time that seems to be more marked in schizophrenic subjects.\r"

Sixty eight patients with Parkinson's disease and 28 age and education matched normal controls were evaluated using neuropsychological procedures that included assessment of language, memory, cognition, visuospatial skills and mood. Twenty three patients (34%) were found to have developed significant impairment in at least three of the five areas, thus meeting criteria for a dementia syndrome. Eleven patients (16%) had no intellectual impairment and thirty four patients (50%) had a mild to moderate intellectual disturbance. Patients with (n = 10) and without dementia (n = 20), matched for severity of Parkinson's disease, and normal controls (n = 10) matched for age with the two patients groups, were evaluated by MRI. MRI scans were analysed for evidence of generalised cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlargement, visualisation of the substantia nigra and severity of focal brain lesions. Results indicated that the presence of dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease was not associated with any specific pattern of MRI abnormalities.\r"

This paper reports experimental investigations designed to test the hypothesis that the locus of the impairment is the visuospatial subsystem of working memory. Subjects were a group of sixteen patients with Parkinson's disease of mild to moderate severity and a matched control group. They performed complex visuospatial and verbal memory tasks. The Parkinsonian group were significantly slower than the control group when performing the visuospatial task. They were not significantly slower and made no more errors than the control group on the verbal task. The findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the visuospatial subsystem of working memory is impaired in Parkinson's disease. It is demonstrated that the impairment is not the result of a reduction in the capacity of this subsystem but is due to difficulty in utilising information stored in the subsystem to perform complex visuospatial tasks.\r"

The behavioural alterations resemble those of Denny-Brown and Chambers' monkey with bilateral ablation of the parietal lobe which were characterised by strong withdrawal or refusal to be touched on the limbs and head. In both humans and animals, touch on the limbs or head elicited exaggerated withdrawal movements and refusal to be touched on the lips and tongue resulted in difficulty in feeding. These behavioural alterations can be interpreted as loss of exploratory activities towards extrapersonal space, or more positively, as rejection of contact with the environment. This rejection behaviour in which tactile, visual, and/or gustatory exploration tendencies are altered, is a counterpart of human frontal lobe syndrome and human Kluver-Bucy syndrome.\r"

This procedure allowed measurement of grip in a large proportion of patients, and strength correlated highly with performance on the other tests.

Resistance to ischaemic conduction failure (RICF), a characteristic electrophysiological feature of diabetic neuropathy, was assessed by measuring the decline in median nerve action potential amplitude at minute intervals for up to 20 minutes while the arm was rendered ischaemic. Initial nerve conduction velocity and action potential amplitude was similar in all three groups. Following the onset of ischaemia the time to a 50% reduction in action potential amplitude was prolonged in both diabetic subjects and hypoxaemic subjects compared with controls. After 20 minutes of ischaemia no control subject had persisting nerve function, while function remained in 5 (80%) of hypoxaemic subjects and 10 (83%) of diabetic subjects. The time to a 50% reduction in action potential amplitude during ischaemia correlated with the blood oxygen saturation among the hypoxic subjects and haemoglobin Alc among diabetic subjects. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxia has a role in the pathogenesis of resistance to ischaemic conduction failure in diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "90079751\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous paper, we determined that treatment of lymphocytes with nonviable preparations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) results in an impairment of the phosphatidylinositol/protein kinase C pathway, most likely due to an inhibition of the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, mediated by phospholipase C. Here we show that one consequence of these changes is a reduced phosphorylation of nuclear matrix-associated DNA topoisomerase II, resulting in an inhibition of the activity of this enzyme. Antibodies to the viral proteins suppressed the inhibitory effects caused by the HIV-1 preparation. Furthermore, the phytohemagglutinin A-caused augmentation of nuclear matrix-associated DNA polymerase alpha and beta activities was found to be abolished by coincubation with the HIV preparation or with the HIV-1 gp120. The phytohemagglutinin A-enhanced matrix association and processivity of DNA polymerase alpha was determined to be reduced if the lymphocytes were in contact with HIV-1 preparation. These results suggest that the reduced proliferative response of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin A in the presence of disrupted HIV-1 preparation is due to inhibition of at least two, perhaps separate, pathways, one involving protein kinase C resulting in a reduced phosphorylation of DNA topoisomerase II and the other changing the state of matrix association of DNA polymerase alpha and beta.\r"

The first, an enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), used an anti-AZT monoclonal antibody (MAb) and subsequent alkaline phosphatase second antibody system for the detection method. The second, a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), used a polyclonal anti-AZT antibody followed by a europium-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) as the fluorescent probe. The ELISA had a detection range from 125 to 4,000 nM and a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of about 500 nM. Development of the TR-FIA was based on a very sensitive detection system of metal chelate chemistry and time-resolved fluorometry. The standard curve in the TR-FIA was from 5 to 4,000 nM with an IC50 of 200 nM. Intra- and interassay precision of the ELISA was good, with coefficients of variation from 3.9 to 7.3% and 3 to 17%, respectively, while the same values for the TR-FIA were 6.2 to 10.9% and 5.4 to 19.9%, respectively. The results obtained from each method were compared individually with those of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). There was good agreement among the results obtained by each method. These two methods enable laboratories not licensed for radioisotopes to analyze potentially infectious samples without aerosol-forming centrifugation.\r"

The treatments included 0.5 and 5 mg oral tablets, a 0.5 mg oral solution, and a 0.5 mg intravenous infusion. Blood samples were collected for 4 to 6 h after each dose. Plasma concentrations of ddC were determined by a specific gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) assay. A combination of the low dose and the assay sensitivity of 2 ng/ml limited data treatment and comparison. Mean Cmax of 8.5, 7.6, and 79.0 ng/ml occurred at mean tmax of 1.1, 1.3, and 0.9 h for the 0.5 mg oral solution, the 0.5 mg tablet, and the 5 mg tablet, respectively. A mean clearance of 5.57 ml/min/kg and volume of distribution of 0.64 L/kg were determined from the 0.5 mg intravenous infusion. Half-life values ranged between 0.95 and 2.0 h and appeared to be independent of the dose and route of administration. The bioavailability values calculated for the oral tablets were variable, ranging from 54 to 127%. Single doses of ddC were well tolerated in this population. The results of this pilot study indicate that ddC is rapidly and extensively absorbed when administered as an oral tablet or solution to fasting AIDS or ARC patients. It is also rapidly eliminated with a half-life of 1-2 h. There are no apparent differences in the absorption or elimination of ddC between 0.5 and 5 mg oral doses.\r"

Levels of four salivary antimicrobial proteins (lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory IgA, and histatins) were determined, as well as total fluid output of the major salivary glands. Concentrations of all four salivary antimicrobial proteins were found to be increased in the stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva of all HIV-1-positive patients as well as the subset of unmediated HIV-1-positive patients. Those patients with evidence of oral candidiasis had the highest concentrations of lysozyme and histatins, potent antifungal proteins, in their saliva. Although the etiology of these protein increases is still unknown, these results further document salivary changes following HIV-1 infection.\r"

The method estimates the distribution of reporting delays from a cross-classification of incident cases according to date of diagnosis vs. length of reporting delay. Using the delay distribution, the number of cases reported to have occurred within each period of calendar time is inflated to reflect the actual number of cases diagnosed but not yet reported. The method assumes that the delay distribution is independent of the calendar period of diagnosis, but can readily be modified to account for early departures from the current pattern. The method is illustrated using surveillance data from the northeastern United States.\r"

Nonparametric models of HIV infectivity are constructed as alternatives for comparison to the simple models. The results suggest that while HIV infectivity can be modeled as a Bernoulli process with a constant infection probability per partner, the Bernoulli model may not be appropriate at the level of sexual contacts. Probabilistic arguments consistent with these findings are proposed and discussed.\r"

Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex. We suggest that education to promote the need for awareness of one's own and one's partner's HIV status should be stressed.\r"

Of these 176 women, 134 women were HIV-1 antibody tested and 1 was found to be seropositive; she denied all other AIDS-associated risk behavior and her husband was seronegative. The results of this investigation provide additional evidence that HIV-1 transmission can occur through artificial insemination with semen from an infected donor although the risk of HIV-1 transmission appears to be lower than that reported by other investigators. It is clear that HIV-1 screening of all potential semen donors should be routine practice whenever artificial insemination is performed.\r"

The proportion meeting only new criteria was 28% overall, with a range of 0 to 82% in different states and territories. This proportion was 26% in the last quarter of 1987 and increased to 31% in the last quarter of 1988. It was higher in heterosexual intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) (43%) and lower in homosexual male non-IVDAs (21%) than in other groups. The new criteria, but not earlier (pre-1985) criteria, generally require a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; however, use of HIV testing varies among states, as demonstrated by differences in the percentage of pre-1985-criteria cases with a reported HIV test (39 to greater than 95%). The revision has changed the distribution of characteristics of cases (e.g., heterosexual IVDAs composed 18% of cases meeting old criteria, 35% of cases meeting only new criteria, and 23% of all cases). Interpretation of trends in both the number and characteristics of cases should take into account the variable impact of the revision on reporting.\r"

In the 150 households of male index cases, 92 (61.3%) of their spouses were infected, compared with 57 (73.1%) of the spouses of the 78 female index cases. The more advanced the clinical stage of illness in the index cases, the greater the probability of HIV infection in the spouse (RR = 4.44), and the more likely the spouse was symptomatic. Four of the 11 spouses who seroconverted to HIV had also had sexual intercourse at a time when their HIV-infected partner had genital ulcers (RR = 7.45). Of 144 children under 5 years of age, 36 (25.0%) were infected, all had infected mothers and were the last to be borne in all but one household. Three of 120 children 5 to 10 years of age were also infected, presumably through perinatal transmission. Forty-six of 52 discordantly infected couples followed for 1 year continued to have unprotected vaginal intercourse, and 11 (21.2%) of these seroconverted to HIV. There were no HIV infections that could be attributed to transmission by other means than heterosexual intercourse between spouses or by perinatal infection in children borne of infected mothers. The study suggests that there is an increasing risk of HIV heterosexual transmission as infection progresses in the infected partner, and that more effective counseling is needed to prevent it.\r"

The male to female ratio of cases was 1.5:1 and women were younger (mean age of 26.2 years) than were men (mean age of 31.2 years). HIV-infected persons had significantly more lifetime sex partners than uninfected persons; other risk factors were a prior history of venereal disease, blood transfusion, travel abroad, and a positive syphilis serology. Clinical features in decreasing order of frequency were weight loss, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, chronic cough, multidermatomal herpes zoster, diarrhea, recurrent fevers, tuberculosis, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. The WHO clinical case definition for the diagnosis of AIDS had a low positive predictive value for the 125 Zambians with AIDS, but among all those infected with HIV, the positive predictive value was 76.4%. Thirty (35.3%) of 85 patients who were HIV seronegative when first examined acquired HIV infections during a 12- to 39-month (means = 21.8 months) period of observation. Heterosexual intercourse unrelated to prostitution appears to be the major mode of HIV transmission in Lusaka.\r"

The i(12p) was found in tumors from all primary sites and in all histologies, including a choriocarcinoma. The presence of three or more additional copies of 12p was associated with a statistically significant greater likelihood of treatment failure. With diagnostic and possibly prognostic importance in germ cell tumors in males, the high frequency of i(12p) in our series of studies and in those of others indicates that it probably occurs as a very early defect in the development of these tumors. Further studies of chromosome 12 in males with these tumors are warranted.\r"

The risk factors used were age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of previous biopsies, and number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer. A model of relative risks for various combinations of these factors was developed from case-control data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP). The model allowed for the fact that relative risks associated with previous breast biopsies were smaller for women aged 50 or more than for younger women. Thus, the proportional hazards models for those under age 50 and for those of age 50 or more. The baseline age-specific hazard rate, which is the rate for a patient without identified risk factors, is computed as the product of the observed age-specific composite hazard rate times the quantity 1 minus the attributable risk. We calculated individualized breast cancer probabilities from information on relative risks and the baseline hazard rate. These calculations take competing risks and the interval of risk into account. Our data were derived from women who participated in the BCDDP and who tended to return for periodic examinations. For this reason, the risk projections given are probably most reliable for counseling women who plan to be examined about once a year.\r"

In our study, a quantitative relationship has been established between reversal of multidrug resistance by resistance modifiers and a concomitant decrease in intracellular levels of doxorubicin measured at equitoxic concentrations (IC50) in CHRC5 and 2780AD multidrug-resistant cells. (IC50 = concentration required for 50% growth inhibition.) We have demonstrated that resistance modifiers like verapamil and Ro 11-2933/001 act by increasing the effectiveness of intracellular doxorubicin, apparently by inducing redistribution of the drug from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of a multidrug-resistant cell, as shown by quantitative fluorescence microscopy. At complete reversal of resistance, as measured directly or inferred by extrapolation, the amount of intracellular doxorubicin at the IC50 as well as the ratio of nuclear doxorubicin to cytoplasmic doxorubicin were the same as those in sensitive cells. These results offer an explanation for the frequently observed discrepancies between drug accumulation and cytotoxicity and also show quantitatively that a decrease in drug accumulation and a change in intracellular drug distribution together are the only determinants of doxorubicin resistance in the multidrug-resistant cells studied.\r"

This model is 89% accurate in predicting survival. Using histologic criteria, we assigned melanomas to tumor progression steps by ascertaining their particular growth phase. These phases were the in situ and invasive radial growth phase and the vertical growth phase (the focal formation of a dermal tumor nodule or dermal tumor plaque within the radial growth phase or such dermal growth without an evident radial growth phase). After a minimum follow-up of 100.6 months and a median follow-up of 150.2 months, 122 invasive radial-growth-phase tumors were found to be without metastases. Eight-year survival among the 264 patients whose tumors had entered the vertical growth phase was 71.2%. Survival prediction in these patients was enhanced by the use of a multivariable logistic regression model. Twenty-three attributes were tested for entry into this model. Six had independently predictive prognostic information: (a) mitotic rate per square millimeter, (b) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, (c) tumor thickness, (d) anatomic site of primary melanoma, (e) sex of the patient, and (f) histologic regression. When mitotic rate per square millimeter, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, primary site, sex, and histologic regression are added to a logistic regression model containing tumor thickness alone, they are independent predictors of 8-year survival (P less than .0005).\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the possibility of increased activity of cytotoxic anticancer drugs combined with cytokines, we treated human melanoma cells with combinations of etoposide (VP-16) and human recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha). We evaluated the combined cytotoxic effects of VP-16 and rIL-1 alpha using A375-C6 cells, which are sensitive to rIL-1 alpha, and A375-C5 cells, a clonal variant line resistant to rIL-1 alpha. We used the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromid e) assay and the inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. We analyzed data using the median effects principle of Chou and Talalay (Chou's analysis). The calculated combination index values, at a dose ratio of VP-16 to rIL-1 alpha of 12:1 in simultaneous exposure, indicated synergistic cytotoxicity toward both A375-C6 cells and A375-C5 cells. We observed more pronounced synergism with VP-16 and rIL-1 alpha toward the A375-C5 IL-1 alpha-resistant melanoma cells. These results suggest that rIL-1 alpha combined with cytotoxic antitumor drugs may provide increased benefit in the treatment of malignant melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in humans and occurs primarily on sun-exposed areas of the body. In a study of 808 Caucasian Maryland watermen, we examined the prevalence of nonmelanoma skin cancer in relation to age and exposure to solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. For each study subject, the exposure to solar UVB radiation for each year of life after the age of 16 years was calculated. We obtained the data for this analysis by combining a detailed occupational history with laboratory and field measurements. Prevalence of the three major types of nonmelanoma skin neoplasms was analyzed: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and actinic keratosis (AK). Average annual exposure to UVB radiation was strongly correlated with the prevalence of SCC, but not with the prevalence of BCC or AK. This finding is consistent with dose saturation (plateau in dose-response relationship) for the induction of BCC and AK in humans with high annual exposure to UVB radiation. In addition, two small groups of apparently hypersusceptible individuals were present in the population. One group had SCC despite low annual exposure to UVB radiation, and the other group had multiple skin cancers despite average exposure to UVB radiation.\r"

This antigen, which is rarely detectable in the normal colonic epithelium, was expressed in 13 of 19 adenomas with moderate to severe dysplasia and nine of nine cases of inflammatory bowel disease. The antibody reacted with the normal-appearing mucosa adjacent to a carcinoma in 10 of 12 cases, although only eight of the tumors expressed the antigen. The expression of the TAG-72 antigen in the colonic epithelium may be an early marker of malignant transformation.\r"

  ".W": "We studied cancer incidence and mortality from cancer and coronary heart disease in relation to serum cholesterol levels in 92,710 individuals followed-up in the nationwide Swedish Cancer Register and the Swedish Cause of Death Register for 18-20 years. According to Cox's proportional hazard model, total cancer incidence and total cancer mortality were negatively correlated to serum cholesterol level (P less than .001). The negative correlations were most pronounced during the first years of follow-up. Cancer mortality data showed a stronger negative association to cholesterol than did incidence data during the first 10 years of follow-up (P less than .05). Mortality from coronary heart disease was positively correlated to serum cholesterol (P less than .001) during the entire follow-up. In contrast to most studies that were based on mortality data, our results of the comparison of incidence and mortality data of the same cohort are in agreement with those of a cholesterol-lowering effect of a preclinical cancer. Efforts by investigators and clinicians to lower serum cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular disease are, according to the present findings, not likely to increase cancer mortality risks but would extend life, irrespective of cause of death.\r"
