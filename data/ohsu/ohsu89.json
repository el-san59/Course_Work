  ".W": "Morphine, the active metabolite of heroin, is rapidly inactivated by glucuronidation at the 3 carbon. Unconjugated (pharmacologically active) morphine was measured in postmortem blood by radioimmunoassay using an antibody-coated tube kit. The kit shows less than 0.2% cross-reactivity with codeine and morphine-glucuronide. Unconjugated morphine concentrations were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using deuterated morphine as the internal standard. The blood was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), centrifuged, and decanted. The supernatant was then either diluted (unhydrolyzed) or heated to 100 degrees C, 30 min (hydrolyzed), followed by a wash with 4:1 chloroform:isopropranol. The upper aqueous layer was then saturated with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and extracted with 4:1 chloroform:isopropranol. The organic layer was evaporated, derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFA), and analyzed by selected ion monitoring (SIM) GC/MS. Comparison of the results for unconjugated morphine by radioimmunoassay and unhydrolyzed morphine by GC/MS gave a correlation coefficient of r = 0.98, n = 100. Unconjugated morphine ranged from 0 to 100% of total morphine with a mean of 42%, n = 200, for heroin or morphine involved deaths. Review of 56 putative rapid deaths gave a mean of 68% unconjugated morphine with a range of 26 to 100%. The ratio of unconjugated to total morphine was found to be stable in postmortem blood after more than a year of storage at room temperature, within the precision of the method.\r"

The ages of the subjects varied from 14 to 87 years. Statistical comparison of the maxillary arch width, mandibular arch width, and the mean difference between maxillary and mandibular arch width were performed. Significant differences between the arch width measurements were found to exist between several classes of subjects based on race and sex.\r"

The mean age of the 69 car driver victims was 59 years, considerably higher than that of traumatic car deaths, and all but 2 were males. The mean age of 57 operators of other vehicles was 66 years, and of these, 6 were women. Seven car drivers were stricken during commercial employment. Most accidents occurred during daytime and the distribution of the weekdays was fairly even. Ischemic heart disease accounted for 112 deaths, and other cardiovascular diseases for an additional 9 deaths. Only 1/5 of the victims experienced previous symptoms of disease. Out of at least 31 other persons at risk in the car deaths, only 2 passengers suffered minor injuries. The trauma in the deceased was in most cases minor in both car and other vehicle deaths. Property damage was also minimal. At least 1/3 of the drivers were able to stop the car before becoming unconscious. In none of the car cases was alcohol detected in the blood, while alcohol was identified in at least 2 of the other vehicle victims. The findings here agree with previous studies that natural deaths at the wheel are fairly uncommon, and that the risk for other persons is not significant. The value of adequate postmortem examinations of drivers dying in traffic is stressed--natural deaths can otherwise be overlooked.\r"

The committee carefully evaluates all identified high-risk patients according to specific criteria before such patients are discharged. Two case studies illustrate this process of evaluation.\r"

In contrast, memory functions were most often to be found only in the unaffected hemisphere, also regardless of handedness or side of lesion. A lesion of either hemisphere appeared capable of interfering with language and verbal memory functions in an unexpectedly high proportion of patients.\r"

Exclusively \"intellectual\" auras were confined to a group of high IQ males. The number of aura experiences described per person correlated with Verbal IQ for males but not females, but also varied with side, sex, and nature of lesion. The results are discussed in terms of the necessary conditions for aura and their relevance and in relationship to the results of brain stimulation studies by Penfield and others.\r"

These two oscillations were separated by applying inertial and spring loads to the wrist. There was no evidence of increased or unstable stretch-reflex activity in the essential tremor patients, and stretch-reflex latencies did not correlate with the frequency of essential tremor. Essential tremor and mechanically-induced stretch-reflex oscillations are separate phenomena capable of complex interaction.\r"

A wide range of within-patient variability was found, with some patients showing little and others showing considerable fluctuations in amplitude over the series of recordings. There was no simple relationship between variability and mean amplitude, frequency, age, duration of tremor or response to a single oral dose of propranolol. Variability did not differ between males and females or between patients with and without a family history of tremor. Diurnal fluctuations showed no consistent pattern. Long-term assessment revealed a significant trend towards lower amplitudes on successive occasions. To overcome systematic bias in data collection, clinical trials in essential tremor should employ large numbers of patients and rigorous randomisation of treatments in cross-over designs.\r"

Good interobserver and test-retest reliability was demonstrated for all tests, and the Frenchay Arm Test was shown to be valid. Normal values for all tests were established on 63 controls. It was found that the limited sensitivity of the Frenchay Arm Test could be improved using the Nine Hole Peg Test and grip strength. Recovery of arm function has been studied in a sample of 56 patients seen regularly over the first 3 months after their stroke, using these standard measures. The results demonstrated a wide variation in recovery curves between patients. The use of the Nine Hole Peg Test enabled further recovery to be detected after patients achieved a top score on the Frenchay Arm Test. Failure to recover measureable grip strength before 24 days was associated with absence of useful arm function at three months. Measurement of finger tapping rate was not useful.\r"

Lacunes were found in patients in the first three groups. However, 80% of those who had hemiparesis and incomplete sensory loss were found to have a lacune or normal CT scan whilst only 33% of those with complete motor or sensory impairment had lacunes. It is proposed that sensorimotor stroke as a lacunar syndrome be best restricted to those with only mild to moderate hemiparesis and sensory impairment in both upper and lower limbs. The degree and extent of sensory and motor involvement may vary, however, possibly dependent on whether the thalamo-geniculate, anterior choroidal or lateral lenticulostriate artery is affected.\r"

In two patients the condition appeared to be static and, according to the patients' accounts was life long. In the third the sweating loss was present for three years prior to pain loss becoming evident from C2/3 to T1 on the same side as the sweating loss. These patients, together with two recent case reports, indicate that isolated local autonomic failure, probably from a discrete cord lesion, can be a cause of presenting symptoms related to sweating loss or to change in temperature in a limb.\r"

These observations may reflect a greater susceptibility of oligodendrocytes to anoxia compared with astrocytes and fibroblasts.\r"

Whilst muscarinic receptor binding is generally reported to be normal or near normal, findings are reported which indicate substantial reductions of hippocampal nicotinic (high affinity nicotine) binding (occurring in conjunction with decreased choline acetyltransferase) in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's but not Huntington's disease. A further indication that nicotinic receptor function may be abnormal in Alzheimer's disease is the extensive loss of an endogenous compound, detected for the first time in human brain, which inhibits normal nicotinic binding. Both receptor binding and the inhibitor are also substantially decreased with increasing age in the normal hippocampus.\r"

It became evident that higher prevalences existed in some places in Southern Europe previously thought to be regions of very low frequency. Limitations in the evaluation and comparison of data presented were obvious in view of differences in concepts, techniques and the intensity of surveys carried out. There was general agreement that this first collaborative attempt to map the frequency of multiple sclerosis in Europe should be followed up by standardized procedures and more cooperation in epidemiological surveys.\r"

Of the patients, 55% revealed an additional loss of N 13a, recorded at the level of the C7 spinous process; in 15% all cortical and spinal evoked potentials were missing, but Erb's point waves were still normal. These results suggest two different origins of the main negative waves (N 13a and N 13b), recorded above the upper and lower cervical spinal cord.

After 3 weeks his condition deteriorated with increase of the fluid collection shown by CT. Partial drainage of the haematoma by subdural puncture with a 22-gauge spinal needle resulted in complete recovery from the neurological deficit and complete resorption of the effusion.

Thirty healthy subjects were then investigated by presenting single and paired stimuli with a PCI of 4, 3.1, 2.3 and 1.5 ms at a repetition rate of 10/s to each subject. With diminishing PCIs, identification and latency measurement of waves IV and V became increasingly difficult because of marked amplitude reduction.

Component I did not show a consistent latency change with any PCI but its amplitude was significantly reduced with 4 ms PCI. These findings differ from those reported when using PCIs of 5 ms or more and when using single stimuli at a high repetition rate, where component V was the most stable. The alterations of evoked potentials found only with a PCI of 1.5 ms are probably of central origin.\r"

Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including the measurement of immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M, indicate that pleocytosis and/or disturbance of the blood-CSF barrier (BCB) and/or local immunoglobulin synthesis within the central nervous system (CNS) do occur in about 25% of patients with AIPFP. The commonest finding is a slight to moderate breakdown of BCB function without evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. In only about 10% of patients, further support for an inflammatory process within the CNS is found by intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG and/or localized synthesis of IgG and/or IgA. The majority of cases (75%) do not show any signs of an inflammatory process within the CNS. In contrast, lymphocytic meningopolyradiculitis (LMR) has a characteristic CSF profile with early impairment of BCB permeability as well as with rapid and predominant intrathecal IgM synthesis, which helps to distinguish monosymptomatic LMR from AIPFP. By applying a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identical concentrations of IgG in serum and CSF, evidence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies was found only in 2 of 13 patients with AIPFP. In contrast, all 4 patients with herpes zoster oticus and peripheral facial palsy (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) showed an intrathecal IgG synthesis to varicella zoster virus lasting for up to 4 months after onset of disease.\r"

In the literature deflexion in the horizontal plane is most frequently considered, but analysis of the data shows that deflexion in the coronal and sagittal planes is also important. Furthermore, it is found that especially the deflexions in the coronal and sagittal plane covariate with the patients' complaints, but not with horizontal deflexion. On the basis of these and related data, it is suggested that we are dealing with at least two subtypes of ST. Finally, the patient's neuroticism and depression scale values are within the normal range and do not show significant correlations with ST duration. The present study provides no evidence that ST is a psychogenic disorder. ST should be regarded as a central nervous system disorder of unknown aetiology.\r"

In the present study the relationship of erythrocyte sorbitol and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) levels to peripheral nerve functions were investigated in 62 diabetic patients. Peroneal and median motor nerve conduction velocities, H-M intervals of the Hoffmann reflex, thermal discrimination thresholds and vibratory perception thresholds, either singly or in combination, were not significantly correlated with erythrocyte sorbitol or HbA1 levels. These findings show that a single measurement of erythrocyte sorbitol or HbA1 content cannot predict impairment of nerve function in diabetic subjects.\r"

  ".W": "This study compares two noninvasive techniques for monitoring the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) in 24 anesthetized adult patients. End-tidal PCO2 (PetCO2) and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) were simultaneously monitored and compared with arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) determined by intermittent analysis of arterial blood samples. PETCO2 and PtcCO2 values were compared with PaCO2 values corrected to patient body temperature (PaCO2T) and PaCO2 values determined at a temperature of 37 degrees C (PaCO2). Linear regression was performed along with calculations of the correlation coefficient (r), bias, and precision of the four paired variables: PETCO2 versus PaCO2 and PaCO2T (n = 211), and PtcCO2 versus PaCO2 and PaCO2T (n = 233). Bias is defined as the mean difference between paired values, whereas precision is the standard deviation of the difference. The following values were found for r, bias, and +/- precision, respectively. PETCO2 versus PaCO2: 0.67, -7.8 mm Hg, +/- 6.1 mm Hg; PETCO2 versus PaCO2T: 0.73, -5.8 mm Hg, +/- 5.9 mm Hg; PtcCO2 versus PaCO2: 0.87, -1.6 mm Hg, +/- 4.3 mm Hg; PtcCO2 versus PaCO2T: 0.84, +0.7 mm Hg, +/- 4.8 mm Hg. Although each of these PCO2 variables is physiologically different, there is a significant correlation (P less than 0.001) between the noninvasively monitored values and the blood gas values. Temperature correction of the arterial values (PaCO2T) slightly improved the correlation, with respect to PETCO2, but it had the opposite effect for PtcCO2. In this study, the chief distinction between these two noninvasive monitors was that PETCO2 had a large negative bias, whereas PtcCO2 had a small bias. We conclude from these data that PtcCO2 may be used to estimate PaCO2 with an accuracy similar to that of PETCO2 in anesthetized patients.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of cuff deflation rate in the auscultatory method of measuring blood pressure was investigated using a computer-based model. To determine the relationship between the cuff deflation rate and the measurement error, two cuff deflation protocols were used, one based on heart rate (mm Hg per heartbeat), the other on a constant rate (mm Hg per second). The different deflation protocols and rates were tested using a constant blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg and heart rates ranging from 40 to 120 beats/min. It was confirmed that a cuff deflation rate that is time based will introduce larger errors at low heart rates. Using heart rate as a basis for cuff deflation rate yields a constant error that is independent of heart rate. The currently used standard of 3 mm Hg/s could result in a maximum error of 2.5 mm Hg in both systolic and diastolic pressures at a heart rate of 72 beats/min. The maximum systolic and diastolic errors increase to more than 4 mm Hg at 40 beats/min. A deflation rate of 2 mm Hg/beat, however, yields a maximum error of 2 mm Hg for both systolic and diastolic pressures, independent of heart rate. A cuff deflation rate based on heart rate is recommended to help minimize changes in measurement error when measuring blood pressure if a wide range of heart rates will be encountered.\r"

As an aid in the differential diagnosis between brain tumor and abscess, the CRP levels were measured in 20 patients with intracranial mass lesions and the appearance of ring-like contrast enhancement on computerized tomography (CT) scans. In nine of these patients, the final diagnosis was abscess, based on either biopsy of the mass (eight patients) or the clinical course (one patient). In seven of the nine patients, there was a significant increase in CRP levels in two consecutive measurements. In particular, patients with cerebritis who were examined early in the course of the disease and who showed nonspecific CT scans exhibited extremely high levels of CRP. Two patients had no measurable CRP activity although they both had brain abscesses. In 12 patients harboring either gliomas or metastatic intracerebral tumors, CRP levels were significantly lower than those found in patients with brain abscesses but were nevertheless higher compared to those of a group of patients with benign tumors. It is concluded, therefore, that the measurement of CRP can have some value in the differential diagnosis between brain abscess and brain tumor. The measurement technique is inexpensive and is available in the clinical laboratories of most hospitals with a neurosurgical department.\r"

Of 41 patients whose CBF remained at levels regarded as adequate to prevent infarction (CBF greater than or equal to 0.2 ml/gm/min), the six who showed a cerebral infarction on computerized tomography (CT) scans exhibited characteristic cerebral metabolic patterns: a CMRO2 of less than 0.6 mumol/gm/min on one or more of the days monitored, and markedly elevated cerebral lactate production (CMRL less than -0.06 mumol/gm/min) on Days 1 and/or 2 after injury. Patients who had no areas of infarction on serial CT scans typically had a CMRO2 and CMRL can be obtained at the bedside and can indicate the presence of an evolving ischemic infarct after head injury.\r"

The CPP was either increased in 10-torr increments using norepinephrine or decreased by a combination of adenosine triphosphate and hemorrhage in subgroups. Three estimations of PVI were made at each level of CPP. The PaCO2, body temperature, and hematocrit were controlled at normal levels throughout. In both groups there was a linear relationship between PVI and CPP with increasing CPP being reflected by a rise in PVI. This relationship was more marked in the methohexital group: PVI = 0.37 ml + 0.0005 mm Hg CPP in the pentobarbital group, and PVI = 0.14 ml + 0.0019 mm Hg CPP in the methohexital group. These results indicate that the PVI is not independent of CPP but is a function of CPP and is profoundly influenced by anesthesia.\r"

Within this range, the PVI varied directly with CPP (PVI = 0.24 ml + 0.0013 mm Hg CPP). Below the autoregulatory range, CBF fell progressively with further decreases in CPP; in this range, PVI was found to increase as CPP fell (PVI = 0.84 ml - 0.0071 mm Hg CPP). These results indicate that the PVI is a complex function of CPP, varying directly with CPP within the autoregulatory range and indirectly with CPP below the autoregulatory range.\r"

Threshold lactate rose at an average cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 49 torr, and, in general, preceded a threshold decrease in phosphocreatine, which was observed at an average CPP of 29 torr. There was considerable variation among cats in the CPP at which failure of brain energy metabolism occurred, however, suggesting differences in the autoregulatory curves. It is concluded that, with elevated ICP, there is no universally \"safe\" CPP at which brain energy metabolism may be assumed to be uncompromised.\r"

An epidural balloon was inflated at regular intervals at three levels of arterial CO2 tension (25, 35, and 50 mm Hg) before and after the administration of nimodipine, and volume-pressure curves were generated. In every case, curves generated after intravenous nimodipine infusion were lower and shifted more to the right than the same set of curves generated before nimodipine administration, regardless of the baseline ICP. The reduction in ICP following nimodipine infusion was not due to a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and was statistically significant at all three levels of pCO2 (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that, in the presence of elevated ICP due to cerebral infarction, there is no increased risk of exacerbating intracranial hypertension with the addition of nimodipine.\r"

  ".U": "87282641\r", 
  ".W": "Nimodipine, a dihydropyridine that interacts with a Ca++ channel-associated binding site, when delivered (30 to 150 micrograms/kg) intra-arterially (ia) to enflurane-anesthetized cats, produced a dose-dependent suppression of seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazol. A comparable suppression was produced by clonazepam (1 to 30 micrograms/kg, ia). Phenytoin was maximally effective only at nearly lethal doses (90 mg/kg, ia). Verapamil, a diphenylalkylamine that interacts with a separate Ca++ channel-associated site, at the maximum nonlethal dose (6 mg/kg, ia) resulted in a mild facilitation of seizure activity. The drug vehicle used in these studies (50% polyethylene glycol-400) had no effect when given alone. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by the clearance of xenon-133 was markedly elevated immediately after the onset of seizure activity (89 +/- 3 to 168 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min). Concurrent with their resolution of the seizure activity, both nimodipine and clonazepam reduced rCBF to near preseizure levels and preserved the rCBF response to hypercarbia which would otherwise have been abolished following prolonged seizure activity. Moreover, the effect of nimodipine on rCBF and seizures occurred without any prominent alterations in mean arterial blood pressure as compared to preseizure levels. These data support the proposition that a dihydropyridine Ca++ channel binding site may play a role in modulating paroxysmal neuronal activity, and suggest that this class of agents may reflect a novel group of antiepileptic drugs.\r"

  ".U": "87282643\r", 
  ".W": "Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with radiolabeled microspheres in a canine model of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass and acute ischemia. Ischemic zone flows in seven dogs with the bypass first closed and then open showed no significant contribution of bypass flow in the intact vascular system. Following acute proximal occlusion, rCBF was preserved by bypass flow. A significant flow decrease ensued when the bypass was then clipped, confirming the adequacy of the lesion and the protective effect of the bypass. Reopening the bypass after 15 minutes of ischemia restored 76% of the previous flow. This was a significant increase from the global ischemia values, and was not statistically different from preocclusive values. Preocclusion somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) in these animals showed a consistent biphasic wave at 8 to 10 msec after stimulation. This wave, with some decrease in amplitude, was preserved by bypass flow following creation of the arterial lesion. Bypass clipping abolished these ipsilateral SSEP's. Variable return of SSEP's occurred following reopening of the graft, but the recordings never reached preischemic amplitudes. This experimental study shows that, in this model, a prophylactic bypass subjected to immediate demand (with no time for \"maturation\") can adequately augment cortical rCBF and is superior to delayed revascularization. The data lend theoretical support to placement of a prophylactic STA-MCA bypass prior to elective carotid artery sacrifice or in surgery where the risk of acute vascular injury is high.\r"

The nerve stumps were reapproximated and affixed with a plasma clot in Group I animals and were separated by a gap in Group II animals. Visceral eye motility was evaluated weekly between 1 day and 40 weeks after surgery by recording the pupillary diameter under standardized photic stimulation. Somatic eye motility was assessed after 26 weeks by measuring the ocular displacement evoked by vestibular stimulation in the horizontal and vertical planes. Nerve regeneration was documented histologically and morphometrically at 8, 16, and 40 weeks after section. The selectivity of axonal regeneration to the extraocular muscles was investigated after 26 weeks by mapping (with injection of retrograde horseradish peroxidase) the motoneurons that supplied each reinnervated muscle. Between 6 and 20 weeks after section, the pupil diameter showed a progressive reduction in Group I rats, and no changes were observed in Group II rats. Compared with normal rats, the amplitude of horizontal and vertical ocular displacements was decreased, respectively, by 30% and 45% in Group I and by 65% and 80% in Group II. In Group I rats, the vestibular stimulation in the horizontal plane evoked anomalous eye movements with vertical components. On histological examination, regenerated nerves showed a progressive increase of axonal diameter and myelin-sheath thickness. Reinnervated muscles were associated with a less specific, bilateral representation in the midbrain compared with normal muscles, which have unilateral representation. The changes of the somatotopic organization were interpreted as being the result of the misdirected regrowth of axons in the postlesional nerve stump and of the collateral sprouting in the midbrain.\r"

Whether the presence of radiotracer activity in the region of sagittal venous sinus (SVS) represents actual blood flow to the brain in the absence of demonstrable cerebral arterial flow remains a controversial issue. Our retrospective study was performed to review the significance of such sagittal tracer activity. Of the 53 patients showing no cerebral arterial flow, 26 showed tracer activity in the region of SVS. The clinical status, EEG findings, and outcome of all 53 patients were the same irrespective of the presence or absence of SVS tracer activity.

These molecules have been used in this preliminary investigation to improve the targeting of 111In in animals. Antibodies have been conjugated with biotin and administered unlabeled while, at a later time, the radiolabel was administered attached to DTPA-coupled avidin or streptavidin. An alternative procedure was also considered whereby the antibodies were conjugated with avidin and administered before the administration of radiolabeled biotin. Using a model in which the target consisted of conjugated agarose beads deposited in the peritoneum of mice, it has been shown that the target/nontarget radioactivity ratios may be significantly improved with respect to the conventional procedures through the use of this approach.\r"

  ".W": "A technique for noninvasive determination of cardiac output by aid of first-pass radionuclide cardiography is described. After intravenous injection of 10-15 mCi technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled red blood cells the method requires acquisition of a first passage time-activity curve recorded with a gamma camera over the left ventricle, the background corrected left ventricular count rate recorded after complete mixing of the tracer in the circulation, and determination of the distribution volume of the tracer. The method was applied in 14 patients with heart disease of various origins and evaluated against the conventional tracer dilution technique with arterial sampling of blood activity. Cardiac output determinations by external counting ranged from 2.30 to 8.56 l/min, mean +/- s.d. 4.50 +/- 1.66 l/min and by arterial blood sampling from 1.88 to 8.96 l/min, mean +/- s.d. 4.52 +/- 1.71 l/min. An excellent correlation was demonstrated between the two techniques, r = 0.978 (p less than 0.001). When no background subtraction was applied to the left ventricular counts at equilibrium, radionuclide cardiac output values were approximately 40% higher than those obtained by arterial sampling. The new first-pass radionuclide cardiographic technique may prove a useful tool in the noninvasive evaluation of cardiac function, especially in patients with arrhythmias and/or valvular incompetence.\r"

This estimate is usually obtained from an externally detected blood-pool curve that is calibrated with a single plasma sample. However, external probes detect activity in the extravascular as well as the intravascular space. This may lead to significant errors in estimating the plasma time-activity curve. A method for overcoming this problem by using a continuously varying calibration factor based upon multiple plasma samples was therefore evaluated. Externally detected blood-pool curves were used to estimate the plasma time-activity curves obtained from rabbits during radionuclide renography. Estimates obtained using the externally detected curves calibrated with a constant calibration factor were found to be significantly biased, while estimates obtained using the externally detected curves calibrated with the continuously varying calibration factor were not.\r"

Three groups of chickens were depleted of essential fatty acids by feeding diets containing 1% hydrogenated coconut oil from hatching to 8 wk, followed by repletion for 3 wk with diets containing soybean oil (SBO) and linseed oil (LSO) separately or in combination. The ratio of linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) to linolenic acid (18:3 omega 3) was 7.48, 1.17 or 0.32, respectively, for diets containing 10% SBO, 5% SBO/5% LSO or 10% LSO. A 10% SBO diet fed for 11 wk served as the control. Production of prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin E, thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha by incubated lung was lower in birds fed linseed oil, with total prostanoid production being 95, 42 and 22% of control values for the three dietary treatments, respectively. The ratio of arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) to linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) in serum phospholipids followed a similar pattern for the three treatments, with values of 0.96, 0.52 and 0.21. Thus, production of lung prostanoids of the 2-series could be modulated by varying the dietary omega 6/omega 3 ratio. This effect may be due in part to depression of phospholipid arachidonate, the precursor of 2-series eicosanoids.\r"

The high dose of caffeine was compared to an equimolar dose of theophylline (1.39 g/kg diet) in both Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats. Urinary calcium excretion in theophylline-treated rats was significantly greater than in caffeine-treated rats on all sampling days and in both strains of rat; the calciuric effect lasted at least 22 d. When rats were given indomethacin (3.3 mg/kg diet) the calciuria induced by caffeine and theophylline was abolished, and sodium excretion in all groups was reduced by 35-50%, but urine volume was unchanged. The calciuria of methylxanthine feeding may result from a prostaglandin-mediated process distinct from diuresis.\r"

Cell-free systems consisting of polyribosomes and fractions, enriched with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for incorporation of amino acids into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble proteins, were prepared from livers of three populations of rats: 1) rats fed ad libitum a diet containing 25 ppm zinc; 2) rats fed a diet containing less than 1 ppm zinc; and 3) rats pair fed to the zinc-deficient group a diet containing 25 ppm zinc. Group 2 showed typical signs of zinc deficiency, including decreased bone zinc. The protein synthetic ability of systems isolated from zinc-deficient rats was considerably depressed, resulting in incorporation of 59-69% of the amino acids incorporated by systems from pair-fed rats and 54-59% of those incorporated by ad libitum-fed control animals. This effect was significant after only 14 d of the dietary regimen. Experiments performed by mixing polyribosomes and synthetase fractions from the different groups indicated that a defect is located in the synthetase fraction. Acylation of tRNA by the synthetase fraction also was assayed and found to be 69-90% of that in zinc-sufficient preparations. It is suggested that one or more of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes from the rat liver may be zinc dependent.\r"

  ".W": "Brush border membrane vesicles and everted rings of rat jejunum were used to study the absorption of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid, the alpha-hydroxy analog of methionine (DL-MHA). Uptake by membrane vesicles was found to be unaltered by an inwardly directed sodium gradient in contrast to that of L-methionine, D-methionine and L-lactate, which is sodium stimulated and exhibits a characteristic \"overshoot\" phenomenon. Initial uptake rates of both L- and D-methionine (0.77 mM) were respectively 6.8 and 1.5 times higher than that of DL-MHA (0.80 mM) under Na+-gradient conditions. However, the hydroxy analog significantly inhibited L-lactate accumulation into membrane vesicles. Uptake of DL-MHA into rat jejunal rings was the sum of a saturable Michaelian component [KappM = 4.4 mM and Vappmax = 587 nmol/(g X min)] and a diffusive component [Kd = 47 microL/(g X min)]. Furthermore, L-lactate completely inhibited the carrier-mediated uptake of DL-MHA. All this demonstrates that jejunal uptake of DL-MHA in the rat is mediated by an Na+-independent carrier system associated with L-lactate transport and thus is quite distinct from the L-methionine pathway. This difference could help explain numerous findings with respect to a lower biological utilization of the hydroxy analog in some species when fed as the sole source of methionine in purified crystalline amino acid diets.\r"

  ".W": "Lactating rats have been fed either a protein-restricted diet (10 vs. 20% casein in the control diet) or the control diet at 80, 60 and 40% of the voluntary intake for 7 d from d 7 of lactation. Food consumption, changes in maternal live weight, litter live weight gain and the mass of several maternal tissues were determined together with the activity of several mammary and liver enzymes, including 10 that are essential for fatty acid and complex lipid synthesis. Milk production was estimated from the litter weight gain and litter weight. Lactating rats fed the 20% protein diet ad libitum consumed three times that of nonlactating rats; their liver and kidney masses were significantly higher and their adipose mass was lower. The livers of the lactating rats were fatty, containing 118 mg lipid/g compared with 42 mg/g for the nonlactating rats. Lactating rats fed either the protein-restricted diet or the control diet at 40 and 60% of the ad libitum intake of the control diet had lower mammary, liver and kidney masses than rats consuming the control diet ad libitum. Both protein and food restriction led to lower rates of milk production than those of ad libitum-fed control rats as evidenced by the decrease in litter live weight gains. The concentrations of total lipid, total protein and lactose in milk were not affected by these dietary treatments. The concentration of alpha-lactalbumin in milk of rats fed the low protein diet was, however, lower than that in the milk of all rats receiving the control diet, irrespective of intake. Consumption of the restricted diets resulted in only small changes in specific activities (mu/mg protein) of 15 mammary enzymes. In the livers, lactation led to higher specific activities of all four soluble lipogenic enzymes examined but did not affect the particulate enzymes involved in complex lipid synthesis. The dietary restrictions resulted in lower specific activities of the soluble enzymes compared with those of the lactating rats consuming the control diet ad libitum without affecting the particulate enzymes. Total activities of these enzymes were, however, lower than those for the control rats as a result of the smaller liver mass in the rats receiving the restricted diets.\r"

During cycles 11-15 (343-464 days after weaning), 17 of 24 rats (71%) developed tumor-like masses in the connective tissue surrounding the formative ends of one or both upper incisor teeth. The masses were composed of cords of odontogenic epithelium surrounded by a mantle of mesenchyme. Lakes of predentine, associated with foci of keratinized epithelium, were randomly distributed. On the basis of current understanding of odontogenesis, we propose that periodically disturbed differentiation of pulpal mesenchymal cells to dentin-secreting odontoblasts was pivotal to development of the masses. During deficiency, dentin secretion is impaired, the dentin wall perforates and with time the odontogenic epithelium and pulp herniate into the surrounding connective tissues. We propose that the incisal masses arose because the pulpal mesenchyme continued to grow and its secretion product, dentine, continued to be deposited (during periods of vitamin A sufficiency) in an ectopic site where functional attrition from mastication could not occur.\r"

Activities of peroxisomal fatty acyl-coenzyme (CoA) oxidase and catalase as well as mitochondrial citrate synthase were assayed in liver tissue of 24 young adult male and female Wistar rats fed a nonpurified diet containing 0.6% DHEA (6 g/kg) for 6 wk. DHEA-treated animals gained less weight but had heavier liver weights than did the controls. Hepatic activity of fatty acyl-CoA oxidase of the experimental male and female animal was 1058 and 946% higher, respectively, than that of the controls. For catalase activity, only the female groups were different (30%). Activity of citrate synthase was not affected by DHEA. These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of DHEA on energy storage as fat is mediated, at least in part, by increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisomes. The peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway is uncoupled from oxidative phosphorylation; electrons are transferred directly to molecular O2 because of cycling of NAD/NADH resulting in the expenditure of chemical energy as heat.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) concentration has been suggested as a valid indicator to assess vitamin B-6 nutritional status. Animal and human studies have shown that plasma PLP concentrations decrease progressively during pregnancy and large doses of vitamin B-6 supplementation are required to maintain plasma PLP at early or prepregnant levels. PLP is known to be hydrolyzed to pyridoxal (PL) by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), resulting in an inverse relationship between PLP and ALP. The object of this study was to compare the PLP-PL equilibrium in a group of healthy pregnant females with that of an age-matched nonpregnant control group from a similar socioeconomic background. The mean plasma PLP level was 37% lower, (P less than 0.0001), whereas the mean PL level was almost 90% higher (P less than 0.001) in the pregnant group than in the nonpregnant control group. The total amount of plasma PLP and PL levels, however, did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.24) between the two groups. Because the PL vitamer is regarded as the ultimate transport form of vitamin B-6, it may serve as a readily available source of vitamin B-6 to meet possible increased metabolic demands. Therefore, the estimation of plasma PLP alone does not permit an accurate assessment or understanding of the nutritional status and the physiology of vitamin B-6 in conditions associated with altered vitamin B-6 homeostases.\r"

One difficulty with this approach is that we are dealing with an integral metabolite rather than a foreign substance. It is thought that the ideal place for inhibition of synthesis would be a water-soluble intermediate between hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) and squalene. Several inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis that acted in later stages showed an increase of a new steroid in the blood that usually accumulated at the stage of inhibition. A few of these compounds have also been shown to be teratogenic for rats. Currently there is a new generation of inhibitors whose site of action is at HMG CoA reductase. Fortunately, at this writing no serious side effects have been reported.\r"

The 30 topics were equally divided among clinical, research and cost-containment categories. The 29 housestaff and the 41 subspecialty faculty members clearly favored clinical and research topics over cost-containment topics (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, the nine general internists considered the cost-containment topics as attractive as the clinical and research topics and ranked them higher than did both the subspecialists (p less than 0.001) and the house-staff (p less than 0.05). Efforts to alter costs in academic medical centers may be hampered by the relative disinterest in cost-containment education among house officers and subspecialists, who are responsible for most of the health care delivery in this setting.\r"

The intervention included mailings of information, appointment reminders, and intense follow-up by telephone of visit failures for rescheduling. Eight hundred fifty-four patients receiving drug therapy for diabetes mellitus were stratified by risk of nonelective hospitalization and randomly assigned to the control group or the intervention group. After two years, the intervention group averaged 9.1 per cent more kept scheduled visits per month than the control group (0.371 vs. 0.340, p = 0.02). However, the mean incidence of nonelective hospitalizations per month was not significantly different between intervention and control groups (0.040 vs. 0.041, p = 0.9), nor was there a difference in nonelective hospital days per month (0.443 vs. 0.425, p = 0.7). The authors conclude that while mailings and telephone calls can increase office visits, the intervention is not sufficient to reduce morbidity necessitating nonelective hospitalizations of diabetic patients.\r"

Although respondents reported a great diversity of work roles, attitudes, and values, there was a strong and consistent tendency to value and want to improve upon only those skills related to basic activities in which physicians were already spending more time. Also, physicians who spent more time in direct patient care were significantly less likely to value classroom teaching or research, less likely to be doing teaching or research, and less motivated to improve their skills in those activities. Likewise, faculty who spent more time doing research were less interested in improving their patient care skills. The implications of these findings for meeting current and future manpower needs of divisions of general internal medicine are discussed.\r"

Of the 102 children evaluated, the chest radiograph resulted in a change of the pre-x-ray diagnosis in 21% and pre-x-ray management plans in 16%. In the majority of these cases, a diagnosis previously considered less likely was \"ruled in\" or therapy was instituted rather than withheld. More important, when the pattern of decision making was consistent, with the initial diagnosis and the need for a chest radiograph remaining the same throughout all phases, the chest radiograph resulted in a change of pre-x-ray diagnosis in five (10%) of 48 patients, compared with a change in 16 (30%) of 54 when the pattern was inconsistent (P less than 0.02). Similarly, when the pattern was consistent, the pre-x-ray management was modified in only three (6%) of 48 patients versus 13 (24%) of 54 inconsistent cases (P less than 0.015). Chest radiographs are least useful when information from sequential observation, history, and physical examination is consistent in suggesting the same diagnosis and need for a chest radiograph. Radiographs appear to have greater impact on diagnosis and management when any inconsistencies arise.\r"

Abnormalities on the first two CT scans included subdural effusion in eight patients, focal infarction in five, and pus in the basal cisterns in one. All patients with focal infarction or cisternal pus had hemiparesis. Marked cerebral edema was seen in the two patients who died. Transient mild dilation of the subarachnoid space was a common finding; the size of the ventricles or subarachnoid space was increased on the second scan in 29 of 36 patients, and decreased to normal on the third scan in 30 of 33 patients.

Home maintenance of this equipment was also evaluated for its relationship to contamination. In nine of 36 patients, Pseudomonas species were isolated from one or more pieces of home equipment. Only patients colonized with P. aeruginosa had contaminated equipment. P. aeruginosa was recovered from equipment used by five patients; no P. cepacia was recovered. Aerosolization masks were the most commonly contaminated pieces of equipment (20%), followed by nebulizers (17%), medication syringes (10%), connective tubing (6%), and saline solution (4%). Nebulizers and syringes were significantly more likely to be contaminated if they had been in use for 1 month or longer; nebulizers and masks were more likely to be contaminated if they were cleaned or were rinsed only with tap water after use. We conclude that equipment may serve as a reservoir to reintroduce or perpetuate colonization of some patients with CF, but that contamination of equipment with P. aeruginosa is not common.\r"

Colonized infants, compared with noncolonized infants, had younger mean gestational age (32.4 vs 35.2 weeks, P less than 0.01), lower mean birth weight (1.76 vs 2.31 kg, P less than 0.01), a longer stay in hospital (Wilcoxon P less than 0.01), and more mean days use of an incubator (12.7 vs 7.6 days, P less than 0.01), lamb wool (12.9 vs 8.2 days, P less than 0.01), paper tape (10.8 vs 8.2 days, P less than 0.01), and Op-Site tape (14.1 vs 10.1 days, P less than 0.01).

To explore extent to which urea ingested in milk becomes bioavailable, we fed di-15N-urea (both nitrogen atoms in the form of the stable isotope 15N) and determined urinary excretion of di-15N-urea (excreted without having become bioavailable) and mono-15N-urea (urea containing only one atom of 15N and therefore reflecting excretion of absorbed ammonia). The largest percentage of the ingested di-15N-urea was excreted promptly in the urine still in the form of di-15N-urea. We conclude that most of the urea ingested by a normal infant is not bioavailable.\r"

All infant measurements showed positive and significant correlations with body surface area, weight, length, and gestational age (P less than 0.001). However, the anogenital ratio (AF/AC) followed a normal distribution and did not correlate with any of the anthropometric variables or age. Mean (+/- SD) value in infants was 0.37 +/- 0.07, and in adults, 0.36 +/- 0.07. An anogenital ratio greater than 0.50 falls outside the 95% confidence limits, suggests labioscrotal fusion, and indicates a need for further evaluation. Because it is independent of body size and gestational age, the anogenital ratio should be useful in diagnosing androgen-induced labioscrotal fusion in both premature and full-term female infants.\r"

Sixteen small for gestational age infants, 21 infants of mothers with preeclampsia, and 13 symptomatic infants of diabetic mothers had significantly higher transferrin levels and lower ferritin levels and calculated iron stores than did asymptomatic gestational age-matched control infants without these conditions. Cord ferritin levels and calculated iron stores were significantly lower in the infants of diabetic mothers than in any other group of infants. Cord transferrin levels were inversely correlated with ferritin levels (r = -0.59, P less than 0.001) and were unrelated to transthyretin levels and birth weight in the high-risk infants, but were positively correlated with ferritin levels (r = 0.50, P less than 0.001), transthyretin levels (r = 0.65, P less than 0.001), and birth weight (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001) in the control infants. We conclude that cord transferrin levels do not reflect protein-energy status in newborn infants with prenatal histories suggesting uteroplacental insufficiency or chronic hypoxia, and that when associated with decreased cord ferritin levels, indicate possible impaired iron stores in these infants.\r"

A highly significant association (P less than 0.0001) between maternal and infant birth weights was found for both blacks and whites. Women who weighed 4000 to 4499 g at birth were at lowest risk for delivery of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant (5.9% for whites, 4.8% for blacks). The risk of giving birth to an SGA infant increased with decreasing maternal birth weight, reaching a maximum of 19.8% for white mothers who weighed 2000 to 2499 g at birth, and 20.0% for black mothers who weighed 1000 to 1499 g at birth. In contrast, the rate of preterm birth varied much less by maternal birth weight for both whites and blacks. These data suggest that maternal birth weight exerts a stronger influence on intrauterine growth than on the duration of gestation. Women who were smaller than average at birth should be considered at high risk for delivery of an SGA infant.\r"

In the present study we characterized the agonist and opioid antagonist profile of CTP in analgesic (hot-plate test, abdominal stretch test) and in gastrointestinal assays (transit time test) in mice. CTP was a potent antagonist of the supraspinal and spinal analgesic effects of the mu selective agonist [MePhe3, D-Pro4]morphiceptin (PL017) in both assays. The gastrointestinal antitransit actions of PL017 were also antagonized by CTP at both supraspinal and spinal sites. CTP did not alter the effects of the kappa agonist trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrolidinyl)cyclohexyl)benz eneacetamine in any test. Surprisingly, CTP also antagonized the analgesia produced by i.c.v. and intrathecal administration of [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), a highly delta selective agonist, in both analgesic tests. Differential antagonism of DPDPE, but not PL017, by the delta selective antagonist N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH in the hot-plate test indicates that PL017 and DPDPE may act at separate receptors to produce analgesia (mu and delta, respectively). In contrast, CTP did not reverse the gastrointestinal antitransit effects of intrathecal DPDPE. Schild analysis of the interactions of CTP with supraspinal mu and delta agonists in the hot-plate test indicated that although CTP antagonized PL017 in a competitive fashion (Schild slope = -1.0), the interaction of CTP with DPDPE was not competitive (Schild slope = -0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 14 dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 2 hr, followed by a 4-hr period of reperfusion. In 7 of the 14 dogs, 1 mg/kg of propranolol was administered 10 min before and again 2 hr after reperfusion. Small artery and vein O2 saturations obtained microspectrophotometrically were combined with regional blood flow measurements using radioactive microspheres to determine regional myocardial O2 consumption. In both groups, 2 hr of occlusion lowered the regional flow to a similar level. In the control group, 4 hr of reperfusion returned the blood flow toward normal levels, from 17 +/- 20 ml/min/100 g (mean +/- S.D.) at the end of occlusion to 60 +/- 42 ml/min/100 g in the affected area compared with 84 +/- 28 ml/min/100 g in the nonischemic area. In the propranolol-treated animals, the flow increase with reperfusion was not significant (25 +/- 30 ml/min/100 g to 45 +/- 26 ml/min/100 g). O2 extraction was greater in the ischemic than in the unaffected area in both groups. However, ischemic region O2 extraction was lower in the propranolol-treated group than in the control group. There were a greater number of arteries and veins with reduced O2 saturations in the control group reperfused area compared with the nonischemic area. Propranolol decreased the number of low O2 saturation vessels in the ischemic area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of agonist and antagonist interactions with the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptor were studied in the isolated rabbit aorta by following the antagonist-induced decrease in the steady-state response to an agonist. A model describing the competitive drug-receptor interactions was fitted to the data and yielded estimates of the association and dissociation rate constants of the agonist and the antagonist. A high concentration of the agonist ([agonist] much greater than KA) was used to reduce the influence of antagonist diffusion to the receptor upon the onset of antagonism. The effect of a diffusion barrier was evaluated by comparing the kinetics of drug competition in the absence and in the presence of the adventitia. The rate constants of the high-affinity antagonists spiperone, methysergide or ketanserin were similar in the absence and in the presence of the adventitia. In contrast, the rate constants of the low affinity antagonist 5-methoxygramine were reduced almost 5-fold in the presence of the adventitia. This observation may be explained by the large partition coefficients of the high-affinity antagonists as compared to the relatively low partition coefficient of 5-methoxygramine. The ratios of the estimated rate constants (k-x/kx) are in good agreement with the dissociation constants of the drugs determined with steady-state methods. In addition the results suggest that the association rate constant is a primary determinant of drug affinity for the receptor. The kinetic rate constants of the high-affinity antagonists measured in this preparation are similar to those previously reported in high-affinity binding studies. We conclude that the kinetic parameters obtained in our experiments reflect primarily the molecular interactions of these drugs with the receptor.\r"

Basal levels of dopamine release were greatly decreased in the frontal cortex and caudate putamen after the injection of CGS 15855A or apomorphine. The pargyline-induced accumulations of 3-methoxytyramine in the frontal cortex, cingulate cortex and caudate putamen were attenuated by 52 to 82% after the injection of either agonist. 3-Methoxytyramine accumulations in the entorhinal cortex were attenuated by 68% by apomorphine. Thus, as in the caudate putamen, dopamine autoreceptors modulate the in vivo release of dopamine in the frontal cortex and the turnover of the releasable dopamine pool in the frontal, cingulate and entorhinal cortices.\r"

A series of catecholimidazolines (CI) and catecholamidines (CA) were compared with the EPI series for the relationship of stereoisomerism to potency, affinity and efficacy. Within each group of desoxy compound and stereoisomers obtained by -OH substitution at the benzylic position, differences in potency were found to be due solely to differences in affinity; differences in efficacy were not significant. The stereoisomers of the CI and CA series followed the order of potency predicted by the Easson-Stedman model: (-)-isomer greater than (+)-isomer. The desoxy analogs, in contrast to the prediction based on the Easson-Stedman hypothesis, were equal (CI) or greater (CA) in potency than the more potent (-)-isomer of each series. Possible explanations for this include differences in physical properties in the desoxy analogs of CI and CA compared with the corresponding enantiomers. Methyl or benzyl substitution at C-4 of the imidazoline ring decreased potency over 100-fold; potency differences between enantiomers were negligible. Thus, the Easson-Stedman model cannot be extended to either the CI or CA series of alpha adrenoreceptor agonists.\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies have demonstrated that intensive treatment with high doses of methylprednisolone (MP) can beneficially affect the acutely injured central nervous system by a variety of mechanisms and promote neurological recovery in experimentally injured animals. In view of the fact that these actions are associated only with MP doses greatly in excess of those required for classical glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions of the steroid, the possibility was examined that this high-dose pharmacology of MP could be duplicated by a nonglucocorticoid analog. Accordingly, U-72099E (17,21-dihydroxy-11 alpha-t-butylacetoxy-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione- 21-hemisuccinate, sodium salt) was synthesized and tested for its ability to duplicate the high-dose effects of MP in a concussive head injury model in mice and in an in vitro model of lipid peroxidation-induced membrane damage using rat brain synaptosomes. The absence of glucocorticoid-related activity of U-72099E was confirmed by its inability to either suppress body weight gain or cause thymic involution in mice treated with doses up to 100 mg/kg/day for 4 days. On the other hand, MP at 30 mg/kg/day for 4 days caused a complete inhibition of body weight gain and a 43.5% reduction in thymus weight. Moreover, U-72099E, at concentrations of 10(-5) M or lower, failed to suppress adrenocorticotropin secretion by mouse AtT-20 pituitary cells in culture, whereas dexamethasone or MP at concentrations of 10(-6) M and lower caused a marked suppression in adrenocorticotropin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of central and peripheral arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the cardiovascular action of LY171555 in conscious rats, we have examined the effects of LY171555 on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma AVP and catecholamine levels in conscious, congenitally AVP-deficient Brattleboro (DI) rats and Long-Evans (LE) control rats. Administration of LY171555 (1 mg/kg i.v.) increased heart rate without altering mean arterial pressure in DI rats but increased both mean arterial pressure and heart rate in LE rats. After pretreatment with domperidone, LY171555 induced both a pressure response and a tachycardia in DI rats. Domperidone pretreatment enhanced the pressor action of LY171555 and attenuated the LY171555-induced tachycardia in LE rats. After pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, LY171555 induced a depressor and bradycardic response that could be blocked by pretreatment with domperidone in DI rats. Pressor and bradycardic responses to LY171555 were attenuated by phenoxybenzamine pretreatment in LE rats. LY171555 administration increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels in both DI and LE rats but increased plasma AVP only in LE rats. The vasopressor effect of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine was significantly attenuated in DI rats compared with LE rats, whereas the pressor action of angiotensin II was similar in both groups. These results suggest that the pressor action of LY171555 in conscious LE rats is mediated by an increase in plasma AVP and by activation of sympathetic outflow through the central D2 dopaminergic system but not through the central vasopressinergic system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mathematical modeling demonstrated the presence of three classes of binding sites, corresponding to mu, delta and the putative mu-1 classes of site. Unlabeled naloxonazine shows high affinity for all three classes of sites, with highest affinity for the mu-1 sites. Membranes were preincubated with 50 nM naloxonazine or with controls (50 nM naloxone or buffer) for 30 min. Preincubation of membranes with 50 nM naloxonazine resulted in a dramatic, nearly 2-fold reduction in the binding of [3H][D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-enkephalin and [3H][D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin relative to the controls. Quantitative analyses using mathematical modeling with program \"LIGAND\" suggested that this effect was primarily \"competitive,\" i.e., attributable to changes in affinity, with no apparent or detectable noncompetitive or irreversible effects on binding capacities for the three classes of sites.\r"

  ".W": "Severely ill patients often do not eat or cannot retain ingested food. Malnutrition occurs frequently in hospitalized individuals and is known to be associated with substantial changes in the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs. On the other hand, little is known about the effect of acute starvation or malnutrition on the pharmacodynamics (concentration-effect relationship) of drugs. To explore the effects of acute starvation on the pharmacodynamics of drugs that depress or stimulate the central nervous system, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were deprived of food (but not water) for 3 days, whereas control animals had free access to food and water. Slow i.v. infusion of phenobarbital to onset of loss of righting reflex showed that the starved animals required a larger body weight normalized dose and that they had higher phenobarbital concentrations in serum, serum water, brain and cerebrospinal fluid at the pharmacologic endpoint. Refeeding of the rats for 2 or 7 days did not normalize the decreased body weight and serum total protein concentration. The starvation-associated decrease in the sensitivity of the central nervous system to the hypnotic effect of phenobarbital was only reversed slightly by refeeding for 2 days and persisted even after 7 days of refeeding. Acute starvation had no apparent effect on the dose of i.v. infused ethanol required to cause loss of righting reflex and on ethanol concentrations in serum, brain and cerebrospinal fluid at that time. The infused dose and the concentrations of pentylenetetrazol in serum, brain and cerebrospinal fluid at onset of maximal seizures did not differ significantly between starved and control (fed) rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was undertaken to characterize more fully this action by examining the effects of (R)-NAEE in a number of pharmacological and biochemical tests of cholinergic action. (R)-NAEE was found to produce negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on the guinea pig atria (pD2 = 5.91 and 5.62, respectively), and was capable of stimulating contractions in the guinea pig ileum (pD2 = 5.95) and rat jejunum (pD2 = 5.40) at concentrations similar to bethanechol. Both the cardiac and intestinal effects of (R)-NAEE were reversed by atropine. Moreover, (R)-NAEE competed with N-[3H]methylscopolamine and [3H]pirenzepine for muscarinic binding sites in a variety of tissues. Like carbachol, (R)-NAEE inhibited GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat striatal membranes (EC50 = 52 microM), whereas, unlike carbachol, (R)-NAEE was unable to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation in rat cerebral cortical slices, behaving as an antagonist in this latter system (pA2 = 5.0). The results indicate that (R)-NAEE interacts directly with cholinergic muscarinic receptors, being an agonist for the M2 subtype and an antagonist at M1 sites.\r"

Rates of responding were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by the (-)-isomer of 6N-[1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]-adenosine (PIA) under both schedules. Caffeine shifted the (-)-PIA dose-effect curve to the right in a dose-dependent manner. Single administrations of 15.0 mg/kg of caffeine had (-)-PIA-antagonist effects for up to 48 hr. Caffeine administered alone increased rates of responding at intermediate doses, and decreased rates at the highest doses. The increases in response rates produced by intermediate doses of caffeine were appreciably diminished at 24 hr. Doses of (-)-PIA that were inactive when administered alone had little effect on the increases in response rate produced by caffeine. Doses of (-)-PIA that decreased response rates when administered alone attenuated the increase in response rates produced by caffeine. Increases in response rates produced by (+)-amphetamine were altered by (-)-PIA similarly to the manner in which (-)-PIA altered the effects of caffeine. Increases in response rates produced by caffeine were altered by chlorpromazine similarly to the manner in which (-)-PIA altered effects of caffeine. When caffeine was administered daily, as one 15.0-mg/kg injection after experimental sessions, tolerance developed to the response rate increasing effects of caffeine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Norepinephrine-induced contraction was associated with increased accumulation of the hydrolytic products of the phosphatidylinositols, inositol monophosphate and phosphatidic acid. Norepinephrine also induced significant decreases in phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. The alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, exposure to the Ca++ channel modulator, nifedipine, and removal of extracellular Ca++ inhibited the accumulation of inositol monophosphate and contraction due to norepinephrine. These results suggest that the contraction induced by norepinephrine may be mediated by processes associated with hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositols. The hydrolysis may occur through Ca++-dependent activation of phospholipase C by alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists.\r"

Morphine and naltrexone occasioned responding on the injection-appropriate keys at doses greater than or equal to 32.0 and 0.032 mg/kg, respectively. Termination of morphine injections also produced naltrexone-appropriate responding, suggesting that the withdrawal-precipitating actions of naltrexone account for its discriminative stimulus effects in morphine-treated pigeons. The potency of morphine as a discriminative stimulus was similar in 30-hr morphine-abstinent pigeons and in pigeons that had received morphine 6 hr before testing. The opioid antagonists naloxone, nalmefene and diprenorphine substituted as discriminative stimuli for naltrexone at doses greater than or equal to 0.032 mg/kg. Nalorphine, a mixed agonist-antagonist, also substituted for naltrexone, but only at doses larger than 10.0 mg/kg. The mixed agonist-antagonist pentazocine failed to substitute for either training drug; the opioid agonist levorphanol substituted completely for morphine. Naltrexone was 1000 times more potent as a discriminative stimulus and 17.5 times more potent in suppressing responding in morphine-treated compared with untreated pigeons. In contrast, the acute dose of naltrexone required to prevent the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine was not changed by daily morphine injections. Acute injections of morphine attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of naltrexone. Mutual antagonism between morphine and naltrexone suggests that these drugs exert discriminative stimulus effects by opposing actions at the same receptors.\r"

Rats were trained to lever press for their daily food rations under fixed-ratio 30 schedules of reinforcement during four, daily, 0.5-hr sessions. In the first study, withdrawal from 10 days of PCP infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/hr resulted in markedly reduced response rates which typically occurred within 6 to 12 hr and recovered within 24 to 48 hr, providing evidence of dependence in the four rats tested. The PCP withdrawal effect was replicated systematically in seven additional rats which had been given individually maximally tolerated PCP infusion regimens. Additionally, when PCP was readministered during withdrawal, the downward trend in response rates was halted and rates increased rapidly to control levels, providing evidence of reversal of PCP withdrawal effects. When ketamine, another arylcyclohexylamine dissociative anesthetic, was administered during PCP withdrawal at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/hr, it also was able to reverse PCP withdrawal effects, demonstrating cross-dependence from PCP to ketamine. Response rates were also reduced markedly relative to control levels during withdrawal from continuous i.v. ketamine infusion in three rats tested, providing evidence that dependence upon this drug could also be induced. Withdrawal of PCP and ketamine administration can disrupt operant behavior, providing further evidence for the ability of these drugs to produce dependence.\r"

  ".W": "Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes the S-methylation of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and other thiopurine drugs. The level of TPMT activity in human tissue is controlled by a common genetic polymorphism. Our experiments were performed to study the relationship between TPMT phenotype and the effect of 6-MP on [3H]thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation into mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were isolated from blood samples obtained from 12 subjects, four each with each of the three classes of TPMT phenotype. The effect of 6-MP concentration on [3H]TdR incorporation was determined in the presence of two mitogens, phytohemagglutinin at concentrations of 1 and 10 micrograms/ml and concanavalin A at concentrations of 1 and 5 micrograms/ml. ED50 values for 6-MP inhibition of [3H]TdR incorporation into lymphocytes from subjects who genetically lacked TPMT activity were uniformly higher than were ED50 values for lymphocytes from subjects with intermediate or high enzyme activities. However, in the presence of either mitogen, ED50 values decreased as the level of stimulation increased. Therefore, to make it possible to account for degree of mitogen stimulation, the effect of 6-MP on [3H]TdR incorporation was studied in the presence of a series of phytohemagglutinin concentrations from 1 to 10 micrograms/ml. Lymphocytes from subjects who genetically lacked TPMT activity had significantly higher Ki values (1.37 +/- 0.340 microM, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 3) for inhibition of [3H]TdR incorporation by 6-MP than did lymphocytes from subjects with intermediate or high enzyme activities (0.529 +/- 0.068 and 0.327 +/- 0.064 microM, respectively, P less than .05 for both comparisons, n = 3 in both cases).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These diuretic agents were used to evaluate the functional integrity of discrete segments of the nephron in the neonatal rat following treatment with a known nephrotoxicant. Six-day old rats were treated s.c. with the proximal tubule toxicant mercuric chloride (1 or 3.2 mg/kg) or saline. Twenty-four hours later, when evidence of mercury nephrotoxicity is detectable, creatinine clearance and the fractional excretion of water and various components of the filtrate were determined using a 2-hr clearance period immediately after injection of a diuretic. The effects of mercury (3.2 mg/kg) were consistent with its ability to cause acute renal failure and proximal tubular necrosis and also indicated an apparent disruption of the cycling of urea in the nephron. A decrease in the fractional excretion of water, combined sodium and potassium and total osmotic solutes indicated that the diuretic response to acetazolamide was markedly attenuated in the mercuric chloride-treated pups whereas the responses to furosemide, chlorothiazide and amiloride were not altered by mercury treatment. Results from this study illustrate the specificity of these diuretics as pharmacologic probes of mercuric chloride induced renal dysfunction and, therefore, support their usefulness as tools in the investigation of renal developmental toxicity.\r"

  ".U": "87283302\r", 
  ".W": "2-Butoxyethanol (BE) is a massively produced glycol ether of which more than 230 million pounds was produced in the United States in 1983. It is extensively used in aerosols and cleaning agents intended for household use. This creates a high potential for human exposure during its manufacturing and use. A single exposure of rats to BE causes severe hemolytic anemia accompanied by secondary hemoglobinuria as well as liver and kidney damage. Butoxyacetic acid (BAA) was earlier identified as a urinary metabolite of BE. In addition, we have recently identified two additional urinary metabolites of BE, namely, BE-glucuronide and BE-sulfate conjugates. The current studies were undertaken to investigate the metabolic basis of BE-induced hematotoxicity in male F344 rats. Treatment of rats with pyrazole (alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor) protected rats against BE-induced hematotoxicity and inhibited BE metabolism to BAA. Pyrazole inhibition of BE metabolism to BAA was accompanied by increased BE metabolism to BE-glucuronide and BE-sulfate as determined by quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of BE metabolites in urine. There was approximately a 10-fold decrease in the ratio of BAA to BE-glucuronide + BE-sulfate in the urine of rats treated with pyrazole + BE compared to rats treated with BE alone. Pretreatment of rats with cyanamide (aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) also significantly protected rats against BE-induced hematotoxicity and modified BE metabolism in a manner similar to that caused by pyrazole. Administration of equimolar doses of BE, the metabolic intermediate butoxyacetaldehyde, or the ultimate metabolite BAA caused similar hematotoxic effects. Cyanamide also protected rats against butoxyacetaldehyde-induced hematotoxicity. Further evidence of the involvement of metabolism in hematotoxicity was demonstrated by the administration of deuterium-labeled BE (1,1-dideuterio-2-BE) which resulted in a significant delay in the development of hematotoxicity. It is therefore concluded that: a) there is a strong correlation between the amount of BAA in the urine and BE-induced hematotoxicity; b) metabolic activation of BE via alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases is a prerequisite for the development of BE-induced hematotoxicity; and c) hematotoxicity induced by BE can be attributed to its metabolite BAA. Finally, the current studies may prove beneficial in the treatment of acute glycol ethers poisoning with alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors.\r"

The normal ontogenetic pattern of binding indicated a small but detectable concentration of sites during late gestation, and a substantial increase after birth, primarily during the period in which the majority of cholinergic synapses is forming. The adult pattern of regional selectivity of binding capabilities, namely midbrain + brainstem greater than cerebral cortex much greater than cerebellum, was not present at birth, but rather developed over the ensuing 3 weeks postpartum. Fetal exposure to nicotine produced an elevation in binding detectable during the course of drug exposure (gestational day 18), a finding similar to nicotine's effects in mature brain. However, examination of the subsequent developmental pattern of [3H]nicotine binding indicated a generalized disruption of receptor acquisition, in that alterations persisted far beyond the period in which drug exposure was terminated. The greatest effect was seen in a region relatively poor in receptor sites (cerebellum), and a larger stimulation was obtained with injected vs. infused nicotine. Because the cerebellum is the primary target for disruption of cellular development by prenatal nicotine exposure, these results are consistent with a primary teratologic action of the drug rather than direct effects on development of [3H]nicotine receptors.\r"

The addition of carbachol induced a 20- to 30-fold increase in [3H]inositol monophosphate (IP1) accumulation within 30 min in the presence of 20 mM LiCl in granule cells prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol. Carbachol also stimulated the formation of [3H]inositol bisphosphate and [3H]inositol trisphosphate assayed either in the presence or in the absence of lithium; the increase in [3H]inositol triphosphate and [3H]inositol biphosphate synthesis appeared to be faster in the time course but much smaller in amount when compared with the formation of [3H]IP1. The EC50 of carbachol was approximately 7 microM, and the saturation concentration was about 100 microM. This carbachol-induced response was completely blocked by two muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, with a Ki of 0.5 and 120 nM, respectively. Saturation studies of the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to mAChRs in intact granule cells revealed the presence of a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 140 and 126 pM, respectively, and a Bmax of approximately 70 fmol/10(6) cells for both ligands. Within 1 hr after pre-exposure of cells to carbachol, the subsequent carbachol-induced [3H]IP1 accumulation was reduced by about 50%, whereas mAChR binding, assessed by using either [3H]N-methylscopolamine or [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, was unchanged. A second slower phase of desensitization was associated with a loss of mAChR binding sites; at 18 hr, the decrease of responsiveness was about 80%, whereas the loss of mAChR sites was about 60%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After bolus i.v. injection in rabbits with 2.5 kg. b.wt., the disappearance rate of all three forms from plasma could be described by a two-compartment disposition model with the following pharmacokinetic parameters: alpha T1/2, 3.2 to 3.9 min; beta T1/2, 15 to 16 min; volume of the central compartment, 170 to 200 ml; total volume of distribution, 660 to 910 ml; and plasma clearance, 18 to 22 ml/min. Similar results were obtained with cellular scu-PA in squirrel monkeys. Plasma euglobulin fibrinolytic activity disappeared in parallel with antigen, suggesting that the primary mechanism of disappearance is via clearance of the intact molecule. The organ distribution of isotope after bolus injection of 125I-labeled scu-PA revealed that clearance occurred via the liver and kidneys in rabbits, but predominantly via the liver in squirrel monkeys. Functional hepatectomy prolonged the alpha T1/2 of scu-PA in rabbits, whereas nephrectomy had no significant effect.

  ".W": "The present study investigated the influence of the extent of drug effect, duration of action and dose interval on the development of acute tolerance to the respiratory and cardiovascular depressant effects of opiates. Morphine (2, 4 and 10 mg/kg i.v.) caused a dose-related reduction in heart and respiratory rates and elevation in PaCO2 which lasted 4 to 4.5 hr. Acute tolerance occurred to the effect of a second dose of 4 or 10 mg/kg but not 2 mg/kg given 4 hr after the first. When the duration of action of the opiate was limited to 75 min by injection of naloxone (0.125 mg/kg) or by the use of a short acting opiate, fentanyl (0.025 mg/kg), tolerance to a second dose of drug still developed provided it was given at least 4 hr later. When naloxone was given at the peak of the morphine effect (30 min) tolerance did not occur. It is concluded that the development of acute tolerance to opiates depends on the degree of initial drug effect and the time of receptor occupancy. The latter must be longer than that required to attain a peak response. A time period of about 4 hr appears to be necessary for the full development of the biochemical processes involved in this phenomenon.\r"

The heterogeneity of the muscarinic receptors was examined both in vivo and in radioligand binding experiments. To study whether the receptors present in the investigated tissues are indeed distinct subtypes we determined the potencies of antagonists in both systems. It is proposed that there are three different binding sites present in hippocampal, atrial and submandibular membranes and we suggest to classify them as M1, M2 and M3, respectively. Both in vivo and in vitro pirenzepine appears to possess high affinity for M1 receptors, whereas 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide and dicyclomine show high affinity for both M1 and M3 receptors. AF-DX 116 (11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) displayed high affinity for M2 receptors.\r"

The inhibitory effect of CV-6209 on the PAF-induced rabbit platelet aggregation was 104, 9, 8 and 3 times more potent than the PAF antagonists CV-3988, ONO-6240, Ginkgolide B and etizolam, respectively. CV-6209 inhibited [3H]serotonin release from rabbit platelets stimulated with PAF (3 X 10(-8) M) with a similar potency as the inhibition on the platelet aggregation. CV-6209 inhibited PAF (0.3 microgram/kg i.v.)-induced hypotension in rats (ED50, 0.009 mg/kg i.v.) with no effect on the hypotension induced by arachidonic acid, histamine, bradykinin and isoproterenol. CV-6209 (1 mg/kg) inhibited slightly the acetylcholine-induced hypotension. In rats, post-treatment with CV-6209 reversed the PAF (1 microgram/kg i.v.)-induced hypotension rapidly (ED50, 0.0046 mg/kg i.v.); CV-6209 was 74, 20, 185 and over 2100 times more potent than CV-3988, ONO-6240, Ginkgolide B and etizolam, respectively. Thus, the relative potency of the anti-PAF action of PAF analog (CV-6209, CV-3988 and ONO-6240) differed little between the inhibition of PAF-induced platelet aggregation and the reversal of PAF-induced hypotension, but that of nonPAF analogs (Ginkgolide B and etizolam) differed greatly with these assay systems, when standardized with CV-6209.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 711389-S, a new antiarrhythmic drug, on the sodium channel of crayfish giant axon were studied using micro-electrode and sucrose-gap voltage-clamp techniques. When applied externally, 711389-S suppressed the action potential and the rate of rise without affecting the resting membrane potential. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that 711389-S inhibits the sodium current more selectively than the potassium current and that the inhibition is more evident with internal rather than external application. The inhibitory effect of internally applied 711389-S on sodium current was enhanced at less negative holding potentials. 711389-S also shifted the steady-state inactivation curve in the direction of hyperpolarization. Use-dependent block became evident in the 711389-S-treated axons; this block resulted from an increase in the slow inactivating state during repetitive depolarization and from a slow recovery from the inactivated state during the pulse interval. 711389-S produced an additional inhibition when sodium channels were open at large depolarizations. This additional inhibition could be reversed by small depolarizations that opened the sodium channels. These observations suggest that 711389-S binds the resting, inactivated and open states of the sodium channel, resulting in a reduction of sodium channel availability. 711389-S also shifted the voltage dependence of peak sodium conductance toward a less negative potential.\r"

This inhibition of GGT by acivicin resulted in a 10- to 12-fold increase in the biliary excretion of reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione. Because the biliary excretion of cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly), Cys-Gly disulfide, cysteine (Cys) and cystine concomitantly decreased (63-99%), the biliary excretion rate of total glutathione-derived thiols and disulfides did not change. In contrast, acivicin treatment dramatically elevated the urinary excretion rate of glutathione-derived thiols in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a 390-fold increase at the highest dosage. This mainly originated from enhancement of urinary excretion of GSH (up to 7200-fold), although the excretion of Cys and Cys-Gly into urine was also increased. Acivicin treatment did not affect hepatic and renal levels of GSH but, at high dosages, reduced the concentration of Cys in these organs. GSH and oxidized glutathione concentrations in serum were increased, whereas cystine was diminished in acivicin-treated rats. Inhibition of GGT by acivicin (100 mumol/kg i.v.) failed to influence the biliary excretion of methylmercury but increased urinary excretion 34-fold. Even though the urinary thiol excretion was much higher than the biliary thiol excretion in the acivicin-treated rats, methylmercury was preferentially excreted into bile rather than urine, indicating the importance of the liver as an excretory organ for methylmercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "S-(N-Methylcarbamoyl)glutathione has been identified by cesium ion liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry as a biliary metabolite in mice of the experimental antitumor agent and hepatotoxin N-methylformamide. Metabolism of N-methylformamide to urinary methylamine, urinary N-acetyl-S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)-cysteine and biliary S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)glutathione was found to be subject to large intermolecular primary kinetic isotope effects when hydrogen was replaced by deuterium in the formyl group (kH/kD = 5.5 +/- 0.2, 4.5 +/- 1.0 and 7 +/- 2, respectively), as shown by mass spectrometry of derivatives of these metabolites. These values indicate the existence of a common metabolic precursor for each of these metabolites. In particular, methylamine is shown not to arise from simple enzymatic hydrolysis of N-methylformamide but is associated with an oxidative process. Therefore, it is highly likely that N-methylformamide is oxidized and conjugated to form S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)glutathione which is metabolized further to N-acetyl-S-(N-methylcarbamoyl) cysteine. Either of these thiocarbamates could be hydrolyzed to give the parent thiol and the observed metabolic end products, methylamine and carbon dioxide. The presence of deuterium in the formyl moiety of N-methylformamide reduced markedly the hepatotoxicity of the compound, as shown by measurements of the activities of appropriate hepatic enzymes in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that the prolongation of the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) by amiodarone might be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of thyroid influence on the heart. VERP values were measured in vitro in isolated septal preparations obtained from control, thyroidectomized and thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine; T4)- or triiodothyronine (T3)-treated rats. Differences in thyroid influence on the heart between these groups were assessed by changes in the myosin isozyme (V1, V2, V3) pattern. VERP measurements were also done in similar groups treated with amiodarone for 7 days (50 mg/kg/day i.p.). VERP tended to be increased by thyroidectomy and was significantly reduced by T4 or T3 treatment when compared with the control group. Amiodarone treatment significantly prolonged VERP in control (33.4 +/- 1.9 to 45.0 +/- 4.5 msec), thyroidectomized (39.9 +/- 1.7 to 48.3 +/- 2.8 msec), T4-treated (26.2 +/- 1.0 to 37.4 +/- 1.3 msec) and T3-treated rats (25.6 +/- 1.1 to 34.3 +/- 1.3 msec). However, the magnitudes of the VERP prolongation by amiodarone were not significantly different among the four groups. The action of amiodarone on action potential duration was similar to its action on VERP. The myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone were not significantly different among the four groups. Amiodarone treatment produced a significant reduction of serum T3 levels in the control and in the T4-treated groups and an increase in reverse T3 levels. Thus, the class III action of amiodarone was not affected, in the present model, by experimental modification of thyroid influence on the heart.\r"

Specific [3H]prazosin binding in hypertrophied prostates of humans was saturable and of high affinity (Kd = 0.6 nM) with a maximal number of binding sites of 106 fmol/mg of protein, and it showed a pharmacological specificity as well as stereo-selectivity which characterized alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Adrenergic antagonists competed for the binding in order: R-(-)-YM-12617(5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]propyl]-2- methoxybenzenesulfonamide HCl) greater than (+/-)-YM-12617 = prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than S-(+)-YM-12617 greater than idazoxan. R-(-)- and (+/-)-YM-12617, alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists, have been shown to exhibit an extremely high affinity for prostatic [3H]prazosin binding sites (Ki = 0.6 and 1.1 nM, respectively). In addition, R-(-)-YM-12617 was approximately 100 times as potent as the S-(+)-isomer. The affinities of prazosin and YM-12617 compounds for [3H]prazosin binding sites in hypertrophied prostates of humans correlated closely with their pharmacological potencies in prostates reported previously. The blockade of [3H]prazosin binding sites in hypertrophied prostates of humans induced by (+/-)-YM-12617 was easily reversed by washing. There was a significant 35% increase in the maximal number of binding sites for [3H] prazosin binding in hypertrophied prostates from benign prostatic hypertrophy compared to normal tissues, whereas the hypertrophy had little effect on the Kd value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study shows that this effect is stereospecific; MR-2034 markedly increased urinary output over the dose range 0.08 to 1.25 mg/kg, whereas the opposite isomer, MR-2035, was markedly less potent. Bremazocine increased urinary output in Long-Evans hooded and Sprague-Dawley albino rats as well as lean and fatty Zucker rats. In the lean Zucker and the albino rats, bremazocine produced an inverted U-shaped diuretic dose-effect curve, an effect characteristic of kappa agonists with mu agonist activity. This pattern was not seen with the fatty Zucker rats or the Long-Evans hooded rats. The full kappa agonists bremazocine, ethylketazocine and U-50,488 increased urinary output under three different conditions of hydration: water loaded, normal hydration and water deprived. In contrast, the partial kappa agonists reliably only increase urinary output under the normal hydration condition. The diuretic effects of full and partial kappa agonists correlated with plasma vasopressin levels in water-deprived rats. The full kappa agonists (ethylketazocine, U-50,488, tifluadom and MR-2034) suppressed plasma vasopressin levels below the threshold of detectability of the radioimmunoassay, whereas the partial kappa agonists (nalorphine and butorphanol) suppressed vasopressin levels compared with control values but did not have the efficacy of the full kappa agonists. All these results support the hypothesis that kappa agonists produce their diuretic effect by suppression of plasma vasopressin levels.\r"

Hypophysectomy reduced the conjugating activity in both male and female rats (by 57% in the male and 42% in the female). Thyroidectomy also decreased the rate of conjugation in both sexes and adrenalectomy was without effect. Castration of the male animals caused a significant reduction in activity (of 32%) but ovariectomy resulted in a marked increase in conjugation (of 60%). The effect of hypophysectomy in the male can therefore be explained in terms of the hypophyseal control of the thyroid gland and testes but the effect of pituitary ablation in the female is more difficult to explain in terms of interference with peripheral endocrine organs as hypophysectomy and ovariectomy have such opposite effects. The effect of ovariectomy is seen to be reversed by estradiol benzoate treatment and testosterone has a small effect in the castrated but not the hypophysectomized male animals. This indicates that estrogens and androgens are important regulators of 1-naphthol conjugation and that androgens probably act via the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and not directly on the liver. This is substantiated further by the partial reversal of the effect of hypophysectomy by a renal pituitary implant or growth hormone. The conjugate formed from 1-naphthol is seen to be all glucuronide and this is unaffected by the sex of the animal or by hypophysectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 administration induced a rise in the circulating aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase after BB administration significantly greater than in unsupplemented rats. The volumic density of necrosis was not, however, increased by 1,25(OH)2D3 whereas the proportion of acidophilic cells surrounding the necrotic area and the ratio of acidophilic to necrotic cells were significantly increased suggesting the presence of regenerating parenchyma. Oral calcium yielded an increase comparable to that of 1,25(OH)2D3 in apparent BB toxicity which was accompanied by a significant rise in both the volumic density of necrosis and of acidophilic cells but the ratio of acidophilic to necrotic cells was not increased by dietary calcium. The amount of cytochrome P-450 lost after BB administration, the covalent binding of BB metabolites to cellular proteins in vitro and the total liver glutathione content were not changed by either 1,25(OH)2D3 or calcium supplementation. Results show that hypocalcemic vitamin D-depleted rats are protected partially against BB toxicity; this protection does not seem to be due to a decrease in the hepatic metabolism of BB but seems to be related to the hypocalcemic state; on the other hand, the active regenerating process which seemed more apparent in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated than in all other animals may have contributed to offset partly the cellular damage induced by the toxin in the hormone-treated group.\r"

Prior treatment of SHRs with i.v. naloxone (2 or 4 mg/kg) or i.c.v. yohimbine (10 or 20 micrograms/kg) reduced the hypotension and bradycardia induced by i.c.v. clonidine, but in Wistar-Kyoto rats naloxone had no similar blocking effects. Prazosin (20 micrograms/kg i.c.v.) reduced the clonidine bradycardia but not the hypotension in SHRs. Hypotension in the SHRs due to i.c.v. alpha-methylnorepinephrine (20 micrograms/kg) was reduced by both naloxone and yohimbine whereas alpha-methylnorepinephrine bradycardia was reduced by yohimbine but not by naloxone. Prior hypothalamic lesions in the SHRs reduced clonidine hypotension, but not bradycardia, and interfered with naloxone blockade of the residual clonidine hypotensive effect. Clonidine lowered immunoreactive BE levels in SHR hypothalamus, medulla and pituitary but did not change BE levels in the i.c.v. perfusate. The findings support the idea that in the SHRs, clonidine hypotension results from alpha-2 adrenergic stimulation of brain, causing BE release and central opiate receptor activation, and they suggest that the hypothalamus is involved in these interactions. Also, clonidine hypotension and bradycardia appear to involve different mechanisms in brain.\r"

  ".W": "The repeated daily administration of moderate doses of amphetamine results in an augmentation of the behavioral response to subsequent amphetamine challenge. One feature of the augmentation is a shift in the type of perseverative behaviors to those generally associated with higher acute doses of the drug. Consistent with these observations, rats pretreated with six daily injections of amphetamine (3 mg/kg) exhibited primarily oral stereotypies to a challenge dose of 2.5 mg/kg of amphetamine, whereas control animals exhibited focused sniffing and repetitive head movements. Previously we found that the acute administration of amphetamine or methylphenidate only at doses which induce oral stereotypies promotes a rapid desensitization of striatal dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. We therefore examined the effects of repeated amphetamine pretreatment on this index of D1 dopamine receptors. The administration of 2.5 mg/kg of amphetamine produced a 2-fold shift to the right in the concentration-response curve for dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in animals pretreated with amphetamine, but not in saline pretreated controls. No effect of the chronic amphetamine pretreatment on dopamine stimulated cyclase in the absence of amphetamine challenge was observed. The binding of [3H]cis-flupenthixol to striatal D1 dopamine receptors was not affected by acute or chronic amphetamine. These results suggest a relationship between stimulant-induced desensitization of striatal D1 dopamine receptors and the induction of oral stereotypies.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ryanodine, a neutral alkaloid, on the Ca++ uptake and Ca++ release properties of a skeletal muscle isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) preparation were evaluated. Ryanodine had no effect on the rate of oxalate-facilitated Ca++ uptake in this SR. Ruthenium red, which reportedly blocks Ca++ channels, increased Ca++ uptake by 2-fold in the SR. Although no effect of ryanodine on Ca++ transport by SR was observed, notable effects on Ca++-induced Ca++ release pathways were discovered. Ryanodine acts on the same Ca++ channels that are affected by ruthenium red. When these Ca++ channels were activated by Ca++ to an open state in the presence of ryanodine, then ryanodine maintained the channel in an activated, open state. However, once Ca++ was taken up by the SR, ryanodine tended to lock the channel in a closed state, producing a condition refractory to Ca++-induced Ca++ release. Thus, dual, opposing effects of ryanodine were demonstrated. In a fast-reaction kinetics measurement of Ca++-induced Ca++ release, both rate and amount of Ca++ release were reduced by ryanodine, and Ca++ appeared to act in a noncompetitive, antagonistic mode. These unusual, antithetical effects of ryanodine on the Ca++ efflux pathway are not mechanistically defined by this study, but they reveal the potential value of ryanodine as a probe for exploring Ca++ channel function.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous infusion of leukotriene D4 (LTD4; 0.1-10 micrograms/kg) produced dose-related depression of myocardial contractility, stroke volume index and mean aortic blood flow index in anesthetized monkeys. These alterations occurred in association with increments in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, reductions in calculated left ventricular stroke and minute work indices and relatively little or no dose-dependent change in cardiac rate, mean arterial blood pressure and mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Left atrial pressure did not increase in response to LTD4, although cardiac afterload was increased and myocardial contractility and stroke volume index were reduced. LTD4-induced alterations of aortic blood flow index, stroke volume index and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were sustained during a 60-min observation period after drug infusion. Pretreatment of monkeys with LY171883 (10 mg/kg i.v.), a selective LTD4-LTE4 receptor antagonist, inhibited the magnitude and duration of hemodynamic responses to LTD4 challenge. For example, LTD4 dose-response curves for depression of mean aortic blood flow index, stroke volume index and left ventricular stroke and minute work indices were shifted to the right approximately 10-fold by LY171883. The plasma concentration of LY171883 effective in this regard was 32 +/- 7 micrograms/ml. Attenuation of LTD4 responses by LY171883 was selective in that antagonist pretreatment did not result in concomitant reduction of vascular and cardiac responses mediated by adrenergic receptors, and LY171883 administration produced little or no change in base-line parameters. The composite data provide evidence of the presence of LT receptors in the primate cardiovascular system and suggest that LY171883 is a selective antagonist of these receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the treatment of concurrent CO/CN intoxication has been paid scant attention. The suggestion has been made that these victims should be treated for CN poisoning. The current therapeutic management of CN poisoning in this country includes the utilization of two methemoglobin formers: amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite. This study was undertaken to determine if the administration of methemoglobin formers is advisable, as the victim is already suffering from O2 deprivation due to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin. Groups of 28 male ICR mice (22-24 g) were injected i.p. with 5.0 mg/kg of KCN and then were exposed immediately to 0.35% CO for 8.5 min in a dynamic inhalation chamber. Half of the animals were marked randomly for antidotal intervention, the other 14 animals acted as controls. Treatment of survivors with amyl nitrite (12 mg/l of chamber air) for 1 min increased mortality 43%, whereas treatment for 2 min resulted in a 59% increase in mortality. A 25% increase in mortality was noted among those animals treated with sodium nitrite (80 mg/kg i.p.), as compared to the nontreated control survivors. Treatment with dimethylaminophenol (49 mg/kg i.p.) did not statistically affect mortality.\r"

McN-5707 blocked tetrabenazine-induced sedation and ptosis in mice and rats, and potently inhibited the uptake of norepinephrine by synaptosomes from rat hypothalamus (Ki approximately 2 nM), and the uptake of serotonin by synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex (Ki approximately 10 nM). McN-5707 also inhibited the uptake of dopamine by synaptosomes from rat striatum (Ki approximately 40 nM); however, the stereotypic behavior often caused by dopamine uptake inhibitors was not evident in rats at doses of 300 mg/kg (p.o.) or less. In receptor binding assays, McN-5707 potently inhibited ketanserin binding to serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in synaptic membranes from rat cerebral cortex (apparent Ki approximately 8 nM). In mice, McN-5707 antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches. Spiperone binding to dopamine D2 receptors in synaptic membranes from rat striatum was weakly inhibited by McN-5707 (apparent Ki approximately 400 nM), as was the binding of WB4101 to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (apparent Ki approximately 150 nM). McN-5707 was essentially inactive as an inhibitor of [3H]clonidine binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic receptors. In experiments with guinea pig ileum, McN-5707 weakly antagonized histamine-induced contractions and exhibited virtually no cholinergic or anticholinergic activity. Our observations indicate McN-5707 possesses attributes of both tricyclic and newer atypical antidepressants because it inhibits the uptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, and blocks 5-HT2 receptors, but lacks some of the anticholinergic and behavioral properties often associated with them.\r"

Treatment with CGS-16617 (1 microgram/kg) or CGS-13080 (200 micrograms/kg) alone did not alter significantly postoligemic hypotension or the increase in plasma cathepsin D activity in shocked rats, compared with hemorrhaged rats receiving only their vehicle. Combined treatment with both drugs maintained postreinfusion mean arterial blood pressure and attenuated the increase in plasma cathepsin D activity in hemorrhaged rats. Treatment of shocked rats with each drug alone attenuated the accumulation of a myocardial depressant factor activity in the plasma, but the lowest myocardial depressant factor activities were observed in rats treated with the drug combination. Additionally, animals treated with the drug combination exhibited significantly longer postreinfusion survival times than rats receiving either the vehicle (P less than .01), CGS-16617 (P less than .05) or CGS-13080 (P less than .02). CGS-16617 (1 microgram/kg) attenuated significantly the pressor response to angiotensin I throughout the shock period. CGS-13080 attenuated the increase in TxB2 plasma concentrations in shock when compared with hemorrhaged rats receiving the vehicle (P less than .05). Greater attenuation of TxB2 was found after treatment with the drug combination (P less than .01 from vehicle, P less than .05 from CGS-13080 alone). CGS-16617, but not CGS-13080, was also found to have a direct antiproteolytic action in pancreatic homogenates. However, the drug combination (CGS-16617 and CGS-13080) decreased proteolytic activity even further (P less than .001) from CGS-16617 alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inasmuch as many of the clinical conditions for which diuretics are used are associated with growth retardation, we investigated the influence of diuretic therapy on growth in an animal model. In Part I, 32 weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet adequate for growth which contained 0.08% sodium and 0.17% potassium. Daily i.p. injections of saline (0.4 ml) containing furosemide in doses of 0, 50, 100 or 200 mg/M2 were given for 9 days. There was a dose-related reduction in weight gain which could not be explained by lower food intake. The highest dose group gained only 58% as much as the control group. Balance studies and muscle, bone and carcass analysis demonstrated that this was accounted for by decreases in protoplasmic, bone, fat and extracellular fluid volume accretion. In Part II, 32 weanling rats, all treated daily with furosemide (100 mg/M2 i.p.) received replacement of NaCl, KCl, both or neither in their drinking water. Sodium replacement resulted in increased growth rates whereas potassium replacement alone had no effect on growth. Sodium replacement also increased the balance of all measured minerals. We conclude that diuretic therapy causes growth retardation by preventing retention of sodium needed for growth.\r"

  ".W": "The relative importance of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways to the antinociceptive action of supraspinally and systemically administered morphine sulfate, and to the antinociceptive synergism observed between spinally and supraspinally administered morphine was examined in mice. Morphine administered i.c.v., intrathecally (i.t.), s.c. or i.t. + i.c.v. produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive response, as measured by the tail-flick test. The dose-response curve for morphine (i.c.v.) was shifted significantly to the right by equal i.t. doses of methysergide or phentolamine. However, the most pronounced shift to the right was caused by i.t. administration of the selective alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine. Administration of a subantinociceptive dose of morphine (i.t.) along with morphine (i.c.v.) shifted the dose-response curve for morphine (i.c.v.) 6-fold to the left. The resulting dose-response curve for morphine (i.c.v.) was shifted to the right more by phentolamine (i.t.) than by methysergide (i.t.). Similarly, the dose-response curve for morphine (s.c.) was shifted more to the right by phentolamine (i.t.) than by methysergide (i.t.). These results suggest that the descending noradrenergic system, more than the serotonergic system, may be an important component in spinal/supraspinal interactive mechanisms that may mediate the antinociceptive action of systemically administered morphine.\r"

The data were obtained from previously reported pharmacokinetic studies in mammals (i.e., humans, monkey, dog, rat and mouse) and new pharmacokinetic data for the pigeon. The animal body weights ranged from 32.5 to 77,000 g and included 6 animal species from 2 vertebrate classes. The pharmacokinetic parameters correlated with body weight were T1/2 (T1/2 = 126B0.32, r2 = 0.799), volume of distribution (V beta = 10B0.96, r2 = 0.966) and systemic clearance (CLs = 50B0.64, r2 = 0.891). In addition, clearance values were multiplied by the maximum lifespan potential (MLP) of each animal and correlated with body weight [CLs X MLP = (3.3 X 10(5))B1.0, r2 = 0.991]. This helped normalize for species differences in systemic clearance, which correlated with species longevity. These allometric equations should provide the information for scaling phencyclidine pharmacokinetic data among diverse species.\r"

Lung glycogen was depleted 56% in the ritodrine-infused twins and glycogen phosphorylase a activity was increased 1.8-fold whereas glycogen synthase activity remained unchanged. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity increased 1.7-fold, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (phosphorylase kinase) activity increased 1.4-fold and calcium-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) activity increased 1.6-fold. In addition, the maximal binding capacity of pulmonary beta receptors decreased 49% in the ritodrine-infused twins. However, lung cyclic AMP content was unchanged after 24 hr of ritodrine infusion.

Ritodrine infusion was associated with statistically significant metabolic and pulmonary effects in comparison with twin controls. Fetal serum glucose levels were elevated 1.7-fold, arterial blood pH fell 0.04 U and arterial blood pO2 fell 5.1 torr in the ritodrine-infused twins. Tracheal fluid flow was reduced 6.9-fold and surface active material flux into the tracheal fluid was thereby virtually eliminated. But the surface active material content of tracheal fluid and lung lavage increased 3.0-fold. The surfactant phospholipid content of lung lavage also increased 3.0-fold with no change in its composition. There was a concomitant improvement in pulmonary mechanics on pressure-volume curves: the lungs of the ritodrine-infused twins filled with 1.7-fold more air on inflation to 40 cm of water pressure and also retained 1.7-fold more air on deflation to 10 cm of water pressure. We conclude that beta-2 agonist inhibits tracheal fluid flow, increases surfactant in lung lavage and improves lung stability in the fetal lamb lung. We speculate that preferential beta-2 adrenergic stimulation of the fetal lung with ritodrine could be helpful in the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome because of enhanced surfactant availability in airways and improved pulmonary mechanics.\r"

Liquid deliveries were contingent upon lip-contact responses on solenoid-operated drinking spouts. PCP deliveries exceeded water deliveries throughout the experiment, indicating that the drug was functioning as a positive reinforcer. The monkeys were also trained to lever press under a fixed-ratio 64 or fixed-ratio 80 schedule of food delivery. Food was available during three 1 hr periods each day, with 6.5 hr of liquid availability between each food component. After behavior stabilized for at least 10 days under these conditions, water was substituted for PCP for 2, 4, 8 or 24 days. Food-maintained responding was severely disrupted for the first 2 days of water substitution, with a steady recovery over the following 6 days. The monkeys were noticeably irritable during water substitution, but there were no other physical signs of PCP withdrawal. Disruptions in food-maintained responding were immediately reversed when PCP was reinstated. Subsequently, the PCP concentration was varied (0.062, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml), and PCP intake (milligrams per kilogram), as well as the magnitude of disruptions in pellet deliveries (upon termination of PCP access), also varied directly with PCP intake. The amount of PCP intake was also altered by limiting PCP (0.25 mg/ml) access to every 2nd or 4th day, with water available on intervening days. Pellet deliveries were substantially disrupted during water substitution, and food-maintained responding immediately returned to control levels when PCP became available.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lastly, the kappa agonists were examined in monkeys trained to respond differentially in the presence or absence of ethylketazocine. For comparison, morphine and another kappa agonist, Mr 2033, were examined under some of the procedures. Kappa agonists produced dose-dependent increases in urine output whereas morphine did not. Morphine, as well as each of the kappa agonists examined, produced dose-dependent increases in tail-withdrawal latencies from both 50 and 55 degrees C water; analgesic doses of kappa agonists produced marked stupor and muscle relaxation. Kappa agonists produced ethylketazocine-appropriate responding in the drug discrimination procedure. Doses of kappa agonists that produced ethylketazocine-appropriate responding were similar to doses that increased urine output and smaller than doses that increased tail-withdrawal latencies.

The nonspecific inhibition of gastric acid by ORF 17583 supports the existence of interdependence between histamine and the gastrin and cholinergic receptors on the parietal cell surface. Antisecretory potency of ORF 17583 after intraduodenal administration in pylorus-ligated rats was 6.4 times greater than cimetidine, 1.8 times greater than ranitidine, equal to that of omeprazole and 8 times less than that of famotidine. Oral antisecretory potency of ORF 17583 in gastric fistula dogs was 31 times greater than cimetidine, 3.7 times greater than ranitidine and equal to that of omeprazole and famotidine. Studies using equieffective antisecretory doses of ORF 17583 and ranitidine in dogs suggested that ORF 17583 has a short duration of antisecretory activity similar to that of ranitidine.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of intestinal uptake of alpha-methyldopa (Aldomet) was investigated using isolated segments of rat small intestine. Incubations were limited to 2 to 5 min as histological examination of the tissue showed significant loss of structural integrity after 10 to 20 min at 37 degrees C. alpha-Methyldopa in the tissue was extracted and assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Corrections were applied for uptake into extracellular spaces using inulin (14C). Uptake was temperature- and concentration-dependent (Km congruent to 10 mM), was dependent on the location in the small intestine and was inhibited by ouabain (2 mM) or lack of sodium or glucose in the incubation medium. alpha-Methyldopa uptake also was inhibited by other neutral amino acids. The mucosal cell layer accounted for approximately 50% of the total drug accumulated in the tissue. Uptake was less when the serosal surface was exposed than when the tissue was everted. The similarity in uptake parameters between alpha-methyldopa and L-phenylalanine (parallel experiments) suggests that alpha-methyldopa is principally absorbed into rat small intestinal mucosal cells via an amino acid transport system.\r"

  ".W": "The alpha and beta adrenoceptor-mediated effects of the novel, orally active inotropic prodrug, ibopamine, have been studied in the pithed rat and compared with those effects mediated by dopamine and the active form of ibopamine, epinine. All three agents produced alpha adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses in pithed rats, and the vasopressor effects of ibopamine and epinine, but not dopamine, were potentiated by beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (3 mg/kg i.v.). Catecholamine depletion with reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect the vasoconstrictor response elicited by any of these agents, indicating a direct effect in the vasculature. Epinine was 10 times more potent than ibopamine or dopamine. The pressor response to all three agents was antagonized by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) and the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), suggesting the involvement of both alpha adrenoceptor subtypes in the vasopressor responses elicited by these compounds. After complete blockade of alpha adrenoceptors using a combination of phenoxybenzamine (3 mg/kg i.v.), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) and rauwolscine (1 mg/kg i.v.), higher doses of ibopamine, epinine and dopamine produced a propranolol-sensitive, beta-1 adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic response that was significantly reduced in reserpine-pretreated rats, indicating a significant indirect component in the activity of these compounds at the level of the myocardium. Epinine and dopamine were equipotent and were 10 times more potent than ibopamine as directly acting beta-1 adrenoceptor agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The muscarinic actions of several analogs of oxotremorine were compared in the mouse. Compounds such as AKS 19 and BM 5 having low intrinsic efficacy (partial agonists) differentiated between centrally mediated muscarinic effects as they, like oxotremorine, were potent in producing analgesia and hypothermia but did not produce tremor. Instead they antagonized oxotremorine-induced tremor. They resembled oxotremorine in their ability to stimulate salivary secretion. Excellent correlations were found between the various muscarinic effects measured in vivo and spasmogenic activity on the guinea pig ileum and between tremorolytic potency and affinity for ileal muscarinic receptors. The results suggest that there are regional differences in the receptor reserve for muscarinic agonists that may affect in vivo responses to partial agonists in a qualitative manner. Responses to more efficacious agonists such as oxotremorine are affected only quantitatively by such differences. Efficacious agonists appeared to have a large receptor reserve with respect to salivation, analgesia and hypothermia, whereas their receptor reserve for the tremor response was lower. The possibility is raised of achieving selective muscarinic actions, even in the absence of distinct subtypes of muscarinic receptors, by exploiting regional differences in receptor density, in the efficiency of receptor-effector coupling and in endogenous levels of acetylcholine.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have recently found that the hepatic, microsomal ATP-dependent Ca++ pump activity is decreased through oxidation by cytochrome P-450-generated reactive oxygen species. This inhibition is reversed by reduced glutathione and only partially reversed by reactive oxygen scavengers. In view of these observations, the authors have sought to determine whether norepinephrine could regulate the Ca++ pump by differential modulation of the oxidative and reductive pathways. They find that, in the presence of superoxide dismutase (15 micrograms/ml), catalase (65 micrograms/ml), reduced glutathione (5 mM) and NADP+ (0.39 mM), the pump activity was maximal 142% of no norepinephrine at 10(-11) to 10(-10) M norepinephrine and decreased with increasing concentrations of norepinephrine. NADPH had no effect on uptake at 10(-11) M norepinephrine, but, between 10(-10) and 10(-8) M norepinephrine, it significantly decreased uptake compared with NADP+. At 10(-7) to 10(-6) M norepinephrine, with either NADP+ or NADPH, the uptake was significantly lower than at other norepinephrine concentrations. This decrease in the uptake seen at 10(-7) to 10(-6) M norepinephrine disappeared on the addition of 0.25 microM l-(S)-propranolol. The NADPH inhibition of the pump was blocked by imidazole-histidine buffer but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial metabolism. ATP and norepinephrine had little effect on mitochondrial uptake. These studies suggest that norepinephrine may modulate the hepatic, microsomal ATP-dependent Ca++ pump through alterations in the balance between oxidative and reductive pathways.\r"

In normoxic isolated perfused hearts (n = 20) instrumented for measurement of atrioventricular conduction time and left ventricular pressure, BW A1433U (0.1 microM) or BW A533U (5 microM) attenuated AH interval prolongation induced by adenosine (5 microM) by 90%, but neither xanthine derivative attenuated the AH interval prolongation induced by acetylcholine (0.11 microM), digoxin (0.91 microM) or D600 (1.3 microM). In four additional hearts, BW A1433U at concentrations of up to 10 microM had no effect on left ventricular pressure or AH interval. BW A1433 or BW A533U (50 microM) inhibited myocardial cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase by only 11.5 +/- 1.6 and 26.6 +/- 2.6%, respectively. Schild analysis of adenosine concentration-response curves obtained in the absence and presence of BW A533U and BW A1433U (n = 14) yielded pA2 values of (mean +/- S.E.M.) 6.32 +/- 0.10 and 7.70 +/- 0.08, respectively. pKd values for BW A533U and BW A1433U binding to adenosine receptors on ventricular membranes were 6.36 and 6.94, respectively.

  ".W": "Naphthalene, a selective pulmonary bronchiolar cytotoxicant in the mouse, is metabolized in the liver to reactive metabolites that are capable of circulating and becoming bound irreversibly in extrahepatic tissues in vivo. Circulating reactive metabolites generated in the liver could interact with extrahepatic tissues either directly to produce toxicity or indirectly by depleting cellular defense capabilities. The studies reported here were to determine whether naphthalene oxide, an obligate and unstable intermediate in the metabolism of naphthalene, is capable of diffusing from intact hepatocytes. Efflux was measured by trapping the epoxide with [3H]glutathione followed by subsequent quantitation of the labeled glutathione adducts. Seventeen to 35% of the total amount of naphthalene oxide formed intracellularly was trapped extracellularly in 15- and 30-min incubations. The quantity of naphthalene oxide effluxing from isolated hepatocytes increased with increasing substrate concentrations. However, the relative amount of epoxide leaving the cell as a percentage of the total formed did not change over naphthalene concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 1.5 mM. Reactive naphthalene metabolites capable of binding covalently to extracellular proteins diffused from isolated hepatocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The ratio of extracellular to intracellular covalent binding was dependent upon the concentration of naphthalene in the incubation; at low naphthalene concentrations, covalent binding was higher extracellularly than intracellularly, whereas, at high concentrations, metabolites were predominantly bound intracellularly. These studies suggest that there is no threshold for the efflux of naphthalene oxide but that the relative amounts of reactive metabolite bound intra- vs. extra-cellularly may depend upon saturation of intracellular detoxication capabilities.\r"

The functional consequences were studied of exposing the dog tibial artery for 2 hr to 5-hydroxytryptamine (10(-6) M) in vitro. During the exposure, unmetabolized 5-hydroxytryptamine was accumulated by the cocaine-sensitive amine uptake mechanism of tibial artery adrenergic nerves. After exposure to [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine, transmural electrical stimulation caused the release of the tritiated indoleamine which was blocked by tetrodotoxin. After a 1-hr washout of rings of tibial artery exposed previously to 5-hydroxytryptamine, contractions in response to transmural electrical stimulation were depressed, whereas the response to exogenously added norepinephrine was unaffected. That the decreased response to electrical stimulation after exposure to 5-hydroxytryptamine was due to decreased release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves was demonstrated in strips of the artery preincubated in [3H]norepinephrine. The inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine release after exposure to 5-hydroxytryptamine, was blocked by the serotonergic antagonist, methiothepin, but not by the alpha adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, suggesting that serotonergic receptors mediate the inhibition. The inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine release also was prevented by blocking adrenergic neuronal uptake with cocaine before exposure to 5-hydroxytryptamine. These results suggest that 5-hydroxytryptamine is accumulated and released by tibial artery adrenergic nerves as a cotransmitter. In so doing, the indoleamine inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission in the tibial artery by its action at prejunctional serotonergic receptors.\r"

However, because of its ability also to cause transmitter release, it is difficult to examine the properties of cocaine as an uptake blocker using in vitro techniques such as tissue slices or synaptosomes. Thus, we have evaluated cocaine as a blocker of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake processes by determining the in vivo effect of concurrent administrations of cocaine on the neurochemical effects of methamphetamine treatments. These findings demonstrated that cocaine like 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake blockers such as citalopram, greatly attenuated or blocked decreases in striatal and cortical tryptophan hydroxylase activities and concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid induced by multiple and single methamphetamine administrations. In contrast to other dopamine uptake blockers, such as amfonelic acid, cocaine did not attenuate the methamphetamine effects on striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and the concentrations of dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid. The neurochemical findings were correlated with behavioral analyses.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of various structural analogs of tetrahydrobiopterin to enter the rat brain and remain in the reduced form after i.p. administration was tested because tetrahydrobiopterin itself enters poorly. The total content of various pterins in different brain areas was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection, whereas high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection was used to measure the content of reduced pterins. The effect of injection of certain tetrahydropterins on brain content of biogenic amines and their major metabolites was also monitored. In general, when the position 6 side-chain of tetrahydrobiopterin was made shorter and smaller in size, entrance into the brain from the periphery was markedly enhanced. Increasing the lipophilicity or size of the position 6 side-chain did not allow for better entry into brain and, in some cases, hindered entry. Under the conditions tested, none of the tetrahydropterins influenced the brain content of biogenic amines or their major metabolites; higher brain concentrations of tetrahydropterins are probably necessary to modify central nervous system biogenic amine metabolism. Other types of structural modifications or experimental approaches may be necessary to achieve higher brain concentrations of active cofactors, which may be required for the successful treatment of certain human diseases with tetrahydropterins.\r"

EC50 values for responses to KCl in aortae equilibrated in Tris and N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid were slightly less than those in bicarbonate; maximum contractions did not differ. There were no significant differences in contractile responses to prostaglandin Fa alpha or histamine in the three buffered solutions. In aortae precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, both acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore, A23187, elicited much less relaxation in artificial buffered solutions than in bicarbonate-buffered solutions. Maximum relaxations to nitroprusside or D600 did not differ among the three solutions. Relaxant responses to isoproterenol were also depressed in artificial buffered solutions. Endothelial damage eliminated relaxant responses to acetylcholine and A23187, as well as the difference in responsiveness to KCl and isoproterenol noted in artificial buffered compared with bicarbonate-buffered solutions. Within the same solution, endothelial damage alone did not alter the responsiveness to KCl or histamine. Total and La -resistant Ca++ binding was similar in all three buffered solutions. Thus, contractile responses are not depressed in Tris- or N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid-buffered solutions, whereas endothelium-dependent relaxations are attenuated in similar solutions. Overall, the results imply that, in artificial buffered solutions, the production and/or release of an endothelium derived relaxing factor is attenuated or that its action on aortic smooth muscle is, in some manner, functionally antagonized.\r"

STZ-diabetic rats (8-10 weeks) were supersensitive to the negative chronotropic effects of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine and bethanechol; inotropic responses to these muscarinic agonists were unaltered. This phenomenon was associated with a decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity but no change in the rate and extent of neuronal choline uptake. [3H]N-methylscopolamine bound to muscarinic receptors in atria from both groups of rats with the same high affinity. The density of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding sites, however, was 34% lower in atria from STZ-diabetic rats. Agonist binding affinity was lower in diabetes; carbamylcholine had a lower affinity for both the high- and low-affinity receptors. These results indicate that cardiac cholinergic supersensitivity in right atria in diabetes occurs before the development of autonomic neuropathy insofar as neuronal [3H]choline uptake is unaltered at this stage of STZ diabetes. Changes in agonist binding conformation, without a concomitant change in antagonist binding affinity, suggest that supersensitivity of right atria to muscarinic agonist may be a consequence of altered coupling of muscarinic receptor to transduction mechanisms involved in chronotropism in diabetes.\r"

This effect of ethanol was concentration-dependent and was affected by the membrane potential. Under depolarizing conditions ethanol was significantly more potent at inhibiting [3H]BTX-B binding. Scatchard analysis of [3H]BTX-B binding revealed that ethanol increased the equilibrium binding constant without affecting the apparent maximum number of binding sites. The rate of formation of the [3H]BTX-B/receptor complex was unchanged in the presence of ethanol whereas the rate of dissociation was accelerated by ethanol. These findings are consistent with an indirect allosteric mechanism for inhibition of [3H]BTX-B binding. The binding of [3H]saxitoxin was unaffected by ethanol suggesting that the specific receptor sites in the channel display differential sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of ethanol. These data, in conjunction with ion flux measurements, provide further evidence that ethanol can affect the voltage-sensitive sodium channels in neuronal membranes.\r"

Fluorescence measurements were used to assess the intrinsic order or fluidity and the sensitivity to ethanol of rat forebrain synaptic plasma membranes at various intervals during and after chronic ethanol treatment. Acute ethanol administration had no significant effect on neurotoxin binding in the absence or presence of ethanol in vitro or on sodium uptake in the absence of ethanol in vitro. However, a single dose of ethanol produced a dose and time-dependent attenuation of the inhibitory effect of ethanol on sodium uptake, suggestive of acute tolerance. Chronic ethanol treatment reduced the influx of 22Na+ in the presence of batrachotoxin and diminished the inhibitory effect of ethanol in vitro on sodium uptake for up to 20 days after withdrawal, but the specific binding of the neurotoxin in the presence or absence of ethanol was unchanged. Synaptic plasma membranes from chronic ethanol-treated rats showed no change in intrinsic order but the disordering effect of ethanol was significantly smaller for up to 20 days after withdrawal. Results of this study demonstrate that brain tissue from ethanol-treated rats can adapt rapidly to some effects of ethanol and that chronic ethanol administration can reduce the effects of ethanol on physical and functional properties of neurons for a prolonged period of time.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of dopamine in the modulation of colonic motility we evaluated the effect of dopamine on basal rectosigmoid motor activity before and after treatment with domperidone, phentolamine, propranolol, atropine or placebo in 12 healthy subjects. We also investigated the role of dopamine on the postprandial gastrocolic response. Basal motility index was 126 +/- 38. Dopamine (5-100 micrograms/kg) generated dose-dependent contractions with a frequency of 3 cpm. At 50 micrograms/kg dopamine produced a motility index of 2066 +/- 631. Pretreatment with domperidone (0.4 mg/kg) significantly decreased the amplitude of contractions induced by dopamine but had no effect on the frequency. The motility index was reduced to 668 +/- 148. In contrast atropine, phentolamine and propranolol had no effect on dopamine-stimulated motility. Furthermore, domperidone significantly attenuated the postprandial gastrocolic response compared to placebo. The motility indices of the early and late gastrocolic response were reduced by 65 +/- 12 and 70 +/- 10% of control, respectively. These studies indicate that dopamine stimulates rectosigmoid motility in contrast to its known inhibitory effect on upper gastrointestinal motility. This appears to be mediated by specific dopamine receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Serotonin (5-HT)-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis is mediated by the 5-HT-2 receptor in rat cerebral cortex and by the 5-HT-1c receptor in rat choroid plexus. These systems were used to determine relative efficacies of piperazine derivatives at the 5-HT-2 and 5-HT-1c receptors. Both quipazine and 6-chloro-2-[1-piperazinyl]-pyrazine (MK-212) stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cerebral cortex, and these effects were blocked by ketanserin. The maximum responses to these agonists were 80% of the maximum response to 5-HT. m-Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (MCPP) and 1-(1-naphthyl)-piperazine (1-NP) did not stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cerebral cortex at concentrations that blocked the effect of 5-HT. In the choroid plexus, TFMPP and MCPP, as well as MK-212 and quipazine, increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis and mianserin blocked these effects. MK-212 had an efficacy which was equal to that of 5-HT, whereas quipazine, MCPP and TFMPP were partial agonists in the choroid plexus. 1-NP did not stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in choroid plexus but completely blocked the effect 5-HT. On the basis of these data, we conclude that quipazine and MK-212 are partial agonists at 5-HT-2 receptors in cerebral cortex, whereas 1-NP, TFMPP and MCPP are pure antagonists of the cortical 5-HT-2 receptor. However, TFMPP and MCPP as well as quipazine and MK-212 are agonists at the 5-HT-1c receptor, while 1-NP is a pure antagonist of the 5-HT-1c receptor in choroid plexus.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between curare-induced mediator release and contraction in superfused guinea pig trachea and parenchymal strips was examined. In trachea, curare produced histamine release and contraction with peak release occurring in the first 90 sec (collection period 1) after challenge. Peak contraction developed later (collection periods 4-6). Curare-induced contraction of parenchymal strips was inconsistent and smaller than that found in trachea. No histamine could be detected in parenchymal strip superfusate samples. Curare also was selective in releasing histamine from monodispersed airway cells vs. peripheral lung cells. No leukotriene bioactivity or immunoreactivity could be detected after curare challenge of tissues or cell suspensions. Tracheal contractions, but not histamine release, occurring early (first 5 or 6 collection periods) after challenge were antagonized by mepyramine, 10(-6) M, and phenoxybenzamine, 3 X 10(-5) M. Combination of FPL55712, 10(-5) M, with mepyramine did not further alter tracheal contraction. Contractions occurring later after challenge and total histamine release were enhanced by indomethacin, 5 X 10(-6) M. Indomethacin also increased contractions in the presence of mepyramine. With mepyramine and indomethacin, LY171883, 1 and 3 X 10(-6) M, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, 3 X 10(-5) M, antagonized tracheal contractions to curare, 3 X 10(-3) M, but not to 1 X 10(-3) M, without altering histamine release. Indomethacin prolonged return to base line of tracheal tension after challenge with exogenous histamine. After addition of LY171883 or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, the return of tracheal tension after histamine was not different from that seen without drug pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Segments were incubated in physiological salt solution (PSS) containing Ca++ (1.6 mM) and an optimal preload was applied. Myogenic or stretch-induced tone was studied in two ways. Vessels were stretched in PSS at 28 degrees C and the bath temperature was gradually increased in a standard manner. Alternatively, vessels stretched at 42 degrees C were placed in zero-Ca++ PSS at the same temperature and responses to readmission of Ca++ to the PSS recorded. TPA (0.01 or 0.1 microM for 1 hr), a protein kinase C activator, consistently enhanced myogenic responses to stretch initiated by either procedure. It had very little effect or even depressed the tone due to histamine of high K+. The selective effect of protein kinase C activation on stretch-induced, Ca++-dependent myogenic tone argues for a pathway in this vessel activated selectively by stretch that may be modulated by protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms. It is proposed that stretch of the rabbit facial vein opens specific Ca++ entry pathways; the interaction of TPA with those pathways may be such that TPA increases Ca++ sensitivity or availability.\r"

These effects were compared with those produced by the active form of ibopamine, epinine, and with the standard DA-1 receptor agonists, dopamine and fenoldopam. After pretreatment of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs with phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg i.v.) and propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) to block alpha and beta adrenoceptor-mediated effects, respectively, the renal blood flow responses to i.v. administration of ibopamine, epinine, dopamine and fenoldopam were determined before and after selective blockade of DA-1 receptors by i.v. infusion of SK&F R-83566 (0.5 microgram/kg/min). Under control conditions, ibopamine produced a dose-dependent increase in renal blood flow as a result of renal vasodilation (i.e., decrease in renal vascular resistance), and was approximately 10-fold less potent than epinine in this respect. Epinine elicited qualitatively similar renal hemodynamic changes to ibopamine with the exception of potency. Dopamine was approximately equipotent with epinine as a renal vasodilator, and both compounds were 10-fold less potent than fenoldopam. Concurrent with the renal vasodilation produced by all four compounds, there was a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. After the administration of SK&F R-83566, the renal vasodilator responses to fenoldopam were antagonized markedly with an approximate 30-fold rightward shift in the log dose-response curve, whereas the renal vasodilator responses to dopamine were abolished completely and converted into small vasoconstrictor responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Opioid peptides have been shown to modulate the function of cells associated with host defense. Both opiate and nonopiate receptor mechanisms have been shown to mediate cell responses to these peptides. In this study we used a ferricytochrome C reduction microassay to measure superoxide (O2-) production by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes after stimulation with beta-endorphin (beta-END). beta-END was found to stimulate O2- release at concentrations from 10(-14) to 10(-8) M; the peak response occurred at 10(-12) M. A microassay based on the horseradish peroxidase-mediated oxidation of phenol red was used to demonstrate the production of hydrogen peroxide H2O2, by beta-END at 10(-12) M. The accumulation of H2O2 was reduced by the inhibitor, nitroprusside, and by the converting enzyme, catalase. The accumulation of O2- in response to the potent chemotactic peptide formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine was studied and a distinctly different dose-response profile with a peak response at 10(-8) M was observed. Because beta-END can apparently bind to and activate cellular functions by nonopiate receptors, N-acetyl-beta-END was tested. At doses between 10(-14) and 10(-8) M, it failed to effect O2- accumulation. Moreover, (-)-naloxone 10(-12) M was shown to completely abolish the stimulatory effect of equimolar beta-END whereas (+)-naloxone was entirely ineffective. At 10(-8) M both stereoisomers also failed to inhibit formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine 10(-8) M. Thus, at the picomolar concentration present in the human systemic circulation, beta-END activates oxygen metabolism by polymorphonuclear leukocytes through stereoselective, naloxone-sensitive opiate receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The results of a number of studies have implicated beta adrenergic receptors in the brain in the actions of proven antidepressant drugs. This suspected involvement of central beta adrenergic receptors made it of interest to characterize the behavioral effects of centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists. Clenbuterol and prenalterol, unlike most beta adrenergic agonists, penetrate into the central nervous system after peripheral administration. In the present study, the effects of these agonists on behavior maintained under a multiple fixed-interval 5-min, fixed-ratio 30-response schedule were determined. Both compounds, in a dose-dependent manner, reduced response rate under both components of the multiple schedule. Under the fixed-interval component, clenbuterol and prenalterol altered the temporal pattern of responding. At no dose tested was there evidence for any stimulant action of either of the drugs. The effects of clenbuterol and prenalterol on behavior maintained under the multiple schedule appeared to be a result of an interaction of the agonists with beta adrenergic receptors. This was evidenced by the ability of the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol to block the effects of the agonists. The behavioral effects of clenbuterol and prenalterol appear, in general, to be similar to effects reported previously for tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibiting antidepressant drugs.\r"

  ".W": "In various anxiolytic tests, benzodiazepines produce a maximal anxiolytic response only upon repeated treatment. The question arises as to whether repeated treatment produces an increase in anxiolytic efficacy or a decrease in another benzodiazepine-mediated effect (i.e., muscle relaxation/sedation) that functions to attenuate the full expression of the anxiolytic response. To address this issue, rats were pretreated in their home cages with either vehicle, diazepam or CGS 9896 (a nonsedating, non-muscle relaxant partial benzodiazepine agonist with anxiolytic efficacy) and challenged, 7 days later, with either diazepam or CGS 9896 in either a conflict (anxiolytic efficacy) or a rotorod (muscle relaxant/sedative effects) procedure. Rats who first experienced diazepam in the test situation (vehicle home cage pretreatment) showed only a moderate anxiolytic response and a compromised motor response. Pretreatment with diazepam in the home cage produced a tolerance to the motor-decreasing effects of diazepam and induced a maximal anxiolytic effect upon first challenge with diazepam in the test situation. CGS 9896, on the other hand, produced a maximal anxiolytic effect regardless of home cage pretreatment. Home cage pretreatment with CGS 9896 did not obviate the muscle relaxant/sedative or submaximal anxiolytic effects of diazepam, suggesting that repeated exposure to an anxiolytic effect is not the underlying basis for the repeated benzodiazepine treatment phenomenon. Rather, the motor-impairing effects of the benzodiazepines cause the submaximal response noted upon first exposure to these drugs in the anxiolytic test situation. This effect tolerates, leaving the expression of the maximal response.\r"

Basal short-circuit current was not altered by tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium or muscarinic antagonists. The neurally evoked response was not altered by hexamethonium, but was reduced by muscarinic antagonists with a rank order of potency: atropine = 4-diphenyl acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine greater than pirenzepine. 1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide increased resting short-circuit current above basal levels. Carbachol and bethanechol evoked a concentration-dependent increase in short-circuit current that was reduced by tetrodotoxin. The effects of carbachol were antagonized by hexamethonium, 4-diphenyl acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine and pirenzepine. Competition for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding indicated a rank order of potency of 4-diphenyl acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine greater than pirenzepine greater than carbachol greater than bethanechol. These studies indicate that cholinergic and noncholinergic transmission play a significant role in regulation of chloride transport in the guinea pig distal colon. Both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors on neurons that project to the mucosa as well as epithelial muscarinic receptors are mediators of the chloride secretory response.\r"

It inhibited acid secretion in dogs (p.o.) prepared with innervated gastric pouches (ED50 = 0.2 mg/kg) and in the pylorus-ligated rat (ED50 = 0.43 mg/kg). ED50 values for ranitidine were 0.9 mg/kg (dog) and 9.97 mg/kg (rat). After an 18-hr pretreatment period with doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o., inhibition of acid secretion in the rat barely exceeded 50%, indicating that the duration of action of Wy-45,727 was not excessive.

Ketanserin inhibited the contraction both in the basilar and tail arteries competitively, with pA2 = 9.35 and 9.09, respectively, suggesting mediation by 5-HT2 receptors. The inhibition by cyproheptadine and methysergide (of the response in the basilar artery) was noncompetitive. High potassium in the buffer solution contracted the basilar and tail arteries biphasically, including prazosin-sensitive alpha-adrenoceptor activation in the latter. Cyproheptadine, nimodipine, verapamil and diltiazem inhibited the 5-HT-induced contraction in the mentioned order of potency. Verapamil was more potent than diltiazem, also in the tail artery, but nimodipine inhibited the contraction only by 35%. Also the (tonic) contraction induced by high potassium concentration was attenuated, with the same relative potency as in the presence of 5-HT except for cyproheptadine, which was less efficient than nimodipine. The transient potassium-induced contraction was inhibited less effectively by the calcium antagonists. The IC50 values were characteristically lower in the basilar than in the tail artery, irrespective of whether the contraction had been produced by 5-HT or high potassium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87283375\r", 
  ".W": "The vasopressor response to sympathetic stimulation in the pithed rat was characterized both by analyzing the effects of chemical sympathectomy, adrenalectomy and selective antagonists on the vasopressor response and by measurement of changes in plasma concentrations of catecholamines. Stimulation of the spinal sympathetic outflow evoked a biphasic pressor response: an initial transient component was caused mainly by postganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation (the direct response); a slowly developing secondary component was mediated predominantly by circulating catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla (the adrenal response). Parallel analysis of plasma catecholamines showed that the rise in epinephrine appeared to be closely related to this adrenal component. The pressor response in adrenalectomized rats was selectively blocked by prazosin but not by yohimbine; however, in sympathectomized rats, the pressor response was abolished by prazosin and yohimbine together but not by either drug given alone. These results suggest that the direct, neurogenic component is mediated mainly by alpha-1 adrenoceptors whereas the secondary, adrenally mediated response occurs by activation of both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the in vivo regulation of each component of the pressor response was studied in rats harboring pheochromocytoma (PHEO), a tumor causing marked elevations in endogenous catecholamine concentrations. In PHEO rats, the direct pressor response was found to be relatively intact but the adrenal response was blunted. Inasmuch as there was normal rise in plasma epinephrine to electrical stimulation in PHEO rats, the results suggest a differential regulation of neuronally stimulated and blood-borne catecholamine-mediated pressor responses in PHEO rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ED50 values of these peptides were 510.0, 8.2 and 2.0 pmol, respectively, when administered i.c.v. in the mouse tail-pressure test (dermorphin = 5.7 pmol and morphine = 1.2 nmol). These activities were remarkably potent and relatively long lasting. Their IC50 values were 676.8, 23.1 and 6.6 nM, respectively (dermorphin = 3.75 and morphine = 214.3 nM) in the guinea pig isolated ileum assay, and 138.50, 5.25 and 1.10 nM, respectively (dermorphin = 3.80 and morphine = 28.00 nM) in the radioreceptor assay utilizing [3H]naloxone as the opioid receptor ligand. In the evaluation of their inhibitory effects to enkephalin-degrading enzymes, the IC50 values of H-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Gly-OH, H-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Sar-OH and H-Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly-OH were 5.4, 14.5 and more than 50.0 microM, respectively (bestatin = 0.1 microM) against aminopeptidase and 1.18, 1.40 and more than 50.0 microM, respectively (captopril = 0.38 and D-Phe-2S-, 3R-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoic acid = more than 100 microM) against the cleaving enzymes of enkephalin at its Gly3-Phe4 bond. The authors suggest that the marked antinociceptive potency of H-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Gly-OH and H-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Sar-OH is mainly due to high opioid receptor affinity. Their inhibitory effects on enkephalin-degrading enzymes and enzymatic stability also greatly contribute to their potent and long-lasting opioid activities.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the transport system by which benzylpenicillin, an organic anion, is accumulated by the isolated rat choroid plexus, kinetic analysis of benzylpenicillin transport was performed. Accumulation of benzylpenicillin was against an electrochemical potential gradient via a saturable process (Km = 58 microM and Vmax = 84 nmol/ml of tissue per min) that was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents (p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide), metabolic inhibitors (KCN and 2,4-dinitrophenol) and anion exchange inhibitors (4-acetamide-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), but is major transport system did not require the inward Na+ gradient. Organic anions, such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, homovanillic acid, p-aminohippuric acid and probenecid inhibited the accumulation of benzylpenicillin, whereas dipeptides did not affect it. Kinetic analysis of the accumulation of benzylpenicillin suggests that both phenoxymethylpenicillin and cefpiramide are also transported via the benzylpenicillin transport system. Other penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives inhibited the accumulation of benzylpenicillin with different affinities. Penicillin derivatives without dissociating groups in the side chain had the higher affinity for the benzylpenicillin transport system than other beta-lactam antibiotics did. Among penicillin derivatives examined, a good correlation (r = 0.92) was observed between the lipophilicity and the affinity for the benzylpenicillin transport system, whereas no correlation was observed among the cephalosporin derivatives. These findings suggest that the major transport system of benzylpenicillin in the rat choroid plexus is via a carrier-mediated active anion transport process which is distinct from that of dipeptides, and does not require the inward Na+ gradient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the psychotropic drug minaprine on brain ischemia induced by a 5-min bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries in the mongolian gerbil was studied. Severe impairment of memory was apparent when the passive avoidance test was carried out 2 days after the bilaterally induced ischemia. When minaprine in a dose of 50 mg/kg was given p.o. 30 min before the 5-min occlusion, there was a significant improvement in the memory impairment. The amplitude of the hippocampal theta waves decreased and Nissl's degradation was apparent in the CA1 neurons in the hippocampus from 2 days after the 5-min occlusion. Changes in the hippocampal neurons were exacerbated with time. When minaprine in a dose of 50 mg/kg was given there was no decrease in the amplitude of hippocampal theta waves, and Nissl's degradation and the destruction and disappearance of the CA1 neurons diminished considerably. All these findings indicate that minaprine warrants further study for possible clinical prescription.\r"

In contrast to taxol, the major hydrolysis product, baccatin III, has little cytotoxic activity and does not promote in vitro microtubule assembly. In cell culture medium, the concentration of taxol decreases with time and 7-epitaxol, which exhibits properties comparable to those of taxol both on cells and on in vitro microtubuli polymerization, is formed. Baccatin III is found in small quantities in the cell medium, although it is barely detectable within the cells. It is concluded that 7-epitaxol is the major derivative of taxol found in cells and that its presence does not alter, in a major way, the overall biological activity of taxol.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines both the local and neurally mediated effects of sufentanil, a new synthetic opioid, on the vascular resistance of the isolated, separately perfused canine gracilis muscle. Infusions (50 micrograms/min) of sufentanil into the gracilis arteries of nine denervated gracilis muscles did not produce a direct vascular effect. Because morphine has been previously shown to produce a central sympatholytic effect, the neural effect of sufentanil was examined in 12 innervated muscles under conditions of either low or high background sympathetic activity produced by either hemorrhage or transfusion of the dog. After i.v. sufentanil (20 micrograms/kg), all dogs experienced a rapid parallel fall in gracilis vascular resistance (GVR) and mean arterial pressure. The GVR decreased under conditions of high and low sympathetic activity. With low sympathetic tone, the GVR decreased from a control value of 24.1 +/- 4.4 S.E.M. to 6.6 +/- 0.8 resistance units (RU), a value below the subsequently denervated level (13.2 +/- 2.5 RU) (P less than .05). In hemorrhaged animals with elevated control sympathetic tone, resistance declined from 38.4 +/- 9.1 to 26.1 +/- 4.4 RU (P less than .05) but did not reach the denervated level (12.4 +/- 2.7 RU). Local intra-arterial pharmacologic blockade of the gracilis muscle was performed in animals with low sympathetic tone. Intra-arterial atropine did not effect the neurogenic vasodilatory response to sufentanil, whereas prazosin abolished it. Intra-arterial H1 and H2 receptor blockade prevented the decline of GVR secondary to sufentanil below the denervated level. Thus, vasodilation associated with sufentanil administration is mediated solely through neurogenic mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87283384\r", 
  ".W": "Many antidepressant drugs, when administered chronically to rats, have been shown to produce decreases in the density of beta adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system. The centrally active beta adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol is currently being evaluated clinically as an antidepressant. The chronic administration of this drug to rats resulted in a large decrease in the density of beta adrenergic receptors in some areas of the rat brain but not in others. Thus, autoradiographic studies revealed that the total density of beta adrenergic receptors in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, but not in layers 1 to 3 or layer 4 of the cerebral cortex, was decreased. To examine whether this regional selectivity occurred because of differences in plasticity of cerebellum and cortex or because cerebellum contains mainly beta-2 adrenergic receptors and cortex contains mainly beta-1 adrenergic receptors, separate analyses of the subtypes of beta adrenergic receptors were performed in each area. These experiments indicated that the decrease in receptor density was entirely specific for beta-2 adrenergic receptors, whereas the density of beta-1 receptors was unchanged. Thus, even in layers 1 to 3 and layer 4 of the cerebral cortex, beta-2 receptor density was decreased, with no change in beta-1 receptor density. Using the autoradiographic assay for ligand binding, it was shown that clenbuterol has equal affinity for beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, indicating that the selective effect of this drug was not due to a selective affinity for beta-2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The object of this study was to determine the molecular species of verapamil (Vp) which is responsible for the negative inotropic activity of the drug. Toward this end, we developed a model system which allowed us to determine the concentrations of protonated and neutral Vp and four congeners in solution and bound to an amphiphilic interface. We then determined the effect of Vp and these congeners on twitch tension in sheep trabecular muscle and correlated species abundance with biologic activity. The cumulative log dose-response curves of Vp, acyano-Vp and nor-Vp were sigmoidal. The concentrations of drug which were required to inhibit twitch tension by 50% (IC50) were 1000 +/- 240, 3350 +/- 620 and 7140 +/- 950 nM, respectively (mean +/- S.D.; P less than .01). Quaternary-Vp, an amphiphilic, nonionizable protonated derivative, produced some nonspecific inhibition which never reached 50%. Tetrahydroxy-Vp, a hydrophilic ionizable derivative, was inactive. Concentrations of the membrane-bound, neutral form of Vp, acyano-Vp and nor-Vp were comparable at their IC50 values (86 +/- 19, 104 +/- 19 and 121 +/- 16 nM, respectively; mean +/- S.D.; P, N.S.). In contrast, the concentrations of the membrane-bound, protonated form were significantly different and accounted for the \"apparent\" difference in the IC50 values. Based on these data, we conclude that: 1) ionizability and amphiphilicity are required for the negative inotropic effects of verapamil, acyano-Vp and nor-Vp; 2) twitch tension correlates best with the concentration of the membrane-bound neutral form of each drug; and 3) the potency differences between Vp, acyano-Vp and nor-Vp, as reflected by their IC50 values, are apparent, not real.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists phentolamine and yohimbine to antagonize cocaine-induced hepatotoxicity was determined in phenobarbital-induced B6C3/F1 mice. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the histologic extent of necrosis, incidence of latent lethality and increases in serum alanine aminotransferase activity. The depression of hepatic glutathione levels also were measured. The administration of a single 5-mg/kg dose of phentolamine antagonized the decrease in glutathione levels and the elevation of aminotransferase activity caused by a 60-mg/kg dose of cocaine. Similar results were obtained in mice pretreated with the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine. Whereas the duration of antagonism could be extended by administering a 30-mg/kg dose of yohimbine, the magnitude of the antagonism was not increased. In contrast to the experiments with the larger dose, multiple hourly doses of 2.5 mg/kg of yohimbine increased both the duration of antagonism and the magnitude of protection against the hepatotoxicity produced by cocaine. Yohimbine pretreatment reduced cocaine-induced latent lethality by 50%, but did not alter the time to lethality. The results of these experiments indicate that the alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist reduces the toxicity of cocaine rather than merely delaying its time of onset. This effect does not appear to result from an inhibition of the toxic metabolite(s) of cocaine, as a 10-fold molar excess of yohimbine failed to antagonize lipid peroxidation caused by in vitro incubation of cocaine with hepatic microsomes. Additional experiments in mice whose liver metabolism had not been induced by prior pretreatment with phenobarbital revealed that 60 mg/kg of cocaine lowered glutathione but was not hepatotoxic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87283389\r", 
  ".W": "S-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione (CEG; 270 mumol/kg) produced renal lesions that were confined to the proximal tubules of the outer stripe of the outer medulla and were similar to those lesions produced by the cysteine analog S-(2-chloroethyl)cysteine or by the nephrotoxic glutathione (GSH) adduct of 2-bromohydroquinone. These histopathologic changes in the kidney were correlated with alterations in renal function as reflected by dose- and time-dependent elevations in blood urea nitrogen levels as well as by the increased urinary excretion of protein, glucose and lactate dehydrogenase activity. The role of renal GSH metabolism as a mediating factor in the nephrotoxicity of these GSH conjugates was investigated by administering the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase inhibitor AT-125 [L-(alpha-S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid]. Treatment with AT-125 led to a dose-dependent decrease in renal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity that correlated inversely with increased GSH concentrations in the urine and kidney. Pretreatment with AT-125 ameliorated 2-bromohydroguinone-induced renal toxicity but did not protect against the CEG-induced renal lesion. In fact, pretreatment with AT-125 produced a dose-dependent potentiation of CEG renal toxicity. The CEG-induced renal lesion was dependent on a probenecid-sensitive transport system that was not involved in the toxicity of 2-bromohydroguinone. These studies demonstrate that CEG need not be metabolized by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to the corresponding cysteine adduct [S-(2-chloroethyl)cysteine] in order to enter renal tubule cells and ultimately exert its nephrotoxic action.\r"

Serum urea nitrogen was significantly elevated by day 4 and continued to rise, whereas serum creatinine was not elevated above control until day 10. Morphologic examination of perfusion-fixed kidneys from cyclosporine-treated rats revealed focal areas of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in the outer cortex and a generalized increase in interstitial cells in the outer medulla. No areas of acute tubular necrosis were identified. The effect of this dose of cyclosporine on renal hemodynamics was examined in conscious restrained rats. Renal blood flow, measured by microsphere injection, was 70% of control after four daily doses and remained near this level after eight daily doses. The glomerular filtration rate, measured by iodothalamate clearance, was 70% of control after four doses but fell to 34% of control after eight doses. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into renal DNA was used as a sensitive index of renal cell proliferation after cyclosporine administration (100 mg/kg/day). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was increased over control 3-fold in the outer cortex, 7-fold in the inner cortex and 11-fold in the medullary-papillary regions of the kidney after eight daily doses of cyclosporine. Histoautoradiographic examination of renal sections revealed an increase in the number of labeled nuclei in all three regions of the kidney from rats treated with cyclosporine. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that the majority of proliferating cells were located in the interstitium and not in renal tubules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When compared to other modes of P administration, the area under the curve during the first eight hours was twice as high with the rectal route. With 50 and 100 mg P given sublingually and 100 and 200 mg ingested as tablets, peak levels and area under the curve were twice as high with the higher dosage. The response was more sustained with the higher dosage. All subjects exhibited a significant increase in serum P levels over baseline that persisted for at least eight hours. P levels were still increased over baseline at 24 hours in all subjects after the administration of 100-mg vaginal and rectal suppositories and 200-mg tablets. These findings are in general agreement with previous reports showing that luteal phase serum P concentrations can be reached easily with non-parenteral modes of administering micronized P and that oral P administration could become an attractive alternative to the currently used oral mode of administering synthetic progestins.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two healthy young women, less than 16 weeks pregnant, with normal hematologic status, were selected at random to receive either a multivitamin/multimineral with 65 mg of iron or one without iron. During pregnancy and the puerperium, a full hematologic evaluation of the iron, folate and B12 status was performed. Those receiving the multivitamin without iron had significantly lower mean serum ferritin levels (P less than .05). During the study, 9 of these 21 noniron subjects (43%) failed to maintain an acceptable hemoglobin level (greater than 11.0 g/dL) and were medicated with 110 mg ferrous iron daily. Use of the multivitamin/multimineral supplement with iron during pregnancy and for 12 weeks postpartum maintained maternal iron stores, eliminated the need for additional iron medication and prevented the development of iron deficiency anemia. This 36-week longitudinal evaluation demonstrated the need for iron supplementation during pregnancy and for three months postpartum. Measurements of serum ferritin at 16-20 weeks of pregnancy will detect hematologic risk in young pregnant women not identified by usual hematologic assessments. The results of this study show that adequate maternal iron stores during pregnancy and the puerperium cannot be maintained by prevailing dietary patterns and therefore that iron supplementation is essential.\r"

At least part of the clinical heterogeneity is associated with serological heterogeneity and this is particularly striking among patients with SLE who produce anti-Ro(SSA) and anti-La(SSB). Certain subsets within the lupus spectrum are closely associated with the anti-Ro(SSA) response. These include subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, the lupus like syndrome associated with homozygous C2 and C4 deficiency, and neonatal lupus erythematosus. Moreover, among the patients with SLE who produce anti-Ro(SSA) are 2 stable groups, on which produces anti-Ro(SSA) alone and one which produces both anti-Ro(SSA) and anti-La(SSB). Clear clinical and serological differences distinguish these groups and it is hypothesized that these differences are due to genetic differences in the HLA-D region. Exact identification of the genes involved and how they control immune responses should lead to a clearer understanding of the clinical phenomena seen in these patients.\r"

The incidence of cardiolipin antibodies was as great in SLE as in women with clinically unexplained recurrent abortions. The anticardiolipin levels remained unchanged in most patients for long periods and were remarkably unaffected by disease activity and therapy. On the other hand, in several cases the activated partial thromboplastin time which was prolonged in most patients with persistently high cardiolipin antibody levels, approached normal during treatment with prednisolone and salicylic acid. This seemed to facilitate a successful outcome of pregnancy. Absorption of sera with cardiolipin and other negatively charged phospholipids but not with uncharged phospholipids abolished the anticardiolipin activity in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In most sera with cardiolipin antibody levels greater than 10 units complement activation by the classical pathway could be demonstrated. Whether the anticardiolipin antibodies contributed to complement activation could not be determined.\r"

We purified D peptide from U1 snRNP and established a radioimmunoassay.

The membrane attack complex forms transmembrane channels that vary in size depending on the number of C9 molecules incorporated into the complex. The C5b-8 complex forms small channels and at high multiplicity can kill nucleated cells. At least 12 C9 molecules are required to form tubular poly C9 which evokes the ultrastructural image of the classical membrane lesion produced by complement. The membranes of erythrocytes and other blood cells contain a 70,000 dalton protein that can inhibit channel formation by the membrane attack complex. This protein is species specific and has been called homologous restriction factor. A cytotoxic protein immunochemically related to C9 was isolated from cytotoxic human large granular lymphocytes and from OKT3 activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the presence of Ca++, isolated C9 related protein (C9RP) formed circular structures that resembled poly C9. C9RP efficiently killed K562 cells, human melanoma cells, Raji cells and human large granular lymphocytes. The results suggest that the channel forming protein of cytotoxic lymphocytes and C9 of complement have a common evolutionary ancestry.\r"

In local immune complex formation endogenous or planted molecules serve as antigens. Subepithelial immune deposits arise mainly by local formation of immune deposits. Charge-charge interactions contribute to planting of antigens in glomeruli or to initial binding of immune complexes to glomeruli.

When these dangerous answer scores were compared with their conventional percent-correct scores, it was found that 3 percent of the candidates who failed the examinations by conventional scoring had fewer than the average dangerous incorrect answers.

Ninety-two candidates who passed and who selected four or more dangerous answers were tracked through the certification process to learn whether labeling them as \"smart but dangerous\" was justified. Reports of their clinical competence from their residency programs did not relate dangerous behavior for any of these candidates. The 86 of these 92 candidates who subsequently took the ABA oral examination had pass rates that were identical to those of all candidates in 1983 and that were completely independent of the candidates' absolute and relative frequency of choosing dangerous answers. It is concluded that selection of dangerous answers in a multiple-choice test is the result of lack of information rather than a purposeful action and implementation of the scoring system for dangerous answers would likely be unjustified and unfairly punitive.\r"

  ".W": "A new format for training medical school faculty members was begun in 1978 when the federal government and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation simultaneously began funding separate faculty development programs for family medicine faculty members. The goals of these two programs were to recruit and prepare new physician faculty members for family medicine educational programs. In the present study, the authors assessed the impact of these programs by a review of grant proposals and a survey of alumni for each program. They found that very different fellowship programs developed under these two funding sources. Consequently, the two programs produced participants who went to different academic settings and became involved in quite different activities, especially in the area of scholarly work. However, regardless of the program the participants chose, common factors were found to characterize those who were active in scholarly areas and those who were less active. Based on these findings, recommendations are offered to future planners and funders of faculty development programs for preparing new physician faculty members.\r"

Self-report data were collected from 466 residents in six states on personal or emotional problems and on alcohol use, cigarette smoking, weight, diet, and exercise. The study provides evidence that the women residents experienced a higher incidence and greater severity of personal or emotional problems than men and that these problems were associated with an increased percentage of women than men who had used alcohol during the preceding year, had used alcohol daily, had increased use of alcohol over the two years before the survey, and had had perceptions of being overweight and were on calorie restricted diets. The gender differences in cigarette smoking and frequency of exercise were not significant. The author concludes that residency programs need to provide flexible programs that would better accommodate women's needs and to help residents develop healthy strategies for dealing with stress.\r"

However, the number of \"false negatives\" was high; that is, a large number of students predicted not to graduate did graduate. Psychological tests--consisting of personality, interest, and intelligence tests--were not statistically significant in predicting graduation. Neither the interviews nor the tests correctly predicted the students' mental or physical health or their occupational or marital adjustment as of 1982, as measured by replies to a questionnaire from more than 90 percent of the students in the original study who could be located. There is some subjective evidence that moderate degrees of anxiety, immaturity, and compulsivity are not associated with failure to complete medical school but that passivity, withdrawal, and weak motivation are. Although psychiatric interviewing of applicants is not now feasible because of legal restrictions, some of the findings of the study reported here may be useful for admission interviewers and as a basis for further research.\r"

Third-year medical students in two consecutive academic years at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry received either feedback from a faculty member on a videotaped interview between the students and a simulated patient (SP) or direct feedback from a PI immediately following the students' interview with the PI. The students in the PI group gave higher ratings to the realism and effectiveness of the interview session than did students in the SP group. Students in both groups rated PI feedback as more helpful than videotaped review, even though they had experienced only one of these two methods. This exercise represents a new use of patient instructors that may also be applicable to teaching counseling skills in other areas of behavioral medicine.\r"

Content analysis of their narrative comments and analysis of their global ratings of the student reports revealed marked disparities in the criteria the different assessors felt were important and an unacceptable spread in the ratings assigned to the reports. The study showed that the current case report assessment method was unreliable and that it should be replaced by a standardized assessment instrument.\r"

Following the introduction of the fines, the usage rates both for drivers and front seat passengers increased from about 60% to more than 90%. The number of car occupant fatalities has lowered considerably since the introduction of the fine (by about 25%). Approximately 15 to 20 percentage points of this change are probably due to this measure. Major injuries decreased noticeably as well, in particular injuries to the eyes. Belt usage on back seats is still unsatisfactory (20%), although here too, the effect on injuries of the belt is incontestable, taking into consideration occupant interaction.\r"

Six recent cases are presented in which fatal injury was caused by underarm use of shoulder belts. Lacerations of the liver, spleen, intestines, mesentery, diaphragm, and aorta, and spine injury have occurred in accidents, most of which should have been survivable. The motoring public must be warned that underarm use of shoulder belts is hazardous and may cause fatal injuries in otherwise survivable accidents.\r"

Preliminary data document benefits in reduced serious and fatal casualties and in insurance claims. Greater emphasis must be given to higher levels of enforcement if usage is to reach 75-80%. With substantially increased belt use, the effectiveness of belts, as well as their limitations, and of laws mandating their use, can be evaluated adequately. Also, other consequences of belts can be monitored more closely to determine their relative importance.\r"

He serves as chairman of the state's traffic safety commission. In his first campaign for election in 1970, Austin included in his traffic safety program a proposal for safety belt legislation, as the best way to encourage usage. His opponent was opposed. In each of three campaigns for re-election and at every opportunity, Austin urged usage and advocated mandatory safety belt legislation. Michigan enacted a safety belt law in 1985, culminating a 14-year struggle for Austin. In this article he shares some of his experience and views.\r"

The 11 states collectively had a mean of 8.8 and a standard deviation of 3.6 fatalities per month among young children. Such small frequency counts resulted in a large proportion of the variation being random. Statistical power analyses found fatality reductions of 20% to 25% following the child restraint laws would be statistically significant. Reductions of such a magnitude were not found for young children. Based on these findings, we recommend that evaluations of highway safety policies focusing on a specific age group within a single state not be limited to analyses of traffic fatalities alone. Studies employing analyses of the larger numbers of crash-induced injuries have identified modest but important casualty reductions not found when analyzing fatalities alone.\r"

Initial results show that seat belts reduce the risk of serious injury to the driver by 58% and fatal injury by 73%. For right front passengers, the comparable figures are 53% and 66%. When a measure of vehicle deformity reflecting the severity of the crash is introduced as a control variable, these effectiveness values decline somewhat. Depending on the specific approach taken, seat belts are shown to reduce the risk of serious injury to passenger car drivers by 51-52%, and the risk of fatal injury by 63-67%. For right front passengers, the effectiveness ranges are 43-44% for serious injury and 53-55% for fatal injury. While these adjusted estimates of belt effectiveness are lower than those based on the raw data, they nevertheless represent considerable benefit to car occupants using seat belts.\r"

By effectiveness is meant the reduction, expressed as per cent, in fatalities to a presently unbelted population that would result if all of its members were to use belts, but not otherwise change their driving behavior. The double-pair comparison method is presented more simply, with less mathematical detail and rigor, than in earlier descriptions of it. The method is applied to determine the effectiveness of three-point lap/shoulder belts in preventing fatalities to drivers and right front passengers in passenger cars of model year 1974 or later, averaged over the distribution of crashes which occur in U.S. traffic. The method is then applied to investigate the dependence of effectiveness on a variety of vehicular, accident, roadway, and environmental factors. It is reported that if all presently unbelted drivers and right front passengers were to use the provided lap/shoulder belts, but not otherwise change their behavior, fatalities to this group would decline by (43 +/- 3)%. Safety belt effectiveness for drivers is higher in single-car crashes than in multiple-vehicle crashes, but does not depend much on a variety of other vehicle factors (for example, car size), accident factors (travel speed), roadway factors (posted speed limit), and environmental factors (light versus dark).\r"

Of the belted occupants who were seriously injured or killed, it appears that their injuries were due to improper placement of the seat belts on the anatomy.

Changes in other categories of casualties were within normal statistical limits and were uninfluenced by the seat belt legislation.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-eight consecutive patients with chronic refractory osteomyelitis uncomplicated by persistent fracture nonunion, septic arthritis, total joint arthroplasty, or major systemic disease (immune deficiency, malignancy, malnutrition, renal or hepatic failure) were treated from January 1980 through December 1985 to evaluate the potential benefits of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. Patients were classified by a staging system taking into account: the bone involved; subchondral, periarticular bone involvement; extent of bone involvement; quality of soft-tissue envelope and vascular supply; and general health status of the patient. Using this staging system patients were assigned to either hyperbaric oxygen therapy or control status after their initial debridement. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy on a 100% oxygen, 2 atmospheres pressure, 2-hour duration, one dive per day, six dives per week regimen was utilized in 14 of the 28 patients. Hyperbaric oxygen had no effect on length of hospitalization, rapidity of wound repair, initial clinical outcome, or recurrence of infection noted to date.\r"

  ".W": "The activities of a trauma service in a university hospital were analyzed to test the hypothesis that operative caseload alone does not adequately measure the trauma experience of a surgical resident. Over a 2-year period, 378 victims of major trauma (blunt in 79%) were admitted to the service. Only 41% of them required a major operation by the Trauma Service. The patients spent an average of 2.8 days in the intensive care unit and often presented complex challenges in surgical critical care, including ventilator support and hemodynamic monitoring. A trauma service in a university center manages significant numbers of patients with multisystem injuries who never undergo a general surgical procedure. This experience constitutes such an important component of surgical education in trauma that it should be recognized by agencies accrediting residents and training programs. Completion of surgical residency should also imply competence in critical care of surgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical wound infections following traumatic injury remain a source of morbidity and mortality. A simple system for estimating the risk of infectious complications was evaluated in 949 trauma patients requiring operative therapy. The majority of cases were caused by penetrating trauma (784). Truncal, neck, and extremity procedures were included. The overall wound infection rate was 7%. Infection rates were related to amount of bacterial contamination and mechanism of injury. Age, type of antibiotics, and delay time from injury to operation were not risk factors for any injury type. Wound classification, shock, blood loss, number of organs injured, and operative time were significant risk factors, but had different effects on infection rate related to injury type. Multivariate analysis revealed no significant infectious risk factors for stabwounds. Significant factors were wound class (p = 0.02) and shock (p = 0.001) for gunshot wounds, wound class (p = 0.03) and number of organs injured (p = 0.01) for blunt trauma, and blood loss (p = 0.01) for shotgun wounds. This classification system can be used to review outcome and compare trauma patient populations for infectious morbidity in a more uniform fashion.\r"

  ".U": "87283998\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to investigate pressure changes and possible damage to the central and peripheral nervous system induced by a high-energy missile striking a peripheral extremity. Anesthetized pigs were shot with a high-velocity missile (1,500 ms-1) in their left thigh. Transducers placed in the abdomen and brain recorded short-lasting bursts (1.0 to 1.5 ms) of oscillating pressure waves of high frequency. The amplitude of the pressure waves within the brain was about 125 KPa, and in the abdomen about 270 KPa, with a mean value of transferred energy from the missile of about 700 joules. Concomitantly, there were one or two apneic periods with a duration of a few seconds during the first minute after the shot. No significant changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, or other circulatory parameters were detected. Minor blood-brain and blood-nerve barrier damage occurred. It is concluded that the pressure waves caused by hits of peripheral parts of the body by high-energy missiles may be of such a large magnitude that distant damage to nervous tissue may result.\r"
