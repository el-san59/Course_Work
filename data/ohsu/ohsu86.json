Improved features of the forceps include a positive-action closure, barrel design, and lightly serrated surfaces. Rotational movements are made easier by this modified forceps design. Over the past three years, 96 cases of premacular fibroplasia have been successfully managed with the modified forceps. Delicate membranes have been removed without tearing or shredding.\r"

Ten (43%) of these suspected melanomas provided useful images on both spin-lattice (T1)- and spin-spin (T2)-weighted studies and these had characteristic features. The features include a high-intensity image on T1-weighted studies with progressively decreasing relative intensity on T2-weighted images. These findings are consistent with short T1 and T2 relaxation times. In contrast, three cases of carcinoma metastatic to the choroid demonstrated a relatively high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The short relaxation times exhibited by uveal melanomas are in contrast with the relatively long T1 and T2 times found in other malignant neoplasms. These characteristics may provide a noninvasive method for differentiation of malignant melanoma from other mass lesions within the uveal tract.\r"

The summed amplitudes of the oscillatory potentials were significantly lower in diabetic compared with control subjects, and the amplitudes decreased progressively as the retinopathy severity increased. Among diabetic patients, a significant correlation was found between the oscillatory potentials and the other visual function tests; lower amplitudes were associated with lower visual field and visual acuity scores and higher Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue error scores. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the most important predictors of oscillatory potential amplitudes were retinopathy level, fluorescein leakage, and age; capillary nonperfusion did not add to the predictive power of the model when fluorescein leakage was included.\r"

However, ERG components obtained from patients with peripheral retinal neovascularization were reduced in amplitude compared with those obtained from normal subjects or patients without neovascularization. The reduced a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potential amplitudes may have been due to photoreceptor dysfunction secondary to choroidal ischemia or possibly increased oxygen demands by the inner retina. Ischemia of the inner retina may also have contributed to the altered b-wave and oscillatory potentials. These results suggest that ERG provides a means of assessing the consequence of peripheral retinal ischemia to retinal cell function and could be of value in monitoring patients with sickle cell disease for the development of clinically significant peripheral retinal neovascularization.\r"

These patients had final visual acuities of 20/200 or less following conventional amblyopia therapy. In contrast, five patients had myopia with a mean of -3.75 diopters of anisometropia and normal maculae. These patients had final visual acuities of 20/30 or greater with identical therapy. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean diopters of anisometropia of these two groups. However, the range of diopters of anisometropia overlapped, and the critical feature that determined which patients could achieve good vision was the macular appearance. This condition is distinct from simple unilateral myopia with amblyopia and from myelinated nerve fibers without myopia or amblyopia.\r"

Histopathologic evaluation of corneal tissue obtained from one patient at the time of edetic acid chelation revealed histochemical findings consistent with anterior stromal calcification. To investigate a possible relationship between Viscoat and the rapid onset of band keratopathy, Viscoat formulated with varying concentrations of phosphate buffer was injected intracamerally into 42 rabbit eyes. Within 48 hours, clinically obvious corneal opacification developed in nine (47%) of 19 eyes injected with the commercial preparation of Viscoat. Also, similar opacification developed in ten (77%) of 13 eyes that received Viscoat formulated with twice the phosphate concentration of the commercial preparation. Band keratopathy did not develop any of ten eyes that received Viscoat with one fourth the commercial phosphate concentration. In selected opacified corneas, the presence of phosphorus in the subepithelial and posterior corneal stroma was confirmed by histochemical stains and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.\r"

The presence of anemia in the very high ESR group compared with the low ESR group was the only statistically identified difference. A linear regression analysis confirmed a high degree of inverse correlation between ESR and hematocrit in the subject population. There was no difference in ischemic ocular complications among the three groups. These findings emphasize that the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis should be made predominantly on clinical suspicion with less reliance on the ESR as a diagnostic criterion. Furthermore, the degree of ESR elevation does not predict which patients are at increased risk for the development of ocular complications. Finally, the ESR may not reliably indicate active disease in patients with normal hematocrit values.\r"

Thus, by means of the new technique, we avoided the formation of additional neovascularization and lipid deposition. Vascular occlusion by photothrombosis, effected with 8.5 times less incident intensity and 27.5 times less total light exposure than with photocoagulation, yielded an average reduction of corneal cholesterol content of 36% as opposed to an increase of 24% found with previous argon laser photocoagulation.\r"

While the patients with syphilis and the heroin addicts had elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies in their circulation, no reactivity with DNA was observed in these sera. Sera from systemic lupus erythematosus patients often showed both anti-DNA and anticardiolipin activity. Although a correlation between anti-DNA and anticardiolipin titers was found, this did not always result from cross-reactivity of the same population of antibodies. In fact, we observed a relationship between cross-reactivity and antibody avidity. Anti-DNA of high avidity to DNA showed little cross-reactivity with cardiolipin. Anticardiolipin activity in such sera was based on the presence of specific anticardiolipin antibodies. Anti-DNA of low avidity was found to cross-react with cardiolipin. Among monoclonal antibodies to DNA, we found that cross-reactions with cardiolipin were rare: only 6 of 55 anti-DNA clones produced antibodies that also reacted with cardiolipin.\r"

This distortion was found less frequently in class II and class I patients (3 patients), and the difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.005, class III versus class I and class II). No correlation was found between the vertebral dislocation (measured in millimeters) on plain radiographs and the presence of cord distortion on MRI. Myelography in class III patients showed that passage of contrast medium was blocked at the same level as the cord distortion seen on MRI. These findings suggest that MRI can serve as a useful, noninvasive procedure in the diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis patients in whom compressive cervical myelopathy is suspected.\r"

The ADL pain scale met psychometric criteria for validity and reliability. Scores on the 2 pain scales were correlated significantly with one another and with other measures of disease status, including joint count, grip strength, walking time, button test, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, global self-assessment, ADL difficulty, and ADL dissatisfaction scales. Correlations of ADL pain scale scores with other measures were higher than were correlations of visual analog scale scores with other measures, in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Significantly more patients completed the ADL pain scale without assistance than the number of those who completed the visual analog pain scale. The ADL pain scale was more sensitive to problems in ADL than were the ADL scales for difficulty and dissatisfaction. The ADL and visual analog pain scales appear to provide useful data for quantitative assessment of pain in the routine care of rheumatoid arthritis patients.\r"

There did not appear to be any consensus regarding what constitutes a routine synovial fluid analysis. Technical errors occurred, including dilution with acetic acid for cell counts and inappropriate use of automated cell counters. Twenty-six laboratories studied 4 \"unknown\" fluids for crystals. In 50 opportunities to detect each crystal type, calcium pyrophosphate was detected only 6 times, and sodium urate was detected 39 times. The white blood cell count reported for a single fluid ranged from 2,467-12,000/mm3 (mean +/- SD 6,683 +/- 1,992). The proportion of neutrophils identified varied from 0-30% (mean +/- SD 13.8 +/- 8.6). The majority of respondents believed that training and reference materials related to synovial fluid analysis should be improved.\r"

We performed forearm ischemic tests on 3 patients with histochemically defined MADA deficiency and 13 healthy control subjects, in a standardized fashion. Our results demonstrated that subject effort and/or performance during the exercise portion of testing is a critical variable. In addition to lactate and ammonia, plasma purine compounds (adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine) were measured. The finding of decreased purine release after exercise in MADA-deficient patients compared with that in normal individuals increases the specificity of the test and supports the hypothesis that disordered purine metabolism occurs in MADA deficiency.\r"

Absorption of 4-B-5 with peripheral blood mononuclear cells or with mouse thymocytes markedly reduced reactivity with both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA. However, treatment of mouse thymocytes or human T cells with DNase completely eliminated monoclonal anti-DNA reactivity with cells. The cellular reactivity was completely restored when monoclonal anti-DNA was incubated with DNase-treated cells in the presence of normal human serum. Normal human serum was found to contain 574 +/- 639 ng/ml of ssDNA. Coincubation or cell preincubation of mouse thymocytes with ssDNA produced a marked increase in 4-B-5 cell association. These findings indicate that mouse monoclonal anti-DNA can react with and can penetrate both mouse and human mononuclear cells, and that this reactivity may depend on the presence of cell membrane DNA on both types of target cells.\r"

In contrast, sera from 10 patients with hydralazine-induced lupus bound a broader array of individual histones and recognized a different set of histone epitopes. We conclude that these 2 drugs induce antihistone antibodies through somewhat different mechanisms, which possibly involve differences in their ability to structurally alter chromatin.\r"

A variety of tests have been developed, three of which are used widely; these are the Margaria step test, the Wingate cycle ergometer test, and the 50-yd dash. Estimates of anaerobic power requiring a minimal amount of equipment can be obtained using field tests such as the 50-yd dash. More quantitative measurements can be made using the Margaria step test or the Wingate cycle ergometer test. Whereas these tests have identifiable limitations, they are relatively easy to administer and require only a minimum of equipment. Because maximal anaerobic power is a kind of work important in many common sports activities, the measurement of anaerobic power should be considered with other routine assessments for optimizing performance.\r"

Analysis by light microscopy as well as transmission and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated intimal hyperplasia, which was more prominent in nonpatent grafts.

It can be prepared quickly without sophisticated equipment or expense. Autologous glue obviates the risk of transmissible disease that has precluded approval of the commercial product for use in the United States. The glued anastomosis can be performed with accurate apposition and minimal trauma to the nerve. By making a fibrin cocoon, the anastomosis can be insulated. This provides some of the benefits of sheathed anastomosis while minimizing foreign body reaction. Functional evaluation and histologic results comparing the amount of anastomotic fibrosis, axonal regeneration, and alignment of fascicles showed glue to be as good as, if not superior to, conventional suture technique.\r"

A retrospective analysis compared patients who received an antipseudomonal cephalosporin as monotherapy (group A) with those who received conventional antipseudomonal therapy (group B). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in all patients. Differences (group B less than group A) included insulin dependence, underlying vascular disease, total number of cranial nerve palsies or paresis, and surgical procedures. The overall clinical outcome was similar in both groups; 64% of patients in group A (7/11) and 70% in group B (7/10) were cured at a follow-up period of five to 57 months. A more favorable outcome was found in patients with less extensive infection in both groups. Monotherapy compared favorably with conventional antipseudomonal therapy for the treatment of patients with MEO and moderate infection.\r"

We encountered a case of osteomyelitis of the cervical spine occurring subsequent to an otherwise uncomplicated tonsillectomy. Although never previously reported with tonsillectomy to our knowledge, cervical osteomyelitis has been associated with other procedures and infections of the head, neck, and maxillofacial regions. Mechanisms that might explain this occurrence include direct extension via fascial planes, direct venous and lymphatic spread, and hematogenous dissemination from the contaminated surgical site. Treatment consisted of drainage and debridement of the infection, cervical immobilization, and long-term antibiotic administration. Healing was complete and cervical mobility and stability were normal at three months. Early recognition of this unusual complication of tonsillectomy is imperative to avoid potential neurologic sequelae.\r"

Using life-table methods, this study has identified the association of diabetic glomerulosclerosis with age over 60 or under 20 years as factors jointly relevant in predicting peritonitis, hospitalization, or death. In addition, these outcomes were more likely to occur if patients were black and had been exposed to other dialytic therapy earlier on. The latter two were the only factors jointly predictive of transfer from CAPD onto hemodialysis. Careful monitoring of patients with the above mentioned characteristics may reduce complications, and lead to greater success with this increasingly popular dialysis modality.\r"

Trimeprazine syrup was found to increase the pH of the gastric contents, and decrease the likelihood of the pulmonary aspiration syndrome. There was a significant increase in gastric volume in patients premedicated with temazepam elixir which did not occur in patients given temazepam capsules. These results support the custom of fasting patients for at least 4 h before anaesthesia and indicate that oral premedicants and their vehicles can have significant effects on the stomach.\r"

The distribution of spectral EEG indices of the baseline EEG, during the intraoperative and recovery periods were established and compared. Median frequency exhibited the most clear separation between the distributions during recovery and the intraoperative period. During anaesthesia, the median values were found to be lower than 5 Hz; when the patient was conscious, the EEG median frequency values were greater than 6 Hz. Time to recovery was 13.4 +/- 2.9 min and 30.0 +/- 8.5 min for the groups treated with 1.3 and 1.5 MAC, respectively. Burst suppression was observed during the loading period in all patients treated with 1.5 MAC and in five patients out of seven receiving 1.3 MAC. The average duration of the period of burst suppression was markedly greater in the group receiving 1.5 MAC than in the group receiving 1.3 MAC.

Overt cellular damage was assessed biochemically by measurement of lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide-induced haemolysis and osmotic fragility. Pathological changes were assessed by light and electron microscopy. Up to 11 days exposure of rats to 80% oxygen was not lethal, but resulted in overt cellular damage to red blood cells (haemoglobin concentration decreased from 13.8 +/- 1.4 (SD) g dl-1 to 12.4 +/- 0.5 g dl-1; hydrogen peroxide-induced haemolysis increased from 7.7 +/- 1.6% to 75.1 +/- 13.5% after 11 days of hyperoxia) and to cells of lung (4-fold increase in lipid peroxidation) as well as a biochemical adaptation to the increased concentration of oxygen metabolites (superoxide dismutase increased 3-fold, catalase 5-fold and glutathione peroxidase 2-fold).

  ".W": "The effects of disopyramide were studied at the neuromuscular junction in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of its blocking action at this site. Disopyramide 5 X 10(-5) - 10(-3) mol litre-1 produced a concentration-dependent reduction of twitch amplitude in the indirectly stimulated chick biventer cervicis preparation, but greater concentrations were required to reduce twitches elicited directly in the presence of erabutoxin-b 1 microgram ml-1. Equieffective twitch blocking doses of either disopyramide or tubocurarine greatly reduced agonist responses to acetylcholine and carbachol, but the reduction was less for magnesium-blocked twitches. Neostigmine antagonized tubocurarine-induced, but not disopyramide-induced, blockade of twitches. Concentration-response profiles to acetylcholine and carbachol were shifted to the right in a non-parallel fashion and the maximal response was depressed by disopyramide 5 X 10(-5) - 10(-4) mol litre-1. Intracellular recording studies carried out in the cut, voltage-clamped costo-cutaneous muscle of the garter snake showed that disopyramide 5 X 10(-5) - 5 X 10(-4) mol litre-1 produced a concentration- and voltage-dependent reduction of the amplitude of neurally evoked endplate-currents (EPC) and of the time constant of decay (tau) of EPC. We conclude that disopyramide possesses a non-competitive blocking action at the neuromuscular junction, which is not reversible by anticholinesterase agents. The voltage-dependent nature of the block suggests that it is mediated via blockade of the open form of the acetylcholine-activated receptor-ion channel complex.\r"

Neostigmine augmented the response: a maximum augmentation occurred at a concentration of 6.4 X 10(-7) mol litre-1. At greater concentrations of neostigmine the response was reduced. Adrenaline in the absence of neostigmine produced no significant change in the contraction response. However, in the presence of neostigmine further augmentation occurred and achieved a maximum in the presence of adrenaline 3.2 X 10(-7)-1.3 X 10(-6) mol litre-1. Adrenaline 4.0 X 10(-8)-1.3 X 10(-6) mol litre-1 combined with neostigmine 4.0 X 10(-8)-6.4 X 10(-7) mol litre-1 reversed tubocurarine-induced neuromuscular blockade more effectively than neostigmine alone (P less than 0.001). Adrenaline appeared to enhance the antagonistic effect of neostigmine by increasing acetylcholine release and by enhancing the response at the post-junctional acetylcholine receptor.\r"

  ".W": "A nationwide follow-up survey was undertaken to study the use of extradural and intrathecal opioids in the management of pain, to estimate the incidence of delayed ventilatory depression and to study post-injection surveillance routines. A questionnaire was sent to all 93 anaesthetic departments in Sweden; 96% responded. The major indication for using extradural opioids was the treatment of postoperative, traumatic and cancer pain. During 1984 over 14,000 patients received extradural, and over 1100 patients intrathecal, opioids. Morphine was the predominant opioid for extradural administration and was used in 96% of patients. Extradural opioid analgesia constitutes about 25% of all extradural blocks performed in Sweden. Pruritus and urinary retention were considered as minor problems; however, the risk was considerably higher after intrathecal morphine. The incidence of delayed ventilatory depression was about 1:1100 (0.09%) following extradural morphine and 1:275 (0.36%) following intrathecal morphine. Risk factors for delayed ventilatory depression are discussed. Administration of extradural morphine for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing major surgery is considered a high benefit-low risk technique by most Swedish anaesthetists. The results of the present nationwide survey suggests that, following extradural morphine, surveillance of patients for more than 12 h appears unnecessary.\r"

  ".U": "87272039\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous investigators have postulated that a hypercoagulable state exists in humans for a period of time before the development of thrombotic episodes. A clear biochemical definition of the prethrombotic state, however, has proved elusive due in part to the lack of reliable techniques for monitoring pertinent changes in blood coagulability. Based on recent advances in our knowledge of the biochemistry of the coagulation system, a series of highly sensitive and specific immunochemical tools has been developed that can quantitate the activities of various steps of the hemostatic mechanism in vivo at the subnanomolar level. We have established assays for F1+2 and the protein C activation peptide, which measure the cleavage of the prothrombin molecule by factor Xa and the scission of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, respectively. Nossel and coworkers had previously constructed similar assays for fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and fragment B beta 1-42, which monitor the cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin and the proteolysis of fibrin I by plasmin, respectively. Substantial elevations in the levels of these markers have been found in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and many subjects with acute deep venous thrombosis. The F1+2 and FPA assays have been used to demonstrate that significant increments in factor Xa activity but not thrombin activity regularly occur in the blood of nonanticoagulated individuals with congenital deficiencies of antithrombin or protein C. These two disorders are known to be correlated with the subsequent development of thrombosis. Patients with protein C deficiency have also been noted to have significantly reduced plasma levels of protein C activation peptide. By using the immunoassays for FPA and B beta 1-42 in studies of postoperative patients, it has been shown that an imbalance between the procoagulant action of thrombin and the anticoagulant effect of plasmin on fibrin I polymer may induce an acquired thrombotic diathesis. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that prothrombin activation as measured by the F1+2 assay is suppressed by oral anticoagulants in the blood of patients with thrombotic diatheses. These investigations suggest that these assay techniques can be used to improve our understanding of the hypercoagulable state as well as to develop more effective treatment strategies for the prevention of thromboembolic events.\r"

Incubation of human PMN with influenza A virus in vitro for 30 minutes significantly decreased PMN migration under agarose in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or zymosan-activated serum. Virus-treated PMN tended to aggregate in the under-agarose assay. Aggregation was avoided by using a more dilute PMN suspension in filter assays. Virus treatment significantly decreased migration through 100-micron thick cellulose nitrate filters but had no effect on migration through 10-micron thick polycarbonate filters or on PMN bipolar shape change. Virus was not chemotactic in the polycarbonate filter assay and did not induce shape change in purified PMN. It was concluded that influenza virus did not interfere with the ability of PMN to recognize a chemoattractant, undergo shape change, and move a short distance but did limit the extent of migration. Inhibition could not be explained by chemotactic deactivation, since the virus was not chemotactic.\r"

Normal human eosinophils were found to respond to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) at concentrations greater than 10(-7) mol/L with an increase in the concentration of intracellular free calcium, oxygen consumption, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and chemiluminescence. The maximal response of eosinophils to fMLP was lower than that of neutrophils isolated from the same blood samples and required at least ten times as much fMLP as was needed for neutrophils. Low fMLP concentrations (approximately 10(-8) mol/L), which in themselves did not stimulate O2 consumption by either eosinophils or neutrophils, primed these cells to respond to a suboptimal concentration of another stimulus. Purification of eosinophils after treatment of whole blood with fMLP showed that these eosinophils had lost their ability to respond to fMLP. We conclude that normal eosinophils do respond to fMLP and that therefore fMLP should not be used to isolate eosinophils.\r"

B19 inoculation in vitro resulted in a marked decline in identifiable erythroid cells over seven to nine days of incubation. Characteristic giant early erythroid cells were seen on Wright's-Giemsa stain of infected cultures. By in situ hybridization, 30% to 40% of erythroblasts were infected at 48 hours; a similar proportion of cells showed B19 capsid protein by immunofluorescence. B19 DNA was present in erythroblasts but not in the leukocyte fraction of bone marrow. B19 replication, as determined by Southern analysis, and B19 encapsidation, as determined by sensitivity of isolated cell fractions to DNase I, were restricted to the nuclei. B19 DNA was detectable in the nuclei from infected cultures beginning at 18 hours and in the supernatant at 32 hours; B19 genome copy number was estimated at about 25,000 to 30,000/infected cell at 48 hours. Recovery of virus depended on the multiplicity of infection (moi); at low moi, approximately 200x input virus was recovered from total cultures and 50x from the culture supernatants. Virus released into the supernatant was as infectious or more infectious than virus obtained from sera of infected patients. Human erythroid bone marrow culture represents a safe in vitro system for the elucidation of the cellular and molecular biology of the pathogenic B19 parvovirus.\r"

Recently, an increasing incidence of thrombocytopenia has been observed in homosexual men, but whether Fc receptor-mediated clearance of antibody-coated cells is normal or impaired in these men is unknown. To study this question, we measured the in vivo clearance of anti-Rho(D) IgG antibody-sensitized 51Cr-labeled autologous red cells in five homosexual men with thrombocytopenia without an evident cause. All five had antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, and four had circulating immune complexes as determined by a Clq-binding assay. Two of the men tested also had an increase in platelet-associated IgG. In the four homosexual men with platelet counts of 20,000/microL or less, the clearance half-time of IgG-sensitized red cells was prolonged (mean, 106 minutes; range, 72 to 140 minutes) as compared with the clearance of such cells in five hematologically normal men (mean, 39 minutes; range 30 to 50 minutes; P less than .005). One homosexual man with a platelet count of 81,000/microL had a normal clearance half-time (30 minutes). Three patients whose platelet counts increased after corticosteroid therapy were restudied. In all three, the clearance of antibody-coated cells was shortened and returned to normal in the one patient who had achieved a complete remission. No correlation was observed between the presence of platelet-associated IgG or circulating immune complexes and the clearance half-time. These data indicate that severe thrombocytopenia occurring in homosexual men as in some patients with classic ITP is associated with defective in vivo Fc receptor-mediated clearance of antibody-coated cells.\r"

The changes were not seen in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (0 of 9). The abnormal methylation patterns appear to be a property only of transformed or malignant cells since they were not found in DNA from nonneoplastic adult tissues including sperm, early myeloid progenitor cells, benign lymphoid hyperplasia, peripheral lymphocytes stimulated to divide, or early myeloid progenitor cells (obtained by immunoaffinity using anti-My-10 antibody), but they did appear after Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes. Moreover, during the course of therapy in patients with ANLL, the hypermethylation pattern reflects the presence of the leukemic clone even in normal-appearing granulocytes derived from this clone. The increased methylation of the CT gene may then provide an important molecular marker for biologic events in human cell transformation or tumor progression and may prove clinically useful in monitoring patients with lymphoid and acute myelogenous neoplasms.\r"

Thrombocytopenia was immune mediated since the patient's platelets bore high levels of antiplatelet antibody. Radioimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the autoantibodies had specificity for platelet glycoproteins Ib and V as well as platelet HLA. The patient's plasma as well as purified immunoglobulin G completely inhibited the ristocetin-induced aggregation of normal platelets but did not inhibit adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation.

Two hybridomas yielded approximately 2 and approximately 7.5 mg/mL of IgG2a kappa and IgM kappa, respectively. Monoclonal surface immunoglobulin-bearing cells of all B-CLL patients studied (n = 30) reacted with the MoAbs (r greater than .99) regardless of stage or lymphocyte count. This suggests that the malignant clone in CLL can be identified and its size monitored by using our MoAbs. In contrast, normal B lymphocytes, a large panel of normal, reactive and neoplastic cells, and malignant cell lines failed to react with either MoAb as judged by indirect immunofluorescence and by flow cytometry. Only two patients (one with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the other with acute myeloblastic leukemia) exhibited a small cell subset reactive with the MoAbs. cCLLa specificity was suggested by selective target cell reactivity and competitive inhibition-absorption and confirmed by immunoprecipitation. MoAbs IgG2a kappa and IgM kappa appeared to share antigenic determinants and were moderate and avid complement binders inducing 100% and 40% target cell lysis, respectively. cCLLa density on malignant CLL and HCL cells was estimated by equilibrium binding studies using the IgG2a kappa MoAb at 1.7 and 9 X 10(6)/cell, respectively. The restricted expression of the cCLLa and the specificity and cytolytic activity of the anti-cCLLa MoAbs support these antibodies as probes for the classification of lymphoproliferative diseases and for the specific diagnosis and treatment of B-CLL and its variants.\r"

These included seven cases that had histological evidence of transformation from a lower grade and 11 that lacked such evidence. The most common of the additional changes seen in both groups affected chromosomes 6 and 7 and comprised the loss of chromosome 6 or del(6q) and the presence of more than two copies of chromosome 7 or duplication of 7q. Changes affecting these two chromosomes were less frequent in low-grade lymphomas with t(14;18) as well as in lymphomas lacking the translocation. These data suggest that common cytogenetic mechanisms underlie expression of high-grade histologies by lymphomas carrying t(14;18). In addition, they may serve as indicators of transformation when encountered in low-grade lymphomas with t(14;18).\r"

  ".W": "Ca2+-ionophore A23187-induced synthesis of the alkoxyether lipid platelet activating factor (PAF) by leukocytes from Zellweger patients was undetectable in two patients studied at 3 and 4 weeks of age, reduced in a third patient studied at 2 months of age, and in the low normal range in four patients studied between 4 months and 5 years of age. We have previously reported that plasmalogen-type phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels of erythrocytes are reduced in Zellweger patients up to 20 weeks of age, but normal in older patients. These levels were reduced in the three patients with abnormal PAF synthesis, and normal in the other four patients. The results suggest a close relationship between the age of the patients at sampling, and both the A23187-induced capacity of leukocytes to synthesize PAF and the plasmalogen PE levels in their erythrocytes.\r"

After transformation, cloned cell lines were developed that even after rigorous subcloning invariably produced both stromal cells and round cells. The stromal cells expressed cytoskeletal filaments similar to those of long-term marrow culture adherent cells and produced interstitial and basal lamina collagen types. The round cells had the electron microscopic appearance of primitive hematopoietic cells and when examined with cytochemical stains and monoclonal antibodies to hematopoietic differentiation antigens had reaction patterns suggestive of cells from several lineages. Most round cells expressed the pan-hematopoietic T-200 determinant, and lesser percentages expressed the early T cell antigens CD-1 and CD-3, HLA-DR determinants, the monocytic antigen recognized by Leu M3, and the myeloid antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies 1G10 and 12.8. In addition, when plated in semisolid medium in the presence of a source of colony-stimulating activity, up to 11% of the cells formed colonies consisting of blastlike cells that also expressed hematopoietic cell surface determinants. The data suggest that adherent cells in long-term marrow cultures contain a cell that after transformation by SV40 obligately produces cells with hematopoietic as well as stromalike features.\r"

An increased binding of two- to threefold occurred after stimulation with thrombin or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), with slight but significant increase in the dissociation constants (Kd) of two antibodies (LJ-CP8 and LJ-P9). In contrast, no statistically significant changes were observed with ADP-stimulated platelets. The increased binding of LJ-CP3, but not of the other two antibodies, to activated platelets decreased by 30% to 40% in the presence of EDTA at 22 to 25 degrees C. Platelets stimulated by thrombin or PMA bound more fibrinogen than did those stimulated by ADP, and significant differences in the extent but not in the affinity of fibrinogen binding were observed with various platelet agonists. When the pool of GP IIb/IIIa molecules exposed on the surface of unstimulated platelets was reacted with the monoclonal antibody LJ-CP3 to block ADP-induced fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation, stimulation with thrombin or PMA still induced substantial binding of antibody and fibrinogen, and aggregation ensued. Therefore, platelets exposed to \"strong\" agonists exhibit an increased number of surface-oriented epitopes associated with GP IIb/IIIa. The GP IIb/IIIa molecules bearing these newly exposed epitopes are functional in that they can bind fibrinogen and mediate platelet aggregation.\r"

The concentration of HTF1-7B8 producing half-maximal inhibition is influenced by the concentration of factor VIIa, suggesting that the antibody and enzyme compete for the cofactor. The antibody was successfully used to detect both human and bovine tissue factor on nitrocellulose dot blots, indicating that the epitope recognized by this antibody is conserved in both species. This antibody clearly reveals tissue factor on a Western blot. An HTF1-7B8 affinity column was used to purify tissue factor from both human brain and placenta. The electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the amino acid compositions of the purified tissue factor from brain and placenta are indistinguishable, as are their specific procoagulant activities in reconstituted systems. This antibody will be useful for immunopurification and characterization of tissue factor structure and mechanism.\r"

Phosphorylation of 20- and 47-kiloDalton (kD) proteins was analyzed during the first 5 seconds of platelet response to ADP from 0.5 to 10.0 mumol/L and compared with the progress of aggregation. The onset time for aggregation and phosphorylation of both proteins was less than 1 second; 20-K phosphorylation was increased greater than 200% and 47-K phosphorylation was increased 50%. The ADP sensitivity of 20-K phosphorylation was greater than that of 47-K phosphorylation (P less than .025), and of that of aggregation (P less than .01), with Ka values of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 mumol/L of ADP, respectively. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect on aggregation, but inhibited both phosphorylations. Its inhibition of 20-K phosphorylation was greater than that of 47-K phosphorylation. Platelet activation by ADP thus induced biochemical changes well before 1 second. The quenched-flow approach may help to reveal relationships between phospholipase activation, calcium fluxes, and protein phosphorylation during these early periods of platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "Human blood depolymerizes filamentous (F-)actin. The interaction of actin filaments and monomers with human serum was studied by following the kinetics and extent of the depolymerization of pyrene-labeled F-actin and by analysis of serum proteins adhering to immobilized actin monomers. In physiologic Ca2+ concentrations, the depolymerization of F-actin proceeds in two stages: a rapid phase, attributed to direct severing of filaments by plasma gelsolin, and a slow phase attributed to the binding of actin monomers to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). Without Ca2+, only the slow phase is observed. Human serum can completely depolymerize 10 to 18 mumol/L of actin, of which approximately 5 mumol/L occurs rapidly. Depolymerization can be accounted for by the normal serum concentrations of gelsolin and DBP. Fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin, which bind actin in vitro, do not contribute to the kinetics or extent of its depolymerization. Affinity chromatography and functional assays for the presence of gelsolin-actin complexes show that addition of G-actin to serum results in preferential formation of actin-DBP complexes, but that addition of F-actin to serum produces both gelsolin-actin complexes and DBP-actin complexes. The distinctive binding of actin monomers and polymers to these two serum proteins suggests a means by which their coordinated actions are maximized in vivo, from the standpoint of depolymerizing filaments and clearing monomers from the circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of human platelets, human neutrophils, or highly metastatic mouse lymphoma cells with sulfate-labeled extracellular matrix (ECM) results in heparanase-mediated release of labeled heparan sulfate cleavage fragments (0.5 less than Kav less than 0.85 on Sepharose 6B). This degradation was inhibited by native heparin both when brought about by intact cells or their released heparanase activity. Degradation of heparan sulfate in ECM may facilitate invasion of normal and malignant cells through basement membranes. The present study tested the heparanase inhibitory effect of nonanticoagulant species of heparin that might be of potential use in preventing heparanase mediated extravasation of bloodborne cells. For this purpose, we prepared various species of low-sulfated or low-mol-wt heparins, all of which exhibited less than 7% of the anticoagulant activity of native heparin. N-sulfate groups of heparin are necessary for its heparanase inhibitory activity but can be substituted by an acetyl group provided that the O-sulfate groups are retained. O-sulfate groups could be removed provided that the N positions were resulfated. Total desulfation of heparin abolished its heparanase inhibitory activity. Heparan sulfate was a 25-fold less potent heparanase inhibitor than native heparin. Efficiency of low-mol-wt heparins to inhibit degradation of heparan sulfate in ECM decreased with their main molecular size, and a synthetic pentasaccharide, representing the binding site to antithrombin III, was devoid of inhibitory activity. Similar results were obtained with heparanase activities released from platelets, neutrophils, and lymphoma cells. We propose that heparanase inhibiting nonanticoagulant heparins may interfere with dissemination of bloodborne tumor cells and development of experimental autoimmune diseases.\r"

  ".U": "87272074\r", 
  ".W": "Fibrinogen Paris I contains a mutant gamma chain that is longer than the normal chain, resulting in altered fibrin polymerization and cross-linking. Because these functions involve the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain, we decided to determine whether fibrinogen Paris I or the isolated Paris I gamma chain supports normal ADP-induced platelet aggregation, a function that requires the ultimate 12 residues of the normal gamma chain (400 through 411). Aggregation of ADP-stimulated normal platelets was defective with fibrinogen Paris I and markedly depressed with the gamma Paris I chain. These findings prompted us to characterize the carboxy-terminal structure of the region of the gamma Paris I chain responsible for this activity. The carboxy-terminal cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptide of the normal gamma chain (385 through 411) or that from gamma Paris I was isolated by differential adsorption to triethylene-tetramine resin or by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The CNBr peptide from the Paris I gamma chain was identical to that of the normal gamma chain in its retention time on HPLC, its amino acid composition, and its sequence. Thus, the primary structure of the gamma Paris I chain from residue 384 through 411 is normal, indicating that a peptide insertion has occurred upstream from residue 384, resulting in an impairment of those physiologic functions attributable to the carboxy-terminal end of the gamma chain from position 384 (ie, cross-linking, ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and at least a portion of the gamma chain polymerization site). These observations demonstrate that the gamma chain platelet recognition site in the fibrinogen molecule is necessary but not alone sufficient to support normal ADP-induced platelet aggregation. There appears to be an additional requirement for normal conformation of the gamma chain or availability of its terminal sequence during the interaction of fibrinogen with platelets.\r"

Leukemic myeloblasts from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured in soft agar in the continuous presence of 10(-5) to 5 X 10(-5) mol/L of Ara-C together with dCyd (10(-4) to 5 X 10(-3) mol/L). Administration of 10(-5) mol/L of Ara-C alone eradicated colony formation in all samples tested. Coadministration of 10(-3) mol/L of dCyd restored 72.2% of control colony formation for CFU-GM, but only 10.9% for L-CFU. When higher concentrations of Ara-C (eg, 5 X 10(-5) mol/L) were administered, dCyd-mediated protection toward CFU-GM decreased, but remained significantly greater than that observed for L-CFU. Incubation with 10(-3) mol/L of dCyd reduced the 4-hour intracellular accumulation of the triphosphate derivative of Ara-C (Ara-CTP) in both normal and leukemic cells by greater than 98%; under identical conditions, a significant expansion of the intracellular of the triphosphate derivative of dCyd (dCTP) pools was observed in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells but not in leukemic blasts. This finding was associated with a greater reduction in Ara-C DNA incorporation in normal elements. These in vitro studies suggest that dCyd may preferentially protect normal v leukemic myeloid progenitor cells from the lethal actions of high-dose Ara-C.\r"

The catalytic function of factor XIII, a transglutaminase, resides in the a-chain. To address questions regarding sites of synthesis of factor XIII a-chain, an EcoRI restriction fragment from the protein-coding region of the factor XIII a-chain cDNA was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. The cDNA probe showed hybridization with a single approximately 4.0-kilobase (kb) message in poly (A)+ mRNA prepared from normal human peripheral blood monocytes and normal human liver. The results demonstrate conclusively that factor XIII a-chains are actively synthesized in circulating monocytes and in liver. To our knowledge, these data represent the first demonstration of synthesis of any blood coagulation factor in primary uncultured and unstimulated monocytes or macrophage cells.\r"

Heterozygotes for this and two other beta-thalassemia types, which are also caused by deletions involving 5' beta promoter sequences, appear to have higher hemoglobin (Hb) A2 levels, perhaps because the loss of this promoter results in an increased transcription of the delta globin gene, as delta and beta promoters may be influenced by the same enhancing sequences 3' to the beta globin gene.\r"

Samples of attenuated poliovirus, platelets and plasma were uniformly irradiated with a XeCl excimer laser that delivered 40 nsec pulses of UV at 308 nm (UVB308). Intensities and exposure does were varied from 0.11 to 1.40 MW/cm2 and 0.51 to 56.0 J/cm2, respectively. In studies conducted with low intensity UVB308 (less than or equal to 0.17 MW/cm2), using exposure doses greater than or equal to 10.8 J/cm2, it was possible to inactivate poliovirus by 4 to 6 log10. Platelets irradiated with doses less than or equal to 21.5 J/cm2 exhibited minimal damage as assessed by aggregation activity and spontaneous release of serotonin. Examination of the coagulation activity of irradiated plasma indicated that exposure doses less than or equal to 21.5 J/cm2 resulted in less than 20% increase in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times. The use of UVB308 at a higher intensity (1.4 MW/cm2) over a similar range of exposure doses did not enhance viral inactivation but did result in increased damage to platelet and plasma proteins. These results demonstrate that at 308 nm there exists a \"window of efficacy\" for exposure doses between 10.8 and 21.5 J/cm2 and peak intensities less than or equal to 0.17 MW/cm2 in which a hardy virus is significantly inactivated and platelets and plasma proteins are, by functional criteria, minimally affected. Increased viral inactivation cannot be accomplished with higher UV intensities and will require additional or alternate measures.\r"

By molecular cloning and by genomic mapping we now demonstrate that the deletion of Spanish delta beta zero-thalassemia ends at approximately 11 and 17 kilobases (kb) downstream to the 3' endpoints of black hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) type 1 and 2, respectively. As suggested by the complete characterization of this and other deletional defects involving the beta globin gene cluster, the 5' and 3' breakpoints of several deletions cluster in rather restricted DNA areas, further strengthening the idea that common molecular mechanisms may operate in causing these deletions.\r"

In 14 of the biopsies, there was striking extracellular deposition of intensely autofluorescent eosinophil granules in addition to numerous intact eosinophils. Among the 14 specimens with extracellular autofluorescence were seven cases of leukemia, four cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, two cases of myelofibrosis, and one case of pancytopenia with eosinophilia. In the remaining 35 specimens, only intact eosinophils were identifiable. There was no extracellular autofluorescence in three normal marrows, four marrows from AIDS patients, or three biopsies from patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

The chemotaxis of RA monocytes, but not their random migration or chemokinesis, was significantly greater than that of monocytes from normal healthy subjects. To investigate whether this effect were due to soluble factors present in RA blood, the migration of monocytes from healthy subjects was assessed in the presence of sera from 28 RA patients and 21 healthy subjects. The inability of RA sera to modify the migration of normal monocytes implies that the enhanced chemotaxis of RA monocytes is attributable to the inherent property of these cells and not due to the activity of serum modifying factors.\r"

The stable complex, copper II bishistidinate (300 micrograms) was without effect. The Cu(II)gly induced syndrome has features more in common with osteoarthritis than rheumatoid arthritis in that erosion occurs in the absence of persistent synovial inflammation. The possibility that the damage may be caused by Cu(II)gly inducing free radical formation within the joint, leading to a self-perpetuating chain reaction is discussed. D-Penicillamine and other drugs were tested for their effects on the histological changes induced 4 weeks after the intra-articular injections of 100 micrograms Cu(II)gly. Few significant effects were observed and these were restricted to D-penicillamine, which caused inconsistent protection, sodium aurothiomalate which protected at a dose causing weight loss and prednisolone which exacerbated joint damage. It is concluded that the variability of the control response will need to be reduced before the model can be used for routine drug evaluation but it may be of value in the study of chronic degradative joint disease.\r"

The patients lacked the thermographic symmetry observed in 16 normal controls but this returned with resolution of the pain. Recognized radiological and scintigraphic features of algodystrophy were found. The long duration of symptoms, high proportion of young females and the severity of the associated disability were notable. It is suggested that algodystrophy is a more frequent cause of chronic knee pain than previously recognized. Autonomic abnormalities may be less intense in disease at this site, particularly in young females and may be overlooked. This characteristic of algodystrophy of the knee may contribute to chronicity and subsequent disability.\r"

Cervical subluxation was present in 29 of 44 (66%) in whom adequate radiographs were available. The development of cervical symptoms and signs could not have been predicted from the sex, age of onset, duration of disease or steroid therapy. Radiographic changes in the cervical spine were independent of major lower limb joint destruction and were often not present when planning a programme of joint replacement. Fifty-one control patients were studied. Cervical myelopathy occurred in 2 (4%) and subluxation in 24 (47%). The development of rheumatoid changes in the cervical spine was unrelated to involvement of the hip or knee joints in the control group. There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the incidence of cervical myelopathy in patients with multiple lower limb joint replacements compared with the control population.\r"

However, this method is far from being generally accepted. It is now possible to enhance the effectiveness of external beam irradiation and to use it to extend the field of sphincter-saving and conservative procedures. Our protocol consists of a split-course regimen with a short course of cobalt-60 arc rotation (3000 cGy in 12 days). After 2 months rest, the second stage of treatment depends upon the pressure of residual disease and the site of the tumour. It consists of either radical surgery (82 cases) or conservative treatment by intracavitary irradiation in the event of a favourable initial response or in the case of poor risk patients (73 cases). In the radiotherapy-surgical group, the subsequent operative specimens were tumour free in 17 per cent of cases and assigned to Dukes' A category in 32 per cent of cases. Of 91 patients with T2 or T3 tumour involving the lower third of the rectum (followed up for more than 3 years) 72 (84 per cent) had no recurrence. Thirty-three of these patients (46 per cent) underwent a colostomy while 39 (54 per cent) had normal anal function. These results demonstrate the major place that a properly planned external beam irradiation can have in the curative management of cancers of the low rectum.\r"

Later, radiotherapy was given alone. Seventy-four patients were treated with radical external beam radiotherapy for recurrent or inoperable rectal adenocarcinoma. One hundred and forty-five patients with advanced pelvic tumours or with metastases were treated with palliative pelvic radiotherapy. Twenty-four patients who had small-volume residual pelvic tumour or who were felt to be at high risk of pelvic recurrence following radical resection received postoperative radiotherapy. Complete tumour regression was seen in 38 per cent of radically treated patients, and 24 per cent of palliatively treated patients. Partial regression was observed in 56 per cent of radically treated patients, and 58 per cent of palliatively treated patients. Long-term local tumour control was more commonly observed for small tumours (less than 5 cm diameter). Fifty-eight per cent of patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy remained free of local recurrence. Survival was significantly better in patients with small tumours. The addition of 5FU did not appear to improve survival or tumour control. The value of radiotherapy in the relief of distressing symptoms related to the presence of pelvic tumour has been confirmed.\r"

Only two of the women with abscesses were lactating. Two patients had granulomatous mastitis. The remaining 36 patients were all considered to have periductal mastitis/mammary duct ectasia as the cause of their fistulas. The two mammillary fistulas associated with lactation healed spontaneously. Nine patients had the fistula excised and the wound packed; this resulted in satisfactory healing in all but one patient. Twenty-one patients had excision of the fistula and primary closure, without antibiotic cover, but only ten healed without complications and six patients required further surgical procedures for a recurrent fistula. Six patients had primary excision and closure under antibiotic cover with a penicillin and metronidazole; all healed. Mammillary fistulas are complications of the periductal mastitis/duct ectasia syndrome. They should be treated by excision and primary closure under appropriate antibiotic cover or alternatively excised and left open to granulate.\r"

By contrast, a subareolar abscess yielded a higher proportion of anaerobic bacteria and 46 per cent (13/28) of these patients had duct ectasia. We conclude that in present day practice a breast abscess is more likely to be related to duct ectasia than to the puerperium, and that patients with anaerobic infection or subareolar abscesses should be assumed to have duct ectasia and may require excision of the major duct system (Hadfield's procedure).\r"

Fewer cases in group III had histological evidence of cirrhosis than in the other two groups. There was a statistically significant marked decline in the preoperative cardiac and pulmonary function in group III patients. However, there was no statistical difference in postoperative complications, mortality and survival rate among the three groups. The results after hepatic resection seemed to depend on pre-operative liver function and histology, and on control of the haemorrhage at operation.

Tumour site, extent and relationship to bone and neurovascular structures determine whether adequate radical surgery is feasible or whether more limited excision as a part of multimodality treatment is appropriate. Pre-operative computed tomography (CT) was compared with operative findings in 38 patients with soft tissue sarcomas. CT prediction of muscle group involvement by tumour was correct in 95 per cent and prediction of major artery or vein invasion was correct in 92 per cent and 97 per cent respectively. Assessment of tumour relationship to major peripheral nerve was accurate for thigh sarcomas but was not possible in upper limb tumours. While CT confirmed frank bony involvement in two patients, it failed to distinguish between tumours closely adjacent to periosteum and those with periosteal invasion. Detection of residual or recurrent tumour nodules is less reliable; CT is most accurate before any surgical intervention.\r"

There were no significant differences between reviewed and unreviewed cases. Ninety-seven per cent of all cases were of the non-Hodgkin's type. The annual incidence was constant at 1.2 per cent of gastric malignancies. The mean age was 60 years and the male to female ratio 1:8. Presenting symptoms were similar to those of gastric cancer. Twenty-one per cent had a palpable mass but one-third of these were amenable to a potentially curative resection. Some 66 per cent were resectable and 58 per cent had a macroscopic clearance of tumour. TNM stage and absolute tumour size were significant prognostic factors (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.05 respectively) but the Kiel classification was not. The overall 5 year survival was 24 per cent. Apart from 10 patients whose only anti-tumour treatment was radiotherapy (5 year survival 36.9 per cent) no patient who did not have curative surgery survived 5 years. The 5 year survival for curative resection was 34 per cent and for curative resection plus radiotherapy was 43.5 per cent (45 and 73.4 per cent for the node negative cases respectively). A laparotomy is essential; 'curative' surgery possibly with adjuvant radiotherapy offers the best hope for cure.\r"

Thirty-seven patients (46 per cent) were felt to have inoperable lesions and were treated by supportive care only, while forty-four (54 per cent) underwent bowel resection and/or revascularization. Of these 44 patients 20 (45 per cent) survived, 14 (32 per cent) died of an early recurrence of infarction and 10 (23 per cent) died of an unrelated cause. In view of the high recurrence rate in the early postoperative period, treatment must prevent the causes of persistent or recurrent ischaemia such as vasoconstriction and reperfusion tissue damage. On the basis of recent clinical and experimental research we suggest that treatment should include routine angiography with selective perfusion of vasodilators through the superior mesenteric artery, pharmacological prevention of ischaemic and reperfusion tissue damage before surgery, and postoperative anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two patients with acute and subacute limb-threatening peripheral arterial ischaemia were treated with low dose intra-arterial streptokinase infusions. The mean duration of infusion was 38 h. Six patients developed pericatheter thrombosis and two had distal embolization of fragments of thrombus but in all cases these responded to repositioning the catheter and continuing the infusion. Five patients developed groin haematomata and in three of these there was evidence of a systemic fibrinolytic effect from the streptokinase with plasma fibrinogen reduced below 1 g/l. The most serious complication was perforation of the popliteal and tibial arteries which occurred on two occasions and required cessation of the infusion. Twenty-two patients (69 per cent) achieved limb salvage, eight (25 per cent) suffered a major amputation and two (6 per cent) died. The outcome was not related to the site, nature or duration of the arterial occlusion but patients with loss of sensation or paralysis of the affected limb were significantly less likely to obtain limb salvage (P = 0.001). For occlusions greater than 30 cm in length a new technique was used where the thrombus was lysed from distal to proximal in short lengths by gradual catheter withdrawal. This was successful in five out of six cases. Low dose intra-arterial streptokinase has been confirmed as an effective, relatively safe method of treatment in recent arterial ischaemia and can be recommended in situations where the results of surgery may not be favourable. In particular, patients with arterial thromboses and no distal run-off, distal and late arterial emboli, thrombosed popliteal aneurysms and patients after a failed embolectomy, have all been shown to respond to thrombolytic therapy with intra-arterial streptokinase.\r"

Fifteen control animals were compared with fourteen animals treated with subcutaneous Arvin 20 units kg-1 body weight day-1, starting 2 days before surgery and continuing for 2 days postoperatively. The peroperative fibrinogen level in the controls was 2.8 +/- 0.9 gl-1 compared with 0.4 +/- 0.3 gl-1 in the treated group. There was no significant difference in the peroperative or postoperative platelet count or haematocrit value between the two groups. Plasma viscosity and whole blood viscosity (at a low shear rate of 0.7s-1) were significantly less during and after surgery in the defibrinogenated group. The degree of defibrinogenation in these animals produced no problems with haemostasis during surgery or in the postoperative period. The cumulative patency rates of the controls at 24 h, 48 h, and 4 days were 43 per cent, 28 per cent and 28 per cent compared with 86 per cent (P less than 0.05), 73 per cent (P less than 0.05) and 73 per cent (P less than 0.05) respectively in the defibrinogenated group. In this model of a narrow PTFE graft with a poor run-off, defibrinogenation was a safe and effective method of improving early patency of small calibre arterial grafts.\r"

A water perfused thermode was used to vary anorectal temperature from 37 degrees C down to 32.5 degrees C and up to 41.5 degrees C. The temperature change was reported by the patient as the thermode temperature varied from 37 degrees C to each extreme and on return to base line. The anal canal in the control group was highly sensitive to temperature change, the lower rectum was significantly less sensitive (P less than 0.0001). At each level in the anal canal and lower rectum the incontinent group were significantly less sensitive than their controls (P less than 0.005). The mid-rectum had no appreciable sensation in either group. We consider that this sensory deficit may be an important factor in idiopathic faecal incontinence.\r"

The growth rates of the primary tumour were not altered by transfusing the animals with allogeneic blood 14 days before tumour inoculation, but spontaneous metastasis from tumours formed at the inoculation site was augmented and accelerated for both tumour types. This effect was dependent on the strain of the blood donor, metastases of B16 melanoma being augmented by transfusion with blood from Balb/c animals, and UV-2237 fibrosarcoma by transfusion with C57/BL6 blood, but not by blood from other donor strains tested.\r"

Half the rats in each group received calcium lactate 24 g/l added to their drinking water. Rats were killed 25-27 weeks postoperatively. Enterectomy increased colonic tumour yield by 60-106 per cent (P = 0.002-0.005) and duodenal tumour yield by 70-86 per cent. Calcium abolished this effect at both sites, halving intestinal tumour yields in rats with both transection and resection (P less than 0.05). Doubling the dietary intake of calcium inhibits experimental carcinogenesis.\r"

Patients with greater than 50 per cent burned surface area had higher plasma C3a and C5a concentrations than patients with 10-25 per cent burns (P less than 0.001) 1 week after injury. Six out of seven patients with greater than 50 per cent burned surface area developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and four out of seven bacteraemia. Twelve patients had 10-25 per cent burns and none of them developed ARDS or bacteraemia. The mean C3a concentration per millilitre of fluid from the burn bullae from nine different individuals was 2570 +/- 260 ng/ml. The C5a content in fluid from the bullae did not differ from the corresponding plasma range. Increased anaphylatoxin activity might explain extensive extravasation of fluid in burned patients. This increase might also be one reason for leukocyte accumulation in burned areas.\r"

In order to clarify the pressure changes occurring across the microvasculature after a thermal skin injury we have measured colloid osmotic pressures (COP) in interstitial fluid (COPi) of injured and non-injured skin as well as in plasma (COPp) from patients suffering major cutaneous burns. Interstitial fluid was collected with a wick-technique and analysed for COP. Measurements were performed as early as 6 h and continued until 56 h after injury. A severe hypoproteinaemia occurred in all patients with a marked reduction in COPp down to about 10 mmHg. Up to 12h post-burn we found a higher COPi in injured skin than in plasma. The first measurement of COPp averaged 9.8 mmHg as compared to an average COPi of 11.1 and 9.3 mmHg in injured and non-injured skin respectively. Measurements performed later than 12h showed a return of the transcapillary COP gradient towards the normal direction (COPp greater than COPi). The gradient was considerably less than in a normal situation. Based on the present observations of transcapillary COP it is suggested that colloids should be withheld until the transcapillary COP gradient returns to the normal direction.\r"

In 19 patients a marked fall was noted at around day 5 post-burn, and recovery to normal levels was variable and in some cases prolonged. A variety of symptoms, for example, dyspnoea and confusion, have been attributed to lowered serum cholinesterase activity and some workers have gone so far as to advocate blood transfusion to treat such a condition (Price et., 1970; Frohlich, 1977). In this study we found 13 patients (65 per cent) with such symptoms coexisting with a low serum cholinesterase activity. However, we do not believe these symptoms were directly attributable to the low enzyme activity for the following reasons: In only three of the 13 patients were symptoms observed at times when the lowest cholinesterase activity was recorded. A conventional explanation for these symptoms was available, except in three cases with abdominal distension. In six cases no symptoms were observed despite very low cholinesterase levels.\r"

Widespread contractures can be treated with thoracic flaps if healthy skin remains or else with the 'backwards flap'.

All deviations were documented by orthoptic assessment and photography. After treatment the patients were followed for up to 3 years. The beneficial effects of a single injection were modest, and a second injection was often necessary to achieve satisfactory ocular alignment. Thirteen of the 26 patients (50%) with nonparalytic strabismus and 10 of the 13 patients (77%) with paralytic strabismus had a good outcome (final deviation 12 prism dioptres or less). Adverse side effects included transient ptosis and diplopia and inadvertent vertical deviation. Twenty-one consecutive cases of nonparalytic horizontal strabismus treated with adjustable sutures were also reviewed. The results in these patients were more predictable and longer lasting than those in the patients who received botulinum toxin.\r"

Fluorescein angiography showed microaneurysms in 57% of the eyes in the second group photographed for the first time that had no detectable microaneurysms on colour photography.

The author presents four cases of serious visual impairment due to ethambutol therapy. Three of the patients were receiving a maintenance dosage of 15 mg/kg per day. The fourth patient was inadvertently given 25 mg/kg per day for 4 months. After therapy with the drug was stopped, improvement was slow, with complete recovery in two cases and only minor residual changes in a third. The patient who received the higher dosage of ethambutol suffered permanent, marked impairment. Ethambutol appears to contribute little to modern short-course antituberculous regimens that include more potent agents such as isoniazid and rifampin. In view of this and the potential for serious visual impairment, alternative antituberculous agents should be considered.\r"

Of the 693 hospital admissions and deaths 480 were associated with motorbikes, snowmobiles or all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). The incidence of injuries resulting from snowmobile and dirtbike accidents remained stable over the study period; however, there was an almost exponential increase in the number of admissions because of ATV-related injuries. There were 21 deaths during the study period. Preventive measures through legislation are necessary to reduce the numbers of injuries and deaths; these include mandatory registration, licensing and enhanced safety regulations.\r"

  ".W": "Bladder washing specimens from 81 patients with recurrent multifocal superficial bladder cancer were evaluated for DNA profile by flow cytometry and cell-surface blood group (ABH) antigen reactivity by a modified specific erythrocyte adherence test. The study was conducted in a prospective, blind, nonrandomized fashion. Fifteen patients were treated with transurethral resection (TUR) alone and 66 with TUR and intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin weekly for 6 weeks (TUR + BCG). Among the patients treated with TUR only, there was a notably greater rate of tumor recurrence and progression in patients with unfavorable tumor markers (aneuploidy and ABH-negative reactivity) than in those with favorable markers (diploidy and ABH-positive reactivity). The difference was less striking in patients treated with BCG, which reduced the frequency of recurrence or progression at 30 months from 87% to 44% and from 60% to 23%, respectively. This favorable effect of BCG was virtually confined to patients with initially favorable markers and to those whose initially unfavorable markers became favorable during BCG administration. Aneuploidy and negative ABH are phenotypic expressions of undifferentiation that can forecast the potential of the urothelium to form new tumors and predict invasion. To an extent, these markers are independent of the grade and stage of the disease. BCG can induce prognostically favorable conversion of the markers expression. Lack of such conversion indicates lack of response to BCG and should be regarded as evidence of persistent disease even if conventional methods do not reveal it. Therefore, sequential determination of markers is useful in monitoring patients with superficial bladder cancer treated with intravesical BCG.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two cases of adenocarcinoma of the urethra in women were studied. Nine were classified histologically as clear cell adenocarcinoma and 13 were classified as columnar/mucinous adenocarcinoma. Thirteen patients (59%) were black. The average patient age was 61 years (range, 27 to 76 years). Follow-up ranged from 6 to 194 months, (average, 40 months). At presentation, most patients (82%) had extension of tumor into adjacent structures or metastases to regional lymph nodes. Eighty-six percent received radiation therapy and 41% underwent an anterior exenteration or cystectomy. Eight of 22 patients (36%) had no evidence of disease 21 to 194 months after diagnosis (average, 83 months). Fourteen (64%) were dead of disease 6 to 23 months after diagnosis (average, 15 months). In general, the extent of tumor correlated best with survival time. Forty-four percent of patients with clear cell adenocarcinoma were dead of disease within 24 months of diagnosis, in contrast to 77% of those with columnar/mucinous adenocarcinoma, suggesting that patients with clear cell adenocarcinoma may have a better prognosis than those with columnar/mucinous adenocarcinoma. However, the difference in survival probability between the two groups was not found to be statistically significant. Recognition of the two histologic types of urethral adenocarcinoma is important to prevent misdiagnosis of such tumors as metastases (or direct extension) of nonurethral neoplasms having a similar histologic appearance. A possible predilection of the disease for black women has not been previously described.\r"

The patient was treated with aggressive combination chemotherapy followed by salvage surgery and remains in complete remission 3 years after diagnosis. Pure choriocarcinoma, although rare as a primary testicular neoplasm, accounts for 15% of extragonadal germ cell tumors in general and 30% of germ cell tumors in patients with Klinefelter's syndrome. Historically, the diagnosis of pure choriocarcinoma has been thought to convey a very poor prognosis. The occurrence of hyperthyroidism is unique to tumors containing choriocarcinomatous elements and the management of this disorder is discussed. Treatment of extragonadal germ cell tumors is also discussed with special reference to the roles of combination chemotherapy and salvage surgery.\r"

The prognostic value of a morphologic classification in multiple myeloma was further demonstrated by means of a multivariate linear regression analysis of survival data. Expected survival was calculated using clinical features and morphologic subtypes. The estimated survival time for plasmablastic myeloma was shorter by 51.4 months and for immature myeloma patients by 35 months, compared with mature myeloma patients with similar clinical characteristics. Plasma cell morphology at diagnosis is an important predictor of survival duration in patients with multiple myeloma.\r"

Thirty-four were associated with Barrett's esophagus. The 72 patients with involvement of both the upper stomach and lower esophagus (48 cardia and esophagus, 24 extensive) were identical with the esophagocardia group as a whole. The 24 patients with esophageal cancer and the 34 with Barrett's epithelium were the same clinically as the whole esophagocardia group except more had chronic reflux and hiatal hernia. The 33 patients with cancer confined to the cardia or cardia and fundus resembled the whole esophagocardia group but did not have Barrett's esophagus. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagocardia region is probably a different disease from cancer of the rest of the stomach.\r"

The clinical characteristics and the macroscopic and chronological changes were studied in these cases. Early gastric carcinoma comprised one third of all resected gastric carcinoma. If early gastric carcinoma was divided into two groups, the depressed and the elevated, the former was more common. By location, the depressed type lesions were more frequently seen in the middle third of the stomach and the elevated type lesions in the lower third. By age, distribution of the elevated type lesions showed a peak with a mode at the age of 60 to 69 years and of the depressed type, a plateau with a mode at the age of 50 to 59 years. The relative incidence of the elevated type of gastric carcinoma to the depressed type was one to four. In depth of invasion, the mucosa and the submucosa were equally involved. Lymph node metastases were encountered in 12.7% of early gastric carcinoma cases. The incidence of positive nodes in mucosal carcinoma was 3.4% and that of submucosal lesions was 21.7%. Of the elevated type carcinoma, 20.9% of the cases had positive nodes. The 5-year survival rate of the patients with surgery for cure was 93.8% in contrast to 56.5% of those with palliative resection.\r"

Little if any data exist to justify this treatment rationale in patients with adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Two patients who presented with clinical Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix, subsequently underwent radical surgical treatment. Pathologic review of the operative specimens revealed microscopic metastasis to the ovaries in both patients. It is suggested that ovarian preservation at the time of radical surgical treatment for adenocarcinoma of the cervix has not had its safety established, and that sacrificing the ovaries and providing hormonal replacement postoperatively may be a safer course.\r"

The gestations were divided into the following groups: Group 1, 43 pregnancies ending before therapy; Group 2, therapy given at conception or during 32 pregnancies; and Group 3, 58 pregnancies after therapy. Although the total frequencies of abnormalities were similar in Groups 1 and 2 (23% of 35 pregnancies not electively aborted and 28% of 25, respectively), there were slightly more elective abortions and birth defects related to radiation exposure at a susceptible time of gestation in Group 2. Still, there were eight normal infants among the ten fetuses who were liveborn and had first trimester exposure to chemotherapy alone; so, drug therapy early in pregnancy is not inevitably teratogenic. The apparent and surprising excess of abnormal outcomes in Group 3, 40% of 50 pregnancies, was due to low birth weight and premature terminations of pregnancy, rather than an excess of congenital anomalies. The type of unfavorable outcomes in Group 3 and their concentration in the first year posttherapy suggested they could represent defects in factors (e.g., uterine or hormonal) that normally maintain gestations, and not genetic damage to oocytes. Limitations of the data, collected by mail from physicians and their patients, included biases of self-reporting and low statistical power. Prospective study, probably through interinstitutional collaboration, seems necessary, if accurate estimates are to be made of the frequency of certain outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and minor anomalies.\r"

  ".W": "Whether or not serum selenium and vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) concentrations were changed was examined among healthy families of lung cancer patients. Family members as a whole (115 sons and daughters of 55 patients with primary lung cancer) were found to have a trend to lower serum selenium levels (0.116 +/- SD 0.024 microgram/ml, 0.05 less than P less than 0.1). Particularly among families of adenocarcinoma patients, the mean level was significantly lower (0.111 +/- 0.019 microgram/ml, P less than 0.05) than that (0.122 +/- 0.014 microgram/ml) in age-ratio matched controls who did not have cancer patients among their second-degree relatives. Serum vitamin E levels (11.85 +/- 2.85 micrograms/ml) were significantly lower among family members of adenocarcinoma patients than the controls (14.1 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.01). Serum selenium and vitamin E levels were significantly lower in lung cancer patients (n = 37, mean age, 63.9 +/- 11.2 yr) than in the controls (P less than 0.001). These data suggest that there are familial factors in serum selenium and vitamin E levels among families of lung cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "The outcome of therapy is reported in 34 previously untreated patients with advanced-stage (AJC IV) nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with combination chemotherapy (cisplatin and non-cisplatin based) and sequential radiation therapy. Sixty-nine patients treated with radiotherapy alone were used as a control group. The control group was matched for T and N stage grouping but differed in that 45% had keratinizing squamous carcinoma, 14.5% had nonkeratinizing squamous carcinoma, and 40.6% had undifferentiated carcinoma, compared with 18%, 50%, and 32.4%, respectively in the combined-treatment group. Seventeen of 21 patients (81%) who received chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy achieved complete remission (CR), whereas 11 of 13 patients (85%) who received radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy achieved CR (P = NS). Patients treated by radiotherapy alone had a 91% CR rate. The combined treatment yielded a relapse-free rate of 78% versus 44% for the radiotherapy group (P = 0.001). Median survival in the combined-treatment group has not been reached (111+ months), compared with 67 months in the group receiving radiotherapy alone (P = 0.04). The recurrence rate at the primary site and in regional nodes was more frequent in the radiotherapy group (36%), compared with the combined-therapy group (7%) (P = 0.004), but the occurrence of distant metastases was similar in each group (P = 0.41). The acute toxicity of the treatment was well tolerated. The major long-term toxic effect experienced by patients in the combined-therapy group was soft tissue fibrosis. These data suggest that a prospective trial comparing chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone is warranted.\r"

Two important variables, however, such as tumor volume and \"isoeffect thermal dose\" appeared to influence local tumor control. The volume effect was less pronounced in the lesions treated with radiotherapy plus heat than in those treated with radiotherapy alone, suggesting that the addition of heat was more damaging to the large than to the small lesions. Furthermore, a striking isoeffect thermal dose-response relationship was shown in head and neck lesions. Those data were collected and used to design a mathematical model relating the probability of local control to clinical and treatment variables. The analysis shows that, by using the same radiation parameters, the probability of local tumor control is a function of both \"isoeffect thermal dose\" and tumor volume.\r"

Three children developed ANLL, the other two had a transient myeloproliferative syndrome. The in vitro assay for CFU-GM showed abnormal results consistent with ANLL in the children who develop this disorder. Serial cytogenetic studies disclosed the appearance of an abnormal clone in one patient. A combination of clinical parameter in vitro colony studies and cytogenetic studies in these children was helpful in distinguishing ANLL from a myeloproliferative disorder. The NAP scores were not helpful.\r"

  ".W": "The leading cause of mortality in industrialized societies is sudden cardiac death. Almost half a million people die each year in the United States from myocardial ischemia and infarction leading to ventricular fibrillation. These phenomena result from severe coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis with acute mural thrombosis causing occlusion, which serves as the terminal event. Various studies have found evidence of fresh coronary artery mural thrombosis in 74 to 94 percent of patients undergoing autopsies shortly after death due to acute myocardial infarction. Not all thrombi are occlusive, but vasospasm associated with fresh injury to the diseased vessel may be sufficient with developing new thrombus to block blood flow. Because platelets are a major constituent of newly formed thrombi and contribute significantly to vaso-occlusive disease, it is important to understand basic aspects of their function. Such studies may lead to measures that prevent vascular disease and thrombosis. This chapter has described ultrastructural features of platelet-vessel wall interaction. Adhesion, spreading, secretion, and aggregate or thrombus formation have been emphasized. The findings of current studies indicate strong similarities between platelet-vessel wall interactions and the response of platelets to other surfaces. Also, platelet transformations observed during aggregate formation in suspension are identical to physical changes in thrombi on damaged vessels. The similarities are much more impressive than the differences. Therefore, the role of platelets in arterial thrombosis can be understood best as an extension of their hemostatic function. An advantage of this observation is that understanding basic mechanisms of platelet function in hemostasis can lead to solution of the problems presented by platelet involvement in thrombosis. The disadvantage is that agents used to prevent thrombosis can place the hemostatic mechanism in jeopardy. Finding the answer to this paradox will occupy our attention for years to come.\r"

All changes were more pronounced and prolonged in the dual component arthroplasty group. Histologic lung examination and morphometry demonstrated significant degrees of marrow (fat) microembolism in the dual arthroplasty model. Cardiopulmonary collapse has been associated with Guepar dual component arthroplasties clinically and these patients are at increased risk and should be monitored continuously. Prophylactic measures include meticulous lavage of the intramedullary cavity, increased FIO2, and maintenance of intravascular volume and cardiac output. The bilateral arthroplasty model is useful in investigating therapeutic interventions which may detect and prevent the marrow microembolism syndrome intraoperatively.\r"

The relationship between the concentrations of the different drugs and contractility (ESPL) can best be described by ESPL = a + b/(MAC fraction) where \"a\" is a constant and \"b\" is the slope of the curve relating ESPL to MAC. At 1.0 MAC values, the ESPL for halothane (69.04 +/- 25.83 mmHg X mm-1) did not differ from that of isoflurane (63.19 +/- 17.36 mmHg X mm-1). However, the myocardial contractility during 1.0 MAC halothane and isoflurane anaesthesia was better preserved than that of enflurane (38.66 +/- 9.73 mmHg X mm-1: p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05 respectively).\r"

Through an intravenous catheter placed preoperatively in a superficial vein of the foot, serial blood samples were drawn to measure the PvO2. In Group A, the PvO2 increased significantly after spinal anaesthesia compared with preoperative control values, then decreased when the sensory level receded to T11 or T12. In Group B, the changes in PvO2 from control to postspinal and to motor recovery were not significant. The authors postulate that sympathetic denervation induced by spinal anaesthesia increases the PvO2 by the opening of arteriovenous anastomoses in the cutaneous circulation, and the PvO2 decreases with sympathetic recovery. These findings confirm that significant sympathetic denervation of the lower limbs can be expected at a sensory level of T10 or above, and sympathetic recovery begins when the sensory level recedes below T10.\r"

Erythrocyte fragility was determined by the degree of haemolysis induced in solutions of decreasing osmolarity of NaCl. Halothane caused haemolysis of erythrocytes in an isoosmolar solution, being more potent at 42 degrees C than at 32 degrees C. Haemolysis produced by an hypoosmolar medium or halothane was potentiated by exogenously added phospholipase A2. Ethanol did not markedly alter the haemolysis of erythrocytes under conditions of decreasing osmolarity. Succinylcholine 10 mM did not significantly alter the susceptibility of erythrocytes to lysis by halothane. No differences in erythrocyte fragility were observed between preparations from normal and malignant hyperthermia susceptible patients under any of the conditions tested, despite the inclusion of malignant hyperthermia triggering agents in some instances. Although sampling a larger patient population might reveal slight differences between the groups, erythrocyte fragility tests do not appear to be useful in differentiating malignant hyperthermia susceptible from normal patients.\r"

The physiological dead space was smaller in the pregnant patients, due to a smaller alveolar dead space. The anatomical dead space was similar in both groups. A lowered physiological dead space suggests that there will be a decrease in the pulmonary ventilation perfusion ratio (V/Q) during Caesarean section; this could result from better perfusion of the ventilated alveoli than in the non-pregnant group, due to the increased cardiac output of pregnancy. An improvement in alveolar perfusion should also produce more efficient carbon dioxide elimination in pregnant patients, when compared to non-pregnant subjects.\r"

This was achieved by the serial measurement, with a calcium selective electrode, of calcium transients in Landrace MHS (five) and control Landrace/large white cross MH negative (five) swine following IV bolus injection of calcium gluconate 0.1 mmol X kg-1--a dose which induced an acute 45 per cent increase in plasma ionised calcium. Experimental animals were anaesthetised with ketamine 10 mg X kg-1 IM, thiopentone (intermittent divided doses) 15-25 mg X kg-1 (total) IV and N2O/O2 (FIO2 0.3) by IPPV to maintain a normal blood gas, acid/base state. The plasma ionised calcium decay curve observed in MHS swine did not differ from that of control normal swine. Further it was noted that the induced acute rise in plasma ionised calcium failed to trigger the MH syndrome in any MHS swine. It is concluded that the mechanisms of acute calcium homeostasis in MHS swine are normal. An explanation for the reduction in bone calcium content observed in MHS individuals must be sought, therefore, through study of the slow long-term component of the calcium regulatory process. In addition, the conventional strictures placed on the use, in MHS patients, of calcium gluconate are called in question.\r"

Significant intraoperative complications included arterial desaturation (SaO2 less than 90 per cent) in 26 per cent of procedures, and refractory hypertension requiring vasodilator therapy in 19 per cent. Intravenous anaesthesia was associated with a longer duration of recovery room care and a higher incidence of postoperative respiratory complications (delayed extubation, recovery room re-intubation and ventilation, and post-extubation stridor).

A mean decrease of 0.04 mmol X L-1 was noted, without pH change. The acute elevation of carbon dioxide following extubation allowed the in vivo effects of pH on ionized calcium to be studied. For each pH unit decrease, a mean rise of 0.60 mmol X L-1 of ionized calcium was found. During the study, no significant variations of plasma total calcium concentration were observed. The variations in the hydrogen ion concentration and the administration of succinylcholine were accompanied by changes of the free calcium ion concentration, due probably to alterations in calcium binding to proteins, and perhaps to the formation of a calcium complex with anions. Our results emphasize the importance of knowledge of the pH for the interpretation of ionized calcium variations in the presence of acid-base disturbances.\r"

Gravid women develop hypoglycaemia more readily than non-pregnant patients because they live in a state of \"accelerated starvation.\" Three cases are described of healthy parturients undergoing elective Caesarean section under lumbar epidural analgesia whose post-blockade hypotension was difficult to reverse until their low blood glucose concentrations had been normalized. Further investigations of the role played by blood glucose concentrations in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis in pregnant women are indicated. In the meantime, a preanaesthetic blood glucose determination will facilitate measures to ensure a normal blood glucose level before induction of anaesthesia for Caesarean section.\r"

Five of the six patients obtained effective and sustained pain relief. All of the patients had received placebo injections with normal saline in the paraspinous muscles, without effect. The mechanism of action of the blood patch in these patients is unclear. It is possible that the headache may have been caused by a low pressure cerebrospinal fluid state, due to an unknown anatomical or physiological defect of the ventriculo-spinal system. Further studies are needed to evaluate this treatment modality.\r"

A 0.03 ml air bubble was inserted into the different systems in close proximity to the transducer and measurements were repeated. There were dramatic changes in dynamic response with lengthening of tubing to a pole-mount configuration and air bubble additions. Only one transducer-tubing system had adequate accuracy and dynamic response in both the pole- and patient-mount version. Pressure waveforms in the pole-mount versions and with the air bubble produced systolic overshoots up to 35 mmHg. The performance characteristics dictate that the choice for a disposable transducer-tubing system must be made not only by design, but dynamic response which is directly related to clinical set-up.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors controlling membrane permeability to potassium of smooth muscle cells from rat aorta stimulated by depolarization. The increase 42K+ efflux (change in the rate constant) induced by depolarization (application of high concentrations of potassium chloride) was inhibited significantly by the calcium antagonists diltiazem and nisoldipine. Parallel inhibitory effects on contraction were observed. Diltiazem also inhibited potassium-stimulated 36Cl- efflux. The addition of 25-150 mM KCl to normal physiologic solution stimulated 42K+ efflux in a concentration-dependent manner. Diltiazem suppressed potassium-stimulated 42K+ efflux approximately 90% at 25 mM KCl and approximately 40% at 150 mM KCl. The ability of nisoldipine to inhibit 42K+ efflux also diminished as the potassium chloride concentration was elevated. The component of efflux that was resistant to calcium antagonists probably resulted from a decrease in the electrochemical gradient for potassium. Cellular water did not change during potassium addition. Substitution of 80 and 150 mM KCl for sodium chloride produced cellular swelling and enhanced potassium-stimulated 42K+ efflux compared with potassium chloride addition. The addition of sucrose to prevent cellular swelling reduced efflux response to potassium substitution toward that of potassium addition. A hypoosmolar physiologic solution produced an increase in the 42K+ efflux and a contracture that were both prevented by the addition of sucrose. We concluded that the depolarization-mediated 42K+ efflux has three components: one is calcium dependent; a second is dependent on cellular volume; and a third is resistant to inhibition by calcium antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was produced in guinea pigs after aortic stenosis (AS). The percentage of LVH in AS was determined by normalizing left ventricular (LV) weight by the mean LV weight of sham-operated controls (n = 12). After 3 weeks of cardiac overload, a mild LVH (30 +/- 3%) was induced in 17 animals and a relatively severe LVH (56 +/- 3%) was induced in 7 animals. LV papillary muscles were rapidly excised for mechanical studies. No significant differences were observed between control and mild hypertrophy groups. In contrast, a marked decrease in myocardial performance was seen in the more severe cardiac hypertrophy group and was expressed as a percentage of sham-operated levels (Vmax, 22%; active isometric force/mm2, 23%; +dF/dt max/mm2, 26%). Relaxation in this group was still more impaired than contraction (peak lengthening velocity, 14%; -dF/dt max/mm2, 19%). Moreover, the load sensitivity of relaxation was present in both sham-operated controls and mild hypertrophy but almost disappeared in more severe hypertrophy. Isometric relaxation was delayed in the latter group, as shown by the 15% increase of the half-time of the decline of isometric relaxation (t 1/2). On the other hand, acute hypoxia (95% N2-5% CO2 for 20 minutes) also induced a fall in contractility and the disappearance of the load sensitivity of relaxation but with a 67% decrease of t 1/2. Thus, the mechanical analysis of relaxation allows the effects of chronic overload in relatively severe cardiac hypertrophy to be separated from those of acute hypoxia. Moreover, in severe cardiac hypertrophy, the impairment of the load sensitivity of relaxation with increased t 1/2 strongly suggests alterations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, especially since the moderate decrease in the myofibrillar ATPase activity, which has been observed previously in guinea pig pressure overload, cannot account completely for the marked fall in myocardial performance.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of exogenous and endogenous adenosine on exocytotic noradrenaline release were studied in rat hearts perfused in situ. Exocytotic release of endogenous noradrenaline (determined by high pressure liquid chromatography) was induced by electrical stimulation of the left cervicothoracic ganglion. Exogenous adenosine significantly reduced noradrenaline overflow from the heart. This suppression of noradrenaline overflow was not influenced by desipramine, indicating a mechanism independent from noradrenaline reuptake. The A1 subtype specific agonists cyclohexyladenosine and R-phenylisopropyladenosine had inhibitory effects at lower concentrations than adenosine and S-phenylisopropyladenosine, suggesting the relevance of presynaptic inhibitory adenosine receptors of the A1 subtype. Short ischemic periods of 3 minutes resulted in a marked coronary venous overflow of adenosine during reperfusion. This was accompanied by an inhibition of noradrenaline release evoked by nerve stimulation during ischemia. The adenosine antagonists theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline prevented this suppression of noradrenaline release. Blockade of oxidative phosphorylation by cyanide in combination with glucose-free perfusion induced an increased formation of endogenous adenosine and suppression of stimulation-evoked noradrenaline overflow. Again, in the presence of the adenosine antagonists theophylline or 8-phenyltheophylline, this suppression was abolished. These results indicate that adenosine is a potent inhibitor of exocytotic noradrenaline release in the heart with relevance during conditions of increased endogenous adenosine formation such as myocardial ischemia.\r"

Body weights were increased in FGX and FTX + P and were increased further in FGX + T but were normal in FGX + E and FGX + EP. Heart weights were unchanged in F groups except in FGX + T, where it was increased. Cardiac performance in perfused hearts, as measured by stroke work, ejection fraction, fractional shortening and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, was decreased in MGX but was slightly increased in MGX + T. Papillary muscle studies showed increases in time to peak tension and one-half relaxation in MGX, but these were decreased in MGX + T. Isotonic shortening studies showed decreased velocity of shortening in MGX and increased velocity in MGX + T. Heart function was significantly decreased in FGX and FGX + P compared with FSH but was similar to FSH in FGX + E and FGX + EP. FGX + T had greater stroke work and ejection fraction than FSH and FGX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aftercontractions, delayed afterdepolarizations, and automaticity occurred in guinea pig papillary muscles that were reoxygenated after hypoxic conditioning. The emergence of dysfunction was dependent on the severity of hypoxic conditioning and on stimulation during reoxygenation. After 60 minutes of substrate-free hypoxia, reoxygenation induced automaticity in a high proportion of stimulated muscles; the automaticity appeared within 1 minute and lasted for 10-20 minutes. After similar conditioning, muscles reoxygenated for 7-15 minutes were stimulated at various cycle lengths. The incidence of automaticity and the amplitudes of delayed events had W-shaped dependencies on cycle length (200-1,000 msec), whereas coupling intervals had M-shaped dependencies. In ventricular myocytes that displayed automaticity after reoxygenation, extrasystolic upstrokes arose smoothly from delayed afterdepolarizations that reached threshold. In tissue, extrasystolic upstrokes usually rose sharply from delayed afterdepolarizations that were distinctly subthreshold. Thus, threshold was reached elsewhere in the tissue. Further evidence of electrical heterogeneity was obtained from surface mapping of delayed-afterdepolarization amplitude in reoxygenated muscle. There were no detectable aftercontractions, delayed afterdepolarizations, or signs of automaticity in quiescent reoxygenated muscles or in stimulated reoxygenated muscles that were treated with 1 microM ryanodine. We conclude that the dysfunction precipitated by reoxygenation is due to synchronized spontaneous releases of calcium from overloaded sarcoplasmic reticulum.\r"

Our two goals were to demonstrate that large areas of membrane can be preserved free of visible ice crystal damage and, thus, be amenable to quantitative analysis and to compare the structure of directly frozen myocardial membranes with conventionally prepared tissue. The E face was most affected by lack of chemical pretreatment. First, our laboratory reported an increase in E face particle density from 379 +/- 30/micron 2 in conventional fixed tissue to 489 +/- 18/micron 2 in unpretreated tissue. Discrete arrays of 12-15 nm particles on the E face were a striking feature of the unfixed sarcolemma. However, P face intramembrane particle (IMP) density remained unchanged from previous estimates in fixed tissue. Specialized regions of the sarcolemma were enhanced in ultrarapidly frozen tissue. Particle domains of the adherens junctions were very prominent in forming a cap alongside the gap junctions. Both the P and E faces of the gap junctions were highly ordered into hexagonal arrays. Caveolae in the membrane were infrequent in both P and E faces.\r"

  ".W": "[Ca2+]i transients, elicited by voltage-clamp depolarization of single guinea pig cardiac ventricular cells, were observed through use of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2. Individual cells, loaded with fura-2 either by internal perfusion or by exposure to fura-2/AM, were studied with the use of an inverted microscope that was equipped with ultraviolet epifluorescence illumination, an intensified silicon intensifier target camera, and a photomultiplier tube. Variation of membrane voltage and exposure of cells to verapamil (a Ca2+ channel blocker) and ryanodine (which was assumed to abolish selectively the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum) were used to investigate the cellular processes that determine the [Ca2+]i transient. The principal results of the study are: When appropriate methods are used, the properties of cytosolic fura-2 inside guinea pig cells are similar to those of fura-2 in solution, irrespective of the method of loading. The amplitude (at 100 msec) of verapamil-sensitive fluorescence transients elicited by pulse depolarization (range -30 to 80 mV) has a bell-shaped dependence on membrane voltage (maximum at 10 mV). Rapid, ryanodine-sensitive and verapamil-sensitive \"tail transients\" are elicited on repolarization from membrane potentials greater than 30 mV; their amplitude increases as the amplitude of the preceding pulse increases. The amplitude of slow fluorescence transients that are insensitive to verapamil and ryanodine increases continuously with membrane potential throughout the range -20 to 80 mV. The voltage dependence and pharmacology of the rapid transients elicited by pulse depolarization or by repolarization are consistent with their having arisen from Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Superoxide-radical-induced damage appears to be one of the mechanisms of this injury. We tested whether granulocytes were a direct source of injury in the stunned myocardium in the 15-minute ischemia dog model. Regional function during agranulocytic extracorporeal coronary perfusion (using Leukopak filters) with ischemia and reperfusion was compared with function during a second period of ischemia and reperfusion after removal of the filters (granulocytopenia). Flow reduction and reperfusion flow, preload, afterload, and inotropic stimulation were the same during agranulocytic and granulocytopenic perfusion. During agranulocytic perfusion, stunning did not occur (greater than 100% of preischemic function during reperfusion), but when the filters were removed and about 10% of the normal granulocyte count was present, stunning occurred with only 76% return of function at 60 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.01). A second series of studied animals with extracorporeal perfusion and granulocyte replete perfusion all had less than 75% return of regional function, indicating that the agranulocytic perfusion and not the extracorporeal aspects of the experiment prevented stunning. We conclude that granulocytes are the direct source of the injury in stunned myocardium and apparently the main source of superoxide in the 15-minute ischemia dog model. Other possible granulocyte-related mechanisms of reperfusion injury include capillary no-reflow, causing microvascular ischemia and degranulation leading to enzyme-induced damage.\r"

Specifically, the influence of low sodium medium on contractile state, calcium fluxes, and cytosolic free [Ca] [( Ca]i) was examined. [Ca]i was measured using fura-2. Mean [Ca]i in control medium was 126 +/- 14 nM. Exposure of cells to sodium-free or sodium- and calcium-free medium (choline-substituted) resulted in contracture development, which returned toward the baseline level over 2-3 minutes. The Nao-free contracture was associated with a tenfold increase in [Ca]i (1,280 +/- 110 nM) followed by a gradual decrease to a level fourfold above control [Ca]i (460 +/- 58 nM). Nao- and Cao-free contracture was associated with a fivefold increase in [Ca]i (540 +/- 52 nM) followed by a rapid decrease to below 80 nM. Sodium-free medium failed to produce an increase in [Ca]i or contracture in cells preexposed to calcium-free medium, although caffeine, when subsequently added to sodium- and calcium-free medium, was able to elicit a transient increase in [Ca]i and contracture. Brief, 5-second preperfusion of cells with La3+ (1 mM) or EGTA (1 mM) abolished the Nao-free contracture and the increase in [Ca]i. In the presence of 20 mM caffeine, removal of Nao resulted in minimal changes in the resting position of the cell although 45Ca uptake and [Ca]i were increased in response to sodium-free medium; the subsequent decrease in [Ca]i was greatly slowed. Addition of caffeine during the relaxation phase of the sodium-free contracture produced an additional transient contracture and transient increase in [Ca]i. Ryanodine (1 microM) abolished this effect of caffeine. Caffeine or ryanodine abolished Nao- and Ca-free contracture. CCCP (2 microM), a potent oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, did not significantly affect calcium efflux rate. In the presence of 2 microM CCCP, removal of sodium resulted in an augmented contracture signal and a rise in [Ca]i, followed by a slow decrease. We conclude that removal of extracellular sodium enhances transsarcolemmal entry of calcium via sodium-calcium exchange, but this effect alone does not lead to the development of sodium-free contracture. Calcium displaceable by lanthanum or EGTA appears to contribute to Nao-free or Nao- and Cao-free contracture. Studies using caffeine and ryanodine suggest that removal of Nao leads to release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (presumably via calcium-induced calcium release).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Standard microelectrode techniques were used to study the effects of a free radical generating system on action potentials recorded from guinea pig ventricular myocardium. Free radicals were generated by mixing xanthine oxidase (0.02-0.04 mu/ml) with the superfusate-modified Locke's solution containing purine 2.3 mM. The system was validated by demonstrating that it could reduce cytochrome C at a rate of 15.9 +/- 1.5 mol/l/min. This rate was decreased to 3.0 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.001) in the presence of superoxide dismutase (12 mg/100 ml), and the reaction was absent if xanthine oxidase and purine were premixed for 60 minutes prior to adding cytochrome C. Superfusion of guinea pig ventricular strips with the free radical generating system (20-30 minutes) resulted in a highly significant reduction in resting potential from -79.3 +/- 1.8 mV to -70.9 +/- 1.4 mV (p less than 0.0001, n = 6) and in action potential amplitude from 110.9 +/- 2.2 mV to 101.7 +/- 4.0 mV (p less than 0.0001). There was an accompanying fall in maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) from 254.1 +/- 17.7 V/sec to 207.1 +/- 18.6 V/sec (p less than 0.01) and no significant change in action potential duration. These changes were accompanied by spontaneous activity in 3 of 6 preparations and reversed after 20-30 minutes washing in Locke's solution. They were largely abolished by adding superoxide dismutase (12 mg/100 ml) to the superfusate and completely absent if the xanthine oxidase and purine were premixed for 60 minutes before superfusing the myocardium. We conclude that the phenomena observed may contribute to the genesis of reperfusion arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The development of cardiac hypertrophy is associated with marked changes in cardiac autonomic innervation. Significant and sustained reductions of myocardial catecholamine stores and activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase have been reported in models of acutely induced ventricular hypertrophy. Conversely, activity of choline acetyltransferase, a marker of parasympathetic nervous function, shows transient increases during the development of acute right ventricular hypertrophy. The potential physiological importance of these changes prompted us to examine a clinically more relevant model of slowly progressive ventricular hypertrophy. Application of a loose band around the pulmonary artery of weanling guinea pigs resulted in a growth-related progressive right ventricular pressure overload. Right ventricular weight-to-body-weight ratio was increased significantly and progressively at 9 and 18 weeks in banded animals (0.92 +/- 0.05 and 1.31 +/- 0.11 mg/g, respectively, p less than 0.01) compared with sham-operated controls (0.55 +/- 0.02 and 0.59 +/- 0.01 mg/g, respectively) but showed no further gain at 27 weeks (1.41 +/- 0.10 mg/g). Activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase remained unchanged in all experiment groups, while right ventricular contents of norepinephrine in banded animals at 18 and 27 weeks exhibited sustained and progressive increases (2.45 +/- 0.11 and 3.40 +/- 0.19 micrograms/right ventricle, respectively) over controls (1.80 +/- 0.13 and 2.40 +/- 0.22 micrograms/right ventricle, respectively, p less than 0.01). The activity of choline acetyltransferase was markedly elevated in banded animals at 18 weeks (32.6 +/- 2.7 nmol/hr/right ventricle) but returned to baseline by 27 weeks (22.8 +/- 1.4 nmol/hr/right ventricle).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscles from failing hearts showed a diminished capacity to restore low resting Ca2+ levels during diastole. These experiments provide the first direct evidence from actively contracting human myocardium that intracellular Ca2+ handling is abnormal and may cause systolic and diastolic dysfunction in heart failure.\r"

Radiolabelled microsphere-assessed regional myocardial perfusion and endocardial excursion determined by two-dimensional echocardiography were measured during control conditions prior to mid-LC occlusion with left anterior descending coronary arterial pressure (LADP) equal to aortic pressure (AoP) (Stage 0) and to 3 randomly performed postocclusion stages. At each postocclusion stage, the perfusion territory of the occluded LC bed (area at risk) was measured in vivo using myocardial contrast two-dimensional echocardiography. During Stage 1 (LADP = AoP), area at risk was 5.1 +/- 0.9 cm2 (x +/- 1 SD) and transmural blood flow to the LC arterial bed decreased from 0.96 +/- 0.50 ml/min/g (Stage 0) to 0.16 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g (p less than 0.01), while endocardial excursion decreased from 28.0 +/- 9.0% to 2.0 +/- 10.0% (p less than 0.01).

  ".W": "Prolonged stimulation of tissues by adrenergic agonists may lead to diminished responsiveness of the tissues to subsequent activation by catecholamines; this phenomenon has been termed desensitization or tachyphylaxis. We have examined the in vivo consequences of prolonged stimulation of vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors in rats harboring pheochromocytoma, a tumor that secretes catecholamines. In both early (3-4 weeks after implantation) and late (6-7 weeks after implantation) stages of tumor development, New England Deaconess Hospital rats with transplanted pheochromocytomas developed hypertension and tachycardia and had plasma dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations markedly greater than controls. In both these stages of pheochromocytoma, pressor responses to several vasoconstrictors were examined after pithing. Rats with the tumor were found to become progressively subsensitive to alpha-adrenergic agonists. In the early phase of pheochromocytoma, loss in sensitivity was found for both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, whereas responsiveness to the nonadrenergic vasoconstrictors Arg-vasopressin and angiotensin-II was intact (homologous desensitization). However, in the later stage of pheochromocytoma, pressor responses to all these vasoconstrictive agents and also to stimulation of the complex sympathetic outflow were found to be subsensitive (heterologous desensitization). In plasma membranes prepared from mesenteric arteries of early stage tumor-bearing rats, [3H]prazosin binding sites were significantly decreased to 150 +/- 12 fmol/mg vs. 234 +/- 19 fmol/mg in controls. [3H]Yohimbine binding sites were not significantly altered. Our results show that both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasopressor responses can be specifically attenuated in the presence of chronically elevated endogenous catecholamine levels produced by pheochromocytoma and that each alpha-receptor subtype may be differently regulated in the development of desensitization.\r"

We obtained echocardiograms at baseline and serially (on seven occasions) during a 1 year treatment period with the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor atenolol in 12 patients with previously untreated essential hypertension. To ensure control of blood pressure in all patients throughout the study, it was necessary to add a thiazide diuretic to the therapy of five patients. Baseline blood pressure was 155/100 mm Hg and fell to 136/84 mm Hg; there was a 20% reduction in heart rate. Posterior and septal wall thicknesses were reduced from 1.16 +/- 0.03 to 1.06 +/- 0.02 cm (p less than .05) and from 1.28 +/- 0.07 to 1.18 +/- 0.06 cm (p less than .05), respectively; this reduction became significant initially at 4 weeks. Left ventricular mass decreased from 144 +/- 9 to 127 +/- 7 g/m2 (p less than .05) and this fall first became statistically significant at 6 months. Significant reduction in electrocardiographic voltages was also seen at 6 months. Therefore, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with atenolol-induced blood pressure control occurred as early as 4 weeks after starting therapy and was maintained thereafter without apparent compromise of left ventricular systolic function.\r"

Their ages ranged from 40 to 90 (66 +/- 14, mean +/- SD) years. We examined these subjects by pulsed Doppler echocardiography combined with two-dimensional echocardiography to determine the prevalence of valvular regurgitation. Regurgitation began to appear in subjects in their fifties, increasing in prevalence with advancing age (r = .81, p less than .001), and was documented in all over age 80. Similarly, regurgitation involving more than one valve appeared in those 60 years and older, and was very common (89%) in subjects in their eighties. With each type of valvular regurgitation, the prevalence of each type of regurgitation increased with aging, but this tendency was most prominent for aortic regurgitation. We conclude that (1) single or multivalvular regurgitation as detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography is very common in the aged and may be considered a normal finding in the absence of other evidence of heart disease, and (2) the high prevalence of regurgitation in the aged must be taken into account when Doppler examinations are being performed.\r"

Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or peripheral arterial disease or those treated with hypolipidemic drugs were excluded from the analysis. The numbers of subjects with a paternal or maternal history of early myocardial infarction were 123 and 30, respectively. After adjustment for age, cigarette consumption, alcohol consumption, and body mass index, subjects with parental history of myocardial infarction had higher levels of total cholesterol (p less than .01), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p less than .01), and apoprotein B (APOB) (p less than .0001) and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p less than .05) than subjects with no parental history of myocardial infarction. On the other hand, apoprotein A1 (APOA1) and triglyceride levels were not different between the two groups. The ratios of HDL/total cholesterol and APOA1/APOB were also lower in presence of parental myocardial infarction (p less than .001 and p less than .01, respectively). When a discriminant analysis was performed, only APOB level was related to parental myocardial infarction. The results for paternal and maternal history were very similar and were grouped for the analysis. We conclude that part of the known relationship between parental history of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease could be mediated by an increased APOB level.\r"

In addition, black children had a relatively higher frequency of joint occurrence of high levels of both HDL2-C and HDL3-C. A significant sex-related difference, with girls showing higher values than boys, was noted among younger age groups for HDL2-C. A male-female crossover trend in HDL2-C levels was apparent only among white children, with girls showing higher values after age 11. Both age and sexual maturation were inversely associated with HDL3-C levels in white children, irrespective of sex (p less than .001). Serum triglycerides were inversely related to both HDL2-C and HDL3-C only in white children (p less than .001). A black-white difference in HDL2-C persisted only among boys and girls in the older age group after adjusting for the covariates (sexual maturation, age, adiposity, oral contraceptive use, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and serum triglycerides). With respect to HDL3-C, the covariate-adjusted difference remained significant only among boys in the older age group. Metabolic variations between the races in response to both physiologic and environmental factors likely account for the divergence in antiatherogenic HDL pattern.\r"

The factors that determine this crossover of age-specific death rates have not been elucidated. Selection from the black population of younger individuals who are sicker by virtue of being more coronary prone might leave a relatively healthier group of older persons. Support for this hypothesis would consist in part of evidence that coronary artery disease has an earlier onset in the black population. We examined data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the years 1973-1984 to determine if age-related differences in case-fatality rates existed between whites and nonwhites. In-hospital case fatality rates were 10% to 70% higher for each of the 10 year age groups for nonwhites up to age 70, at which time a crossover occurred. The median age at death from myocardial infarction was approximately 5 years younger in nonwhites compared with whites. National estimates of hospitalization rates for myocardial infarction from these data likewise suggest that nonwhites receive less health care for coronary artery disease than whites relative to recorded fatal events. The age-specific trends in case-fatality support the hypothesis that a cohort selection effect in part determines the black/white differentials in coronary artery disease. Relative susceptibility of the black and white population is thus not appropriately estimated by age-adjusted rates, but should be examined on an age-specific basis within the framework of selection effects on a cohort.\r"

The magnitude of the maximum ST segment elevation (denoted Vmax) and magnitude of the maximum ST segment depression (denoted Vmin), as well as the ST depression on the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram were analyzed against morbidity and mortality (at a median follow-up time of 14 months). A value obtained by subtracting Vmax from Vmin correlated (p less than .0002) with outcome. Correlations were also found between Vmin and complications, Vmin and mortality, and between increasing levels of ST depression on the 12-lead electrocardiogram and mortality. The maps were also studied by grouping the 100 ST segment map patterns into five groups by cluster analysis techniques. One group showed marked anterior negativity and had 37% mortality compared with an overall 5% mortality for the remaining groups. The limited arteriographic and autopsy data available indicated that the findings of a diseased artery or arteries corresponded with the results of mapping. The mean map patterns of the five groups showed that, in most patients with inferior infarction, the standard chest leads V1 to V6 are over a region of steep voltage gradient. Small changes in the position of the standard chest lead can cause large changes in the displayed potentials. This study indicates that patients at high risk after acute inferior infarction can be identified by surface mapping on admission to the coronary care unit.\r"

Six patients with pulmonary venous obstruction were identified, the diagnosis being confirmed at catheterization or autopsy. The venous flow pattern in this group was uniformly high velocity and turbulent. It was possible to localize the site of obstruction in each case. Although pulmonary edema was present in each patient, the chest radiograph did not provide reliable information as to the exact site of obstruction. Combined two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is a useful adjunct in the postoperative evaluation of patients with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.\r"

Antimyosin scans were positive in nine patients who had evidence of myocarditis on right ventricular biopsy, and negative in 11 who had no evidence of myocarditis by biopsy. The remaining eight had positive antimyosin scans but showed no evidence of myocarditis on right ventricular biopsy. On the basis of a right ventricular biopsy standard, the sensitivity of this method was 100%, the specificity 58%. We conclude that antimyosin antibody imaging is a reliable screening method for the evaluation of patients suspected of having myocarditis, and that a positive antimyosin scan indicates the need for right ventricular biopsy to establish the histologic diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether high current strength pacing at the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia (VT) could prevent induction of VT, we studied 11 VTs in 10 patients with chronic coronary artery disease. The left ventricular site of origin of all VT was determined by endocardial catheter mapping. Reproducible VT induction from the right ventricular apex or outflow tract was demonstrated with a pacing current strength equal to twice diastolic threshold (less than or equal to 2.0 mA) with single (two VTs), double (eight VTs), or triple (one VT) extrastimuli following 8 beats of a drive cycle length of 400 to 600 msec. After determination of the baseline VT induction zone (range 10 to 80 msec), repeat induction was attempted while simultaneous pacing was performed during the 8 beat drive train from the left ventricular site of origin with the use of a high current strength (10 mA [two VTs] or 20 mA [nine VTs]) and from the baseline right ventricular site with a current strength equal to twice diastolic threshold. Extrastimuli were introduced only from the right ventricular site over the same range of coupling intervals that resulted in VT initiation during the baseline state. In five of the 11 trials, no VT could be initiated; in one trial, the VT induction zone was decreased from 80 to 10 msec; in three trials, only VT of a different morphology and a distinct (greater than 4 cm distant) site of origin was initiated; and in two trials, VT of the same morphology was initiated. In four of the five trials in which all VT was prevented by simultaneous pacing with a high current strength at the site of origin, simultaneous pacing at a lower current strength (twice diastolic threshold) at the site of origin (three VTs) or with equally increased current strength (10 to 20 mA) at nonsites of origin (two VTs) did not prevent initiation. We conclude that: high current strength pacing at the site of origin during the drive train can inhibit VT induction with extrastimuli and, successful prevention of VT may depend on the pacing site being the site of origin and the current strength used during pacing.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we introduce a new concept of systolic myocardial stiffness that extends the Suga-Sagawa maximum ventricular elastance concept to the myocardium. End-systole is defined as the time of maximum systolic myocardial stiffness (max Eav), which we examined for its load independence and sensitivity to changes in the inotropic state and to heart rate. Seven adult mongrel dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic crystals for measurements of long and short axes and left ventricular wall thickness, and a high-fidelity micromanometer was inserted for measurement of left ventricular pressures. Preload and afterload were altered by inferior vena cava occlusion, nitroprusside, angiotensin II, atropine, propranolol, and various combinations with propranolol. End-systolic stress-strain relations (slope: max Eav) were linear in all seven dogs, implying that end-systolic myocardial stiffness is independent of end-systolic stress. Changes in max Eav (for constant preload and afterload) reflected changes in the ejection fraction; max Eav was also insensitive to propranolol and to changes in heart rate over the range from 120 to 180 beats/min. End-systolic pressure-volume relations (ESPVRs), derived analytically from these stress-strain relations, were nonlinear, and estimates of volume at zero stress (Vom) were always positive. On the other hand, ESPVRs obtained on the basis of the Suga-Sagawa maximum ventricular elastance concept, were linear, and volume at zero pressure (Vop) estimated by linear extrapolation was negative in one case. Based on the concept of systolic myocardial stiffness, the slope of the ESPVR varies with end-systolic volume and attains its maximum value (Emax) at zero end-systolic pressure. Normalization of Emax with Vom demonstrated a close relationship to max Eav. Thus both max Eav and Vom and Emax are ideal variables for assessing changes in myocardial contractility when preload and afterload are constant. Furthermore, Vom and max Eav permit development of the entire ejection fraction-afterload relationship for a given preload, thus providing a method for comparing myocardial contractile states between ventricles.\r"

However, the subsequent suggestion that right heart intracavitary pressure equals, or nearly equals, pericardial surface pressure is not strictly consistent with the physiology of pericardial constraint. If right heart pressure equals pericardial surface pressure, then transmural right heart pressure equals zero. Because of the difficulty in measuring pericardial pressure directly in the beating heart we designed an experiment in the recently arrested canine heart in situ to measure pericardial pressure indirectly and to test the hypothesis that right heart transmural pressure is zero under reasonably physiologic, static equilibrium conditions. According to a static equilibrium analysis of the pressures acting across the walls of the heart, at a given volume the change in right heart pressure caused by removing the pericardium is equal to the pericardial pressure when the pericardium is intact. We found that this drop in pressure caused by pericardiectomy did not equal right heart pressure and therefore that right heart transmural pressure does not equal zero.\r"

  ".W": "According to the thoracic pump model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the heart serves as a passive conduit for blood flow from the pulmonary to the systemic vasculature, necessitating an open mitral valve and anterograde transmitral blood flow during chest compression. To assess the applicability of this model to manual CPR techniques, two-dimensional echocardiograms were recorded from the right chest wall and/or the esophagus in nine dogs (18 to 26 kg) during manual CPR. The aortic valve opened with chest compression and closed with release, while the pulmonary and tricuspid valve leaflets closed with compression and opened during release. The mitral valve remained open during ventilation alone and during abdominal compressions. With the onset of brief, high-velocity (high-impulse) chest compressions, the mitral valve closed rapidly and the left ventricle was deformed, whether compressions were applied to the sternum or the left mid-chest wall. The mitral valve reopened with release of each compression. Left atrial echocardiographic contrast injections confirmed the absence of anterograde transmitral blood flow during high-impulse compression and its presence during release. Failure of mitral leaflet approximation during chest compression was observed only when a very low-velocity, prolonged (low-impulse) compression technique was used, or when regions that did not directly overlie the heart were compressed. Consistent with these observations, simultaneous recordings of the left ventricular and left atrial pressures during high-impulse sternal compressions in five dogs (19 to 25 kg) demonstrated peak and mean left ventriculoatrial pressure gradients of 38.5 +/- 4.0 and 13.5 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively, and these pressure gradients declined with less impulsive compressions. The observations made during all but low-impulse chest compressions are inconsistent with the thoracic pump model, and support direct cardiac compression as the primary mechanism of forward blood flow with more impulsive manual chest compression techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Denervation supersensitivity was demonstrated in anesthetized dogs 5 to 10 days after transmural myocardial infarction produced by latex embolization of a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Sympathetic efferent denervation in noninfarcted myocardium apical to the infarction was demonstrated by a 90% depletion of myocardial norepinephrine content in the apical (45 +/- 15 pg norepinephrine/g tissue) vs basal (437 +/- 76 pg/g tissue) regions and by the lack of effective refractory period (ERP) shortening during bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation in 34% of sites apical to the infarction. Supersensitivity in the area apical to the infarction was manifested by an exaggerated shortening of the ERP during both norepinephrine and isoproterenol infusions, with an upward and leftward shift in the dose-response curves in the apical vs basal regions (p less than .001). The cellular mechanism for denervation supersensitivity did not involve detectable changes in the beta-adrenergic receptor adenylate cyclase system. There was no difference in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors ([125I]-cyanopindolol) in the apical (268.6 +/- 22.7 fmol/mg protein) vs the basal (253.5 +/- 24.8 fmol/mg protein) regions. Adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by guanosine triphosphate plus isoproterenol was slightly greater in the apical (58.7 +/- 17.4%) than in the basal (49.6 +/- 10.9%) region, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = .068). Muscarinic modulation of beta-receptor coupling (oxotremorine attenuation of guanosine triphosphate plus isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity) also was not significantly different at the apical (31.6 +/- 17.5% inhibition) and basal (21.4 +/- 20.9% inhibition) sites. These data show that a transmural myocardial infarction produces denervation supersensitivity in areas apical to the infarction, but in this preparation no differences in the total number or a redistribution of beta-adrenergic receptors or adenylate cyclase activity were detected.\r"

The suction electrode catheter was actively fixed to the atrial endocardium at the His bundle level. Electrophysiologic studies were performed in the control state, immediately after, and late (greater than 40 days) after His bundle ablation and results were correlated with histologic findings in the conduction system. Unipolar His bundle recording and pacing were successfully performed in all dogs with the suction electrode catheter before and after ablation. Complete heart block developed after a single 20 J shock delivered via the suction electrode catheter in all dogs immediately, but reverted to 1:1 atrioventricular conduction with first-degree atrioventricular block in two dogs in which one or two additional shocks (20 or 30 J) produced complete heart block. Mean ablation energy per shock was 22 +/- 4 J. The mean total delivered energy per dog was 31 +/- 20 J. Late electrophysiologic study in all dogs showed persistent complete heart block in five dogs and paroxysmal second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block in two dogs. Gross examination of the ablation site showed a white plaque above the medial tricuspid leaflet (1.4 to 2.0 cm long and 0.4 to 0.6 cm wide). Microscopically, fibrosis of the penetrating and branching His bundle was seen in all dogs, with minimal atrioventricular node and atrial involvement. Significant proximal right bundle branch fibrosis was observed in the two dogs receiving one or two additional shocks. We conclude that the suction electrode catheter permits repeated His bundle recording, pacing, and ablation with a single catheter. Permanent and safe low-energy ablation of the canine His bundle is feasible. Focal injury localized to the target area in the conduction system can be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with reperfusion of ischemic myocardium were delineated with a computerized, three-dimensional mapping system, with simultaneous eight-level transmural recordings from 232 bipolar sites. In six chloralose-anesthetized cats, regional ischemia was induced for 10 min by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by reperfusion. At 10 min after ischemia, just before reperfusion, total ventricular activation time during sinus rhythm was significantly delayed (63 +/- 8 vs 25 +/- 2 msec before ischemia, p less than .001). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred within 15 sec after reperfusion and in three animals culminated in ventricular fibrillation. In 75% of cases of nonsustained VT, initiation occurred in the subendocardium, at the border of the reperfused zone via a mechanism not involving reentry, as determined by the fact that continuous activation was not apparent and the time from the end of the sinus beat to the beginning of VT (142 +/- 14 msec) was not associated with any intervening depolarizations. In the remaining 25% of cases of nonsustained VT, initiation of the VT resulted from intramural reentry in the subendocardium adjacent to the site of delayed midmyocardial activation from the preceding sinus beat (total activation time = 151 +/- 9 msec, p less than .001 vs just before reperfusion). This reentrant mechanism was similar to that responsible for the majority of cases of VT during ischemia without reperfusion. Maintenance of VT during reperfusion occurred by nonreentrant mechanisms as well as by intramural reentry, with most cases of VT involving both mechanisms. Ventricular tachycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation was initiated in the subendocardium at the border of the reperfused zone by a nonreentrant mechanism and was maintained by both nonreentrant and reentrant mechanisms, at times in combination in the same beat. The coupling interval of the first ectopic beat of VT leading to ventricular fibrillation was not significantly different from that of nonsustained VT (199 +/- 16 vs 189 +/- 9 msec, p = NS). However, during the transition from VT to ventricular fibrillation, nonreentrant mechanisms arising both in the subendocardium and subepicardium led to very rapid acceleration of the tachycardia to the coupling interval of 92 +/- 2 msec, resulting in enhanced functional block and further conduction delay, with the total activation time of the transition beats exceeding the coupling interval of the tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous amiodarone and desethylamiodarone (10 or 25 mg/kg) increased atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT) and refractory period (AVERP) in open-chest, chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Drug effects on AVCT and AVERP were greatly augmented by increasing atrial stimulation frequency. The frequency dependence of drug effects was quantified by studying the response of atrioventricular (AV) conduction to changes in coupling interval. Under control conditions, premature atrial stimulation increased AVCT with a time constant of 70 msec. In the presence of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone, a biexponential relationship between AVCT and coupling interval was observed. One component had a time constant similar to control, and a slower component with a time constant of about 1 sec appeared. Slow-channel action potentials produced in canine cardiac false tendons by elevated potassium (25 mM) and isoproterenol in vitro showed interval-dependent changes in Vmax with a time constant averaging 74 msec in the absence of amiodarone. In the presence of amiodarone, a slower recovery phase of Vmax with a time constant averaging 0.94 sec was observed. These results indicate that amiodarone and its metabolite produce heart rate-dependent changes in AV nodal function in vivo and suggest use-dependent calcium-channel blockade as a mechanism of this action. Amiodarone's rate-related effects on slow-channel properties should produce selective depression of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias involving rapid activation of the AV node.\r"

Angiography was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and animals were killed in groups of three at 1, 3, 8, and 32 weeks, for gross, light, and electronmicroscopic analysis. All dogs survived, all stents were patent, and there was no evidence of myocardial infarction, spasm, rupture, or aneurysm formation during follow-up (longest 18 months; average, 12 months). The stent was initially covered by a thin layer of thrombus that was replaced later by neointimal muscular proliferation that reached its maximal thickness by 8 weeks (p less than .01). This neointima gradually thinned as it became more sclerotic and less cellular. The stents were covered completely by immature endothelium by 1 week without loss of side branches. We conclude that balloon-expandable intraluminal stents can be safely placed percutaneously into normal canine coronary arteries. Because of rapid endothelialization high patency rates can be expected, thus offering promise for clinical applications in man.\r"

The animals underwent reperfusion for 60 min with the introduction of perfluorochemical or saline 5 to 10 min after the onset of reperfusion. Endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilatory reserve was determined in vivo both at baseline and 1 hr after reperfusion by infusion of acetylcholine and then serotonin into the distal LAD bed in 12 animals (six in each group). Both agonists significantly increased regional flow measured by 133Xe washout in the two groups before occlusion, but at 1 hr after reperfusion only animals given perfluorochemical demonstrated a significant increase in flow. Vasodilatory reserve was assessed in vitro with cumulative dose-response curves to acetylcholine on LAD rings proximal and distal to the snare in all animals. These studies demonstrated a significant reduction in endothelial cell-mediated relaxation of epicardial arterial segments in the ischemic segment of control but not treated animals. Light microscopy revealed the presence of neutrophils within vessels in the ischemic zones in control animals only. Electron microscopy showed capillary obstruction by endothelial cell protrusions and neutrophil and red cell plugging in control animals in the ischemic region but an intact endothelium and predominantly unobstructed capillaries in treated animals. These findings suggest that the structural and functional endothelial damage after reperfusion may be prevented by the administration of intracoronary perfluorochemical after the onset of reperfusion.\r"

Three months after this denudation, the area of the coronary artery was reduced by 94 +/- 2% and 43 +/- 5% (p less than .01) in the denuded and nondenuded areas by the intracoronary administration of 10 micrograms/kg histamine after pretreatment with 60 mg/kg iv cimetidine.

Administration of LTC4 or LTD4 in doses of 1 and 10 micrograms into the left coronary artery, or selectively into the left circumflex and left anterior descending coronary arteries in a dose of 5 micrograms, led to the elevations in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram and there was delayed filling of the contrast medium in the peripheral coronary artery.

  ".W": "The correct management of mucoepidermoid tumours is still debatable because of their unpredictable biological course. The issue discussed is that of identifying biological characteristics of these tumours which may have predictive value. Sixteen patients with a mucoepidermoid tumour of the parotid gland, treated at the ENT Clinic of Bologna University over a 15-year period, were reviewed. The follow-up of each patient has been related to the surgical management, in order to evaluate whether superficial parotidectomy provides adequate treatment. No prognostic differences were noted between total and superficial parotidectomy when the latter was clinically appropriate. The histopathological specimens from these patients were reviewed in an attempt to correlate the histological grade of tumour with the course of the disease. Our data suggest that histological evaluation of malignancy alone is insufficient for accurate prognosis. We think that the clinical presentation (facial nerve palsy, pain, etc.) predicts the prognosis with greater accuracy.\r"

A new approach to the assessment and evaluation of acquired neurological dysphagia is presented. Management of the first 50 patients assessed by this method is described. The advantages of a joint dysphagia clinic comprising neurology, speech therapy, ENT and radiology departments are discussed.\r"

To evaluate the safety of high-flux polysulfone dialyzers, we examined in an in vitro recirculation system whether lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipid A respectively penetrate from the dialysate to the blood compartment and vice versa using a F-60 hemofilter (Fresenius AG). For the detection of endotoxin, a sensitive, kinetic limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) microtiter test was used. It can be concluded that LPS and lipid A do not pass from either side through the filter system used when saline was recirculated for more than 10 h on both sides of the membrane.\r"

The lesion in the right kidney appeared to be congenital, whereas the etiology of the left-sided lesion could not be determined. Ablation of both fistulas effected a significant decrease in blood pressure. The angiographic appearance of a renal AV fistula often reveals its cause. These fistulas can cause significant morbidity. A review of 49 cases of congenital renal AV fistulas reveals that most are found in women and in the right kidney. Bilateral renal AV fistulas have not been previously described. Hypertension commonly develops in patients with renal AV fistulas and may resolve or improve upon fistula ablation. Improvement in blood pressure after fistula ablation occurs more frequently in traumatic fistulas than in congenital ones. Although the pathophysiology of hypertension is felt to be the shunting of the blood flow by the fistula from the renal parenchyma and subsequent stimulation of the renin system, renal vein renin sampling may be of little diagnostic value.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodynamic and humoral responses to tilting were examined in order to elucidate the autonomic nervous function in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Eleven diabetic (DM) and eleven non-diabetic (non-DM) patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment were involved in the experimentation, matching the age and the duration of hemodialysis. Cardiac output, blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EP) were measured before and 5 minutes after the 45 degree tilting. By the tilting the blood pressure significantly fell in DM, whereas it rose slightly but significantly in non-DM. In both groups, however, the heart rate remained unchanged, and either cardiac index or stroke volume index decreased equally. The percentile increase in total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) was significantly smaller in DM (14.6%) than in non-DM (27.9%). There was a significant correlation between the changes in TPRI and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.730, p less than 0.01). NE and EP increased significantly in non-DM but not in DM. Blood pressure reduced by the tilting in DM was associated with a small or equivocal response in either TPRI or plasma NE. The heart rate did not respond to the tilting in both groups. These results indicate that both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are deranged in diabetic hemodialysis patients but parasympathetic dysfunction is evident even in non-diabetic hemodialysis patients.\r"

Glomeruli usually had an increased mesangial matrix and abnormal lobulation, sometimes with vacuolar degeneration. Particularly the straight ascending, descending and Henle loop tubules showed increased epithelial degeneration and regeneration. A network of interstitial scars and a subcapsular stratum of notable cortical degeneration contributed to severe renal atrophy. Unusual intrarenal vein thickening with or without obliteration was notable. Reactive glomerular, Bowman's epithelial and convoluted tubular alterations were ascribed to a filtered toxic material with carcinogenic properties which was considered eventually responsible for renal atrophy, fibrosis and some attributes of an autoimmune reaction.\r"

In all three, rapidly progressive renal failure occurred before their 10th birthday. When comparing their evolution with data on the natural history of childhood cystinosis, no improvement was observed in terms of growth and glomerular function. It is concluded that cysteamine therapy did not provide clear benefit to the three patients reported here.\r"
