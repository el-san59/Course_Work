In recent years, alternative techniques of blind removal with balloon catheters or bougies have been advocated. This paper reports 246 esophagoscopies performed over a 19-year period to remove blunt esophageal foreign bodies. Eighty-one percent of the foreign bodies were coins and 74% were in children under 3 years of age. There were no deaths, no perforations, and no instances of mediastinitis. The only complications encountered were those due to esophageal erosion and/or respiratory problems secondary to long-standing foreign bodies. In the author's opinion, esophagoscopy is the best method for removal of all esophageal foreign bodies. There simply does not seem to be a need for alternative methods involving blind removal.\r"

Because both HpD-PT and bleomycin chemotherapy are accepted forms of treatment for squamous cell cancer and their cytotoxicity is mediated by singlet oxygen and oxygen radicals, we studied the possibility of enhancing the response of solid tumors to HpD-PT by combining this modality with systemic bleomycin chemotherapy in a murine tumor model. Bleomycin did not enhance HpD-PT significantly. Also, we are not confident that HpD-PT alone or in combination with other agents can eradicate solid tumors; it certainly did not in this syngeneic murine tumor model.\r"

Extensive stricture formation requires reconstruction to create a functional funnel system that empties below the cricoid. Esophageal replacement is not a substitute for adequate hypopharyngeal reconstruction. The pectoralis major muscle is often inadequate, because it yields too much bulk and often leads to continued aspiration. The platysma myocutaneous flap for hypopharyngeal reconstruction has not been previously reported. The inferiorly based platysma myocutaneous flap was used in two of our patients with lye burns, and bilateral superiorly based flaps were used in one. All are able to eat normally and have no significant stenosis. The platysma myocutaneous flap is a relatively simple and reliable alternative that is within the capability of every head and neck surgeon.\r"

Early invasion of the preepiglottic and paraglottic spaces can be determined accurately without altering or delaying any treatment option (open surgical excision, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy). The tendency of supraglottic cancers to transgress the natural foramina of the epiglottis is well established, and the concern about this depth of invasion is reflected by the 1977 revised staging criteria, which required assessment of the preepiglottic space (PES). Along with the microscope and the carbon dioxide laser, the adjustable supraglottiscope facilitates the determination of PES invasion and facilitates en bloc excision of superficial supraglottic cancers. The resulting morbidity typically is no different from that with routine direct endoscopy and biopsy.\r"

The eighth nerve compound action potential (CAP) threshold on day 7 after inoculation of GPCMV into the scala tympani was an average of 35 dB greater for control animals than for those that were immunosuppressed with daily intraperitoneal injections of cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg body weight). The amount of GPCMV antigen in the cochlea, detected immunohistochemically did not correlate with the CAP threshold. However, the greater the inflammatory response to GPCMV in the cochlea, the higher the CAP threshold and thus the greater the hearing loss. This study demonstrates that the inflammatory response to GPCMV may be more important than direct cytopathic effects of the virus in producing sensorineural hearing loss in GPCMV-induced labyrinthitis.\r"

All temporal bone specimens included the ET and its accessory structures, and all were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic study in a routine manner. The number of cartilage cells in the midcartilaginous portion of the ET was determined by light microscopy. In all groups, cartilage cell density of the ET decreased with increasing age. However, cell density tended to be higher at all ages for individuals with cleft palate and microtia versus controls, and tended to be lower at all ages for individuals with Down syndrome.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate the age factor in relation to EOAEs in 166 ears of subjects between 6 weeks and 83 years of age. The results show that when age increases, the presence of EOAEs by age group and the frequency peak in spectral analysis decrease, and EOAE threshold increases. Thus, there is an effect of age upon EOAEs, and it seems linked with alteration of cochlear biomechanics and/or hair cell loss. Such an effect has to be taken into consideration when EOAEs are used in clinical applications, and limits the use of EOAEs in older subjects.\r"

Implementation of this plan, however, may be limited by concerns over which skin test reactors should receive isoniazid therapy. Recent decision analyses suggest that, contrary to American Thoracic Society guidelines, asymptomatic skin test reactors under age 35 years with normal chest roentgenograms and no predisposing conditions to tuberculosis reactivation will not benefit from isoniazid chemopreventive therapy. Repeated analysis of these studies reveals that calculated life expectancy depends on estimates of the probability of certain chance outcomes. If the isoniazid-related hepatitis case-fatality rate is below 1%, isoniazid chemopreventive therapy appears to be beneficial. A literature review suggests that this rate is indeed this low. If the tuberculosis case-fatality rate is above 6.7%, also supported by the literature, the advantages of isoniazid therapy are further increased. This repeated analysis should reassure physicians that isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for tuberculin skin test reactors is beneficial to the individual and consonant with public health policies.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either clindamycin, 600 mg intravenously every 6 hours, or penicillin G, 2 million U every 4 hours for no less than 8 days, until clinical and radiological improvement became apparent. Treatment was continued orally with clindamycin, 300 mg every 6 hours, or penicillin V, 750 mg every 6 hours, until completing a minimum of 4 weeks. Ten of the 47 anaerobes initially isolated from the lung (nine Bacteroides melaninogenicus and one Bacteroides capillosus) were resistant to penicillin, but none were resistant to clindamycin. Five of the nine patients harboring these penicillin-resistant Bacteroides received penicillin, and all failed to respond to therapy. Overall, eight of the 18 patients in the penicillin group and one of 19 in the clindamycin group failed to respond to therapy. These drugs were equally well tolerated in both groups. The presence of penicillin-resistant Bacteroides is a frequent cause of penicillin failure in patients with anaerobic lung infections. In this setting, clindamycin appears to be the current therapy of choice for initial treatment.\r"

Between 1981 and 1986, a randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Seattle (Wash) Veterans Affairs Medical Center to assess the effectiveness of the following three methods of delivery of preventive services: (1) a physician-oriented model that includes education and motivation, a chart flowsheet listing recommended activities, and periodic feedback about performance; (2) a patient education model in which patients were mailed an informative brochure advising them to ask physicians for preventive services as depicted in a patient-held pocket guide; and (3) a health promotion clinic that patients were invited to attend. A control group received their usual care. A total of 1224 male outpatients were enrolled in the trial. Baseline prevention rates for 12 age-specific prevention activities were below 25%. Neither the control group rates during the 5-year trial nor the rates for the two educational models, either singly or as a combined intervention, changed. Only the health promotion clinic model was effective, tripling prevention rates in its first year and sustaining these levels for all 5 years. It is difficult to change the clinic roles of experienced physicians and their long-term patients in a specialized multiclinic setting. Providing a separate health promotion clinic option is popular with patients, bypasses gatekeeper barriers, is reasonable in cost, and warrants wider application.\r"

Vertebral mineral density was measured by quantitative computed tomography in 35 patients aged 17 to 77 years who had received therapeutic glucocorticoid drugs for 0.1 to 22 years. The mean (+/- SEM) vertebral mineral density z score in the subjects was -1.7 +/- 0.2. z score was unrelated to underlying diagnosis, sex, or age but was significantly related to the duration of previous steroid therapy (r = -.38) and to the total cumulative glucocorticoid dose (r = -.50). The rate of change of bone density in 16 of these subjects followed up over a period of 12 months was -8.9% and was significantly greater in subjects taking more than 12.5 mg of prednisone per day. Bone loss was not influenced by sex, age, duration of previous steroid treatment, or diagnosis and was not predictable from biochemical measures of calcium metabolism.\r"

Scleroderma vasculopathy and polymyositis generally occur without specificity to diffuse scleroderma, the calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia syndrome, or an overlap syndrome with arthritis. Polymyositis also occurs when the vasculopathy of scleroderma involves other organ systems.\r"

The patients were selected for study if their age was 55 years or older at the time of angiography or if they had previously undergone bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal estrogen use in 1178 patients with coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis) and 644 patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease (5% to 69% stenosis) was compared with 446 control subjects (0% stenosis) using life-table analysis. Over 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival among patients initially free of coronary lesions on arteriography who had either never used (377) or ever used (69) estrogens. Among patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis, 10-year survival of those who had never used estrogens was 85.0% and it was 95.6% among 99 \"ever users.\" Survival was 60.0% among those with more than 70% coronary stenosis who had never used estrogen and it was 97.0% among 70 ever users. The \"never users\" group were older (65 vs 59 years), had a lower proportion of cigarette smokers (40% vs 57.1%), a higher proportion of subjects with diabetes (21.7% vs 12.9%) and hyperlipidemia (58% vs 44%), and approximately equal numbers of hypertensives (56.0% vs 54.3%). Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate survival as a function of multiple covariables. Estrogen use was found to have a significant, independent effect on survival in women. We conclude that estrogen replacement after menopause prolongs survival when coronary artery disease is present, but it has less effect in the absence of coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has endorsed physician case finding as the primary method to detect individuals with elevated cholesterol levels. Despite this recommendation, promotional and for-profit public screening programs have flourished. We surveyed participants of a mall-based cholesterol screening program 1 year after their screening. Sixty-four percent of those screened had not previously known their cholesterol levels. Those who were newly screened were less likely to benefit from this testing than the general public, since they were older (mean age, 55.3 years), more likely to be female (67.4%), and nonsmokers (88%). Screenees had excellent recall of their cholesterol level (mean absolute reporting error, 0.24 mmol/L [9 mg/dL]) and a good understanding of cholesterol as a coronary heart disease risk. Those with elevated cholesterol levels reported high distress from screening but no reduction in overall psychosocial well-being and an actual decrease in absenteeism. Only 53.7% of all who were advised to seek follow-up because of an elevated screening value had done so within the year following the screening program. However, of those with values greater than 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), 68% had sought follow-up. Many of those who participate in public screening programs have been previously tested, fall into low-benefit groups, or fail to comply with recommended follow-up. We therefore conclude that cholesterol screening programs of the type now commonly offered are unlikely to contribute greatly to the national efforts to further reduce coronary heart disease.\r"

Epiglottitis occurred in significantly younger patients, all of whom were women and four of whom were previously healthy.

On further evaluation, the patients were found to have marked bladder distention associated with acute urinary retention. None of these patients complained of discomfort, and none had any awareness or recollection of their deterioration. Each patient had rapid resolution of symptoms on bladder decompression. To our knowledge, this \"cystocerebral syndrome\" has not been previously described, and we suggest that it be considered in the evaluation of acute confusional states in elderly men.\r"

Based on the markedly increased frequency in which lymphomatoid granulomatosis is being diagnosed at our institution in the post-human immunodeficiency virus era, we postulated an association between these two entities.\r"

A five-cell design was used to determine whether a maintenance form of interpersonal psychotherapy alone or in combination with medication could play a significant role in the prevention of recurrence. A second question was whether maintaining antidepressant medication at the dosage used to treat the acute episode rather than decreasing to a \"maintenance\" dosage would provide prophylaxis superior to that observed in earlier trials in which a maintenance dosage strategy was employed. Survival analysis demonstrated a highly significant prophylactic effect for active imipramine hydrochloride maintained at an average dose of 200 mg and a modest prophylactic effect for monthly interpersonal psychotherapy. We conclude that active imipramine hydrochloride maintained at an average dose of 200 mg is an effective means of preventing recurrence and that monthly interpersonal psychotherapy serves to lengthen the time between episodes in patients not receiving active medication.\r"

Computerized techniques, including amplitude frequency measures and spectral analyses, are permitting new approaches to the examination of delta sleep. Early studies suggested that many depressed patients demonstrate lower delta wave intensity during the first non-rapid eye movement period than the second one. This finding, prominent in middle-aged depressed patients, has led to an examination of the ratio between the first and second non-rapid eye movement periods. This delta sleep measure seems to be a more robust predictor of recurrence than rapid eye movement latency. Analysis of data on 74 patients in a long-term maintenance treatment study for a minimum of 24 months demonstrates that the delta sleep ratio can predict survival time following discontinuation of drug treatment. Individuals with a high delta sleep ratio remain clinically remitted five times longer than those with a low delta sleep ratio.\r"

Stability of recall was good for substance abuse and conduct disorder. Stability of recall was generally poor for anxiety disorder, regardless of subtype. For all major disorders except anxiety disorder, the difference in reported age at onset between the two interviews was small (less than 1 year) and not statistically significant. The most important correlates of stability of reports of major depression were previous psychiatric treatment and dysthymia and poor social functioning at the initial interview.

Compared with control subjects, both patient groups maintained a higher amount of REM sleep time and REM activity during RSD. Unexpectedly, depressed patients showed little rebound in visually scored or automated REM sleep measures following RSD, and they showed stability of REM activity temporal distribution from baseline to recovery conditions. This contrasted with the rebound in REM sleep activity seen in control subjects, and the more modest increase in demented patients. The RSD was fairly specific, with some impact on delta sleep during the procedure but not during recovery sleep. Mood ratings were unaffected by RSD. These findings demonstrated a greater plasticity of REM sleep regulation in the healthy elderly control subjects and suggested a higher REM \"pressure\" with a \"ceiling effect\" in depressed patients. Patients with dementia appeared to have an impaired capacity to respond to the challenge of RSD.\r"

No statistically significant differences were found between women with premenstrual syndrome and normal controls for melatonin onset or peak concentration, or for estradiol or progesterone levels. The data demonstrate that women with premenstrual syndrome have chronobiological abnormalities of melatonin secretion. The fact that these patients respond to treatments that affect circadian physiology, such as sleep deprivation and phototherapy, suggests that circadian abnormalities may contribute to the pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome.\r"

Pancreatic injuries with ductal disruption occurred in 18 patients and were treated by pancreatic resection. Abscesses developed in seven (39%) of the patients, but no late deaths occurred. Nineteen patients had duodenal injuries without pancreatic injury, and no duodenal complications occurred. Simple closure sufficed for injuries affecting up to 40% of the duodenal circumference. Wounds affecting up to 40% of the duodenal circumference can be treated by suture closure alone. Adjunctive duodenal tube decompression should be reserved for wounds affecting greater than 40% of the duodenal circumference, closure under tension, and associated injuries to the head of the pancreas. Pyloric exclusion was rarely necessary in our patients.\r"

This led us to speculate that high-frequency jet ventilation might reduce barotrauma by providing alveolar ventilation at lower airway pressures. We describe a group of patients in whom a high incidence of barotrauma was observed after institution of high-frequency jet ventilation despite reduction in measured airway pressures. Fifteen hypoxic patients who could not be treated with conventional ventilation and who had no roentgenographic evidence of barotrauma were entered into the study. Airway pressures were measured during conventional ventilation and at 2 and 24 hours after high-frequency jet ventilation. Despite significant reduction in peak inspiratory and mean airway pressures, pneumothorax developed in seven of the 15 patients, an average of 21 hours after initiation of high-frequency jet ventilation. Five patients had bilateral pneumothorax and three developed tension pneumothorax. Despite reductions in proximal airway pressures, barotrauma is a significant potential complication of high-frequency jet ventilation in patients with noncompliant lungs. We currently place bilateral prophylactic thoracostomy tubes in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome prior to initiation of high-frequency jet ventilation.\r"

We describe the role of cholecystokinin and the benefits of cholecystokinin receptor blockade in this form of pancreatitis. A cholinergic mimetic (carbachol) was administered to rats weighing 300 to 350 g and produced a form of edematous pancreatitis that mimics that seen in humans. Animals received carbachol intraperitoneally, either alone (250 micrograms/kg of body weight) or with cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist devazepide (3 mg/kg of body weight) and were killed 4 hours later. Carbachol administration resulted in a 19% increase in pancreatic weight, a fourfold increase in serum amylase levels, and a 14-fold increase in serum lipase levels. Plasma cholecystokinin levels, however, were not altered. Devazepide administered prior to cholinergic hyperstimulation blocked pancreatic weight increase and reduced elevations in serum amylase levels twofold and lipase levels fourfold. Although cholecystokinin levels are not elevated in this model of pancreatitis, blockade of even low, background concentrations of this regulatory peptide is beneficial.\r"

Recently it has been suggested that successful percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections may serve as definitive therapy. We undertook therapeutic, computed tomography-directed percutaneous drainage in a selected group of 29 patients with infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Twenty-three patients (79%) were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage. Of six patients (21%) representing failures of percutaneous drainage, four died and two recovered after operative drainage. The four patients who died had a mean APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score of 23 and five of Ranson's prognostic signs. Ranson's signs and APACHE II scores were predictive of success and mortality. We conclude that in selected patients, infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections can be treated definitively with therapeutic percutaneous catheter drainage. Based on this experience, recommendations regarding patient selection are included.\r"

Control rats were fed a liquid diet, with 36% of their energy provided by maltose-dextrin for 28 days, and the remaining two groups of rats were fed an equivalent proportion of their energy as alcohol for 28 days or 18 months. Alcohol-fed rats exhaled significantly greater quantities of ethane than did controls at 28 days and 18 months. Serum cholesterol levels increased by 40% and triglyceride levels increased by 80%, but phospholipid levels remained unchanged in alcohol-fed rats compared with controls. Aortic concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids increased twofold and threefold, respectively, in alcohol-fed rats, with a corresponding alteration of the cholesterol-phospholipid ratio at both time intervals. Tissue triglyceride levels were only elevated at 28 days, and no differences in aortic lipid peroxide levels were detected between alcohol-fed rats and controls. The results of the study indicate that alcohol ingestion increases aortic cholesterol, phospholipid, and triglyceride levels at 28 days and cholesterol and phospholipid but not triglyceride levels at 18 months. The mechanisms underlying the accumulation of lipids in aortic tissue need further elucidation.\r"

When administered to the basolateral surface, neuropeptide Y is found to decrease basal short-circuit current. Neuropeptide Y inhibits vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated increases in short-circuit current in a concentration-dependent fashion by a tetrodotoxin-insensitive mechanism. Also, neuropeptide Y inhibited increases in short-circuit current produced by direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. Furthermore, neuropeptide Y prevents vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated increases in tissue cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. These results indicate that neuropeptide Y administered to the basolateral membrane inhibits vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated short-circuit current changes by a tetrodotoxin-insensitive mechanism that decreases tissue levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.\r"

Creatinine clearance, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease were all found to be independently associated with formation of foot lesions, indicating that each of these acts by distinct biologic mechanisms. Renal function had no bearing on the severity of lesions or on their eventual healing. We conclude that foot ulcers are more likely to develop in diabetic patients who also suffer from renal impairment, but they are no less likely to heal than are those in patients with normal renal function. We further conclude that attempts to preserve functional limbs in these patients are justified.\r"

We studied 18 rats prepared with jugular vein catheters. The following agents were administered intravenously to groups of four rats for 6 hours: 1 mL/h (control) crystalloid solution; 1-microgram/kg bolus then 1 microgram/kg per hour of octreotide; and 5 micrograms/kg per hour of cerulein; also, in a fourth group of six rats, octreotide and cerulein were administered simultaneously. At the end of experiments, blood was drawn for plasma amylase determinations; rats were killed and pancreata were examined. Supramaximal cerulein administration to conscious rats induced hyperamylasemia and edematous pancreatitis, confirming previous observations; in both groups of rats receiving cerulein, there was prominent interstitial edema, acinar vacuolization, and mild-to-moderate acute inflammation. While octreotide pretreatment of rats with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was associated with a lesser increase of wet pancreas weight and plasma amylase concentration, there was little overall benefit of octreotide pretreatment in this form of experimental acute pancreatitis.\r"

Passive venous filling time with elevation and 90% venous refilling time after muscle contraction were calculated. From immediately after through 14 weeks after valve lysis, a shortened venous filling time and 90% venous refilling time as well as an elevated poststimulation venous pressure were noted. This valve lysis method successfully produced a hemodynamically verified model of venous valvular insufficiency.\r"

All of our extrapancreatic gastrinomas have been located to the right. These observations prompted us to determine if other extrapancreatic gastrinomas were also predominantly located to the right side. We searched the world's literature and found 10 cases of ovarian gastrinomas and one case of a renal gastrinoma. Nine of these remote extrapancreatic gastrinomas were located on the right side. This distribution of remote extrapancreatic gastrinomas is similar to our experience with peripancreatic gastrinomas.

Fusion frequency and the number of tumor-reactive clones were markedly increased when the in vitro immunization protocol was applied prior to fusion. As a stimulant in in vitro immunization, the supernatant of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes was superior to the supernatant of mixed lymphocytes culture. Carcinoembryonic antigen at 20 micrograms/L seemed to be the optimal dose for in vitro immunization. The reactivities of human monoclonal antibodies thus generated were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoperoxidase staining. Combining in vitro immunization with lymphocytes of cancer patients may lead to the successful production of clinically useful human monoclonal antibodies.\r"

Bile from patients with gallstone disease was less concentrated, with decreased sodium, bile salt, and phospholipid concentrations, but elevated biliary calcium concentrations were not observed. The relationship between free ionized calcium and total calcium was similar in all groups, indicating no difference in calcium binding by gallstone-containing bile. We cannot exclude elevated biliary calcium level as a factor in gallstone pathogenesis, as it could be a transient event. The importance of calcium precipitation was supported by our finding that more than half of the samples were saturated or supersaturated with at least one calcium salt, calcium carbonate.\r"

Thirty-nine 1-, 2-, and 3-mm hemispheric, distally based intimal flaps were made in 4- to 5-mm diameter canine femoral and carotid arteries. Twenty arteries had 2- and 3-mm intimal flaps and were monitored for short-term arterial thrombosis and flap extension. Nineteen had 1- and 2-mm intimal flaps and were monitored for thrombosis, long-term development of neointimal hyperplasia, arterial stenosis, and persistence of the flap. While 40% of the arteries with 3-mm intimal flaps developed thrombosis in 3 to 5 days, only 3% of the arteries with 1- or 2-mm intimal flaps developed thrombosis. Most 1- to 2-mm intimal flaps resolved and the subsequent development of neointimal hyperplasia or arterial stenosis was minimal. Arteries with hemodynamically significant stenoses from intimal flaps warrant repair, while arteries with smaller intimal flaps may not require repair.\r"

  ".W": "Intestinal regeneration in patched intestinal defects is enhanced by both intestinal resection and urogastrone. Our aim was to determine if these two stimuli have synergistic effects. Ileal defects were patched with colon serosa in 45 rabbits. Group 1 (n = 11) were control subjects; group 2 (n = 12) underwent 50% intestinal resection; group 3 (n = 11) received urogastrone (1.5 micrograms/kg per hour subcutaneously); and group 4 (n = 11) underwent intestinal resection and received urogastrone. Animals were killed at 7 and 14 days. Intestinal resection had the greater effect on epithelialization. Urogastrone inhibited contraction and intestinal resection did not. Both intestinal resection and urogastrone increased proliferative activity. Combining intestinal resection and urogastrone did not have a synergistic effect on epithelialization and diminished the effect of urogastrone on proliferation and contraction. These findings suggest that intestinal resection and urogastrone stimulate epithelialization via similar mechanisms and that urogastrone would not enhance regeneration during intestinal adaptation.\r"

Canine jugular vein factor VIII-positive endothelial cells in passages 3 through 6 were incubated with 111Indium-oxine, and labeled cells were seeded onto fibronectin-treated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patches. Patches with confluent cells were exposed to shear in a Weissenberg rheogoniometer for intervals ranging up to 60 minutes. Percent endothelial cell retention was determined by gamma counting of patches and media and by histologic evaluation. Prostacyclin production (tritiated radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) was assayed on perfusing media. Results showed no differences in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha production between shear rates or time periods. Endothelial cell retention did not differ between the shear rates. Rotational shear caused persistent cell loss over time in either high- or low-shear conditions. This persistent cell loss in response to steady rotational shear differs from that in response to identical rates of pulsatile linear shear in our laboratory where cell loss approached zero after 15 minutes.\r"

The predisposing factors in the latter group are recurrent peritonitis, presence of acetate in the dialysate, and antiseptics used during bag exchanges. We report a case of SEP following chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and review the literature on this benign yet potentially lethal condition. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis frequently leads to intestinal obstruction, small-bowel necrosis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and malnutrition. There is a high incidence of anastomotic failure when a resection and primary intestinal anastomosis is performed in patients with SEP. Although SEP is not commonly reported in the surgical literature, its importance to surgeons is indicated by the fact that the overall mortality rate is close to 60% in patients with SEP who develop surgical complications.\r"

To determine whether previous medical therapy influences the outcome of subsequent trabeculectomy, we retrospectively reviewed the results of surgery in two groups of patients. The first group underwent primary trabeculectomy, having had an average of 2 weeks of preoperative medical therapy, and this group was compared with a group of patients who had received at least 1 year of topical glaucoma therapy before undergoing trabeculectomy (the multiple-treatment group). The two groups were similar in terms of a number of variables, including race, age, sex, presenting intraocular pressures, and presenting visual fields, and they differed only in the known duration of their disease. The success rate of trabeculectomy was significantly higher in the primary trabeculectomy group as compared with that in the multiple-treatment group (P less than .001). We discuss the possible reasons for this difference and its implications for the future management of primary open angle glaucoma.\r"

In 27 eyes, the anterior chamber was re-formed at the completion of surgery with balanced salt solution, and in eight eyes it was reformed with hyaluronate sodium. A total of six eyes (17%) had an IOP of 40 mm Hg or greater 4 to 6 hours after surgery. Patients who received hyaluronate to maintain the depth of the anterior chamber had a significantly greater chance of experiencing a marked postoperative IOP rise, both at 4 to 6 hours (P = .005) and on the first postoperative day (P = .0038). There was no correlation between the postoperative IOP rise and the patient's age, sex, glaucoma diagnosis, preoperative IOP, use of 5-fluorouracil, or the number of sutures used to close the scleral flap. Hyaluronate may contribute to an early increase in IOP that could result in further visual field loss in eyes with severe glaucomatous damage. We recommend early monitoring of IOP after trabeculectomy and avoiding the routine use of hyaluronate.\r"

Eighty eyes were tested and divided into four diagnostic categories: background diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, and normal. The recovery times for the eyes with age-related macular degeneration were longer than for eyes with macular edema (P = .03). Age-matched patients with age-related macular degeneration had longer recovery times than did those without age-related macular degeneration (P = .0001). A possible explanation is that the prolonged recovery time in the eyes with age-related macular degeneration reflects that the anatomic lesion is located in the retinal pigment epithelium-photoreceptor complex. In comparison, the eyes with macular edema, whose lesion is in the inner retina and not the retinal pigment epithelium, show a less-prolonged recovery time than the eyes with age-related macular degeneration.\r"

The final success rates were the same (95%), regardless of which approach was selected as an initial technique. The patients whose initial transvitreal reattachment failed and who underwent additional transvitreal procedures (including macular laser photocoagulation) showed a success rate of 93%. We believe that gas tamponade, which has possibility of better visual prognosis, should be selected as an initial technique because the final success rate was found to be the same regardless of the initial surgical techniques.\r"

On both coronal and sagittal images, hypoplastic optic nerves were thin and demonstrated signal attenuation when compared with normal optic nerves. All patients with severe bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia also had diffuse chiasmal hypoplasia, which was seen best on coronal images. Patients with unilateral or asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia had variable chiasmal abnormalities. The degree to which the magnetic resonance diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia matched the clinical diagnosis was highly significant (P less than .001, Fisher's Exact Test) for both coronal and sagittal views of the intracranial optic nerves. Oblique axial and coronal views of the orbital optic nerves did not reliably distinguish optic nerve hypoplasia from normal optic nerves. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging is a useful diagnostic modality to identify small optic nerves neuroradiologically.\r"

Peak saccadic velocities were decreased in those patients who developed or presented with optic neuropathy. This effect was more pronounced for larger eye movements. Peak saccadic velocity also decreased as total extraocular muscle volume and limitation of ocular motility increased. For any given extraocular muscle volume, peak saccadic velocity was 40 degrees/s slower in patients 40 years or older than in younger patients. The relationship between velocity and motility limitation was most pronounced for intermediate muscle volumes (8% to 15% of total orbital volume). Saccadic velocities in those patients with optic nerve compression often improved following treatment. This study demonstrated that eye movement recording was a useful adjunct in evaluation of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Furthermore, age-related lowering of peak saccadic velocities implicated changes of extraocular muscle structure as a factor in the development of optic neuropathy.\r"

Both the geometric mean titer of IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen and the proportion with high titers of IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen (greater than or equal to 1:640) were significantly higher in 12 seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome than in 12 seropositive controls (1/761:1/202, P = .001; 83.3%:8.3%, P less than .001). Ten of 12 seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and five of 12 seropositive controls had antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigens (greater than or equal to 1:10) (Fisher's Exact Test, P less than .05), while four seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and one seropositive control had low to undetectable levels of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen (less than or equal to 1:5) (P greater than .1). Antibody levels to cytomegalovirus or measles virus were not different between patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and controls. Additional studies showed no evidence of humoral immune disorder or collagen vascular disease in the patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. The serologic profiles suggest that the patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome examined had a cellular immune abnormality sufficient to permit reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection and imply, but do not establish, a role for Epstein-Barr virus infection in the pathogenesis of some cases of the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome.\r"

In five Swedish patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy we diagnosed homozygosity for the TTR met-30 gene using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The homozygous individuals did not show more severe systemic symptoms or earlier onset than heterozygotes for the TTR met-30 gene. The only clinical difference was the presence of vitreous opacities in all homozygous patients.\r"

The ablated surface had reepithelialized and the synthesis of type VII collagen (a major component of anchoring fibrils) was evident by 7 days; the reestablishment of a nearly continuous anchoring fibril zone was evident after 12 weeks. Stromal fibroblasts, activated in response to wounding, expressed a fetal antigen for approximately 6 weeks. Although fibronectin and type VII collagen were present only transiently in the regenerating subepithelial stromal matrix in the subepithelial regions, some other alterations, including the presence of type III collagen, increased levels of keratan sulfates, and discontinuities in the anchoring fibril zone were evident even 18 months after wounding. The depths of the regenerated stroma, which were estimated from the depths of remnant staining for type VII collagen in the stromal matrix, generally, but not always, corresponded to the depths of the calculated ablation.\r"

The absorption of these materials as considerably different for the two wavelengths; we found that 308-nm light experienced much less absorption than the 193-nm light. The extinction coefficient (k) for 308 nm was k = 0.19/cm for balanced salt solution and k = 0.22/cm for sodium hyaluronate. In contrast to this, the extinction coefficient for 193 nm was k = 140/cm for balanced salt solution and k = 540/cm for sodium hyaluronate. Two 1-day-old human phakic cadaver eyes showed complete absorption with both wavelengths. Using aphakic eyes, incomplete absorption was noted at the posterior pole with 308 nm and complete absorption was noted with 193 nm. The extinction in the anterior part of aphakic eyes (the first 6 mm) was 4.2/cm for 308 nm, meaning that the intensity of the light is reduced by a factor of 10 after traveling the first 5.5 mm. However, we observed that the material in the eye fluoresces, meaning the 308 nm is transformed into other (longer) wavelengths that travel through the total eye with minimal absorption. Conclusions drawn from this experiment are that the use of the 308-nm wavelength may have undesirable side effects, while the use of the 193-nm wavelength should be consistent with ophthalmic use on both the cornea and the lens.\r"

  ".W": "The association of reactive oxygen species to altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier in acute experimental encephalomyelitis was investigated by ultrastructural cytochemical localization of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to sites in the optic nerve previously identified by extravasation of intravascular horseradish peroxidase. Using a modified cerium method, we found electron-dense cerium-derived H2O2 reaction product was localized to the perivascular space at the lamina retinalis, lamina choroidalis, and lamina scleralis. In the optic nerve head, electron-dense reaction product was observed in the presence of intravascular leukocytes, although adjacent perivascular and interstitial inflammatory cells at this site were scant. In the myelinated retrobulbar optic nerve, cerium-derived H2O2 reaction product was seen in the intravascular space of blood vessels and surrounding perivascular and interstitial foci of inflammatory cells. Reaction product was also observed in the extracellular space adjacent to the plasmalemma of axons and glial cells in the optic nerve head and retrobulbar nerve. The perivascular and intravascular distribution of cerium-derived reaction product suggests that H2O2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of altered vascular permeability in experimental optic neuritis and supports our previous observations of suppression of blood-brain barrier permeability by detoxification of H2O2 with the exogenous administration of antioxidant enzymes.\r"

Ocular rigidity was determined in 14 donor eyes by injecting small increments of a balanced salt solution through the limbus, while continually monitoring the intraocular pressure with a transducer. A buckling procedure was then performed in these eyes with the use of various solid silicone or stainless steel encircling elements, and the experiments were repeated. Buckled eyes were significantly less rigid than unbuckled eyes, and eyes with higher buckles were significantly less rigid than those with shallower buckles. The observed changes in rigidity are likely secondary to changes in the shape and stress distribution of the scleral shell and are only to a small degree related to the elasticity of the encircling element. Greater volumes of vitreous substitutes, gases, or antibiotics may be injected into buckled eyes compared with unbuckled eyes before excessive intraocular pressures are reached.\r"

  ".W": "Severe unilateral ptosis with poor levator function has previously been treated with maximal levator muscle resection or bilateral or unilateral frontalis suspension. One of us (R.L.A.) has developed a technique called \"Whitnall's sling,\" where only the levator aponeurosis is resected, preserving Whitnall's ligament and its attachments. Whitnall's ligament and the underlying resected levator muscle are sutured to the superior portion of the tarsal plate. This surgery preserves levator muscle, Muller's muscle, and Whitnall's ligament without altering the structures that produce the three-layer tear film. In 69 eyelids operated on between July 1976 and July 1986, in which a minimum of 1 year of follow-up by one of use was obtained, results have been satisfactory and directly related to levator function. We believe this technique to be anatomically and physiologically superior to \"maximal levator resection\" with similar long-term results. More recent results have shown that the addition of a 5-mm superior tarsectomy provides an additional elevation of 1 to 1.5 mm. Whitnall's sling is best suited for cases where the opposite fissure height is 9 mm or less and levator function of the ptotic eyelid is 3 to 5 mm.\r"

Both systolic (percentage area reduction and ejection fraction of the ischemic segment) and diastolic (early to atrial peak flow ratio and time velocity integral) function parameters and end-systolic wall stress changed significantly during PTCA. These changes were most profound during PTCA of the left anterior descending artery than they were during PTCA of the right coronary artery. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction are therefore invariably linked during transient ischemia, and PTCA of the left anterior descending artery consistently produced more profound dysfunction.\r"

In all but one patient the balloon dilation of the mitral valve was successful and Doppler-derived valve area increased (0.9 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.4 cm2). Transesophageal echocardiography provides continuous monitoring, as well as guidance of the procedure. Crossing the arterial septum, as well as delivery of the sheath through the mitral valve orifice and correct positioning of the balloon, was highly facilitated and reduced x-ray exposure time. The degree of mitral regurgitation and the presence of interatrial shunting at the end of the procedure could be readily assessed, making cineangiography not necessary. Complications of the procedure, such as pericardial effusion, could be detected before hemodynamic deterioration had occurred (one patient). The advantages of transesophageal echocardiography for routine monitoring of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, however, should be weighted against the added risk and expense of this support.\r"

Introduction of the transesophageal probe was successful in 26 patients (93%); children were studied with use of dedicated pediatric transducers. Epicardial studies were performed in all 28 patients. Epicardial studies allowed for higher resolution imaging and a more complete assessment before bypass surgery of the intracardiac morphological condition (ventricular septum and right ventricular outflow tract) than the assessment that was obtained by the transesophageal approach. In the period immediately after bypass surgery, the transesophageal technique allowed a more detailed insight into atrioventricular valve function (valvar regurgitation [five patients] and ventricular inflow patterns) and the continuous monitoring of left ventricular function and volume. Residual interventricular shunting (three patients) or residual outflow tract obstruction (four patients) could not be reliably documented by transesophageal studies. It is concluded that intraoperative transesophageal and epicardial ultrasound in surgery for congenital heart disease are complementary rather than alternative techniques.\r"

Prevalence was measured by previous history, Rose chest pain questionnaire, and the Minnesota code of a 12 lead resting electrocardiogram. The prevalence of coronary heart disease in Scotland was high compared with studies from other countries that used the same standardised methods. A history of angina was more common in men (5.5%) than in women (3.9%), though in response to the Rose questionnaire 8.5% of women and 6.3% of men reported chest pain. A history of myocardial infarction was three times more common in men than women, as was a Q/QS pattern on the electrocardiogram. There were significant correlations between the different measures of coronary prevalence. District measures of angina correlated well with mortality from coronary heart disease, and these correlations tended to be stronger in women than in men. There was no significant correlation between mortality from coronary heart disease and measures of myocardial infarction. The study provides data on the prevalence of coronary heart disease in men and women that are valuable for the planning of cardiological services.\r"

Transient ST segment depression was much commoner during late (32% patients) than early (14%) monitoring. Most transient ischaemia (greater than 85% episodes) was silent and 80% of patients had only silent episodes. During late monitoring painful ST depression was accompanied by greater ST depression and tended to occur at a higher heart rate. Late transient ischaemia showed a diurnal distribution, occurred at a higher initial heart rate, and was more often accompanied by a further increase in heart rate than early ischaemia. Thus in the first 2 months after myocardial infarction transient ischaemia became increasingly common and more closely associated with increased myocardial oxygen demand. Because transient ischaemic episodes during early and late ambulatory monitoring have dissimilar characteristics they may also have different pathophysiologies and prognostic implications.\r"

A new protocol was devised that starts at a low workload and increases by 15% of the previous workload every minute. This is the first protocol to be based on exponential rather than linear increments in workload. The new protocol (standardised exponential exercise protocol, STEEP) is suitable for use on either a treadmill or a bicycle ergometer. This protocol was compared with standard protocols in 30 healthy male volunteers, each of whom performed four exercise tests: the STEEP treadmill and bicycle protocols, a modified Bruce treadmill protocol, and a 20 W/min bicycle protocol. During the two STEEP tests the subjects' oxygen consumption rose gradually and exponentially and there was close agreement between the bicycle and the treadmill protocols. A higher proportion of subjects completed the treadmill than the bicycle protocol. Submaximal heart rates were slightly higher during the bicycle test. The STEEP protocol took less time than the modified Bruce treadmill protocol, which tended to produce plateaux in oxygen consumption during the early stages. The 20 W/min bicycle protocol does not take account of subjects' body weight and consequently produced large intersubject variability in oxygen consumption. The STEEP protocol can be used on either a treadmill or a bicycle ergometer and it should be suitable for a wide range of patients.\r"

From 31 December 1984 to 31 December 1988, 27 of these patients underwent subsequent surgical correction. Age at operation ranged from 7 to 58 months (median 2.7 years). The mean interval between balloon dilatation and correction was 15.6 months (range 3-39 months). Two patients had a systemic pulmonary shunt operation performed before dilatation and a further five required one afterwards. Overall 20 (74%) patients had some anatomical alteration as the result of balloon dilatation, while in seven (26%) there was no discernible change in the right ventricular outflow tract. There was no consistent relation between the ratio of balloon size to pulmonary annulus diameter and the morphological findings. Balloon dilatation may obviate the need for systemic-pulmonary shunt at the expense of some structural damage, particularly to the posterior cusp. The present data suggest that dilatation does not bring about growth of the annulus to such an extent that transannular patch is no longer needed at intracardiac repair.\r"

Three patients had totally anomalous connections (one supracardiac, one direct to coronary sinus, and one mixed supracardiac and infracardiac) and four patients had partially anomalous pulmonary venous connections. All patients presented with the clinical features of tetralogy of Fallot. Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was suspected clinically in only one patient in whom there was a scimitar sign on the chest radiograph. The exact diagnosis was established by cross sectional echocardiography (one), preoperative or postoperative angiography (five), or at necropsy (one). Surgery was performed in six patients. Total correction without re-routing of the anomalously draining veins was successful in all those with partially anomalous connections, with no significant long term sequelae (follow up median 17 years). Of those with totally anomalous connections, the full diagnosis was made only at necropsy in one patient, successful one-stage correction was performed in one, and the other patient, who had partially obstructed mixed drainage, died shortly after one-stage correction. Histological examination of the lung biopsy specimen in this patient showed grade 2 pulmonary vascular disease. Tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous pulmonary venous connections is a rare association. Careful preoperative assessment is required in those with totally anomalous connections.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the diagnostic criteria for a sinus venosus atrial septal defect cross sectional echocardiograms, cineangiograms, and surgical notes of all patients with this diagnosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. Seven patients were identified. In each the extent of the atrial septum and the nature of the junction of the superior vena cava with the atria were evaluated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. All had overriding of the superior vena cava and abnormally connected right pulmonary veins. Six patients had undergone cardiac catheterisation and cineangiography. Five patients underwent surgical repair. The operative findings were consistent with the expected morphology in all five, and these features were additionally confirmed in a specimen from the cardiopathological museum. Therefore, the basic anatomical feature of a superior sinus venosus interatrial communication is a biatrial connection of the superior vena cava. This, together with anomalous drainage of the right sided pulmonary veins, results in an interatrial communication outside the confines of the true atrial septum. Overriding of the superior vena cava across the upper rim of the oval fossa is suggested as the pathognomonic diagnostic feature that can clearly be demonstrated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. In essence the lesion is an interatrial communication rather than an atrial septal defect.\r"

One aneurysm was found in an intercostal artery in a 19 year old man and the other was a false aneurysm just distal to the coarctation site in a 7 year old boy. These aneurysms are fragile, apt to rupture, and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Though local factors such as jet streams and bacterial endocarditis may influence their formation there must be an underlying generalised weakness in the arterial wall. A coarctation should not be regarded as an isolated arterial abnormality because it may be a feature of a more generalised disease. Because of the risk of rupture, which may not be prevented by antihypertensive treatment, operation should not be delayed in any age group.\r"

The procedure was unsuccessful in three patients. After balloon dilatation the left atrial pressure decreased from 22 mm Hg to 13 mm Hg and the mitral valve gradient from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. The mitral valve area increased from 0.7 cm2 to 2.1 cm2. Exercise time on the standard Bruce protocol increased from 3.9 minutes to 7.2 minutes. In 22 (44%) patients mitral regurgitation developed or the grade of regurgitation increased. Left to right shunts with pulmonary to systemic flow ratios greater than 1:5 were detected in four patients. Transient cerebrovascular episodes developed in two patients. One patient died after emergency valve replacement for severe mitral regurgitation. Balloon dilatation of the mitral valve by the single catheter technique with the bifoil or trefoil catheters is an effective treatment for patients with mitral stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation is a frequent complication of the procedure.\r"

The diagnosis was based on clinical and genealogical data, was confirmed in 3 patients at autopsy and in 2 others by biopsy. Focal neurological signs, and at least some degree of global cognitive deterioration, were observed in all patients, with unequivocal dementia in 4. MRI showed haemorrhages and areas of gliosis and, to a variable extent, hyperintensity of the white matter in T2-weighted images. Neuropathological examination revealed a large recent haemorrhage together with residual lesions from previous haemorrhages or infarcts in all patients examined. The white matter lesions, present on MRI, turned out to be areas of 'incomplete infarction' with demyelination. It is concluded that (hereditary) amyloid angiopathy can lead to strokes, but also to subcortical ischaemic encephalopathy. Amyloid angiopathy should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of white matter lesions, found on CT or MRI, especially when patients present with a cerebral haemorrhage. The relationship between HCHWA-D and Alzheimer's disease, another disease with cerebral amyloid deposition and diffuse white matter involvement, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebrospinal fluid and serum immunoglobulin G from 1007 patients with suspected neurological disease were analysed by 2 methods: isoelectric focusing for the detection of oligoclonal banding, and quantitative measurement of IgG and albumin for the formulation of a Log IgG-Index. A comparison of the 2 methods in the detection of local synthesis of IgG showed that isoelectric focusing not only gave a much higher yield overall, with 282 patients showing local synthesis versus 225 for the Log IgG-Index, but also a higher specificity, with a false positive rate of 0% versus 3.5%. In addition, of the 282 patients positive by isoelectric focusing only 163 (58%) were positive by the Log IgG-Index. Of the 1007 patients studied, 206 had multiple sclerosis (MS), and isoelectric focusing showed local synthesis in 95% of clinically definite cases, with a 90% detection rate overall. The Log IgG-Index was positive in only 67% of clinically definite cases, with an overall 59% detection rate. Thus with the exceptions noted above, local synthesis of IgG as defined by isoelectric focusing is confined to demyelinating, inflammatory, infectious and postinfectious disorders. Our results compare very favourably with the published sensitivities of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of abnormalities in multiple sclerosis, and better than those for evoked potentials. Where both these investigations are readily available isoelectric focusing provides a useful adjunct. For the majority of physicians and neurologists who do not have ready access to magnetic resonance imaging, isoelectric focusing is an excellent alternative. We would also recommend that it become the standard for the measurement of IgG abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid and that the use of quantitative data be abandoned for routine purposes.\r"

This newly recognized form of congenital myasthenia with distinctive ethnic clustering and associated facial malformations is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder. The facial abnormalities may be secondary to the neuromuscular defect or may be primary and unrelated. Further studies are needed to elucidate the defect in neuromuscular transmission responsible for the pathogenesis of this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Unexplained spastic myelopathy in black (Zulu) patients, similar to that seen in the tropics, has previously been described from Natal, South Africa. Following reports linking the human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) to spastic myelopathy, we undertook a prospective and retrospective search for HTLV-I antibodies in 36 patients who were labelled as having unexplained myelopathy; 24 (66%) were positive and HTLV-I was isolated from 4 out of the 6 patients whose peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured. Eighteen (75%) gave a short history (less than 6 months). There was a female preponderance (71%), spinothalamic dysfunction was common (55%) and as many as half were severely disabled (50% wheelchair bound). Routine laboratory studies showed no specific trends apart from hypergammaglobulinaemia and CSF pleocytosis (greater than 5 cells/microliter in 66% of patients). The total CSF protein was raised (greater than 0.4 g/l) in 45% of patients. The IgG index was greater than 0.7 in 15 of 19 patients. Conventional myelography did not show any specific abnormalities. Computer assisted myelography was undertaken in 22 patients; 3 showed arachnoiditis and 2 spinal cord atrophy. Periventricular lucencies were seen in 1 of 10 patients who had computed tomography of the head. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated abnormalities in 46% of the patients indicating that subclinical peripheral nerve dysfunction was common. Visual evoked responses were abnormal in only 1 patient but brainstem auditory evoked response studies showed some abnormality in 42% of the patients. The finding of HTLV-I antibodies in a significant number, and the isolation of HTLV-I from the blood in 6 of our black patients with noncompressive myelopathy, represents a substantial clinical advance. Future studies should define more clearly the role of the virus in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Six patients with a slowly progressive aphasic disorder due to degenerative cortical disease are reported. The length of history varied from 18 months to 6 years. In 5 patients, there was a naming deficit, associated in 4 of these with some abnormalities in comprehension. One patient had a progressive history of reduced speech output, which was associated with an orofacial dyspraxia. All patients were studied neuropsychologically, and in addition regional cerebral metabolism was measured using position emission tomography. A localized left hemisphere deficit was found in all patients except 1, who had the longest history and the most profound clinical deficit, and who also had right hemisphere hypometabolism. The major brunt of the deficit was in the anterior portion of the left temporal lobe in all but 1 case, the patient with poor speech output who had a more severe left posterior frontal deficit. These findings suggest that in progressive aphasia due to focal cortical atrophy there is heterogeneity in the clinical presentation and anatomical site of the deficit, with possible implications for the underlying aetiology.\r"

During attacks coordination of movements and balance are disturbed; often a postural tremor of the head and the hands and fine twitching in some of the facial and hand muscles are present. The attacks usually last a few minutes and may occur several times per day. They first appear in childhood and tend to abate after early adulthood. The attacks are frequently precipitated by kinesigenic stimuli similar to those in paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Their occurrence can be reduced or prevented by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Between attacks a slight postural tremor and ataxia was found in a few of the elderly affected members. Fine rippling myokymia was obvious in a few and could be detected on close inspection in about half of the adults. Electromyography (EMG) showed myokymic discharges in all affected members. The characteristics and reactivity of this myokymic activity suggest multiple impulse generation in the peripheral nerves.\r"

In comparison with other types of brain damage which disrupt cognitive development, frontal damage acquired early in life appears to provide the neurological substrate for a special type of learning disability in the realms of insight, foresight, social judgement, empathy, and complex reasoning.\r"

Cranial CT was normal but MRI showed multiple bilateral lesions in the deep white matter. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies by single photon emission computerized tomography, however, showed an initial frontotemporal focus of hypoperfusion that progressively extended to include most of the ipsilateral hemisphere and the contralateral frontal lobe. This suggests that CBF imaging may yet be the most sensitive technique in revealing subclinical injury in the degenerative brain diseases of focal onset.\r"

  ".W": "In 23 patients with moderate to severe Huntington's disease (HD) and 21 normal volunteers, the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption (rCMRGlc) was measured in the cerebellum, thalamus, striatum, and cortex using positron emission tomography and the 18F-deoxyglucose method. In contrast to previous reports, rCMRGlc was reduced not only in the striatum, but also in the cerebral cortex of patients with HD as compared with normal subjects. No significant difference between HD patients and normal subjects was found for thalamic and cerebellar rCMRGlc. To investigate the relationship between the clinical status and rCMRGlc, correlation coefficients for the clinical data were calculated for absolute values of rCMRGlc and for cerebellar ratios (CR) of rCMRGlc. The duration of chorea correlated significantly only with the absolute values of frontoparietal and temporo-occipital rCMRGlc and with the CRs of most cortical regions evaluated. The severity of chorea correlated significantly only with lentiform nucleus rCMRGlc. The severity of dementia correlated significantly only with the frontoparietal and temporo-occipital rCMRGlc, the CRs of most cortical regions, and the CR for the caudate nucleus. The degree of disability correlated significantly with the CRs of all regions evaluated except the occipital and the superior frontal cortex. It appears from this study that there is a reduction not only for the striatum but also for cortical rCMRGlc in patients with manifest HD, and that the cortical reduction of rCMRGlc contributes to the severity of clinical symptoms in these patients. This challenges the concept that dementia in HD is of purely subcortical origin.\r"

Rotational testing was used to investigate the horizontal semicircular canal-ocular reflex, canal-otolith interaction, and the dynamic otolith-ocular reflex. Results indicated abnormal gain and phase of the horizontal semicircular canal-ocular reflex during sinusoidal rotation and a variable rate of decay of postrotatory responses. Each patient had abnormal canal-otolith interaction. An enlarged modulation component of the dynamic otolith-ocular response was observed in each patient. This study supports the idea that PAN is caused by an instability in the velocity storage element, a hypothetical neural circuit that perseverates the eye movement response to both vestibular and optokinetic stimulation. Further, we postulate that PAN may be caused by lesions of the cerebellar uvula and nodulus or their connections with the brainstem vestibular nuclei.\r"

The optic nerve fibre projection and vascular architecture of the caecocentral region of the retina is described. These anatomical features are discussed in relation to a number of possible anatomical explanations for the fact that a caecocentral scotoma is the characteristic field defect found in toxic amblyopia. We have been unable to identify a distinct anatomical feature which might explain this vulnerability but suggest that the problem has not as yet been clearly addressed by anatomists.\r"

In the testing posture (seated), patients with cerebral upper motoneuron lesions showed no selective loss of power in flexors or extensors on the contralateral side. Gravitational torques were included in the measurements. However, proximal muscles (acting at hip and knee) were significantly less severely affected than more distal muscles (acting at ankle and hallux). At any particular joint, physiological flexors and extensors were affected equally in both the hemiparetic and paraparetic subjects. As in the upper limb (Colebatch and Gandevia, 1989), the strength of muscles on the clinically unaffected side was reduced compared with control subjects, although no muscle groups were especially affected.\r"

This supports the view that a defect in the blood-brain barrier, and therefore inflammation, is an early and possibly crucial event in the pathogenesis of the new lesion in MS. These cases showed a marked discrepancy between MRI abnormality and symptoms. The mechanisms contributing to this disparity are discussed, and it is concluded that far from being surprising it is to be expected.\r"

Moderate intensity suprathreshold INMS, delivered in cutaneous fascicles, induced nonpainful sensations projecting to stereotyped and coherent areas of skin, the fascicular projected fields (FPFs). Fascicular receptive fields (FRFs) were mapped during microneurographic recording by determining the area of skin which, when activated by light tactile stimuli, elicited afferent neural discharges recorded intraneurally. It was found that at a given electrode position in a skin nerve fascicle, moderate intensity INMS induced nonpainful sensations projecting to a cutaneous field (FPF) that coincides with the FRF, while high intensity INMS induced painful sensations projecting within the cutaneous field of nonpainful sensations. Pain induced by INMS in muscle nerve fascicles was projected to the muscles innervated by that fascicle and, in most instances, to areas beyond the muscular receptive field. The study demonstrates that individual ulnar nerve fascicles, at wrist levels, subserve well-defined cutaneous territories in the hand, and that the area of skin covered by the sum of all ulnar fascicular receptive or projected fields matches the maximal possible cutaneous distribution of the ulnar nerve. Insights of practical relevance regarding clinical expression of fascicular nerve injuries are also brought up by this study.\r"

Five representative cases who showed a selective loss of the positive potential from the frontal area are reported. In each case, the parietal N20 potential was relatively well preserved, and the midposition between the frontal and central areas (FC area) showed a negative potential following P14. The peak of this negative potential was synchronous with that of the parietal N20 potential. This negativity on the FC area is considered to be a volume conducted potential from the parietal N20 to the prerolandic frontal area. Such an anterior volume conduction of the parietal N20 would not be explained by the concept of a tangentially oriented dipole generated in the posterior bank of the central sulcus. Instead, for the generator of the parietal N20 potential, a radically oriented dipole generated mainly in the parietal area is postulated.\r"

This includes a rare variant with X-linked dominant inheritance. We have traced this disorder through 6 generations of a large Canadian kindred; neurological and electrophysiological examinations were performed in 57 family members and nerve biopsies were studied in 2 affected males, early and late in the disease; 42/83 family members were affected. No male-to-male transmission was encountered in 19 sons of affected fathers, whereas all their daughters expressed the disease. Linkage was shown to the DNA loci DXYS1 Z max = 2.87 at theta max = 0.06 and to PGK1 Z max = 1.51 at theta max = 0 (Beckett et al., 1986). The typical clinical features are onset in early childhood, pes cavus, atrophy and weakness of peroneal muscles and intrinsic hand muscles, and sensory abnormalities. Males were severely affected, whereas females had mild or subclinical disease. Electrophysiological observations indicated a substantial loss of distal motor and sensory nerve fibres. Evoked compound muscle action potentials in extensor digitorum brevis were absent or severely reduced in 42% of cases and the peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity was mildly reduced to a mean 36.5 +/- 7.4 m.s-1. Sural sensory nerve action potentials were absent or severely reduced in 75% of those affected. Nerve biopsies showed loss of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibres, regenerative sprouting and secondary demyelination. The findings indicate that this distinct variant of HMSN is the result of primary axonal degeneration.\r"

Twelve patients (6 subjects with right parietal lesions and 6 subjects without neurological deficits) participated in the experiment. The results of Experiment 1 showed that in patients with right parietal lesions the speed and accuracy of response to horizontally aligned stimuli increased gradually from right to left, whereas the control group showed only the effect due to the different retinal eccentricities of the 3 stimuli, that is, responses to central stimuli were faster and more accurate than responses to left and right stimuli. The results of Experiment 2 showed that both the neurological and control groups were faster to respond to central than to left and right stimuli, and that the neurological group was faster to respond to right than left stimuli, whereas no difference in RTs between two visual fields was obtained in the control group. Furthermore, when the patients had to respond to 3 spatial locations aligned horizontally (Experiment 1), the speed and accuracy of response to the right stimulus were the same as when they had to focus attention on it (Experiment 2). These results showed that the focus of attention in patients with visual extinction is on the rightmost stimulus and that the increased attention to the right is accompanied by a decreased attention to the left.\r"

Tungsten microelectrodes were inserted percutaneously into motor fascicles of the ulnar nerve of 5 subjects, which was then blocked distally with local anaesthetic. In 4 subjects unitary action potentials were recorded from 16 motor axons, which were identified with respect to their target muscles. In the complete absence of muscle afferent feedback, subjects could voluntarily recruit motoneurons, grade their discharge and sustain a constant level of activity. Significant facilitation of motor efforts was provided by cutaneous feedback from the digits via the median nerve. During attempted maximal voluntary efforts the mean discharge frequencies of single motor axons were significantly lower than those of normally-innervated motor units. This finding suggests that peripheral afferents have a net facilitatory influence on motoneurons. However, during prolonged (20-30 s) maximal voluntary efforts the deafferented motoneurons did not display the progressive decline in discharge frequency shown by normally-innervated motor units during contractile fatigue, a finding consistent with two possible explanations: disfacilitation or reflex inhibition of the motoneuron pool by peripheral afferents. The results also indicate that the otherwise intact nervous system can perform some simple motor tasks with no proprioceptive input other than knowledge of the motor commands. Other factors may contribute to the poor motor performance reported for patients with severe sensory deficits.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the relation between use of oral contraceptives and the incidence of breast cancer, the authors reviewed the epidemiologic literature and used quantitative methods to summarize the data. Study results for any use of oral contraceptives were pooled using a model that accounted for both interstudy and intrastudy variability. The authors also explored interstudy variability and modeled a duration-effect relation between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer. Case-control and follow-up studies were considered separately. Overall, the authors observed no increase in the risk of breast cancer for women who had ever used oral contraceptives, even after a long duration of use. These results were consistent across study design. However, data combined from case-control studies revealed a statistically significant positive trend (P = 0.001) in the risk of premenopausal breast cancer for women exposed to oral contraceptives for longer duration. This risk was predominant among women who used oral contraceptives for at least 4 years before their first term pregnancy (relative risk = 1.72; 95% confidence interval = 1.36 to 2.19). Additional study is required to determine whether this finding in a subgroup of exposed women is confirmed and whether the risk remains increased with advancing age.\r"

  ".W": "The predictive value of estrogen receptor (ER) concentrations was evaluated in a group of 113 postmenopausal patients with estrogen-receptor-positive (ER greater than 7 fmol/mg protein) advanced breast cancer. In 103 patients, tumors were also sampled for progesterone receptor (PgR) determination. All patients were treated with toremifene, a novel antiestrogen, 60 mg daily. The median ER in 51 responders was 78 fmol/mg protein, and in 62 nonresponders, 51 fmol/mg protein; the median PgR levels were 40 and 37 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The response rate in patients with ER less than 50 fmol/mg protein was 38%, and 51% in the group with ER greater than 50 fmol/mg protein (not significant [NS]). The response rate in patients with PgR less than 10 fmol/mg protein was 42%, and in patients with greater than 10 fmol/mg protein, 44%. The duration of response in patients with ER greater than 50 fmol/mg protein was significantly longer than with lower ER levels (P = 0.002). PgR was not associated with the duration of response. In Cox's multiple regression analysis, ER was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.005) for response duration. Thus, the ER concentration of tumor tissue predicts the duration of response but not the response rate to toremifene in patients with advanced breast cancer. The PgR status does not predict the response rate or the duration of response.\r"

This regimen was used in a preoperative fashion for four cycles in patients considered surgically resectable and with curative intent for six cycles in the remainder of patients. The clinical response rate for the entire group was 84% and the overall local control rate was 74%. The median survival was 13 months with a median follow-up for live patients of 19 months. The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 30% and 23%, respectively. Histologic complete response was 39% and appeared to predict for survival. The 3-year actuarial survival and disease-free survival rates for 23 resected patients were 69% and 45%, respectively, with the complete histologic responders having a disease-free survival of 78%. The pattern of first recurrence did not appear to differ by histology or presence of lymph nodes in this subset of patients. The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates for inoperable patients receiving six cycles of treatment were 18% and 23%, respectively. The local control was 67% with the majority of these patients having Stage IIIB disease. The Mountain International staging system appeared to predict for operability, local recurrence, and survival. This concomitant treatment regimen is feasible, with the major toxicities being leukopenia, nausea, and vomiting.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, multicenter clinical trial was conducted in Western Norway to study the effectiveness of preoperative radiation therapy in operable rectal cancer, given at a dosage of 3150 cGy in 18 fractions, 2 to 3 weeks before radical surgery. Three hundred nine patients were entered into the trial between May 1976 and December 1985. After radiation no tumor was seen in 4.5% of the patients. There was no increased morbidity or mortality at surgery. The 5-year survival for evaluable patients was 57.5% in the control group and 56.7% in the radiotherapy group. For patients operated on for cure the 5-year survival was 60.9% and 64.2% in the control group and radiotherapy group, respectively. Radiation significantly delayed both local and distant recurrences in patients in the radiation group who had curative resection from 13.3 months in controls to 27.1 months. The local recurrence rate in the corresponding groups was 21.1% and 13.7%, respectively. We conclude that higher preoperative radiation doses should be used in new trials as a higher dosage may transform the observed positive effects into a survival benefit.\r"

They evaluated the relative ability of CT and LAG to detect disease in the abdomen. Two regions of the abdomen were designated, the upper and the lower, to further examine the capabilities of CT and LAG in the lower abdomen and CT in the upper abdomen. A LAG was more sensitive (P less than 0.05) than CT in detecting positive lower abdominal nodes. In the upper abdomen, CT scan had low sensitivity for detecting positive nodes, liver, or spleen. This study suggests that LAG of the lower abdomen provided more information than CT, and therefore should not be abandoned as a valid method for detecting nodal disease.\r"

Forty female Wistar rats received a 2250-cGy dose of irradiation to the distal 2 cm of the colon. Twenty received piroxicam 8.0 mg/kg orally 30 minutes before exposure and 24 hours after exposure; 20 rats served as irradiated controls. All animals were evaluated by colonoscopy 1 and 3 weeks postexposure and every third week until death or killing at 1 year. At killing, colons were removed for light microscopic examination. One year postirradiation results showed no differences in mortality, vascular changes, acute inflammation, colitis cystica profunda, or rectal stricture between the control and piroxicam-treated groups. However, at 1 year postirradiation the control group demonstrated neoplasia in 15 of 19 animals compared with eight of 20 animals in the piroxicam-treated group. The first endoscopic appearance of colonic neoplasm occurred at 15 weeks postirradiation in one control irradiated rat whereas the first evidence of endoscopic neoplasm in the piroxicam-treated group did not occur until 36 weeks postirradiation. Histologic examination documented a tendency toward a greater presence of adenocarcinomas in the control group compared with the piroxicam-treated group. The authors conclude that piroxicam treatment significantly decreased the incidence of colonic neoplasia in general as well as delayed the endoscopic appearance of colonic neoplasia in rats after pelvic irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "A diffuse sclerosing variant is not very rare among papillary carcinomas of the thyroid when the patients are female and younger than 30 years of age. The variant is characterized by diffuse involvement of one or both thyroid lobes, with dense sclerosis, patchy lymphocytic infiltration, and abundant psammoma bodies. Controversy still exists concerning its prognosis. We reviewed our experience with 14 patients treated between 1958 and 1988. All patients were young females, their age being from 10 to 28 years with a mean of 19.6. Hashimoto's thyroiditis had been suspected in nine patients before they came to our clinic. Nowadays the diagnosis of this cancer is possible when we have this entity in mind and detect abundant psammoma bodies either by ultrasonography or by soft-tissue roentgenography of the neck. Total thyroidectomy with modified neck dissection was carried out in eight patients, subtotal thyroidectomy with neck dissection in five, and lobectomy with neck dissection in one. All of them are alive and well without distant metastasis at a mean follow-up of 16 years. Because most of the patients with this variant of papillary carcinoma are young women and the prognosis is favorable, a complete resection without causing later recurrence, but also cosmetic and complication-free surgery, should be considered.\r"

  ".U": "91059304\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of internal mammary chain treatment on each type of malignant death-related event was analyzed in 1195 patients with operable breast cancer and histologically involved axillary lymph nodes. A group of 135 patients who had no internal mammary chain treatment was compared with a control group of 1060 patients who were treated by surgery and/or postoperative radiation therapy. In a multivariate analysis taking into account age, clinical size of the tumor, histoprognostic grading, and the number of positive axillary lymph nodes, quantitative interaction tests were used to determine whether the effects of internal mammary chain treatment on each type of malignant event were significantly different for patients with a lateral tumor compared with those with a medial tumor. The authors found that the effects of this treatment on the risks of distant metastases and of secondary breast cancer were not the same for the patients with a medial tumor as for those with a lateral tumor. For the untreated patients with a medial tumor, the risks of distant metastases and second breast cancer were, respectively, 1.6 (P = 0.02) and 2.9 (P = 0.02), compared with the treated patients. Conversely, for women with lateral tumor, no difference between the two treatment groups was observed. Thus, internal mammary chain treatment may improve long-term survival rate in patients with a medial tumor and positive axillary lymph nodes essentially by decreasing the risk of development of distant metastases (mainly brain, distant lymph nodes, multiple simultaneous metastases) and/or a secondary breast cancer.\r"

Twenty-three patients in the former group had no lymph node involvement, whereas 24 patients (35.3%) of the latter group had lymph node metastases. The 5-year survival rate after surgery for patients with SEC limited to the mucosa was 83.5%, which was significantly better than that for carcinoma invading the submucosa (54.9%). No recurrent disease occurred in patients with lesions limited to the mucosa. In conclusion, an esophagectomy with wide lymphadenectomy is necessary to provide a better prognosis for SEC invading the submucosa, whereas a less extensive treatment may be considered for SEC limited to the mucosa.\r"

Of these 568, 195 (34.3%) required no blood transfusion and 373 (65.7%) required transfusions within the perioperative period. Univariate analysis indicated that the survival time of the transfusion recipients was significantly less than that of the patients who had no transfusions (P less than 0.01). In subgroups of the authors' patients stratified to adjust for stage of disease, there was, however, no significant difference between the survival rates. Subsequently, multivariate analysis, using the Cox regression analysis, which adjusted for sex, age, and other covariates, indicated that perioperative blood transfusion was not a useful factor for predicting survival time. Multivariate analysis suggested that tumor size (P less than 0.01), degree of invasion into the gastric wall (P less than 0.01) and status of lymph node metastasis (P less than 0.01) were the most important covariates after curative gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. The authors' findings revealed the lack of any relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and survival time of patients who underwent curative resection for advanced gastric cancer.\r"

Nineteen patients had positive nodes. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting nodal metastases by TRUS were 63% and 85%. The positive and negative predictive values were 86% and 61%, respectively. TRUS was slightly superior to digital rectal examination in staging patients because of its superior ability to detect adenopathy. Adjacent organ involvement was correctly evaluated in five of six patients; peritumoral fibrosis was misinterpreted as tumor extension into uterus and ovary in one woman. Tumor shrinkage in all patients undergoing radiation therapy was identified, but fibrosis and edema made staging by TRUS unreliable in those patients.\r"

  ".W": "MaxEPA (MA), a fish oil high in omega-3 fatty acids, was combined with various levels of corn oil (CO), rich in omega-6 fatty acids, and fed to female CF1 mice. The three fish oil blends with CO and the two CO levels of the diets studied were as follows: 16.0% CO + 4.4% MA (Diet 1); 10.2% CO + 10.2% MA (Diet 2); 4.4% CO + 16.0% MA (Diet 3); 20.4% CO (Diet 4); and 4.4% CO (Diet 5). The diets were provided 2 weeks before weekly subcutaneous injection of saline or azoxymethanol (AOM). Studies of epithelial cell proliferation and the incidence of focal areas of dysplasia (FAD) involved six weekly AOM injections. One week after the last AOM injection and 1 hour before killing, mice were injected with tritiated thymidine (3HTdR). No differences in any proliferative parameters were found among the five groups of saline-treated mice. Among the AOM-treated animals, those fed Diet 3 showed significantly fewer cells per crypt and significantly fewer labeled cells/gland than CO Diets 4 and 5. Additionally, the distribution of S-phase cells in crypts of AOM-treated mice fed Diet 3 most closely resembled that of the saline controls. The greatest alteration in the distribution of proliferative cells was observed in the high-CO diet (Diet 4) and the lowest MA level (Diet 1). Mice fed Diets 2 and 3 had significantly fewer FAD/500 microns of distal colonic serial sections than those fed the high CO diet (Diet 4). Mice involved in chronic tumor incidence studies received only three weekly injections of the same dose of AOM. Regardless of diet, approximately 88% of all tumors arose in the distal colon. A significantly larger tumor-bearing population was observed in both the high-CO Diet 4 and the lowest MaxEPA (MA) diet (Diet 1) compared with the incidence in MA Diets 2 and 3 and the low-CO Diet 5. A diet with a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids of approximately 1.0 apparently prevented the development of an adenoma-type proliferative pattern thereby reducing FAD numbers and subsequent tumor incidence.\r"

This study examines the role of the chemoattractant, immunomodulator, and permeability-promoting agent leukotriene (LT) B4 in this setting. Sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulae were given IL-2, 10(5) U/kg as an IV bolus (n = 6). Within 2 hours this led to a significant increase in LTB4 levels in both plasma and lung lymph. The mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) rose while the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was unchanged. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) fell. Lung lymph flow (QL) was tripled (P less than 0.05) at 3 hours, coinciding with an increase in the lymph/plasma (L/P) protein ratio (P less than 0.05) resulting in an increase in the lymph protein clearance (P less than 0.05), data documenting increased microvascular permeability to protein. Mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (P less than 0.05) occurred. Body temperature rose and shaking chills were common. Pretreatment with the lipoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine (DEC; n = 6) reduced baseline plasma LTB4 levels and prevented the IL-2-induced increases in LTB4 in plasma and lung lymph (P less than 0.05). In contrast to IL-2 treatment alone, DEC blunted the increase in MPAP and prevented the rises in QL (P less than 0.05), L/P protein ratio (P less than 0.05), and lymph protein clearance (P less than 0.05). DEC also prevented the IL-2-induced leukopenia, the fall in platelet count, and the rise in body temperature (P less than 0.05, respectively). Infusion of IL-2 excipient control (n = 5) did not affect plasma or lymph LTB4 levels but there were mild increases in MPAP (P less than 0.05). The QL also rose but this occurred while the L/P protein ratio fell (P less than 0.05). Body temperature rose moderately. The PaO2, leukocyte, and platelet counts were unaffected. These data indicate that IL-2 administration leads to pulmonary dysfunction manifest by pulmonary hypertension and increased vascular permeability, events associated with LTB4 synthesis and prevented by DEC. Leukotriene B4 appears therefore to mediate the IL-2-induced lung injury.\r"

Clinical follow-up (2 to 17 years; mean, 8 years) was obtained for all patients. Half of the tumors had a normal DNA histogram and half exhibited an abnormal DNA profile consistent with DNA aneuploidy. Six of the seven patients with aneuploid tumors are alive and disease free (2 to 5 years postresection), and one is alive with metastatic disease. Of the seven patients with tumors showing normal DNA profiles, five are alive and disease free, one is dead of disease, and one is alive with metastatic disease. These data suggest that DNA ploidy analysis is unlikely to provide useful prognostic information for patients with insulinomas.\r"

In this study, 60 patients who received BMTs were evaluated for at least 30 days post-transplant for ulcerative mucositis and the presence of culturable HSV. Fifty-nine patients received prophylactic acyclovir. Forty-six patients developed ulcerative lesions and 45 of these were culture negative for HSV. Neither the source of transplant (autologous versus allogenic) nor the HSV antibody status of the patient affected the frequency of mucositis. The conditioning regimen appeared to be the most significant factor contributing to the severity of ulcerative mucositis. While the majority of ulcers occurred on movable nonkeratinized mucosa in BMT recipients, the usual sites of reactivation of intraoral HSV are nonmovable, keratinized mucosa. We conclude that HSV is probably not a major etiologic agent of mucositis in BMT recipients and that acyclovir is an effective agent in preventing HSV reactivation.\r"

  ".U": "91059316\r", 
  ".W": "An important disease entity distinct from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in Japan is adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which usually shows the same phenotype as CTCL, i.e., a helper/inducer T-cell phenotype (CD4+CD8-), and usually involves the skin. Clinically, both CTCL and ATL are heterogeneous in nature. In this study, we demonstrated differences between CTCL and ATL in terms of clinical and immunopathologic cell surface features. In patients with ATL, the predominant clinical findings were peripheral lymph node involvement, skin lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, leukemic manifestations, and an aggressive course. In patients with CTCL, by contrast, only skin lesions predominated at the onset of the disease and a relatively good prognosis was demonstrated. Phenotypic heterogeneity of ATL in the skin, i.e., CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8-, and CD4-CD8+, was demonstrated. Expression of Leu8, CD7 (Leu9), and CD45RA (2H4) was high in both the skin-infiltrating ATL cells and peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells compared with that in the skin-infiltrating CTCL cells. Expression of CD25 (IL-2R), CD71 (OKT9), HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ was higher in the skin-infiltrating ATL cells than in CTCL cells. Expression of CD29 (4B4) was high, and that of CD45RA (2H4) was low in both the skin-infiltrating ATL and CTCL cells compared with the peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells. Expression of CD45RO (UCHL-1) was not significantly high in the skin-infiltrating CTCL cells compared with that in ATL cells. The most significant phenotypic difference between ATL cells and CTCL cells was the expression of Leu8 (lymph node homing receptor), CD7 and CD25 antigens on the cell surface, and the main phenotypic difference between skin-infiltrating ATL and CTCL cells and peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells was the expression of CD29 and CD45RA. These findings confirm that the difference in antigen expression on the cell surface might reflect the clinical features of ATL and CTCL, and suggest that the predominant phenotype of peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells is that of naive, relatively immature or activated T-cells, and that CTCL cells are previously activated (memory) T-cells. In other words, CTCL cells do not share the same origin as ATL cells. These observations support the concept that ATL is a disease distinct from CTCL.\r"

This group of patients were followed for a minimum of 41 months (median, 48 months). Fifteen patients died within the follow-up period. von Willebrand factor levels were significantly higher in these 15 than the 13 survivors. Extreme elevation of ristocetin cofactor (greater than 300 U/dl) was seen in six of the 15 patients who died and in none of the survivors. Plasma vWF is elevated in head and neck cancer and the level measured at the time of diagnosis may have prognostic and potentially therapeutic implications.\r"

There were significant correlations between the presence of P24 and estrogen receptor, between histologic grade and P24 expression, and between estrogen and progesterone receptors. Of the tumor factors investigated only P24 protein was, however, of prognostic significance. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a significantly higher rate of response to treatment as well as more prolonged duration of response and duration of survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease. None of the other variables investigated were significantly predictive of outcome. P24 protein may be a useful predictor of prognosis in metastatic breast cancer.\r"

In the young group HCC showed (1) a high incidence of positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (young 71.4% versus old 20.1%); (2) relatively well-preserved hepatocellular function (indocyanine green test; young 10.7 +/- 8.8% versus old 20.6 +/- 10.8%); (3) low incidence of histologically verified concomitant cirrhosis (young 52.4% versus old 78.4%); and (4) a more advanced stage of the disease in TNM classification (Stage III; young 52.4% versus old 18.1%). With respect to survival rates achieved by surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, hepatitis B virus may relate to the occurrence of HCC in the young patients. Despite the advanced stage in the young group, survival rate after surgery was comparable with that achieved in the old group. These observations mean that a close periodic surveillance of young adults with a positive HBsAg is required to detect HCC at an early stage. Treatment of patients with HBsAg using interferon or vidarabine and hepatitis B vaccine should be made to convert HBsAg to negative in these individuals.\r"

An initial serum concentration of CA 125 was pathologic in 17% of the patients, the frequency of abnormal values being higher (P = 0.0001) in advanced (63%) than in early disease (10%). The serum PIIINP concentration was increased in 35% of the patients and more often (P less than 0.05) so in advanced (63%) than in early disease (31%). Among all the patients, at least one of the tumor markers was increased in 43% of the cases. In early disease 12 of 108 patients contracted recurrent cancer. The accuracy of the pathologic CA 125 (9%) and PIIINP (18%) concentrations in their prediction was poor. In the total material, pathologic CA 125 and PIIINP concentrations appeared simultaneously in 11 patients, of whom eight had poor prognoses. In monitoring of treatment response of 24 patients, regression was accompanied by normal or decreasing CA 125 and PIIINP values. The persistence of pathologic CA 125 and/or PIIINP concentration predicted relapse of the malignancy. In progressive disease, CA 125 and PIIINP concentrations together or separately remained at a pathologic level or increased continuously. In clinically stable endometrial carcinoma, CA 125 gave false-negative results in 71% of the determinations and PIIINP only in 12%. The current results suggest the use of CA 125 and PIIINP, simultaneously, in monitoring the clinical course of advanced endometrial carcinoma.\r"

Because of recent reports demonstrating clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor in these lesions, the AIL are now thought to represent a continuous spectrum of post-thymic T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) represents intermediate or high-grade B-cell malignancies in HIV-infected patients that may be etiologically related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). There have been reports of EBV-associated T-cell NHL, AIL, and large granular lymphocyte (LGL) proliferations, as well as HIV-associated T-cell neoplasia, LGL/T-cell proliferations, and AIL. We describe a case of polymorphic reticulosis (lethal midline granuloma) arising in an HIV-infected individual, who later progressed to AIDS, and review the literature on HIV-associated and EBV-associated T-cell neoplasia, LGL/T-cell proliferations, and AIL. The etiology of this AIL/T-cell NHL, especially in relation to EBV and HIV, is discussed.\r"

Using a radioenzymatic assay, the authors measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of B6, in 11 newly diagnosed untreated children with leukemia and 11 age-matched controls. The children with leukemia had significantly lower PLP levels than the controls. In 26 additional leukemia patients and 26 additional controls, a high-performance liquid chromatography assay also demonstrated lower plasma PLP levels in childhood leukemia compared with controls. These differences were significant for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The PLP values did not correlate with indices of leukemia cell burden, but did correlate with reported B6 intake, suggesting that illness-related diet changes are at least partially responsible for the low PLP levels. Before any chemotherapy, overall nutritional status was suboptimal in 53% of ALL cases and 57% of ANLL cases. Newly diagnosed children with leukemia have suboptimal overall nutrition as well as suboptimal vitamin B6 status.\r"

During the time period 1973 to 1985, left-sided colon cancers accounted for 63% of the cancers, right-sided cancers 33%, and cancers with unspecified sites 4%. Indeed, this pattern of distribution has remained constant for 25 years. For the period 1935 to 1985, we calculated the sex-specific, age-adjusted (normalized to the 1970 U.S. Census) incidence. Age-adjusted incidence of rectal cancer has remained stable for 50 years: for men, 22.8 cases/100,000/year, and for women, 13.9 cases/100,000/year. During these 50 years, the age-adjusted incidence of cecal carcinoma for men has increased from 3.6 to 16.7 cases/100,000/year, while for women, it has increased from 4.9 to 14.2 cases/100,000/year. Sigmoid carcinoma for men has increased from 8.8 to 18.7 cases/100,000/year, and for women, it has increased from 7.7 to 12.8 cases/100,000/year. The incidence of colon cancer at each site has been and continues to be increasing at a constant rate. Age-adjusted incidence for all colorectal cancers has increased from 35.2 to 70.2 cases/100,000/year for men and from 32.1 to 49.2 cases/100,000/year for women. Thus, distribution of colorectal cancers by site in Connecticut has remained stable for 25 years. More importantly, however, the age-adjusted incidence of colon cancer has continued to increase for 50 years, whereas that of rectal cancer has remained relatively stable.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence exists that an endothelium-derived relaxing factor is nitric oxide and that L-arginine is the precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide in vitro. Whether exogenous L-arginine contributes to the modulation of vascular smooth muscle tone in vivo is still controversial. In hypercholesterolemia, resistance vessels do not relax normally in response to pharmacological stimuli that release endothelium-derived relaxing factor; bioassay experiments have suggested that impaired synthesis or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor accounts, in part, for this blunted relaxation. We hypothesized that hypercholesterolemia reduces arginine metabolism and thereby impairs endothelium-derived relaxing factor synthesis. Accordingly, we designed a study to determine whether exogenous L-arginine could augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation of hind limb resistance vessels in anesthetized cholesterol-fed rabbits. Femoral blood flow was recorded with an electromagnetic flow probe in 16 cholesterol-fed and 12 control rabbits. The hind limb vasodilator responses to incremental intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine (0.3-9.0 micrograms/kg/min) and nitroprusside (0.3-9.0 micrograms/kg/min) were studied before and during intravenous administration of L-arginine (10 mg/kg/min), D-arginine (10 mg/kg/min), or saline. The vasodilator response to acetylcholine was impaired in cholesterol-fed rabbits as compared with control rabbits. L-Arginine augmented vasodilation to acetylcholine in cholesterol-fed but not in control rabbits. L-Arginine did not alter the effect of nitroprusside in either group. Neither saline nor D-arginine changed the response to either acetylcholine or nitroprusside. Our data demonstrate that exogenous L-arginine normalizes the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of hind limb resistance vessels in cholesterol-fed rabbits.\r"

The relations of the mean arterial pressure-RSNA and mean arterial pressure-heart rate were examined over a wide range of blood pressures produced by infusions of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin. The maximum slope obtained by logistic function analysis was considered to represent the baroreflex sensitivity. In the early hypertensive group (n = 8; mean arterial pressure +/- SEM, 88 +/- 2 mm Hg) on day 5 after renal clip application, the maximum slope of the mean arterial pressure-RSNA relation was -11.3 +/- 1.2, which was significantly greater than that of the sham normotensive group (-6.9 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.05). The maximum slope (-4.3 +/- 0.2) of the mean arterial pressure-RSNA relation in the late hypertensive group (n = 8; mean arterial pressure, 96 +/- 3 mm Hg) on day 21 after renal clipping was significantly smaller than that of another sham group (-7.2 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.05). In contrast to these changes in the baroreflex control of RSNA, the control of heart rate was attenuated according to the magnitude of mean arterial pressure. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potentiated baroreflex, the effects of endogenous neuropeptides were investigated. First, plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and arginine vasopressin that are known to affect the baroreflex were determined. Plasma concentrations of vasopressin (3.1 +/- 0.6 pg/ml) as well as of angiotensin II (34 +/- 7 pg/ml) were increased in the early hypertensive group, and the plasma vasopressin returned to a similar level to the sham group in the late hypertensive group (1.3 +/- 0.4 pg/ml). Second, to study endogenous effects of these neuropeptides on the baroreflex, the maximum slopes of the baroreflex curves during infusions of antagonists for the peptides were determined in the early hypertensive group. The maximum slope of mean arterial pressure-RSNA during intravertebral arterial [Sar1, Ala8]-angiotensin II (-16.4 +/- 1.5) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05), whereas the maximum slope during intravertebral arterial infusion of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin (-4.7 +/- 0.5) was significantly smaller (p less than 0.05) than that during vehicle infusion (-11.3 +/- 1.2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Dogs (n = 8) were chronically instrumented with arterial and venous catheters, cervical vagal cooling coils, and right atrial and right ventricular bipolar epicardial pacing and recording electrodes. After autonomic blockade (10 mg/kg i.v. hexamethonium, 0.11 mg/kg i.v. atropine, and vagal cold blockade), VIP (50 and 100 pmol/kg/min i.v.) or isoproterenol (ISO) (250 and 500 pmol/kg/min i.v.) increased heart rate (maximum increases: VIP, 81.1 +/- 4.2 beats/min; ISO, 61.3 +/- 8.5 beats/min), decreased the atrial-ventricular interval (during constant atrial pacing) (VIP, -41.9 +/- 6.3 msec; ISO, -34.6 +/- 7.4 msec), shortened the atrial effective refractory period (VIP, -24.4 +/- 2.1 msec; ISO, -30.6 +/- 4.4 msec) and ventricular effective refractory period (VIP, -4.2 +/- 0.7 msec; ISO, -10.0 +/- 2.4 msec), and decreased mean arterial pressure (VIP, -51.9 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; ISO, -26.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg). beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) eliminated the positive chronotropic and atrioventricular nodal dromotropic responses to bolus doses of ISO (30, 100, 300, and 1,000 pmol/kg i.v.) but did not affect the responses to VIP (10, 30, 100, and 300 pmol/kg i.v.). Comparable blood pressure decreases produced by sodium nitroprusside caused only minimal changes in heart rate, atrial-ventricular conduction times, and atrial and ventricular refractory periods. In three additional anesthetized dogs, after vagotomy and beta-adrenergic blockade (1 mg/kg i.v. propranolol), VIP (100 pmol/kg/min i.v.) shortened the atrial-His interval but did not alter intra-atrial, intraventricular, or His-Purkinje conduction. Our findings combined with the demonstration by others of VIP-immunoreactive nerves innervating canine sinus nodal cells, atrioventricular nodal cells, and atrial and ventricular myocardial cells suggest that endogenous VIP may directly alter the electrical properties of the heart.\r"

  ".W": "Several intracellular enzymes have been shown to have altered total activity or isoenzyme composition in cardiac hypertrophy. This study tests the hypothesis that the accumulation of the fetal-type (BB + MB) creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes in hypertrophied adult myocardium is related to an increase in blood pressure. Consideration was made for the location, size, and hemodynamic load of the myocytes. By using the two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) rat model of renal hypertension with and without hydralazine treatment, CK (total and isoenzyme), lactate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase activities and myocyte size were measured. An increased heart weight/body weight ratio occurred in both untreated 2K1C rats (4.15 +/- 0.09) and hydralazine-treated 2K1C rats (4.12 +/- 0.13) as compared with control rats (3.25 +/- 0.10). Blood pressure was high only in untreated 2K1C rats (196 +/- 9 mm Hg), as compared with hydralazine-treated 2K1C rats (142 +/- 6 mm Hg) and control rats (135 +/- 3 mm Hg). Myocytes were isolated from five ventricular regions: left ventricular epicardial and endocardial free wall, left and right halves of the interventricular septum, and right ventricular free wall. Regional differences in normal and hypertrophied myocardium were demonstrated for morphological and biochemical parameters, with the greatest changes occurring in left ventricular endocardium. The shift in CK isoenzyme expression toward accumulating more BB + MB was greater in \"hypertensive hypertrophy\" (untreated 2K1C rats) than in \"nonhypertensive hypertrophy\" (hydralazine-treated 2K1C rats). Calculations incorporating isolated myocyte volume showed that the cellular content of total CK remained the same during the hypertrophic process, accounting for a decrease in the tissue activity. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activities suggests that hypertrophied myocardium has relatively higher glycolytic capacity and that this effect is exacerbated in the presence of high blood pressure. We conclude that increased blood pressure is more closely linked to the fetal CK isoenzyme shift than is hypertrophy alone.\r"

We examined the possibility that a molecule related to porcine brain natriuretic peptide (pBNP), which acts at the same receptor sites as atrial natriuretic peptide, might provide an alternative source of natriuretic peptide to the cardiovascular system in the rat. An antiserum against pBNP demonstrated profuse immunoreactive innervation of the heart, cerebrovascular tree, and renal arteries. pBNP-like immunoreactive fibers ran in bundles along the surface of the heart, innervating the atria most heavily and penetrating the ventricular myocardium along the coronary arteries. There was greater density of innervation of the right side of the heart compared with the left, particularly in the ventricles, suggesting a parasympathetic origin. The entire cerebrovascular tree was innervated by immunoreactive pBNP fibers, with the densest concentration of immunoreactive fibers along the surface of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, posterior communicating, and anterior cerebral arteries. The proximal renal arteries were not innervated, but as they approached the kidney, they were invested by bundles of immunoreactive pBNP fibers. These axons followed the major branches of the renal artery into the kidney parenchyma, running along the surface of the arterioles up to their entrance into the renal glomeruli. No immunoreactive innervation of the aorta or proximal brachiocephalic, subclavian, or carotid arteries was seen. A substance related to pBNP may serve as a neuromodulator regulating cardiac output as well as blood flow in certain vascular beds.\r"

  ".W": "Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy in renovascular hypertension is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the extracellular space and around intramyocardial coronary arteries. Even though the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was previously found to attenuate this interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, the relative importance of arterial and ventricular systolic pressures versus circulating angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (AL) in promoting hypertrophy and collagen accumulation in renovascular hypertension is uncertain. By drawing on the in-parallel arrangement of the right and left ventricles, with respect to their coronary circulation, and the in-series mechanical alignment of the ventricles, with a pressure-overloaded left and a normotensive right ventricle, this study sought to address this uncertainty. Three models of experimental hypertension, each having a different circulating AII and AL profile, were examined and compared with their controls: renovascular hypertension, where both AII and AL are increased; infrarenal aorta banding, where AII and AL are normal; and a chronic infusion of AL, where AII is suppressed or normal and AL is increased. In renovascular hypertension, as well as with AL, we found a significant rise in the interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area of the pressure-overloaded, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. This remodeling was not seen in either ventricle with infrarenal aorta banding despite comparable systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, in experimental arterial hypertension in the rat, myocyte and nonmyocyte compartments of the myocardium are under separate controls: myocyte hypertrophy is most closely related to ventricular loading while circulating AII and AL, acting alone or in concert with other humoral factors, regulate the accumulation of collagen within the right and left ventricles.\r"

Cerebral blood flow was measured using 4-iodo[N-methyl-14C]antipyrine, and the total and perfused microvasculature was studied by injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran and alkaline phosphatase staining. To maintain constant PCO2, hypoxia was achieved in chemoreceptor-intact rats by the use of 4% CO2-8% O2-88% N2 and in chemodenervated rats by the administration of 8% O2-92% N2. Blood gas and hemodynamic parameters were similar in the two groups of rats. Chemodenervation had no significant effect on either resting blood flow or the perfused microvasculature during normoxia. A significant increase in cerebral blood flow (from 71 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g in control and from 91 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g in chemodenervated rats) and in the percent of cerebral arterioles and capillaries perfused occurred in both hypoxic control and chemodenervated rats. In chemoreceptor-intact rats, the greatest increase in blood flow and in perfused microvasculature occurred in caudal structures (medulla and pons) in comparison with rostral structures (cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus). In chemodenervated rats, a similar increase in blood flow and perfused microvasculature occurred in all brain regions, with no regional differences. Thus, chemodenervation did not affect the overall cerebral blood flow or the microvascular response to hypoxia; however, rostral-to-caudal regional differences in the hypoxic response were lost after chemodenervation.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effects of mono-L-arginine-containing compounds on pial arterioles of anesthetized piglets. A closed cranial window was implanted, and the diameter of one pial arteriole was determined by intravital microscopy. Diameter was determined during application of artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing no drugs and during application of 10(-5), 10(-4), 10(-3), and 10(-2) M L-arginine (ARG), L-arginine ethyl ester (AEE), N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine (NBA), N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ester ethyl (BAEE), and L-citrulline (CIT). Initial diameters were 100-200 microns. All of these compounds dilated arterioles, but the threshold concentration needed to elicit dilation varied: 10(-5) M for NBA (n = 5), 10(-3) M for AEE (n = 9) and BAEE (n = 6), and 10(-2) M for ARG (n = 6) and CIT (n = 4). Maximal responses were 15 +/- 8% for CIT, 17 +/- 4% for ARG, 19 +/- 8% for BAEE, 28 +/- 5% for NBA, and 27 +/- 6% for AEE. Indomethacin pretreatment (5 mg/kg i.v.) did not change arteriolar responses to AEE, NBA, and BAEE. However, coadministration of methylene blue (0.5 x 10(-4) M or 0.5 x 10(-3) M) abolished dilation to 10(-3) M AEE or BAEE and attenuated dilation to 10(-5) M NBA. In addition, coadministration of hemoglobin (0.4 x 10(-4) M) abolished dilation to AEE, BAEE, or NBA. Last, intravenous (5 mg/kg) and coadministration (10(-3) M) of NG-methyl-L-arginine blocked dilation to NBA or AEE.

To determine whether calcium channel blockade is effective in halting the progressive depression of myocardial contractile performance in this animal model of congestive heart failure, oral verapamil therapy was instituted at 50 days of age, and treatment continued for various durations until the time of study at either 150 or 250 days of age. Left ventricular papillary muscle isometric and isotonic performance, as well as transmembrane electrical characteristics, was depressed in diseased hamsters at 150 days of age and deteriorated further by 250 days of age. These changes were evidenced by prolongation of contraction duration, a marked depression in the load-velocity relation, and a significant prolongation in the repolarization phase of the transmembrane action potential. Myocardial functional and electrical alterations associated with the progression of life in myopathic hamsters were completely halted by verapamil therapy that was continuous from 50 days after birth until death by diastolic arrest, at 150 or 250 days of age. However, premature termination of verapamil treatment before death resulted in a progressive renewal of the functional and electrical alterations for the duration of drug termination. It is concluded that the pathological changes seen during the lifetime of the cardiomyopathic hamster can be prevented by continuous calcium channel blockade and that intermediate prevention can be attained by protracted verapamil therapy. Thus, chronic verapamil therapy may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of human congestive heart failure of similar etiology.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that prostaglandins released from vascular endothelial cells contribute to activation of baroreceptors during increases in arterial pressure. Baroreceptor activity was recorded from the vascularly isolated carotid sinus in rabbits anesthetized with chloralose. Baroreceptor activity was measured during ramp or step increases in nonpulsatile carotid sinus pressure over a range of 0-175 mm Hg. Exposure of the isolated carotid sinus to inhibitors of prostaglandin formation (indomethacin [n = 10] or aspirin [n = 6]) decreased baroreceptor activity significantly (p less than 0.05). The slope of the pressure-activity relation averaged 0.80 +/- 0.07 %/mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) during control measurements and 0.72 +/- 0.06 and 0.63 +/- 0.05 %/mm Hg during exposure to 10 and 20 microM indomethacin, respectively. Exposure of the carotid sinus to exogenous prostacyclin (PGI2 [n = 11]) increased baroreceptor activity significantly. The slope of the pressure-activity relation averaged 0.89 +/- 0.10, 1.09 +/- 0.09, and 1.26 +/- 0.16 %/mm Hg during control and during exposure to 10 and 20 microM PGI2, respectively. Activity returned to control after removal of PGI2 (0.89 +/- 0.12 %/mm Hg). Removal of endothelium with either a balloon catheter (n = 4) or a jet of a 95% O2-5% CO2 gas mixture (n = 6) decreased the slope of the pressure-activity relation from 0.92 +/- 0.09 to 0.56 +/- 0.08 %/mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Exposure of the denuded sinus to exogenous PGI2 (20 microM [n = 4]) restored activity (slope = 1.09 +/- 0.24 %/mm Hg). Neither indomethacin (n = 5) nor PGI2 (n = 5) nor denudation (n = 5) significantly altered the pressure-diameter relation of the carotid sinus (sonomicrometers), suggesting that the effects on baroreceptor discharge are not caused by altered stretch of the carotid sinus at a given pressure. The results suggest that prostaglandins (e.g., PGI2) released from endothelium contribute in a paracrine manner to activation of baroreceptors during increases in arterial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "To achieve transcardiac threshold current during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax to compensate for the shunting effect of the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the torso. This shunting effect is thus an important determinant of transthoracic defibrillation threshold and can be quantified by the transcardiac current fraction (FC, the ratio of transcardiac to transthoracic threshold currents). Previous estimates of FC have ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 45%. The purpose of of this study was to quantify both FC and the major intrathoracic current pathways. Transthoracic and intrathoracic voltages and currents were simultaneously measured during high-voltage transthoracic shocks in 20 dogs. With correction factors determined from another set of 12 dogs, these raw data were corrected to compensate for field distortion caused by the presence of the intrathoracic electrodes, and the adjusted data were fit to a resistive network model. The results showed that 82% of the transthoracic current was shunted by the thoracic cage, while 14% was shunted by the lungs. The remaining 4% (FC) is the portion that passed through the heart. There was good agreement between the two independent methods used to calculate FC. Analysis based on the model indicated that FC was 3.7%, whereas FC determined by direct measurement with calibrated electrodes was 4.2%. Therefore, the results of this study, in contrast to earlier estimates of FC, show that defibrillation in dogs is achieved by only 4% of the total transthoracic current.\r"

It is directly proportional to the transcardiac threshold current and inversely proportional to the transcardiac current fraction (FC) or the ratio of transcardiac and transthoracic current. Although experimental and theoretical estimates of FC have been as high as 45%, previous measurements in humans have not been made. This study was designed to quantify FC in humans. During intraoperative testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transthoracic rescue shocks of 200-400 J were delivered when the device failed to defibrillate. Simultaneous transthoracic voltage (VT) and transcardiac voltage (VC) between two implanted epicardial patch electrodes were measured. The ratio, VC/VT, was 0.04 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) in 10 patients. In 16 dogs, a comparison was made between direct measurement of FC and VC/VT. FC was determined with a specially designed electrode system, which was calibrated to account for field distortion introduced by the electrodes. There was no significant difference between FC and VC/VT, which were both approximately 0.05, suggesting that VC/VT was statistically equivalent to FC. The results of this study, therefore, indicate that during transthoracic defibrillation in humans, approximately 4% of transthoracic current traverses the heart. This relatively small percentage of current results from the existence of parallel pathways, such as the thoracic cage and lungs, which shunt current around the heart.\r"

In the three perfused hearts and in four of the excised hearts, right ventricular free wall regional segment lengths and segment area also were assessed. Biventricular volumes were measured directly with intracavitary balloons in all isolated hearts. When left ventricular balloon volume was held constant, relations between right ventricular free wall dimensions and right ventricular balloon volume were highly linear. With increments in left ventricular volume, however, these relations remained linear but shifted progressively upward, indicating an independent relation between right ventricular free wall dimensions and left ventricular cavitary volume. An ellipsoidal shell subtraction model (pi/6.abd minus right ventricular free wall volume) was developed to estimate right ventricular cavitary volume from cardiac dimensions. With this method, a highly linear relation was observed between calculated right ventricular volume and right ventricular balloon volume (mean r = 0.99 +/- 0.01). Moreover, this relation appeared to be independent of changes in left ventricular balloon volume. With the shell subtraction model, dynamic right ventricular volume was computed in nine conscious dogs, and in four, stroke volume derived from dimensions was compared with right ventricular stroke volume measured with ultrasonic flow probes. A highly linear relation was observed, suggesting the accuracy of the shell subtraction method in vivo. Right ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume and stroke work/end-diastolic volume relations then were evaluated, and both proved to be highly linear in the right ventricle (both mean r = 0.99 +/- 0.01). Thus, the shell subtraction model allows a simple estimate of dynamic right ventricular volume in the intact heart and facilitates assessment of right ventricular performance in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanical restitution of the left ventricle of closed-chest dogs was modeled as a monoexponential relation, using peak single-beat elastance as a measure of contractile strength. Data were obtained from nine dogs chronically instrumented with three sets of piezoelectric diameter gauges to assess ventricular volume and high-fidelity manometers to measure pressure. Mechanical restitution curves were obtained during both atrial and ventricular pacing in six dogs. The time constant of mechanical restitution was 64.3 +/- 11.4 msec for atrial and 122.2 +/- 26.3 msec for ventricular paced runs (p less than 0.01). These values are smaller than those previously reported from isolated hearts or isolated muscle segments. Although the time of onset of mechanical restitution was longer for atrial than for ventricular runs (255.1 +/- 14.3 versus 225.1 +/- 9.6 msec, p less than 0.05), the plateau to which mechanical function rose was not different. During ventricular pacing, fusion beats were noted in four dogs. The magnitude of the mechanical contribution of these fusion beats fell to a nadir at approximately 250 msec, suggesting that intracellular calcium available for crossbridge interaction is dropping during this time. In three additional dogs, the time constant of postextrasystolic restitution was found to vary depending on the preceding extrasystolic interval. Thus, mechanical restitution of the ventricle is a dynamic process that can be assessed using an elastance-based approach in the in situ heart.\r"

Pharmacological and biochemical evidence argue for and against the proposal that endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is identical with free NO. In an attempt to identify EDRF as free NO, a bioassay technique was combined with an NO trap (hemoglobin bound to agarose; Ag-Hb), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to detect the resultant nitrosylhemoglobin (NO-Hb). Canine femoral arteries with or without endothelium were perfused with physiological saline solution containing superoxide dismutase and ibuprofen and were stimulated with acetylcholine. The relaxing activity of the effluent was monitored in canine coronary artery rings without endothelium (bioassay tissue) half-maximally contracted with U46619. Acetylcholine stimulated the release of EDRF from intact femoral arteries (but not from segments without endothelium), which relaxed the bioassay tissue by 63 +/- 5%. NO (approximately 1 and approximately 10 nM) infused directly over the bioassay tissue produced 34 +/- 8% and 96 +/- 3% relaxation, respectively (ED50, approximately 2 nM). Effluents were collected under vacuum in the absence of oxygen through a column containing Ag-Hb, and the samples were assayed for NO-Hb by EPR. Samples containing NO produced the triplet EPR signal characteristic of NO-Hb, but the effluent containing EDRF did not. Infusion of NO through the donor tissue in the presence of acetylcholine gave an EPR signal similar to that observed when NO had no contact with the tissue. Nitrite anion (up to 2.7 x 10(-2) M) produced no detectable NO-Hb in analogous experiments. Thus, EDRF released from the native endothelium of canine femoral artery cannot be identified as free NO. The present findings support a concept that EDRF may be a labile precursor of NO.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that oxygen-derived free radicals may contribute to the myocardial injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion. As the presence of enhanced free radical generation is a prerequisite for such damage, several techniques have been used to provide evidence of increased oxygen free radical production during reperfusion; however, all such techniques have substantial limitations. In this study, we used enhanced chemiluminescence to evaluate oxygen free radical generation during ischemia and reperfusion in the isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart. The chemiluminescent technique, which has high sensitivity and can monitor radical generation continuously, avoids some of the limitations of earlier methods. Chemiluminescence (expressed as counts per second) decreased from 219 +/- 11 at baseline to 142 +/- 9 during ischemia and markedly increased to a peak of 476 +/- 36 during the first 3-5 minutes of reperfusion. This was followed by a slow decline over 11-16 minutes to a steady-state level of 253 +/- 14 (each sequential change in chemiluminescence was highly significant; p less than 0.001). Superoxide dismutase (2,000 units/min) significantly decreased peak reperfusion chemiluminescence to 316 +/- 17 (p less than 0.01). Hearts subjected to a second period of ischemia and reperfusion had a higher peak chemiluminescence (626 +/- 62), which also was significantly attenuated by 1,000 units/min superoxide dismutase (398 +/- 16; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced elevation of arterial pressure, there is an attenuation of the baroreflex control of heart rate (HR), but the site of this action of Ang II on the baroreflex is not known. To investigate the role of the area postrema, the effects of Ang II on arterial pressure and HR and on the baroreflex control of HR were compared in intact and area postrema-lesioned conscious rabbits. In intact rabbits, infusion of Ang II (2.5-100 ng/kg/min) produced dose-related increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP); the largest dose increased MAP by 32 +/- 3 mm Hg. HR decreased only at the highest dose of Ang II (21 +/- 6 beats/min). In lesioned rabbits, the increase in MAP was reduced (23 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) while the decrease in HR was enhanced (50 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.01). The pressor and HR responses to infusion of phenylephrine (PE) (2-20 micrograms/kg/min) were not different between the two groups. In intact rabbits, the slope of the relation between HR and MAP during Ang II infusion was less than that during PE infusion; in lesioned rabbits, the slopes were not significantly different. Responses to bolus injections of Ang II and PE in intact and lesioned rabbits were similar to those obtained in the infusion study. In another series of experiments, cardiac baroreflex responses with or without background infusion of Ang II were obtained by increasing blood pressure with graded infusions of PE (2-20 micrograms/kg/min). In intact rabbits, infusion of Ang II at 10 ng/kg/min shifted the baroreflex to a higher pressure level (resetting) without changing its slope (sensitivity). Background infusion of PE caused comparable increases in blood pressure, but the subsequent baroreflex response was identical to the response without background PE. In lesioned rabbits, background infusion of Ang II did not change the slope, nor did it reset the baroreflex. The effects of Ang II on baroreflex responses during nitroprusside infusions (2-20 micrograms/kg/min) in intact and lesioned rabbits were the same as those observed during the PE infusions. These findings indicate that the attenuation of the baroreflex control of HR by Ang II results from resetting of the cardiac baroreflex and suggest that this effect is mediated via the area postrema.\r"

Thirty anesthetized pigs were instrumented with left anterior descending arterial and venous catheters, crystals for instantaneous wall thickness, and a fluid-filled occluder. Measurement of myocardial blood flow was performed with microspheres, and a series of myocardial biopsies also was performed. In 10 pigs, overall coronary blood flow was lowered by 22%, with a fall in subendocardial-to-subepicardial flow ratio from 1.11 to 0.54 and in wall thickening from 33% to 15%. Subendocardial flow fell 48%. Coronary blood flow and thickening were constant during 1 hour of ischemia. Phosphocreatine (mumol/g wet wt) in the subendocardial third of the ischemic zone fell from 7.6 to 3.8 at 5 minutes of ischemia (p less than 0.005 versus control) and returned to normal (7.9) at 60 minutes (p = NS), despite ongoing ischemia. Subendocardial ATP (mumol/g wet wt) fell slowly from 4.3 and leveled off at 2.1 at 60 minutes of ischemia (p less than 0.001 versus control). Similar regeneration of phosphocreatine was found in seven additional pigs, with a 43% transmural reduction in coronary blood flow and a 66% reduction in subendocardial flow. No significant changes in ATP and phosphocreatine were noted in two different control groups (n = 13 pigs). The regeneration of phosphocreatine despite ongoing ischemia and low ATP levels was not related to changes in myocardial oxygen demand or consumption, or in regional function during the period of ischemia. This may reflect 1) a successful downregulation of the energy needs of the ischemic myocardium to maintain cell viability, or 2) a metabolic abnormality in the ability of the cells to produce ATP primarily or by use of phosphocreatine.\r"

In resting platelets, ouabain induces a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and a marked elevation of Ca2+ in the intracellular stores. The amount of Ca2+ mobilized from these stores upon stimulation with thrombin, as well as thrombin-induced secretion of platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine, was increased after preincubation with the glycoside (3 x 10(-6) M). These data show that ouabain induces an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, most likely mediated via Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange, and that this incremental amount of Ca2+ is accumulated in an intracellular store involved in stimulus-response coupling. This may explain the enhanced functional responses of platelets to agonists in the presence of ouabain and suggests a role for Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange in Ca2+ homeostasis of the human platelet.\r"

The volume conductor effects are treated by using an inhomogeneous, multicompartmental model of the thorax, based on \"tailored\" geometry derived from magnetic resonance imaging. The required activation function, specifying the timing of the ventricular depolarization process, was derived from an inverse procedure that uses as input data electric signals measured at the body surface. Next, the magnetic signals from the same subjects were measured. A close correspondence between computed and measured magnetic signals was observed (relative root mean square residual difference of 0.37). These results demonstrate that magnetocardiograms and electrocardiograms have a common basis and that it is unlikely that prominent sources exist that are electrically silent and yet active in the genesis of the magnetic fields associated with the depolarization process of the heart. Moreover, fresh support is implied for the usefulness of the classical uniform double layer as the electrical source model during ventricular depolarization. The contributions of the secondary sources have previously been found to be a major component of the electric signals; they are now also shown to be a major component of the magnetic signals.\r"

As a first approximation to providing an ionic basis to complex excitation patterns in cardiac cells, we have compared the predictions of the one-dimensional model with those of numerical simulations using a modified high-dimensional ionic model of the space-clamped myocyte. Stimulus-response ratios were recorded at various stimulus magnitudes, durations, and frequencies. Iteration of the difference equation model reproduced all important features of the ionic model results, including a wide spectrum of stimulus-response locking patterns, period doubling, and irregular (chaotic) dynamics. In addition, in the parameter plane, both models predict that the bifurcation structure of the cardiac cell must change as a function of stimulus duration, because stimulus duration modifies the type of supernormal excitability present at short diastolic interval. We conclude that, to a large extent, the bifurcation structure of the ionic model under repetitive stimulation can be understood by two functions: excitability and action potential duration. The characteristics of these functions depend on the stimulus duration.\r"

In contrast, most neonatal Purkinje fibers show an increase in automaticity in response to these concentrations of NE. We studied the modulation of NE effects, using the subtype selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists chloroethylclonidine (CEC) and WB 4101. CEC selectively antagonized the decrease in automatically such that, in both age groups, all Purkinje fibers showed NE-induced increases in automaticity. In Purkinje fibers from dogs treated with pertussis toxin, NE no longer induced a CEC-sensitive decrease in automaticity. In contrast, WB 4101 selectively antagonized the NE-induced increase in automaticity in both age groups. In the presence of WB 4101, NE decreased automaticity uniformly in adult Purkinje fibers and tended to induce no change in automaticity in neonatal Purkinje fibers. In the presence of prazosin (10(-6) M) or combined CEC (10(-7) M) and WB 4101 (10(-7) M), no alpha-agonist-induced increase or decrease in rate was observed. Pretreatment of membranes from newborn and adult dog and rat ventricles with CEC resulted in a selective and irreversible inactivation of 25% of specific binding sites labeled with [125I]IBE2254. In cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, exposure to CEC resulted in a 35% decrease in the density of specific binding sites labeled with [125I]IBE2254 but did not influence alpha-adrenergic stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation. In contrast, WB 4101 inactivated NE-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation. Our results suggest that 1) at least two distinct alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes are present in neonatal and adult cardiac tissue, 2) the CEC-sensitive subtype is linked to a decrease in automaticity via a pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate, 3) the WB 4101-sensitive subtype is linked to an increase in automaticity (possibly via a mechanism related to phosphoinositide breakdown), and 4) although CEC- and WB 4101-sensitive alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes are present in the neonate, only the WB 4101-sensitive subtype is expressed functionally to induce effects on ventricular automaticity.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we have shown that dexamethasone treatment of rabbits specifically reduces vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to agonists that interact with the vascular thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptor. One potential site at which dexamethasone can influence prostanoid-mediated vasoconstriction may be at the level of the vascular TXA2/PGH2 receptor. Therefore, we characterized the vascular TXA2/PGH2 receptor in rabbit aortic membranes and examined the influence of dexamethasone treatment on vascular TXA2/PGH2 receptor affinity and number. The binding of [125I][1S-(1 alpha,2 beta(5Z),3 alpha(1E,3R)4 alpha)]-7-[3-(3- hydroxy-4-(p-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1] heptan-2-yl]-5-heptanoic acid ([125I]BOP), a potent TXA2/PGH2 receptor agonist, to rabbit aortic membranes was saturable, displaceable, and dependent on protein concentration. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data disclosed one class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd of 0.44 +/- 0.13 nM and a Bmax of 114.4 +/- 5.2 fmol/mg protein (n = 7). Removal of the endothelium before membrane preparation did not significantly alter the affinity or number of binding sites for [125I]BOP. Kinetic analysis of the rates of [125I]BOP association/dissociation yielded a Kd of 0.62 nM. The ability of various agonists at the TXA2/PGH2 receptor to displace [125I]BOP from vascular membranes correlated well with their contractile potencies in rabbit aortic rings. Moreover, stereospecific displacement of [125I]BOP binding in aortic membranes and inhibition of U46619-mediated aortic contractions were obtained with the stereoisomers L657925(-) and L657926(+). Collectively, these data suggest that this binding site represents the functionally relevant vascular TXA2/PGH2 receptor. In functional experiments, [127I]BOP induced concentration-dependent contractions of the rabbit aorta, which were reduced by 52% in vessels from dexamethasone-treated rabbits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The metal backings of acetabular components can reduce the available polyethylene thickness, often to an alarming extent. This study indicated that the pitting and cracking of thin polyethylene surfaces have some similarities to tibial and patellar bearings and that creep-related deformation occurred more frequently in thin polyethylene components. Additionally, it appears that dimensional tolerances of the polyethylene inserts are difficult to maintain and may result in a nonuniform fit of both the femoral head into the component and the component into its own metal backing, which can lead to component separation. It is difficult to accurately measure the changes in material and mechanical properties of polyethylene over time. An additional ramification is that flaws, such as voids in the polyethylene, cannot be attributed to problems of bulk supply, fabrication, or postmanufacturing treatment. Orthopedic device manufacturers should keep samples of each lot of polyethylene used and provide components with serial numbers so that the source, composition, and properties of the original bulk material and material \"as fabricated\" can be documented. This would permit researchers studying revisions or postmortem samples to determine the changes in the polyethylene over time in vivo, thus improving the understanding of this crucial material. If manufacturers were to include dimensions and tolerances of the polyethylene inserts in their product literature, accurate measurements of wear of retrieved specimens may be possible.\r"

It also compared the results of core decompression and grafting with nonoperative management. Forty patients with Stages I-III AVN of the femoral head were treated with core decompression and grafting. All wore capacitive coupling units with electrodes placed over the femoral head continuously for six months. One-half of these units were active and one-half were inactive. Patients were followed for two to four years. Results were determined by preoperative and postoperative Harris ratings, quantitative roentgenographic measurements, and the number of hips that required total hip arthroplasty (THA). After all evaluations were completed, patients were divided into stimulated and nonstimulated groups. Patients in both groups were similar regarding gender, etiology, and roentgenographic stage of involvement. Results were also compared to 55 hips previously treated symptomatically, without surgery or electrical stimulation. There were no fractures, infections, or other significant complications in any of the hips operated on. Hips treated with decompression and grafting, both with and without electrical stimulation, were more satisfactory than hips treated symptomatically in regard to roentgenographic progression and the need for THA. There was, however, no indication that the addition of capacitive coupling gave better results than decompression and grafting alone.\r"

Using titanium screw dental implants in the jaw, a lasting interface under loaded conditions extending over a 20-year follow-up period has been demonstrated. This demonstration brings up the question whether a similar interface can be achieved in total hip arthroplasty (THA) between living bone and a titanium alloy implant under necessitated conditions of immediate loading. Two series of cases are reported. The first series used a femoral, press-fit, titanium alloy component and the second used a press-fit titanium acetabular component and redesigned femoral, press-fit, titanium alloy component. Both demonstrated a high percentage of good to excellent results. Roentgenograms showed that the geometrical changes in the redesigned femoral component gave early indications of a better fixation with loading in valgus, less subsidence, and less evidence of distal stress transfer. A two-and-one-half-year postoperative anatomic specimen study confirmed osseointegration to the press-fit titanium alloy femoral component. Multiple areas of contact between bone and metal without fibrous interposition were seen. Examination by electron microscopy supported the light microscopic findings. These findings support further use of smooth, press-fit titanium components in THAs without the need for porous coating, mesh, or other surface modifications.\r"

The correlation between clinical, roentgenographic, histologic, and biochemical loosening indicates that the canine model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of prosthetic failure.

To prevent impingement and dislocation, it was determined that the safest range for cup position was 30 degrees-50 degrees abduction and 20 degrees-40 degrees flexion from the horizontal. To measure postoperative cup position, a standing true lateral roentgenogram of the operated hip allowed direct measurement of cup flexion and was reproducible within 10 degrees. No special instruments are necessary for this technique, which can be used with any THA system.\r"

  ".U": "91059529\r", 
  ".W": "Surgical implants of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) have been found to be susceptible to abrasive wear, resulting in the well-known phenomenon of metallosis. In the presence of the acrylic debris generated by loose joint arthroplasty prostheses, this abrasive wear is greatly increased. However, the bone loss seen in these cases has generally been presumed to be due to the osteolytic effects of particulate acrylic, not the alloy debris, which has generally been assumed to be biocompatible. To examine the in vivo effects of titanium-alloy wear without the added presence of acrylic debris, a comprehensive analysis was made of cementless human joint arthroplasty prostheses with Ti-6Al-4V alloy surfaces articulating on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Specimens, including the prostheses, synovium, pseudocapsule and additional soft tissues, and periarticular bone, were retrieved from 22 hips and two knees. Specimens were examined by histologic techniques, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and electron microscopy. Serial sections of the implants were evaluated for tissue ingrowth. Tissues surrounding all joints implanted more than one year showed some degree of discoloration indicative of metallosis, whereas after two years the synovium was hypertrophic and villiform. Histologic evaluation showed good fixation by bony ingrowth in the vast majority of cases, although location and extent of ingrowth was dependent on numerous factors. Viability of ingrowth bone was established by fluorochrome labeling. However, despite good biologic fixation, cavitary osteolysis of the bone surrounding the implants was frequently identified. These lesions were filled with sheets of aggressive macrophages within a matrix of fibrous tissue and necrotic debris. Under polarized light the macrophages were found to be filled with alloy and polyethylene fragments of a characteristic size. Osteoblast-mediated remodeling of bone was infrequently observed. Instead, the bone was resorbed along a front in contact with the granulomatous tissues filling the cystic lesions. Visible burnishing was observed on every articular surface, with a linear relationship between wear and time implanted. By one year the surfaces were covered with a characteristic \"scratch and gouge\" pattern, similar on all sizes of femoral heads as well as the total knee prostheses. This study demonstrates that the combination of Ti-6Al-4V alloy and UHMWPE, when used as a bearing surface combination in total joint arthroplasty prostheses, results in excessive wear of both metal and polymer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This article reviews the important steps of a diagnostic algorithm that has been used to accurately diagnose and stage the disease process of ON. A consistent surgical technique with clearly defined goals is also outlined. The results of two clinical studies that were based on these diagnostic and therapeutic philosophies and that assess the role of core decompression in the treatment of ON are reviewed. The first study compared core decompression to conservative management in a prospective randomized study of 55 hips. Decompression provided more predictable pain relief and changed the indications for further surgical intervention more consistently than did conservative management. The second study represents a preliminary review of a ten-year study of the decompression procedure; it showed that core decompression was particularly useful in Stage I and Stage II ON. Roentgenographic stabilization was most predictable for Stage I hips. Core decompression can be a safe, effective, and predictable procedure in the treatment of Stage I and Stage II ON.\r"

Two porous-coated femoral implants of substantially different stiffnesses were designed for direct comparison. One was manufactured from cobalt-chromium (CoCr) alloy, the other from titanium alloy. The titanium stem was hollowed out to a wall thickness of 1 mm to further reduce its stiffness. The cumulative stiffness differences were about 5.4-fold axially and 3.6-fold in bending and torsion. Staged bilateral THA was performed on eight dogs. Each dog received a stiff CoCr stem on one side and a flexible titanium stem on the other. After death, the femora were removed and processed for undecalcified thin-section histology. Bone ingrowth and remodeling were quantified by computer-aided image analysis and compared between stem designs. All femoral specimens showed bone ingrowth fixation of both stiff and flexible stems along the implant length. Tetracycline labeling indicated active bone turnover in the femoral cortex and in regions of ingrowth. However, gross differences in femoral bone remodeling were observed both roentgenographically and histologically. Femora with the flexible stems consistently showed much less bone resorption than those with the stiff stems. Quantitative analysis of paired cross-sections indicated an average of 25%-35% more cortical bone area in the femora with flexible stems. Severe resorption of the cortex in the midstem region occurred in three of the femora with the stiff stems but in none with the flexible stems. Stem stiffness strongly influences bone remodeling. The flexible stem results in more uniform load transfer and less stress shielding.\r"

The problem is further complicated because the surgeon has no means of quantifying the dysplastic deformity or of predicting what a particular combination of osteotomies would do to correct the deformity. This study describes methods of quantifying hip-joint geometry in three dimensions based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance studies, and of simulating pelvic osteotomy to correct the deformities. The study analyzes 49 normal hip joints and 20 dysplastic hip joints. The results show that the normal acetabulum is nearly a full hemisphere, which is anteverted 20 degrees and abducted 53 degrees. The normal lateral center-edge angle is 37 degrees. The dysplastic acetabulum is not anterolaterally maldirected, as has been assumed, but is globally dysplastic. Analysis of the individual dysplastic hip joints showed a wide variability. Some patients were deficient globally, some anterolaterally, and some posterolaterally. Methods of analyzing a patient's hip joint, quantifying abnormalities, simulating surgery, and predicting results are demonstrated in a case example.\r"

At an average of 5.1 years (range, one to 11 years) after arthroplasty, recovery was complete for 13 palsies and partial for 12. Complete recovery was more likely in those palsies that were incomplete initially. Patients with palsies that were initially partial had significantly higher knee scores than those with complete palsies, and patients whose eventual recovery was complete had significantly higher knee scores than those with incomplete recovery. This new prognostic information should be useful for surgeons who encounter this unfortunate yet persistent complication of TKA.\r"

Seventy-three percent of patients had decreased quadriceps strength, and 60% had decreased hamstring strength. Sixty-five percent had thigh atrophy. The ROM and alignment were satisfactory. Despite the advantages of early ROM with femoral fractures treated with interlocking nails, knee function is often unsatisfactory once fracture union has occurred.

Since the infestation closely resembled a soft-tissue tumor on clinical and roentgenographic examination, the patient was treated with an incisional biopsy of the mass, which consisted of a cystic cavity filled with clear fluid. The diagnosis of an Echinococcus cyst was made only after permanent section analysis revealed numerous scoleces within the cyst lining. The patient was asymptomatic six months after cyst excision but still remains at risk for recurrence of the infestation. The present report serves to alert the reader to this rare but potentially fatal condition. Preoperative diagnosis is imperative to avoid inadvertant rupture of a hydatid cyst, which releases viable scoleces into the systemic circulation and may precipitate an anaphylactic reaction.\r"

The first stage was the standard below-knee amputation with a long posterior flap in which the fascia and skin were closed in the central portion with the medial and lateral portions of the wound left open for drainage. The second stage was delayed until closure of the open wounds three to seven days after the first stage. Wagner's classification of diabetic foot lesions was used to stratify these cases. Grades 3 and 4 foot infections had a uniformly good prognosis for healing with this surgical technique. Grade 5 foot infections had a poor prognosis for healing, especially if associated with renal failure and dialysis, even with an initial guillotine amputation.\r"

Eighteen (28%) of these patients had clinical and roentgenographic features of 41 stress fractures and 12 new spinal fractures. There were 26 periarticular, six femoral neck, three pubic rami, three tibia and fibula, one greater trochanter, and two subtrochanteric fractures. Vertebral fractures appeared first, then periarticular, then femoral neck, and lastly long-bone shaft fractures. All fractures were spontaneous in onset. The peripheral fracture rate during treatment was three times that in untreated osteoporosis. Roentgenograms must be repeated at intervals of three to four weeks before the pathognomonic callus becomes visible, and the diagnosis can be made. Trabecular stress fractures tend to occur in the first 18 months of treatment, and cortical stress fractures occur after 30 months of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Finite-element analysis was used to study the general differences in load-transfer mechanisms and stress patterns of cemented, fully ingrown, proximally ingrown, and smooth press-fitted femoral stems in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Identical stems were used for the noncemented configurations and a similar stem shape for the cemented configurations. In each model, bone properties and loading characteristics were equal. Stem elastic moduli were varied so that the effects of cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) and titanium as different stem materials could be assessed. The load-transfer mechanism is similar for all bonded configurations but differs dramatically for unbonded stems, e.g., press-fit designs. In the bonded configurations, interface stress concentrations occur on the proximal and distal sides. Stress value depends on stem rigidity, with higher proximal stress occurring in cemented stems and higher distal stress in noncemented stems. In the press-fit stem, the interface stresses are affected more by stem shape as a geometric entity and less by stem rigidity. Considering possible postoperative failure mechanisms, such as interface loosening and cortical bone loss, titanium is expected to produce better results in noncemented stems and CoCrMo in cemented stems. Cortical stress shielding as a qualitative phenomenon is caused by all stems, particularly in the calcar region. Quantitatively, stress-shielding effects differ with each type of fixation used. Stress-shielding effects are severe in fully ingrown stems and milder in cemented stems because of the differences in stem rigidity. The proximally ingrown stem falls between the fully ingrown and cemented stems in regard to stress shielding because stress transfer is more evenly distributed along the stem and concentrated at the lower coated edge. The press-fit stem provokes calcar stress shielding only. In the midstem region the stresses in the cortex are even greater than in the natural case.\r"

The major clinical features of FES include hypoxia, pulmonary edema, central nervous system depression, and axillary or subconjunctive petechiae. Improvements have been made in supporting the respiratory compromise and adult respiratory distress syndrome that these patients develop. Aggressive measures to improve the pulmonary function, i.e., positive pressure ventilation and effective fluid management, are important and expedite fixation of bone fractures.\r"

This is a report of 100 consecutive cases of total hip arthroplasties, using HA coating, which were mainly for osteoarthrosis, avascular necrosis, or revision for failed implants. The average prospective follow-up period was two years. Titanium femoral components had a proximal HA coating, usually with an HA-coated screw cup. For both HA-coated components, the average Harris hip score was 96 points after one year and 98 after two years. Analysis of data shows that the incidence of pain was low immediately after surgery and at 4% one year postoperatively. There was no difference between the results of primary cases and revisions after the one-year interval. On roentgenographic examination, there was a rapid bony integration of implants with bone apposition on the coating within six months, accompanied by specific patterns of remodeling. No radiolucent line formation was detected around HA-coated implant parts. There were no revisions for loose implants. After two years, 97% of the patients had positive roentgenographic evidence of femoral ingrowth compared to 55% for HA-coated acetabular cups, with a statistical significance between bone ingrowth and clinical results. Implant fixation using HA coatings is a reliable procedure for good bony fixation and clinical results.\r"

Failures were largely related to inadequate femoral canal filling. Because of refinements in implant design and surgical techniques, a press fit of the implant is currently achieved in 94% of cases compared to 36% during the first five years. Porous-coated femoral components have yielded results equivalent to those with cement in primary THAs. Excellent results were observed in relatively young patients and patients with revisions.\r"

Fixed stems had much less particulate debris in soft tissues. The data showed that failure of most metal hip stems was initially due to a mechanical cause, with high debris and ion counts occurring secondarily in capsule and fibrous membranes. Particulate debris and high ion readings are primarily a focal problem contained by the periprosthetic fibrous connective-tissue encapsulation within the femoral canal and joint capsules. No systemic problems were manifest in any of the patients examined and followed in this study.\r"

HA-1A serum levels were measured before infusion and frequently after infusion with a radiometric assay. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fit to the measured serum levels, and accurately described the changes in HA-1A level over time in each dose group (r2 = .99). The mean +/- SEM apparent volume of distribution of HA-1A was 48.5 +/- 4.5 ml/kg, and the mean serum clearance was 2.8 +/- 0.4 ml/kg.h. The mean serum half-life of HA-1A was 15.9 +/- 1.5 h. The mean serum level one hour after a 100-mg dose was 33.2 +/- 2.4 micrograms/ml, and the mean concentration 24 h later was 9.1 +/- 1.6 micrograms/ml. The dose administered and presence of Gram-negative bacterial infection did not significantly influence the volume of distribution or serum clearance. No adverse reactions to HA-1A were observed, and no antibodies against HA-1A were detected in any patient. These data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of HA-1A are well described by a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, and that HA-1A is safe and nonimmunogenic in patients with sepsis.\r"

Despite initial low O2 extr, VO2 can be increased in pediatric septic shock by a further increase in DO2. Since VO2 correlates with survival, one should consider enhancing DO2 further despite initial low O2 extr and high DO2. Effects on morbidity and mortality require further study.\r"

A pilot study of continuous hemofiltration using a high-performance membrane was conducted in 16 such patients in an attempt to decrease the serum levels of the middle molecules. The procedure was used alternately with plasma exchange. High-performance liquid chromatography showed a notable removal of the substances in the filtrates and a sequential removal from the serum by hemofiltration. Eight (50%) of the 16 patients had amelioration in level of consciousness and were weaned successfully from hemofiltration. Although only three of the 16 patients survived the acute illness, 13 others lived an average of 15 days and five patients survived greater than 3 wk. While the continuous removal of middle molecules from the serum may not reverse liver failure, this procedure used in conjunction with plasma exchange may provide a means of life support, e.g., for patients awaiting a liver transplant.\r"

These patients were investigated to identify early variables that could predict outcome. There were 15 survivors (group A) and 11 nonsurvivors (group B). As a mean, group A patients were hemodynamically evaluated 2.3 h after onset of the sepsis syndrome, whereas group B patients underwent cardiac catheterization after a 12-h interval. At the initial evaluation, both groups demonstrated similarly decreased mean arterial pressure, mean heart rate, and mean cardiac filling pressure. Only group A patients evidenced elevated cardiac index (CI) (greater than 4 L/min.m2) associated with low systemic vascular resistance index (less than 7400 dyne.sec/cm5.m2), which is generally recognized as hyperdynamic cardiac state. However, none of the initial cardiovascular variables could serve as a predictor for survival. Fluid challenge increased left ventricular preload from 6 to 12.4 and from 7.8 to 12.7 mm Hg in group A and group B, respectively. The increases were associated with significant increases in CI from 4.4 to 6.9 and from 3 to 3.8 L/min.m2. However, at the end of fluid challenge, only group A patients exhibited normal cardiac response, as evidenced by the change in left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) for a given increase in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) that was referred to as left cardiac preload.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The database includes a retrospective analysis of 318 patients managed with pulmonary artery catheters during 1986 to 1988. For comparison, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was computed for these patients. CCSS includes a total of 17 variables with a weighted score of 71. The mortality rates for increases by 5 points were observed and were statistically significant (p less than .0001). The same was not true for APACHE II. Although neither of the scores could predict ICU days, both reflected the number of life-threatening complications. Serial CCSS that was computed at 24 +/- 4 h (CCSS-C) provided documentation for improvement in patient condition secondary to therapeutic interventions. Statistically improved mortality prediction was observed with CCSS-C. Since 70 (45.7%) of 153 patients died with an APACHE II score less than 14, it appears that this score is deficient in a specific group of patients, i.e., those requiring invasive monitoring. For patients with circulatory or respiratory failure, CCSS may offer a better tool to predict mortality and evaluate therapy.\r"

During a 5-yr period (1984 to 1989), 484 previously healthy patients were admitted to the hospital with RSV infection. No differences were found in the presenting symptoms of respiratory distress, cough, fever or shock, although the premature group was more likely to present with apnea (p less than .001). Chest roentgenograms revealed that premature infants had a higher incidence of atelectasis/infiltrate and hyperinflation (p less than .05). Premature infants had longer hospital stays as well as a higher Physiologic Stability Index and Therapeutic Intervention Score (p less than .001). They were also more likely to receive supplemental oxygen, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and nothing by mouth status (p less than .001). We conclude that premature birth increases the risk of more severe and prolonged RSV disease.\r"

Artery cannulation was successfully accomplished in 73 (95%) cases and lasted for a mean of 6 days. Sixty percent of the catheters were inserted on the first attempt. Fifty-two (71%) patients weighed less than 10 kg and 55 (75%) patients were less than 12 months old. Fifty-one (70%) patients received inotropic support at the time of cannulation, and 27 (37%) eventually died from causes unrelated to catheter insertion. There was one episode each of line-associated infection and transient distal ischemia not resulting in tissue loss, and two episodes of catheter malfunction. In eight (11%) patients, signs of distal vascular insufficiency developed shortly catheter placement and resolved after catheter removal. The development of this complication correlated significantly (p less than .05) with younger age (5.5 vs. 22.3 months). We conclude that femoral artery cannulation has a high degree of success in very small, critically ill children. It should be considered an acceptable alternative to small-vessel cannulation when the latter is not technically achievable, or in the unstable patient where rapid establishment of reliable arterial access is necessary.\r"

Salbutamol caused improvement in total respiratory system compliance and in airflow resistance. There was no correlation between salbutamol serum concentration and pulmonary function. Elimination half-time appears to be dictated in these infants more by the distribution volume (Vd) than by clearance (Cl). The area under concentration-time curve of salbutamol correlated inversely to the change in heart rate (HR). There was a significant positive correlation between Vd and percent HR change. These data provide evidence that preterm infants have measurable activity of bronchiolar beta 2 receptor responsive to salbutamol.\r"

Patients without recorded arrhythmias (22%, n = 621) were used as control subjects. No clinical group was free from cardiac arrhythmias. Atrial tachyarrhythmias had the highest prevalence in the population as a whole (28%) and in all clinical groups except multiple trauma. Atrial fibrillation was the most common atrial arrhythmia (52%); ventricular arrhythmias followed. Patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias, nodal rhythm ventricular bradyarrhythmias, and ventricular rapid rhythms had significantly (p less than .01) increased mortality rates (40%, 44%, 77%, and 51%, respectively) when compared with patients without arrhythmias (35%). The relative risk of dying (RRD) of these clinical groups was increased by 1.16, 1.27, 2.20, and 1.47, respectively. Patients with cardiorespiratory precipitating disease and any arrhythmia except atrial bradyarrhythmia had a mortality rate between 32% and 74%, significantly (p less than .05) different from that of patients within the same clinical groups without arrhythmias. The RRD was increased by 1.67 to 3.40. Septic patients with atrial tachyarrhythmia or nodal rhythm and neurologic patients with nodal or ventricular arrhythmias also had significantly (p less than .01 and .05, respectively) increased mortality and were at higher RRD (1.53 to 2.81). Our data suggest that severe illness may be present in some clinical groups of critically ill patients with cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

Results show that closed suctioning is associated with a significant (67% vs. 39% p less than .02) increase in colonization compared with open suctioning. However, difference in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was not significantly (26% vs. 29%) different between closed and open suctioning. Differences in severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), age, sex, presence of NG tubes, use of H2 antagonists or antacids, use of antibiotics, and history of smoking were all nonsignificant. Survival analysis demonstrated that the probability of survival without developing nosocomial pneumonia was greater among closed-suctioning patients vs. open-suctioned patients (p less than .03). This study shows that suctioning performed via the Trach Care closed-suction system increases the incidence of colonization but not the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, and may actually decrease mortality when compared with open-suction systems.\r"

We evaluated the effect of WEB 2086 on HPV in an intact animal. Pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and had their hemodynamic variables monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and arterial line. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. Initial studies determined that PAF (0.03 to 1.0 micrograms) injected iv dose-dependently increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with a 262 +/- 58% increase in PVR 5 min after a dose of 1.0 microgram. WEB 2086 (25 mg/kg iv) completely blocked the increase in PVR caused by iv PAF. Additionally, indomethacin (2 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg.h iv) treatment of the animals attenuated the PAF-induced increase in PVR. To evaluate the effect of WEB 2086 on HPV, animals were alternately ventilated with 21% oxygen and 10-min periods of 10% oxygen to induce HPV. After three initial control episodes of hypoxic ventilation, WEB 2086 (25 mg/kg) was injected iv and two more episodes of ventilation with 10% oxygen were given. During the three control HPV episodes the increases in PVR were 80 +/- 10%, 108 +/- 10%, and 107 +/- 22% (n = 5). After WEB 2086, the increase in PVR during two episodes of hypoxia were 96 +/- 28% and 99 +/- 19%, respectively, which was not significantly different from the control response to hypoxia. We conclude that iv PAF dose dependently increases PVR in pigs, and can be blocked by WEB 2086, that its effect is partially mediated through cyclooxygenase products, and that PAF does not appear to mediate HPV in this species.\r"

After the administration of nitrendipine, the kidneys were rendered ischemic for one hour by cross-clamping the renal vessels.

High-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used to quantify the endogenous NE released and that remaining in the tissue after stimulation. Endotoxin (1 micrograms/ml and 10 micrograms/ml in superfusate) had no effect on the release of NE from either pulmonary artery or portal vein. Endotoxin also had no effect on vasoactivity in response to ES. Thus, in isolated pulmonary artery and portal vein, endotoxin, in the doses employed, does not directly affect release of NE from adrenergic nerve endings, nor does it affect the sequence of events that starts with transmitter-receptor interaction and ends with contraction of smooth muscle cells.\r"

Accuracy for the estimated method by finger palpation was 69% for high pressures, 58% for normal pressures, and 73% for low pressures. We observed differences in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive power between different tubes reflecting differences in tube characteristics and interobserver variability.

Significant differences in posttrial values for the following variables were: a) PetCO2 (31.2 +/- 9.1 vs. 25.6 +/- 8.2 torr, p less than .001); b) PaCO2 (38.0 +/- 4.9 vs. 33.2 +/- 6.7 torr, p less than .01); and c) pH (7.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.1, p less than .04) at comparable Paw (9.5 +/- 7.6 vs. 8.0 +/- 6.0, NS). Eighty-four percent (21/25) of infants in the VCR group had normal PaCO2 values (35 to 45 torr) while only 44% (11/25) in the SIR group achieved normocarbia (p less than .001). Measurements of the highest (Pmax) and lowest (Pmin) inspiratory pressure (cm H2O) in 15 patients demonstrated marked variation in Pmax with the SIR. Differences in Pmax (SIR minus VCR) were significant (10.8 +/- 3.7, p less than .02) but not in Pmin (0.5 +/- 3.5, NS). Our study demonstrates that ventilation with the VCR resulted in less hyperventilation with minimal pressure variability as compared with the SIR. Further studies in the neonate are warranted.\r"

The major route of transmitting such HIV infection is via blood collected during the interval between infection of the donor and development of a detectable circulating antibody level to the AIDS virus (i.e., the \"window period\"). The current risk to hemophiliacs receiving treated coagulation factor concentrates is negligible. The risk to healthcare personnel of acquiring HIV infection from accidental puncture wounds and from handling HIV-infected blood or body fluids is 0.42% per episode. Most reported seroconversions have resulted from penetrating injuries with sharp objects contaminated with HIV-positive blood. The degree of risk to healthcare workers will vary with the community, the patient population served, and the frequency of penetrating injuries.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of adult patients hospitalized for exacerbation of asthma. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial throughout the study. SETTING: University Hospital Clinical Research Center. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients admitted from the emergency room with a primary diagnosis asthma; 39 patients completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either intravenous aminophylline or placebo in addition to frequent nebulized albuterol; prednisone 0.5 mg/kg body weight every 6 h orally; and supplemental oxygen. Aminophylline infusion rates were adjusted to achieve serum theophylline concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml. Changes were made in placebo infusion rates to maintain the double blind design. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and other spirometric measurements every 8 h by a blinded investigator or trained respiratory therapist. Subjective patient response and duration of hospitalization were compared. No difference in spirometric measurements was observed between the two groups at any time point. On admission to the study, FEV1 in the placebo group was 41.5 (+/- 2.9) percent predicted and in the aminophylline group 34.7 (+/- 2.3) percent predicted (p = 0.08). At discharge, FEV1 was 70.4 (+/- 2.9) percent predicted in the placebo group and 63.7 (+/- 2.8) percent predicted in the theophylline group (p = 0.10). There was no difference in subjective patient rating or duration of hospitalization between the two groups (placebo 1.95 days and aminophylline 1.78 days, p = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that aminophylline therapy does not add significant benefit to other standard therapies in hospitalized adult asthmatic patients. Because of the risks and cost of aminophylline treatment in the hospital setting, further research is needed to determine if there are subgroups of adult asthmatics who may benefit from the addition of aminophylline to other standard optimal therapies.\r"

  ".W": "Although fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) has been traditionally used to evaluate nonresolving pneumonia, its efficacy is unknown. We, therefore, reviewed FOB in 35 consecutive patients who had (1) a roentgenographic infiltrate, (2) cough, (3) either temperature greater than 38.1 degrees C, leukocytosis, sputum production, (4) symptoms present for at least ten days, and antibiotic therapy for at least one week. Known lung cancer and AIDS were excluded. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 86 percent (12/14) in whom a specific cause was found. No patient had endobronchial cancer. Two patients with nondiagnostic FOB and persistent systemic symptoms had open lung biopsy specimens showing Wegener's granulomatosis and bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Twenty-one patients with nondiagnostic FOB had no final diagnoses other than community-acquired pneumonia. We conclude that FOB is extremely useful in finding a specific diagnosis for a nonresolving pneumonia when a specific diagnosis can be made. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was most likely to yield a specific diagnosis in nonsmoking patients with multilobar infiltrates of long duration and could have been avoided in older, smoking, or otherwise compromised patients with lobar or segmental infiltrates with no decrease in diagnostic yield in our series.\r"

A total of 281 procedures performed during a 12-month period at a VA medical center were reviewed. Ninety-one procedures performed without premedication were compared with 190 procedures performed with premedication. Complications occurred in 5 percent of patients in each group. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in age, spirometry, P(A-a)O2 or SaO2 between both groups. Despite the proven safety of outpatient FOB without sedation, many bronchoscopists administer complicated premedication regimens and employ ambulatory surgery beds or recovery rooms to monitor patients before and after procedures. These results support a simplified approach to routine FOB which would include no premedications and greater use of outpatient facilities resulting in decreased expenditures without compromising patient care, safety or comfort.\r"

In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with CHF who received PAC, while there was no difference in patients with cardiogenic shock or persistent hypotension. Mortality in patients receiving PAC was higher irrespective of the presence or absence of \"pump failure.\" A separate analysis of discharge summaries of 364 patients with CHF showed that PAC was used more frequently in sicker patients and that when severity of CHF was assessed, no difference in mortality was found in patients with mild or moderate CHF. We conclude that while a higher in-hospital mortality is found in patients receiving PAC, this excess is likely related to difference in severity of CHF, which had not been assessed in every individual. It is unlikely that PAC increases mortality.\r"

Treatment in group 1 comprised positioning, vibrations, hyperinflation, and suction, and in group 2, treatment consisted of hyperinflation and suction alone. Treatment in either group was given hourly for six hours. Patients in group 1 had a significantly higher mean percentage resolution of their atelectasis (mean value, 60.1 percent), as seen on chest roentgenogram, after one treatment intervention than patients in group 2 (mean value, 7.6 percent; p less than .006). After the intensive six-hour treatment period, the difference between the groups was marginally statistically significant, still favoring group 1 over group 2 (p less than .055). Follow-up roentgenograms at 24 and 48 hours revealed no significant difference between the treatment groups (p greater than .10 and greater than .20, respectively). These results suggest that, at least initially in the course of acute lobar atelectasis, positioning and vibrations add to the efficacy of a treatment of hyperinflation and suction alone.\r"

  ".W": "A simplified sleep apnea investigation consisting of combined oximetry and respiration movement monitoring was compared with conventional polysomnography. These two types of recordings were performed simultaneously during one night in 77 patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). A static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) was used in the simplified recording because it provides a comfortable and reliable means of recording respiration movements. Periods of obstructive apneas gave a diamond-shaped periodic respiration movement pattern in the SCSB, usually accompanied by repetitive oxygen desaturations. The average number of desaturations greater than or equal to 4 percent per sleeping hour was termed the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and compared with the apnea index (AI). In the whole population they were well correlated (p less than 0.0001, R2 = 0.41), but in individual cases there were considerable discrepancies. Patients with periodic respiration movements less than 18 percent of total sleeping time and ODI less than 2 never had AI greater than or equal to 5, whereas patients with periodic respiration greater than 45 percent and ODI greater than 6 always had AI greater than or equal to 5. Fifty-one of the 77 patients fulfilled these criteria. A bradycardia response to apneas was absent in 29 percent of patients with AI greater than or equal to 5. A combination of respiration movement and oximetry recording thus seems to give sufficient information to confirm or negate a diagnosis of OSAS in a majority of patients with clinical symptoms. In borderline patients, further investigations should be performed.\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that differences in peak tidal volume during exercise between patients with different cardiorespiratory diseases are related largely to differences in severity of respiratory mechanical impairment (vital capacity), not to differences in disease state. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, bronchial asthma, and heart disease (mitral valve disease or left ventricular dysfunction) were studied. Subjects selected had one and only one of the above diagnoses. All subjects performed maximal (symptom-limited) incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer. Multiple linear regression of all subjects (n = 30) in all four groups showed a significant correlation between VTmax and VC: VTmax = 0.55, VC -0.09 L (r = 0.827, p less than 0.0001). The VTmax/VC (x 100) was (mean +/- SD) 44 +/- 15, 54 +/- 11, 56 +/- 11, and 54 +/- 12 for the COPD, RLD, BA and HD patients respectively. There was no significant difference between any of the groups. We concluded that differences in VTmax between different patients are related largely to differences in VC (ie, differences in severity of respiratory mechanical impairment), not to differences in disease state. Measurement of VTmax or the VTmax/VC ratio has little value in the differential diagnosis of exertional dyspnea.\r"

The children were assessed on arrival, and on disposition from the Emergency Room by one of the investigators. After obtaining historic data, a clinical score was assigned, and oxygen saturation and pulmonary function were measured. Of the 134 (67 percent) children who were discharged home from the Emergency Room, five returned within seven days and one was subsequently admitted. The clinical score on disposition was the sole variable found to best predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 73 percent, specificity 95 percent). Of the variables obtained at presentation, the resulting decision tree found the clinical score to predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 79 percent, specificity 75 percent). When the individual components of the clinical score were analyzed, the degree of dyspnea, as assessed by the investigator, was chosen as the rule to predict the hospitalization decision (sensitivity 88 percent, specificity 71 percent). We conclude that the decision with respect to the need for hospitalization in acute childhood asthma, is in practice based mainly on careful clinical evaluation. Pulmonary function and SaO2 measurements, although helpful adjuncts in the assessment of acute asthma, do not appear to contribute to the identification of patients who need hospital admission.\r"

There was no significant difference between HT+ and HT- patients with respect to age, weight, BMI, sleep stage distribution and disorganization, apnea-hypopnea index (number of episodes per hour of sleep) and duration (minutes per hour of sleep) nor O2 saturation indices: mean nocturnal and minimum O2 saturation. We conclude therefore that HT in SAS patients is not directly related to morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and breathing abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Inhaled pentamidine is used commonly to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. Case reports indicate that PCP can recur in patients who receive inhaled pentamidine and that clinical features may be atypical. To determine the magnitude of this problem, we reviewed retrospectively the medical records of patients with proven PCP during a 30-month period at two hospitals. Four (31 percent) of 13 patients with previous PCP who received inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis had recurrent P carinii infection, including one patient with widely metastatic extrapulmonary disease. Chest roentgenographic findings included cavities, pneumothoraces, bilateral and upper lobe interstitial infiltrates, and pleural effusion. False-negative bronchoalveolar lavage and induced sputum examinations were frequent. We conclude that recurrent PCP in patients maintained on a regimen of inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis occurs frequently, causes chest roentgenographic abnormalities other than interstitial infiltrates, and may be difficult to diagnose. Clinicians who choose to use this effective and convenient mode of prophylaxis should be aware of the problems attendant to its use.\r"

A total lidocaine dose of 3.2 to 8.5 (mean +/- SEM = 5.7 +/- 0.5) mg/kg was administered to nose, larynx and bronchial tree over 9 to 45 (mean +/- SEM = 20 +/- 2.7) minutes. No complication occurred during the procedure. Peak SLC were 1-3.5 (mean +/- SEM = 2.5 +/- 0.2) micrograms/ml. The Vd beta was 1.79 +/- 0.19 L/kg, the t1/2 beta was 109 +/- 12 minutes, and the total body clearance 12.2 +/- 1.1 ml/min/kg. Peak SLC correlated well with the dose expressed as mg/kg (r = 0.59, p less than 0.025), and even better when related to body surface area (r = 0.63, p less than 0.01). Lidocaine doses up to 8.5 mg/kg proved safe and resulted in therapeutic SLC in our patients. Lidocaine dose up to 7 mg/kg appears to be safe provided that it does not exceed an upper limit of 175 mg/m2 and is gradually administered over a minimum of 15 minutes. Doses of 7-8.5 mg/kg appear to be safe when administered over longer periods.\r"

Leads V1 and V3 each had a clearly lower specificity that ranged from 56 to 67 percent. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the optimal interpretation of the exercise ECG included the limb leads and V4 to V6, but not V1 to V3. The results of coronary angiography in the subset of 16 patients who underwent this procedure confirmed these findings.\r"

The intraoperative and postoperative use of blood and blood products, as well as the chest tube drainage in the first 24 hours postoperatively, were compared in the seven patients operated on since June 1988 with the nine patients operated on before that date. Significant (p less than 0.05) reductions were demonstrated in the intraoperative and postoperative transfusion of packed cells, in the postoperative administration of fresh frozen plasma, and in the chest tube drainage within the first 24 hours postoperatively. The one-month and total hospital mortality rates were 6 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively. It is concluded that newer techniques to obtain optimal posterior mediastinal hemostasis have significantly reduced blood loss following heart-lung transplantation in our experience and have contributed to our excellent early postoperative results.\r"

  ".W": "While the outcome of in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest has been studied extensively, the clinical antecedents of arrest are less well defined. We studied a group of consecutive general hospital ward patients developing cardiopulmonary arrest. Prospectively determined definitions of underlying pathophysiology, severity of underlying disease, patient complaints, and clinical observations were used to determine common clinical features. Sixty-four patients arrested 161 +/- 26 hours following hospital admission. Pathophysiologic alterations preceding arrest were classified as respiratory in 24 patients (38 percent), metabolic in 7 (11 percent), cardiac in 6 (9 percent), neurologic in 4 (6 percent), multiple in 17 (27 percent), and unclassified in 6 (9 percent). Patients with multiple disturbances had mainly respiratory (39 percent) and metabolic (44 percent) disorders. Fifty-four patients (84 percent) had documented observations of clinical deterioration or new complaints within eight hours of arrest. Seventy percent of all patients had either deterioration of respiratory or mental function observed during this time. Routine laboratory tests obtained before arrest showed no consistent abnormalities, but vital signs showed a mean respiratory rate of 29 +/- 1 breaths per minute. The prognoses of patients' underlying diseases were classified as ultimately fatal in 26 (41 percent), nonfatal in 23 (36 percent), and rapidly fatal in 15 (23 percent). Five patients (8 percent) survived to hospital discharge. Patients developing arrest on the general hospital ward services have predominantly respiratory and metabolic derangements immediately preceding their arrests. Their underlying diseases are generally not rapidly fatal. Arrest is frequently preceded by a clinical deterioration involving either respiratory or mental function. These features and the high mortality associated with arrest suggest that efforts to predict and prevent arrest might prove beneficial.\r"

Percutaneous FNB of metastases is much easier to learn than transthoracic needle aspiration: the superficial target is anchored and sampled with multiple passes using a short needle grasped directly in the fingers. It is fast, accurate, economical and nearly free of risk and pain. The technique saves time and money because it is the only procedure needed by many patients with palpable disease in stage IIIB and IV. Bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration and open surgical biopsy thus can be avoided in most patients with palpable metastases. Prompt diagnosis by FNB of metastases speeds palliation for patients with urgent need. Tumor cell type from FNB correlated with cytologic findings from sputum samples, bronchoscopy specimens and autopsy results.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding local pulmonary immunoregulatory mechanism(s) in patients with carcinoma of the lung is an important step towards the development of innovative methods of treatment. Prostaglandin E2 plays an integral role in immunoregulation. Therefore, we evaluated PGE2 concentrations in BALF from 18 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, compared to that from six patients with pulmonary diseases other than carcinoma and ten normal smokers of similar age. The level of PGE2 in patients with lung carcinoma (158.1 +/- 88.7 pg/ml) was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than the other two groups (16.2 +/- 6.9 and 4.4 +/- 3.4 pg/ml). Levels of PGE2 also varied among patients with carcinoma of different cell types. Patients with SQCA had significantly (p less than 0.001) higher levels of PGE2 (242.7 +/- 29.4 pg/ml) than patients with ADCA or SCCA (82.3 +/- 27.9 and 66.3 +/- 15.2 pg/ml, respectively). Furthermore, there was a marked difference in PGE2 concentration between carcinomatous lung and clinically noninvolved lung in patients with SQCA and ADCA. Further study is warranted to determine the interactions between PGE2 and other cytokines (interleukin-1, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor), as well as the activity of cytolytic lymphocytes (LAK cells) in the lungs of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

Due care was taken to remove factors which could interfere with results. Of the tests concerned with the parasympathetic system, the intravenous atropine test (p greater than 0.10) and heart rate response to standing (p greater than 0.01) which measured the basal parasympathetic tone, did not show a significant difference. Tests requiring stimulation of the parasympathetic system, ie, deep breathing test (p less than 0.001), Valsalva maneuver (p less than 0.001), and carotid sinus massage (p less than 0.001) showed significantly heightened response. Postural fall of blood pressure (p greater than 0.10) and sustained hand grip test (p greater than 0.10), chiefly concerned with the sympathetic system, did not show a significant difference. Of the 50 asthmatic patients, nine were atopic and 41 nonatopic. When the results were compared in the two groups separately, we found that there was no alteration in the measurements except the intravenous atropine test which showed heightened response with atopic subjects (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the parasympathetic system is an important factor in producing bronchial spasm in asthmatic patients, and atopic and nonatopic subjects do not differ much in their autonomic status.\r"
