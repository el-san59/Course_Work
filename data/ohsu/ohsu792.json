At 19 d postinfection (dpi) the proportions of larvae persisting in the intestines as adult worms were 52 +/- 2% (means +/- SEM) for Zn-, 39.5 +/- 2.5% for pair-fed Zn- (Zn-PF), and 31.6 +/- 3.2% for Zn+ (p less than 0.001, analysis of variance); some Zn- rats were then transferred to the zinc-adequate diet [This was the zinc-repleted group (ZnR).] Both groups retained a group of pair-fed controls (Zn-PF and ZnRPF). Between 19 and 28 dpi ZnR animals gained weight faster than did Zn- animals and had heavier thymuses relative to body weight. Zinc deficiency enhances the establishment of S ratti larvae in the intestine of rats and alters the characteristics of intestinal expulsion of the nematodes; however, spontaneous cure was achieved by 38 dpi in both Zn- and control groups.\r"

Protein and energy intakes were low in the majority of patients. Of all patients, 59.6% had severe reduction in triceps skinfold thickness (TSF thickness, less than or equal to 60% of normal), whereas midarm muscle circumference (MAMC) was mildly reduced (less than or equal to 90%) in 23%. Serum IGF-I proved superior to the other indices in predicting TSF thickness. A serum IGF-I concentration of 300 micrograms/L discriminated between wasted (TSF thickness less than or equal to 60%) and robust patients. In 16 patients with a history of recent infection, IGF-I was significantly reduced well before changes in anthropometric measurements could be detected. IGF-I is a useful and early marker of undernutrition in HD patients.\r"

In blacks, JP significantly underpredicted (2.95%) and DW overpredicted (1.74%) D2O %BF with the Lange caliper. With the Holtain caliper DW successfully predicted D2O %BF (r = 0.91, SEE = 3.8%). In whites, DW overpredicted D2O %BF more than in blacks (4.94% vs 1.74%). Lower triceps-subscapular and thigh-subscapular skinfold-thickness ratios in black females and lower suprailiac-subscapular ratios in black males and females were found. It was concluded that blacks may have more visceral and upper-body fat deposition.\r"

This study compares two improved four-compartment (water, protein, mineral, and fat) models that differ in expense, technological complexity, and radiation exposure. Primary data (from 31 subjects) for the first model were derived by dual-photon absorptiometry, 3H2O dilution, and hydrodensitometry and for the second model by delayed and prompt gamma neutron-activation analysis and 3H2O dilution. Estimates of fat, protein, and mineral from the first model were highly correlated with those from the second model (r = 0.98, 0.72, and 0.94, respectively; all p less than 0.001). The proportions of body weight represented by water, protein, mineral, and fat for the simpler first model (0.532, 0.155, 0.048, and 0.265) were similar to compartment fractions provided by the more complex and costly second model (0.532, 0.143, 0.046, and 0.279). Multicompartment body composition models can thus be developed from increasingly available techniques that compare favorably with similar results derived from limited-access instrumentation.\r"

Although the relative weight of restrained eaters was found to be higher (BMI 21.1 +/- 1.3 vs 20.0 +/- 1.3 kg/m2, p less than 0.03), the self-reported energy consumption of the restrained eaters, when adjusted for body composition and height, totaled approximately 410 kcal/d less energy than that of the unrestrained group (p less than 0.002). Correspondingly, the adjusted EE was found to be lower by 620 kcal/d in restrained eaters (p less than 0.005). In both groups metabolic indices of starvation (beta-hydroxybutyric acid and triiodothyronine) were in the normal range. Neither these nor weight changed from the beginning to the end of the 14-d observation period. Thus, the lower EE of the restrained group reflects diminished caloric requirements and is not an adaptive response to a temporary decrease in food intake.\r"

Weight and calorie intake were significantly less after RYGB than after HGP after 6 mo (p less than or equal to 0.01). Protein intake was significantly increased at all intervals after RYGB and at 6 and 12 mo after HGP (p less than 0.05). After RYGB, intakes of SWS, MIC, and HCL were significantly decreased at all intervals (p less than 0.05). SWS and MIC consumption was also significantly less after RYGB than after HGP (p less than or equal to 0.05). Decreased SWS and MIC consumption in RYGB patients suggests that food-preference differences are partially responsible for the lower calorie intake and greater weight loss after RYGB than after HGP.\r"

Numerous correlations were also found between EEG indices and indices of thiamin, riboflavin, and iron nutriture. Certain observations, such as a decrement in alpha-wave activity in the EEG of subjects with low thiamin status, suggest that subtle neuropsychological impairment can occur in association with mild deficits in nutrition status. Other findings indicate that EEG frequency responses of older subjects with high iron status are similar to those of younger persons; however, these data are more difficult to interpret. The results suggest that further research on nutrition and neuropsychological function will lead to a better understanding of the role of nutrition in maintaining the functional integrity of the aging brain.\r"

Each of these groups--cancerous, corresponding noncancerous, and mammoplasty specimens--were divided into subgroups according to their receptor levels. Fourteen of the 104 noncancerous specimens were found to be ER positive (ER+). Most cases of ER+ noncancerous tissue (13 of 14 cases) were associated with ER+ tumors. The reverse was not true because only 13 of 64 cases of the ER+ tumors were associated with positive ER in their noncancerous counterparts. Comparable results were obtained for PR.

The authors compared the results of DNA quantitation of fresh and frozen tissue touch preparations in 59 solid tumors. For 54 cases there was excellent correlation. In three cases with multiple aneuploid peaks, the same populations were identified by each method, but different proportions of cells from each stemline were present in the fresh and frozen samples. In two cases there was a discrepancy between the DNA indices; the imprints showed different cell morphologic characteristics, suggesting different stemlines or areas of tumor differentiation. The authors conclude that DNA quantitation from touch preparations of frozen tissue by image cytometry provides a desirable alternative to sacrificing formalin-fixed tissue.\r"

Immunophenotypically these cases were defined by early B-lymphocyte differentiation (TdT, HLA-DR, and CD19) coexpressed with a myeloid receptor (CD13, CD15, or CD33) on the same leukemic cell. Routine cytochemical evaluation demonstrated punctate positivity of the blasts with naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase stain in five of seven cases. Cytogenetic analysis revealed structural abnormalities of chromosome 11 in four of the seven cases. Three of these studies showed a break at 11q23-24, the location of the human proto-oncogene ets-1. Clinically, two of these leukemias represented chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and all cases behaved aggressively. The authors' data suggest that mixed lineage leukemias are an identifiable subset of adult acute leukemias and are associated with a poor prognosis.\r"

Fifteen of 48 cases with multiple positive biopsies showed major differences, with 9 cases resulting in a discrepant malignancy grade. A discordant low grade was found in the bone marrow of seven cases. Two patients with rapidly progressive bone marrow insufficiency had a reversed pattern. One patient with a composite lymphoma also had disseminated high-grade lymphoma. In 4 of 22 patients with a follicle center cell lymphoma, bone marrow histologic characteristics suggested immunocytoma. The available data suggest that most differences between bone marrow and lymph node biopsies are caused by tumor heterogeneity. Morphologic evaluation of this heterogeneity may be of help in the treatment of individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated two platelet infusion pump systems, the Abbott Lifecare 5000 and the Omniflow 4000, for evidence of in vitro platelet damage and in vivo platelet recovery. When compared with gravity infusion, there was no significant difference in levels of LDH discharge, beta-thromboglobulin release, cell counts, or morphology score after platelet concentrates were infused through these pumps. When the pumps were compared to gravity infusion in thrombocytopenic oncology patients, no differences were noted in platelet-corrected count increments at 1-4 hours or 12-24 hours post-transfusion. The authors conclude that these infusion systems do not significantly injure or activate platelets and that they are efficacious for transfusing platelet concentrates to thrombocytopenic patients. These infusion pumps may be of clinical benefit to pediatric or adult patients with a history of prior transfusion reactions, when precise control of the rate and volume of platelet transfusion is desired.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews the epidemiology, management, and outcome of 71 quadruplet pregnancies that occurred between 1980 and 1989. A study of detailed medical questionnaires and medical records revealed that 67 (94%) of the pregnancies followed ovulation induction therapy. A majority of the pregnancies were diagnosed by 9.3 weeks' gestation and bed rest was instituted by 16.7 weeks; 14% of women had cervical cerclages. Tocolytic agents were used in 59 (83%) of the group beginning at 24.5 weeks' gestation. The mean gestational age at delivery was 31.4 weeks and the mean birth weight was 1482 gm. Cesarean sections were performed in 89% of the cases. The average maternal weight gain was 45.8 pounds. Of the 284 fetuses, there were six first-trimester losses (including one ectopic pregnancy), 10 stillbirths and 33 neonatal deaths, resulting in a stillbirth rate of 29 per 1000, and corrected neonatal and perinatal mortality rates of 37 per 1000 and 67 per 1000, respectively. Other than premature labor, the most common maternal complications were first-trimester bleeding (35%), toxemia (32%), and anemia (25%). The quadruplet fetal growth curve parallels the singleton 25th percentile until 34 weeks, when it drops below the 10th percentile. These data suggest that a majority of quadruplets are delivered after 28 weeks and a viable outcome is expected. Because of retarded growth after 34 weeks, delivery should be considered at 34 weeks in most cases.\r"

Women were questioned regarding timing, influence of others, reasons for their choice, satisfaction with the decision, etc. Results from 160 respondents showed that over half the women identified themselves as the primary decision maker. Physicians exerted more influence on the decisions of patients at the public hospital than on the patients at the private hospital. Overall, social exigencies appeared to play a more important role than an assessment of the medical risks in making these decisions.\r"

The criteria for this substage exceed the generally accepted criteria for microinvasion. Fifty patients with early invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated from 1976 through 1983 with a cone biopsy followed by a radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. These patients were reviewed to evaluate the ability to make the histologic diagnosis and to examine the natural history of the disease with maximal treatment. Histologically positive margins were found at the time of cone biopsy in 66% (33/50) of the patients. Negative margins at the time of cone biopsy were identified in 34% (17/50) of the patients. Residual invasive disease at the time of radical hysterectomy was found in 24% (4/17) of the patients with negative margins. Two of the 50 patients had positive lymph nodes. Three patients had recurrent metastatic disease. This study demonstrates that a preoperative diagnosis of stage IA2 invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is a difficult diagnosis to establish and creates a therapeutic dilemma regarding treatment.\r"

The average duration of pregnancy after cerclage in nine patients was 11.8 weeks (range, 1 to 18 weeks). The mean birth weight was 2456 gm (range, 810 to 4341 gm). Eight of the nine pregnancies resulted in live infants (fetal survival rate, 89%); six patients (66%) were delivered at or near term. Preterm delivery occurred at 28 and 35 weeks' gestation in two patients and premature rupture of the membranes occurred in another at 25 weeks, 5 days after cerclage. There was no maternal postoperative or postpartum morbidity. A multifactorial approach to the patient with advanced cervical changes and protruding membranes in the second trimester resulted in a high rate of fetal survival and prolongation of pregnancy until term in the majority of patients. The Shirodkar cerclage holds a distensible cervix closed while the adjunctive medical therapy restores homeostasis.\r"

In all vaginally delivered groups there was significantly decreased maternal morbidity, maternal hospital stay, and estimated blood loss. In the midpelvic deliveries, there was a significant increase in the frequency of neonatal resuscitation and an increase in base deficit for the umbilical artery. In both the midforceps and low-forceps groups, there was a significant increase of neonates with cord arterial pH less than 7.10, and an increase of base deficit, even when cases of fetal distress were eliminated. The midforceps group also had an increased rate of admission to the intensive care nursery and an increase in the risk of significant birth trauma. In considering a midforceps or midvacuum operative delivery, the potential associated risks to the neonate must be balanced against the benefits to the mother.\r"

Increasing numbers of physicians have stopped delivering babies and most obstetricians have decreased their high-risk obstetrics. Most of the attention in the specialty has been directed toward the liability problem in obstetrics as opposed to gynecology. The liability problem in gynecology is not insignificant, however, and has increased in importance in the last several years. This is particularly true in the areas of failure to diagnose and complications of surgery. This study reports on the closed cases involving hysterectomy from Norcal Mutual Insurance Company, a physician-owned mutual company founded in Northern California in 1975. A number of factors are analyzed in comparing those cases involving payment of money because of a settlement or loss at trial with those cases in which no money was paid.\r"

One hundred twelve patients were seen for external cephalic version. Forty-seven patients (48.9%) were successfully converted from breech. The cesarean section rate of successful versus unsuccessful version was 17.2% and 77.5%, respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique. The overall impact is small.

There were six patients curetted during assessment for metastatic trophoblastic disease. Twenty-eight patients underwent curettage for the presumed diagnosis of nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease. In retrospect, four of these women (14.3%) had insufficient criteria for the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease. Of the remaining 23 patients, four (17.4%) went into clinical remission without further treatment. Ten patients (43.5%) had a transitory decline in serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels that subsequently rose or plateaued. Six patients (26.1%) showed no effect from the curettage on their serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin trend during a short period of observation. Three patients (13.0%) with nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease were not observed for a possible therapeutic effect after curettage. Thus, in only 4/20 (20%) women with nonmetastatic trophoblastic disease was a therapeutic effect from curettage shown.\r"

Although infertility was not the primary indication in any case, 32 patients were nulligravid. Only 10 patients were parous and 14 had a history of spontaneous abortion or pregnancy wastage. The average age of the patients was 35.8 years (range, 27 to 47 years). There were no major complications and no patients received blood transfusions. Follow-up revealed three patients with recurrent tumors necessitating repeat procedures. Successful pregnancies have occurred in 40% of those attempting pregnancy.

Fetomaternal transfusion occurred significantly more frequently in the study group (30.6% vs 8.2%, p less than 0.05). Study subjects whose placentas were anteriorly placed were at increased risk for fetomaternal transfusion on comparison with other placental positions (47% vs 23.5%, p less than 0.05). Immediate adverse outcomes including abruptio placentae occurred frequently in the study group (9.4%) and were not predictable on the basis of injury severity. When immediate adverse outcomes were excluded, there was no difference in pregnancy outcome. Four hours of cardiotocographic monitoring used as a screening tool was found to be an extremely sensitive but nonspecific indicator of immediate adverse outcomes. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that routine screening for fetomaternal transfusion occur in all pregnant women who suffer trauma during pregnancy beyond 11 weeks' gestation and that a minimum of 4 hours of cardiotocographic monitoring occur in women greater than 20 weeks' gestation.\r"

  ".W": "Menopause constitutes a sizable proportion of the adult women's life, and it is reasonable to consider that most women will benefit from hormone-replacement therapy. Also, it is important to realize that cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and death in the menopausal patient. Two regimens of hormone-replacement therapy were evaluated in postmenopausal women with 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen with either 2.5 or 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate taken continuously for 52 weeks in 92 patients. The data demonstrated an improvement in menopausal symptoms, a beneficial effect in lipoprotein profiles, the establishment of an atrophic endometrium, and a marked decrease in vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks and a further decrease after 26 weeks. Ideally this regimen will offer better patient compliance and, if the favorable lipoprotein profiles offer protection to the cardiovascular system, the overall health of the American woman will be markedly affected.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated levels of serum and follicular fluid prolactin occur in women undergoing ovulation induction with both clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin therapy. Prolactin's effect on oocyte fertilization and embryo cleavage has not been fully characterized. Using a murine model, we investigated the effect of prolactin on in vitro fertilization and subsequent embryo cleavage in media containing 150, 400, and 600 ng/ml purified mouse prolactin. No difference was found in fertilization rates when compared with control rates. Culture of both in vivo and in vitro fertilized two-cell embryos in murine prolactin at 150, 400, and 600 ng/ml showed no significant difference in blastocyst, morula, or embryo degeneration rates when compared with control rates. An assay for binding of murine prolactin to spermatozoa, oocytes, and the embryo at various cleavage stages revealed no specific murine prolactin binding. These in vitro experimental results fail to show a role for murine prolactin in effecting mature oocyte fertilization or subsequent embryo cleavage. The lack of binding of murine prolactin to the gametes and early developing embryo supports the in vitro findings.\r"

However, the prevalence of substance abuse in patients first seen with symptoms of preterm labor and who deny use of illicit drugs is unknown. Between July 1, 1988, and December 15, 1988, 141 patients first seen at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in suspected preterm labor and a comparison group of 108 uncomplicated laboring term patients had urine toxicology screening performed to detect substance abuse. Positive urine toxicology screenings were found in 24 of 141 (17.0%) patients with suspected preterm labor and in 3 of 108 (2.8%) patients in the comparison group. The most common substance identified was cocaine (14/24 and 1/3, respectively). Of those patients in suspected preterm labor, 22 of 86 (25.6%) clinic patients had positive urine toxicology screenings as did 2 of 55 (3.6%) private patients. On the basis of our observations, we recommend that patients admitted in possible preterm labor be encouraged to submit to screening for substance abuse so that appropriate counseling and prenatal and neonatal care become available for these high-risk patients.\r"

In an effort to increase the rate of intact survival, we have successfully performed transabdominal first-trimester selective termination procedures on 22 pregnancies including one octuplet, five quintuplet, twelve quadruplet, and four triplet gestations. There have been eight sets of twins, and two singletons delivered, seven twin pregnancies are ongoing, and one early and four late losses of pregnancies. With experience we now counsel as to a high likelihood of a technically successful procedure, but we still have concerns for late losses. We have tried to balance the arguments about the direct harms of performing selective termination and the obstetric risks of not performing selective termination. We believe that selective termination should not be considered a \"social\" procedure. Our data do not yet make clear whether one, two, or three is the optimal number of embryos to leave. Therefore, on the basis of both current obstetric risk factors and ethical reasoning we will continue to support our protocol of optimally leaving twins.\r"

Because the simultaneous death of this population of cells results in menstruation, one may say that the life span of this population of cells \"times\" the menstrual cycle. Metamorphosis in amphibians and morphogenesis in several vertebrates are other examples of developmental milestones that are \"timed\" by the life span of specific cell populations. In all these examples, cell death is associated with a specific histology, apoptosis. Apoptosis characterizes the cell death that produces the progressive disappearance of the trophoblast in the chorion laeve as term is approached. Therefore, the histology of trophoblastic death in the near-term chorion laeve corresponds to that of populations of cells with life spans that \"time\" developmental events. The trophoblastic cell population of the chorion laeve is prematurely destroyed by infiltrating maternal leukocytes in cases of chorioamnionitis.\r"

Deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy was found in 87 of 115 (76%) of these cancers with a mean deoxyribonucleic acid index of 1.6 and S-phase fraction of 14.7%. The S-phase fraction of the 28 (24%) diploid tumors was 7.0%. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy was significantly correlated with survival. S-phase fraction was significantly correlated with ploidy, residual tumor, histology, grade, ascites, time to recurrence, and survival. Diploidy versus aneuploidy were the best discriminating values for deoxyribonucleic acid index and an S-phase fraction of greater or less than 18% for that parameter. Multivariate analysis revealed stage, S-phase fraction, residual tumor, and grade to be independently associated with time to recurrence, and stage, age, S-phase fraction, and largest metastases were factors associated with survival. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy did not significantly improve either model. These results suggest that abnormalities of deoxyribonucleic acid content and the proliferative activity of tumor cell populations are reflective of their biologic activity.\r"

The study population included all 1030 cesarean deliveries performed on singleton pregnancies by 11 obstetricians practicing at two Green Bay hospitals from 1986 through 1988; 1076 control patients with vaginal deliveries were selected for comparison purposes. The 1030 cesarean deliveries represented 14% of the 7335 singleton deliveries that occurred during the study period. Individual physician cesarean rates ranged from 5.6% to 19.7%. Cesarean rates for physician groups ranged from 9.8% to 18%. The variances in cesarean rates among individual and groups of physicians were not attributable to patient obstetric risk factors, socioeconomic status, service status, or duration of the physician's practice. Higher cesarean rates did not result in better neonatal outcome. Individual physician practice style was the only apparent determinant of cesarean rates for the 11 obstetricians. Current cesarean rates can be substantially reduced without sacrificing fetal and newborn safety.\r"

Fifty-seven patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancies less than 3.0 cm in greatest dimension were treated with methotrexate and citrovorum factor. The mean time from resolution of the ectopic pregnancy to return of menses was 26.0 (0 to 157) days. Forty-four patients were available for follow-up (2 to 15 months). Nineteen of 23 patients who had hysterosalpingograms demonstrated patency in the ipsilateral tube. Fourteen patients desired pregnancy; 11 of 14 (78.6%) were successful, with 10 of 11 (90.9%) having an intrauterine pregnancy, whereas one of 14 (9.1%) were extrauterine gestations. The mean time from first attempt to achieving pregnancy was 2.3 (1 to 4) months. We conclude that methotrexate and citrovorum factor treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy is associated with subsequent tubal patency and does not impair return of menses. Most importantly, the pregnancy rates after this form of therapy appear to be better than those achieved by traditional surgical methods, and are comparable to results after laparoscopic salpingostomy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if isoflurane and halothane each attenuated coronary artery constriction evoked by serotonin in pigs. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental methods were used. Isolated coronary arteries with an without endothelium were studied in organ chambers in the presence and absence of 2.5% concentrations of the anesthetics. In intact pigs serotonin was infused directly into the left anterior descending coronary arteries to induce constriction. The vasodilator effects of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 2.0% isoflurane and halothane were determined using quantitative angiography. Contractile responses of isolated coronary arteries were depressed by the two anesthetics. Maximum contractile responses to serotonin were as follows: rings with endothelium 45 +/- 5% untreated versus 29 +/- 5% with isoflurane 2.5% (difference between dose-response curves, P less than 0.01) and without endothelium 67 +/- 5% untreated versus 51 +/- 6% with isoflurane 2.5% (P less than 0.001); with endothelium 52 +/- 7% untreated versus 28 +/- 7% with halothane 2.5% (P less than 0.001) and without endothelium 65 +/- 5% untreated versus 40 +/- 6% with halothane 2.5% (P less than 0.001). In intact pigs isoflurane and halothane dilated constricted coronary arteries with and without endothelium at all anesthetic concentrations tested, including concentrations as low as 0.5%.

Magnesium plays important roles in the basic contractile properties of muscle, and many of its actions are antagonistic to those of calcium. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of magnesium sulphate to prevent the MH episode in susceptible animals and correlate this with its effects on the intracellular free calcium [( Ca2+]i). The experiments were carried out using six control (Yorkshire) and ten MH-susceptible crossbred swine (Poland China X Pietrain). After determination of resting concentrations of [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i, each animal was given either two iv bolus doses of 50 mg/kg or one iv bolus of 100 mg/kg of MgSO4. The resting [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i were determined by means of ion-selective microelectrodes. The resting [Ca2+]i in normal muscle fibers was 0.11 +/- 0.01 microM (mean +/- SEM), whereas in the MH muscles the resting [Ca2+]i was 0.36 +/- 0.01 microM. In neither group was the resting [Ca2+]i modified by MgSO4. This cumulative dose of MgSO4 (100 mg/kg) was not able to prevent the induction of an MH episode by 2% halothane. Although MgSO4 did not directly decrease [Ca2+]i, it did attenuate the increase in [Ca2+]i associated with the syndrome from 7.29 +/- 0.43 microM in untreated animals to 0.84 +/- 0.03 microM in MgSO4 pretreated swine. In addition, the limb rigidity that accompanies this increase in calcium was prevented by MgSO4 pretreatment. Baseline measurements of [Mg2+]i were not different in control and MH-susceptible muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four weeks before hemodynamic studies bile duct ligation was performed in all rats to induce cirrhosis. Hemodynamic measurements were performed using the radioactive microsphere method 1 h after the onset of anesthesia and 30 min after hemorrhage. Anesthetized rat lungs were mechanically ventilated with room air. Before hemorrhage cardiac index was higher in conscious rats and in rats receiving isoflurane than in the other groups (P less than 0.001). Hepatic arterial blood flow was similar in conscious rats and in those receiving isoflurane or halothane and was higher than in those receiving ketamine or enflurane. The lowest splanchnic and portal venous tributary blood flows were observed in rats receiving enflurane. After hemorrhage cardiac index was significantly less than before hemorrhage in all groups, except in rats receiving enflurane. After hemorrhage portal venous tributary blood flow decreased significantly in all groups except in enflurane group. During halothane and enflurane anesthesia hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic arterial fraction of cardiac output decreased (P less than 0.01) and they were maintained in the other groups.

EEG was measured using a four-channel bipolar montage and hemoglobin saturation was measured transcranially using reflectance spectroscopy at 760 nm with an isosbestic reference at 800 nm. Hemoglobin saturation of blood in the quadriceps muscle was also measured. Thirty-two episodes of hypotension due to ventricular fibrillation were studied along with 31 episodes of hypotension related to ventricular tachycardia and rapid ventricular pacing. In a typical fibrillatory event there was a decrease in MABP followed almost immediately by changes in hemoglobin saturation of blood in the brain vasculature. The first changes in EEG were detected an average of 6.5 s (P less than 0.001, paired t test) after the beginning of change of brain vascular hemoglobin. In some cases changes in hemoglobin saturation could be detected without changes in EEG. Desaturation curves from muscle and brain were significantly different, suggesting that the brain probe was measuring hemoglobin change in a rapidly metabolizing volume of tissue that was dissimilar to the skin, muscle, and bone monitored by the probe over the quadriceps muscle. Examination of the 32 episodes of circulatory arrest revealed a marked response that began immediately with recirculation characterized by an increase of the hemoglobin saturation signal from brain vasculature to above baseline as the duration of circulatory arrest exceeded 37 s, this response is termed reperfusion hyperoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Desflurane produced a significant dose-related decrease in cerebral vascular resistance from 1.53 +/- 0.21 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g at 0.5 MAC to 0.50 +/- 0.03 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g at 2.0 MAC desflurane.

At 2.0 MAC desflurane CBF was 52 +/- 2 ml.min-1.100 g-1 but was associated with a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 43 +/- 2 mmHg. When MAP was increased to 73 +/- 3 mmHg with phenylephrine, CBF increased to 87 +/- 3 ml.min-1.100 g-1 at this concentration. At 0.5 MAC desflurane, intracranial pressure (ICP) was 15 +/- 5 mmHg, higher than normal, but did not change significantly with increasing concentrations of desflurane. Increasing concentrations of desflurane initially produced on the EEG the common pattern sequence of increasing depth of anesthesia with decreasing frequency and increasing amplitude progressing to burst suppression and then at 2.0 MAC desflurane to regular attenuation with interruption by periodic polyspiking, a pattern similar to that seen with isoflurane. At both 1.5 and 2.0 MAC the EEG pattern initially observed at that concentration changed to one with faster background activity with time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To further investigate the mechanisms involved, the calcium sensitivity and maximal activated tension of detergent-treated left ventricular fibres of fetuses (30 days), newborn (1-day-old), immature (3-, 8-, and 17-day-old), and adult rabbits were determined by stepwise exposure to increasing Ca2+ concentrations. Responses were measured prior to and after exposure to equianesthetic concentrations of halothane (1%) or isoflurane (1.5%) applied in a random order. In control conditions maximal developed tension was the lowest in fetuses (11.1 +/- 0.6 mN.mm-2), intermediate in newborn and immature rabbits, and highest in adults (25.6 +/- 2.9 mN.mm-2). There were also age-related changes in calcium sensitivity; pCa (= -log10[Ca2+]) for half-activation (pCa50) was significantly less in 1-, 3-, and 8-day-old rabbits (5.444 +/- 0.036, 5.425 +/- 0.017, and 5.385 +/- 0.019, respectively) than in adults (5.517 +/- 0.010), whereas it was not different in fetuses (5.521 +/- 0.017). During anesthetic exposure both calcium sensitivity and maximal developed tension decreased significantly in all age groups of animals, with both anesthetics having a similar effect in animals of identical age. However, calcium sensitivity decreased significantly more in newborn animals (0.192 and 0.196 pCa unit for halothane and isoflurane, respectively) compared with adults (0.122 and 0.137 pCa units, respectively).

  ".W": "Rapid intravenous (iv) infusion of protamine sulfate is associated with hypotension in humans. A possible mechanism for this hypotension is the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, from tissue mast cells lining the blood vessels. To determine whether protamine caused nonimmunologic release of histamine, histamine released from dispersed human skin mast cells exposed to protamine sulfate was measured. Skin from seven adult patients was washed, chopped into small tissue fragments, and incubated with collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNAase. Dispersed mast cells were harvested after 12 h of short-term tissue culture, washed, and challenged with protamine sulfate. Histamine release was measured using an automated histamine analyzer and expressed as a per cent of total released histamine measured minus the spontaneous histamine release. Spontaneous histamine release averaged 6 +/- 1%. Protamine produced dose-related histamine release. At a concentration of 3 X 10(-3) M, protamine sulfate released 14 +/- 2% (P less than 0.05), which significantly differed from spontaneous release. This study demonstrates that protamine sulfate causes nonimmunologic histamine release in dispersed human skin mast cells. However, histamine release occurred only at concentrations much greater than those used in clinical practice. Thus, these data do not support the hypothesis that nonimmunologic histamine release is a likely mechanism for protamine-induced hypotension in vivo.\r"

Similar to most industrial accidents, this one had several contributing causes. It demonstrates the need for thorough review and testing of device modifications, the subtle effects of personnel shortages, the dangers of grounded electrosurgical units, and the ways in which seemingly minor features of a device can contribute indirectly to an injury.

Cold (5-6 degrees C), diluted red blood cells (RBC) (Hct = 30%) were infused through the warmers over a series of flow rates, and the resulting temperatures of the infusate were measured. The flow rates of diluted packed RBC were also measured over a series of infusion pressures. At a flow rate of 225 ml/min, the output temperature of the System 250TM was 33.6 degrees C compared with 24.6 degrees C (P less than 0.05) for the conventional warmer. Above a flow rate of 250 ml/min, however, the water bath of the System 250TM cooled significantly, resulting in a deterioration of performance and an output temperature of only 24.2 degrees C at a flow rate of 400 ml/min. With a 16-G catheter attached, the flow rate at a pressure of 300 mmHg was 223 ml/min through the System 250TM compared with 160 ml/min (P less than 0.05) for the conventional warmer. The System 250TM produced higher output temperatures and a lower resistance to flow compared with the conventional warmer, but flow rates of cold blood through the System 250TM should be restricted to 250 ml/min or less to ensure adequate warming.\r"

Eight ASA Physical Status 1 patients (30-70 yr of age) scheduled for otorhinolaryngeal surgery entered the study. The effects of propofol (2-2.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) induction, tracheal intubation, and maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane (0.3%, 0.6%, and 1.2% end-tidal concentrations) and/or 70% nitrous oxide were studied with respect to MSA, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and indices of skin blood flow (laser doppler photometry and finger pulse plethysmography). Induction of anesthesia with propofol decreased MSA to 34 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) (P less than 0.05), and subsequent tracheal intubation increased MSA rapidly to 151 +/- 23% (P less than 0.05) of the control level. Isoflurane administration both with and without nitrous oxide led to a decrease of MSA (P less than 0.05). However, during nitrous oxide/isoflurane anesthesia (1.0 MAC) MSA was 76 +/- 38% higher than when isoflurane was used alone, although this implied a decrease in anesthetic depth to 0.5 MAC. This indicates that nitrous oxide and isoflurane have opposite effects on sympathetic outflow. During undisturbed propofol, nitrous oxide, and/or isoflurane administration (up to 1.0 MAC), MSA retained its normal pulse synchronous pattern, indicating that modulation of sympathetic outflow from arterial baroreceptors was still present. Skin blood flow increased sevenfold to tenfold in association with propofol induction (P less than 0.05) and was maintained at an 11- to 19-fold increase during nitrous oxide and/or isoflurane anesthesia, without any difference between the two anesthetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma samples were obtained for 120 min; concentrations of atracurium were determined using a liquid chromatographic assay. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, adapted to account for elimination of atracurium from both central and peripheral compartments, was fit to the plasma concentration data; an effect-compartment model was fit to the twitch tension data. Volume of distribution at steady state (210 +/- 118, 129 +/- 44, and 100 +/- 22 ml/kg for infants, children, and adults, respectively) and total clearance (7.9 +/- 2.0, 6.8 +/- 1.6, and 5.3 +/- 0.9 ml.kg-1.min-1 for the three groups) decreased with increasing age. Neither elimination half-life (20.0 +/- 5.1, 17.2 +/- 5.1, and 15.7 +/- 2.5 min for the three groups) nor the steady state plasma concentration that resulted in 50% neuromuscular blockade (363 +/- 118, 444 +/- 121, and 436 +/- 122 ng/ml for the three groups) varied with age. The authors conclude that these results are consistent with and explain the previously reported findings that recovery from the neuromuscular effects of atracurium is minimally affected by age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pressure in either the radial (n = 88) or proximal brachial artery (n = 82) was compared with aortic pressure before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafts. Radial artery pressures were measured via 20-G 5-cm long catheters, brachial artery pressures via 20-G 12.7-cm catheters, and aortic pressures were measured via a luer port in the aortic perfusion cannula. Transducers were connected via 122-cm long tubing. For the various systems, mean natural frequencies were 16.1 to 17.7 Hz and damping coefficients were 0.16 to 0.27. Before CPB the brachial systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures were 108.2 +/- 5.2%, 100.9 +/- 2.8%, and 99.6 +/- 2.3% of aortic; respective radial pressures were 113.9 +/- 9.6%, 99.5 +/- 2.8%, and 98.4 +/- 2.8% of aortic. Immediately after CPB the brachial pressures were 99.5 +/- 7.5%, 98.9 +/- 3.5%, and 97.4 +/- 2.9% of aortic, whereas respective radial pressures were 92.1 +/- 14.6%, 94.7 +/- 5.6%, and 90.8 +/- 7.4%. All brachial and radial as a per cent of aortic pressure medians were significantly different, and except for prebypass diastolic and mean, the variance for brachial pressures was significantly less than that for pressures in the radial artery. The prebypass brachial correlation (r) with aortic for systolic, diastolic, and mean were 0.90, 0.98, and 0.98; respective radial correlations with aortic were 0.78, 0.97, and 0.95. Postbypass brachial systolic, diastolic, and mean correlations were 0.91, 0.97, and 0.98; radial were 0.50, 0.93, and 0.83. Brachial artery pressures were more accurate and reliable than radial artery pressures.\r"

The laryngeal responses were monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff positioned within the larynx, and the respiratory responses were monitored by measuring ventilatory flow and tracheal airway pressure. Increases in laryngeal cuff pressure in response to tracheal irritation were 19.7 +/- 4.5 cmH2O (mean +/- SD) at 1.0 MAC, 13.9 +/- 3.6 cmH2O at 1.4 MAC, and 7.6 +/- 1.8 cmH2O at 1.8 MAC, respectively (P less than 0.01 for anesthetic dose). At 1.0 MAC of enflurane anesthesia, tracheal instillation of saline caused immediate laryngeal constriction and all components of the tracheal response, such as apnea, expiration reflex, cough reflex, and spasmodic panting. At 1.4 and 1.8 MAC, the same stimulation caused only apnea and constriction of the larynx in the majority of patients. These results indicate that changes in depth of anesthesia can modify the laryngeal and respiratory responses to tracheal irritation. The close association of laryngeal and respiratory responses may be an integral part of the defensive reflex synergism.\r"

All night polysomnographic recordings were obtained while each patient slept in a private surgical ward room through two nights before and five or six nights after operation. Anesthesia included thiopental, N2O, isoflurane, and fentanyl. Postoperative analgesia was provided with parenteral morphine. Other aspects of care were routine. Nocturnal sleep was markedly disturbed after both surgical procedures. Throughout the operative night and subsequent one or two nights, sleep was highly fragmented with the usual recurring cycles of sleep stages completely disrupted. Slow wave sleep was suppressed and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep virtually eliminated. During the following 2-4 nights, as other aspects of sleep recovered, REM sleep reappeared and then increased to greater than the preoperative amount. This increased REM sleep was marked by a heavy density of eye movement activity along with frequent patient reports of unusually distressing dreams or vivid nightmares. It is concluded that anesthesia with upper abdominal surgery leads to a severe disruption of nocturnal sleep followed by the release of highly intense REM sleep about the middle of the first postoperative week.\r"

When hypocalcemia (Ca++ less than 0.8 mM) occurred during the anhepatic stage, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with chemically equivalent doses of either calcium chloride (10 mg/kg, n = 8) or calcium gluconate (30 mg/kg, n = 7). Serum concentrations of ionized calcium and citrate, hematocrit, arterial blood gas tensions, acid-base state, and hemodynamic profiles were determined before and up to 10 min after calcium therapy. In both groups of patients initial similar and rapid increases in Ca++ (0.98 +/- 0.14 mM in the calcium chloride group and 1.05 +/- 0.10 mM in the calcium gluconate group) were followed by gradual decreases over the next 10 min. Measured hemodynamic values were similar in the two groups, and neither group showed improvement in cardiovascular function after calcium therapy, possibly because of the decrease in preload that occurred during the anhepatic stage. Equally rapid increases in Ca++ after administration of calcium chloride and gluconate in the anhepatic state suggest that calcium gluconate does not require hepatic metabolism for the release of Ca++ and is as effective as calcium chloride in treating ionic hypocalcemia in the absence of hepatic function.\r"

The present study evaluated the accuracy of these same parameters in a CCIP prospectively in two groups of clinically dissimilar patients: 29 healthy female day surgery patients and 11 relatively older and less healthy male inpatients. In addition, another set of pharmacokinetic parameters, previously determined by Scott et al. in the CCIP in 11 male inpatients was also evaluated. The bias and inaccuracy were assessed by the median performance error (MDPE) and the median absolute performance error (MDAPE) in which the performance error was determined as the difference between measured and target serum concentration as a fraction of the target serum concentration. Unlike Maitre et al., the current study found a consistent bias in both populations. The MDPE was +53% and the MDAPE was 53%, with no difference between patient groups. In the 11 patients studied using the Scott et al. pharmacokinetic parameters, the MDPE was +1% and the MDAPE was 17%. The parameters of Scott et al. were further tested by simulating the serum concentrations that would have been achieved had they been used in the CCIP in the first 40 patients; results indicated MDPE of +2% and an MDAPE of 18%. Therefore, reasonably reliable and accurate target serum concentrations of alfentanil can be achieved using the pharmacokinetic parameters of Scott et al. in a CCIP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Volatile anesthetics were demonstrated to decrease calcium sensitivity and maximal developed force of detergent-treated rat cardiac skinned fibers. To further investigate the possible mechanisms involved in the decrease of force production, stiffness measurements were performed at defined levels of activation with the use of quick length changes of 0.3 to 4% of initial muscle length in the absence and in the presence of 2 MAC of halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane. The results of various series of experiments suggest that these anesthetics have multiple sites of action on cardiac myofibrillar proteins: 1) they decreased active stiffness indicating a decreased number of attached force-generating cross-bridges; 2) they increased the stiffness/force ratio suggesting that the individual force developed by each cross-bridge was decreased during anesthetic exposure; and 3) they increased the time constant of force recovery, which is consistent with the decreased rate of ATP hydrolysis described by others. These changes in cross-bridges kinetics and efficiency may result from conformational changes in all the protein systems involved in force production, and especially actin-myosin attachment and detachment. However, the changes observed were small despite a relatively high concentration of anesthetics; therefore, they will probably participate only to a moderate extent in the overall negative inotropic effect of these agents.\r"

  ".W": "Following 4 h of general anesthesia with halothane [1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)]-nitrous oxide (50% in oxygen), whole body protein synthesis is decreased and the rate of leucine oxidation is increased in dogs. To evaluate the effects of general anesthesia with isoflurane on whole body fuel metabolism and the effects of duration of anesthesia on these processes, eight dogs were studied, once in the conscious state (over 9 h) and again prior to and during isoflurane anesthesia (1.5 MAC) for 3.5 h (n = 8). Three additional dogs were studied in the conscious state and over 5 h of anesthesia. Changes in protein, fatty acid, and glucose metabolism were estimated using isotope dilution techniques, employing simultaneous infusions of L-[1-14C]leucine, [6-3H]glucose and [9,10-3H]palmitate. Ten minutes after the beginning of the administration of isoflurane, total leucine carbon flux, leucine oxidation, and leucine incorporation into proteins decreased (P less than 0.05), resulting in a slight decrease in the ratio of leucine oxidation to nonoxidative leucine disappearance (LOX/NOLD, P less than 0.05), an indicator of leucine catabolism. Throughout the 5 h of anesthesia, whole body protein synthesis remained decreased (P less than 0.01), whereas leucine flux and oxidation increased progressively throughout the remainder of the study, resulting in a more than 80% increase in the ratio of LOX/NOLD. After 10 min of isoflurane anesthesia, both plasma free fatty acid concentrations and palmitate turnover had decreased by more than 70% (P less than 0.001) and remained suppressed (P less than 0.001) throughout the remainder of the anesthesia, consistent with decreased lipolysis. Glucose production was increased 10 min (P less than 0.05) following induction of anesthesia and peripheral glucose utilization was decreased following 3.5 h of isoflurane anesthesia (P less than 0.05). These data strongly suggest a widespread and immediate metabolic effect of isoflurane anesthesia, which includes peripheral insulin resistance to glucose disposal, decreased lipolysis, and a progressive increase in protein wasting with increasing duration of anesthesia.\r"

Each rat received either enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane, along with 0%, 15%, or 75% N2O. Anesthetic equilibration was verified by mass spectrometry sampling of end-tidal gases. MAC was determined at each N2O concentration by the standard tail clamp method. The N2O dose-response data for each animal were fit by a second-order polynomial equation to estimate the value of a second-order coefficient. A linear dose-response would result in a value of zero, whereas the extent to which the data deviate from nonlinearity would be reflected by an increase in the value of this coefficient. The null hypothesis, that the second-order coefficient should be zero, was tested by a one-sample two-tailed t test. The volatile anesthetic requirement decreased as the N2O concentration increased; however, it did not do so linearly. For each of the three volatile anesthetic groups, the second-order coefficients were consistently greater than zero (P less than 0.05). These data are not consistent with the accepted presumption that the summation of N2O with volatile anesthetics is linear.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, with a 6-month treatment period and a 6-month follow-up. SETTING: Kaiser Foundation hospitals in Redwood City, Santa Clara, Hayward, and San Jose, California. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 173 patients, 70 years of age or younger, who were smoking before hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. Eighty-six patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and 87 to usual care; 130 patients (75%) completed the study and were available for follow-up. INTERVENTION: Nurse-managed and focused on preventing relapse to smoking, the intervention was initiated in the hospital and maintained thereafter primarily through telephone contact. Patients were given an 18-page manual that emphasized how to identify and cope with high-risk situations for smoking relapse. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One year after myocardial infarction, the smoking cessation rate, verified biochemically, was 71% in the intervention group compared with 45% in the usual care group, a 26% difference (95% CI, 9.5% to 42.6%). Assuming that all surviving patients lost to follow-up were smoking, the 12-month smoking cessation rate was 61% in the intervention group compared with 32% in the usual care group, a 29% difference (95% CI, 14.5% to 43.5%). Patients who either resumed smoking within 3 weeks after infarction or expressed little intention of stopping in the hospital were unlikely to have stopped by 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: A nurse-managed smoking cessation intervention largely conducted by telephone, initiated in the hospital, and focused on relapse prevention can significantly reduce smoking rates at 12 months in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.\r"

In all but one case, patients met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) case definition for the syndrome: peripheral blood eosinophilia (eosinophil count greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/L) and generalized, disabling myalgias without other recognized causes. Three patients with eosinophilia and myalgia developed eosinophilic fasciitis, and 4 other patients developed, respectively, pneumonitis and myocarditis, neuropathy culminating in respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and fibrosis about the common bile duct. No relation was apparent between dose or duration of L-tryptophan exposure and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. No organic contaminants were identified in L-tryptophan preparations taken by patients or asymptomatic users when these preparations were examined by chromatography or mass spectroscopy. Biopsy specimens in 12 patients showed a mononuclear exudate with a variable admixture of eosinophils in affected tissues, including skin, fascia, muscle, and some viscera. Eosinophil toxic granule proteins, major basic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin were elevated in the serum and urine of patients compared with normal control subjects (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.02, respectively). Immunofluorescence showed major basic protein deposited outside of eosinophils in affected tissues, indicating that toxic granule proteins are released in diseased organs. Treatment included withdrawal of L-tryptophan in all cases. Corticosteroids were prescribed for 16 patients and diuretics alone for 1 patient; no drugs were prescribed for 3 patients. Four patients have recovered fully, others are stable or slowly recovering, and 1 is gravely ill despite prolonged treatment.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort study with an average observation period of 5.7 years. SETTING: A prescription-based cohort in the Uppsala health care region in Sweden.

Comparisons were made with women in the background population. MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up through 1983 was done with regard to hospital admissions for a first cervical or trochanteric hip fracture. The observed number of cases was compared with that expected on the basis of person-years of observation in the cohort and incidence rates in the background population. Analyses were made in exposure categories, based solely on prescription data. MAIN RESULTS: During 133 022 person-years of observation, 163 cases of first hip fracture occurred, compared with the 205.5 expected, yielding an overall relative risk of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.93). The greatest protective effect (relative risk, 0.37; CI, 0.13 to 0.79) was found against trochanteric fracture among women receiving potent estrogens who were under 60 years of age at cohort entry. This group also had the highest proportion of treatments with combinations of estrogens and progestogen (41%). Treatment with less potent estrogens, mainly estriols, had no protective effect. Data indicated that the baseline risk for hip fracture was not lower in the cohort women than in the background population. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with potent estrogens, both alone and possibly when combined with progestogens, reduces the risk for both cervical and trochanteric hip fractures within the first decade after menopause.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrastructural studies of biopsied cortical tissue from the right frontal lobe of 8 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed that the number of synapses in lamina III of Brodmann's area 9 was significantly decreased when compared with the number in age-matched control brains (n = 9; postmortem time, less than 13 hours). Further decline in synaptic number was seen in age-matched autopsied AD specimens. In the AD brains there was significant enlargement of the mean apposition length, which correlated with degree of synapse loss; as synapse density declined, synapse size increased. The enlargement of synapses, coupled with the decrease in synaptic number, allowed the total synaptic contact area per unit volume to remain stable in the patients who underwent biopsy. In autopsied subjects who had AD, there was no further enlargement of mean synaptic contact area. There was a significant correlation between synapse counts and scores on the Mini-Mental State examination in the patients who underwent biopsy. Lower mental status scores were associated with greater loss of synapses. Choline acetyltransferase activity was significantly decreased in the biopsied group and declined further in the autopsied specimens of AD. There was no relationship between choline acetyltransferase activity and scores on the Mini-Mental State examination or synapse number. There is evidence of neural plasticity in the AD neuropil; synaptic contact size increased in patients who had biopsy and possibly compensated for the numerical loss of synapses. But by end stage of the disease, the ability of the cortex to compensate was exceeded and both synapse number and synaptic contact area declined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Expression of the mutant enzyme protein in the COS I cell system indicated that it is catalytically inactive and also is unstable. The patient is a compound heterozygote, and the exact abnormality in the other allele could not be identified except that it is not any of the other nine known mutations of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha. The data collectively suggest that the other allele is not producing stable messenger RNA (mRNA). The rapidly increasing number of mutations responsible for clinical and enzymological phenotypes and the very large number of statistically possible combinations among them for compound heterozygosity pose a serious pragmatic problem for classification and nomenclature of this group of rare genetic disorders.\r"

Other cells, including Schwann cells of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, were not affected. The extent of glycogen storage was similar in all patients and unrelated to age or duration of disease. The extralysosomal nature and selectivity of glycogen deposits, sparing fibroblasts and other cells, differ clearly from the findings in skin from patients with glycogenosis II. The purpose of this study was to show that glycogen deposits in glycogenosis III are not restricted to skeletal muscle and liver, and to assess the usefulness of skin biopsy in this disorder.\r"

Previous clinical-anatomical correlations for this syndrome are limited by inconsistencies in clinical diagnostic criteria and low-resolution imaging methods. In our patients, and in a review of the literature, the overwhelming majority of patients with the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome had pontine infarcts. We conclude that if rigid clinical criteria are used, the label of the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome predicts a lesion in the contralateral basis pontis.\r"

Steady-state L-dopa concentrations in cisternal CSF correlated well with plasma levels, and yielded a CSF:plasma ratio of 0.17. The disappearance of L-dopa from plasma and cisternal CSF compartments fits an open, two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Although slower, the distribution and elimination half-lives for L-dopa from cisternal CSF (8.9 and 49.2 minutes, respectively) were of a similar magnitude to those from plasma (4.9 and 33.2 minutes, respectively). If cisternal CSF reflects brain extracellular fluid, then plasma pharmacokinetics of L-dopa are a reasonable approximation of those in the brain. In contrast to cisternal CSF, the disappearance of L-dopa from lumbar CSF fits an open, one-compartment model with an elimination half-life of 100 minutes. This indicates that the lumbar CSF compartment is unsuitable for investigation of the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa in the brain.\r"

In order to determine the mechanism of muscle wasting in this condition, we measured fractional mixed skeletal muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive state in 8 patients with myotonic dystrophy, and compared the results with those of 10 normal subjects. Fractional muscle protein synthesis was determined by measuring the increment of 13C leucine in mixed skeletal muscle protein obtained by needle biopsy from the quadriceps muscle during a primed-continuous infusion of L-(1-13C) leucine. We used plasma 13C alpha-ketoisocaproate (representing intracellular leucine labeling) as the precursor pool for the calculation of fractional muscle protein synthesis and leucine kinetics. Fractional muscle protein synthesis was depressed in the patients with myotonic dystrophy (28% decrease, p less than 0.02). Leucine flux, leucine oxidation, and the nonoxidative portion of leucine flux were not different between the patients with myotonic dystrophy and the normal control subjects. Muscle atrophy in myotonic dystrophy reflects a selective decrease in muscle protein synthesis without any similar decrease in nonmuscle protein synthesis. This decrease may result from an impaired end-organ response to anabolic hormones or substrates.\r"

  ".W": "A comparative topographical immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the basal ganglia (including the substantia nigra) in Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia complex, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The striatal projection neurons and their efferent fibers were examined by using antibodies to calcineurin, methionine-enkephalin, and substance P. Tyrosine hydroxylase served as a marker for nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The basal ganglia of patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex reacted strongly with all of the antibodies and the reaction products exhibited a normal distribution pattern. These findings suggest that the striatal output system is well preserved in patients with this disease. Similar results were obtained in patients with AD or PD. However, as compared to the patients with AD or PD, patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex showed severe reduction (greater than 90%) in the number of dopaminergic neurons in both the lateral and the medial portions of the substantia nigra. In view of the functional cortico-subcortical loops, these findings could explain the parkinsonian features and in part the cognitive impairment that occur in parkinsonism-dementia complex on Guam.\r"

During sitting and standing, gaze was equally as stable as that in normal subjects. During walking in place, however, gaze velocity was double that of normal subjects. Thus, our patients' complaints of impaired vision and oscillopsia during walking could be ascribed to excessive motion of images on their retinas. Eye movements compensated for head rotations more effectively (higher gain) during active head rotations than during locomotion; this difference may be due to the predictable nature of active head movements. We conclude that testing of patients with vestibular symptoms should include stimuli corresponding to the rotational head perturbations that occur during locomotion; such head rotations have nonpredictable characteristics and a frequency range of 0.5 to 5.0 Hz.\r"

No difference was observed in the response to the core protein of rubella virus on comparing the MS and normal control groups. This divergence in the relative antibody response to the viral surface proteins suggests that the vigorous antibody response to rubella virus reported in MS is not simply an expression of a nonspecific polyvalent B-cell response.\r"

After discontinuing levodopa therapy for 12 hours, the motor status of each patient was assessed before a single dose of 100 mg of levodopa plus 25 mg of decarboxylase inhibitor was given and at five 45-minute intervals thereafter. Multiple regression analysis showed that the response duration was best predicted by the severity of PD. The response magnitude was significantly correlated both to the duration of PD and to the duration of levodopa therapy. It is argued, however, that the response magnitude was predicted by the duration of levodopa therapy. Our results are in accordance with those of other recent studies and indicate that variances in levodopa response duration and in levodopa response magnitude are caused by their own differential risk factor.\r"

Using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method and a highly sensitive quantitative Western blot analysis, the anti-Hu antibody was not detected in the 50 normal human sera. Seven of the 44 patients with small cell lung cancer but no paraneoplastic syndrome had detectable levels (average titer, 76 U/ml) of anti-Hu antibody on Western blot. These levels are significantly lower than the average titer of the 25 patients who had small cell lung cancer and paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy or encephalomyelitis (average titer, 4,592 U/ml). In the group with nonparaneoplastic small cell lung cancer (low anti-Hu titer) there was a predominance of women (5 women: 2 men), and all patients had \"limited\" disease when diagnosed. In the antibody-negative group the sex ratio was 16 women to 21 men and 51% of the patients had \"extensive\" disease. None of the 7 patients with a low-titer anti-Hu antibody developed a paraneoplastic syndrome by the time of writing. The anti-Hu antibody appears, when present, to be a good marker for small cell lung cancer and, when present at high titer, for small cell lung cancer associated with a paraneoplastic syndrome.\r"

Most are associated with extracellular deposition of a variant prealbumin (also known as transthyretin). Recent molecular studies demonstrated eight distinct amyloid-associated point mutations in the prealbumin gene on the long arm of chromosome 18 that are associated with hereditary amyloidosis. These findings provide for means of diagnosis using recombinant DNA methods. In a family with the Maryland/German type of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, the proband and 2 of 5 at-risk offspring were diagnosed using the polymerase chain reaction. Allele-specific enzymatic amplification of genomic DNA demonstrated the histidine-58 variant prealbumin gene. This study confirms the point mutation of the prealbumin gene as a cause for this type of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. Preclinical diagnosis illustrates the potential for development of treatment strategies prior to disease onset.\r"

Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons were found in Ammon's horn of 6 of the 8 patients with Ammon's horn sclerosis, and in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of all 8 patients with the same pathology. None of these neurons were found in Ammon's horn of the 7 patients with a ganglioglioma, but were found in the subiculum of 5 of the 7 patients and in entorhinal cortex of all 7 patients. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was also studied in 13 control autopsy specimens. No tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons were found in Ammon's horn or the subiculum of any of the control specimens, but were found in the entorhinal cortex of 6 of the 13 specimens. The tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the mesial portion of the temporal lobe of patients with complex partial seizures may contribute to the increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase found in neurochemical studies of specimens taken at temporal lobectomy.\r"

  ".U": "90297571\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study we investigated the relative vulnerability of neuronal subsets in the striatum to ischemia that was induced by bilateral transient ligation of the common carotid arteries in gerbils. After 4 days of survival, brains were evaluated using histochemical methods (NADPH-diaphorase and silver degeneration procedures) and neurochemical methods with radioimmunoassays for somatostatin-, neuropeptide Y-, and substance P-like immunoreactivity and measurements of amino acids using high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons were strikingly preserved in the ischemic dorsolateral portion of the striatum, in which there was severe neuronal loss. There was no significant depletion of NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the striatum or cerebral cortex. Concentrations of neuropeptide Y-like and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity were unchanged despite a significant 25% depletion of substance P-like immunoreactivity and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Ischemic brain damage may be mediated by a neurotoxic effect of glutamate acting at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Previous studies of NMDA excitotoxin lesions in rat striatum have shown a sparing of neurons containing NADPH-diaphorase, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y. The similar sparing of these neurons following ischemic lesions in gerbil striatum provides further evidence that NMDA receptor activation may play a role in ischemic injury.\r"

Abnormal phosphorylation potentials in skeletal muscle have been demonstrated by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies (heritable disorders of oxidative phosphorylation), but abnormalities of phosphorylation potentials in other organs have not been documented. Several lines of evidence suggest that these mutations may affect mitochondria in nonmuscle tissue. In this study we found that phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios in brain were significantly reduced and that calculated brain ADP concentrations, phosphorylation potentials, and percentage of maximal rate of ATP synthesis were significantly altered in the 5 patients examined. This study indicates a primary abnormality of mitochondrial function in the brain, even in the absence of clinically evident cerebral dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We measured the intrinsic mechanical properties and protein content of single skinned muscle fibers obtained from patients who had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. To check for possible nonspecific changes caused by muscle disease per se, we also studied the properties of muscle fibers obtained from patients exhibiting severe muscle weakness due to polymyositis. Relative to control fibers obtained from 4 patients with normal or nonmyopathic muscle, we found no significant changes in the ability of muscle fibers from the patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or polymyositis to generate active tension in response to calcium or resting tension in response to stretch. In addition, we found no significant changes in the concentrations of the major contractile proteins myosin and actin, of the elastic protein titin, or of the structural proteins nebulin and alpha-actinin. In contrast, immunocytochemical studies showed that dystrophin was absent in the biopsy specimens from the patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but localized at the cell membrane in all of the other muscle biopsy specimens used in this study. These results indicate that myofibrils assemble and function normally in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Therefore, the absence of dystrophin, which is the primary biochemical defect in this disease, leads to clinical weakness by causing the breakdown of muscle fibers that were once capable of generating normal force, while the surviving fibers exhibit normal contractility.\r"

In the CSF of patients with NINDs, the paucity of CD4+CD45R+ and CD8+CD11b+ cells was striking, whereas the same subsets accounted for substantial proportions in the blood. CD4+CD45R- and CD4+Leu8- cells as well as CD8+CD11b- cells increased in the CSF when compared with those in the blood. Seven patients with active multiple sclerosis (MS) and 10 patients with other inflammatory diseases in the CNS (CNS-infl) were also studied. Patients with active MS were characterized by a consistent increase in percentage of CD4+CD45R- cells in the CSF, whereas an increase of CD4- CD45R+ cells in the CSF was a feature of the patients with CNS-infl, when compared with patients with NINDs. These findings indicate that the CNS is routinely surveyed by particular subsets of lymphocytes different from those in the blood, and cellular immune reaction in the CNS varies according to the types of CNS inflammatory conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacological basis of the short-duration response to dopaminergic stimulation in parkinsonism is not completely understood. Whereas it is generally assumed that the response reflects concurrent dopamine receptor occupancy, it is also possible that receptor activation triggers events that outlast the time that receptors are occupied by agonist. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we administered apomorphine, a mixed D1-D2 agonist with rapid equilibration between plasma and brain, to patients with parkinsonism. The clinical response to apomorphine injections lagged behind peak plasma concentrations and persisted beyond the time plasma concentrations following ineffective doses. We conclude that dopaminergic stimulation triggers effects that outlast the period of receptor occupancy by agonist. Understanding these steps may offer new pharmacological therapies for parkinsonism.\r"

In the present study, inoculation of macaques with D/1/California, an immunosuppressive serotype 1 type D retrovirus, was associated with acute and chronic increases in CSF and serum quinolinic acid concentrations in macaques that had developed SAIDS, a simian disease analogous to AIDS in humans--particularly macaques with demonstrable opportunistic infections. Kynurenic acid, an antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors as well as the excitotoxic effects of quinolinic acid, was also increased in the CSF of SAIDS macaques, but to a significantly lesser degree than was quinolinic acid (kynurenic acid, 1.8-fold; quinolinic acid, 15.6-fold). CSF quinolinic acid, but not kynurenic acid, was also increased in viremic macaques with SAIDS-related complex (2.4-fold) and asymptomatic virus positive carriers (3.4-fold). Macaques that had recovered from D/1/California infection and were antibody positive and virus negative had normal CSF quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid concentrations. Increased activity of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, the first enzyme of the kynurenine pathway, was indicated in the macaques with SAIDS by reduced serum L-tryptophan and elevated serum L-kynurenine concentrations. Macaques infected with D/1/California may provide a primate model for investigation of the mechanisms involved in increases in CSF quinolinic acid in retrovirus and other infectious diseases, including HIV-1. It remains to be determined whether the increased CSF quinolinic acid concentrations and the increased ratio of quinolinic acid to kynurenic acid have neurological significance or are a useful \"marker\" of infection.\r"

  ".W": "A 54-year-old man with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease was treated with and autograft of adrenal medulla into the right caudate nucleus and died 4 months after surgery. Postmortem examination revealed that the graft was necrotic. It consisted mainly of reticulin and collagen fibrosis without catecholaminergic cell bodies identified either by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization with labeled human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cDNA probe. Sparse TH-immunoreactive fibers, which did not stain for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), ran through the graft. In contrast, intense staining for these catecholaminergic markers was found in the untransplanted adrenal medulla. Densely packed TH-positive, DHB-negative fibers were found in a restricted zone of the host striatum at the periphery of the graft. This effect was selective since the density of other neurons was not modified. The present study describes an additional patient in whom adrenal medulla autotransplantation failed to improve the parkinsonian disability. It suggests, however, that adrenal medulla grafts may stimulate the sprouting of striatal dopaminergic fibers in a limited zone of the grafted striatum.\r"

Successful efficacies of oral and intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatments with brovavir were demonstrated in both intracerebral and i.p. infections with the HSV-1 WT-51 strain of moderate virulence. However, only weak or modest effects of brovavir were observed against the two model infections with a highly virulent strain, HSV-1 VR-3. Brovavir was not effective in reducing mortality of mice infected i.p. with HSV-1 KOS, which exhibited the highest virulence in mice among HSV-1 strains used when inoculated i.p. However, the drug had a significant effect on intracerebral infection with the KOS strain. Efficacies of oral treatment with brovavir were almost equal to those of i.p. administration in the model infections. After intracerebral inoculation, the VR-3 strain grew in brains of mice at a higher rate than the WT-51 strain. By oral treatment with 50 mg of brovavir per kg twice daily, replication of the WT-51 strain in the brains was markedly suppressed and was eliminated after transient elevation of the titer. Growth of the VR-3 strain in the brains was simply delayed by the drug treatment. Thus, the antiviral efficacy of brovavir in mice was affected by the degree of virulence of the challenge virus strain used for infection.\r"

Significant differences between the study and control groups were found for aminoglycoside volume of distribution (0.40 +/- 0.1 versus 0.27 +/- 0.05 liter/kg [mean +/- standard deviation], respectively; P less than 0.0001), clearance (116.6 +/- 48.9 versus 68.6 +/- 26.7 ml/min, respectively; P less than 0.0001), half-life (2.27 +/- 0.66 versus 3.5 +/- 1.8 h, respectively; P less than 0.0001), and elimination rate constant (0.33 +/- 0.11 versus 0.24 +/- 0.09 h-1, respectively; P less than 0.001). The percentage of bone marrow blast cells (at the time of diagnosis) in patients with acute leukemia significantly correlated with increased aminoglycoside clearance (R2 = 36.98%; P = 0.0001).

These included the restriction of virus replication to the respiratory tract and blood, the replication of virus in ciliated mucosa, and development of viremia for several days during the acute phase of the infection. Infected mice were treated with the antiviral agent (S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine. A marked effect was observed on virus replication in the respiratory tract when chemotherapy was commenced 1 day before virus inoculation; it also cleared the viremia and reversed the progression of clinical signs. When chemotherapy was commenced 1 day after virus inoculation, a moderate, though less marked effect was observed. The efficacy of this drug in the murine infection correlated with activity of the drug against equine herpesvirus 1 in cell cultures. The prospects for chemotherapy in the natural host are discussed in the light of these findings.\r"

  ".W": "It was recently demonstrated that a bis(benzyl)polyamine analog (MDL 27695; N,N'-bis(3-[(phenylmethyl)amino]propyl)-1,7-diaminoheptane) possessed potent antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo (A. J. Bitonti, J. A. Dumont, T. L. Bush, M. L. Edwards, D. M. Stemerick, P. P. McCann, and A. Sjoerdsma, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:651-655, 1989). We now report that MDL 27695 also has potent antileishmanial activity, eliminating 77 to 100% of Leishmania donovani amastigotes from mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro at 1 microM. Administration of 15 mg of MDL 27695 per kg three times per day for 5 days to L. donovani-infected mice suppressed parasite burdens in liver, spleen, and bone marrow by 83 to 96, 90, and 87%, respectively, and by 99.9% in livers of mice given the same dose two times per day for 10 days. Liver parasites were suppressed 74% in L. donovani-infected hamsters treated three times per day for 4 days with 5 mg of MDL 27695 per kg. The 50% effective doses for MDL 27695 were 2.5 mg/kg in mice and about 1 mg/kg in hamsters. In hamsters, MDL 27695 was equally effective against both antimony-susceptible and antimony-resistant L. donovani, suggesting a different mechanism of action for the two types of drugs. Coadministration of N1,N4-bis(butadienyl)-butanediamine (MDL 72527) to mice to inhibit host polyamine oxidase, and hence the formation of oxidative metabolites of MDL 27695, did not affect the antileishmanial activity of MDL 27695.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Optimal therapy of infections caused by borderline oxacillin-susceptible, beta-lactamase-hyperproducing Staphylococcus aureus has not been established. We used a rat model of aortic valve endocarditis to examine efficacies of antibiotic regimens against a borderline oxacillin-susceptible strain as compared with a fully susceptible S. aureus strain. Animals were treated with oxacillin alone or in combination with sulbactam or with ampicillin-sulbactam combinations at two dose levels. Infections caused by the borderline susceptible and fully susceptible strains responded equally well to oxacillin alone, with residual bacterial titers in vegetations falling to 4.8 +/- 1.6 and 4.4 +/- 1.7 (mean +/- standard deviation) log10 CFU/g, respectively. Addition of sulbactam to oxacillin (1:2) did not enhance the efficacy of oxacillin against either strain in the animal model. A high-dose regimen of ampicillin-sulbactam (2:1) yielding mean (+/- standard deviation) levels in serum of 16.8 +/- 7.4 and 9.5 +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, proved equally effective against both strains (bacterial titers, 6.6 log10 CFU/g). However, at lower doses (8.3 +/- 2.6 and 5.9 +/- 2.4 micrograms/ml, the combination showed greater efficacy against the fully susceptible strain, with residual titers of 7.1 +/- 2.0 versus 9.0 +/- 1.6 log10 CFU/g (P less than 0.05). In vitro studies revealed that the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam was also a potent inducer of staphylococcal beta-lactamase at clinically relevant concentrations. Based on this short-term in vivo therapy study, oxacillin would be predicted to be clinically effective in the therapy of infections caused by borderline oxacillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus, while the combination of ampicillin with sulbactam appears to be inferior to oxacillin alone against such infections.\r"

Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.\r"

Mean (standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters for amifloxacin were as follows: maximum observed concentration in plasma, 1.13 (0.48) and 1.95 (0.52) micrograms/ml; half-life, 5.37 (0.96) and 4.47 (0.87) h; total plasma clearance (unadjusted for fraction absorbed), 259 (53) and 199 (55) ml/h per kg; renal clearance, 113 (20) and 86 (26) ml/h per kg; Varea/F (Varea is volume of distribution; F is fraction absorbed), 2.05 (0.75) and 1.28 (0.39) liter/kg; and amifloxacin excreted in the urine, 42.5% (14.5%) and 42.8% (10.6%) for males and females, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between sexes that could not be attributed to differences in body weight. Except for a modest 23% reduction in renal clearance and the suggestion of reduced bioavailability, mean values of pharmacokinetic parameters for elderly male subjects were similar to those previously determined for younger male volunteers. Therefore, a modification in amifloxacin dosage regimen based solely on age may not be necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex bacteria still remains a challenge since these organisms are resistant to a majority of antituberculous drugs. M. avium is very often linked with acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated opportunistic infections. We earlier suggested that one of the strategies for circumventing multiple-drug resistance might be the enhancement of M. avium drug susceptibility by inhibiting the synthesis of the outermost layer of its envelope, which appears to act as an exclusionary barrier for drugs. In this investigation, we have examined this strategy by simultaneously using drugs and the following inhibitors of the M. avium cell envelope: m-fluoro-phenylalanine (an inhibitor of mycoside-C biosynthesis), DL-norleucine (an inhibitor of transmethylation reactions), ethambutol (an inhibitor of arabinogalactan synthesis), EDTA (a divalent-ion chelator), and colistin (an inducer of membrane flux of divalent cations). All the drugs were used in concentrations which were low enough for a possible medical application to be foreseen. This approach, tested on seven strains of the M. avium complex, showed that both m-fluoro-phenylalanine and ethambutol were interesting candidates because they caused significant enhancement of M. avium drug susceptibility.\r"

Resident peritoneal macrophages were infected with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii and exposed to doxycycline at different concentrations. The antitoxoplasmic activity of doxycycline was first assessed with [3H]uracil, which is incorporated by the parasite but not the host cell. The concentration of doxycycline that inhibited 50% of the radioactive uptake was calculated to be 6.4 micrograms/ml (95% confidence limits, 5.07 to 8.06 micrograms/ml); the concentration of doxycycline that inhibited 90% of the radioactive uptake was 14 micrograms/ml. Tetracycline was ineffective up to 40 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, microscopic examination of the infected macrophages after treatment with doxycycline confirmed the inhibition of intracellular growth of T. gondii. Mice acutely infected by the intraperitoneal route with 5 x 10(3) tachyzoites of T. gondii were protected against death with a dose of 300 mg of doxycycline per kg (body weight) administered by the oral route for 10 days, starting 24 h after challenge. When mice were infected with 10(5) tachyzoites of T. gondii and treated 12 days starting 2 h after challenge, the protection and the cure rates were, respectively, 100 and 0% after doxycycline alone (300 mg/kg per day), 0 and 0% after pyrimethamine alone (12.5 mg/kg per day), and 100 and 60% after the combination of these two drugs at the same dosages given above. These results suggest that doxycycline may prove to be useful in the treatment of toxoplasmic infections.\r"

Multiple serum samples were drawn following a 1-h vancomycin infusion at steady state over an 8- to 12-h dosing interval. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by noncompartmental analysis. There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to age, weight, serum creatinine, volume of distribution, or protein binding. Burn patients had a significantly higher creatinine clearance than did IVDA or controls. Vancomycin clearances averaged 142.8, 98.0, and 67.7 ml/min in burn patients, IVDA, and controls, respectively. The renal clearance of vancomycin was also higher in burn patients than in the other groups. IVDA tended to have a higher vancomycin clearance (31% higher) than did controls, but the difference was not statistically significant. Vancomycin clearance was much higher in burn patients requiring dosage individualization and close monitoring. A considerable amount of vancomycin was eliminated through renal tubular secretion, making dosage predictions based on creatinine clearance more difficult. Further work with IVDA will be needed to determine if they represent a group requiring aggressive vancomycin dosages.\r"

The subjects were given 200 mg of theophylline (Theo-Dur) orally every 12 h for 4 days. On day 5, the subjects began receiving 400 mg of enoxacin with each theophylline dose, and the dosage of theophylline was reduced to 100 mg b.i.d. This regimen was continued through day 8, after which enoxacin was discontinued. The theophylline dosage was increased to 200 mg b.i.d. on day 9, and theophylline monotherapy continued through day 12. The mean apparent theophylline clearance decreased by approximately 50% during enoxacin coadministration. No significant differences in mean theophylline maximum concentration in serum, time to maximum concentration in serum, lowest concentration observed, or area under the concentration-time curve during the steady-state dosing were observed before, during, or after enoxacin coadministration when the theophylline dosage was reduced to 100 mg b.i.d. Reduction of the theophylline dose by 50% at the onset of enoxacin dosing maintained constant theophylline concentrations in plasma. A return to the original theophylline dose immediately upon cessation of enoxacin therapy resulted in a transient 35% increase in theophylline concentrations in plasma which lasted 24 to 48 h before returning to preenoxacin values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis was used to assay the concentrations of both drugs in serum and urine. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. The total body (CL), renal (CLR), and nonrenal (CLNR) clearances; steady-state volume of distribution (Vss); and fractional urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin were all markedly decreased with the simultaneous administration of azlocillin. The disposition of azlocillin was unchanged when it was given with ciprofloxacin compared to when it was given alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- standard deviation) of ciprofloxacin given alone versus in combination with azlocillin were as follows: CL, 52.2 +/- 9.2 versus 33.9 +/- 6.0 liters/h (P less than 0.0005); CLR, 26.5 +/- 4.8 versus 16.2 +/- 4.2 liters/h (P less than 0.0005); CLNR, 25.8 +/- 5.5 versus 17.7 +/- 4.0 liters/h (P less than 0.03); Vss, 224 +/- 30 versus 166 +/- 41 liters (P less than 0.01); fractional urinary excretion, 0.56 +/- 0.06 versus 0.43 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.002), respectively. This interaction resulted in significantly higher and more prolonged concentrations of ciprofloxacin in serum, which may be beneficial in the treatment of serious gram-negative bacterial infections, but it could also produce greater toxicity or result in more pronounced effects on oxidative drug metabolism of other medications.\r"

Because of the potential role of this cytokine-leukocyte interaction in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, we investigated the ability of pentoxifylline to modulate meningeal inflammation in the rabbit meningitis model. Pentoxifylline treatment (initially an intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg per h) started 20 min before intracisternal injection of 20 ng of Haemophilus influenzae type b lipooligosaccharide (endotoxin) reduced significantly concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of leukocytes (P less than 0.0001), protein (P less than 0.001), and lactate (P less than 0.001) during the 9-h infusion compared with values in intravenous-saline-treated rabbits. When pentoxifylline was given 1 h after H. influenzae type b endotoxin, the mean peak lactate and leukocyte concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly lower than those in control animals. Pentoxifylline also significantly decreased lactate and protein concentrations (P less than 0.05) and tended to diminish leukocyte counts (P = 0.08) compared with results in control animals after antibiotic-induced release of endotoxin in animals with H. influenzae meningitis. In this regard, dexamethasone was superior to pentoxifylline and no synergism was observed when the drugs were combined. Additionally, pentoxifylline attenuated meningeal inflammatory changes induced by intracisternal inoculation of 10 ng of rabbit recombinant IL-1 beta compared with results in either dexamethasone- or saline-treated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recently we found that certain antibiotics which are markedly concentrated by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) failed to kill susceptible, intraphagocytic Staphylococcus aureus, even though cellular drug levels were quite high. The possibility that specific antibiotics might adversely affect phagocyte antibacterial function was considered. Thus, we studied the effects of multiple antibiotics and adenosine, a known modulator of the PMN respiratory burst response, on neutrophil antibacterial function. At nontoxic concentrations, these drugs had no effect on degranulation in stimulated PMN. Adenosine was a potent inhibitor of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMPL)-stimulated superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation in PMN but produced less inhibition of microbial particle-induced respiratory burst activity. Three of the tested antibiotics, all of which reach high concentrations in phagocytic cells, had a marked modulatory effect on the PMN respiratory burst. Clindamycin, which enters phagocytes by the cell membrane adenosine (nucleoside) transport system, had only a modest effect on FMLP-mediated superoxide production but inhibited the microbial particle-induced response by approximately 50%. Roxithromycin and trimethoprim were efficient inhibitors of PMN superoxide generation stimulated by FMLP and concanavalin A (also inhibited by erythromycin) but had less effect on zymosan-mediated respiratory burst activity. Antibiotics which entered phagocytes less readily had no effect on the respiratory burst response in PMN. These results, as well as those of experiments with inhibitors of cell membrane nucleoside receptors, indicated that the antibiotic effect is mediated through intraphagocytic pathways. The possibility that antibiotic-associated inhibition of the PMN respiratory burst response might alter leukocyte antimicrobial and inflammatory function deserves further evaluation.\r"

Pharmacokinetic properties of PFA in young (growing) and adult specific-pathogen-free cats were compared. Mean PFA clearance from plasma was twofold higher in young cats (7.52 ml/min per kg of body weight) than in adult cats (3.70 ml/min per kg). Higher PFA clearance from plasma observed in young cats may result from higher renal clearance or enhanced accumulation of PFA in bone tissue of young versus adult cats. No plasma protein binding of PFA was observed. Mean oral bioavailability was 35% in young cats. These data indicate that age-related differences in PFA clearance from plasma occur in cats.\r"

  ".W": "A dual-enzyme immunoconjugate system was evaluated for its cytotoxic effect on Candida tropicalis. Glucose oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide in the presence of glucose and oxygen and myeloperoxidase, which catalyzes the oxidation of halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, were each conjugated to a C. tropicalis-specific monoclonal antibody. Neither the glucose oxidase nor the myeloperoxidase conjugates exhibited any significant cytotoxic effect by themselves. A combination of glucose oxidase conjugate (3.2 ng/ml) and myeloperoxidase conjugate (12.8 ng/ml) in the presence of 5 mg of glucose per ml, 150 mM chloride, and 50 microM iodide was cytotoxic to C. tropicalis, killing 99.9% of the treated sample. Flow cytometry was used to characterize the binding of the conjugates to yeast cells and demonstrated that the binding of both conjugates to the yeast cell surface is required for cytotoxicity. In addition, the concentrations of conjugates required for a cytotoxic effect were below the concentrations required to saturate all of the yeast cell surface antibody-binding sites.\r"

Saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to conscious rats by continuous intravenous perfusion (1 mg/kg per day for 7 days) from a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Twenty-four hours after surgery (day zero), treatment with saline or GM (15 mg/kg; intraperitoneally, twice a day) was started for 5 days. Levels of LPS in plasma measured by Limulus amoebocyte lysate activity decreased significantly from days 1 through 8. At days 5 and 8, the cortical concentrations of GM were higher in the LPS-perfused and GM-treated group (LPS plus GM) than they were in the saline-perfused and GM-treated group (saline plus GM) (P less than 0.05). Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine remained at normal levels throughout the experiment. A significant increase of cortical tubular cell regeneration was observed in the LPS plus GM animals as compared with regeneration observed in the other groups (saline plus saline, LPS plus saline, and saline plus GM), as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Moreover, histopathological nephrotoxicity scores showed a synergistic toxic effect between LPS and GM. These results demonstrate that chronic perfusion of low doses of LPS potentiates the nephrotoxicity of GM.\r"

A dose response protective effect was observed with SCH 39304 at 5 to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, with 5 mg of SCH 39304 per kg per day providing activity similar to that of 100 mg of fluconazole per kg per day. Colony counts of yeasts in the lungs of mice sacrificed while on therapy with SCH 39304 were consistently below those of controls, and several lungs were sterile.

The ability of these patients' cells to respond in a proliferation assay to various mitogens was similar to that of controls, with the exception of patients in the terminal phase of their illness. Patients with active disease who were unable to generate LAK activity were capable of responding in a proliferation assay to interleukin 2.

  ".W": "During the 17-year period 1972 through 1988, a total of seven cases of agranulocytosis associated with the use of dapsone for the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis were reported in Sweden. The median age of the patients involved was 61 years; three of them were male. The median duration of dapsone treatment was 7 weeks and the daily prescribed dose was 100 mg. Based on sales and prescription data, the crude relative risk of agranulocytosis during dapsone treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis was 50, and the total risk was one case per 3000 patient years of exposure to dapsone. In relation to the number of new cases of dermatitis herpetiformis, agranulocytosis was estimated to develop in 1 of 240 to 425 patients receiving dapsone therapy. Patients should be instructed to seek medical care immediately in case of fever.\r"

Histologically, both tumors exhibited superficial elongated strands of eccrine ductal epithelium containing occasional lumina lined by an eosinophilic cuticle. The stroma was loose, myxoid, and fibrovascular. The secretory portions of the eccrine glands were ectatic in the first patient but were not seen in the second patient. We believe these lesions represent acrosyringeal hamartomas (nevi), although some authors interpret them as adenomas. The literature seems to indicate that lesions with similar histologic features may be solitary, multiple, or combined with other neoplasms; in other cases, the lesions may possibly represent an unusual morphologic expression of hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.\r"

The patients with negative symptoms did not have a significantly larger ventricular-brain ratio than did those with mixed or positive symptoms, however. As an alternative approach, patients were also classified by ventricle size (large and small); this classification had less predictive validity, with the use of hypothesized indexes of structural brain abnormality, than did the classification based on phenomenology.\r"

Among a group of 160 high-risk subjects, those who escaped delivery complications, who evidenced a high degree of autonomic responsiveness in adolescence, and who experienced severe disruption of the early family rearing environment were significantly more likely than those without this pattern to evidence outcomes of schizophrenia with predominantly positive symptoms (40% vs 1.2%, respectively). In late childhood and early adolescence, predominantly negative-symptom schizophrenics were rated by their teachers as passive, socially isolated, and unresponsive to praise; predominantly positive-symptom schizophrenics were rated as overactive, irritable, distractible, and aggressive. The study is limited by the fact that the hypotheses were based in part on previous analyses of the same data set, by the small number of schizophrenic subjects of each subtype, and by the use of simplified theoretical and statistical models that do not address the multidetermination of negative and positive symptoms.\r"

The morbid risk for all schizophrenia-related disorders, and specifically for schizophrenia-related personality disorders, was significantly greater among the relatives of the probands with schizotypal and/or paranoid personality disorder than among the relatives of probands with other personality disorder.

The CSF homovanillic acid levels, however, were negatively correlated with ratings of psychosis and positive symptoms, and the CSF homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels correlated negatively with individual deficit symptoms. Stepwise and hierarchical multiple-regression analysis revealed that among monoaminergic measures, only the CSF and plasma homovanillic acid levels contributed significantly to the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and positive symptom variance with negative and positive partial correlations, respectively. Levels of CSF 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, but not of CSF norepinephrine, were significantly elevated in the schizophrenic patients compared with controls, and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels were positively correlated with negative symptoms.

  ".W": "In a prospective study, specimens of resected small and large intestine from fifteen patients with Crohn's disease were prepared by heparin-saline vascular perfusion, followed by either resin casting of the mesenteric vascular supply and tissue maceration or glutaraldehyde perfusion-fixation, resin casting, and tissue clearance. The specimens were examined by macrophotography, histopathology, and either scanning or transmission electronmicroscopy. A pathogenetic sequence of events in Crohn's disease was seen--vascular injury, focal arteritis, fibrin deposition, arterial occlusion mainly at the level of the muscularis propria, followed by tissue infarction or neovascularisation. These features were confined to segments of intestine affected by Crohn's disease and did not occur in normal bowel. The findings suggest that Crohn's disease is mediated by multifocal gastrointestinal infarction. This pathogenetic process is compatible with many of the clinical features of Crohn's disease, and its recognition has important implications for the identification of the primary cause of the illness and advances in clinical management.\r"

  ".W": "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' \"Guidelines for vaginal delivery after a previous cesarean birth\" include a precautionary statement regarding estimated fetal weight of more than 4000 g. To evaluate the validity of this restriction, we conducted an analysis of the outcomes of 301 trials of labor with birth weights equal to or greater than 4000 g. In the birth-weight range of 4000-4499 g, 139 of 240 patients (58%) delivered vaginally. In the group with birth weights exceeding 4500 g, 26 of 61 patients (43%) delivered vaginally. When compared with 1475 trials of labor with birth weights under 4000 g, no significant differences in perinatal or maternal morbidity were found. Comparison with a control group of 301 women with no previous uterine surgery who delivered macrosomic infants also demonstrated no significant differences in perinatal or maternal morbidity. The medical literature does not support elective cesarean section for suspected fetal macrosomia in nondiabetic women, and based on our experience, there appears to be no reason for treating previous-cesarean mothers differently.\r"

Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive condition of zinc deficiency characterised by chronic diarrhoea associated with failure to thrive, periorificial dermatitis and alopecia, susceptibility to infections and behavioural changes. Diagnosis is usually established by reduced serum zinc levels (classical acrodermatitis enteropathica). Paneth cell abnormalities on electron microscope of a small bowel biopsy can be supportive. A few cases with the typical picture of acrodermatitis enteropathica without hypozincaemia (variant acrodermatitis enteropathica) have been described. The diagnosis of variant acrodermatitis enteropathica to date has been based on an entirely empiric, but nonetheless convincing clinical response to oral zinc therapy. Laboratory aids to diagnosis have been lacking.\r"

The response rate was 79%. Twenty organizations were able to identify the sex of their members, including the 7 specialty societies that represent the 6 most frequently chosen specialties of women physicians. Only in the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians was the enrollment of potential female members equivalent to that of male members. If the medical specialty societies do not address the issue of women being underrepresented in their societies, they will lose a large potential resource of leadership, participation, and financial support. More important, the societies will not be truly representative of their specialties.\r"

Eight of 13 SEEGs, 10 of 13 AEEGs, and 12 of 13 with the combined use of both SEEGs and AEEGs accurately predicted the occurrence of seizures at 3-4 months corrected age. Results with SEEG and AEEG did not produce significantly different outcomes. Combined analysis of SEEG and AEEG produced significantly different results from those calculated when the two EEG types were analyzed independently (Z = 3.98, p less than 0.001). The findings indicate that the use of both of these tests may improve the ability to predict continued seizure activity in infants with neonatal seizures when compared to the use of each measure separately.\r"

In some cases, deficiencies of fast myosin light chains have been reported. We performed 1-dimensional polyacrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient gel electrophoresis of muscle proteins from 13 patients with congenital nemaline myopathy and 10 controls to examine the alpha-actinin and the distribution of myosin light chains in congenital nemaline myopathy. At 95 kd (corresponding to alpha-actinin), 4 patients and all controls had 1 band, 2 patients did not have any bands, and 7 had bands that were clearly weaker than those of the controls. Because alpha-actinin is present in the nemaline bodies of congenital nemaline myopathy muscle, only the deficiency of this protein must be apparent. No apparent differences in fast myosin light-chain distribution could be documented between patients and controls; no correlation was observed between muscle fiber type and light-chain distribution. The results suggest that alpha-actinin is abnormal in congenital nemaline myopathy.\r"

This finding allows a reliable biochemical diagnosis; however, the test is complex and time-consuming and only available in a few centers. Ultrastructural examination of skin biopsy in 5 patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type C demonstrated lysosomes containing loosely arrayed dark lamellated structures within a clear matrix. Affected cells included macrophages, axons, pericytes, Schwann cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts with relative sparing of vascular endothelium and melanocytes. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of this simple and readily available morphologic test for the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease, type C.\r"

Technically satisfactory recordings were obtained in all patients; recording time consisted of 24, 22, and 6 hours for 15, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. Eighteen patients were not receiving antiepileptic drug therapy at AEEG. The follow-up intervals after the AEEG ranged from 4-20 months. Only 2 patients had epileptiform AEEGs. Of the remaining 19 with nonepileptiform records, 10 were seizure free without antiepileptic drug therapy, but 9 developed additional seizures which required treatment.\r"

Electrodiagnostic studies indicated a presynaptic disorder of the neuromuscular junction which improved with high-frequency stimulation, similar to findings in Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Muscle specimens exhibited neurogenic targetoid fiber atrophy. Ultrastructure of the neuromuscular junction indicated terminal axon degeneration and atrophy with depletion of the secretory vesicles. Most reported patients with post-ventilator paresis have received steroids and muscle relaxants; muscle weakness commonly has been brief and attributed to steroids. We believe that this reversible myasthenic syndrome probably represents neurotoxicity due to high doses of steroidal nondepolarizing blocking agents; however, available data are insufficient to resolve this controversy.\r"

Two of these HMAbs, designated N70-1.5e and N70-2.3a, react with epitopes of gp120 expressed by all strains tested thus far, and therefore, appear to identify conserved epitopes. The other two HMAbs, K24-3b and N70-1.9b, identify variant epitopes; K24-3b binds to an epitope which is absent from two strains but heterogeneously expressed in eight other strains; N70-1.9b binds to an epitope that is found in relatively few strains. We also describe a novel immunoassay in which viral glycoproteins, produced by HIV-1-infected cells grown in serum-free medium, are affinity immobilized in Concanavalin A-coated wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. This method greatly facilitates the preparation of solid-phase HIV envelope glycoproteins from multiple virus strains and screening immunoassays based on this method are highly sensitive and effective in detecting antibodies to gp120.\r"

The epitope is formed from amino acids within the sequence IHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELLELDK; however, antibody 5-21-3 is unable to recognize the epitope-forming sequence when it is presented to the antibody in the form of a short (642-665) synthetic polypeptide. The epitope apparently is partially formed when additional native sequence of varying length is added to the amino and/or carboxy ends of the epitope-forming sequence, and 5-21-3 binds these larger synthetic polypeptides to varying degrees depending on the position and length of the flanking sequences. The 5-21-3 epitope apparently is formed from contiguous amino acids which require a specific, conformation-dependent, secondary structure for proper epitope formation. Binding preferences exhibited by 5-21-3 toward synthetic polypeptides and recombinant proteins may reflect the conformational nature of the epitope in disrupted HIV which elicited formation of the monoclonal.\r"

  ".U": "90298079\r", 
  ".W": "Mononuclear phagocytes can be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although these cells express CD4 antigen, which is the recognized cellular receptor for HIV, additional cell surface proteins such as the Fc receptor, might serve as receptors for infection. In order to study this possibility we used the U937 monocytic cell line as a target for HIV infection. Flow cytometry of U937 showed that 97% of cells expressed CD4, 33% expressed the high affinity 72 kD Fc receptor (FcRI), and 74% expressed the low-affinity 40 kD Fc receptor (FcRII). Virus neutralization tests were performed by preincubating heat-inactivated human anti-HIV sera with HIV-1, IIIB strain, and then challenging U937. After 13 days in culture, productive HIV-1 infection was monitored by reverse transcriptase activity. High concentrations of certain sera (10(-1)-10(-3) dilutions) neutralized HIV-1, but at subneutralizing concentrations (10(-4)-10(-6) dilutions), five of these sera enhanced viral infection approximately two- to threefold. This enhancement of HIV-1 infection was totally blocked by 1 microgram/ml recombinant soluble CD4 (rCD4) or by 0.5 microgram/ml anti-CD4 Leu3a monoclonal antibody. These results suggest that serum enhancement of HIV-1 infection, thought to be due to binding to the monocyte Fc receptor, requires HIV-1 binding to CD4, since rCD4 or Leu3a blocked this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to determine whether HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) coinfection leads to simultaneous replication of both viruses in the same human CD4+ cell (MT-4 cell line) and the possible effects of coinfection on infectious virus production. Results from transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed replication of typical HSV-2 nucleocapsids in the nucleus and budding of HIV-1 particles through the plasma membrane and through intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing enveloped HSV-2 particles in the same coinfected cell. Coinfection of HIV-1 persistently infected H9IIIB or promonocytic U1 cells with HSV-2 did not alter total production of infectious HSV-2 or the percentage of HSV-2 infectious centers compared with control H9 and U937 cells infected with HSV-2 alone. However, in coinfected promonocytic U1 cells HSV-2 induced infectious HIV-1 production measured by syncytial plaque assay. In summary, both HIV-1 and HSV-2 can coinfect and simultaneously replicate in the same human CD4+ cell. Interactions between HIV-1 and HSV-2 appear to be unidirectional, resulting in accelerated replication of HIV-1 as reported by Albrecht et al. (J Virol 1989;63:1861-1868), but not HSV-2 as shown by us.\r"

IOP was measured 3, 6, 9 and 24 hours after surgery, and in the full- and half-strength carbachol groups pupil size and subjective complaints of brow ache were recorded. The mean IOP 3 and 6 hours after surgery was significantly lower in all the treatment groups than in the control groups. At 9 and 24 hours it was significantly lower only in the carbachol groups. The use of sodium hyaluronate was not found to affect the postoperative IOP. There was no difference in postoperative IOP or miosis between the full- and half-strength carbachol groups, but fewer patients in the half-strength group than in the full-strength group reported brow ache at 9 and 24 hours. The results suggest that carbachol is the most effective agent currently available for the management of IOP after cataract extraction.\r"

Simple algorithms were developed to generate from the nasal suprathreshold points of the G1 program two \"qualitative indices\", mean defect-qualitative (MD-Q) and loss variance-qualitative (LV-Q); these are analogous to the indices mean defect and loss variance respectively, which were calculated from the PFN program data. MD-Q and LV-Q were found to be well correlated with their quantitative counterparts. They provide a uniform method for interpreting the nasal suprathreshold points of the G1 program and help identify patients in whom further quantitative testing is likely to yield useful information.\r"
