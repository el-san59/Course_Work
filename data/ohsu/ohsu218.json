Patients with sustained lymphocyte counts less than 900 mm-3 for prolonged periods after treatment showed less rapid progression over the ensuing 3 years than did patients with multiple sclerosis who had lymphocyte counts above this level (p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that a simple laboratory test, the absolute blood lymphocyte count, may serve as a valuable barometer for monitoring the amount of immunosuppressive therapy needed to prevent progression in patients with multiple sclerosis, and possibly other autoimmune diseases.\r"

Patients were monitored for one week of baseline and for five weeks after PB tapering was initiated (withdrawal). Most were observed for at least one week after levels were undetectable. When ranked seizure counts were averaged, there was a tendency for seizure rates to be highest as PB levels passed through the range 15 to 20 mg/l, compared with rates at higher or lower PB levels. There was little or no relation between the rate of PB withdrawal, other drug therapy, or initial PB level and the ratio of highest seizure frequency to mean seizure frequency. Patients withdrawing from PB may be most likely to experience an increase in seizure frequency when their PB blood level falls below 20 mg/l.\r"

  ".W": "A polyclonal antiserum has been produced that can detect nanogram amounts of myelin basic protein (MBP)-like material in unconcentrated human urine. The urinary immunoreactive material is cross-reactive with human MBP peptides 45-89 and 69-89, dialyzable, heat resistant, and is not artifact of either degradation of radioligand or salt effect. An octapeptide, MBP peptide 82-89, was demonstrated to be the smallest peptide containing the main epitope against which this antiserum was directed. This epitope differed from the major epitope recognized by antisera detecting MBP-like material in cerebrospinal fluid, implying that the MBP-like material is altered, presumably degraded, in the kidney. Results of gel filtration and high-performance liquid chromatography suggested a size of 1,000 daltons or less and a charge similar to that of human MBP peptide 80-89. In a group of 39 persons with multiple sclerosis, 48 with other neurological diseases, and 26 normal control subjects, the concentration of urinary MBP-like material, related to the concentration of urinary creatinine, was significantly higher in the multiple sclerosis group (22.0 ng MBP-like material/mg creatinine) than in the other neurological diseases or control groups, in which the values were 7.0 and 3.9 ng MBP-like material/mg creatinine, respectively. Variations in the level of MBP-like material appearing in the urine may provide a clinically feasible test for myelin damage. The precise identification of the chemical nature of the urinary MBP-like material may also furnish a means for further analyzing the in vivo catabolism of the potentially autoantigenic MBP.\r"

Performance time was less when the arm restraint was applied. Generally, tonic and phasic EMG activity decreased in all muscles monitored.

Those with high social independence tended to be married; have assertive, self-assured, and self-sufficient personalities; more education; and more earned income. Both groups of highly independent persons tended to have hired attendants, good health, and more transportation options. They were outgoing, predominantly female, and tended to perceive themselves as independent. Functional abilities were not significantly related to levels of psychologic and social independence.\r"

Endurance activities such as stationary bicycling and swimming, as well as noncontact sports (which provide optimal musculoskeletal conditioning without potentiating a joint or muscle bleed), were also included. Within a contingency contract format, designated points were given for adherence and exchanged for reinforcers. Adherence parameters included the percentage of prescribed therapeutic exercises performed, the percentages of exercise record forms returned, and the percentage of sessions attended. During the treatment phase, therapeutic adherence averaged 94% across the three parameters. Adherence declined during the follow-up phases from 84% to 66% across these parameters, as explicit reinforcement decreased.\r"

The Goldberg Scale of Vocational Development was used to measure changes in vocational development over time. The Barthel Index was used to measure level of functional independence. Results revealed that vocational development was markedly depressed during initial inpatient rehabilitation and for six months after injury. Gradual improvement occurred after six months, but two years after discharge the level of vocational development remained lower than that before injury. Changes in vocational development over time did not differ significantly by level of functional independence. Best predictors of successful vocational outcomes were educational attainment, educational plans made before injury, and origin of interests in work.\r"

Aspects of medications, orthotic/prosthetic evaluation, and energy expenditure are discussed. The subject was a 63-year-old Class IV cardiac patient with combined restrictive-obstructive pulmonary disease of moderate severity. He had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (two-vessel) followed by a bilateral below-knee amputation for an ascending dry gangrene. The initial ambulatory aerobic evaluation showed the patient achieving only 50% of predicted maximal heart rate and 20% of maximal oxygen consumption. An individualized daily training program started the patient walking at .5 mph, 0% elevation, for five repetitions at two minutes each. By the end of the six-month training program the workload reached 1.4 mph at 2.5% elevation, for 30 minutes of total external work. The final exercise test evaluation showed an overall increase in age-predicted maximal heart rate (90%) and oxygen consumption (55%). The patient improved from cardiac Class IV to Class II, and therapeutically from Class E (bed rest) to Class C (moderate exercise restriction). These findings suggest a need for endurance training programs for patients with cardiopulmonary disease hindered by additional physical disabilities. The program enabled the participant to engage in significantly higher levels of activity for daily living within the community.\r"

Three days later sensory and motor function deteriorated and he required mechanical ventilation. Surgical exploration found no cause and a fusion was done. Neurologic function stabilized after three weeks with a C1 sensory level, no neck movement, and slight weakness of the tongue. Patient and family were followed closely by the spinal cord injury rehabilitation team from onset of injury. The patient was transferred to the ventilator-dependent pediatric rehabilitation program after ten weeks. Bowel, bladder, skin, and nutritional management were stabilized and taught to his parents who remained with him constantly. Communication was achieved with a \"talking tracheostomy.\" He learned to use \"Sip-n-Puff\" control for driving an electric wheelchair and for Morse code input to a computer. He was passive but cooperative during hospitalization. Eight months after injury he was discharged to his home, which had been modified to meet his needs. A computer word processor, environmental control unit, and modified van were obtained; nursing care was provided around the clock. The patient enrolled in a community college course. Soon after discharge he contacted an attorney to explore legal actions for ending his life, which he considered intolerable. After obtaining medical and psychiatric reports, a court order was issued, which established his legal competence and directed people taking care of him to follow his directions. A few weeks later, 25 months after his injury, he privately said goodbye to his family, asked to be disconnected from the ventilator, and died. Medical and legal issues raised by this case are discussed.\r"

Animal genetic models have successfully reproduced particular aspects of the syndrome, but have not completely mimicked alcoholism. Requiring complete mimicry of an animal genetic model is unwarranted and tends to distract analysis from the point. Since many rodent models of genetic sensitivity to several effects of ethanol now exist, the focus of our efforts should be concentrated in two areas. First, genetically specified lines may be analyzed in depth to reveal mechanisms of ethanol's actions on tissue which lead ultimately to the development of alcohol dependence. Second, attention should be paid to those traits which may predict alcohol dependence susceptibility, with particular emphasis on those traits which may be directly extrapolated to human populations. Studies with WSP and WSR mice, selected for alcohol withdrawal severity are discussed in this framework.\r"

  ".W": "All three types of subunit of class I human alcohol dehydrogenase have been analyzed both at the protein and cDNA levels, and the structures of alpha, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1, and gamma 2 subunits are known. The same applies to class II pi subunits. Extensive protein data are also available for class III chi subunits. In the class I human isozymes, amino acid exchanges occur at 35 positions in total, with 21-28 replacements between any pair of the alpha/beta/gamma chains. These values, compared with those from species differences between the corresponding human and horse enzymes, suggest that isozyme developments in the class I enzyme resulted from separate gene duplications after the divergence of the human and equine evolutionary lines. All subunits exhibit some unique properties, with slightly closer similarity between the human gamma and horse enzyme subunits and somewhat greater deviations towards the human alpha subunit. Differences are large also in segments close to the active site zinc ligands and other functionally important positions. Species differences are distributed roughly equally between the two types of domain in the subunit, whereas isozyme differences are considerably more common in the catalytic than in the coenzyme-binding domain. These facts illustrate a functional divergence among the isozymes but otherwise similar changes during evolution. Polymorphic forms of beta and gamma subunits are characterized by single replacements at one and two positions, respectively, explaining known deviating properties. Class II and class III subunits are considerably more divergent. Their homology with class I isozymes exhibits only 60-65% positional identity. Hence, they reflect further steps towards the development of new enzymes, with variations well above the horse/human species levels, in contrast to the class I forms. Again, functionally important residues are affected, and patterns resembling those previously established for the divergently related polyol dehydrogenases are encountered. The two isozymes of human aldehyde dehydrogenase also exhibit considerable differences, with only 68% structural identity. The results show an early divergence into isozymes before the man/horse species radiation. Cys-302 is a functionally important residue and is located in one of the regions with conserved hydrophobic properties. Other regions with large differences in hydropathic properties may explain the absence of cross-hybridizing isozyme forms of human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase.\r"

  ".W": "The biological effects of ethanol and other simple organic molecules have traditionally been ascribed to their actions on the lipid portions of biological membranes. However, at the concentrations at which these molecules exert their pharmacological effects in man and other animals, changes in the structure and fluidity of lipid bilayers are extremely small and can be mimicked by a change in temperature of only about 1 degree C. On the other hand, we have found that the activity of a soluble protein can be markedly affected at these concentrations. Indeed, the concentrations of general anaesthetics which half-inhibit the activity of this enzyme are essentially identical to those which cause general anaesthesia in animals. The evidence thus suggests that ethanol and other simple molecules act directly on proteins rather than lipids.\r"

Different size classes of cDNA clones coding for the beta subunit were characterized with 3' non-coding regions of 213, 590 and 1331 nucleotides. In addition, two unused polyadenylation signals were found, indicating that signals other than AATAAA, are required for 3' end formation. Determination of cDNA structures corresponding to the gamma 1 and gamma 2 subunits makes it possible to explain the kinetic differences between the two allelic subunits in terms of two amino acid replacements. In total, 35 of 374 amino acid residues differ between the class I subunits. Only in the beta pleated sheet region of the coenzyme-binding domain is an almost complete lack of substitutions noted, illustrating the importance of this region. The class II, with pi subunits, has also been determined and shows a much lower extent of homology.\r"

The content of ADH-A mRNA in liver correlates well with enzyme activity in the mouse strains; hence, the expression of Adh-1 appears to be under transcriptional control. A restriction fragment polymorphism was found in mouse liver DNA which correlates with the content of ADH-AA in the high and low ADH activity strains.\r"

Kinetic analysis suggests an ordered bibi mechanism for X-ADH. Ethanol can be oxidized by class III isoenzymes at high substrate concentration, but with a very slow rate. Thus, their contribution to physiological ethanol elimination is probably insignificant. The general properties of the class III isoenzymes isolated from different mammals by ourselves and other authors are discussed.\r"

Thus, an amount of acetaldehyde much larger than previously thought by measurements in plasma becomes available to exert extra-splanchnic toxicity.

Ten healthy men swallowed a tablet of calcium carbimide (50 mg) or placebo and about 2 hours later drank 0.25 g/kg ethanol within 5 min. The pulmonary blood concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde were estimated indirectly by analysis of end-expired alveolar air. The onset of facial flushing and associated cardiovascular response coincided with the peak concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood. The speed of absorption of alcohol was faster in subjects treated with CC. A smaller volume of distribution of ethanol was evident after pretreatment with CC; 0.636 L/kg compared with 0.675 L/kg after placebo. The rate of elimination of ethanol from blood was about 5% slower in subjects given the CC tablet. The disposition kinetics of acetaldehyde were markedly different when aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) was inhibited. The maximum blood-levels of acetaldehyde ranged from 40-242 microM compared with 1.7-6.5 microM in the placebo control experiments. The elimination half-life of acetaldehyde after CC treatment ranged from 18-31 min. Our results do not support a significant role of acetaldehyde in regulating in-vivo metabolism of ethanol in humans.\r"

Whether this enzymatic activation of cyanamide is mediated primarily by catalase present in the microsomes or involves the cytochrome P-450 enzymes is not known. We now report that cyanide is also a product of the microsomal oxidation of cyanamide. Formation of cyanide from cyanamide and rat liver microsomes was time dependent, reaching maximal levels within 5-10 min. Induction of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes by phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment doubled the yield of cyanide, while SKF-525A blocked this PB-induced increase. Administration of 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) to PB-treated rats inhibited the catalatic activity of their microsomes by 98% and substantially reduced cyanide formation. These results suggest that while catalase is responsible in major part for the oxidation of cyanamide to cyanide by uninduced microsomes, the participation of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes cannot be ruled out in PB-induced microsomes. We propose a metabolic scheme wherein N-hydroxycyanamide is the intermediate product of cyanamide oxidation, which then decomposes to yield the observed product, cyanide. By deduction, the second product of this decomposition is postulated to be nitroxyl (HNO), which may be the active AlDH inhibitor.\r"

To try to understand why fatty acid-stimulated ethanol uptake occurs much faster than rates of H2O2 generation reported previously, studies were conducted to measure these parameters under identical conditions in the perfused rat liver. New methods were developed to measure H2O2 generation in a recirculating perfusion system based on the fact that methanol is oxidized only by catalase in rat liver. One method for measuring H2O2 generation in the perfused liver was based on the linear decrease in the concentration of methanol per unit time and the stoichiometry between H2O2 production and methanol oxidation of nearly 1:1. A second method relied on quantitation of the time necessary for the steady-state level of catalase-H2O2 measured spectrophotometrically (660-640 nm) through a lobe of the liver to return to basal values following the addition of known quantities of methanol. Basal rates of H2O2 production measured with both new methods and rates of 4-methylpyrazole- insensitive ethanol oxidation were similar (9 to 17 mumol/g/hr). Rates of H2O2 generation were increased up to 80 mumol/g/hr by addition of oleate or palmitate (1 mM), values which compared well with rates of fatty acid-stimulated palmitate (1 mM), values which compared well with rates of fatty acid-stimulated ethanol uptake of 70 to 90 mumol/g/hr measured in the presence of 4-methylpyrazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The principal data supporting a role for catalase is an occasionally reported moderate depression of ethanol metabolism after aminotriazole. In deermice lacking ADH, we observed a slight (though not statistically significant) decrease in basal ethanol metabolism of hepatocytes after aminotriazole. However, this decrease was found to parallel a similar inhibition of MEOS by aminotriazole, and thus may not reflect catalase mediated peroxidation in this animal. 1-butanol, a competitive inhibitor of ethanol oxidation by MEOS and not a substrate for catalase, decreased ethanol metabolism by hepatocytes in a concentration dependent manner. These results, as well as those from other investigators, indicate that MEOS mediates virtually all of non-ADH ethanol metabolism in vivo.\r"

In contrast, both the Se-dependent and the microsomal Se-independent glutathione peroxidase activity and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was much lower in perivenous hepatocytes, suggesting that these cells have a lowered detoxification capacity, which may contribute to their greater susceptibility to damage by xenobiotics. The mechanism of the ethanol-induced GSH depletion in vivo was studied by incubating conventionally isolated hepatocytes. In the absence of glutathione precursors, ethanol (80 mM) did not influence the GSH content, despite accumulation of acetaldehyde (10-100 MicroM). L-Methionine or L-cysteine stimulated GSH replenishment to in vivo rates. Ethanol oxidation resulted in acetaldehyde accumulation, but did not inhibit GSH replenishment from L-methionine and even stimulated that from L-cysteine. This seems to exclude conjugation of GSH with acetaldehyde as a mechanism by which ethanol suppresses GSH levels in vivo.\r"

Ble-GGT was markedly increased (40-75%) by chronic alcohol consumption. The ecto-activity strongly correlated with total GGT activity, measured in whole liver homogenates from ethanol-fed animals (r = 0.898, p less than 0.001). Ble-GGT was found to catalyze the utilization of significant amounts of circulating GSH (7.4-14.7 nmol/min/100 g B.W.). Chronic ethanol treatment led to marked increases (111%) in the hydrolysis of circulating GSH, which highly correlated (r = 0.958, p less than 0.001) with total liver GGT activity. An increased Ble-GGT activity following chronic alcohol consumption might constitute a mechanism to increase the hepatic availability of GSH precursors.\r"

The ethanol-induced increase in fatty acid uptake was found to be an effect of ethanol per se, whereas the decreased oxidation of fatty acids and secretion of VLDL-triacylglycerol was found to be due to ethanol metabolism.\r"

The results indicate that in addition to the reoxidation of NADH, both oxidation of acetaldehyde and dissociation of NADH from alcohol dehydrogenase contribute to the determination of the rate of ethanol elimination. This was found to be true even when ethanol elimination was partly inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole, which shows that significant concentrations of acetaldehyde are present even when the rate of production is low.\r"

The protective action of the anti-oxidants suggests that lipid peroxidation (probably initiated by acetaldehyde) is an important event in the pathogenesis of acute alcoholic fatty liver.\r"

Mean plasma corticosterone and ethanol levels following the acute ethanol challenge were not significantly different in the three tested periods. A significant negative correlation between plasma corticosterone levels in the naive state and subsequent levels of individual voluntary ethanol intake was obtained. No apparent relationship was observed, however, between the same levels of ethanol consumption and the corticosterone response in these animals after ethanol exposure or exposure with abstinence. These data suggest that levels of ethanol intake may be related to the initial response to acute ethanol of the adrenal-pituitary axis. If so, this acute response to ethanol may be used to predict subsequent levels of ethanol intake.\r"

  ".W": "Laboratory rats in a 24 hr free choice paradigm consume ethanol in a series of discrete drinking bouts. However, little research has been directed at establishing whether these individual bouts were pharmacologically relevant to animals. The present study was designed to investigate the pharmacological efficacy of a simulated ethanol drinking bout and the possible role of acetaldehyde (ACH) and its metabolizing enzymes in mediating these effects using various enzyme manipulations. Following an ethanol screening procedure (2% to 10%, free choice) to establish a drinking baseline, animals were deprived of ethanol for a two week period. Using a limited access procedure, animals were then presented with a 10% ethanol solution for a 10 min period each day for 10 days. On Days 11-15, 4 hr prior to ethanol presentation, animals were divided into four groups and received i.p. injections of either saline (S), 4-methylpyrazole (4MP), cyanamide (C) or 4-methylpyrazole + cyanamide (4MP + C). This latter treatment condition has been shown to prevent the accumulation of ACH in the periphery by cyanamide. On Day 12, 10 min after the drinking session, animals were placed in open field chambers and locomotor activity was recorded for 5 min. Results indicated that animals pretreated with cyanamide (groups S + C and 4MP + C) consumed significantly more ethanol across the 5 test days than groups S + S and 4MP + S. Locomotor activity was significantly depressed for animals pretreated with cyanamide alone (C + S), although drinking levels were comparable to all other groups on Day 12. Together, these data demonstrate that a stimulated drinking bout is a pharmacologically meaningful event since it can be altered by manipulating acetaldehyde-metabolizing enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this preference test (3 week periods) it was found that the \"weekend\" treated rats voluntarily selected individually defined doses irrespectively of the concentration of ethanol (5-25 per cent) offered in the preference test.

The amount of ethanol consumed (g/kg body weight) was used as an unobtrusive measure of preferred intake. The reciprocal relationship between mood and consumption was analyzed by LISREL. While euphoria has usually been perceived as a consequence of drinking, the only plausible fit to a LISREL model was obtained by assuming that the disposition to drink would be increased by positive mood changes occurring during the drinking session. An analogy between social drinking and adjunctive behaviour was supported, as alcohol consumption was directly affected by time-dependent environmental factors such as company and music. Since the presence of company also stimulated positive mood and alleviated boredom, consumption was precipitated by company indirectly as well as directly. These results emphasize the importance of direct as well as indirect environmental influences on spontaneous alcohol intake during social drinking.\r"

Findings were compared with those of 60 non-alcoholics. The alcoholic sample was heterogenous with regard to age, sex and social and cultural level as well as with regard to the troubles induced by alcohol intake. However, despite the disparity, great homogeneity was seen in the representation of the biography of alcoholics. Most alcoholics attach great importance to events occurring during the first year of alcohol dependence (which seems to be rich in events, particularly negative ones) and alcoholism is the determinant factor in their weighting of events.\r"

Tolerance to this anticonvulsant effect develops following a series of ethanol injections delivered at 48-hr intervals only when an amygdaloid stimulation is administered during each period of ethanol intoxication. In the present study, the response contingency was shown to also play a critical role in the dissipation of tolerance. There was no significant loss of tolerance over a 14-day retention interval in rats that received: 1) bidaily ethanol injections each followed 1 hr later by a convulsive stimulation; or 2) bidaily ethanol injections but no stimulation; or 3) neither ethanol nor stimulation. In contrast, tolerance dissipated completely in rats that received: 1) bidaily stimulations but no ethanol; or 2) convulsive stimulation 1 hr before each bidaily ethanol injection. Accordingly, the cessation of ethanol exposure was neither necessary nor sufficient for the dissipation of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol. The critical factor in the decline of tolerance was the elicitation of seizures in the absence of ethanol.\r"

A second study found that hyperbaric exposure during acquisition significantly reduced the development of chronic, functional ethanol tolerance measured by sleep-times and wake-up ethanol concentrations. Further investigations suggest that hyperbaric exposure during dependence acquisition also attenuates the development of ethanol dependence. These results support the hypothesis that hyperbaric exposure directly antagonizes molecular actions of ethanol leading to acute intoxication, tolerance and physical dependence.\r"

We measured tolerance to EtOH and erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition after intoxication by continuous inhalation of AcH vapor for a period of 21 days. Pathophysiological and nutritional parameters were compared between treated and pair weight controls. We showed that: intoxication with AcH is technically possible via the pulmonary route, producing plasma AcH levels comparable to those seen after ethanol intoxication. The dose of AcH needs to be increased progressively to maintain constant plasma levels this indicates metabolic tolerance. the AcH-intoxicated animals had a metabolic tolerance to EtOH. AcH intoxication led to alterations in fatty acid composition similar to those seen after EtOH intoxication, especially in the saturated/unsaturated ratio of the phosphatidyl-choline and phosphatidyl-inositol fractions. AcH probably plays a part in the phenomenon of tolerance to EtOH.\r"

It is not manifested in an escapable-shock test or an amphetamine-stress test, but is shown as significantly more activity by the alcohol-insensitive ATs in a low-stress (33 degrees C) modification of the forced-swimming test. The correlation between alcohol sensitivity and swimming-test activity is, however, not significant in unselected Long Evans rats. Differences in coat color have also developed in the AT and ANT lines; it was possible to estimate whether these changes are independent of ethanol sensitivity with computer simulations. They showed, for example, that the probability of the observed loss of the agouti color in the ATs being by chance is about 0.53 and the probability is nearly 0.50 for there being a spurious line difference, i.e., unrelated to ethanol sensitivity, in which only line had lost the agouti allele. More generally, these and other simulations showed that permanently maintaining selected lines is not the optimal method for finding genetically-based factors related to ethanol sensitivity or other characteristics for which lines have been developed. Nor is either revitalization or replicate lines optimal. The best method apparently would be perpetual restarting of lines.\r"

While the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown, we have reported that specific depletion of hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) prevents the prolongation of tolerance by DGAVP. The present study explored possible presynaptic interactions between DGAVP and 5-HT terminals in the hippocampus, in relation to tolerance retention. When administered acutely, DGAVP had no effect on the rates of hippocampal or septal 5-HT synthesis in naive rats, as assessed by the NSD 1015 method. Moreover, chronic DGAVP treatment that maintained tolerance did not change the in vivo rate of 5-HT synthesis in the hippocampus or septum. Similarly, no significant differences were found in the levels of hippocampal 5-HT or 5-HIAA. Septal 5-HIAA levels were slightly but significantly lower in ethanol-DGAVP than in ethanol-saline rats. While the lack of changes in hippocampal 5-HT synthesis argues against a presynaptic DGAVP-5-HT interaction, the possibility remains of a peptide modulation of 5-HT postsynaptic actions.\r"

A uniform alcohol exposure group received alcohol (6.6 g/kg/day) in 12 daily feedings (every 2 hrs) resulting in stable BACs below 100 mg/dl. A condensed alcohol exposure group also received 6.6 g/kg/day but the alcohol was concentrated in 4 of 12 daily feedings giving peak BACs above 400 mg/dl. Condensed alcohol exposure induced a large degree of microencephaly on PD 10 which was still present on PD 90. Uniform exposure caused a mild degree of microencephaly on PD 10 which could not be detected at PD 90. Correlated with these brain changes were changes in behavior during development. Condensed exposure to alcohol increased locomotion during postnatal days 14 to 20. Condensed alcohol exposure caused delays in the development of balancing ability and coordinated hindlimb movements. Thus, the pattern of alcohol exposure appears more critical than the dose in determining the degree of damage inflicted by alcohol to the developing central nervous system.\r"

Invariably, significantly higher blood acetaldehyde levels were measured in ALDH I-deficient subjects after ethanol loading. The initial flushing in Orientals after alcohol ingestion might be due to their inability to metabolize acetaldehyde quickly and effectively in the absence of the low Km ALDH I isozyme. While Oriental populations of Mongoloid origin showed varying degree of isozyme deficiency, none of the Caucasian or Negroid populations have this isozyme abnormality.\r"

Stimulation of NAT activity in vitro by forskolin, which directly stimulates adenylate cyclase, also was significantly less in pineal glands from fetal alcohol exposed rats when compared with pineal NAT activity from rats exposed to the control diets during gestation. The results suggest that the effects of fetal alcohol exposure is not limited to the beta-adrenergic receptor at the cell membrane, but that exposure to alcohol in utero may result in more general effects on intracellular mechanisms involved in pineal NAT enzyme synthesis or activity.\r"

These elevated levels exhibited a significant correlation to the increased amounts of hydroxyproline in liver samples, when the samples were taken during CCl4 treatment. Analysis of the molecular weight distribution of serum antigens by gelfiltration revealed for 7S-collagen a bimodal distribution, whereas NC 1 eluted mainly as one peak. This peak coeluted with the high molecular weight peak of 7S-collagen, suggesting that this peak might represent intact type IV collagen.

By contrast, in non-alcoholics, there was a reduction of Low-Km ALDH related with the severity of liver injury but ADH was similar in patients with chronic hepatitis and non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Furthermore, ADH was significantly lower in alcoholic than in non-alcoholic cirrhotics. These results suggests that the decreased ADH and ALDH in alcoholics are not primary abnormalities predisposing to alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease. The diminution of ADH found only in alcoholics could be due to the loss of the enzyme produced by centrolobulillar cell necrosis, that is often observed in alcoholic liver disease.\r"

The measurement of serum ADH activity appears to be useful for the detection of acute and early centrilobular hepatic damage, as deduced from the results obtained from experimental hepatic injuries produced by bromobenzene, hypoxia and acute administration of ethanol. Whereas serum ADH activity increased slightly after the generation of an acute ethanol load in rats which were given ethanol chronically, the hepatic content of ADH tended to decrease. Moreover, a rather selective reduction of hepatic ADH activity was found in zone 3 of the hepatic acinus. Thus, it is conceivable that chronic alcoholic injury to the liver may result in persistent release of ADH from hepatocytes resulting in a relatively low elevation of the level of the enzyme in the blood, rather than a sudden release of the enzyme leading to a sharp increase in the serum enzyme activity.\r"

The concentrations of unconjugated steroids remained unchanged while the concentrations of estradiol conjugates increased markedly in all subjects in parallel with the alcohol concentration in blood. The results indicate that the reduction of the 17-oxo group of estrogen conjugates is influenced by the altered redox state in the liver during ethanol oxidation. The increased formation of estradiol conjugates combined with their hydrolysis in target organs could be one of the mechanisms behind the feminizing effects of ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a study of the serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3, retinol, retinol-binding protein (RBP) and selenium among 13 alcoholics and 19 control subjects, in relation to alcohol consumption and diet. The intake of ethanol last year was 178 +/- 116 g/d among the alcoholics and 3.7 +/- 4.5 g/d in the control group (p less than 0.002). The concentration of alpha-tocopherol was lower (37%) among the alcoholics, 15.2 +/- 4.4 mumol/l, compared to the controls, 24.2 +/- 4.2 mumol/l (p less than 0.002). Mean serum concentration of selenium was reduced by 25% in the alcoholics (1.2 +/- 0.3 mumol/l) as compared to the controls (1.6 +/- 0.2 mumol/l) (p less than 0.002). Fiftyeight per cent of the heavy alcohol consumers had a concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 below lower limit of reference (20 ng/ml). Serum level of retinol and RBP was similar in the two groups. Intake of vitamin E was reduced by 62% last month among the alcoholics compared to the controls, whereas no difference was found in intake of vitamin D. Of the alcoholics, 85% had increased serum activities of liver enzymes. In conclusion, heavy consumption of ethanol reduced plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol, selenium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The two former of these observations may be of particular interest in view of the protective effect exerted by antioxidants towards cell damage. The latter observation may contribute to the high frequency of bone fractures and osteomalacia in alcoholics through disturbance of calcium and phosphate metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "88106851\r", 
  ".W": "A prevailing view among those studying neuroendocrine effects of ethanol is that acute doses suppress luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) secretion, and consequently inhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) release in the rat. This phenomenon has not been observed in primates, and has been thought to be a species difference. The experimental procedures, however, have involved ethanol administration by oral or intragastric (ig) routes in humans and monkeys, but intraperitoneal (ip) or carotid artery injection in rats. It has also been suggested that inhibition of LH secretion by ethanol in rats is mediated by endogenous opioid peptides (EOP), because the effect can be reversed by the opiate antagonist naloxone. An alternative explanation is that ip ethanol injection might stress rats sufficiently to activate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (H-P-A) and EOP systems that are well known to inhibit hormonal activities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (H-P-G) axis. Presented here are preliminary results from experiments with male rats. When ethanol is administered ig, under relatively stress-free conditions, it does not inhibit LH secretion in gonadally intact or castrated males. In contrast, ip injection of the same ethanol dose (2.0 g/kg body wt) causes pronounced inhibition of LH secretion and concomitant increases in plasma prolactin (PRL) and corticosterone--indicative of a stress response. Furthermore, when ip ethanol administration is preceded by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of a corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) antagonist (alpha-helical ovine CRF residues 9 to 41), the effects of ethanol on LH and corticosterone are blocked. These results indicate that it may be stress, rather than ethanol per se, that inhibits LHRH and LH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conceptualization of the puzzle has heretofore focused on the ethanol component of alcoholic beverages. In addition to ethanol, however, alcoholic beverages contain a myriad of substances which are collectively termed congeners. To examine the possibility that the congeners of alcoholic beverages include substances which are capable of producing an estrogenic effect, the congeners of bourbon were prepared and administered to ovariectomized rats. Exposure to bourbon congeners produced a dose response in both the mass of the uterus plus fallopian tubes and in plasma levels of luteinizing hormone. These findings provide evidence that the congeners of at least one alcoholic beverage are capable of eliciting responses which are consistent with a hypothesis that alcoholic beverages contain estrogenically active substances.\r"

Given that many alcoholic beverages are made from plants which have been shown to possess estrogenic activity, we considered the possibility that alcoholic beverages may contain estrogenically active substances. To evaluate this hypothesis we first extracted and then used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify two phytoestrogens, biochanin A and beta-sitosterol in the bourbon extracts. Based on these findings we suggest that the feminization observed in chronic male alcoholics with liver disease may reflect, at least in part, the presence of biologically active phytoestrogens in the alcoholic beverages they consume.\r"

By using probes of the polar part of the membrane, ANS and TMA-DPH, in addition to DPH, it was shown in the present study that disturbances also exist in the polar region of the membrane which probably are related to changes in surface glycoconjugates. Furthermore, the acute fluidizing effect of ethanol was correlated with the capacity of the membrane to bind ethanol, which in turn appeared to be linked to the glycans. Chronic ethanol abuse thus causes complex disturbances of membrane organization at different levels of the membrane.\r"

Norepinephrine (NE) was used as an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist to stimulate PI hydrolysis in both tissues. Stimulation of PI hydrolysis by maximal concentrations of norepinephrine (e.g., 100 microM) was inhibited approximately 50% by 500 mM in vitro ethanol in slices from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum. NE-stimulated PI hydrolysis was not affected by 500 mM ethanol in brain stem slices. KCl (20 mM)-stimulated PI hydrolysis was strongly inhibited in all of the above brain regions in the presence of 500 mM ethanol. To further characterize the effects of ethanol on PI hydrolysis in brain, an isolated membrane preparation was used. Guanine nucleotide and calcium-dependent PI hydrolysis in cortical membranes was not affected by concentrations of ethanol as high as 500 mM. In liver slices, NE-stimulated PI hydrolysis was inhibited 50% by 30 mM ethanol in vitro. These results suggest that ethanol may interfere with the coupling of the alpha 1 receptor to the phosphoinositide phosphodiesterase in brain and liver.\r"

One half of the group of subjects was then given diphenhydramine, 50 mg (H1 receptor antagonist) and cimetidine, 300 mg (H2 receptor antagonist) and the second half received placebo tablets before the administration of alcohol. The clearest difference between the antihistamine group and placebo group was in the skin flushing reaction. The antihistamine group showed a statistically significant reduction in the skin flush.

They were compared to a similar group of 11 non-flushing Occidental subjects following a larger ethanol dose (0.37 g/kg) to determine if similar effects could be produced in less sensitive individuals. Control tests of blood ethanol and acetaldehyde (AcH) levels (calculated from breath), facial and neck skin temperatures, body sway (Romberg test), blood pressure, heart rate and 10 Subjective High Assessment Scales (SHAS-Judd, 1977) were conducted before and at 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after drinking ethanol as vodka in orange juice. The tests were repeated one week later one hour after receiving 0.64 gm of ASA orally. ASA produced slight changes in the early absorption of ethanol and small decreases in AcH levels in the flushing and non-flushing groups. Facial flushing was markedly reduced in the flushing group, but was slightly increased in the non-flushing Occidentals. Body sway was reduced by ASA in both groups. An alcohol-induced increase in heart rate in the flushing group was reduced with no change in blood pressure. SHAS subjective parameters were widely variable, but indicated that ASA produced reduced sleepiness and earlier relaxation in the flushing group. It is concluded that ASA can block alcohol-induced facial flushing in sensitive subjects and also reduces body sway in the Romberg test and alters some subjective feelings of alcohol intoxication.\r"

Ethanol also significantly inhibited potassium-stimulated [14C]GABA release from cortical synaptosomes. These data suggest that ethanol selectively inhibits GABA release from neurons by a specific effect on potassium conductance, and inhibits ACh release by a selective effect on Na+ conductance.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of research suggest that the depressant effects of intoxicant-anesthetic compounds are mediated through the GABA receptor-chloride ionophore. We have recently demonstrated a procedure that allows direct measurement of GABA-mediated chloride influx in neural tissue. Using this approach in conjunction with receptor-binding techniques, we examined the role of the GABAergic system using mice selected for genetic differences in ethanol hypnosis. A low concentration of ethanol (15 mM) enhanced the muscimol-stimulated chloride influx in cerebellar membranes from Long-sleep (LS-ethanol sensitive) mice, but had no effect on membranes from Short-sleep (SS-ethanol resistant) mice. In addition, muscimol was more potent in stimulating chloride flux and in inhibiting 35S-TBPS binding in LS membranes than in SS membranes. Mice from a heterogeneous stock were selected for differences in ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex. Cerebellar membranes from these mice also showed differences in ethanol augmentation of muscimol-stimulated chloride flux in vitro that were related to their differential sensitivity to ethanol in vivo. This combined genetic-neurochemical approach provides strong evidence for the importance of GABA-operated chloride channels in ethanol intoxication.\r"

Our interest and that of a number of other groups, therefore, has centered on the intact organ and intact animal, using noninvasive indicators of lipid peroxidation such as ethane or pentane release and low-level chemiluminescence. The studies were mainly carried out with the isolated perfused rat liver, and there is substantial evidence for aldehydes being crucial in promoting lipid peroxidation. The range of aldehydes was extended from acetaldehyde to longer-chain aldehydes; in particular, aldehydes which themselves can originate from polyunsaturated fatty acid breakdown, e.g. 4-hydroxynonenal and congeners, were studied and were found to be potent in supporting lipid peroxidation.\r"

Exposure to alcohol in vitro had no significant effects on the content of neuroactive amino acids as well as the activities of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In contrast, AcAl showed remarkable reductions of neuroactive amino acids content, and of CAT and AChE activities, but induced no alteration in the activities of GAD and GABA-T. [3H]Flunitrazepam [( 3H]FLN) binding and the stimulatory effect of GABA on [3H]FLN binding were found to be inhibited by in vitro exposure to both alcohol and AcAl, both of which, however, induced no changes in [3H]muscimol binding. These results suggest that the direct actions of AcAl on cholinergic systems in primary cultured neurons may be more potent than those of alcohol. The results described above also suggest that alcohol-induced neurochemical alterations in vivo may be, at least in part, caused by AcAl converted from alcohol in vivo.\r"

The cerebellar membrane GABA receptor complex was also studied with binding experiments using naive AT and ANT rats. Recordings of hippocampal EEG indicated that with and without ethanol administration a rotational stimulus caused EEG synchronization in both rat lines. There was no major difference in the 2-deoxyglucose accumulation into gross brain regions between the lines. Thus, a moderate dose of ethanol does not make these rat lines distinguishable in these tests. The number of muscimol binding sites tended to be higher and that of flunitrazepam binding sites lower in the cerebellum of AT rats. These variations could not be abolished by treating the membranes with a detergent to remove possible endogenous substances bound to the receptors. The functional significance of this small difference is not known, as the relationship between receptor numbers and function is still vague. The present results indicate that the central nervous system factors involved in acute alcohol sensitivity are subtle requiring detailed study at all levels from the membrane molecules to behaving animals.\r"

Under these conditions, ethanol in vitro inhibited depolarisation-induced NA release in control preparations. In preparations from ethanol tolerant animals, ethanol enhanced depolarisation-induced release. In cultures of adrenal chromaffin cells, similar alterations in coupling between Ca2+ and catecholamine release can be seen.

However, the drug did not affect the type II neuron, which showed the opposite response to the ipsi- and contralateral rotation compared with the type I neuron. Iontophoretic application of atropine (25-50 nA) inhibited spontaneous and rotation-induced firing in both type I and II neurons.

In cerebral cortex, ethanol decreases the affinity of the high-affinity state of the receptor for isoproterenol. This may reflect a direct action of ethanol on the receptor. Ethanol also potentiates the action of guanine nucleotides on agonist binding, suggesting a second site of action at Ns. In heart, ethanol increases the proportion of low-affinity binding sites, an effect which is similar to that of guanine nucleotides, and may also indicate an action of ethanol at Ns. After chronic ethanol ingestion, the total number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors is decreased, but the proportion of high-affinity sites is increased. This change could reflect an increased sensitivity to catecholamines. In cerebral cortex, chronic ethanol results in a single, low-affinity binding site for agonist, compatible with an \"uncoupled\" receptor. Such a change also occurs during homologous desensitization, and may result from increased norepinephrine turnover during chronic ethanol ingestion. The differential responses to ethanol of similar receptors in heart and brain exemplify the specificity of ethanol's actions on various organ systems.\r"

  ".W": "An acute ethanol load administered to rats results in an enhancement in lipid peroxidation in the cerebellum, a brain area which is particularly sensitive to free radical attack. The ethanol load induces also a decrease in the cerebellar concentration of the three main endogenous anti-oxidant small molecules, i.e. alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate and glutathione. These findings are highly suggestive of a cerebellar oxidative stress due to acute ethanol administration. However this administration does not enhance brain mitochondrial superoxide production as well as cerebellar mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production. An oxidative stress could also play a role in some effects of chronic alcohol intoxication on the brain. This is particularly suggested by the beneficial effects of the administration of desferrioxamine, an iron-chelator and free radical scavenger, on physical dependence on alcohol in rodents. A speculative synthesis of the mechanisms that might be involved in such an oxidative stress on the central nervous system is presented.\r"

The cytosolic 32 Kd band associated to D-1 dopamine receptor is particularly sensible to the inhibitory action of ethanol. In vivo data indicate that chronic ethanol treatment exerts also an inhibitory effect on protein phosphorylation in striatal fractions reducing the 32P incorporation in protein bands linked to the synaptic vescicular traffic and to dopaminergic transmission. This study provides direct evidence that long term ethanol consumption alters dopaminergic transduction processes.\r"

In the presence of Gpp(NH)p (2.5 microM), however, the slope of the dose-response curve for EtOH stimulation of AC activity was biphasic. The increase in activity produced by the addition of EtOH concentration between 0 and 100 mM was much sharper than the increase in activity produced by the concentration in excess of 100 mM. EtOH increased the rate of activation of AC by guanine nucleotides and concomitantly decreased the concentration of magnesium required for half-maximal activation of AC. Prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) alone stimulated AC activity. Clonidine (3 nM-1 microM) diminished the PGE1 (1 microM)-stimulated AC by a maximum of 30%. EtOH did not alter the concentration of clonidine required for half-maximal inhibition of AC. Our results suggest that the sites of EtOH's action can be assigned to the direct action of the catalytic subunit and to the Ns-protein. Our results also indicate a substantial difference in EtOH's action on catecholamine receptor systems coupled in a stimulatory versus inhibitory manner to AC. Stimulation of AC through Ns-protein is potentiated by EtOH, but inhibition of AC through the Ni-protein is little affected by EtOH.\r"

  ".W": "Acute and chronic effects of ethanol on three pathways of hepatic protein turnover, synthesis, secretion and degradation, are reviewed and their contribution to ethanol-induced protein accumulation are discussed. In several studies it has been shown that acute dose of ethanol does not change the rate of protein synthesis in vivo, while in vitro inhibition is generally found. The reported effects of chronic ethanol treatment are more variable, since increased, unchanged and inhibited rates of protein synthesis has been measured. Thus further research is needed to clarify the role of protein synthesis in ethanol-induced accumulation of hepatocellular protein. Secretion of plasma proteins decreases both after acute and chronic administration of ethanol due to inhibition of synthesis, glycosylation and exocytosis. Although inhibition of glycosylation and exocytosis cause retention of export proteins in the liver and thus increase hepatic protein, no single plasma protein has been found to accumulate inside the hepatocyte in large amounts. This can be explained by rapid lysosomal degradation of nonsecreted plasma proteins in the hepatocyte. Acute as well as chronic ethanol treatment inhibit lysosomal protein degradation suggesting that resident proteins play an important role in the ethanol-induced accumulation of protein. Taken together, it is evident that the effect of ethanol on protein metabolism is multifunctional and the ethanol-induced changes in synthesis, secretion and degradation of proteins contribute either positively or negatively to the increase in hepatic protein mass that is frequently observed after chronic ethanol treatment.\r"

The P rats satisfy all the perceived criteria for an animal model of alcoholism: free-fed animals voluntarily drink alcoholic solutions (10-30% v/v) to intoxication; they acquire metabolic and neuronal tolerance, and develop physical dependence; they work (bar-press) to obtain the alcohol and self-administer ethanol intragastrically. Drinking in the P rats ceases when blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) reach 50-70 mg%, but BACs subsequently rise to as high as 270 mg%. BACs, 15-70 mg%, elicit increased spontaneous motor activity in the P rats, but not in the NP rats. Acute tolerance to a single hypnotic dose of ethanol develops more rapidly and persists many days longer in the P than in the NP rats. These differences in the effects of ethanol may underlie the disparate alcohol drinking behaviors of the P and NP rats. The P rats also exhibit lowered serotonin levels in certain brain regions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors curtail the alcohol drinking of the P rats, suggesting a role for serotonin in alcohol preference.\r"

The simple 'CAGE' questionnaire was a little more sensitive, but asking more questions identified more problems. A positive BT in the presence of a positive CAGE occurred in three patients and although insensitive it was absolutely specific for a serious drinking problem. A significant number of patients who attend an accident and emergency department have a drinking problem. The most effective method of detecting this is to ask patients about their drinking habits.\r"

A few patients, however, still showed continuing abnormalities even after treatment. Further study of the enzyme activation in vitro confirmed the presence of an enzyme variant, abnormal both in the ease with which the thiamin diphosphate could be removed and in requiring a high concentration of thiamin diphosphate for activation. Since the modified transketolase activation test appears not only to monitor the effectiveness of thiamin therapy but also independently to warn of persisting enzyme abnormalities, it could prove to be of general use in alcohol detoxification units.\r"

Sixteen hours after the last ethanol feeding, homogenates of cerebral cortices were prepared for isolation of the synaptosome-mitochondrial fraction. Phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional tlc and the level of individual phospholipids was determined by assaying the lipid phosphorus content. Based on protein content, there was a decrease (18%) in the level of phosphatidylserines between samples from 6 and 28 month-old mice; no age difference was observed in other phospholipids. Ethanol consumption resulted in a three-fold increase in poly-phosphoinositide level in the 6 month-old group, but the difference diminished considerably with age. The increase in poly-phosphoinositide level suggests a link between chronic ethanol administration and the receptor-mediated signal transduction mechanism involving phosphoinositide turnover. Results further indicate that animals in the younger age group are more readily influenced by the chronic effect of ethanol than those in the older age group.\r"

Cell cycle changes included a decrease in magnitude and duration of the early peak in DNA synthesis (24 hr). However, the second peak (40 hr) was increased in magnitude so that the net change was negligible. Histone synthesis increased markedly, whereas thymidine kinase activity was moderately increased. The net effect was an accelerated accumulation of DNA (0.18 mg of DNA/g liver/hr vs 0.29 mg of DNA/g liver/hr; C vs E). The M phase of the cell cycle was initially delayed by ethanol, but once initiated, it exhibited greater numbers of mitoses reaching significance at 72 hr. It is concluded that although ethanol induces multiple changes, the overall process of restoring liver mass and cell number (DNA synthesis) is not impaired.\r"

This latter effect was not observed with pentobarbital. These observations, together with the known lack of effect of high liver NAD+ levels on ethanol metabolism and the rather stable NAD+ concentration in brain cells, suggest that the effect of NA on sleeping time is not mediated by an increase in ethanol metabolism in liver or by NAD+ or NAD+-dependent reactions in brain. Our results are consistent with a direct action of NA, or some rapidly formed derivative, on a structure or process associated with brain cell functions or membranes.\r"

Three groups of 12 gravid female rats (treated groups) were intoxicated by permanent exposure to an alcohol atmosphere (19, 20 or 21 mg/l.). Three control groups of 12 gravid females were not intoxicated but had their diet reduced to the same energy intake as the treated groups. On day 21 of pregnancy, foetuses and placentas were surgically removed and individually weighed. The body-weight of foetuses was found to be lower in the treated groups than in the respective controls. Additionally the reduction of foetal weight was directly related to the severity of intoxication. Increases in placental weight were observed in the three intoxicated groups. The differences observed between foetal and placental weights may be interpreted as a foeto-protective phenomenon.\r"

Two measures of alcohol consumption were used--the amount of alcohol consumed in the previous week in g of absolute alcohol per day, and the typical peak consumption in the last six months. Three symptoms related to heavy drinking were studied: (1) inability to cut down or stop drinking, referred to here as subjective, relative loss of control over drinking; (2) morning shakes and malaise relieved by drinking, termed morning drinks; (3) amnesia induced by alcohol, referred to as blackouts. Ten per cent of the men had all three alcohol symptoms and 52% had no alcohol symptoms at all. Twenty-nine per cent had lost control over the amount they drank.

The results support this hypothesis. Generally, respondents who are more acculturated have more liberal attitudes independent of sex and age.

  ".W": "Thromboembolic events in very short-term ventricular assistance have been uncommon. However, patients who are bridged or have long-term artificial heart implantations have almost uniformly experienced serious thromboembolic sequelae. Anticoagulation regimens for this form of circulatory assistance have varied but results are inconclusive. Intravenous heparin is commonly used, while low molecular weight Dextran, aspirin, and other antithrombotic agents are occasionally used. Mechanical cardiac valve failures requiring reoperation are due primarily to thrombosis, tissue overgrowth, and structural failure. Reoperations of tissue valves indicate sterile degeneration, usually related to calcification and tears, as the principal cause of failure. Despite improvements in biomaterials and an appreciation of the influence of disordered flow on graft patency, antithrombotic therapy represents the most clinically relevant approach to prevention of occlusion of vascular prostheses. The location of neointimal hyperplasia in vascular prostheses is different from that in vein grafts, the effect concentrating at the anastomosis. No clear rationale exists for antithrombotic therapy for hyperplasia in this instance. However, a rationale does exist for early antithrombotic therapy to reduce surface thrombogenicity. The lessons learned from clinical trials of antithrombotic therapy in the case of vein grafts might be profitably studied with regard to synthetic grafts and other artificial organs. Early low-dose aspirin and, possibly, dextran-40 treatment are justified in this case. However, continuation of these therapies past the early healing phase does not appear warranted. Clinical and experimental studies with hemodialysis and other membranes suggest complement activation through the alternate pathway is commonly observed; the biologic responses are consistent with the known properties of C5a. Factors governing anaphylatoxin exposure can be ascribed to the nucleophilicity and number of surface reactive groups. Elimination of surface reactive groups, or binding of bystander plasma proteins such as albumin, may be expected to limit complement activation.\r"

There were 301 deaths over an average follow up period of 9.4 years and 138 (46%) of these were sudden. Life table techniques permitted the estimation of mortality up to 18 years after the index event. The proportion of sudden deaths showed a decrease with length of follow up. In those who were non-smokers and in those aged less than 45 years on admission sudden deaths in the first two years were very common (80% (95% confidence interval: 69%-91%) and 79% (95% confidence interval: 68%-90%) respectively). The proportion of sudden deaths in the remaining 16 years of follow up was related inversely to age at initial attack. After the first two years of follow up sudden death rates were similar in those who continued to smoke and those who stopped smoking, although those who continued to smoke had a significantly higher overall mortality. The risk of sudden death should be borne in mind when planning the investigation and rehabilitation of young and non-smoking subjects presenting with a first coronary event.\r"

The effects of several clinical variables on subsequent outcome were examined, including the effects of treatment, which was determined by the clinician caring for the patient and was not randomly allocated. In order of importance, frequent ventricular extrasystoles, non-treatment with amiodarone, low mean arterial pressure, and a diagnosis of coronary artery disease were associated with a poor prognosis, with each of these variables providing extra predictive information independently of the others. Initial serum potassium concentration and treadmill exercise time also carried further weak but independent prognostic information. Neither treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors nor digoxin appeared to affect outcome. Left ventricular function (as reflected by M mode echocardiography) and the dose of diuretic also failed to predict outcome. There did, however, appear to be a reduction in the frequency of sudden death when angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors were given. Further studies are required to confirm the adverse prognostic significance of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure and the possible benefit associated with amiodarone treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty nine survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unassociated with an acute myocardial infarction were referred for intracardiac electrophysiological study. Thirty patients who had no clinically significant coronary artery disease (group 1) were compared with 29 who did (group 2). Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was induced in significantly more patients in group 2 than in group 1 (69% vs 40%). Median duration of follow up, which was achieved in all patients, was 31 months in group 1 and 14 months in group 2. In group 1, an effective treatment was identified electrophysiologically in seven patients, and none died; an arrhythmia was induced, but no effective treatment was identified in five patients, and one patient died subsequently; an arrhythmia was not induced in 18 patients, 15 of whom were treated empirically with anti-arrhythmic drugs, and one died. In group 2, effective treatment was identified electrophysiologically in seven patients and three died (two of pump failure) during follow up. In 13 an arrhythmia was induced but no effective drug was identified, and six died or had a recurrence; in another nine patients without inducible arrhythmias, six subsequently died or had a recurrence. A Cox proportional hazards analysis identified previous myocardial infarction as the only predictor of recurrence. Patients without coronary artery disease who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a low inducibility rate at electrophysiological study and an excellent prognosis compared with patients who have coronary artery disease. Electrophysiological testing seemed to be of value in predicting the response to antiarrhythmic drugs, but non-inducibility of arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease was of no predictive value.\r"

There was significantly less heart rate variation in deep breathing in the patients with coronary artery disease than in the healthy subjects. Twenty patients (32%) with coronary artery disease had lower than normal variation in heart rate. The patients with chest pain showed an intermediate heart rate response to deep breathing. Sinus arrhythmia in the patients with coronary artery disease was not related to the functional class, medication, number or location of narrowed vessels, or to the left ventricular ejection fraction, and end diastolic pressure. These results suggest that impairment of the parasympathetic nervous function is common in coronary artery disease.\r"

The results were compared with similar studies in 54 subjects who died of heart block and in whom sinus node function was normal (group 2). Although no significant lesion obstructing the blood flow to the sinus node was seen in the majority of those in group 1, there were abnormalities in seven cases, with reduced filling of the sinus node artery in five. In group 2 the sinus node artery filled normally in all cases despite major disease of the parent vessel in three. The combination of contralateral coronary artery disease with extensive atrial anastomoses was actively sought because this arrangement might predispose to a steal phenomenon. Such conditions were fully met in three cases in group 1 and two cases in group 2, and were found to a lesser extent in a further two cases in group 1 and three in group 2. Although coronary artery disease was unlikely to be the principal cause of sinus node dysfunction in most of the cases studied it was relatively common and may have been a factor in about one third. Improved survival after myocardial infarction may increase the number of patients with chronic sinoatrial disorder of ischaemic origin.\r"

The role of magnetic resonance imaging in assessing the anatomy of the central pulmonary arteries, the origin and course of systemic collateral arteries, and the patency of surgical shunts has been studied with the aim of reducing the need for invasive angiography. Transverse, coronal, and sagittal images were obtained in ten adult patients and assessed without knowledge of surgical and angiographic data. Central pulmonary artery anatomy varied from full development to complete absence. Transverse slices showed hypoplastic arteries particularly well and the findings accorded with surgical and angiographic data in all patients. The origin and proximal course of 15 large collaterals were identified on the magnetic resonance images and 18 were identified by surgical and angiographic data. Magnetic resonance imaging did not show their distal connections; if such information is required angiography will be needed. Five surgical shunts were shown to be patent and two occluded at surgery and angiography, and this was confirmed on the magnetic resonance images. The patency of a further four shunts was uncertain, but they were not seen by magnetic resonance and were presumed to be occluded.\r"

The great vessels were visualised in the parasternal long axis and short axis views. All measurements were made in end diastole and end systole by the leading edge method. The internal diameter (inner surface to inner surface) of the pulmonary trunk was also measured. The diameters of the great vessels correlated best with the square root of body surface area. Individual variability in cardiac growth gave a wide scatter of normal values. This was controlled for by calculating the ratio of the pulmonary trunk to aortic root for each subject. This ratio showed little individual variability and, except for the neonatal period, was remarkably constant throughout infancy and childhood (1.06 (0.06)). In the first 24 hours of life the ratio of the pulmonary trunk to the aortic root was significantly larger (1.29 (0.12)) but within one week it decreased to the \"normal\" ratio found in the older age groups. These normal data should be useful in assessing patients with congenital heart disease, particularly those in whom pulmonary blood flow is abnormal.\r"

  ".W": "The histopathological appearances of seven coronary arteries obtained from four patients after repeated percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were analysed. A complex picture was found; typically there were ruptured atherosclerotic plaques, plaque dissection, and a fibrous tissue response. The histopathological appearance of older and more recent fibrous lesions was different. Older lesions contained more collagen and elastin fibres, whereas recent ones had more loosely arranged connective tissue containing abundant glycosaminoglycan and readily identifiable cells. The fibrous tissues tended to be damaged at the sites of previous injury and where the vessel wall was thinnest. In five of the seven arteries there was evidence of a repeated fibrous response to injury with partial or total rupture of the original media. In one instance a repair response within a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque had caused restenosis. The results indicate that restenosis after repeated percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, like restenosis after a first procedure, is mainly the result of fibrocellular tissue response to injury of the wall tissues. Because older (that is more mature) repair tissue contains fewer cells and more connective elements than younger repair tissue (that is the loosely arranged connective tissue found soon after angioplasty), when it is disrupted by a further angioplasty procedure it is less capable of producing tissue that will obstruct the lumen. This may explain why in the majority of patients with restenosis repeated percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is successful. The present study also showed that occasionally plaque haemorrhages may become organised and incorporated into the pre-existing atherosclerotic lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Eight elderly patients (mean (SD) age 72.6 (8.5) years) with severe calcified stenosis of the aortic valve were considered for transluminal balloon dilatation in the Thoraxcenter between March and November 1986. In one patient the procedure could not be performed because of technical difficulties. Balloons of increasing diameter (13-25 mm) were successively passed retrogradely from the femoral artery and manually inflated with pressures of 400-600 kPa (4-6 atmospheres). Post-dilatation, there were significant changes in left ventricular pressures (from 237/21 to 204/13 mm Hg), mean systolic gradient (from 66 to 41 mm Hg, systolic aortic flow (from 172 to 202 ml/s, and aortic valve area (from 0.47 to 0.74 cm2); the cardiac index did not increase significantly (from 2.4 to 2.5 l/min/m2). One patient developed a pseudoaneurysm at the site of the femoral artery puncture that required surgical repair two months after the procedure; one patient experienced an acute left hemianopia during the procedure but had almost completely recovered at discharge. Five patients maintained a clinical improvement at a mean follow up time of 4.5 months after the procedure; two patients underwent aortic valve replacement, one because of minimal haemodynamic improvement after aortic balloon dilatation and persistence of severe dyspnoea and the other because of late recurrence of symptoms caused by restenosis after a successful procedure. Aortic balloon dilatation provides an alternative treatment for patients who are poor surgical candidates for cardiac or extracardiac reasons. At this stage the limited haemodynamic improvements suggest that the treatment can only be regarded as palliative, although proposed technical advances may achieve better immediate results in the failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most common malformations were ductus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect and there were 77 cases in which connections between chambers or between chambers and great arteries were anomalous (68 liveborn; 37 male and 31 female: nine stillborn; two male and seven female). No difference in sex distribution or seasonal variation was found between those with congenital heart disease and those without. Extracardiac malformations and chromosomal abnormalities were more often seen in children with congenital heart malformation than those without (30.3% vs 16.6%).

  ".W": "Somatosensory potentials evoked in response to median nerve stimulation were studied in 10 patients during surgery under general anaesthesia with halothane (five patients) or enflurane (five patients). Bipolar scalp responses (near field) and scalp to non-cephalic reference (far field) potentials were recorded before the induction of anaesthesia, and after 15 min stabilization at each of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% end-tidal concentrations of anaesthetic agent. Both agents produced similar effects. The latency of the bipolar responses was increased and the amplitude decreased. The amplitude of the far field, subcortically generated, potentials measured from the scalp to non-cephalic electrodes did not decrease as much as the near field potential with increasing concentrations of volatile anaesthetic, although the latency of the potential recorded at the frontal electrode increased. At higher anaesthetic concentrations the virtual elimination of the near field potential caused the frontal and rolandic potentials to appear to be identical. Since far field somatosensory evoked potentials are preserved during deep anaesthesia, they should be considered for use when measurement of evoked responses is required for monitoring purposes.\r"

The mean clearance was 17.9 +/- 8.3 ml min-1 kg-1, the volume of distribution at steady state was 2.1 +/- 0.24 litre kg-1 and the mean residence time was 134 +/- 47 min. The pharmacokinetic model used for the i.v. data was easily modified to suit the plasma concentration curves obtained on rectal administration.

When the patients were ventilated with the mixture, there was a significant increase in PaO2 of 2.74 +/- 1.08 kPa (P less than 0.002) over control values obtained while the subjects were awake and breathing air spontaneously. Changing the inspired gas from nitrous oxide in oxygen to air while ventilation was held constant resulted in a significant decrease in PaO2 of 2.22 +/- 0.94 kPa (P less than 0.001). However, these PaO2 values were not statistically significantly different from control values. We conclude that continuous accurate measurement of arterial oxygen tension is feasible provided that corrections are made in the electrode system for anaesthetic gases. We also found that the increase in PaO2 when 79% nitrous oxide in 21% oxygen was used, when compared with air, was lower than values proposed by previous investigators. The decrease in PaO2 when the inspired gas was changed back to room air was less than that found by others and there was no evidence of hypoxia when patients were ventilated on air alone after inspiring the mixture.\r"

Furthermore, fluoride and molybdate had no effect on MHS skeletal muscle contractility. Cyclic AMP content, basal adenylate cyclase activity and molybdate-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of MHS skeletal muscle was not significantly different from that of control muscle.

The embedding of the pilot tube within the wall of SCT imparts a D-shaped lumen which is more marked in 6.0- and 6.5-mm tubes. As a result, there is a 15% reduction in the lumen of a 6.5-mm SCT. All sizes of SCT studied had a smaller outer diameter compared with the corresponding sizes of NCT and thus occupied less space in the trachea. In sizes 6.0 and 6.5 mm, the SCT was found to have distinct disadvantages, such as increased resistance to ventilation of up to twice that of NCT, and turbulent flow even at a minute volume of 5 litre min-1. SCT, size 9.0 mm, however offered marginally less resistance compared with NCT of the same size.\r"

Seven patients with DPU and all patients with CRU had positive early cutaneous reactions (15 min) (ECR), while six of the DPU and only one of the CRU patients had positive late cutaneous reactions (6h) (LCR). In the CRU patients, food allergens caused a positive ECR in one and no LCR in any of the cases, while two DPU patients had ECR and four had LCR to food allergens. The one patient with CRU and a positive LCR reacted to fungi, while of the DPU patients, five had LCRs to fungi, two to other inhalants, three to NaCl and one to histamine. None of the DPU patients lost their delayed pressure reactivity while on a diet lacking the food allergens to which they gave positive reactions. These results show that DPU patients have more frequent LCR than do CRU patients. They do not, however, confirm earlier reports claiming that the majority of DPU patients are allergic to food allergens and that their disease can be cured by elimination of the offending agents from their diet.\r"

Discs prepared from women delivered by caesarean section before the onset of labour showed a significant decrease in PGE output at relaxin concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml; the effect was abolished at higher relaxin concentrations. Discs obtained from women delivered after labour of spontaneous onset responded to the addition of relaxin (4-8 micrograms/ml) with a significant increase in PGE output, although this increase was only evident in patients in whom labour had started with intact membranes. These results suggest that relaxin, which is present in decidua and chorion laeve at term, may have a paracrine effect on the amnion, inhibiting PGE production during continuing pregnancy but favouring its production during spontaneous labour.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of rest versus hard work on fetal growth at the end of pregnancy was assessed prospectively in a population of women who normally work hard during pregnancy. A group of 554 women living in Kalima area (Central Zaire) was admitted for rest in a maternity village for a median duration of 22 days. Self-selection, age, parity, number of living children, socio-economic status, maternal weight and height and gestational age were controlled for. Energy intake estimated in a sample of women in the maternity village and a sample of those staying at home was similar. Protein intake was found to be higher in the resting women. The duration of rest had a strong influence on birth-weight and length in the newborn females but to a lesser extent in the newborn males. There was a 7.5-fold decrease in the rate of low birth-weight in girls when the duration of maternal rest was greater than 21 days. In boys the low-birthweight rate remained unchanged. Although this sex difference could not be explained it is concluded that, in developing countries, avoidance of heavy work can help to raise birthweight and perhaps reduce perinatal mortality.\r"

Twenty-five of the 30 women with both tubes present desired pregnancy; 17 (68%) conceived again, 14 (56%) had at least one intrauterine pregnancy and 3 (12%) had a repeat extrauterine pregnancy. Twenty-six of the women with a solitary tube desired pregnancy, 12 (46%) of them had at least one intrauterine pregnancy, and 10 (38.5%) had a repeat extrauterine pregnancy. It was concluded that the incidence of intrauterine pregnancy after conservative surgery in patients with both tubes present is not lower than after radical surgery, and that the incidence of extrauterine pregnancy is not higher. The intrauterine pregnancy rate in patients with a solitary tube is high and still higher than the best results available with in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Therefore conservative surgery is indicated in these patients despite the high incidence of repeat extrauterine pregnancy. Since most of the patients who conceived did so during the first year following the operation, we recommend that patients try to conceive immediately.\r"

The concentration of thyroid hormones was little affected by the raised levels of TSH or hCG, except when the concentration of the latter rose to high levels, usually above 100,000 i.u./l.

During normal pregnancy we found a decrease in whole blood viscosity at all shear rates until 29 weeks gestation, followed by a smaller increase between 30 and 37 weeks, which was most pronounced at higher shear rates, especially in nulliparae. The changes in whole blood viscosity were to a great extent determined by the changes in haematocrit and plasma viscosity. Haematocrit was more important for whole blood viscosity at lower shear rates, while plasma viscosity had more influence on high shear blood viscosity. The continuous increase in red cell aggregation had no demonstrable influence on low shear blood viscosity as measured in vitro in a rotational viscometer.\r"

PGE output (fmol/mg dry weight/2 h) in the amnions from uncomplicated preterm deliveries was low (median 486, range 232-3203, n = 7) compared with the values obtained after spontaneous labour at term (5529, 1722-14,226, n = 15). In amnions from preterm deliveries complicated by acute chorioamnionitis or round cell infiltration there was massive release of PGE (15,262, 10,905-27,640, n = 5) which was accompanied by an increase in LTB4 production. Inflammatory infiltration of the fetal membranes results in a huge increase in PG production which could cause preterm labour.\r"

Although the last CRP before delivery was higher in patients with histological chorioamnionitis (P = 0.007), considerable overlap between infected and non-infected pregnancies occurred, precluding the use of CRP as a diagnostic test if published normal levels were used. When upper limits were set at 30, 35, or 40 mg/l, the last CRP before delivery proved 90, 95 and 100% specific and 88, 92 and 100% positively predictive of infection in singleton pregnancies. Such high specificities are needed to prevent inappropriate intervention based on false positive results. We therefore propose upper limits for single estimations of 30, 35, or 40 mg/l depending on the relative risks of preterm delivery versus infection at various gestational ages. In addition, consecutive values greater than 20 mg/l appeared highly predictive of infection.\r"

A significant regression coefficient was found for energy intake at week 17 on maternal fat accretion. Energy intake was not significantly correlated with infant birthweight, not even when physical activity and maternal lean body mass were taken into account. Thus in a well-nourished Swedish population, energy intake is positively related to maternal fat accretion but not to the birthweight of term infants.\r"

All 16 infants born to mothers who had taken colchicine during pregnancy were healthy.

Two of the 14 assessable patients with recurrent disease (14%) had a complete response with no disease found histologically in one, and seven (50%) had a partial response. Although the actuarial median survival of all 19 patients with recurrent disease was 8 months, five patients have remained free from tumour progression for a median of 17 months from start of chemotherapy. Six of the 10 assessable patients receiving initial chemotherapy (60%) had a complete response (confirmed histologically in two) and two (20%) had a partial response. Nine patients had additional treatment with radiotherapy and or surgery. Although only four of the patients remain disease-free at 61, 51, 7 and 4 months, all but two were initially FIGO stage IV. Although cisplatin-induced emesis is controllable and the side-effects of methotrexate can be avoided, the POMB regimen remains potentially toxic. The small number of patients with very advanced disease who are long-term survivors prompts us to study further the role of aggressive chemotherapy as the initial treatment of patients with visceral or nodal involvement from carcinoma of the cervix.\r"

A theory was advanced that a primary collagen disturbance might be involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The connective tissue in the body has a supportive function in almost all the organs. The tensile strength and elasticity of connective tissue is mainly due to the presence of collagen fibres and elastic fibres, which also maintain the shape of the tissues. There are many different types of collagen, three of which are discussed in this paper. Type I collagen is found in tendons, skin, and numerous other organs, for example the eye. Type III is found mainly in the blood vessels but is also present in other tissues with a mesodermal origin, and type IV is found in the basement membranes. To elucidate the precise distribution of collagen types in the ocular structures an immunhistochemical study was undertaken in normal human eyes. The amino acids proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, which are characteristic of collagen, were also analysed. Collagen types I, III, and IV were found in the lamina cribrosa, the trabecular meshwork, and the retrolaminary optic nerve. In contrast, only type I was found in the sclera.\r"

In pseudopapilloedema the retinal vascular fluorescence and slight disc head fluorescence with sharp margins at 30 minutes markedly declined by 60 minutes. These features were similar to our earlier findings with oral fluorescein in the normal fundi of children. Of the 30 eyes with suspected or incipient papilloedema late disc and peripapillary 'staining', polar or diffuse was observed in 12, the 60 minutes fluorescence being more than at 30 minutes in nine and of equal in intensity in three. In these 12 'positive' eyes, and four more of the 18 'negative' eyes, the retinal vascular fluorescence at 60 minutes was significantly more than at 30 minutes. The problems of interpretation after oral fluorescein in the early diagnosis of papilloedema in children and the possible fallacies are discussed.\r"

Peripheral fibres have a mean width of 10.2 micron, the central fibres 11.9 micron, and the central fibres with suture 15.8 micron. Measurements were made of the taper (becoming narrower towards the suture) and flare (becoming wider towards the suture). The peripheral fibres have a mean taper of 0.3 micron per 100 micron. The central fibres have a mean flare of 0.6 micron per 100 micron, and the central fibres with suture have a mean flare of 2.4 micron per 100 micron. These differences are highly significant (p less than 10(-6]. From these measurements the overall shape of the average lens fibre was estimated. This fibre tapers as it passes forward from the equator to the peripheral extent of the lens sutures and then flares increasingly as the junction with the lens suture is approached. A mean increase in peripheral lens fibre width with age at 0.028 micron per year was demonstrated. This is significant (p = 0.042). No difference in fibre width was found in diabetics and non-diabetics.\r"

The characteristic findings associated with this entity are a visual acuity of 6/21 or worse, nystagmus, and a typical ophthalmoscopic appearance of the macular area, including absent or abnormal maculofoveal reflexes, unclear definition of the maculofoveal area, and capillaries running abnormally close to the presumed macular area, some of them even crossing the horizontal meridian. Fluorescein angiography revealed a variable and incomplete filtering effect of the choroidal fluorescence in the macular area, suggesting abnormalities in the amount and distribution of macular pigments. The fundal findings of isolated foveal hypoplasia, although typical, are very subtle and often difficult to detect, especially because of the accompanying nystagmus. For this reason we suspect that foveal hypoplasia may be more common than is generally believed.\r"

There was a 3 to 1 male to female preponderance and a peak age of presentation between 20 and 30 years. The main aetiological factors were trauma 65.6% and inflammation 21.7%. Of the trauma patients 80% had sustained minor trauma (abrasions or foreign material to the cornea or conjunctiva) and of the patients with inflammation 71% had either conjunctivitis or blepharitis. There was a trend towards increased numbers in the summer months. The percentage of patients with inflammatory disease was higher in the early summer and the winter months. Nine of the 11 patients with acute angle closure glaucoma presented between November and February. All patients were initially seen by the accident and emergency medical staff, who were able to treat 69% without further consultation. No serious pathology was overlooked. It is suggested that, in the district general hospital setting, co-operation between the eye and the accident and emergency departments can be to their mutual benefit.\r"

Calcium oxalate calculi were the most common irrespective of race. Whewellite calculi were equally distributed in both race groups, while weddelite stones appeared to be much less common amongst blacks; the opposite applied for struvite and the rare ammonium acid urate stones. The other calculi were approximately equally distributed between the two race groups. A statistically significant rising trend in the prevalence of renal stones in blacks, accompanied by changes in the ratios of the major stone forming constituents, have been a prominent feature of this survey. However, the aforementioned remained unchanged in white patients. Contrary to previous impressions, total urates exceed phosphates in whites as a major stone forming constituent. The composition of upper urinary tract stones in blacks, during the 3-year period 1981 to 1983, was very similar to the composition previously reported for the Sudanese. The profile of renal stones in blacks over the last 3 years, however, is now becoming substantially different from that of the other previously reported surveys and may be approaching that of their white compatriots. A change in the dietary patterns in blacks is occurring which is also reflected in an increasing incidence of ischaemic heart disease and which may also be responsible for the observed changes in renal stones.\r"

The voiding pressure was recorded 28 times and ranged from 44 to 257 cm H2O (average 141). These data were higher than expected and we recommend further studies on the maximum voiding pressure. On voiding, various patterns of pressure curve were observed and in the monophasic pressure curve, which probably shows normal urination, there was a time difference between urine flow and voiding pressure curve. Our new method may be useful not only as a sensory device for neurogenic bladder patients but also as an experimental system to study the effect of drugs on autonomic nerves.\r"

Mean serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were raised, with two patients showing increased values of the hormone above our normal limits. Our findings indicate that mild secondary hyperparathyroidism is a feature of these patients. However, it cannot be excluded that both the reduced serum phosphate and TmP/GFR values may be related, at least in some cases, to the effects of the tumour itself on tubular reabsorption of phosphate.\r"

No significant differences could be found between the normal men and women, the male and female stone formers, or between the patients and their normal controls with regard to the excretion of oxalate and glycosaminoglycans, and the urinary pH. The normal women exhibited significantly lower urinary volumes and excreted less calcium per day than did the other subject groups. The excretion of calcium by the female stone formers was indistinguishable from that of both groups of men. The male and female stone formers did not differ from their corresponding control groups with regard to the excretion of urate, but both groups of male subjects had significantly higher daily urate excretions than did either female category. This was attributed to the greater body weights of the men. There were no discernible differences between any of the subject groups with regard to the inhibitory effects of their urines on calcium oxalate crystal growth, but urines from both groups of female subjects demonstrated a significantly greater inhibitory influence on crystal aggregation than did those of the men. It would appear that the relatively low incidence of uninfected calcium oxalate urolithiasis in women compared with men may be attributable to (a) a lower daily calcium excretion and (b) a higher inhibitory activity of their urines towards crystal aggregation.\r"

A double J stent was used in 16 patients instead of a more traditional external drainage technique. The use of the double J stent for splintage of a pyeloplasty anastomosis was associated with a marked reduction in hospital stay and with fewer post-operative complications when compared with external drainage techniques. The double J stent is recommended in cases where a pyeloplasty anastomosis is to be splinted.\r"

Two of these had tumour thrombus extension up to the level of the hepatic veins and in four the extension was above the level of the diaphragm, two of which entered the atrium. Thrombus was removed en bloc at radical nephrectomy. Six patients are still alive, with a mean survival of 22 months. There was no correlation between the level of tumour thrombus and perinephric extension or indeed any correlation between tumour thrombus level and overall survival. It is suggested that tumour thrombus in the inferior vena cava, in the absence of metastatic disease, should be managed by radical surgery.\r"

The commonest presenting symptoms were flank and abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea and polyuria. Physical examination was usually normal, expect for the presence of hypertension. Anaemia and elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate were usually present. Proteinuria was found in less than a third of patients at presentation and significant bacteriuria was uncommon. The correct diagnosis was made or suspected in very few patients before referral. The cumulative actuarial survival rate was 86% at 1 year and 78% at 2 years. Seventeen patients died; they were significantly older and more uraemic at the time of referral than those who survived. A few patients did well with either corticosteroid therapy or ureterolysis alone. In the majority, both operation and steroid treatment were necessary. In bilateral obstruction with residual function in both kidneys, bilateral ureterolysis proved superior to unilateral operation (each followed by steroid therapy) in conserving renal function. Operation alone or steroid therapy alone should be considered in cases where steroids or surgery respectively present particular hazards. The less traumatic unilateral operation should be considered in poor risk patients and in those whose renal function is absent on one side. In many survivors, disease activity has persisted for many years. Life-long follow-up is recommended.\r"

Spontaneous passage of a stone occurred in 100 patients and 34 required surgical intervention. Stones measuring 5 mm or less in maximum dimension passed spontaneously in 92% of cases; stones measuring 6 mm or more had only a 28% chance of passing. Of 34 surgical procedures 19 were endoscopic. In three cases a stone was removed under vision with ureteroscope and Dormia basket. In five patients ureteric dilatation before attempted ureteroscopy permitted later passage of the stone. In 1986 similar results were obtained with ureteroscopic stone removal performed in three cases. Fewer open operations and more Dormia basket extractions were performed in 1986. In this series the size of the stone was closely related to outcome. The high chance of spontaneous passage (75% in 1985 and 84% in 1986) puts the need for surgical intervention, and in particular ureteroscopy, into perspective in the management of patients with ureteric colic.\r"

Spontaneous contractions developed more often in unstable and hyper-reflexic muscle and were of greater amplitude, frequency and basal tension. Electrical field stimulation caused a frequency-dependent contraction which was largely abolished by both tetrodotoxin (TTX) and atropine in all three muscle types. Comparison of their frequency response curves demonstrated a significantly greater sensitivity than that of unstable and hyper-reflexic muscle to low stimulation frequencies. Acetylcholine caused a dose-related contractile response in all muscle types. There were no significant differences between the dose response curves of unstable and hyper-reflexic muscle, and those of normal muscle. The results suggest that the pathophysiology of the involuntary detrusor contraction is common to both idiopathic detrusor instability and detrusor hyper-reflexia and that this is related to a disorder of an intrinsic neuromodulatory mechanism within the detrusor muscle.\r"

The addition of lignocaine to the alkaline solution further increased bladder capacity in patients without bladder outflow obstruction. In all patients with flow rates of less than 10 ml/s, lignocaine reduced bladder capacity. There was a qualitative improvement in instability on using an alkaline filling medium. However, in three patients with outflow obstruction lignocaine caused the instability to worsen. Possible mechanisms for these findings are discussed.\r"

Fifty-nine patients have undergone the clam procedure as part or all of their reconstruction in the past 4 years. Although uncontrolled incontinence was the commonest indication, impaired renal function was the indication in 14 patients and need for undiversion in seven. Currently all but four are voiding satisfactorily or are on intermittent self-catheterisation, though six have significant stress incontinence. The clam procedure is easier, quicker and as satisfactory as substitution cystoplasty in selected cases.\r"

A retrospective study of 69 superficial and 15 invasive transitional cell carcinomas of bladder and a prospective study of 43 mucosal biopsies were performed in order to assess the usefulness of immunohistochemical staining of the basement membrane components, type IV collagen and laminin as prognostic indicators in superficial bladder cancer. There was a significant association between pT category and basement membrane staining. The incidence of progression of superficial tumours with patchy or absent basement membranes was significantly greater than those with complete basement membranes but there was no association with superficial recurrence. Biopsies of dysplastic epithelium had thickened and reduplicated basement membranes, possibly as a result of increased cell turnover. The results suggest that a balance exists between basement membrane production and degradation in early malignancy. This technique may be of value in the early identification of microinvasion and in the prediction of subsequent progression.\r"

Symptoms were scored by means of a standardised questionnaire and urodynamic studies were performed. Within this study group, high obstructive symptom scores were associated with low flow rates and high urethral resistance. However, high voiding pressures were not associated statistically with low flow rates or obstructive symptoms. Voiding pressures followed a unimodal, parametric distribution and a significant number of men had voiding pressures within the normal range: 9.1% had voiding pressures less than 55 cm H2O and 27.7% less than 75 cm H2O. Irritative symptoms, on the other hand, correlated significantly with obstructive symptoms, high voiding pressures and urethral resistance. Furthermore, high voiding pressures were associated with small cystometric bladder capacities, low compliance and detrusor instability. Whilst these clinical and urodynamic parameters were associated statistically with voiding pressures, none proved specific in being able to identify men with voiding pressures in the high or low end of the range.\r"

Increased volumes of residual urine were associated significantly with increasing age, low peak flow rate and high urethral resistance. However, weak voiding pressures were uncommon and did not correlate with increased residual volumes. Increased residual volumes also correlated significantly with a high resting detrusor pressure and a high detrusor pressure rise during the filling phase, but there was a wide scatter of the results for pressure rise and patients could not be classified into groups on the basis of this parameter. Whilst detrusor decompensation was not manifest by weak voiding pressures in patients with increased residual volumes, impairment of the ability of the detrusor to empty the infused cystometric capacity during the subsequent voiding study correlated with increased residual volumes. These data are consistent with theories relating bladder outflow obstruction to the development of increased volumes of residual urine in men undergoing prostatectomy.\r"

Our studies on T-lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell target-cell lysis reveal that seminal plasma mediated suppression is dose-dependent and temperature-dependent, and that cells which have been activated are less susceptible to suppression. In the case of mitogen-induced T-cell responses this results in a decrease in the expression of the Interleukin-2 receptor whose generation is essential to T-cell proliferation. These studies provide further evidence about suppression of the immune response by seminal plasma. This may be a contributory factor in the aetiology of AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases, infertility and malignancies of the urogenital tract including carcinoma of the cervix.\r"

Using intracorporeal papaverine, Doppler duplex scanning, cardiovascular reflex testing and skin thermal threshold monitoring, the vascular and neurological components were assessed in each of three clinical groups with probable or overt neuropathy. These comprised spinal injury, diabetes and pelvic trauma. Anatomical detail of the penis was well seen using these techniques. In 15 patients with spinal injuries, although the aetiology was predominantly neurological, six exhibited poor flow in the deep penile arteries following injection of papaverine. This was associated with poor erections in these patients, suggesting a vascular pathology. In 27 patients with diabetes the results showed a mixed pattern. Vascular disease was almost universal, combined with varying degrees of autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, and only three had full erections with papaverine. Those with pelvic trauma (8 patients) also had a mixed picture, although some had good erections following papaverine injection. Duplex Doppler scanning of the deep penile arteries correlated with the quality of papaverine-induced erection. Thermal testing was a highly sensitive indicator of small nerve fibre dysfunction, possibly at an earlier stage than standard autonomic testing. A vascular component to impotence was shown to be common in those with neurological impairment, and may alter management.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) has become an established method of relieving posthepatic jaundice. This study comprises 399 patients in whom 472 EBD procedures were performed during a 5 year period; 272 patients had malignant obstruction, 36 had a benign stricture, 79 had common duct stones and 12 patients had other benign conditions requiring drainage. A 7F double pigtail endoprosthesis was used in the majority of patients and was inserted with an Olympus JF-1T duodenoscope. Ninety-two per cent of the prostheses were correctly positioned, and 88 per cent of these functioned well with relief of symptoms. The 30-day mortality was 22 per cent and one-third of these deaths were due to the procedure, septicaemia being the dominant hazard. This was more marked if the obstruction was not relieved satisfactorily. Antibiotic cover was not used routinely and had not been prescribed in any of the fatal cases. This omission probably made a significant contribution to the septicaemia. Acute pancreatitis and haemorrhage were rare complications and both were probably related to the coincidental sphincterotomy. Prostheses intended for permanent relief of malignant obstruction remained patent for 2-3 months (median) with a wide range of 1-618 days. Survival among these patients is so short, that one or two EBD procedures will keep the majority of patients free from symptoms related to biliary obstruction, and only two patients needed more than three procedures. Fifty-one patients with pancreatic head carcinoma had EBD as a bypass before an intended operation. Only 16 patients actually had a resection. The median survival among the 51 patients was 106 days (compared with 59 days among 100 patients with a permanent prosthetic bypass). Only one patient with a very small periampullary carcinoma has survived for more than 3 years. Forty-seven patients are dead. Among the 51 patients in whom radical resection was intended two-thirds were actually treated by permanent surgical or prosthetic bypass.\r"

Postoperative retained stones were detected in 37 patients (14 per cent), causing complications in 54 per cent. Peroperative postexploratory cholangiography did not significantly reduce the incidence of this problem. None of the 12 patients who had postexploratory choledochoscopy had retained stones. Five patients (1.9 per cent) died, three of whom had duct procedures in addition to supraduodenal exploration and two of whom had retained stones. It is concluded that common bile duct exploration has a high associated morbidity, particularly due to sepsis and retained stones.\r"

The overall operative morbidity was 21.7 per cent. Two patients died within 30 days of operation. One patient died of septicaemia after emergency dilatation of stricture while another died of sepsis from a leakage after hepatotomy and plastic repair. The median follow-up for the 44 patients who survived the operation was 43 months. All strictures reformed after dilatation within 2 months. Acute cholangitis occurred in six patients, two after dilatation of strictures (with documented recurrent stone formation in one), two after biliary-enteric anastomosis and two after liver resection. Thus, good clinical results were obtained in 38 out of 44 patients (86.4 per cent).\r"

We have reviewed 32 consecutive patients presenting with both conditions over ten years which represents 23.0 per cent of all cases of gallstone-related acute cholangitis and 14.4 per cent of all cases of biliary acute pancreatitis admitted during the same period. The majority of patients were elderly (median 76 years) and female (75 per cent). Five patients had previously undergone cholecystectomy. Eleven patients were clinically shocked (34 per cent) and blood cultures were positive in 9/14 cases (64 per cent). Twenty patients (63 per cent) had a predicted severe attack of acute pancreatitis (modified Glasgow criteria). Common bile duct (CBD) stones were identified in 15 of 23 patients with successful ERCP. Of these 23 patients, 9 were treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) alone, 5 by ES and surgery, 4 by surgery alone and 5 were treated conservatively. There was one death (4.3 per cent). Nine patients were managed without cholangiography; four had surgery and five were treated conservatively. There were three deaths (33 per cent; P = 0.10). Evidence of recent CBD stone passage was apparent in eight patients (25 per cent) compared with five out of eighty-seven patients (5.7 per cent) with acute cholangitis alone (P less than 0.005). The results indicate that ERCP and ES may have an important role in the management of these patients.\r"

The amount of gastro-oesophageal reflux at pH monitoring decreased significantly and was less than the reflux in the normal subjects. The pressure and the intra-abdominal length of the distal oesophageal high-pressure zone increased significantly. The pressure was similar to that in the normal subjects while a significantly longer intra-abdominal part of the high-pressure zone was created. The clinical results of the operation were evaluated in 38 patients by an independent gastro-enterologist, and were considered to be excellent in 22 patients, good in 13, fair in 2 and poor in 1 patient. The antireflux procedure provided good control of the gastro-oesophageal reflux in our patients by restoring the major components of the antireflux mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Anal sensation has been assessed using a constant current stimulator in 21 patients after restorative proctocolectomy (15 J pouch, 6 W pouch). The anal transition zone (ATZ) has been excised in 15 patients but preserved in 6. Results were compared with 14 age- and sex-matched patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 14 controls. Median threshold values in the lower, mid and upper zones of the anal canal in pouch patients were: 6.8 mA, greater than 15.0 mA and greater than 15.0 mA respectively compared with 3.9 mA (P less than 0.01), 5.7 mA (P less than 0.01) and 11.4 mA (P less than 0.01) in UC and 3.5 mA (P less than 0.01), 4.2 mA (P less than 0.01) and 11.4 mA (P less than 0.01) in controls. The mid and upper zone threshold anal sensation was significantly lower when the ATZ had not been removed and except in the lower zone did not differ from UC or controls (median threshold sensations when ATZ was preserved were: lower zone, 5.8 mA; mid zone, 5.5 mA; upper zone, 7.5 mA). Paired studies in eight patients showed that excision of the ATZ was associated with a significant impairment in anal sensation (mid zone: 5.7 versus greater than 15.0 mA, P less than 0.05; upper zone: 7.5 versus greater than 15.0 mA, P less than 0.05) whereas no change in anal sensation was recorded when the ATZ was preserved. Despite these physiological changes, no clinical benefit could be identified in patients in whom the ATZ was preserved. Discrimination was normal in all except one patient. The incidence of soiling, nocturnal incontinence and failure to defer defaecation for more than 1 h was recorded in 3/15 patients (20 per cent) whose ATZ had been removed, compared with 1/6 patients (17 per cent) in whom the ATZ had been preserved. We conclude that excision of the ATZ does not eliminate the ability to discriminate and does not increase the risk of impaired continence after ileo-pouch anal anastomosis.\r"

The resected tissue was homogenized and incubated with purified factor X and calcium ions. The subsequent generation of activated factor X was measured spectrophotometrically with a chromogenic substrate. Results were expressed as absorbance units, and as the ratio of tumour and normal activities. Factor X-activating activity (FXAA) was present in all normal and malignant tissues tested. FXAA was significantly greater (P less than 0.001) in the tumour homogenates than in the uninvolved tissue. The tumour:normal ratio was significantly (greater than 1.2) elevated in 38 patients (76 per cent). FXAA was not correlated with the degree of differentiation of the tumour, the Dukes' classification of the disease or the exact site of the tumour. There was no difference between the FXAA content of non-involved tissue from the colorectal cancer group and colonic mucosa from patients with non-malignant bowel disease. It is concluded that colorectal carcinomas contain significantly more FXAA than adjacent, non-malignant colonic mucosa from the same subject, but there is no direct evidence for a relationship between procoagulant levels and the extent of malignancy in these patients.\r"

Its value in detecting oesophageal motility disorders was compared with oesophageal manometry in 102 symptomatic patients. Of 32 patients with normal OET, 22 (68.8 per cent) had normal manometry, whereas of 61 patients with abnormal manometry, 51 (84 per cent) had abnormal OET (chi 2 = 15.82, P less than 0.001). The computer-generated condensed image of the OET clearly defined five transit patterns: normal (n = 32); oscillatory (n = 21); non-clearance (n = 16); 'step' delay (n = 16) and non-specific delay (n = 17). The oscillatory pattern occurred in only one patient with normal manometry, but in all six with manometrically defined achalasia and two with diffuse oesophageal spasm. The predictive value of a positive (abnormal) OET test in detecting abnormal motility (both specific and non-specific disorders) was 73 per cent, and for specific motility disorders was 100 per cent. The predictive value of a negative (normal) test in excluding specific motor disorders was 94 per cent. Manometric tertiary contractions and low amplitude waves occurred in 6/32 and 1/32 patients with normal OET but in 31/70 and 21/70 with abnormal OET (chi 2 = 5.14, P less than 0.02; chi 2 = 7.85, P less than 0.001 respectively). Patients showing oscillation demonstrated significantly more tertiary contractions (17/21) and low amplitude waves (12/21) compared with 20/81 and 10/81 patients without oscillation (chi 2 = 20.47, P less than 0.001; chi 2 = 17.22, P less than 0.001 respectively). The solid bolus oesophageal transit test provides an objective screening test of specific oesophageal motility disorders and should be performed before oesophageal manometry.\r"

Under anaesthesia catheters were inserted into the gallbladder, common bile duct and duodenum, and electrodes were attached to the small intestine in five dogs. These animals were subsequently studied conscious and fasting. A double marker technique was used to measure bile acid output from the gallbladder and liver while pressure in the gallbladder and common bile duct and electrical activity in the small intestine were monitored. Four complete interdigestive cycles were recorded in each dog. Output of bile acids from the gallbladder fluctuated with the phases of the cycle: being lowest in phase I (3.9 +/- 0.7 mumol/min); increasing significantly (P less than 0.005) in phase II (9.8 +/- 1.0 mumol/min); remaining elevated in phase III (13.9 +/- 1.7 mumol/min); and falling significantly (P less than 0.05) in phase IV (8.4 +/- 1.8 mumol/min). In contrast, hepatic secretion of bile acids directly into the duodenum remained fairly constant. Intraluminal pressure in the biliary tract paralleled the fluctuation in gallbladder bile acid output, being significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in phases II and III. Periodic contraction of the gallbladder would, therefore, appear to be the principal mechanism for the phasic output of bile during fasting.\r"

The arterial disease in the aortotibial segment was documented by an abnormal brachial/ankle pressure index in 80 patients. An age-matched control group of elderly women (n = 30) with a normal pressure index was established. In the control group the mean serum TSH was 1.6 +/- 1.1 milliunits/l, median 1.5 milliunits/l and this established a normal range of 0.2-3.9 milliunits/l. Seven patients (8.8 per cent) were already receiving treatment for myxoedema. In the remaining patients, the overall distribution of serum TSH was skewed to higher levels; the mean was 3.7 milliunits/l, median 2.4 milliunits/l, P less than 0.001 compared with controls and 15 (19 per cent) had a serum TSH greater than 4 milliunits/l, compared with only one (3.3 per cent) of the controls. Therefore 22 patients (28 per cent) had myxoedema or a raised serum TSH. For all subjects with a normal TSH, there was a positive correlation of serum TSH with serum cholesterol, r = 0.68, P less than 0.001. For patients with a raised TSH, there was a continuing, but non-linear, increase of serum cholesterol with TSH. These results suggest that a raised serum TSH may be one of the risk factors for the development of peripheral arterial disease in women, possibly by increasing cholesterol levels.\r"

The patient had a marked impairment in visual object recognition along with good tactile object identification and a preserved ability to copy. Detailed investigations demonstrated impaired perceptual processes, with the patient's identification strongly affected by duration of stimulus exposure and by using overlapping figures. However, his stored knowledge of objects was shown to be intact. The results demonstrate that agnosia may be determined by a specific deficit in integrating form information; and that the input description for visual object recognition, disrupted in this patient, is functionally separate from stored object descriptions, which are intact. The implications of the results for understanding visual agnosia and for theories of normal visual object recognition are discussed.\r"

The main clinical feature was slowly evolving unilateral or bilateral facial numbness sometimes associated with pain and paraesthesiae and commonly with disturbed taste. Nine patients had either systemic sclerosis or mixed connective tissue disease. Of the 13 other patients, 9 had either organ or nonorgan specific serum autoantibodies. Blink reflex latencies were recorded in 17 patients, the commonest abnormality being an 'afferent' defect with modest prolongation of latency. Trigeminal sensory evoked responses were recorded in 14 cases, 6 showing mild prolongation of latencies. It is suggested that the lesion in this type of trigeminal neuropathy is in the trigeminal ganglion or in the proximal part of the main trigeminal divisions. This conclusion is supported by limited pathological data.\r"

He presented with a left homonymous hemianopia, tactile inattention, and dysphasia that quickly resolved, leaving a left-sided inattention and less marked dysphasia. Several language tasks and language-based imagery tasks revealed poor language processing of the left portion of words which could be remedied if the patient was instructed to do things like spell the word backwards. The overall results were consistent with the idea that some aspects of language processing involve spatial mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "88108769\r", 
  ".W": "It has previously been shown that, in normal subjects, heterotopic painful stimuli induce parallel decreases in the sensation of pain and the nociceptive spinal flexion reflex RIII simultaneously evoked by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve. By contrast, heterotopic non-noxious stimuli were ineffective in this respect. In order to assess the possible involvement of supraspinal structures in these changes, we have now compared the effects of nociceptive electrical stimuli applied to the fourth and fifth fingers of the hand on the contralateral RIII reflex in 5 normal subjects and 5 tetraplegic patients suffering from a clinically complete spinal cord transection of traumatic origin. The tetraplegic patient had a C5, C6 or C7 spinal cord transection with lower segments, notably C8 and T1, clinically uninjured. In these patients, sural nerve stimulation induced a biceps femoris reflex which did not differ from the RIII reflex recorded in normal subjects, either in terms of latency or of threshold. In both groups, the RIII reflex threshold was determined and a juxta-threshold RIII reflex was studied before, during and after a 2 min period of conditioning stimulation. The conditioning procedure consisted of nociceptive electrical stimulation applied to the digital branches of the ulnar nerve which arises from C8 and T1, i.e., below the level of the patients' spinal transection. In normal subjects such conditioning elicited painful sensations of 'pin prick', 'burning' and 'squeezing'. It simultaneously induced a strong inhibition of the RIII reflex which outlasted the conditioning period by several minutes. By contrast, non-nociceptive electrical conditioning stimuli (0.1 ms duration pulses of 6 to 8 mA intensity, at 3/s), similarly applied to the digital branches of the ulnar nerve were totally ineffective. In tetraplegic patients not only was the RIII reflex never decreased by the heterotopic nociceptive stimulation but it was, in fact, slightly enhanced. These results show that the effects of heterotopic nociceptive stimulation observed in normal man are possibly mediated by a complex loop involving supraspinal structures. This further underlines the similarity between this phenomenon and the Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls (DNIC) described in the rat, since the latter are observed in intact but not in spinal animals. These findings are discussed with reference to counter-irritation phenomena and procedures aimed at producing analgesia by somatic electrical stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The intraneural course of nerve fibres in the equine recurrent laryngeal nerve was investigated by partially ligating the nerve at a proximal site, and 3-8 weeks later, tracing the course and spatial relationships of intact and degenerating fibres along the distal stump. This nerve was chosen because of its great length, the fact that it is a nonbranching motor nerve and because of debate about the course of abductor and adductor nerve fibres in the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Six ponies were used and in each the recurrent nerve was partially ligatured about 20 cm from the larynx, using a fine silk suture. In all there was a clear separation of intact and degenerating fibres just distal to the suture, but they became mixed close to the point of innervation of the laryngeal muscles. The numbers of intact myelinated fibres remained similar along the partially denervated nerve segment. These results suggest that myelinated fibres mix within the recurrent laryngeal nerve and that focal lesions of this nerve should not result in denervation of individual laryngeal muscles.\r"
