  ".W": "Greater precision in the identification of seizure-initiating structures and preferential pathways of seizure spread has enabled us to classify complex partial seizures into subtypes. The mediobasal limbic subtype is the most important of these. Because of the paramount importance of amygdala and hippocampus in the majority of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, we initiated so-called \"selective\" amygdalo-hippocampectomy (AHE) as an alternative to conventional temporal lobectomy for the treatment of medically intractable mediobasal temporal lobe epilepsy. To date, 181 patients have been operated on using this microsurgical approach. Fifty-two of them had no detectable morphological lesion preoperatively. These were studied either by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) (n = 42) or using foramen-ovale (FO) electrodes (n = 10). Mean follow-up for this group was 47 (6-143) months. Sixty-two percent are seizure-free, 10% have only rare seizures, and worthwhile improvement occurred in another 15%. There was no improvement in 13%. Antiepileptic drugs have been discontinued in 21%; the remainder receive one or more drugs. Good postoperative seizure outcome related to the initial seizure-onset locus being exclusively within the resected structures. \"Palliative\" AHE is nevertheless an option in those cases in whom the primary focus lies in or close to indispensable neocortex (e.g., speech area) and in whom a secondary pacemaker role of the amygdala-hippocampus complex has been demonstrated. Further factors influencing outcome include the presence of structural abnormality (especially of hippocampal sclerosis), age at seizure onset, preoperative duration of seizures, and postoperative EEG findings. In patients with a good seizure outcome, learning and memory performance increased, especially for material specific for the nonoperated hemisphere. We conclude that temporal lobe epilepsy with mediobasal limbic seizures is preferably treated surgically by selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy rather than \"standard\" temporal lobectomy.\r"

As targets, they may be charged with negligent failure to diagnose, treat, or inform about epilepsy or its associated problems, with failure to exercise due care in protecting persons harmed by their patients, or with failure to preserve confidentiality of medical information. Although legislation and judicial decisions have defined some of the physician's legal duties with reasonable clarity, areas of uncertainty remain, particularly regarding the issue of violating medical confidentiality for the benefit of persons other than the patient.\r"

Numerous biochemical and electrophysiological processes have been shown to be modulated by anticonvulsant drugs. However, clear correlations of these effects with anticonvulsant activity are often difficult to determine. Over the last 5 years, several major research areas have developed that shed new light on the mechanisms of action of anticonvulsant drugs. Although a complete discussion of all aspects of anticonvulsant research are not possible in the scope of this article, a description of benzodiazepine receptors, mechanisms involved in neuronal sustaining repetitive firing, and calcium regulation of neuronal function have direct bearing on neuronal excitability and ultimately on anticonvulsant drug effect. Each of these major research areas has opened new insights into our understanding of molecular mechanisms of how anticonvulsant drugs work.\r"

  ".U": "89004986\r", 
  ".W": "Intraoperative cortical stimulation for evaluation of cortical function has been used extensively to define the extent of cortical excisions for surgical treatment of epilepsy. With chronic implantation of subdural electrodes, extraoperative cortical stimulation becomes possible, and these favorable testing conditions permit more precise mapping of the cortex. This assists the surgeon in planning details of the surgical removal and also provides additional data about the function of the human cortex. Four aspects in which detailed extraoperative studies have provided information complementing the pioneer studies of Foerster, Penfield, and others will be discussed here: (1) Frontal eye field: In the human, this is always an integral part of the motor strip (most probably located in Brodman's area 4 and/or 6) and elicits only conjugate eye movements to the contralateral side with a variable upward component. (2) Negative motor area: Stimulation of the inferior frontal gyrus immediately in front of the face area and of the supplementary motor area of the dominant and nondominant hemisphere produces \"inhibition\" of voluntary fine movements. (3) The movement related potentials (bereitschaftpotential, negative slope, and motor potential) are strictly localized to the portion of the sensorimotor strip where the movement is represented. Lower amplitude bereitschaftpotentials can also be detected in the homotopic ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and in the supplementary motor cortex. (4) Three language areas can be distinguished by electrical stimulation: Broca's, Wernicke's, and the basal temporal language area. Electrical stimulation in all these areas produces a similar deficit, but Broca's area tends to overlap with the inferior frontal negative motor area. This may explain the predominant motor deficit of Broca's aphasia.\r"

Although it is commonly perceived that patients with epilepsy experience problems with seizure control if they use alcohol, this is not confirmed by the few experimental studies that have tested the hypothesis. The last 30 years have emphasized the role of withdrawal from alcohol as a mechanism of seizure production. However, this is but one of many potential mechanisms by which seizures and epilepsy may be related to alcohol use and abuse. The rare but clear situations in which alcohol can act as a convulsant drug need further study, and mechanisms by which the long-term neurotoxic effects of alcohol lead to chronic epilepsy also need further elucidation.\r"

Noncompliance negates the usefulness of the advances made in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy and is perhaps the single most important factor in increasing the costs of care for people with epilepsy. Although the issue of noncompliance is very complex, realization that it is a multidimensional problem and varies from patient to patient should help individualize its evaluation and approach. Noncompliance can be described by three dimensions: behavior, extent, and intentionality. The simplest methods for determining noncompliance are measurements of the antiepileptic drug concentration and patient interview. Calculation of a coefficient of variation for serial anticonvulsant drug levels may be more descriptive, however. Education and devices to simplify dosing are the primary strategies for improving compliance.\r"

  ".W": "Corpus callosum section for carefully selected patients with uncontrolled epilepsy has become more acceptable as operative complications have decreased. From consideration of anatomical pathways utilized in the spread of seizure discharges, section of the corpus callosum is expected to decrease, but not abolish, bilaterally synchronous EEG abnormalities arising from most cerebral locations, perhaps excluding the temporal lobe. Clinical experience confirms this expectation. Persistence of some bilateral synchrony, presumably through subcortical relays, does not usually diminish the effectiveness of corpus callosum section on clinically generalized seizures that are eliminated or markedly decreased in 85% of patients after total corpus callosum section. Generalized seizure types that respond include tonic, atonic, tonic-clonic, and absence seizures. Patients who continue to have generalized seizures usually have low IQ and perhaps extensive bilateral cerebral involvement increases the extent to which subcortical structures participate in generalization. Complex partial seizures may cease, usually in patients with well-circumscribed, often extratemporal seizure foci. Focal seizures intensify in 25% of patients; a predictable consequence of sectioning interhemispheric inhibitory connections. Permanent disconnection syndromes, which are only rarely symptomatic, include sensory disconnection after posterior section, and split-brain syndrome after total section. A small percentage of patients develop impairments in language, motor, or memory functions. Language and motor deficits are predicted by pre-existing unilateral mild or moderate central nervous system damage. Partial section of the corpus callosum produces control of generalized seizures half as frequently as complete section. Neurologic sequelae of partial section occur nearly as frequently but are less severe.\r"

Compared to those from the NF group, granulosa cells from the greater than two-cell group secreted less progesterone (P) in vitro and had a fourfold increase in percentage of cells with internalized hCG. These results demonstrate that the steroidogenic capacity of granulosa cells from follicles whose oocytes fertilize and undergo accelerated embryonic development in vitro differs from the capacity of granulosa cells from NF follicles. This difference may be due to their enhanced ability to bind and subsequently internalize hCG.\r"

Exposure of the oviduct to endometriosis PF reduced fimbrial activity of ovum capture and developed an OCI-related membrane on the fimbria, by which fimbrial cilia were completely concealed. This was not the case for nonendometriosis PF. Subsequently, an oviduct having been exposed to endometriosis PF was retrogradely flushed, by which the OCI-related membrane was ballooned and removed. The flushed oviduct resumed its activity of ovum capture.

Intensely labeled epithelial cells were distributed along surfaces of villi surrounding follicles in jejunal and ileal Peyer's patches and along interdomal epithelium in sacculus rotundus and appendix. Secretory component labeling extended from within crypts and appendiceal crevices to the tips of villi and interdomal regions. In contrast, no immunologically detectable secretory component sites were observed in follicle-associated epithelial cells. In crypts and crevices supplying follicles, epithelial cells facing the lamina propria of villi and interdomal epithelium expressed secretory component, but cells flanking the follicle domes lacked secretory component immunostaining, with a clear demarcation between positive and negative zones at the base of the stem cell regions. These findings demonstrate a unique difference in the expression of the receptor for immunoglobulin A antibody between follicle-associated and non-follicle-associated epithelium.\r"

Antral C. pylori, found in 9 of 23 biopsy specimens (3 of 11 controls, 6 of 12 indomethacin-treated patients; not significantly different), correlated strongly with histologic evidence of active superficial antral gastritis (p less than 0.005), but not with the endoscopic appearance of the antrum. In contrast to the antrum, fundic C. pylori, found in 14 of 23 biopsy specimens (61%), were frequently associated with histologically and endoscopically normal fundic mucosa. Campylobacter pylori-associated active antral gastritis occurred only in subjects whose fundus harbored this organism. Plasma immunoglobulin G antibody titers to C. pylori were highest in subjects with Campylobacter-associated antral gastritis and lowest in subjects without gastric Campylobacter. These studies suggest that healthy humans may harbor C. pylori in their proximal stomach without apparent ill effects. In some of these individuals, the organism also involves the antrum and is associated with active gastritis.\r"

Removal of Na+ and HCO3- or addition of amiloride or 4-acetamido-4-isothiocyanostillbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (blockers of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3-exchangers) had no influence on steady-state pHi, suggesting that these ion exchangers do not significantly contribute to the maintenance of pHi in the presence of normal external pH. Acidification of mucosal (luminal) perfusate to pH 3 (mimicking the presence of gastric acid) had no influence on pHi, but mucosal pH 2 (10 mM HCl) acidified pHi to 6.93 +/- 0.07. Acidification of serosal (nutrient) perfusate to pH 6 (mimicking intramucosal acidosis caused by back-diffusion of luminal H+) acidified pHi to 6.72 +/- 0.10. Removal of Na+ from and addition of amiloride to the serosal perfusate during exposure to serosal pH 6.0 induced further acidification of pHi, suggesting that in this acidotic situation (with very low ambient HCO3- concentration) a Na+/H+ exchanger does contribute to the maintenance of steady-state pHi. Increased PCO2 (10% vol/vol in the gas) in a slightly acidic milieu (mimicking mucosal ischemia) likewise acidified pHi to 6.73 +/- 0.05. A combination of mucosal acid (pH 3), high PCO2 (10% CO2), and low serosal pH (pH 6) (mimicking conditions that prevail, for example, during hemorrhagic shock) acidified pHi and ultimately resulted in cell death. These derangements of intracellular acid-base balance may have pathogenetic importance also in in vivo stress ulceration.\r"

We studied gastric emptying of solids in 9 adult obese subjects on 2 separate days in a randomized fashion. On day 1, 15 g of pectin was added to the meal, and on day 2 15 g of methylcellulose was added and served as control. Satiety was evaluated by an analogue rating scale. Pectin significantly delayed gastric emptying time [t1/2 = 116 +/- 23 min vs. 71 +/- 17 min observed with methylcellulose (p less than 0.001)]. Pectin also significantly increased subjects' sensation of satiety [98 +/- 7 vs. 74 +/- 17 (p less than 0.001)]. Postprandial release of cholecystokinin and pancreatic polypeptide was not modified by pectin. As pectin induces satiety and delays gastric emptying in obese patients, it may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of disorders of overeating.\r"

Vagal stimulation also increased the release of the neuropeptide gastrin-releasing peptide to the venous effluent from 0.42 +/- 0.12 to 3.1 +/- 0.95 pmol/min. Intravascular infusions of gastrin-releasing peptide at a concentration of 10(-8) mol/L resulted in a threefold increase in pepsinogen secretion and a small increase in acid output. Because gastrin-mediated effects of gastrin-releasing peptide are excluded with this preparation, our results show that gastrin-releasing peptide acts either directly or through another unknown local mediator on the pepsinogen-secreting cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide may thus participate in the vagal control of pepsinogen secretion.\r"

It is shown unambiguously that lipase activity occurs only in the fundic mucosa of the stomach, whereas no significant activity takes place in the antral, pharyngeal, or lingual areas, including the circumvallate papillae. In adults, the potential activity of human gastric lipase, as measured using tributyrin as substrate, amounts to 20% of its pancreatic counterpart. Lipase activity was also determined on human gastric biopsy samples taken during gastrofibroscopy tests on healthy adults. These results confirmed the finding that a lipolytic activity of gastric origin occurs uniformly and only in the fundic mucosa. Triacylglycerol hydrolysis is associated with a genuine gastric lipase activity that is clearly distinct from the classical esterase observed using p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate. Lipase activity decreases significantly with age: it ranges on average from 4700 U/g of fresh mucosa in subjects aged up to 50 yr to 700 U/g of fresh mucosa in persons over 60 yr of age.\r"

Ethanol increased histamine release by the jejunum both in vivo (p less than 0.01) and in vitro (p less than 0.05). To investigate the effect of antihistamines on ethanol-induced plasma protein loss, we determined the dose of blockers that would completely inhibit the histamine1 and histamine2 receptors. In the absence of antihistamines, ethanol caused a 10-fold increase in jejunal protein loss over the controls (p less than 0.001). Simultaneous inhibition of histamine1 and histamine2 receptors attenuated (p less than 0.025), but did not abolish, the ethanol-induced protein loss. These data are discussed in relation to the literature, and it is concluded that histamine may play a role in the jejunal microvascular effects of ethanol. As the ethanol-induced protein loss was not completely inhibited, other mediators or mechanisms were probably involved.\r"

  ".W": "Desferrioxamine (DFO) is an iron chelating agent that, when administered orally, interferes with gut absorption of inorganic iron and, when administered parenterally, binds body iron and is excreted as ferrioxamine in bile and urine. Studies were carried out in normal and iron-deficient male rats and in normal, iron-replete male volunteers to investigate the blocking action of parenteral DFO on the absorption of radioiron. Radiolabeled ferrous ammonium sulfate, transferrin iron, or hemoglobin iron was injected directly into the jejunum of rats with or without intramuscular injections of DFO. Radioiron administered as ferrous sulfate or as transferrin iron was given to the volunteers by mouth or by direct duodenal infusion, respectively, with or without intravenous infusions of DFO. In iron-deficient rats, intramuscular DFO injections commencing 1 h before direct jejunal injection of radioiron significantly blocked absorption of inorganic iron (26% with DFO, 64% without DFO), transferrin iron (4% with DFO, 69% without DFO), and hemoglobin iron (3% with DFO, 19% without DFO). In normal rats, DFO injections also significantly blocked absorption of inorganic iron and transferrin iron. In normal volunteers, intravenous DFO infusions commencing 1 h before administration of radioiron significantly blocked absorption of physiologic doses of inorganic iron (3% with DFO, 21% without DFO) and transferrin iron (1% with DFO, 20% without DFO). The quantity of radioiron excreted in urine by both rats and humans with administration of DFO did not account for the observed decrement in absorption of radioiron. Biochemical analysis of rat intestinal mucosal scrapings after injection of DFO and administration of radioiron demonstrated the accumulation of a small molecular weight fraction containing iron that was ferrioxamine (iron-chelate) complex. We conclude that parenterally administered DFO can enter the small intestinal mucosa, bind intracellular iron, and block iron absorption. Parenteral DFO blocks the absorption of inorganic iron, transferrin iron, and hemoglobin iron, suggesting that all three iron species enter a common chelatable pool within the small intestinal mucosa and may share a common pathway of absorption.\r"

  ".W": "The small intestinal motor effects of fractionated doses of ionizing radiation were studied in 6 conscious dogs. Eight strain-gauge transducers were implanted on the small intestine and a single gauge on the ascending colon, of each dog. After control recordings, an abdominal dose of 250 cGy was administered three times a week on alternate days for 3 successive weeks (total dose, 2250 cGy). Recordings were then made for 4 wk of follow-up. Giant migrating contractions occurred 11 times in 520 h of control recordings in the fasted and fed state, with a mean distance of origin of 55 +/- 16 cm from the ileocolonic junction. Abdominal field irradiation significantly increased the incidence and distance of origin of these giant contractions to 438 in 745 recording hours and 158 +/- 7 cm from the ileocolonic junction, respectively. The incidence of giant migrating contractions peaked after the second dose of radiation. The amplitude ratio of radiation-induced giant migrating contractions to phase III contractions, and their duration and velocity of migration, were similar to the control state. The dogs developed diarrhea and vomiting as early as the first fraction of radiation. Irradiation also increased the incidence of retrograde giant contractions from 8 in 520 h of control recording to 42 in 745 h of recording during the radiation schedule. The radiation-induced retrograde giant contractions peaked in incidence on the day of the first fraction of radiation and were more likely to be associated with a vomiting episode than those occurring in the control period. Migrating motor complex cycling persisted during radiation and its cycle length was not different from the control or postradiation values. Our findings suggest that some of the side effects of radiation such as diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting may be related to the dramatically increased incidence of giant migrating contractions and retrograde giant contractions.\r"

We performed studies in rabbits to assess the usefulness of this technique for selectively coagulating the colonic vasculature. By measuring the optical absorbance of rabbit colon with a spectrophotometer, it was determined that hemoglobin exhibits strong absorption relative to the rabbit colon at a wavelength of 577 nm. Because light must be absorbed to affect tissue, it was hypothesized that laser pulses of this wavelength would selectively damage blood vessels. This hypothesis was tested by examining the effect of 300-microseconds-long 577-nm laser pulses on rabbit colon in vivo. For delivered radiant exposures between 4 and 8 J/cm2, selective coagulation of the colonic vasculature could be produced without damage to the surrounding colon. At greater radiant exposures, vessel hemorrhage was occasionally noted but no transmural thermal injury was produced with delivered radiant exposures as high as 22 J/cm2. This technique may form the basis of a safe and simple treatment of vascular lesions of the colon such as angiodysplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The role of central (supraspinal and spinal) and peripheral alpha-adrenoceptors in the regulation of gastrointestinal propulsion in the mouse was studied using clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. Clonidine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of propulsion when given intracerebroventricularly, intrathecally, or subcutaneously, but was most potent when given intracerebroventricularly. The antitransit effects of centrally given clonidine were antagonized by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) yohimbine, but higher doses were required when this antagonist was given peripherally. Whereas i.c.v. and s.c. administration of clonidine were effective in inhibiting gut transit in spinally transected mice, intrathecal (i.th.) administration of this agonist was not. A supraspinal site of clonidine action is suggested based upon (a) the higher central to peripheral potency of clonidine; (b) the greater potency of i.c.v., compared with s.c., administration of yohimbine in blocking i.c.v. clonidine; (c) the lack of effect of i.th. administration of clonidine in spinally transected mice; and (d) the reduced potency of i.c.v., but not s.c., administration of clonidine in spinally transected mice. Additionally, a peripheral site of clonidine action is suggested by (a) the lower potency of i.c.v. yohimbine in blocking s.c., compared with i.c.v., clonidine; (b) the lower potency of i.c.v. yohimbine in blocking i.c.v. clonidine in transected mice (compared with normal mice); (c) the equal potency of s.c. clonidine in slowing propulsion in normal and spinally transected mice; and (d) the equal potency of i.c.v. yohimbine in blocking s.c. clonidine in normal and spinally transected mice. These data in mice would thus support the concept that normal (peripheral) therapeutic administration of clonidine would affect gut motor function by interactions within the brain and directly at the level of the gut.\r"

Everted jejunal gut sacs prepared from rat intestine were incubated with labeled fragments. After incubation, fluid exposed to the serosal surface was applied to a Sephadex G-50 gel permeation column. Radioactivity was detected in fractions corresponding to the elution position of the fragments. Transfer of fragments from the mucosal to the serosal surface was temperature-dependent. In in vivo studies, labeled fragments were infused into the jejunum of rats. Blood samples obtained from a mesenteric vein or the portal vein contained labeled fragments. After infusion of unlabeled fragments, nanogram amounts of immunoreactive fragments were detected by radioimmunoassay of mesenteric and portal venous blood. Thus, polypeptide fragments of a potential food protein were capable of being transferred across the mucosa in vitro and in vivo. Failure to detect fragments in the systemic circulation most likely results from their rapid clearance.\r"

Five of 7 patients had dilated small bowel with 4 of them showing slow transit of barium; 2 of 7 patients had dilated colons; and 3 of 7 patients had slow colonic transit. Five patients died 4-9 mo after onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, and 2 survived. Post-mortem or surgical samples of the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon showed neuron and axon degeneration and dropout, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, and glial cell proliferation within the myenteric plexus of 6 patients.

Neuron numbers were significantly less than normal in each area of the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, we conclude that lung cancer may be complicated by severe gastrointestinal motor dysfunction resulting from visceral neuropathy of the myenteric plexus, a paraneoplastic effect of the cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Using a novel labeling technique with technetium 99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine, we studied 29 patients with known or suspected Crohn's disease. Technetium 99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine leukocyte scanning (99mTc scan) was prospectively compared with the results of independently performed radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic examinations, and with findings at surgery, to assess the clinical usefulness of this technique to localize inflammatory lesions. In addition, uptake of technetium 99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine in the bowel was graded by comparing it with the uptake in liver and bone marrow and correlating this with established parameters of disease activity. The viability of homologous labeled leukocytes was greater than 95%. Less than 5% of lymphocytes were found in the final preparation. It was found that 45% +/- 12% of the label was bound to granulocytes, and 98% of the unbound label was washed off before reinjection. The results of 99mTc scan revealed a good correlation with those of barium enema (r = 0.880, p less than 0.001), of endoscopy/surgery (r = 0.983, p less than 0.001), and of all combined reference methods (r = 0.981, p less than 0.001). Activity as determined by 99mTc scan was weakly correlated with the results of Crohn's disease activity index (r = 0.559, p less than 0.01), van Hees index (r = 0.606, p less than 0.01), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.456, p less than 0.05) in 24 patients with proven Crohn's disease. The correlation was improved when the 99mTc scan was compared with a combination of these activity parameters and C-reactive protein (r = 0.781, p less than 0.001). Extraintestinal manifestations (joints) and complications (cholecystitis) were also identified correctly by the 99mTc scan. The study demonstrates that leukocyte scanning with technetium 99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine as a label can reliably assess the location and, to a lesser degree, activity of Crohn's disease. This technique is more convenient and provides images far superior to those produced by indium 111-labeled leukocyte scanning.\r"

  ".U": "89006130\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory have characterized the transport process of biotin across the brush border membrane and the basolateral membrane of the human intestine. In this study we further characterized biotin transport in the human intestine by examining the vitamin's transport process in different areas of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) and the effect of pH on the transport process using a brush border membrane vesicle technique. In all areas examined, the transport of biotin as a function of concentration was saturable in the presence of a Na+ gradient (out greater than in) but was linear and lower in the presence of a choline gradient (out greater than in). Transport of biotin by the Na+-dependent process (i.e., the carrier-mediated process) was found to be higher in the duodenum than the jejunum, which was in turn higher than that in the ileum. This decrease in biotin transport distally was found to be due to a decrease in the Vmax of the transport process of the vitamin with no changes in the apparent Km. This indicates that the number (i.e., the density) of transport carriers for biotin decreases distally. In the presence of a Na+ gradient (out greater than in), decreasing incubation buffer pH from 8.0 to 5.5 (intravesicular pH was 7.4) was found to cause an increase in biotin transport. This increase was found to be due to the acidic buffer pH (i.e., not due to the pH gradient imposed across the membrane) and occurred through an increase in the transport of the vitamin by the nonmediated process. These results demonstrate that the proximal part of the small intestine is the site of maximum transport of biotin in humans. Furthermore, variation in incubation medium pH affects biotin transport through changes in the substrate transport by the nonmediated process.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of gastric emptying of nutrients on plasma cholecystokinin and pancreatobiliary functions is poorly understood. We therefore temporally related the emptying of fat, protein, and glucose of a mixed meal to release of the gut hormones cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, and peptide YY and outputs of trypsin, lipase, bilirubin, and bile salts. Five healthy volunteers with a multilumen duodenal tube ingested a mixed meal with phase-specific markers for the aqueous phase, liquid fat, solid fat, and solid protein phases. Duodenal passage was determined by intraduodenal infusion of a second set of phase-specific nonabsorbable markers. Plasma cholecystokinin levels and pancreatobiliary secretions rose to a maximum at 30-60 min and then gradually declined (p less than 0.01) despite continued entry of protein and fat into the duodenum throughout the whole 4-h experimental period. High levels of both pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY were observed in the last 2 h of the experiment. Release of factors capable of inhibiting cholecystokinin release and subsequently pancreatobiliary secretion may be responsible for the observed time-course.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether daily administration of cyclosporin A to symptomatic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for 1 yr would lead to a significant and sustained improvement in liver enzyme abnormalities. Twelve adult patients (11 female, 1 male; aged 52.6 +/- 8.9 yr, mean +/- SD) with serologic and histologically defined primary biliary cirrhosis were randomized to receive either oral cyclosporin A or vehicle placebo. Cyclosporin A was administered at sufficient dosages to maintain serum radioimmunoassay trough levels between 100 and 200 ng/ml (starting dosage, 2.5 mg/kg.day). After 1 yr of therapy, significant changes from pretreatment values were seen only in recipients of cyclosporin A. These included a 37% decrease in mean serum alkaline phosphatase and a 43% decrease in gamma-glutamyltransferase (controls +3% and -14%, respectively). Mean serum bilirubin and albumin levels and prothrombin times remained unaltered in the two groups, as did the extent of inflammation and fibrosis and the histologic staging of liver biopsy specimens. Although mean serum creatinine levels increased by 51% in recipients of cyclosporin A (+2% in controls), there were no associated changes in diastolic blood pressure or creatinine clearance values. Other side effects including thrombocytopenia, hirsutism, headaches, tremor, and parasthesiae were common in the treated group but not of sufficient severity to warrant adjustment in the dosage or discontinuation of therapy. The observed changes in hepatic, renal, and hematologic tests tended to return to baseline after discontinuation of therapy. Two patients, both placebo recipients, died of liver failure during the study period. The results of this study indicate that in symptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis, cyclosporin A administration is associated with a significant improvement in cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities that persists for the duration of therapy. A progressive rise in serum creatinine levels and a high incidence of side effects raise concerns regarding the long-term safety of this agent in primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

Randomly scattered single infected hepatocytes were first seen on days 1 and 2 after inoculation and by day 3 occurred as single cells, pairs, and groups of 5-10 adjoining cells. From day 4 after inoculation all hepatocytes were positive for duck hepatitis B surface antigen and deoxyribonucleic acid. Duck hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels in liver extracts and serum increased logarithmically from days 2 to 3 to a plateau by days 4 to 5 after inoculation. Infected and control birds showed no significant differences during the first 7 days in terms of liver histology, hepatocyte morphology, or mitotic activity. It was concluded that (a) virus gains access to randomly distributed hepatocytes without first replicating in other cell types, and then begins disseminating to adjacent cells following anatomic boundaries; (b) markers of infection in liver and serum show reproducible kinetics, thus making this in vivo system amenable to further quantitative study; and (c) hepatocytes in this system are highly permissive to virus replication without the development of significant cytopathology.\r"

The jejunal conduit also served as an access for periodic removal of newly formed stones. This combined surgical and radiologic approach is an effective way of removing recurring pigment stones. The afferent jejunal limb can also be used to perfuse dissolution agents, if necessary, via catheters placed in the biliary tree.\r"

The enzyme activity remained normal during follow-up in 7 cases and fluctuated in 5 cases (it returned to normal in 4). The presence of advanced histologic stage (fibrosis/cirrhosis) with marked cholangiographic changes in 4 patients establishes that cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis can occur without a concomitant increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity. Therefore, primary sclerosing cholangitis may exist in an occult state without symptoms or increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity. Our findings suggest that primary sclerosing cholangitis may be more prevalent than realized, especially in patients who have inflammatory bowel disease. A normal value for serum alkaline phosphatase activity should not preclude further investigation for primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease when symptoms or signs suggest liver disease.\r"

We report the case of a 67-yr-old man with a 32-yr history of idiopathic hemochromatosis complicated by cirrhosis, who had reversal of cirrhosis with phlebotomy therapy, yet developed hepatocellular carcinoma.

Patients were found to have discrete or confluent white plaques adherent to the colonic mucosa, mild to severe erythema of the surrounding mucosa, and variable amounts of foamy liquid upon withdrawal of the endoscope. Stool assays for Clostridium difficile toxin and bacterial cultures were negative. Mucosal biopsies revealed vacuolar changes in the lamina propria, with slight to moderate vascular congestion and foci of intramucosal hemorrhage. Five patients developed rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and increased frequency of stools, lasting up to 12 days. We believe these cases were due to contamination of the endoscope's air-water channel with solutions used during endoscope cleaning. Recognition of this entity is important, as it is preventable and may mimic pseudomembranous colitis.\r"

  ".W": "Studies that have examined the cardiopulmonary receptor control of circulation in hypertension have produced conflicting results. In 10 normotensive subjects and in age-matched essential hypertensive subjects without (n = 10) or with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 12), as well as in seven subjects of the latter group restudied after 1 year of treatment that induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy, we examined the cardiopulmonary reflex by increasing central venous pressure and stimulating cardiopulmonary receptors through passive leg raising and by reducing central venous pressure and deactivating cardiopulmonary receptors through nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure. Reflex responses were measured as changes in forearm vascular resistance (mean blood pressure divided by plethysmographically measured blood flow), plasma norepinephrine concentration, and plasma renin activity. In hypertensive subjects without left ventricular hypertrophy, stimulation and deactivation of cardiopulmonary receptors caused changes in forearm vascular resistance, norepinephrine concentration, and plasma renin activity that were modestly reduced as compared with those in normotensive subjects. However, all these changes were markedly reduced in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy. Following regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, the changes in vascular resistance, plasma norepinephrine, and plasma renin activity induced by cardiopulmonary receptor manipulation all improved markedly. These results demonstrate that cardiopulmonary receptor regulation of peripheral vascular resistance and of neurohumoral variables is impaired in essential hypertension and that the impairment is much more pronounced when this condition is associated with cardiac structural alterations. Therapeutic regression of these alterations, however, leads to a marked improvement of this reflex, with consequent favorable effects on circulatory homeostasis.\r"

Recently, the dipyridamole-echocardiography test (two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring with dipyridamole infusion, up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) has been proposed as an exercise-independent method for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The diagnostic usefulness of the exercise-electrocardiography test and the dipyridamole-echocardiography test was evaluated in 63 consecutive inpatients with history of chest pain, essential hypertension, and no previous myocardial infarction. The criterion of positivity for the exercise-electrocardiography test was a horizontal or downsloping ST segment shift exceeding 0.1 mV and for the dipyridamole-echocardiography test, a transient dyssynergy of contraction. Fifteen patients could not perform a diagnostic exercise-electrocardiography test because of an inability to exercise adequately (two patients), severe hypertension in spite of full antihypertensive therapy (six patients), or excessive blood pressure rise at the first step of the exercise-electrocardiography test (seven patients). Five patients could not perform the dipyridamole-echocardiography test because of a poor acoustic window. The overall feasibility was 76% for the exercise-electrocardiography test and 92% for the dipyridamole-echocardiography test (p less than 0.05). All 43 patients who performed both tests underwent coronary angiography; 30 had significant coronary artery disease (greater than 70% lumen reduction of at least 1 major coronary vessel). Sensitivity was 67% for both the exercise-electrocardiography test and the dipyridamole-echocardiography test (p = NS); specificity was 46% for the exercise-electrocardiography test and 92% for the dipyridamole-echocardiography test (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systolic blood pressure measured by tail cuff started to increase in both sinoaortic-denervated and sham-operated rats 7 days after DOCA treatment, and the hypertension developed identically in both denervated and sham-operated rats. These findings suggest that the baroreceptor reflex cannot act against the development of hypertension. To determine whether the baroreceptor reflex is attenuated before the development of hypertension, bradycardiac and sympathoinhibitory responses to i.v. injections of norepinephrine were examined. Bradycardic and sympathoinhibitory responses were significantly smaller in DOCA-salt-treated rats in both prehypertensive (5th day after DOCA-salt treatment) and hypertensive stages (21st day after treatment). In urethane-anesthetized DOCA-loaded and control rats on the 5th day after treatment, aortic depressor nerve stimulation elicited frequency-dependent depressor and bradycardic responses accompanied by inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity in both DOCA-loaded and control rats. However, those responses were significantly smaller in DOCA-loaded rats than in control rats. These results suggest that the central component of the baroreceptor reflex mediated by the aortic depressor nerve is impaired before hypertension develops and that this impairment may contribute to the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt-treated rats.\r"

Treatment of erythrocytes of healthy donors with protein kinase C activator (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) leads to similar but more marked changes in cell shape (17% of cup-shaped forms), volume reduction (by 7%), an increase of Band 4.9 protein phosphorylation (threefold), and an increase in the rate of Na+-H+ exchange (fourfold). Protein kinase activation does not modify Na+-Li+ exchange and slightly increases (by 20-50%) Na+-K+ pump activity, Na+-K+ cotransport, and the rate of 45Ca influx. It may be assumed that the increase of protein kinase C activity is one of the most probable molecular mechanisms conditioning abnormalities of the membrane skeleton and Na+-H+ exchange in primary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the contribution of changes in the synthesis or degradation (or both) of renal eicosanoids to the alterations in renal hemodynamics observed in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were markedly reduced in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with values observed in control rats given water or saline to drink. The abnormalities in renal hemodynamics in the hypertensive rats were associated with an increase in the excretion of thromboxane B2, an increase in the release of thromboxane B2 from renal cortical tissue slices, and a diminished release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from renal medullary tissue. Additionally, the urinary excretion of PGE2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and the release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from renal cortical and medullary tissue were elevated in rats with DOCA-salt hypertension. Since the excretion of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and the release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha by medullary tissue were also elevated in normotensive rats given 1% NaCl solution to drink, these latter changes probably were related to an elevation of sodium intake rather than to the development of hypertension. The functional significance of the alterations in the renal production of thromboxane in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was evaluated by comparing the effects of a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and a receptor antagonist on renal function in normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. The administration of the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor furegrelate and the thromboxane receptor blocker SQ 29548 had no effect on renal hemodynamics in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Direct (femoral artery) mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, cardiac output/body weight ratio (as defined by M-mode echocardiography), and total peripheral vascular resistance were measured and calculated every 2 months in nine conscious dogs during development from 2 to 10 months of age. In four dogs a J-shaped catheter for atrial pacing was chronically implanted at the age of 3 months, and their hearts were permanently paced at 130 beats/min until maturity. The aim of atrial pacing was to prevent the natural slowing of the heart rate and, consequently, to maintain a cardiac output/body weight ratio that was inappropriately high in relation to age during growth. Five dogs were studied as controls. No hemodynamic differences were observed until the age of 4 months. From the age of 5 to 10 months heart rate was kept at 130 beats/min by atrial pacing in the atrially paced group, and the mean cardiac output/body weight ratio did not decrease (196 +/- 24 vs 191 +/- 34 [SE] ml/min/kg). MAP rose from 62 +/- 4 to 116 +/- 8 mm Hg, and total peripheral resistance increased from 0.34 +/- 0.07 to to 0.61 +/- 0.09 mm Hg/ml/min/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypertension was produced in two-kidney dogs by unilateral renal artery constriction. After 3 months, the compromised kidney was removed in half of the dogs. Mean arterial pressure was significantly elevated in the hypertensive dogs after 3 months (127 +/- 2 vs 94 +/- 1 mm Hg for controls) and partially returned toward normal 3 months after nephrectomy (105 +/- 2 mm Hg). Pressure-diameter relations were determined under conditions of maximum active and passive smooth muscle activation. Contiguous segments were used for the determination of water and connective tissue content. Hypertension was associated with increased passive arterial wall stiffness at most sites, with a partial return toward normal after nephrectomy. Maximum responses to smooth muscle activation (active stress and constriction response) were augmented in arteries from hypertensive dogs and partially returned toward normal in the nephrectomized hypertensive group. The elastin content of these arteries was unchanged, while collagen content was nonuniformly decreased in renal hypertensive dogs. Small decreases were found in the radius-wall thickness ratio of some arteries. No significant mechanical changes occurred in the saphenous artery. The largest hypertension-related changes were found in the coronary arteries, which also exhibited the smallest recovery toward normal properties after nephrectomy. Considerable regional variability of changes in arterial wall in renal hypertensive and nephrectomized hypertensive dogs was found. Incomplete resolution of the hypertension and arterial wall changes by nephrectomy was found in this animal model.\r"

We tested the possibility that the conflicting results might be breeder-related by measuring 1) the rate of intestinal mucosal calcium transport, 2) the concentration of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and 1,25-(OH)2D, and 3) the concentration of intestinal mucosal receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D in the two strains of animals from three different breeders. Sodium and water transport were also measured because of their relevance to hypertension. Blood pressure was always higher and calcium, as well as mean sodium and water transport, was always lower in the SHR than in the WKY. The concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D was the same, higher, or lower in the SHR than in the WKY and was age- and breeder-dependent. Mean mucosal 1,25-(OH)2D receptor concentration was higher in the SHR and was variable, depending on breeder. We conclude that 1) the rate of calcium transport is lower in the SHR than in the WKY and independent of breeder and concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D in serum, 2) the variability in 1,25-(OH)2D concentration among investigators may be breeder-dependent, and 3) the higher receptor concentration in the intestinal mucosa of the SHR could be a compensatory response to the decreased rate of calcium transport. These differences in calcium and sodium transport may be an expression in the enterocyte of factors etiological for hypertension.\r"

The same hamster cheek pouch microvessels were tested for angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II) reactivity before and 10 to 14 days after Grollman (two-kidney, one figure-8) or sham operation. Microvascular geometric parameters were measured before and after a maximal vasodilator dose of adenosine. Then maximal vasoconstrictions to Ang I or Ang II were measured: Ang I and Ang II were applied adjacent to arterioles (10(-2)-10(0) pmol) and venules (10(-1) pmol) in 10-microliter aliquots for 1 minute. Blood pressure (178 +/- 11/133 +/- 8 mm Hg) of renovascular hypertensive hamsters was elevated significantly over blood pressure of sham-operated hamsters (120 +/- 11/97 +/- 10 mm Hg). No change was observed in venular geometry or reactivity in renovascular hypertensive hamsters. Arteriolar luminal diameter, wall thickness, wall/lumen ratio, and wall area were not altered in hypertensive hamsters in the normal or vasodilated state; vasodilator capacity was the same in all groups. Conversion of Ang I to Ang II (response to Ang I divided by response to Ang II) for first-order and Third-order arterioles and third-order venules was 74 +/- 5, 79 +/- 3, and 72 +/- 6%, respectively, and was unaltered in renovascular hypertensive hamsters. Although vessel geometry was not altered, there was a significant shift to the left of the Ang I and Ang II dose-response curves of first-order and third-order arterioles, indicating increased sensitivity to these vasoconstrictors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Vasodilator drugs are widely used in the management of cardiovascular disease. They decrease systemic vascular resistance, but they also may influence vascular arterial compliance. This study evaluated the effects of three vasodilators--nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine--on vascular compliance using impedance parameters determined by pulse contour and Fourier analyses. The open chest study was performed on anesthetized dogs. Mean arterial pressure decreased by a minimum of 20% after vasodilator intervention. The decrease in systemic vascular resistance was significant (p less than 0.01) only after hydralazine treatment. Proximal compliance increased after administration of all drugs, but the increase was not statistically significant. Distal compliance determined by pulse contour analysis increased by 60 to 120% after all three drug treatments (p less than 0.05 for nitroprusside, p less than 0.02 for nitroglycerin and hydralazine). Characteristic impedance from Fourier analysis responded variably, and changes were not statistically significant. The sensitivity of changes in distal compliance as a marker for the vascular effect of these drugs suggests that it might be used as a more reliable guide than blood pressure or vascular resistance in monitoring clinical response to such intervention. The more traditional measure of characteristic impedance provides a vascular measurement that is less sensitive than distal compliance to the effects of these vasodilator drugs.\r"

This type of oscillatory behavior does not occur in tail arteries from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We have shown that the traits of norepinephrine-induced oscillatory activity and high blood pressure are genetically associated in SHRSP, suggesting that oscillatory activity is a primary vascular abnormality that contributes to hypertension in this strain. In the present experiments, two approaches were used to test the hypothesis that adrenal mineralocorticoids modulate expression of this genetically determined vascular abnormality in SHRSP. First, the effect of adrenalectomy on blood pressure and oscillatory activity was determined in SHRSP that underwent bilateral adrenalectomy 3 weeks before experimentation. Second, the effect of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt treatment on blood pressure and oscillatory activity was determined in 1) rats with no genetic background for oscillatory activity (WKY) and 2) progeny of SHRSP x WKY (F1 rats). Helically cut tail artery strips from all rats were mounted in isolated tissue baths for isometric force recording. Vessels were exposed to norepinephrine (6 x 10(-10) to 6 x 10(-6) M) for 20 minutes at each concentration. Oscillatory activity was defined as the sum of the phasic contractile amplitudes for all oscillations occurring during the final 10 minutes of norepinephrine incubation. Adrenalectomy markedly decreased blood pressure and oscillatory activity in SHRSP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Since both glucocorticoids and catecholamines are involved in the regulation of normal blood pressure, we investigated the modulation of beta-adrenergic receptors of cultured rat arterial smooth muscle cells by glucocorticoids. The synthetic glucocorticoids dexamethasone and RU 28362, at 10(-8) M concentration, increased maximum beta-adrenergic binding but had no effect on the dissociation constant (Kd). Each steroid caused an increase in maximum [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding over the concentration range of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, but not at 10(-9) M. The glucocorticoid effect on beta-adrenergic receptors of arterial smooth muscle cells required a minimum of 20 hours of incubation in the presence of the steroid and was significantly inhibited by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml), indicating that the glucocorticoid effect required protein synthesis. The effect of dexamethasone on [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was significantly inhibited by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486. Basal and agonist-stimulated cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels in arterial smooth muscle cells, before and after glucocorticoid treatment, were measured as an indicator of the physiological significance of the observed glucocorticoid-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptor binding. While causing no change in the basal cAMP level, treatment of arterial smooth muscle cells with 10(-6) M dexamethasone for 24 hours increased the 10(-6) M isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels.\r"

  ".W": "In renovascular hypertension adaptive mechanisms in the poststenotic kidney are a probable cause of the 20 to 25% false-negative findings during rapid sequence urography or [123I]o-iodohippurate renography. We blocked the renin-angiotensin system in an effort to increase the yield of these diagnostic procedures. Chronically instrumented, salt-depleted conscious dogs were used in which a light (n = 5), moderate (n = 4), or severe (n = 2) renal artery stenosis was induced. Before stenosis 10 of the dogs showed no left-right differences with either diagnostic procedure, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition did not change this result. Two to 3 weeks after induction of a renal artery stenosis, all dogs showed signs of renovascular hypertension. However, only 50% of the renograms and 22% of the urograms showed differences between the two kidneys indicative of the presence of stenosis. After ACE inhibition, all previously negative test results became positive (abnormal) and previously existing left-right differences became more evidence. Electromagnetically measured renal blood flow on the stenotic side did not change during ACE inhibition (146 +/- 13 vs 145 +/- 21 ml/min), whereas contralateral blood flow showed a distinct increase (207 +/- 18 vs 282 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.01). In conclusion, ACE inhibition markedly improves the sensitivity of rapid sequence urography and hippurate renography in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in the two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive dog. The effects of ACE inhibition on the handling of the different tracers do not appear to be related to its effects on renal blood flow or systemic blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the contribution of the endothelium to pressor and depressor responses in the isolated, perfused mesentery of mineralocorticoid hypertensive rats. Following uninephrectomy, adult male rats were made hypertensive by subcutaneous implantation of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA; 200 mg/kg); control rats were sham-treated. All rats received drinking water that contained 1.0% NaCl and 0.2% KCl. Following 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, the rats were anesthetized and the mesenteric vasculature was isolated and pump-perfused (constant flow with buffer) to evaluate changes in perfusion pressure. Vascular responses were determined before and after disruption of endothelial function by perfusion with oxygen free radicals generated in the buffer by electrical stimulation. Vasodilator responsiveness to acetylcholine and nitroprusside in the intact mesentery of hypertensive rats did not differ from that in the intact mesentery of normotensive rats, whereas pressor responses to norepinephrine in the intact mesentery of hypertensive rats were greater than normotensive values. Following disruption of endothelial function, depressor responses to acetylcholine were greatly attenuated whereas those to nitroprusside were unaltered or increased. Pressor responses to norepinephrine were potentiated in mesentery that had undergone endothelial disruption, and this potentiation was greater in hypertensive rats than in control rats. The slopes of pressure-flow curves in the presence of norepinephrine were less steep in mesentery with intact endothelium. The flow-modified component of these pressure-flow curves that was related to the endothelium was greater in mesenteric vascular beds of hypertensive rats. These results indicate that a factor released from the endothelium partially masks the enhanced vascular reactivity characteristic of this animal model of mineralocorticoid hypertension.\r"

The in vitro activity of tyrosine hydroxylase provides a measure of catecholamine synthesis and serves as a biochemical index of activity of noradrenergic neurons and the adrenal medulla. Mean atrial pressure rose from 91.5 +/- 1.0 to 128.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) in the 1K1C group and from 91.8 +/- 1.3 to 106.5 +/- 5.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) in the 2K1C group, whereas no change in blood pressure was found in their respective controls. Adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activity was increased 85% in the 1K1C group, as compared with values in one-kidney controls (from 11.8 +/- 1.5 to 21.8 +/- 1.1 pmol CO2/min/mg; p less than 0.0002), and was increased 49% in the 2K1C group, as compared with values in two-kidney controls (from 8.01 +/- 1.2 to 11.9 +/- 1.1 pmol CO2/min/mg; p less than 0.02).

Nifedipine concentrations were well correlated with the fall in systolic blood pressure in individual subjects, and the mean responsiveness was -0.48 mm Hg/ng/ml after the first dose, -0.45 mm Hg/ng/ml after 1 week, and -0.49 mm Hg/ng/ml after 6 weeks. The responsiveness to the first dose of nifedipine was significantly correlated with the responsiveness after 1 (r = 0.83) and 6 weeks (r = 0.78) of therapy and with the height of the pretreatment blood pressure (r = 0.6).

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides, higher at study entry in the nuns, increased similarly over time in the two groups. Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium excretion, collected randomly in both groups, did not differ over time between nuns and controls. None of the women smoked or used oral contraceptives. Educational level was higher in the control group, but subgroups of 48 nuns and 52 laywomen of comparable educational level maintained the same difference in the blood pressure trend over time as in the main cohort.

Six subjects cycled at approximately 65% of their maximum O2 uptake in a warm environment (30 degrees C, 40% relative humidity). After 30 min of control (C) exercise (no infusion), PV decreased 13.0%, or 419 +/- 106 (SD) ml, heart rate (HR) increased to 167 +/- 3 beats/min, and esophageal temperature (Tes) rose to 38.19 +/- 0.09 degrees C (SE). During infusion studies (INF), infusates were started after 10 min of exercise. The infusates contained 5% albumin suspended in 0.45, 0.9, or 3.0% saline. The volume of each infusate was adjusted so that during the last 10 min of exercise PV was maintained at the preexercise level and osmolality was allowed to differ. HR was significantly lower (10-16 beats/min) during INF than during C. Tes was reduced significantly during INF, with trends for increased skin blood flow and decreased sweating rates. No significant differences in HR, Tes, or sweating rate occurred between the three infusion conditions. We conclude that the decrease in PV, which normally accompanies moderate cycle exercise, compromises circulatory and thermal regulations. Increases in osmolality appear to have small if any effects during such short-term exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Bed rest (BR) is associated with a decrease in plasma volume (PV), which may contribute to the impaired orthostatic and exercise tolerances seen immediately after BR. The purpose of this study was to determine whether increases in blood estrogen concentration, either during normal menstrual cycles or during exogenous estrogen administration, would attenuate this loss of PV. Nineteen healthy women (21-39 yr of age) completed the study. Twelve women underwent duplicate 11-day BR without estrogen supplementation. PV decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) during both BR's, from 2,531 +/- 113 to 2,027 +/- 102 ml during BR1 and from 2,445 +/- 115 to 2,244 +/- 96 ml during BR2. The women who began BR in the periovulatory stage of the menstrual cycle (n = 3), a time of elevated endogenous estrogens, had a transient delay in loss of PV during the first 5 days of BR. Women who began BR during other stages of the menstrual cycle (n = 17) showed the established trend to decrease PV primarily during the first few days of BR. Seven additional women underwent a single 12-day BR while taking estrogen supplementation (1.25 mg/day premarin). PV decreased during the first 4-5 days of BR, then returned toward the pre-BR level during the remainder of the BR (pre-BR PV, 2,525 +/- 149 ml; post-BR PV, 2,519 +/- 162 ml). Thus menstrual fluctuations in endogenous estrogens appear to have only small transient effects on the loss of PV during BR, whereas exogenous estrogen supplementation significantly attenuates PV loss.\r"

To extend these findings, as well as to determine whether other acids elicit comparable results, this report compares the cardiopulmonary response between right atrial infusion of lactic acid and HCl in awake ponies. Lactic acid, infused at a dose of 1.5 mmol/kg over 18 min, lowered systemic and pulmonary arterial pH 0.062 and 0.092 U, respectively, and increased pulmonary arterial pressure (delta Ppa, 4 mmHg), heart rate (HR, 4/min), and tidal volume (delta VT, 190 ml/m2). HCl, infused at a reduced dose of 0.5 mmol/kg over 18 min, lowered systemic and pulmonary arterial pH 0.024 and 0.047 U, respectively, but produced increases in Ppa (delta 23 mmHg), HR (delta 42/min), and VT (delta 321 ml/m2) that were significantly greater than from the larger dose of lactic acid. These results indicate that cardiopulmonary responses to infusion acidosis differ between the type of acid infused. It is suggested that, in the unanesthetized pony, HCl-induced infusion acidosis has a unique cardiopulmonary-stimulating action unrelated to the pH changes imparted to the circulating arterial blood and that this response is absent during the infusion of lactic acid.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether upper airway mechanoreceptors partly subserve the ventilatory response to external mechanical loading in conscious humans, we studied 11 laryngectomized subjects. The oropharynx (OP) or tracheostomy was selectively loaded (in random order) by attaching the mouth or tracheal tube to a special pressure-generating apparatus, and steady-state ventilatory responses were recorded. Phasic negative pressure changes generated at the OP to simulate inspiratory resistive loading, expiratory resistive unloading, and elastic loading resulted in trivial prolongation of inspiratory duration by 12, 9, and 4%, respectively; other ventilatory variables were not significantly altered. Phasic positive pressure changes at the OP that simulated inspiratory resistive unloading and expiratory resistive loading had little effect on breathing pattern. When the above loads were applied via the tracheostomy, using pressures of similar magnitude, ventilatory responses were qualitatively similar and quantitatively not significantly different from those of normal healthy controls. The results suggest that the OP does not make an important contribution to ventilatory responses during external mechanical loading in conscious humans. Loading responses to conventional mechanical loads are preserved in the absence of afferent information from the upper airways.\r"

The animals were subjected daily to 2 h of treadmill running at 24 degrees C or for the same period of time at -5 degrees C, with or without exercise, for 28 days. Exercise training lowered serum triglycerides (P less than 0.01), whereas serum cholesterol was reduced by cold exposure (P less than 0.05). Cholesterol lowering occurred in the lipoproteins of lower densities. WAT weight was diminished by both treatments. Exercise training had an overall lowering effect on WAT total LPL activity (P less than 0.05), whereas cold exposure did not affect enzyme activity significantly. Exercise and intermittent cold interacted on BAT weight. Cold increased total BAT LPL activity (P less than 0.03), whereas simultaneous exercise in the cold greatly diminished this effect. Serum insulin levels were not affected by either treatment. Thus, in WAT, intermittent exposure to cold did not have any lasting effect on LPL activity, whereas exercise training decreased the latter. In contrast, exercise did not influence LPL in BAT of rats not exposed to cold but prevented the stimulation of enzyme activity induced by repeated cold exposure. These results support the notion that the regulation of LPL is tissue specific.\r"

In the supine animal, interstitial extrapleural catheter pressure data obtained at recording heights ranging from 15 to 80% of pleural cavity lay on the identity line when plotted vs. the micropipette pressure values simultaneously gathered from the same tissues. We conclude that 1) micropipettes and catheters-cannulas yield similar results when recording from the same compartment and 2) the hydraulic pressure in the parietal extrapleural interstitium is less negative than that in the pleural space.\r"

Anesthetized dogs were studied at various levels of steady-state and progressive hypercapnia during spontaneous breathing and during CFV. When steady-state and progressive hypercapnia were compared, the frequency and height of the MTA phrenic neurogram were independent of the rate of induction of hypercapnia during each mode of ventilation. During spontaneous ventilation, the response to hypercapnia comprised mainly an increase in frequency with only a slight increase in the amplitude of the MTA phrenic waveform. During muscular paralysis and CFV, the responses were similar to those observed after vagotomy with mainly an increase in the amplitude and only a small increase in frequency. For both spontaneous breathing and CFV, increases in frequency were achieved mainly by a shortening in expiratory time with the inspiratory time remaining relatively constant. Our data support the concept of a centrally patterned respiratory generator, whose inherent pattern is modified by phasic feedback from peripheral receptors mainly of vagal origin.\r"

Thirty-eight normal subjects walked comfortably on a treadmill while breathing through a pneumotachograph. We analyzed the time intervals between heel strikes and the onset of inspiration (or expiration) for evidence of phase locking between steps and breaths, using Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability that n consecutive inspirations (or expirations) would begin at a constant time interval +/- 0.10 s from heel strikes by chance. We developed empirical criteria for rhythm synchronization during series of four or more breaths, while maintaining an estimated specificity of 95%. The majority of subjects showed some evidence of entrainment (29 +/- 23% of breaths on average), which occurred intermittently, usually lasting less than 10 breaths at a time. The precision of phase locking during spontaneous entrainment was similar to that in 10 subjects who attempted to maintain deliberate entrainment. The results suggest that the walking cadence provides a persuasive, but not dominant, input to the central breathing pattern generator. The present method can detect entrainment even when it occurs sporadically or with varying coupling pattern.\r"

By the use of double-blind procedures, met-hGH (2.67 mg/0.5 ml diluent, 3 days/wk) and bacteriostatic water (placebo, 0.5 ml, 3 days/wk) were administered in a repeated-measures design that counterbalanced treatment order. Duration of each treatment was 6 wk. Subjects trained with progressive resistance exercise throughout and were maintained on a high-protein diet monitored by extensive compositional analyses of daily dietary intake records. Hydrodensitometry revealed that met-hGH significantly decreased percent body fat (%fat) and increased fat-free weight (FFW) and FFW/fat weight (FW), whereas the placebo treatment did not change any of these measures. Changes in FFW/FW correlated with the relative dose of met-hGH but did not correlate with either the peak GH response to L-dopa/arginine stimulation or IGF-I levels obtained after treatment with placebo. There were no differences between treatments in the dietary intakes of total kilocalories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Mean IGF-I levels were elevated after treatment with met-hGH compared with postplacebo levels. After treatment with met-hGH, five of seven subjects had a suppressed GH response to stimulation from either L-dopa/arginine or submaximal exercise. We conclude that supraphysiological doses of met-hGH will alter body composition in exercising adults in a relative dose-dependent manner and that such treatment may suppress endogenous release of GH in some individuals.\r"

Protein clearance, measured from the residual 125I-albumin in the lung homogenate, was slow and monoexponential (approximately 1%/h), similar to our previous data for protein clearance from the lungs in sheep. Lung liquid clearance in dogs, however, was 50% less than in previous experiments in sheep. Residual lung liquid (as percent of instilled) was 88.7 +/- 7.0 at 4 h, 70.5 +/- 9.1 at 8 h, and 64.0 +/- 5.8 at 12 h. At each time period, alveolar protein concentration increased by 0.6 +/- 0.4 g/dl at 4 h, 1.3 +/- 1.2 g/dl at 8 h, and 2.1 +/- 0.8 g/dl at 12 h. This increase in alveolar protein concentration was proportional to the volume of liquid removed from the lungs. beta-Adrenergic agonist therapy with terbutaline (10(-5) M mixed with the instilled plasma) doubled the volume of liquid cleared from the lungs over 4 h, and the alveolar protein concentration increased proportionally. However, lung liquid clearance in dogs that were treated with beta-agonists was proportionally (50%) less than in sheep treated with beta-agonists. The slower liquid clearance in dogs compared with sheep cannot be explained by differences in hemodynamics, pulmonary blood flow, anesthesia, mode of ventilation, or alveolar surface area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data obtained from 15 different lung specimens showed that the radioligands bound to single high-affinity sites with dissociation constant (Kd) values ranging from 1 to 9 nM for [3H]PZ and 0.03 to 0.46 nM for [3H]QNB. Comparison of total binding capacity values by equilibrium experiments with [3H]PZ, unlabeled PZ, and [3H]QNB indicates that approximately one-half of the total muscarinic binding sites in human peripheral lung binds PZ with high affinity (putative M1-subtypes). Kd values for muscarinic agents determined by competition experiments with [3H]PZ were consistent with the expected rank order of potency for interactions with muscarinic receptors. Characterization of the role of these muscarinic receptor subtypes in human lung responses may lead to the development of more selective therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic obstructive airway diseases.\r"

A plot of PVO2 vs. TO2 showed higher levels of PVO2 (P less than 0.05) in LF than HF, when compared at similar levels of TO2. Therefore the experimental protocol allowed the comparison of the separate effects of TO2 or PVO2 on VO2. Plotting VO2 as a function of TO2 revealed two distinct curves (P less than 0.05), with LF having a greater VO2 than HF at a given TO2. Conversely, a plot of VO2 as a function of PVO2 did not show a difference between the groups. The ERO2 of LF was greater than HF when compared at similar levels of TO2 (P less than 0.05). We conclude from these data that during progressive hypoxemia VO2 appears to be primarily limited by factors that determine capillary O2 diffusion. This conclusion supports the Kroghian theory of capillary O2 exchange.\r"

O2 consumption (VO2), O2 transport (TO2), venous PO2 (PVO2), venous lactate concentration, and venous glucose concentration were measured. The relative concentration of ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH (pHi) were monitored with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. PCr/Pi decreased with the onset of ischemia or hypoxemia. The preparation was reoxygenated and allowed to recover for 30 min once PCr/Pi was less than 1.0. The periods of hypoxemia and ischemia lasted 56.0 +/- 10.0 and 63.8 +/- 2.5 min, respectively (NS). During ischemia PCr decreased and Pi increased compared with control (P less than 0.05) but returned to control with reperfusion. With hypoxemia PCr also decreased and Pi increased with respect to control (P less than 0.01) but did not recover with reoxygenation. VO2 and PVO2 in both groups returned to control during recovery. ATP did not change with ischemia but decreased with hypoxemia (P less than 0.05). Venous lactate concentration did not change with ischemia but increased with hypoxemia (P less than 0.05) and continued to rise during recovery. During recovery pHi decreased in the hypoxemic group (P less than 0.05) but not in the ischemic group. These data show that, under the conditions tested, rabbit skeletal muscle does not resynthesize PCr after a severe hypoxemic episode. Furthermore it appears that VO2 and PVO2 fail to portray the true state of cellular bioenergetics after a severe hypotemic insult.\r"

To determine whether pulmonary microvascular permeability is increased by coronary ischemia, we measured pulmonary hemodynamics, lung lymph flow (QL), and lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/P) in 12 sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulas. Studies were done in 3 groups: in group 1 (n = 7) a marginal branch of the left circumflex artery (Lcx) was occluded, in group 2 (n = 5) left atrial pressure (Pla) was mechanically raised by 10 mmHg, and in group 3 (n = 5) Lcx was occluded and Pla was raised by 10 mmHg. In group 1, coronary occlusion increased QL (4.6 +/- 0.4 to 8.3 +/- 2.6 ml/h) without changes in L/P. In group 2, elevated Pla increased QL (5.1 +/- 1.2 to 10.1 +/- 3.0 ml/h) with decreases in L/P (0.71 +/- 0.02 to 0.61 +/- 0.02). In group 3, coronary occlusion with elevated Pla caused a further increase in QL (5.0 +/- 1.5 to 16.9 +/- 4.6 ml/h) without significant decreases in L/P (0.71 +/- 0.01 to 0.65 +/- 0.06). Lung lymph concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (a degradation product of prostacyclin) increased transiently after coronary occlusion. These results indicate that coronary occlusion can increase transcapillary protein transport in lungs of conscious sheep and simultaneously increase prostacyclin production in the lung.\r"

Graded dosages of phenylephrine were given to eight treadmill-trained dogs and to eight untrained dogs; both groups were chronically instrumented and were sedated and resting when tested. These dosages were repeated after ganglionic blockade. Aortic pressure, cardiac output, central venous pressure, peripheral resistance, and heart rate were each averaged over 30 s before injection and 90 s after injection. The slope of the peripheral resistance-dose relationship was significantly increased in trained compared with untrained dogs in both the unblocked and blocked cases [unblocked: trained 0.89, untrained 0.47; blocked: trained 4.30, untrained 2.05 (mmHg.l-1.min)/(microgram.kg-1)]. The unblocked resistance slopes were reduced with respect to the blocked slopes by 77 (untrained) and 79% (trained). The slope of the heart rate-aortic pressure response was reduced, but not significantly, by endurance training. We conclude that 6 wk of endurance training in dogs resulted in a doubling of the vascular responsiveness to an alpha 1-agonist, with no significant change in the baroreflex regulation of resistance or heart rate.\r"

The receptors were localized and separated into three groups: extrathoracic tracheal, intrathoracic tracheal, and intrapulmonary receptors. The influence of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFO) at 29 Hz on receptor discharge was analyzed by separating the response to the associated shift in functional residual capacity (FRC) from the oscillatory component of the response. PSR activity during HFO was increased from spontaneous breathing (49%) and from the static FRC shift (25%). PSR activity during the static inflation was increased 19% over spontaneous breathing. RAR activity was also increased with HFO. These results demonstrate that 1) the increased activity of PSR and RAR during HFO is due primarily to the oscillating action of the ventilator and secondarily to the shift in FRC associated with HFO, 2) the increased PSR activity during HFO may account for the observed apneic response, and 3) PSR response generally decreases with increasing distance from the tracheal opening.\r"

This concentration difference could promote the osmotic movement of water from the air spaces to the perfusate, but the rate of fluid extraction from the air spaces would then be limited by the rates of electrolyte transport through the epithelium. In the present study, measurements were made of solute and water losses from the air spaces of fluid-filled rat lungs and the transport of these solutes and water into the vasculature after addition of hypertonic glucose or sucrose to the perfusate. Increases in the concentrations of Na+, Cl-, K+, and labeled mannitol in the air space were initially comparable to those of albumin labeled with Evans blue. Similarly, decreases in electrolyte concentrations in the perfusate were comparable to those of labeled albumin, indicating that very little solute accompanied the movement of water out of the lungs. Nor was evidence found that exposure of the vasculature to hypertonic glucose resulted in an increase in the rate at which fluid was reabsorbed from the air spaces over a 1-h interval, aside from an initial, abrupt loss of solute-free water from the lungs. These observations suggest that perfusion of fluid-filled lungs with hypertonic solutions of small solutes results in the extraction of water from the air spaces and pulmonary parenchyma across membranes that resist the movement of electrolytes and other lipophobic solutes.\r"

We measured 1) the transdiaphragmatic pressure obtained in response to 20- and 100-Hz stimulation of phrenic nerves (Pdi20 and Pdi100), 2) the power spectrum of diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG), 3) the ratio of integrated diaphragmatic EMG to Pdi (Edi/Pdi), and 4) the rate of relaxation of Pdi100 and Pdi20. Arterial blood pressure (Pa) was reduced to 40-50 mmHg by a balloon inflated in the inferior vena cava and was maintained at this level until Pdi100 declined to 75% of the control value (100% shock time, ST). A recovery period of 60 min at normal Pa was allowed. During hypotension, Pdi100 and Pdi20 declined only at 100% ST [95.0 +/- 13.0 (SE) min]; however, only Pdi100 recovered within 15 min. The power spectrum shifted to low frequencies early and progressively during shock period. Edi/Pdi rose significantly at 80 and 100% ST and recovered within 15 min. The relaxation rate of Pdi20 and Pdi100 increased significantly at 100% ST only. We conclude that 1) diaphragmatic contractility is depressed during severe hypotension, 2) changes in the power spectrum occurred first in the shock state, followed by alterations in Edi/Pdi, and subsequently both changes in the frequency-pressure curve and relaxation rate occurred last.\r"

Data from 30 of these women were used to develop an equation to predict the percent VO2max from submaximal heart rates. This equation and the submaximal VO2 were used to predict VO2max in the remaining 10 women. The accuracy of VO2max values estimated by this procedure was compared with values predicted by two popular methods: the Astrand nomogram and the VO2 vs. heart rate (VO2-HR) curve. VO2max values estimated by the derived equation method in the 10 validation subjects were only 3.7 +/- 12.2% higher than actual values (P greater than 0.05). The Astrand method overestimated VO2max by 9.0 +/- 19.4% (P greater than 0.05), whereas the VO2-HR curve method underestimated VO2max by only 1.6 +/- 10.3% in the same 10 subjects (P greater than 0.05). Both the Astrand and the VO2-HR curve methods correlated well with the actual values when all 40 subjects were considered (r = 0.77 and 0.85, respectively), but the VO2-HR curve method had a lower SE of prediction than the Astrand method (8.7 vs. 10.4%). In a comparison group of 10 nonpregnant sedentary women (29.9 +/- 4.5 yr), an equation relating %VO2max to HR nearly identical to that obtained in the pregnant women was found, suggesting that pregnancy does not alter this relationship. We conclude that extrapolating the VO2-HR curve to an estimated maximal HR is the most accurate method of predicting VO2max in pregnant women.\r"

Pulmonary vascular tone was evaluated by five-point pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP)/cardiac index (Q) plots and intrapulmonary shunt was measured using a SF6 infusion. PAP/Q plots were rectilinear in all experimental conditions. In control dogs (n = 8), oleic acid (0.09 ml/kg iv) increased PAP over the range of Q studied (1-5 l.min-1.m-2). At the same Q, arterial PO2 fell from 186 +/- 11 to 65 +/- 8 (SE) Torr and intrapulmonary shunt rose from 5 +/- 1 to 50 +/- 6% 90 min after oleic acid injection. These changes remained stable during the generation of two consecutive PAP/Q plots.

The rebreathing bag was initially filled with approximately 1.0 liter of gas containing 0.6% C2H2, 0.3% C18O, 9% He, and 35-40% O2. End-tidal gas concentrations were measured with a respiratory mass spectrometer. The disappearance of C2H2 and C18O was measured with respect to He to calculate Qc and DLCO. Values for DLCO in dogs, expressed per kilogram of body weight, were much larger than those reported in humans. However, at a given level of absolute O2 consumption, measurements of absolute DLCO in dogs were comparable to those reported in humans by both rebreathing and steady-state methods at rest and near-maximal exercise. These results suggest that DLCO is more closely matched to the metabolic capacity (i.e., maximal O2 consumption) than to body size between these two species.\r"

RRdi was measured as the maximum rate of decline in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) corrected for the change in Pdi [maximum relaxation rate (MRR)/delta Pdi], the time constant (tau) of the later exponential decline in Pdi, and the time to half relaxation (1/2 RT). In five subjects there was no difference in mean RRdi apart from a smaller MRR/delta Pdi (P less than 0.05) for left unilateral compared with either right unilateral or bilateral needle stimulation. However, RRdi varied unpredictably between unilateral and bilateral stimulation of the phrenic nerve in individual subjects. In the same five subjects, sniffs were found to have a slower RRdi than bilateral stimulations (MRR/delta Pdi 0.0064 +/- 0.0007 vs. 0.0074 +/- 0.0018/ms, tau 57.2 +/- 8.7 vs. 48.2 +/- 7.4 ms, 1/2 RT 108.9 +/- 10.9 vs. 73.9 +/- 6.0 ms; all P less than 0.05). The application and inflation of an abdominal binder to an external pressure of 60 mmHg resulted in a decrease in functional residual capacity (-710 +/- 70 ml), but there was no effect on relaxation parameters. Our findings suggest that in the evaluation of RRdi 1) unilateral hemidiaphragmatic stimulations may not accurately reflect the in vivo contractile properties of the diaphragm, 2) sniff maneuvers are not voluntary equivalents of phrenic nerve stimulations, and 3) RRdi is not affected by abdominal binder inflation up to 60 mmHg.\r"

Measurements were made with principal ponies in clinical remission (period A) and during acute airway obstruction (period B). The blockade had no effect on base-line pulmonary mechanics in control ponies during periods A and B or in the principal ponies during period A. However, in the principal ponies during period B, blockade increased dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and decreased pulmonary resistance (RL). Phenylephrine had no effect on the controls during either period. In the principals, phenylephrine decreased Cdyn and increased RL during both periods. The alpha 1-agonist aerosol prazosin shifted the phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right, but prasozin did not bronchodilate the principals during period B. This suggests that the role of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in airway narrowing in ponies with recurrent airway obstruction is minimal. However, the response to phenylephrine in only the principal ponies suggests an increase in alpha-receptor numbers and/or activity in these animals compared with controls.\r"

Gastrocnemius citrate synthase activity was increased in TR by day 14 of training (P less than 0.05) and was followed by a second significant increase between days 24 and 36 (P less than 0.05). Although inguinal (ING), parametrial (PAR), and retroperitoneal (RP) cell sizes were decreased by the swimming program (P less than 0.05), adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was suppressed (P less than 0.05) by training during the first 24 days in PAR and RP depots only. Thereafter, PAR and RP LPL activities increased in TR animals (P less than 0.05) to reach values similar to SED at the end of the study. These results further establish the regionally specific response of adipose tissue metabolism to endurance training. They also suggest that, when fat cell triacylglycerol depletion reaches a smaller level, LPL activity could be involved in the process of stabilizing fat cell size.\r"

However a potency difference of 100-fold for isoproterenol (IC50 = 4.80 X 10(-8) M for EFS and 3.70 X 10(-6) M for ACh) and 10-fold for both epinephrine and norepinephrine was observed for inhibition of responses to EFS compared with responses to ACh. The inhibitory effects of isoproterenol on responses to EFS were prevented by propranolol and ICI 118551 (a beta 2-antagonist) but not by betaxolol (a beta 1-antagonist). Tyramine had no effect on contractions elicited by EFS. These experiments demonstrate that beta-agonists inhibit cholinergic nerve-induced contractions of human bronchi more potently than contractions induced by exogenous ACh, suggesting modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission by prejunctional beta 2-receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of decreased lung volume on ventilatory responses to arteriovenous fistula-induced increased cardiac output was studied in four chronic awake dogs. Lung volume decreases were imposed by application of continuous negative-pressure breathing of -10 cmH2O to the trachea. The animals were surgically prepared with chronic tracheostomy, indwelling carotid artery catheter, and bilateral arteriovenous femoral shunts. Control arteriovenous blood flow was 0.5 l/min, and test flow level was 2.0 l/min. Arterial blood CO2 tension (PaCO2) was continuously monitored using an indwelling Teflon membrane mass spectrometer catheter, and inhaled CO2 was given to maintain isocapnia throughout. Increased fistula flow alone led to a mean 52% increase in cardiac output (CO), whereas mean systemic arterial blood pressure (Psa) fell 4% (P less than 0.01). Negative-pressure breathing alone raised Psa by 3% (P less than 0.005) without a significant change in CO. Expired minute ventilation (VE) increased by 27% (P less than 0.005) from control in both of these conditions separately. Combined increased flow and negative pressure led to a 50% increase in CO and 56% increase in VE (P less than 0.0025) without any significant change in Psa. Effects of decreased lung volume and increased CO appeared to be additive with respect to ventilation and to occur under conditions of constant PaCO2 and Psa. Because both decreased lung volume and increased CO occur during normal exercise, these results suggest that mechanisms other than chemical regulation may play an important role in the control of breathing and contribute new insights into the isocapnic exercise hyperpnea phenomenon.\r"

Paired rings of third- (segmental), fourth- and fifth-order (subsegmental) bronchi, with and without epithelium, were placed in organ chambers in physiological salt solution (95% O2-5% CO2, 37 degrees C). Removal of the epithelium caused a leftward shift in the concentration-effect curve for acetylcholine (3rd and 4th order). A similar shift occurred for histamine (3rd and 5th order). The relaxation to isoproterenol was reduced by epithelium removal in a similar fashion in the three orders. Removal of the epithelium reduced the maximal response to KCl (3rd and 4th order) and acetylcholine (5th order). The peak response to nerve stimulation showed a significant rightward shift in the absence of epithelium. In fifth-order bronchi, tissues with epithelium showed a significantly greater degree of fade of the response to sustained electrical stimulation. Thus both epithelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors may be released in porcine airways.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the combined effect of an increase in inspiratory flow rate and frequency on the O2 cost of inspiratory resistive breathing (VO2 resp). In each of three to six pairs of runs we measured VO2 resp in six normal subjects breathing through an inspiratory resistance with a constant tidal volume (VT). One of each pair of runs was performed at an inspiratory muscle contraction frequency of approximately 10/min and the other at approximately 30/min. Inspiratory mouth pressure was 45 +/- 2% (SE) of maximum at the lower contraction frequency and 43 +/- 2% at the higher frequency. Duty cycle (the ratio of contraction time to total cycle time) was constant at 0.51 +/- 0.01. However, during the higher frequency runs, two of every three contractions were against an occluded airway. Because VT and duty cycle were kept constant, mean inspiratory flow rate increased with frequency. Careful selection of appropriate parameters allowed the pairs of runs to be matched both for work rate and pressure-time product. The VO2 resp did not increase, despite approximately threefold increases in both inspiratory flow rate and contraction frequency. On the contrary, there was a trend toward lower values for VO2 resp during the higher frequency runs. Because these were performed at a slightly lower mean lung volume, a second study was designed to measure the VO2 resp of generating the same inspiratory pressure (45% maximum static inspiratory mouth pressure at functional residual capacity) at the same frequency but at two different lung volumes. This was achieved with a negligibly small work rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven weanling rabbits consumed a low iron diet and underwent phlebotomy twice weekly for 6 mo, resulting in severe anemia (mean Hb 5.5 g/dl). Compared with control animals, tibialis anterior skeletal muscles of iron-deficient animals exhibited reduced concentrations of cytochrome c (4.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.7 nmol/g tissue; P less than 0.01), and reduced activities of citrate synthase (83 +/- 10 vs. 133 +/- 13 mU/mg protein; P less than 0.01) and cytochrome-c oxidase (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.5 U/mg protein; P less than 0.05). In these muscles mitochondria were swollen and displayed deformed cristae. Less severe biochemical abnormalities were observed in cardiac and soleus skeletal muscles. Ten days of continuous electrical stimulation of the motor nerve supplying anterior compartment muscles of iron-deficient rabbits increased expression of mitochondrial proteins: cytochrome c was increased to 154% of control levels (P less than 0.05), and cytochrome-c oxidase and citrate synthase activities were increased to 199 and 272% of control levels, respectively (P less than 0.005).

Hyperoxia also increased lung glutathione (GSH) + oxidized glutathione (GSSG) content and the magnitude of this hyperoxic response of increased GSH + GSSG, G-6-P, and GR (maximal 1.3- to 1.8-fold) declined as a function of age during the first 3 wk of life. Fetal rat lung explants cultured 4 days in 95% O2 showed increased G-6-P and GR activity and increased levels of the specific proteins 1.5-fold those of explants at 2 days of culture. We conclude that the hyperoxic response of increased rat lung G-6-P and GR activity in vivo and in vitro involves not just alteration of enzyme activity but also specific increases in the proteins catalyzing the reactions.\r"

The experiments followed several days of different exercise-diet regimens eliciting either low (LMG; 141.0 +/- 10.5 mmol.kg.dry wt-1) or normal (NMG; 526.2 +/- 44.2 mmol.kg.dry wt-1) prewarming muscle glycogen levels. Cold-water immersion was performed for 180 min or to a rectal temperature (Tre) of 35.5 degrees C. In four subjects (group A, body fat = 20 +/- 1%), postimmersion Tre was similar to preimmersion Tre for both trials (36.73 +/- 0.18 vs. 37.26 +/- 0.18 degrees C, respectively). Passive rewarming in group A resulted in an increase in Tre of only 0.13 +/- 0.08 degrees C. Conversely, initial rewarming Tre for the other four subjects (group B, body fat = 12 +/- 1%) averaged 35.50 +/- 0.05 degrees C for both trials. Rewarming increased Tre similarly in group B during both LMG (0.76 +/- 0.25 degrees C) and NMG (0.89 +/- 0.13 degrees C). Afterdrop responses, evident only in those individuals whose body core cooled during immersion (group B), were not different between LMG and NMG. These data support the contention that Tre responses during passive rewarming are related to body insulation. Furthermore these results indicate that low muscle glycogen levels do not impair rewarming time nor alter after-drop responses during passive rewarming after mild-to-moderate hypothermia.\r"

Peripheral sweat production was determined using pilocarpine iontophoresis in 40 volunteers (10 sedentary men, 10 endurance-trained men, 10 sedentary women, 10 endurance-trained women). Peripheral sweat rate was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater in trained men [6.9 +/- 0.6 (SE) g.m2.min-1] and women (6.1 +/- 0.7) compared with sedentary men (3.1 +/- 0.5) and women (2.5 +/- 0.4). Furthermore, peripheral sweat rate was significantly correlated (r = 0.73) with maximal O2 uptake. The above two findings would suggest that physical training improves the secretory activity of the human sweat gland. Such a result supports previous findings that have suggested that the potentiation in sweating seen after training is achieved via a peripheral mechanism. In addition, several gender-related differences were found in the sudorific response of men and women. Specifically, women have a significantly greater sweat gland density, whereas men have a greater sweat production per gland.\r"

Our hypothesis that VO2max is limited by O2 diffusion in muscle predicts that decreases in VO2max, caused by hypoxemia, will be accompanied by proportional decreases in muscle effluent venous PO2 (PvO2). By altering the fraction of inspired O2, four levels of arterial PO2 (PaO2) [21 +/- 2, 28 +/- 1, 44 +/- 1, and 80 +/- 2 (SE) Torr] were induced in each of eight dogs. Muscle arterial and venous circulation was isolated and arterial pressure held constant by pump perfusion. Each muscle worked maximally (3 min at 5-6 Hz, isometric twitches) at each PaO2. Arterial and venous samples were taken to measure lactate, [H+], PO2, PCO2, and muscle VO2. Muscle biopsies were taken to measure [H+] (homogenate method) and lactate. VO2max decreased with PaO2 and was linearly (R = 0.99) related to both PVO2 and O2 delivery. As PaO2 fell, fatigue increased while muscle lactate and [H+] increased. Lactate release from the muscle did not change with PaO2. This suggests a barrier to lactate efflux from muscle and a possible cause of the greater fatigue seen in hypoxemia. The gas exchange data are consistent with the hypothesis that VO2max is limited by peripheral tissue diffusion of O2.\r"

Serial measurements of MEF and V were obtained from a cohort of healthy 6- to 27-yr-old males (n = 26) and females (n = 21) over a period of 18 yr. Data were analyzed using logarithmic transformation of the power law equation, MEF = aVb, to fit a regression line to each subject's data points. These growth trajectories were satisfactorily modeled as parallel lines with 20-30% variability of their y-intercepts, indicating that substantial intersubject variability of MEF relative to V is present in early childhood and remains constant during growth. The results further indicate that MEF does track V during lung growth. We conclude that dysanapsis originates in early childhood.\r"

Three chloromethyl ketone (CK) derivatives [N-tosyl-L-lysine (CK)-(TLCK), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine CK(TPCK), methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val CK(SPCK)] and a single synthetic proteinase substrate [N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (TAME)] attenuated endotoxin-induced cytotoxicity (lactate dehydrogenase release) and prostacyclin production in a dose-related fashion. The most effective inhibitors of endotoxin-induced cytotoxicity were TLCK and TPCK. TLCK and TAME most effectively attenuated endotoxin-stimulated prostacyclin production. Two chemically unrelated substances, soybean trypsin inhibitor and alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor also attenuated the endotoxin response. In the absence of FBS or in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated FBS, antiproteases attenuated endotoxin-induced prostacyclin production but had less effect on cytotoxicity than with 10% FBS. We also measured the capacity of the CK inhibitors to scavenge superoxide radicals generated in a cell-free xanthine/xanthine oxidase system by measuring inhibition of cytochrome c reduction. Percent scavenging of superoxide by these inhibitors was as follows: TLCK, 62.7 +/- 5.8 (SE); TPCK, 83.9 +/- 7.7; TAME, 24.5 +/- 6.4; SPCK, 0. We conclude that certain proteinase inhibitors attenuate endotoxin-induced endothelial cytotoxicity and prostacyclin production and that direct scavenging of superoxide radicals fails to explain the protective effects of proteinase inhibition. We speculate that the effects of endotoxin on lung endothelium may involve proteolytic mechanisms even in the absence of neutrophils.\r"

Furthermore we predicted that maximal respiratory pressures are limited by the strength of the weaker muscle involved. To test these hypotheses, we measured the pleural pressure, abdominal pressure (Pab), and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during maximal inspiratory, open-glottis and closed-glottis expulsive, and combined inspiratory and expulsive maneuvers in four adults. We then determined the activation of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles during selected maximal respiratory maneuvers, using electromyography and phrenic nerve stimulation. In all subjects, the Pdi generated during maximal inspiratory efforts was significantly lower than the Pdi generated during open-glottis expulsive or combined efforts, suggesting that rib cage, not diaphragm, strength limits maximal inspiratory pressure. Similarly, at high lung volumes, the Pab generated during closed-glottis expulsive efforts was significantly greater than that generated during open-glottis efforts, suggesting that the latter pressure is limited by diaphragm, not abdominal muscle, strength. As predicted, diaphragm activation was submaximal during maximal inspiratory efforts, and abdominal muscle activation was submaximal during open-glottis expulsive efforts at midlung volume. Additionally, assisting the inspiratory muscles of the rib cage with negative body-surface pressure significantly increased maximal inspiratory pressure, whereas loading the rib cage muscles with rib cage compression decreased maximal inspiratory pressure. We conclude that activation of the chest wall muscles during static respiratory efforts is determined by the relative strengths and mechanical advantage of the muscles involved.\r"

Inflation (Si) and collapsing (Sc) compliance were determined by altering transmural pressure from 30 to 0 Torr and -30 to 0 Torr, respectively, both during control (C) and after acetylcholine (ACh) administration (experimental, E). Flow (V = 2-15 l/min) was then introduced through the tracheal lumen while chamber pressure (Pc) was increased from 0 to 30 Torr and driving pressure (Pd) was recorded for both C and E conditions. Tracheae were found to be extremely compliant; both Si and Sc were significantly (P less than 0.005) lower after ACh administration. Resistance to airflow (R = Pd/V) was also significantly (P less than 0.05) lower after ACh administration at each compressive pressure and each flow value. These results suggest that the highly compliant preterm trachea exhibits pressure-flow characteristics similar to a Starling resistor, and the effects of compressive pressures may be attenuated by ACh-induced smooth muscle contraction. Comparison of these results with data from adult and newborn animals suggests a developmental difference in tracheal mechanics and pressure-flow relationships, as well as in the way airway function is altered by smooth muscle stimulation.\r"

Cytochrome redox state and metabolite concentrations also were compared with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for O2 (CMRo2) measured before and after CO administration. No definite biochemical evidence of energy limitation was found in parietal cortex after the fluorocarbon-for-blood exchange; however, CO had direct effects on brain metabolite concentrations. Fifteen-minute CO exposures at inspired CO/O2 of 0.003-0.06 increased cerebrocortical phosphocreatine and ADP and decreased creatine concentration. CO exposure produced no significant changes in either ATP concentration or CMRo2, although CBF increased slightly. These findings may be interpreted to indicate that CO binding to cytochrome aa3 at low CO/O2 in vivo increases extramitochondrial pH relative to that within the mitochondrial matrix. In the process, cytochrome b reduction levels increase, possibly signaling an increased efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation relative to O2 uptake by unblocked respiratory chains.\r"

We validated our model both by volume-pressure relationships of the respiratory system (Vrc-Pga and Vab-Pga, where Vrc and Vab are the rib cage and abdominal volumes, respectively) as well as electromyography of the respiratory muscles. Measurements were carried out at rest and during graded treadmill exercise in 11 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal subjects (AMNs). AMNs were 59 +/- 2 (SE) yr and had a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1.0) of 3.6 +/- 0.2 liters; COPDs were 66 +/- 2 yr and had a FEV1.0 of 1.0 +/- 0.1 liters. We noted the following. At rest, both AMNs and COPDs exhibited an increasing DIA pressure (PDIA) across inspiratory time (TI) at rest. As expired minute ventilation increased with exercise intensity, AMNs continued to maintain this PDIA ramp across inspiration; in contrast, COPDs exhibited higher values of PDIA during the first half of TI than during the second half. At all intensities of exercise, COPDs exhibited higher IAM and PER pressures than the AMNs.\r"

Plasma growth hormone concentrations at rest were similar in all four groups, but both older groups had an attenuated response to exercise. The older trained men appeared to have avoided the age-associated changes that were evident in their sedentary peers with respect to resting plasma insulin, C-peptide, and norepinephrine concentrations. Plasma glucagon concentrations were lower in both older subject groups at rest. Both sedentary groups decreased their plasma glucose concentrations and increased their plasma glucagon concentrations during exercise, whereas the trained groups had increases in their plasma glucose concentrations but had no change in their glucagon concentrations. Thus, although the concentrations of some hormones at rest and during submaximal exercise are unaffected by aging or by training, others are markedly altered by aging, training, or the interaction of the two. However, it appears that older healthy sedentary men undergo less physiological stress than young untrained men during submaximal exercise at the same relative exercise intensity, and they have no responses that would contraindicate their participation in exercise of the duration and intensity usually prescribed in exercise-training programs.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate mechanisms of platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced contraction, we studied the effect of PAF on 203 canine tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) strips from 45 dogs in vitro in the presence and absence of platelets. PAF (10(-11) to 10(-7) M) alone caused no contraction of TSM even in the presence of airway epithelium. In the presence of 2 x 10(5) platelets/microliter, PAF was an extremely potent contractile agonist (threshold 10(-11) M). This response was inhibited by the PAF antagonist, CV-3988 (10(-6) M), and reversed by the serotonin antagonist, methysergide (EC50 = 3.7 +/- 0.79 x 10(-9) M). Neither atropine nor chlorpheniramine (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) attenuated the response to PAF + platelets. In the presence of platelets, 10(-7) M PAF caused an increase in perfusate concentration of serotonin from 0.93 +/- 0.037 x 10(-8) to 1.7 +/- 0.046 x 10(-8) M (P less than 0.001). Tachyphylaxis, previously demonstrated to be irreversible, was shown to be a platelet-dependent phenomenon; contraction could be repeated in the same TSM after addition of fresh platelets. We demonstrate that PAF-induced contraction of canine TSM is caused by the release of cellular intermediates such as serotonin from platelets. We also demonstrate the site of PAF-induced tachyphylaxis in airway smooth muscle contraction.\r"

Zin was measured by applying pressure oscillations around the head to minimize the upper airway shunt and Ztr by applying pressure oscillations around the chest. Ztr was analyzed with a six-coefficient model featuring airways resistance (Raw) and inertance (Iaw), alveolar gas compressibility, and tissue resistance, inertance, and compliance. Breathing He-O2 significantly decreased Raw (1.35 +/- 0.32 vs. 1.74 +/- 0.49 cmH2O.l-1.s in air, P less than 0.01) and Iaw (0.59 +/- 0.33 vs. 1.90 +/- 0.44 x 10(-2) cmH2O.l-1.s2), but, as expected, it did not change the tissue coefficients significantly. Airways impedance was also separately computed by combining Zin and Ztr data. This approach demonstrated similar variations in Raw and Iaw with the lighter gas mixture. With both analyses, however, the changes in Iaw were more than what was expected from the change in density. This indicates that factors other than gas inertance are included in Iaw and reveals the short-comings of the six-coefficient model to interpret impedance data.\r"

  ".W": "We demonstrated spontaneous self-limited bronchoconstriction after eucapnic dry gas hyperpnea in 22 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg iv). Eucapnic hyperpnea \"challenges\" of room temperature dry or humidified gas (5% CO2-95% O2) were performed by mechanically ventilating animals (150 breaths/min, 3-6 ml tidal volume) for 5 min. During a \"recovery\" period after hyperpnea, animals were returned to standard ventilation conditions (6 ml/kg, 60 breaths/min, 50% O2 in air, fully saturated at room temperature). After dry gas hyperpnea (5 ml, 150 breaths/min), respiratory system resistance (Rrs) increased in the recovery period by 7.7-fold and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) decreased by 79.7%; changes were maximal at approximately 3 min posthyperpnea and spontaneously returned to base line in 10-40 min. This response was markedly attenuated by humidification of inspired air. Four consecutive identical dry air challenges resulted in similar posthyperpnea responses in four animals. Increasing the minute ventilation during hyperpnea (by varying tidal volume from 3 to 6 ml) caused increased bronchoconstriction in a dose-dependent fashion in six animals. Neither vagotomy nor atropine altered the airway response to dry gas hyperpnea. We conclude that dry gas hyperpnea in anesthetized guinea pigs results in a bronchoconstrictor response that shares five similar features with hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction in human asthma: 1) time course of onset and spontaneous resolution, 2) diminution with humidification of inspired gas, 3) reproducibility on consecutive identical challenges, 4) stimulus-response relationship with minute ventilation during hyperpnea, and 5) independence of parasympathetic neurotransmission.\r"

Heart rate (HR) was recorded and intraneural measurements of MSNA (right peroneal nerve) were made continuously for 2 min before (control) and during exercise at each work load. At least 2 wk later, subjects performed the same exercise bouts at which time HR was measured and a venous (forearm) blood sample was obtained for the subsequent determination of PNE by high-performance liquid chromatography. During exercise, HR increased progressively from 0 to 80 W. Neither MSNA nor PNE increased above control in response to arm cycling at 0, 10, and 20 W [0-16 +/- 1% (SE) of peak work load], but both variables increased progressively at the 40-, 60-, and 80-W (33 +/- 1 to 67 +/- 2% of peak work load) levels (all P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "A rat model of weight lifting that produces skeletal muscle enlargement utilizing regimens of resistance training similar to those employed in human training programs is described. The model consists of electrically stimulating the lower leg muscles to contract against a weighted pulley bar. Animals were subjected to training protocols employing low-frequency repetitions with high training loads within a training session. Initial maximum loads of between 200 and 800 g were progressively increased during the 16 wk of training. Work done at the end of the training period increased to an average value 66% higher than that performed at the start of training. The gastrocnemius wet weight and protein content increased (P less than 0.001) by 18 and 17%, respectively, in the stimulated loaded leg in all but one training protocol, a program in which rats were exercised more frequently. RNA content, but not concentration, was increased in the trained gastrocnemius muscle from each protocol, resulting in muscle enlargement. These data indicate that the basic model presented here provides a suitable vehicle for future studies into the biochemical events that may cause skeletal muscle enlargement during resistance training but, based on limited data, suggests that an increased frequency of training days may hinder muscle enlargement in this model.\r"

In the present study human SP-B was identified as a protein with a relative molecular weight (Mr) of 7,500-8,000 under reducing conditions; protein of Mr 18,000 was detected under nonreducing conditions by immunoblot analysis of organic extracts of bovine and human surfactant utilizing an antiserum directed against a 60-amino acid synthetic SP-B peptide. This peptide antiserum was subsequently used to identify SP-B in explant cultures of 18- to 23-wk gestation human fetal lung. Immunoprecipitation of explants labeled with [35S]methionine after 48 h of culture identified proteins of Mr 40,000-42,000, 25,000, and 18,000 after electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. The Mr 18,000 form was reduced to Mr 7,500-8,000 in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. These molecular forms likely represent the SP-B precursor protein, a proteolytic intermediate, and the mature SP-B peptide, respectively. Immunocytochemistry with the peptide antiserum localized SPL(Phe) in granular inclusions in the apical region of type II-like epithelial cells, a pattern of staining similar to that observed for the major surfactant-associated protein of Mr 26,000-38,000 (SP-A). SP-B is a novel pulmonary surfactant-associated protein that is synthesized by the human alveolar type II epithelial cell as an Mr 40,000-42,000 precursor that is subsequently proteolytically processed to Mr 7,500-8,000.\r"

After exposure of the great vessels in the thorax, blood was withdrawn from the pulmonary artery (PA), right ventricle (RV), right atrium (RA), inferior vena cava (IVC), and ascending aorta. The O2 content of these blood samples was determined by direct measurements and/or was calculated from the measured hemoglobin concentration, percent of O2 saturation, and PO2. Ventilatory rates and the inspired fraction of O2 were manipulated to vary the mixed venous O2 content (CvO2) of blood withdrawn from the PA from 1.4 to 12.9 ml O2/dl blood (vol%). Our results demonstrate that O2 contents of blood withdrawn from the PA, RV, and RA are not significantly different from one another (CPAO2 - CrvO2 = -0.02 +/- 0.25 and CPAO2 - CRAO2 = -0.07 +/- 0.41 vol%, n = 28, P greater than 0.05); however, the O2 content of blood withdrawn from the IVC is significantly lower than that withdrawn from the PA (CPAO2 - CIVCO2 = 2.11 +/- 0.34 vol%, P less than 0.001). In addition, the directly measured O2 contents were equivalent to those that were calculated. These results suggest that the O2 content of blood found in the RA and RV of the rat are indicative of the O2 content of blood found in the PA. Thus blood sampled from these areas can be used to estimate mixed venous oxygenation.\r"

Of the 12 cell lines tested, 9, derived from breast, lung, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas, were found to express both PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 genes. The levels of both PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 transcripts were superinduced when these cells were treated with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. These cells also released an activity that in studies with BALB-c/3T3 cells, inhibited binding of 125I-labeled PDGF and stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine. This stimulating activity was inhibited after reduction of the conditioned media by mercaptoethanol or after preincubation with antibodies to PDGF. Moreover, this activity was not affected by heat treatment. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that breast, lung, and gastric carcinoma cells produced PDGF-like proteins that migrated as 30- and 32-kD species under nonreducing conditions and as 15- and 16-kD species under reducing conditions. In contrast, malignant cells of ovarian origin produced 14-16-kD PDGF-like proteins that were unchanged in mobility after reduction. As PDGF receptors were not detected on these malignant epithelial cells, the production of PDGF-like proteins may affect other cells in the microenvironment by paracrine mechanisms and may contribute to excessive cell proliferation, inflammatory reactions, and connective tissue remodeling seen in certain carcinomas.\r"

In a long-term experiment, calcitonin decreased the serum cholesterol and triglycerides in uremic rats, hypothalamic obese rats, and Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. In cultured hepatocytes, calcitonin reduced the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol and triglycerides in a dose-dependent way. Treatment with W7, a calmodulin inhibitor, overcame the decrease caused by calcitonin in serum lipids in rats and in the synthesis of triglycerides from acetate or palmitate in the hepatocytes, but did not alter the intracellular cAMP level or incorporation of [32P]Pi into PI in the cells.

Rats were platelet-depleted (mean platelet less than 10,000/microliter) with goat anti-platelet IgG before induction of GN by the renal artery perfusion of concanavalin A followed by anti-concanavalin A IgG. Platelet-depletion resulted in a significant reduction in albuminuria (7 +/- 2 vs. 55 +/- 10 mg/24 h) and fractional albumin excretion (0.045 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.410 +/- 0.09) compared with controls. The decrease in albuminuria was not due to differences in blood or glomerular neutrophil counts, complement, renal function, or glomerular antibody binding. Platelet-depleted rats had equivalent subendothelial deposits and glomerular endothelial cell injury but had minimal platelet infiltrates and fibrin deposition compared with controls.

Glomerular macrophages expressed markedly augmented PCA (2.8 +/- 0.7 mU/10(3) cells) compared with blood monocytes (0.05 +/- 0.02 mU/10(3) cells) and alveolar macrophages (0.09 +/- 0.02 mU/10(3) cells) from the same rabbits. Glomerular macrophage PCA was functionally identical to the PCA of whole glomeruli, and was consistent with that of tissue factor. Supernatants from nephritic glomeruli contained IL 1 bioactivity and augmented endothelial cell PCA in vitro. However, these supernatants and purified IL 1 failed to augment the PCA of normal and macrophage-depleted nephritic glomeruli. These studies demonstrate that, in this model of anti-GBM GN, glomerular macrophages contribute directly to the augmented glomerular PCA by their expression of surface membrane PCA, and have the potential to indirectly augment glomerular PCA by their production of cytokines capable of enhancing endothelial cell PCA.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially those with active renal disease, had a marked reduction in T4+2H4+ suppressor inducer cells in their peripheral blood. However, it was puzzling to find that active SLE patients without renal diseases often had normal percentages of T4+2H4+ cells. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether active SLE patients bearing normal percentages of T4+2H4+ cells had a defect in their expression of the 2H4 molecule on T4+ cells after autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) activation. The peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 50 SLE patients with normal percentages of T4+2H4+ cells (greater than or equal to 7% in PBL) were studied and the results were compared with those of 40 normal individuals. The density of the 2H4 molecule on T4 cells from normal controls increased during the 7-d AMLR; in contrast T4 cells from patients with SLE, especially those with active SLE, had defective expression of the 2H4 antigen after AMLR activation. Patients with inactive SLE, like normals, showed an increase in the 2H4 molecule after AMLR activation. Moreover, a strong correlation was observed between percent suppression of pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven IgG synthesis and the density of the 2H4 antigen on AMLR-activated T4 cells. Serial analysis of patients with SLE showed that the density of the 2H4 antigen expression and the suppressor inducer activity of AMLR-activated T4 cells were inversely correlated with disease activity. Thus, defective expression of the 2H4 antigen may be an important mechanism for the failure of active SLE patients with normal percentages of T4+2H4+ cells to generate suppression.\r"

In conscious humans, we performed 31P-NMR on exercising forearm muscle and simultaneously recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) with microelectrodes in the peroneal nerve to determine if the activation of MSNA is coupled to muscle pH, an index of glycolysis, or to the concentrations (II) of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) which are modulators of mitochondrial respiration. During both static and rhythmic handgrip, the onset of sympathetic activation in resting muscle coincided with the development of cellular acidification in active muscle. Furthermore, increases in MSNA were correlated closely with decreases in intracellular pH but dissociated from changes in phosphocreatine [( PCr]), [Pi], and [ADP]. The principal new conclusion is that activation of muscle sympathetic outflow during exercise in humans is coupled to the cellular accumulation of protons in contracting muscle.\r"

  ".W": "An elevation in cytosolic free calcium (Cai) produced by cellular ATP depletion may contribute to the initiation of cytotoxic events in renal ischemia. To evaluate whether ATP depletion results in a rise in Cai we examined the effect of cyanide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose on the Cai of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Exposure to the metabolic inhibitors resulted in a rise in Cai from 112 +/- 11 to 649 +/- 99 nM in 15 min. This combination of metabolic inhibitors also resulted in a decrement of cell ATP to 11 +/- 2% of control by 15 min. Experiments that were performed with other metabolic inhibitors confirm that the increment in Cai is due to inhibition of ATP synthesis. With the removal of cyanide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, Cai recovered to 101 +/- 16 nM. In the absence of extracellular calcium activity (Ca0), Cai declined from 127 +/- 7 to 38 +/- 6 nM, whereas with cyanide plus 2-deoxy-D-glucose in the absence of Ca0 the Cai rose from 108 +/- 21 to 151 +/- 28 nM. Because the rise in Cai produced by ATP depletion in the absence of Ca0 is significantly less than that which occurs in the presence of Ca0, influx of Ca0 is necessary for the maximal rise of Cai. The rise in Cai that occurred in the absence of Ca0 suggests that the release of calcium from intracellular stores contributes to the increment in Cai seen with ATP depletion. TMB-8, an inhibitor of calcium release from intracellular stores, blunted the rise in Cai by nearly 50%. Neither verapamil nor nifedipine inhibited the rise in Cai. This study demonstrates that ATP depletion induced by the metabolic inhibitors cyanide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose is associated with a rapid and reversible increase in Cai. Both Ca0 influx and Cai redistribution contribute to this rise.\r"

A de novo mutation could be traced in all three families to an individual in a prior generation, confirming independent recurrence. The DNA sequence in the region of the altered Taq I site was determined in the three probands. In two unrelated male probands with neonatal onset of severe OTC deficiency, a guanine (G) to adenine (A) mutation on the sense strand (antisense cytosine [C] to thymine [T]) was found, resulting in glutamine for arginine at amino acid 109 of the mature polypeptide. In the third case, where the proband was a symptomatic female, C to T (sense strand) transition converted residue 109 to a premature stop. These results support the observation that Taq I restriction sites, which contain an internal CG, are particularly susceptible to C to T transition mutation due to deamination of a methylated C in either the sense or antisense strand. The OTC gene seems especially sensitive to C to T transition mutation at arginine codon 109 because either a nonsense mutation or an extremely deleterious missense mutation will result.\r"

The Li-loaded, Na-depleted specimens were then transferred to warm (30 degrees C) Na-Tyrode's solution. After transfer the membrane potential hyperpolarized to a level more negative than the equilibrium potential for K+. The hyperpolarization was inhibited by acetylstrophanthidin or K+-free solution indicating that it was due to current produced by the Na, K-pump responding to a Na load. This suggested that intracellular Li+ had been exchanged for Na+. The hyperpolarization was abolished by 10 microM 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride while 10 microM bumetanide had no effect, findings that are consistent with the notion that the exchange of intracellular Li+ for extracellular Na+ occurs via an operational mode of the Na-H exchanger rather than being mediated through a mechanism involving the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter.\r"

To assess the reversibility of the kinase defect in NIDDM, insulin receptor kinase activity was measured before and after weight loss in 10 NIDDM and 5 obese nondiabetic subjects. Peripheral insulin action was also assessed in vivo by glucose disposal rates (GDR) measured during a hyperinsulinemic (300 mU/M2 per min) euglycemic clamp. In the NIDDMs, insulin receptor kinase activity was reduced by 50-80% and rose to approximately 65-90% (P less than 0.01) of normal after 13.2 +/- 2.0 kg (P less than 0.01) weight loss; comparable weight loss (18.2 +/- 1.5 kg, P less than 0.01) in the nondiabetics resulted in no significant change in insulin receptor kinase activity. Relative to GDR measured in lean nondiabetics, GDR in the NIDDMs was 35% of normal initially and 67% (P less than 0.01) of normal after diet therapy; weight loss in the nondiabetics resulted in an increase in GDR from 53 to 76% of normal (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that the insulin receptor kinase defect that is present in NIDDM is largely reversible after weight reduction. In contrast, the improvement in GDR, in the absence of any change in insulin receptor kinase activity in the nondiabetics, suggests that the main cause of insulin resistance in obesity lies distal to the kinase.\r"

In 12 sheep with intact, closed thoraces, we studied the time course of pleural liquid formation after 0.12 ml/kg i.v. oleic acid. After 1 h, there were no pleural effusions, even though extravascular lung water increased 50% to 6.0 +/- 0.7 g/g dry lung. By 3 h pleural effusions had formed, they reached a maximum at 5 h (48.5 +/- 16.9 ml/thorax), and at 8 h there was no additional accumulation of pleural liquid (45.5 +/- 16.9 ml). Morphologic studies by light and electron microscopy demonstrated subpleural edema but no detectable injury to the visceral pleura, suggesting that the pleural liquid originated from the lung and not the pleura. In nine sheep, we quantified the rate of formation of pleural liquid by enclosing one lung in a plastic bag. By comparing in the same sheep the volume of pleural liquid collected from the enclosed lung to the volume found in the opposite intact chest, we estimated the rate of liquid absorption from the intact chest to be 0.32 ml/(kg.h); we had previously reported a liquid absorption rate of 0.28 ml/(kg.h) in normal sheep. These studies also supported the conclusion that the majority of the pleural liquid originated from the lung because we could account for all of the pleural liquid that was formed and cleared. The volume of pleural liquid collected from the enclosed lungs was equal to 21% of the excess lung liquid that formed after oleic acid-induced lung injury. Thus, the pleural space and parietal pleural lymphatic pathways are important pathways for the clearance of pulmonary edema liquid after experimentally induced increased permeability pulmonary edema.\r"

BCECF was calibrated intracellularly, demonstrating similar pH-sensitivity of the dye in control and acidotic animals. In subsequent studies, lumen and peritubular capillaries were perfused to examine Na/H and Na(HCO3)3 transporter activity in the absence of contact with native fluid. The initial rate of change in cell pH (dpHi/dt) was 97, 50, and 44% faster in tubules from acidotic animals when peritubular [HCO3] was changed from 25 to 10 mM in the presence or absence of chloride, or peritubular [Na] was changed from 147 to 50 mM, respectively. dpHi/dt was 57% faster in tubules from acidotic animals when luminal [Na] was changed from 152 to 0 mM. Buffer capacities, measured using NH3/NH+4 addition, were similar in the two groups. The results demonstrate that chronic metabolic acidosis causes an adaptation in the intrinsic properties of both the apical membrane Na/H antiporter and basolateral membrane Na(HCO3)3 symporter.\r"

The antibody stains neutrophils and a subpopulation of monocytes in blood smears and neutrophil precursors in bone marrow smears, and gives positive reactions with the cell lines HL60 and U-937. It labelled the blast cells in 68% of cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (M1-M5) but was unreactive with all cases of lymphoid leukaemias. Most of the elastase negative myeloid leukaemias were labelled by monoclonal anti-myeloperoxidase (antibody MPO-7) as were cells from the promyelocytic line HL60. No cases of myeloid leukaemia showed the opposite pattern--that is elastase positive, myeloperoxidase negative, suggesting that the production of myeloperoxidase precedes the onset of elastase synthesis during myeloid maturation. The anti-elastase antibody NP57 is a useful addition to the range of monoclonal antibodies available for the differential diagnosis of acute leukaemia by alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) labelling of cell smears; it may also be of value for the histopathological diagnosis of tumour deposits in myeloid leukaemia and for the detection of neutrophils in paraffin sections.\r"

The tumour cell membranes of the renal carcinomas stained strongly with epithelial membrane antigen (EMA); membrane staining was totally absent in the haemangioblastomas. Strong neurone specific enolase (NSE) and S100 staining were also seen in haemangioblastomas but were more variable than EMA staining in renal carcinomas.

Cases with a high proliferative index (greater than or equal to 18%) or DNA aneuploidy showed significantly poorer survival than those with a low proliferative index (less than 18%). A high mitotic count was also associated with a poor prognosis. On multiple regression analysis the flow cytometric assessments and mitotic counts were significant predictors of survival. Assessments of proliferative activity clearly have prognostic potential in centroblastic-centrocytic lymphoma and may permit more accurate characterisation of individual tumours.\r"

No correlation was observed between the degree of staining and prognosis even when the subcellular distribution of antigen expression was assessed. The total absence of staining with HMFG1 was possibly associated with a favourable outcome, although this did not quite achieve significance with the small numbers involved. The Quantimet 970 was used for objective semiautomated measurement of immunohistochemical reactions in paraffin wax sections and was found to produce better resolution and to eliminate subjective error.\r"

Sections were cut at 5 micron, mounted on to glass slides, and dried overnight at 37 degrees C before staining for alkaline phosphatase activity by the indoxyl phosphatase nitro blue tetrazolium method. Incubation periods amounted to 10 minutes for biopsy specimens and 30 minutes to one hour for necropsy samples. The demonstration of alkaline phosphatase activity in routinely processed biopsy specimens provides an effective, quick, and definitive test in the diagnosis of microvillus inclusion disease without recourse to electron microscopy.\r"

Biopsy specimens taken at the time of diagnosis were studied in 20; after adhering to a gluten free diet for nine to 19 (mean 14) months in 14; and after adhering to the same diet for 24-48 (mean 34) months in 10 patients. Histological recovery was assessed morphometrically in the proximal jejunum. Mucosal linings significantly improved over time, but did not completely return to normal with a gluten free diet: at diagnosis the surface: volume ratio was 22% of normal, increasing to 48% and 66% after nine to 19 and 24-48 months, respectively, of a gluten free diet. Disaccharidase activities progressively increased. After 24-48 months maltase, sucrase, and isomaltase had returned to normal in the proximal jejunum; they were still significantly decreased in the distal duodenum. Duodenal and jejunal lactase activities were both below normal after 24 to 48 months. It is concluded that recovery of the intestinal mucosa of adults with gluten sensitive enteropathy during a gluten free diet continues beyond nine to 19 months and is still incomplete after two to four years. The recovery of disaccharidase activities extends from the distal to the proximal part of the small intestine, and is aligned to histological recovery.\r"

Mild muscular weakness was detected in one of these three. The levels of serum muscle enzymes were within the normal range in all patients. Results suggest that etretinate may cause subclinical muscle damage. In view of our results and previous reports, it seems that neuromuscular evaluation should be part of the routine follow-up of patients receiving long-term therapy with etretinate.\r"

However, there is little agreement in the literature on the effect of this drug on the tears. Because we have previously shown that the lacrimal gland secretes isotretinoin, we conducted a study of the effect of isotretinoin on lacrimal gland function. Rabbits were treated with isotretinoin for 5 months. Throughout the study tear secretion was monitored by the Schirmer test. At the end of the study lacrimal gland function was assessed by measurement of fluid and protein secretion rates and secretion of retinol in response to a pilocarpine stimulus. Lacrimal gland function was not affected by isotretinoin as compared with a group of age-matched control rabbits; however, Schirmer test scores were significantly increased in the treated animals as compared with control values. We conclude that isotretinoin is not toxic to the lacrimal gland of rabbits. This suggests that ocular irritation in patients treated with isotretinoin is not caused by decreased tear secretion during therapy.\r"

The provocation threshold (the lowest amount of nickel producing a reaction) varied from 5.2 mg (2.5%) to 0.47 microgram (0.01%) when tested in petrolatum. The provocation threshold was higher with aqueous solutions. The lowest provocation threshold in a statistically significant number of individuals was 1.5 micrograms. Nickel bioavailability from dermatitis-inducing earrings and a necklace was determined by immersing them in plasma, normal saline solution, and synthetic sweat at different pH values over 7 days. Nickel leaching under these conditions exceeded the provocation threshold 1.4- to 93-fold, depending on object and solution. The time course varied with solution. After leaching, surface nickel was measured by the action of dilute nitric acid and total nickel was determined by complete dissolution in aqua regia. Nickel was more bioavailable from earrings than from the necklace, presumably reflecting different metallurgy. Plasma was the most effective solution for removing available nickel from earrings, a possible explanation for the frequent induction of sensitization by ear piercing. Comparison of provocation threshold and leaching results may help determine risks from consumer products.\r"

Kaposi's sarcoma, multidermatomal, necrotic herpes zoster, and pruritic maculopapular rashes are common cutaneous manifestations of AIDS and its related complex (ARC) in Zambia. The maculopapular rash results from a lymphoplasmacytic angiitis in the dermis, possibly in response to the presence of HIV in the dermis. Candidiasis, severe genital herpes, extensive molluscum contagiosum, and tinea corporis were less frequent and usually refractory to treatment. Drug reactions are also frequent in Zambians with AIDS. In seven patients given streptomycin, thiacetazone, and rifampicin for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurred shortly after therapy was begun, and two died despite high-dose prednisone and discontinuance of tuberculosis therapy. Extensive seborrheic dermatitis refractory to topical fluorinated corticosteroids is also an associated condition in AIDS patients who have pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "175 patients with severe psoriasis of different types were treated with 10, 25, or 50 mg acitretin and compared with patients receiving 50 mg etretinate over a period of 8 weeks in a randomized, double-blind multicenter study in the Federal Republic of Germany. Plasma concentrations of etretinate and its metabolite acitretin were measured during therapy and also 3 weeks after cessation of treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, a trend toward clinical improvement was shown in all groups with increasing dosage. Those groups receiving the lower acitretin doses (i.e., 10 and 25 mg/day) had more dropouts than the groups taking 50 mg acitretin or 50 mg etretinate. Complete remissions before the end of therapy occurred only among those receiving higher doses. Enlargement of psoriatic lesions, however, could be observed during treatment with both retinoids, despite improvement of other parameters, as measured by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and psoriasis severity index (PSI). After 8 weeks, a significant improvement was calculated by the PASI score and by a newly defined, corrected PASI score for all four dose regimens compared with baseline levels. A greater than 50% PSI score improvement was seen in 50% of patients treated with 10 mg acitretin, 40.5% with 25 mg acitretin, 53.8% with 50 mg acitretin, and 61.1% with 50 mg etretinate. No statistical differences were found among these groups at any time during the 8-week period. No new or unexpected side effects occurred during acitretin treatment. Moreover, cholesterol levels did not significantly change. Three weeks after cessation of drug administration, the plasma concentrations of acitretin were below the sensitivity level of the assay, whereas etretinate was still quantifiable. It is interesting that acitretin plasma concentrations during therapy with 50 mg acitretin were markedly lower (means = 18 ng/ml) than were acitretin levels during treatment with 50 mg etretinate (means = 36 ng/ml).\r"

Longer exposure to fluorescent light did not result in further breakdown, and the final breakdown of both preparations was similar. A 12-week, double-blind clinical trial comparing isotretinoin (0.05%) with tretinoin (0.05%) applied topically to patients with moderate acne was carried out. Both preparations caused significant reductions in papules and pustules. However, neither treatment was significantly superior to the other in the reduction of acne lesions. This may be because both preparations are rapidly broken down to similar products when exposed to fluorescent light.\r"

These samples are preserved with potassium dichromate for transport from the farm to the laboratory. A survey of the laboratory was conducted and workers were interviewed. Eight of 16 subjects reported a history of occupationally exacerbated hand dermatitis. Three of 16 subjects had positive patch test results to potassium dichromate. Two of 15 subjects who underwent patch testing to milk preserved with potassium dichromate had positive reactions. None reacted to milk alone, bronopol, or Kathon CG. Two workers are receiving workers' compensation because of severe allergic contact dermatitis of the hands to potassium dichromate. We conclude that milk testing laboratory workers are at substantial risk for acquiring allergic contact dermatitis from milk preserved with potassium dichromate.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2-D3) on cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes from patients with psoriasis and treated 17 patients with psoriasis with orally or topically administered 1,25-(OH)2-D3. Cultured fibroblasts from three of five patients showed a normal response to the antiproliferative activity of a physiologic dose of 1,25-(OH)2-D3, whereas fibroblasts from the other two had a partial resistance to the drug. Cultured keratinocytes from two patients with psoriasis possessed nuclear receptors for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 and the drug caused a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and induction of terminal differentiation of these cells similar to effects in normal cultured keratinocytes. Ten of 14 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who received oral 1,25-(OH)2-D3 showed significant clearing of their hyperkeratotic plaques. Three patients had complete clearing that was sustained with maintenance therapy, but four patients received little or no benefit from the therapy. By the administration of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 as a single oral dose at bedtime, larger doses of the drug could be tolerated without evidence of hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia. Three patients who received topical 1,25-(OH)2-D3 showed a rapid response with complete clearing after 6 weeks of therapy. Therefore, these preliminary findings suggest that orally or topically administered 1,25-(OH)2-D3 may be a safe and effective alternative therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.\r"

Results showed that the majority prefer the traditional electrosurgical units, with the Hyfrecator (Birtcher Corp.) being by far the most popular. The most common forms of high-frequency electrosurgery are electrocoagulation and electrodesiccation. Very few dermatologists use cutting current, although many own machines with this capability. The majority do not use a strict sterile technic when performing electrosurgery. However, there appears to be an increasing awareness of contamination risks, and many dermatologists have started using disposable or sterilizable treatment electrodes. High-frequency electrosurgery is by far the most common method of electrosurgery. Electrocautery and surgical galvanism are very rarely used.\r"

Histologically it is a noncircumscribed vascular proliferation that may extend into the subcutaneous tissue. The earliest finding appears to be a superficial proliferation of ectatic dermal vascular lumina with intraluminal papillary projections. The endothelial cells are flat or conspicuously epithelioid with solid intraluminal projections. The deeper component is composed of angular, lymphatic-like lumina that concentrate around sweat gland coils, often making small hemangiomatous nodules. Extensive red cell extravasation, inflammatory aggregates, and fibrin thrombi are present. In later stages there is extensive stromal hemosiderin deposition. The endothelial cells are weakly positive for factor VIII-related antigen and strongly positive for Ulex europaeus 1 lectin. The lesion appears to be persistent but self-limited. While appearing clinically benign, it exhibits worrisome histologic features. The nosologic designation of this lesion is uncertain, but it shares certain morphologic features with epithelioid (histiocytoid) hemangioma and progressive lymphangioma. It also poses serious differential diagnostic problems with the early phases of Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

  ".U": "89009275\r", 
  ".W": "Forty consecutive patients with creatine kinase-MB confirmed myocardial infarction due to circumflex artery occlusion (Group 1) were prospectively evaluated and compared with 107 patients with infarction due to right coronary artery occlusion (Group 2) and 94 with left anterior descending artery occlusion (Group 3). All 241 patients underwent exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy, radionuclide ventriculography, 24 h Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and coronary arteriography before hospital discharge and were followed up for 39 +/- 18 months. There were no significant differences among the three infarct groups in age, gender, number of risk factors, prevalence and type of prior infarction, Norris index, Killip class and frequency of in-hospital complications. Acute ST segment elevation was present in only 48% of patients in Group 1 versus 71 and 72% in Groups 2 and 3, respectively (p = 0.012), and 38% of patients with a circumflex artery-related infarct had no significant ST changes (that is, elevation or depression) on admission (versus 21 and 20% for patients in Groups 2 and 3, respectively) (p = 0.001). Abnormal R waves in lead V1 were more common in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p less than 0.003) as was ST elevation in leads I, aVL and V4 to V6 (p less than or equal to 0.048). These differences in ECG findings between Group 1 and 2 patients correlated with a significantly higher prevalence of posterior and lateral wall asynergy in the group with a circumflex artery-related infarct. Infarct size based on peak creatine kinase levels and multiple radionuclide variables was intermediate in Group 1 compared with that in Group 2 (smallest) and Group 3 (largest). During long-term follow-up, the probability of recurrent cardiac events was similar in the three infarct groups. When patients with a circumflex artery-related infarct were stratified according to the presence or absence of abnormal R waves in lead V1 or V2, the abnormal R wave group had more admission ST elevation (p = 0.025), a larger infarct (p less than 0.05) and more extensive coronary artery disease (p = 0.027). In fact, all patients with a circumflex artery-related infarct and an abnormal R wave in lead V1 had multivessel disease. An abnormal R wave in lead V1 had a 96% specificity for circumflex versus right coronary artery-related infarction but a sensitivity of only 21%. Discriminate function analysis of all admission historical and ECG variables identified inferior and lateral ST elevation as independent predictors of circumflex artery-related infarction...\r"

  ".W": "The relation of silent ischemia in patients with stable angina to known predictors of severity of coronary disease on exercise stress testing and coronary angiography is poorly defined. This issue was therefore examined with use of Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, treadmill exercise tests and angiographic indexes in 102 patients (not taking antianginal therapy) and the results were compared with Holter and treadmill findings in 42 volunteers. A total of 159 ischemic episodes (90% silent) were identified during 2,503 h on Holter recording in 97 patients (mean duration per episode 22.7 +/- 147 min; range 1 to 234). Holter recordings had a 92% specificity and an 80% positive predictive value, but a sensitivity of only 37% and a negative predictive value of 27% for coronary disease. Sixty-three patients (Group I) had no ischemia on Holter recording, 22 (Group II) had a cumulative duration of 1 to 60 min/24 h and in 12 (Group III) ischemia exceeded 60 min/24 h. There was no significant correlation between cumulative ischemia duration on Holter recording and exercise duration or time to ST segment depression on treadmill exercise. In general, the greater the number of coronary vessels involved and the higher the proximal coronary artery stenosis score, the greater the likelihood of ischemia and the longer the cumulative ischemia duration on Holter recording. Irrespective of the severity of coronary disease, in about 25% of Holter recordings in each angiographic category there were no ischemic episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Symptom-limited bicycle exercise and thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy were performed after intravenous administration of 0.27 mmol/kg body weight of magnesium sulfate and after placebo on different days. In all patients, serum magnesium levels after administration of magnesium sulfate were about twofold higher than levels after placebo. Exercise-induced angina associated with transient ST segment elevation occurred in 11 patients with variant angina receiving placebo and in only 2 of these patients receiving magnesium (p less than 0.005). On the other hand, exercise-induced angina was not suppressed by magnesium in any patient with stable effort angina. In these patients there was no significant difference in exercise duration after administration of placebo versus after administration of magnesium. The size of the perfusion defect as measured by thallium-201 scintigraphy was significantly less in patients with variant angina receiving magnesium than that in those receiving placebo (p less than 0.001), whereas it was not significantly different in patients with stable effort angina receiving placebo versus magnesium. In conclusion, exercise-induced angina is suppressed by intravenous magnesium in patients with variant angina but not in patients with stable effort angina. This beneficial effect of magnesium in patients with variant angina is most likely due to improvement of regional myocardial blood flow by suppression of coronary artery spasm.\r"

Transient abnormal wall motion (asynergy) confined to one coronary artery region was found in 18 of the 27 patients and transient abnormal motion extending over more than one coronary artery region in the remaining 9 patients. Spasm of more than one major coronary artery was demonstrated separately by coronary arteriography during an attack induced by injection of acetylcholine or ergonovine in seven of the nine patients who manifested asynergy in more than one coronary artery region. In one patient, spasm was demonstrated in one major coronary artery, and the other coronary arteries were severely stenosed or occluded organically. In the remaining patient, acetylcholine was not injected into both arteries; however, the attack was sometimes associated with ST segment elevation in the anterior leads and at other times in the inferior leads. Therefore, simultaneous multivessel coronary spasm seems to have occurred in eight of the nine patients who exhibited asynergy in more than one coronary artery region. The 8 patients with simultaneous multivessel coronary spasm had a higher degree and longer duration of ST segment elevation and a higher incidence of arrhythmias during the attack induced by hyperventilation than did the 19 patients with single vessel coronary spasm, and all of them had no significant organic stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From a cohort of patients referred for elective transluminal coronary angioplasty, a subset of patients was evaluated to determine whether revascularization using coronary angioplasty could salvage chronically ischemic myocardium. Reversible chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction was identified by a severe wall motion abnormality at rest and at least one of the following: 1) persistent angina pectoris; 2) postextrasystolic ventricular contraction potentiation of motion in the asynergic zone on baseline ventriculogram; and 3) thallium-201 uptake in the asynergic zone. Twelve patients were identified as having reversible chronic ischemia and underwent coronary angioplasty. Their mean age was 63 +/- 11 years and duration of symptoms 8.3 +/- 9.7 weeks. Immediate pre- and postangioplasty left ventriculograms were obtained. Regional wall motion was analyzed using a radial axis model, and global ejection fraction was calculated. After angioplasty, tension development (heart rate-systolic pressure product) increased in the absence of an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Global ejection fraction increased from 46 +/- 20 to 62 +/- 19% (p less than 0.005). The percent of left ventricular diastolic perimeter showing asynergy decreased from 29 +/- 11 to 10 +/- 13% (p less than 0.005). During follow-up ranging from 6 to 51 months, sudden death occurred in one patient who had had no improvement in wall motion after angioplasty, repeat angioplasty was performed in three patients and eight patients remained asymptomatic. Application of easily obtainable clinical data identifies a subset of patients with chronically ischemic myocardium. Coronary angioplasty in such patients is useful in salvaging hibernating myocardium.\r"

Previous coronary artery bypass surgery was performed at a mean of 29.8 months (range 2 to 199) in group 1 and 51.3 months (range 2 to 134) in group 2. Sixteen (62%) of 26 patients in group 1 and 17 (71%) of 24 patients in group 2 had multivessel angioplasty; multilesion angioplasty was performed in 20 patients (77%) in group 1 and in 19 patients (79%) in group 2. Within group 1, 12 (37.5%) of 32 lesions were in the body of the internal mammary artery graft and 20 lesions (62.5%) occurred at the distal anastomosis. Angioplasty was successful in 30 (94%) of 32 attempts in group 1 and in 25 (96%) of 26 attempts in group 2. Procedure-related complications were limited to emergent bypass surgery in one patient in group 2. At a mean follow-up period of 12.7 months in group 1 and 18.2 months in group 2, 39 (90%) of the 45 patients had no or only mild angina. There were two late cardiac deaths (mortality rate 4.9%) in the 41 patients with successful angioplasty. The results of this study demonstrate that percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of internal mammary artery grafts combined with multilesion angioplasty is technically feasible, can be performed with a high primary success rate and a low incidence of complications and achieves sustained clinical improvement in the majority of patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of isometric exercise on regional left ventricular mechanical function and regional coronary blood flow were evaluated in 17 patients with significant proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 10 patients with normal coronary arteriograms. All patients had normal myocardial contractility in the basal condition. All performed isometric handgrip exercise at 50% of the maximal voluntary contraction for 3 min during two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring and hemodynamic evaluation of great cardiac vein flow by thermodilution technique. During isometric exercise, 7 of the 17 patients with left anterior descending coronary stenosis developed asynergy in the anterior territory (anterior or septal segment, or both) (group I); the remaining 10 showed normal myocardial contraction during the test (group II). The 10 normal subjects manifested no regional asynergy during the test (control group). The increase in great cardiac vein flow at peak isometric exercise was significantly smaller (p less than 0.01) in group I (+15 +/- 8%) than that in group II (+98 +/- 48%) and the control group (+64 +/- 22%). Anterior coronary vascular resistance decreased in group II (-32 +/- 13%) and in the control group (-25 +/- 8%) but increased in group I (+6 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01 versus group II and control group). These data demonstrate that handgrip-induced myocardial asynergy is associated, in our study patients, with an abnormal response of the regional coronary circulation. The increase in coronary vascular resistance in group I patients with asynergy demonstrates that functional mechanisms play a dominant role in left ventricular mechanical dysfunction induced by isometric exercise.\r"

Seventy-two subjects from nine families were studied. Sixteen died at a young age and 56 are living. Postmortem investigation in 11 cases (mean age at death 24 years) revealed massive replacement of the right ventricular free wall by fat or fibrous tissue. In the 56 living patients clinical examination included an electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest, ambulatory ECG recording, posteroanterior and lateral chest roentgenograms, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiograms and exercise stress tests. In 14 patients, hemodynamic, angiographic and electrophysiologic studies were also carried out; right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed in four. Structural and dynamic right ventricular impairment was detected in 30 living patients (mean age 25 years), and concomitant mild left ventricular abnormalities were present in 4. In eight of the nine families studied at least two members were affected. Ventricular arrhythmias (Lown grade greater than or equal to 4a) were recorded in more than half of the cases. The data reveal that right ventricular dysplasia shows a familial clustering and causes electrical instability that may place affected subjects at risk of sudden death. The mean age of these subjects suggests that the disease is manifested at a young age with a polymorphic clinical and arrhythmic profile. Finally, because this disease is a primary disorder of the ventricular myocardium, it should be included among the cardiomyopathies.\r"

Age, peak left ventricular systolic pressure, end-diastolic pressure, ejection fraction and cardiac index did not differ significantly between groups. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume for the atrial septal defect group was significantly less than that for the control group (mean +/- SD, 61 +/- 9 ml/m2 versus 73 +/- 13, p less than 0.05) in keeping with previous studies. The slope of the log pressure-volume relation was significantly greater in the group with atrial septal defect than in the normal group (0.056 +/- 0.010 versus 0.044 +/- 0.008, p less than 0.01), consistent with increased chamber stiffness.

  ".W": "To further evaluate the reported interaction in animals and humans between cardiopulmonary baroreflexes and the somatic pressor reflex, studies were performed in 16 normal men using direct measurements of efferent sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (microneurography) during sustained isometric handgrip (30% maximal voluntary contraction). Forearm vasoconstrictor (plethysmography) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity responses to sustained handgrip were measured during cardiopulmonary baroreceptor deactivation (lower body negative pressure, n = 8) and activation (volume expansion, n = 8). In addition, responses to posthandgrip muscle ischemia were studied during these perturbations of cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. No evidence of an interaction between these two reflex pathways was found. When handgrip was performed during lower body negative pressure, the percent increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (+115 +/- 17%) was not different from the sum of the individual sympathetic responses to handgrip and lower body negative pressure performed separately (+106 +/- 19%, p = NS). Likewise, the change in forearm vascular resistance (+3.9 +/- 0.8 U) for sustained handgrip performed during lower body negative pressure was not different from the algebraic sum of the responses to handgrip and lower body negative pressure when these were performed separately (+4.7 +/- 2.7 U, p = NS). No difference was noted in forearm vasoconstrictor and sympathetic nerve activity responses to posthandgrip muscle ischemia and lower body negative pressure when these were performed alone or in combination. Volume expansion also failed to uncover an inhibitory interaction. Handgrip performed before volume expansion resulted in forearm vascular resistance responses (-1.2 +/- 0.9 U) that were not different from the responses when such handgrip was performed after volume infusion (+0.9 +/- 0.9 U, p = NS). Rather than producing the predicted inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity responses to sustained handgrip, volume infusion actually increased these responses. During prevolume sustained handgrip, the increase in sympathetic nerve activity (+64.5 +/- 15.7%) was significantly less than the increase when handgrip was performed after volume infusion (+105.6 +/- 20.1%, p less than 0.01). A similar lack of inhibitory modulation was seen during posthandgrip muscle ischemia performed before and after volume expansion. These data indicate that the efferent sympathetic responses to the somatic pressor reflex are not modulated by the cardiopulmonary baroreflexes in normal humans.\r"

Three patients were without cardiac disease and 28 had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with various degrees of left ventricular dysfunction. The qualitatively assessed myocardial I-123 MIBG scintigrams and the myocardial versus mediastinal I-123 MIBG uptake ratio were related to I-123 MIBG activity and norepinephrine concentration determined from endomyocardial biopsy samples taken from the right side of the interventricular septum. Scintigrams and the MIBG uptake ratio were also related to plasma catecholamine concentrations, left ventricular ejection fraction and New York Heart Association functional class. Patients with distinct myocardial I-123 MIBG uptake (score 1) had a normal ejection fraction (58 +/- 16%). Patients with diffusely reduced uptake or scintigraphic defects (score 2) had a significantly lower ejection fraction (38 +/- 9%, p less than 0.05), whereas patients with shadowy or no visible myocardial uptake (score 3) had the lowest ejection fraction (23 +/- 6%, p less than 0.002 versus patients with score 2). The scintigraphically determined I-123 MIBG activity in the septal region correlated significantly with I-123 MIBG activity from the endomyocardial biopsy samples (r = 0.78, p less than 0.001, n = 9). The myocardial versus mediastinal I-123 MIBG activity ratio was significantly related to myocardial norepinephrine concentration (r = 0.63, n = 28) and to left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.74, n = 31). These data suggest that myocardial I-123 MIBG scintigraphy is a useful noninvasive method for the assessment of myocardial adrenergic nervous system disintegrity in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

The hypothesis of this study was that for equivalent efficacy rates, a current-based defibrillation method would result in delivering less energy and peak current than would the standard energy-based method. In a group of 86 consecutive patients with ventricular fibrillation, every other patient was prospectively assigned to receive shocks according to method 1 or method 2. Method 1 was current based and delivered successive shocks of 25, 25 and a maximum of 40 A; method 2 was energy based and delivered shocks of 200, 200 and 360 joules. Patients in both groups were similar with respect to age, gender, weight, cardiac diagnosis, ejection fraction, antiarrhythmic therapy, chest circumference, chest depth and transthoracic impedance. Each method had statistically equivalent first shock (79% current-based versus 81% energy-based) and cumulative shock success rates. The mean first shock energy was 120 +/- 30 joules for patients receiving the current-based method and 200 joules for patients receiving energy-based shocks (p = 0.0001). The mean peak current was 24 +/- 2.3 and 33 +/- 5.0 A, respectively (p = 0.0001). Therefore, for equivalent first shock success rates, the energy-based method delivered 67% more energy and 38% more current than the current-based method. High transthoracic impedance (greater than or equal to 90 omega) predicted first shock failure only in patients undergoing defibrillation by the energy-based method (p = 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Irregularity of the ventricular rhythm is a hallmark of patients with atrial fibrillation, yet the genesis of the irregularity is not yet fully understood. The role of the atrioventricular (AV) node in determining the irregularity of the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation was investigated by comparing the frequency distributions of the atrial (AA) and the ventricular (RR) intervals. Atrial electrograms and surface electrocardiographic leads were recorded during sustained atrial fibrillation in 12 patients with conduction over the AV node. The scaling factor (mean RR interval/mean AA interval) quantified the ability of the conduction pathway to scale the atrial input to a slower ventricular response and ranged from 2.55 to 5.92 (mean +/- SD 3.77 +/- 0.92). The coefficient of variation (SD/mean) measured the relative variability of the AA and RR interval distributions. The atrial and ventricular coefficients of variation were not significantly different (0.20 +/- 0.04 versus 0.21 +/- 0.03, p greater than 0.27). Similar recordings were analyzed in six patients with conduction over a accessory AV pathway. The scaling factor ranged from 1.54 to 2.46 (2.02 +/- 0.39) and, as was the case for patients with conduction over the AV node, the atrial and ventricular coefficients of variation did not significantly differ (0.24 +/- 0.08 versus 0.27 +/- 0.10, p greater than 0.6). For both groups of patients, ventricular variability and the maximal RR intervals were predicted by the product of the scaling factor and either atrial variability or maximal AA intervals, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the actual prevalence of hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes, and the awareness of these coronary risk factors in unaffected family members, 150 apparently coronary disease-free siblings of 86 people who had documented coronary disease before 60 years of age were studied. All subjects participated in a 1 day screening preceded by a self-administered risk factor questionnaire and a personal interview. Participation of both the index patients and siblings exceeded 86%. With the use of nationally established recommendations for blood pressure and lipids, which are based on coronary disease risk curves, screening revealed that 48% of brothers and 41% of sisters were hypertensive, 45% of brothers and 22% of sisters had a lipid abnormality, 38% of siblings were current cigarette smokers and 4.7% were diabetic. Two or more risk factors were present in 42% of brothers and 26% of sisters. More than 75% of siblings had one or more risk factors that would require intervention.

The severity of aortic regurgitation was evaluated by radionuclide angiographic measurement of the stroke volume index a mean of 47.1 months postoperatively. The stroke volume index was defined as the ratio of the stroke counts between the left and right ventricles. A value greater than 1.8 was considered to indicate significant left ventricular volume overload. Eight patients (40%) were shown to have various degrees of aortic regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography or cardiac catheterization, or both. The mean (+/- SD) stroke volume index was 1.03 +/- 0.15 in these patients and 1.01 +/- 0.21 in the 12 patients without aortic regurgitation (p = NS). The stroke volume index was not above the normal range in any patient, indicating that the degree of aortic regurgitation present was trivial. This medium-term study indicates that trivial or mild aortic regurgitation is a frequent finding after anatomic correction of transposition of the great arteries. However, it rarely results in an audible cardiac murmur or significant left ventricular volume overload. Long-term evaluation is required to determine its importance.\r"

Direct visualization of the ductus was achieved in all patients. All ductal flow was shunting left to right from the descending aorta to the pulmonary artery even in the presence of significant elevation of pulmonary artery pressure. However, transient bidirectional shunting was observed in two patients on serial studies. Disturbed systolic and diastolic flows were demonstrated within the ductus in each case. The blood flows in the main pulmonary artery consisted of three distinguishable areas: 1) a characteristic high velocity turbulent retrograde ductal jet throughout the entire cardiac cycle, located in the anterolateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery; 2) nonspecific low velocity retrograde late systolic and early diastolic flow, located in the posteromedial aspect of the main pulmonary artery; and 3) low velocity forward systolic and diastolic flow, occupying the remaining area of the pulmonary artery. The blood flows in the descending aorta near the ductal orifice consisted of disturbed systolic and diastolic flows in a reversed direction. By providing detailed real time blood flow information with simultaneous imaging of the ductus, Doppler color flow mapping greatly facilitates the detection of a small ductal shunt. This technique also allows detection of a bidirectional or right to left ductal shunt.\r"

Rats with either aortic banding or a sham operation and a survival period of 3 weeks were further randomized to sham thoracotomy or left coronary ligation. Surviving rats were killed 7 days later and the hearts were fixed in diastole for morphologic analysis. Hearts with aortic banding had a mean peak to peak gradient of 20.7 +/- 4.9 mm Hg across the aortic band at death and a significantly thicker heart than that of the comparison group without an aortic band. Infarct size, as a percent of total left ventricular mass, at the time of death was less in the group with aortic banding, yet infarct expansion was more marked. However, when original infarct size was estimated taking into account the effects of aortic banding, scar formation, infarct expansion and infarct-induced hypertrophy, it was found to be similar in both infarct groups (45.50 +/- 4.2 versus 47.90 +/- 3.1%).

The diastolic filling pattern superficially resembles that which is seen with constrictive pericarditis. To examine potential mechanisms for these clinical findings, a model of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction was produced in seven dogs by repeated coronary microsphere embolization, producing a dilated left ventricle with reduced systolic function. Measurements of left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures, rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) and echocardiographic end-diastolic and end-systolic areas were obtained at baseline, during intermediate embolization (moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, dilation and mild increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure), postembolization (further embolization resulting in severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, dilation and marked increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure), after thoracotomy and after pericardiectomy. The filling fraction at 1/3 and 1/2 of diastole and the time constant of left ventricular pressure decline were also determined. Repetitive coronary microembolization caused progressive left ventricular dilation and decreasing systolic function, which did not change after opening the chest or pericardium. The filling fraction at 1/3 and 1/2 of diastole declined with intermediate embolization (12.0 +/- 5.6% and 23.1 +/- 10.8%, respectively) as compared with baseline values (29.0 +/- 11.9%, 42.9 +/- 15.6%, p less than 0.05). After embolization, there was an increase in the 1/3 and the 1/2 filling fraction (47.5 +/- 8.9%, 72.0 +/- 6.0%, respectively, p less than 0.01) as compared with baseline values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, variations in sample location relative to the arterial wall and valve have been thought to affect pulmonary artery velocity and acceleration measurements clinically. Therefore, pulsed Doppler and color flow mapping were performed in a pulsatile flow apparatus connected to a glass or Plexiglas model of the main pulmonary artery and its bifurcation, which contained a Hancock 29 mm pericardial tissue valve (5.35 cm2 orifice). Doppler sample volumes were placed at four sites: 1) at the pulmonary valve leaflet tips, centrally; 2) 2 cm distal to the leaflet tips, centrally; 3) 2 cm distal but laterally near the pulmonary artery wall; and 4) at the pulmonary artery bifurcation, centrally. Doppler peak flow velocity and acceleration time were measured. There was no difference between sites 1 and 2 in peak flow velocity or acceleration time. At site 3, peak flow velocity and acceleration time were both less than at site 1 (mean +/- SD, 85 +/- 44 versus 105 +/- 39 cm/s, p less than 0.005, and 162 +/- 65 versus 188 +/- 46 ms, p less than 0.03, respectively). Moreover, the pulmonary artery velocity contour at site 3 exhibited increased spectral dispersion and notching and increased variance on the color spectrum. At site 4, peak flow velocity was less than at site 1 (85 +/- 31 versus 105 +/- 39 cm/s, p less than 0.005), whereas pulmonary artery acceleration time was not significantly different. In this model, Doppler pulmonary artery flow velocity was best recorded within 2 cm of the valve and in the center of the vessel. Similar studies should be performed in the human pulmonary artery to standardize the recording technique and sample sites for Doppler measurements of velocity and acceleration.\r"

Severe coronary spasm was documented angiographically in all patients after angioplasty and resulted in symptomatic and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia. Multiple sites of spasm were present in the dilated vessel in three patients. Coronary artery spasm persisted despite the infusion of large doses of intracoronary nitroglycerin (200 to 2,000 micrograms, mean 850 micrograms) over 10 min. Administration of intracoronary verapamil (1 to 1.5 mg over 10 min) resulted in complete relief of spasm with restoration of brisk anterograde flow in all patients.

  ".W": "A collaborative study was carried out to assess the suitability of a chosen preparation to serve as the international standard (IS) for dog (Canis domesticus) hair/dander extract. Sets of five coded preparations of dog extract, including the proposed IS, were delivered to each participating laboratory in glass-sealed ampules. Fifteen laboratories in nine different countries examined the preparations by RAST inhibition, crossed immunoelectrophoresis/crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis, histamine release, and by other methods. In spite of the use of different versions of methods and different reagents, quite consistent results were obtained, and the proposed IS was found to have a satisfactory activity in all assays and to be useful as a calibrator when allergenic potency of similar dog allergenic extracts was estimated. Four laboratories estimated the specific content of allergens Ag 3, Ag 13, and albumin and found the proposed IS to be a suitable standard for these assays. On the basis of the results from this study, the World Health Organization established the preparation as the international standard for dog hair/dander extract with an assigned unitage of 100,000 IU per ampule. The units refer to both the total allergenic activity of the ampule and to that of individual allergens.\r"

Exposure to mechanically produced tobacco smoke was performed in a static inhalation chamber for two-hour intervals at two distinct smoke levels (as measured by carbon monoxide, nicotine, and particulate levels). Seven of the 21 smoke-challenged subjects experienced a significant (greater than 20%) decline in FEV1 during passive exposure to tobacco smoke. One of these seven subjects was nonatopic, whereas a second subject had a negative response to methacholine challenge. The smoke-challenge responses were reproducible in all seven reactive subjects. Increasing concentrations of tobacco smoke failed to elicit pulmonary changes in previously challenged, unreactive or \"smoke-tolerant\" subjects. There was no association between a positive smoke challenge and the presence of serum IgE antibodies and/or a positive immediate wheal-and-flare skin test to a tobacco leaf extract. Collectively, these studies document a significant decline in pulmonary function in a substantial percentage (33%) of a population of \"smoke-sensitive\" subjects with asthma exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. The data also dissociate this effect from tobacco-leaf hypersensitivity.\r"

Specificity of the assay was characterized by reacting urine samples at two different incubation temperatures and with varying amounts of highly purified histamine N-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine. The radiolabeled products were then separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by fluorescence-enhanced autoradiography. Our results indicate that at least one other substrate for histamine N-methyltransferase in addition to histamine is present in human urine, although the identity of this compound could not be determined. Optimization of enzyme-reaction conditions eliminated the methylation of this unidentified substrate while the methylation of histamine was maintained. The average urinary unidentified substrate while the methylation of histamine was maintained. The average urinary excretion of histamine determined for male subjects (N = 37) and female subjects (N = 111) was 18.7 micrograms/24 hr and 27.3 micrograms/24 hr, respectively. More than 12% of the normal female subjects examined had urinary-histamine excretion rates in excess of 50 micrograms/24 hr, which overlaps into the range previously considered to be indicative of abnormal mast cell secretion. In summary, this is the first radioenzymatic assay for histamine with documented specificity for the measurement of histamine in human urine.\r"

A controversial issue in the field of drug allergy is whether ARs are more frequent or severe in atopic subjects. Thus, we performed a case-control study comparing the distribution of various clinical and biologic signs of atopy. The case group included 32 patients with a history of AR to suxamethonium, the most commonly used muscle relaxant. The control group included 128 subjects, matched to the case group according to age, gender, and socioeconomic status. The case group consisted mainly of young and middle-aged women. Distribution of symptoms suggestive of atopy and of skin tests and specific IgE to common aeroallergens was similar in both groups. In contrast, total serum IgE level was much higher in the case group, suggesting the presence of specific IgE against suxamethonium or other drugs. Thus, despite previous studies in the literature, atopy is not a risk factor for the occurrence of anaphylactic reactions to muscle relaxants. As AR to suxamethonium is a pure model of an IgE-dependent drug allergy, our data do not support a relationship between atopy and allergic drug reactions.\r"

On the basis of age and allergen-specific IgE responses, patients were randomly divided for treatment with either an extract prepared from whole mite culture (WMC) or from purified mite bodies (MB). The content of major allergens was quantified for both extracts. The allergen dose administered during immunotherapy was increased up to the highest tolerated dose. The mean cumulative dose of Der p I was 98.9 micrograms for the WMC-treatment group and 76.7 micrograms for the MB-treatment group. Small, but statistically significant, decreases in RAST and crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis responses to major allergens were recorded after 2 years of treatment. A small increase in specific IgG1 and a large persistent increase in specific IgG4 was recorded in both groups. There was a significant decrease in allergen-specific bronchial sensitivity, skin reactivity, and leukocyte sensitivity in both treatment groups. Between both groups, changes in the different parameters were not significantly different. Our data indicate that immunotherapy with both partially purified house dust mite extracts, WMC, and MB leads to a decrease in allergen-specific IgE responses and induce a response in specific IgG4. Both extracts are comparable in modulating leukocyte and skin sensitivity, as well as bronchial reactivity to mite allergens.\r"

Eighty-four Fellows and Members of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology participated in the study. All subjects had a history of an adverse reaction to one or more Hymenoptera insects. The mean age was 30 1/2 years (range 1 to 83 years). Male subjects accounted for 61.5% and female subjects, 38.5%; 3.1% were beekeepers and 32.3% were atopic. Demographic data were similar for subgroups. There was an average of 2.7 history stings per subject. At least one systemic reaction (SR) was reported by 2866 subjects (89%); 2219 (69%) experienced an SR after their most recent sting before entry into the study, and 70% had experienced only a single SR. Moderate to severe SRs were equally likely after stings of yellow jacket, white-faced hornet, and yellow hornet (65%), honeybee (67%), or wasp (70%), although historical SRs were reported more often after stings of yellow jacket, white-faced hornet, or yellow hornet (30%) than after honeybee (19%) or wasp (14%) stings. No association was noted between the number of stings per episode and severity of the SR. Fifty-one percent of SRs were reported as occurring within 10 minutes of sting; however, the onset of a moderate to severe SR sometimes occurred at 301 or more minutes after a sting episode. Of 2219 subjects with an SR after their most recent sting before entry into the study, 68% received epinephrine for treatment.\r"

One previous observation demonstrating spontaneous and 48/80-induced release of histamine greater in patients with CU than in NC subjects was confirmed with a concentration of 48/80 believed to produce mast cell activation in most subjects (2.4 mg/ml). In fact, higher concentrations of histamine were released by patients with CU than by NC subjects on stimulation with 48/80 at concentration greater than 0.6 mg/ml. With 0.6 mg/ml of 48/80, the profiles of histamine release were comparable in the two groups, and for concentration less than 0.6 mg/ml, the profiles of release were completely different, being higher in NC subjects than in the group with CU. The peak histamine response was higher in the group of NC subjects (6500 pg/ml) than in the group with CU (5100 pg/ml), and the concentration of 48/80 needed to trigger maximum release was lower in the NC subjects than in the subjects with CU (0.15 versus 0.6 mg/ml). The production of leukotriene B4 and leukotriene C4 was also compared in these two groups after stimulation with 2.4 mg/ml of compound 48/80. No significant amount of leukotriene B4 was found in the collection chambers, but small amounts of leukotriene C4 were measured into skin chamber fluids during a period of 4 hours. No significant difference could then be observed between the two groups.\r"

The disease is defined biochemically by a deficiency in the functional activity of C1 esterase inhibitor. To date, the actual serum or tissue mediator(s) responsible for the angioedematous lesion remains controversial. Although antihistaminics have been clearly demonstrated to have no efficacy in the long-term treatment of this disorder, instances of elevated urine-histamine levels in patients with HAE raises the possibility of a role for histamine in the pathophysiology of this disease. Urine samples were collected from 28 asymptomatic and from 11 symptomatic patients with HAE. The urine-histamine levels were compared with levels of 41 normal control subjects. With the exception of one asymptomatic patient with HAE whose diagnoses also included rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjogren's syndrome, the urine-histamine levels from asymptomatic patients with HAE were similar to values obtained from normal control subjects. Except for data from two patients with HAE, urine-histamine levels from symptomatic patients with HAE were also indistinguishable from levels of normal volunteers. These data suggest that the vast majority of patients with HAE have normal urine-histamine levels both during and between attacks. Consequently, histamine is unlikely to play a pathophysiologic role in HAE.\r"

In this assay, microplate wells were coated with the allergen proteins that had been dispersed in the presence of 0.5 mol/L NaCl and 20 micrograms/ml of bovine serum albumin, followed by addition of test serum, and then the biotinylated allergen. Beta-galactosidase-conjugated streptavidin was used for detection of the captured allergen, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside was used as the enzyme substrate, and fluorescence intensity of the product, 4-methylumbelliferone, was measured by a fluorometric reader. This assay was found to detect a total activity of IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies present in the serum of the patients with pollinosis. IgG (+IgA) antibody was determined after absorption of the serum with anti-IgE Sepharose gel. Sera from individuals who were unexposed to the pollens demonstrated no nonspecific reactions in this assay. This method may be useful as a simple technique for monitoring the efficacy of immunotherapy that is expected to elicit IgG blocking antibody and also for large-scale seroepidemiologic studies on the prevalence of non-IgE antibodies in a general population.\r"

Increase LTC4 concentrations in NPS were noted in all the children during the pollen season; the concentration of LTC4 increased from a preseasoned mean of 1.87 +/- 0.43 ng/ml to 5.52 +/- 0.7 ng/ml at the peak of the ragweed season (p less than 0.001). The mean LTC4 concentration 2 weeks after the end of the ragweed season declined only to about 4.45 +/- 1.04 ng/ml. The seasonal variation of LTC4 concentrations and symptom scores of the children paralleled the pattern of the ragweed-pollen count. All children studied were ragweed sensitive, and six children were additionally sensitive to Alternaria (mold). The mold-sensitive children demonstrated higher concentrations of LTC4 in their NPS before and continued to have high LTC4 levels after the peak ragweed season, coinciding with peaks of mold-spore counts. Data presented in this study suggest that mast cells and other target cells in the nasal mucosa of children with allergic rhinitis produce pharmacologically active mediators, such as LTC4, during natural exposure to ragweed or Alternaria.\r"

Serum was tested for total IgE level and for specific IgE antibodies by RAST with WBE and venom (V) of S. invicta. In vitro results were compared with those of 19 age and sex-matched atopic control subjects. The range of total serum IgE level was 31 to 1720 IU/ml (geometric mean 160 IU/ml), compared with 7.5 to 6756 IU/ml (geometric mean 85 IU/ml) in the control subjects. The difference between the two groups, however, was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). In the IFA-allergic group, the IFA WBE RAST mean binding was 13.5% (range 2.0% to 30.2%), and the IFA V RAST mean was 29.2% (range 7.8% to 46.7%). The control sera demonstrated low levels of activity to both IFA WBE RAST (0.7% to 4.8%) and IFA V RAST (0.7% to 5.9%). IFA WBE RAST demonstrated that 26% of the IFA-allergic patients had counts within the range of the atopic control subjects. In contrast, the IFA V RAST clearly separated all IFA-allergic patients from their age and sex-matched atopic control subjects. A scoring system for IFA V RAST is proposed. These results demonstrate superiority of IFA V over IFA WBE RAST in the diagnosis of allergy to S. invicta.\r"

To examine this hypothesis, we determined the number and distribution of MCs in the skin of nine normal subjects, nine patients with UEA/UEF, six patients with urticaria pigmentosa (UP), and 14 patients with SM. Skin biopsy specimens of normal subjects contained 38.4 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) MCs per square millimeter. Biopsy specimens of patients with UEA/UEF contained 71.8 +/- 13 MCs per square millimeter. Although the numbers were significantly different from numbers in skin of normal subjects (p less than 0.05), similar modest increases in MC numbers are observed in a number of skin conditions. In marked contrast, lesional biopsy specimens of patients with UP contained 596.5 +/- 278 MCs per square millimeter (p less than 0.05, n = 6, compared to MC numbers in the skin of normal subjects), and patients with SM had 720.6 +/- 176 MCs per square millimeter in lesional skin (p less than 0.01, n = 12, compared to normal skin). Patients with UP or SM also had increased MC numbers in nonlesional skin compared to normal skin (168.0 MCs per square millimeter, p less than 0.05, n = 5, and 184.4 MCs per square millimeter, p less than 0.01, n = 10, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The inhibition of LTC4R was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than the inhibition of HR only at intermediate (10(-5) to 3 X 10(-5) mol/L) doses of the drugs. Two other inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (bromophenacyl bromide and phenidone) affected the release of both mediators equally. Two drugs that activate adenylate cyclase (prostaglandin E1 and dimaprit) inhibited release in a dose-dependent fashion but failed to preferentially affect either HR or LTC4R. Isoproterenol (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L), a third activator of adenylate cyclase, caused only moderate (30%) inhibition of HR, even when the reaction was staged, but was slightly (0.1 less than p less than 0.05) more potent against leukotriene release. The final drug tested was the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine, which proved to be an effective (50% to 100%) inhibitor of both mediators in the range 10(-5) to 10(-3) mol/L.\r"

Symptom-medication scores were significantly (p less than 0.005, Mann-Whitney U test) reduced in the treated group by comparison to the placebo-treated patients.

Serum grass-pollen IgG titrated by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay with Staphylococcus A protein was significantly (p less than 0.01, Wilcoxon W test) increased after treatment with allergoid, but there was no significant correlation between IgG titer and symptom scores during the season. Serum grass-pollen IgE increased (p less than 0.04, Wilcoxon W test) in the treated group but there was no correlation with symptom scores.\r"

Patients maintained daily symptom and adverse-experience diaries and were evaluated every 2 weeks by the investigators. Pseudoephedrine, 30 mg, was provided as backup medication. Amelioration of most individual symptoms and a decrease in the total symptom scores were observed with both dosages of azelastine; greater improvement with 2 mg twice daily than with 1 mg twice daily, was observed. Nasal congestion, as a symptom and as reflected by rhinomanometric assessment, was the least improved parameter. Backup decongestant medication decreased during treatment with azelastine and increased during the placebo regimen. There were no major adverse effects.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to investigate the inflammatory changes occurring in the human conjunctiva at different time periods after allergen provocation. Twenty-three ryegrass-sensitive patients with allergic conjunctivitis (19 with hayfever and four with vernal conjunctivitis) were challenged by topical administration of ryegrass antigen to the eye. Allergen concentrations were increased in increments until an immediate ocular allergic reaction was elicited. Numbers of various inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) found in conjunctival scrapings were quantified and correlated with the clinical profile, total serum IgE, and serum IgE to Rye I antigen. Twenty minutes after some level of antigen topical challenge to the eye, all patients had ocular redness, tearing, and itching. Compared with findings in seven control subjects, significant inflammatory cells were found in the conjunctival scrapings of patients before challenge (p less than 0.05) and 20 minutes (p less than 0.001) and 6 hours (p less than 0.002) after effective challenge. Significant increases in neutrophils of patients occurred after 20 minutes (p less than 0.001), and in eosinophils at 6 hours (p less than 0.005), compared with values of control subjects. When each case was evaluated individually, nine of the 23 patients had highly evident inflammatory changes 6 hours after allergen provocation. The levels of total serum IgE and serum IgE to Rye I antigen of these nine patients did not differ significantly from the other patients in the study. Our data provide the first evidence in humans that significant inflammatory changes in conjunctival scrapings are present long after allergen exposure has ended.\r"

Twenty patients started IT with birch extract (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) before the season. The other 20 patients were not treated with IT. Histamine-challenge tests were performed before, at the start, at pollen peak, at the end, and after the birch-pollen season. Blood samples for determination of ECP were collected at the same time. Skin prick tests and nasal provocation tests were also performed before and after the season. A significant increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness was noted in the group treated with IT and in the untreated group during the season. The increase was greatest in the untreated group with the maximal difference between the two groups at the end of the pollen season (p less than 0.07). IT treatment was followed by significantly less medication and higher peak expiratory flow values. The levels of ECP increased during the season in untreated patients (p less than 0.05) but not in patients treated with IT. The ECP levels of patients from both groups correlated significantly with histamine sensitivity (p less than 0.001).\r"

Exposure to SO2 (0.1 to 16.6 ppm) was performed in a 20 L exposure chamber for 8 hours on 5 consecutive days, while temperature, moisture, and concentration of SO2 were monitored and kept constant. SO2 concentrations were measured hourly by Schiff's reaction. On the last 3 days, SO2 exposure was followed by inhalation of nebulized ovalbumin (OA) for 45 minutes. One week later, specific bronchial provocation with inhaled OA (0.1%) followed by plethysmographic measurements of airway obstruction were performed every 2 days during a 2-week period. Specific antibodies against OA were measured in serum and bronchoalveolar fluid by a direct enzyme immunoassay. The SO2-exposed group (N = 17) demonstrated 67% to 100% positive bronchial reactions to inhaled OA, depending on the concentration of SO2, whereas the control group without previous SO2 exposure (N = 14) demonstrated bronchial reactions in only one animal (7%: p less than 0.05). The degree of bronchial obstruction was significantly higher in the exposed group, compared to the control group, for all SO2 concentrations (p less than 0.05). OA-specific antibodies in serum and bronchoalveolar fluid increased in SO2-exposed groups significantly, compared to the control group (p less than 0.05). It is concluded from these results that exposure to SO2 in low and medium concentrations can facilitate local allergic sensitization in the guinea pig.\r"

  ".W": "The human eosinophil contains lysosomal enzymes that can contribute directly to tissue injury and inflammation. Characterization of lysosomal-enzyme release from the eosinophil has been largely limited to isolates from patients with hypereosinophilia. Because eosinophils from such individuals may not demonstrate normal functional responses, we established a method to obtain purified, normal human eosinophils with a Percoll gradient. With this method, it is possible to isolate eosinophils (95.5 +/- 3.9%) and neutrophils (greater than 99%) in high purity from normal subjects. With these granulocyte isolates, we evaluated and compared release of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase (BG), after cell activation with opsonized zymosan particles. Neutrophils released 33.0 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- SEM; n = 5) of total BG (30 minutes of incubation with zymosan), whereas eosinophil secretion was 24.2 +/- 1.7% (n = 5). The fungal metabolite, cytochalasin B (CB), which inhibits microfilament activity, enhanced BG secretion from neutrophils (33.0 +/- 1.2% to 42.8 +/- 2.8% with CB; p less than 0.01). In contrast, CB had no effect on eosinophil BG release. Interestingly, BG content in eosinophils is 101.2 +/- 3.9 micrograms phenolphthalein per 10(6) cells per 18 hours, which compares to a neutrophil level of 51.0 +/- 3.2 (p less than 0.001). Thus, although eosinophils and neutrophils release a similar percentage of total cellular BG on stimulation with zymosan particles, the absolute amount of enzyme per cell is greater in the eosinophil than in the neutrophil. Study of eosinophil function promises to elicit a more complete insight into its contribution to tissue injury.\r"

A serum pool from rabbits immunized with the WBE elicited 31 precipitates on crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis was performed with sera from 26 RAST IFA-positive subjects, 24 of whom were known for clinical hypersensitivity to IFA and two subjects, known to be hypersensitive to yellow jacket. Radiostaining was obtained to 14 precipitates, some of which were judged to be partially identical. Thus, six apparently different allergen groups could be identified. Two of these fulfilled arbitrary criteria of major allergens. Three of the IFA WBE allergens were easily identified in crossed immunoelectrophoresis of a commercially obtained IFA-venom preparation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the IFA WBE demonstrated protein bands with molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 200,000 daltons. An immunoblotting technique with nitrocellulose paper strips revealed binding of human IgE from hypersensitive subjects to four different bands (either single bands or clusters of proteins of similar molecular weight) with molecular weights ranging from 13,000 to 42,000 daltons. It is a notable finding that these insect allergens thus were of a similar size as important aeroallergens.\r"

  ".W": "Levocabastine is a new, highly potent, and specific H1 antagonist. The effects of this drug, administered topically, were evaluated in a conjunctival provocation test (CPT) with allergens. CPT was performed by the instillation of one drop of allergen at increasing concentrations in the inferior conjunctival sac of each eye, alternatively, and stopped when both itching and redness of the conjunctiva were present. The concentration of allergen at this step was considered as the reaction threshold. Eleven patients, allergic to grass pollen, underwent, in winter, a first CPT without pretreatment (screening test); the CPT was then repeated twice after a 24-hour treatment, once, with a placebo, and once, with levocabastine (one drop twice a day, 0.5 mg/ml), administered in a double-blind fashion and in random order. The minimal interval between the two tests was 1 week. There was no significant difference between the thresholds determined in the two CPTs performed without medication (screening test and placebo), whereas the threshold was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) after pretreatment with levocabastine. Individually, the threshold increased in 10/11 patients (p less than 0.01). Levocabastine prevented both redness and itching. A late allergic reaction was observed by the patient in 6/11 CPTs performed after placebo treatment and 8/11 after levocabastine treatment. We conclude that, in this model of allergic conjunctivitis, levocabastine increased the conjunctival tolerance to an allergen. Further studies should help to determine the true place of this H1 antagonist in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.\r"

The airway response to increasing concentrations of histamine aerosol was assessed by measuring FEV1. The threshold provocative dose of histamine needed to cause a 20% fall in starting FEV1 (PD20) was measured by log dose-response curve. Histamine challenge was performed in duplicate after premedication with placebo or 40 mg of propranolol on separate days. The mean starting FEV1 did not change significantly after placebo and after propranolol administration. The mean PD20 values after propranolol (0.37 mg/ml and 0.32 mg/ml, respectively, for the first and the second challenge) were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than mean control PD20 values (1.36 mg/ml and 1.48 mg/ml, respectively, for the first and the second challenge). These results indicate that propranolol increases airway responsiveness to histamine, even in those subjects with asthma in whom propranolol has little bronchoconstrictive effect.\r"
