These figures may double by the year 2000 primarily because of our aging population, with age being the leading risk factor for cancer. It is believed that the majority of cancer can either be prevented or treated successfully if it is diagnosed early. Primary care physicians and other health professionals delivering information on prevention and performing early diagnostic studies in various ambulatory settings represent the key to the reduced morbidity and mortality of cancer by virtue of their position in the health care delivery system within communities. Barriers and incentives for delivering these all important health measures are examined and suggestions are made for their accomplishment. It is recommended that the primary thrust should be toward the development of methodology which will allow the primary care physician to institute these measures in his regular medical practice and to coordinate them with other health maintenance and early diagnostic activities in the ambulatory setting.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial depolarization was analyzed in 14 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome undergoing surgery to ablate accessory atrioventricular pathways associated with tachyarrhythmias. Bipolar potentials were recorded simultaneously from 156 atrial epicardial electrodes arranged in three templates to fit the anterior and posterior aspects of both atria. Spontaneous or sinus rhythms were recorded, as were atrial escape rhythms after overdrive pacing at rates of 150 and 200 beats/min. Atrial activation maps revealed different patterns of impulse initiation varying from typical unifocal sinus node impulse origin, unifocal extranodal impulse origin, and multicentric impulse origin from two to four widely distributed atrial pacemaker sites. In subjects demonstrating only unifocal impulse origin during control or sinus rhythm, other widely divergent pacemaker sites were recorded in other maps during subsequent rhythms. In addition to sites located at the upper superior vena cava-right atrium junction, pacemakers also dominated at sites anterior and inferior to the sinus node region during both control and escape depolarizations. Most of the subjects were found to have two or more pacemaker sites when maps of all control and postpacing conditions were analyzed. The right atrial pacemaker region encompassed a zone of 7.5 X 1.5 cm centered about the long axis of the sulcus terminalis posteriorly and the precaval band anteriorly. An unexpected finding was the participation of left atrial escape pacemakers. The functional behavior of both the control and escape pacemakers, as assessed by sinus node recovery time, was normal, indicating physiologic operation of the extranodal sites as part of an overall system of distributed pacemakers involved in the control of rate. Although functional assessment was limited in these initial patient studies, correspondence with similar observations in extensive previous canine studies supports the concept of a widely distributed atrial pacemaker complex in man.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study the possibility that tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries may result of embryonic arrests in the normal rotation of the junction of the outflow tract and the great arteries was investigated. The results suggested that the development of other transposition complexes such as double-outlet right ventricle might also be related to arrests in this process of rotation. To further study this question 20 normal hearts and 15 hearts with double-outlet right ventricle obtained at autopsy were studied. The angle of the aortic-to-pulmonary valve axis relative to the inferior surface of the heart, as viewed from apex to base, was measured from postmortem radiographs. For normal hearts the mean angle was 81 +/- 7(SE) degrees. For 13 of the 15 hearts with double-outlet right ventricle the mean angle was 4 +/- 7(SE) degrees. Two hearts with double-outlet right ventricle showed markedly divergent aortic-to-pulmonary valve angles, with a mean of 228 +/- 11(SE) degrees, and were therefore grouped separately. Although direct comparison of hearts and embryos is difficult because of the differences in methods of determining angles, the valve positions in normal hearts was most similar to Carnegie stage 19, as found in an earlier study. The majority of the hearts with double-outlet right ventricle resembled stage 16 embryos. The results of this study, as well as those of the earlier studies, support the hypothesis that a spectrum of cardiac anomalies with anomalous origin of great vessels arises as arrests in the normal rotation of the semilunar valve region during embryogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanical dysfunction is the strongest predictor of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia. Contraction-excitation feedback whereby changes in myocardial length/tension influence the time course of repolarization and excitability would provide a possible mechanism. Such a relationship has been shown in animals but has yet to be demonstrated in man. A useful model for studying this relationship is provided by the process of weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass after routine coronary artery surgery. During this weaning period of approximately 1 min, the heart is converted from being partially empty and flaccid (i.e., a \"nonworking\" state) to being filled and stretched to support the circulation (i.e., a \"working\" state). Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) were recorded from the left ventricular epicardium as a measure of repolarization time in 16 patients at discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Systolic pressure was recorded from the radial artery line. Measurements were made at three stages that related to different dynamic states of the heart: (1) starting to come off bypass (\"minimally working\"), defined as the time of first appearance of an inflection on the arterial pressure trace indicating the start of left ventricular ejection and valve opening, when arterial pressures represent left ventricular pressure, (2) half off bypass (\"partially working\"), and (3) off bypass (\"wholly working\"). During the process of discontinuing bypass MAP duration shortened, while systolic pressure increased. MAP duration at 90% and 60% repolarization (MAP D90, MAP D60) decreased from 288.0 +/- 29.5 msec (mean +/- SEM) and 235.0 +/- 27.9 msec in the minimally working heart to 274.5 +/- 30.2 msec and 224.2 +/- 27.3 msec in the partially working heart (p less than .001), with a subsequent decrease to 261.0 +/- 28.8 and 214.0 +/- 28.7 when the heart was wholly working (p less than .001). Systolic pressure increased from 54.1 +/- 9.3 mm Hg in the minimally working heart to 65.9 +/- 13.8 mm Hg in the partially working heart (p less than .001) and subsequently increased to 75.5 +/- 13.3 mm Hg when the heart was wholly working (p less than .001). Mean heart rates did not change significantly. A strong correlation was obtained between absolute MAP duration and systolic pressure. Regression analysis revealed: MAP D90 vs systolic pressure (p less than .001) and MAP D60 vs systolic pressure (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The existence and cause of this phenomenon in the right ventricle has not been studied in animals or in man. Accordingly, we altered right ventricular pressure with intravenous phenylephrine (0.2 to 0.3 mg) and nitroprusside (0.5 to 1.5 micrograms/kg/min) to achieve three disparate peak right ventricular pressures in nine normal subjects after partial autonomic blockade with atropine (1 mg) and propranolol (0.15 mg/kg). Simultaneous high-fidelity right ventricular pressures and biplane cineventriculographic volumes were acquired during the three resultant loading conditions. Right atrial pacing maintained heart rate constant at each pressure level. Peak right ventricular systolic pressure (23 +/- 3 vs 31 +/- 9 vs 45 +/- 6 mm Hg, all p less than .01) and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (4 +/- 2 vs 8 +/- 4 vs 11 +/- 3 mm Hg, all p less than .01) were significantly different at low, medium, and high loading conditions, respectively. Right ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relations were, in parallel, shifted upward with altered loading in each patient. This was manifest by an unchanged dynamic chamber stiffness constant and a significant increase in the diastolic pressure volume y intercept at each load (1.98 +/- 2.21 vs 5.33 +/- 5.39 vs 8.51 +/- 3.99 mm Hg, p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This view, however, is rapidly disappearing. Therefore, using QRS changes in body surface potential maps in the chronic phase, we have attempted to differentiate patients with or without right ventricular involvement. Thirty patients with chronic inferior myocardial infarction (2 or more months after onset) were studied, in whom 87 unipolar ECGs and right ventriculograms were recorded. The patients were then divided into three groups depending on the locations of their abnormal QRS potentials (-2SD area) exceeding the normal range (mean -2SD). In group A, the -2SD area was located predominantly on the right inferior chest, in group B on the left inferior chest, and in group N on both the right and left inferior chests equally. The results showed that group A had a lower right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) compared with group B (A, 40 +/- 7%; B, 53 +/- 10%; p less than .001), while there was no difference in left ventricular ejection fraction between the two groups (49 +/- 11% and 49 +/- 11%, respectively). Moreover, right ventricular asynergy occurred in 14 of the 18 patients (78%) of group A but in only one of the 10 patients (10%) of group B. Group N was presumed to be intermediate between groups A and B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, sudden death correlates best with a shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation (SRRPE) of 260 msec or less. We infused 10 to 12 mg/kg procainamide to 56 patients to determine whether persistence or loss of preexcitation in sinus rhythm identified patients with SRRPEs of 260 or less or greater than 260 msec, respectively. Atrial fibrillation was induced in 53 patients. Of these, 32 patients had persistence of preexcitation with procainamide infusion and SRRPE in this group of patients was shorter than that in patients in whom preexcitation was lost (194 +/- 44 vs 235 +/- 55 msec, p less than .05). However, preexcitation persisted after procainamide infusion in only 31 of 46 (67%) patients with SRRPEs of 260 msec or less. Furthermore, 15 of 21 patients who lost preexcitation had SRRPEs of 260 msec or less and two of these patients had a history of ventricular fibrillation. The correlation between AERPAP and SRRPE was studied in a separate group of 79 patients with single accessory pathways. There was a significant (p less than .001) but poor (r = .58) correlation between these two variables. Thus, the procainamide test regarding accessory pathway refractoriness often cannot be extrapolated to SRRPE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

K1 is a low-amplitude, low-frequency signal that is present with cuff pressures above systolic pressure. K2 is a triphasic signal appearing at systolic pressure and disappearing at diastolic pressure, which approximately corresponds to the audible Korotkoff sound. K3 appears with cuff pressure between systolic and diastolic pressure and continues to be present below diastolic pressure. Intra-arterial pressure recordings made with a high-fidelity Millar catheter-tip manometer revealed K2 and K3 analogs. K3 resembles the intra-arterial pressure waveform and when calibrated according to the pulse pressure, noninvasive dK3/dt determinations correlated well with intra-arterial dP/dt measurements. The appearance/disappearance property of K2 was designated as the \"K2 algorithm\" and represents a new, objective noninvasive method for measurement of blood pressure. The K2 algorithm compares favorably with intra-arterial measurements, is more accurate than the auscultatory technique, and may be especially useful in clinical situations in which the auscultatory technique does not work well.\r"

  ".W": "It has been previously reported that at treadmill exercise testing an abnormal ratio of recovery systolic blood pressure (SBP) to peak exercise SBP is more sensitive than exercise-induced angina or ST segment depression for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). To investigate whether the SBP ratio keeps its diagnostic value during upright bicycle exercise, we evaluated the ratio of postexercise SBP to peak SBP in 73 patients with angiographically documented CAD and in 48 patients with normal coronary arteries (OV group) undergoing maximal stress testing on a bicycle ergometer. Three minutes after exercise ended, SBP ratio was significantly higher in the CAD than in the OV group (0.79 +/- 0.1 vs 0.71 +/- 0.08; p less than .001). Setting the upper normal limits of the recovery SBP ratio at 2 SDs from the mean for the OV group (SBP ratio = 0.98 and 0.88 at 1 and 3 min after exercise, respectively), with an increase or no change in SBP ratio at between 1 and 3 min of recovery considered an abnormal response, the sensitivity of SBP ratio was 30%, the specificity was 83%, and the accuracy was 51%. The respective values for ST depression were 81% (p less than .0001 vs SBP ratio), 48% (p less than .001 vs SBP ratio), and 67% (p less than .01 vs SBP ratio). Thus, for bicycle ergometer exercise testing, ST segment depression seems to be more accurate than SBP ratio in diagnosing CAD.\r"

Analyses of the data document a relatively low level of knowledge of correct indications and regimens for antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis. Respondents were unsure, and often incorrect, about the relationship between a variety of cardiac conditions and potential risk for endocarditis. Compliance with the guidelines for proper dosage and timing of antibiotics was also problematic. Those clinicians who had a better understanding of patient risk factors and the principles underlying the AHA recommendations were more likely to follow them, as were practitioners who kept a copy of the recommendations in the office. The findings are significant in view of previous suggestions that use of inappropriate antibiotic regimens may predispose to adverse outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "Although the short-term results of atrial level repair of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) are satisfactory, longer follow-up has disclosed a significant incidence of systemic right ventricular dysfunction and rhythm disturbances. The arterial switch operation (ASO) may represent a major improvement by restoring the left ventricle as the systemic ventricle and avoiding extensive atrial surgery. We have prospectively evaluated 49 consecutive survivors of ASO for TGA with intact ventricular septum (IVS) by clinical examination, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and invasive electrophysiologic studies. The mean length of follow-up has been 29 +/- 14 (SD) months after surgery. All children are currently asymptomatic and on no medications. Severe supravalvular pulmonary stenosis (greater than 60 mm Hg) was present in five children, all of whom have undergone reoperation. No patient has severe supravalvular aortic obstruction. Mild degrees of supravalvular pulmonary or aortic obstruction have not progressed. Seven children (14%) have trivial or mild aortic regurgitation. Two children have proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with adequate retrograde collateral perfusion. One child had an electrocardiographic pattern of inferior myocardial infarction without evidence of ventricular dysfunction. Systemic (left) ventricular function is normal as measured by end-diastolic pressure (mean 7 +/- 6 mm Hg), ejection fraction (mean 68 +/- 6%), end-diastolic volume (mean 101 +/- 22% of predicted normal), and cardiac index (mean 4.7 +/- 1.3 liters/min/m2). Only one patient has sinus node dysfunction. There have been no late deaths. These early results are encouraging. We conclude that the arterial switch operation is currently the procedure of choice for neonates with TGA and IVS.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to define the histologic features of the cryolesions in relationship to the specialized conduction system. In 12 adult dogs a series of nine discrete cryolesions was placed along the perimeter of the triangle of Koch while continuously monitoring the His bundle electrogram. All animals survived the operation and maintained intact atrioventricular conduction. At 14 weeks after surgery the hearts were sectioned and examined. In all 12 animals there was a confluent mass of dense fibrous tissue present in the lower atrial septum that was in immediate proximity to but did not involve the atrioventricular node-His bundle. The ablation of perinodal tissue with preservation of the specialized conduction system with the use of this cryosurgical technique was confirmed. It is likely that the cryoablated perinodal tissue represents the proximal common pathway of the circuit for atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia.\r"

It would be useful to have more specific means of automatically identifying pathologic tachycardias. Using unfiltered (0.04 to 500 Hz bandpass) recordings made during electrophysiologic testing in 10 patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), we studied the differences in electrogram morphology during sinus rhythm and VT. Signals were digitized at 1 kHz. A template of a normal sinus rhythm electrogram was created for each patient by averaging five sinus complexes from the beginning of each study. Ten sinus electrograms just before the onset of VT and 10 electrograms during stable monomorphic VT were compared with this template. The difference in morphology between a given electrogram and its template was quantitated by superimposing the two signals and measuring the area between the curves. There was no overlap in the ranges of these \"area of the difference\" measurements between sinus and VT electrograms from any of the 10 patients studied, including four with intraventricular conduction disturbances. In contrast, discrete features of the signal, including peak amplitude and maximum dV/dt, did not reliably differentiate sinus from VT electrograms. Bandpass filtering, sample window size, and digitizing rate were manipulated to determine the minimal signal content necessary for the area of difference method to reliably identify VT. These interventions suggest that the low-frequency far-field portion of the signal is primarily responsible for the morphologic differences between sinus and VT electrograms. In conclusion, the morphology of VT electrograms in man is consistently and distinctly different from the morphology of sinus electrograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Global ischemia produced a progressive decrease of resting membrane potential, depression of action potentials, and conduction slowing to approximately 50% of control values over 8 to 10 min. Verapamil (2 X 10(-6) M) markedly attenuated ischemia-induced conduction slowing in association with less depression of maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and slightly less change in resting membrane potential. In contrast, Bay K 8644 (10(-7) M), a calcium-channel agonist, exacerbated ischemia-induced conduction slowing and depression of Vmax but did not significantly affect resting membrane potential. Regression analysis of Vmax vs resting membrane potential and the square of conduction velocity vs Vmax demonstrated that verapamil and Bay K 8644 shifted these relationships in opposite directions. The results indicate that the calcium-channel activation state can modulate slowing of conduction during early ischemia. This is most likely due to alterations in calcium influx before and/or during ischemia. There appear to be three possible components to this effect: (1) a small alteration in the magnitude of ischemia-induced depolarization, (2) alterations of membrane responsiveness at depolarized values of resting membrane potential, and (3) alterations in \"nonactive\" components of conduction during ischemia, such as changes in excitability or cell-to-cell coupling.\r"

Since early afterdepolarizations have been proposed as a cause of the long QT syndrome and the related ventricular tachyarrhythmias, we hypothesized that magnesium therapy would suppress both the early afterdepolarizations and the ventricular arrhythmias. The present study was performed to test that hypothesis. Using monophasic action potentials (MAP) recorded with a contact electrode from the right ventricular endocardium to demonstrate early afterdepolarizations, cesium chloride (168 mg/kg iv) was administered before, during, and 1 to 2 hr after discontinuation of a magnesium infusion (1 to 2 mg/kg/min for 20 to 30 min). Before magnesium infusion, cesium induced early afterdepolarizations that were 49.7 +/- 1.6% (mean +/- SE) of the amplitude of the corresponding monophasic action potential. The amplitude of the early afterdepolarization decreased to 31.2 +/- 3.8% of the MAP amplitude during magnesium infusion (p less than .003) and increased to 48.0 +/- 4.0% 1 to 2 hr after termination of the magnesium infusion (p less than .003). Cesium induced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, or ventricular fibrillation in 12 of 13 dogs before magnesium infusion, and in eight of 11 dogs 1 to 2 hr after stopping infusion, but in only three of 13 dogs during magnesium infusion. Cesium prolonged the corrected QT interval from 338 +/- 16 msec (control) to 387 +/- 14 msec before (p less than .003), 356 +/- 12 msec during (p less than .003), and 406 +/- 16 msec after stopping the magnesium infusion (p less than .003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) would be useful in ameliorating myocardial ischemia under conditions characterized by preserved, but reduced (relative to demand), myocardial blood flow. Studies were conducted in closed-chest, sedated domestic swine prepared with an artificial stenosis that reduced luminal diameter of the animal's left anterior descending coronary artery by 80%. Measurements of hemodynamics, regional myocardial blood flow, and oxygen, lactate, and nucleoside metabolism were obtained in 10 animals (1) before placement of stenosis, (2) 30 min after insertion of stenosis, (3) after 30 and 60 min of PICSO, and (4) 30 min after discontinuation of PICSO. Two groups of control animals were studied to observe the natural history of metabolic markers of ischemia. Control group I consisted of four animals studied concurrently and subjected to the same protocol except for the fact that PICSO was not applied. Control group II consisted of eight additional animals studied as a group. A specially designed balloon-tipped catheter positioned in the proximal portion of the animal's great cardiac vein was used to provide PICSO. Heart rate was controlled by atrial pacing (rate, 145 beats/min) through the study. After placement of the stenosis, flow in endocardial and transmural layers distal to the stenosis declined significantly (p less than .01) vs control. Application of PICSO failed to increase arterial inflow distal to the stenosis in any myocardial layer. Myocardial aerobic metabolism was adversely affected by stenosis and changed from consumption of lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine before stenosis to production at 30 min after stenosis. Although PICSO was associated with reduced production and a return toward consumption of lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine, a similar pattern of changes in lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine metabolism was observed in control animals over a comparable period of time. In addition, regional myocardial oxygen extraction and consumption were not changed vs poststenosis levels by PICSO. However, in comparison with controls, PICSO did accelerate the rate of resolution of myocardial ischemia as assessed by lactate metabolism. At 30 min of PICSO (or sham) the change vs poststenosis was +33.6 +/- 25.0 mumol/min/100 g in the PICSO but only +6.7 +/- 29.7 in the control group (p = .05). We conclude, therefore, that even though PICSO did not alter the final level of myocardial ischemia under conditions modeled in this study it did accelerate its rate of resolution, an effect that may be beneficial clinically.\r"

Recordings were taken during supraventricular drive or right atrial plus right ventricular pacing in control periods and at intervals for up to 10 hr after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Right ventricular pacing was used to simulate left bundle branch block. Myocardial infarction was documented with triphenyl tetrazolium staining. The PQRST areas during supraventricular drive and right atrial plus right ventricular pacing were highly correlated to each other both before and after coronary occlusion. The PQRST isoarea maps after coronary occlusion showed a strong pole overlying the ischemic area on the cardiac surface in open-chest animals and over the left anterior thorax in closed-chest animals. The PQRST pole was positive during the first 1 to 2 hr of occlusion and became negative after several hours. The findings demonstrate that localized abnormalities due to ischemia and infarction are manifest in body and cardiac surface PQRST isoarea maps of both supraventricular complexes and right ventricular paced complexes. The findings suggest that PQRST isoarea maps may aid in identification and localization of ischemic or infarcted myocardium in the setting of abnormal activation such as left bundle branch block.\r"

Left ventricular relaxation was measured during the occlusion and then both relaxation and chamber stiffness were measured at 3 hr, 24 hr, and 3, 5, and more than 22 days after infarction. Left ventricular pressures and left ventricular dP/dt were recorded with micromanometer-tipped catheters. Left ventricular relaxation was measured by computer digitization of the left ventricular pressure tracings and averaged over 100 to 150 cardiac cycles. Five chamber stiffness constants were calculated from pressure-volume curves that were obtained ex vivo. We found ventricular relaxation prolonged for the first hour after coronary occlusion; relaxation was maximally prolonged at 10 to 15 min after onset of occlusion. After 1 hr relaxation returned to normal. However, by 5 days ventricular relaxation was again prolonged. Left ventricular stiffness constants were increased at 3 and 24 hr, resulting in a shift of the left ventricular pressure-volume relation to the left. At 3 days after coronary artery ligation, all stiffness constants and the pressure-volume relation returned to normal. At more than 22 days the pressure-volume relation was shifted to the right and the stiffness constant for low filling pressures was decreased. V/VW was significantly decreased from 0.603 +/- 0.021 at 3 and 24 hr to 0.379 +/- 0.024 and 0.362 +/- 0.032, respectively.

The objective measure of hoarseness (spread or standard deviation of Fx histogram) correlated well with the patients' subjective assessment of hoarseness. Six patients showed a bi- or trimodal histogram following intubation. This is known to represent asymmetric muscular activity. It is concluded that change in voice following intubation correlates well with the measures of vocal fold trauma. These measures can be recorded as the change in spread, standard deviation of the Fx histogram. The transient postoperative hoarseness following intubation is due to laryngeal damage. This damage has 2 mechanisms; in most cases it is due to direct mucosal trauma but in other cases a deeper muscular damage occurs.\r"

Based on the results of this series the inferior-turbinate flap did not prove satisfactory for the closure of septal perforations.\r"

At the ten-year follow-up examination, interest was focused on the 228 hips graded as successful after five years. Sixty-six were excluded, one that had not been included at the five-year evaluation was traced, and 92% (150/163) were again clinically successful. The failure rate owing to mechanical causes during the first five years and between the five-year and ten-year follow-up examinations was 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively. The clinical results were considered highly satisfactory because only 50% of the hips judged successful at the ten-year examination had roentgenographically intact components.

They were compressively loaded in an Instron machine (Instron, Canton, Massachusetts) at 25-kg increments with 20 cycles applied at each load level. Subsidence was significantly decreased, and load to failure increased by the collar. None of the parameters was significantly affected by tight fit of the cylindrical distal stem. Tightening of the collarless implant by subsidence could not be relied upon to achieve fixation, and may not be reliable in a clinical situation. Improved rigidity of fixation and increased strength achieved by seating on the collar are distinctive advantages for pain control and biologic fixation of noncemented femoral components.\r"

Detection and diagnosis of this localized soft-tissue mass are difficult because plain roentgenograms may be totally within normal limits. The case of a 21-year-old woman illustrates the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an effective technique to define and characterize PVNS. Advantages of MRI include high-resolution/high-contrast multiplanar sections that depict bone, marrow, ligaments and tendons, fat, menisci, and articular cartilage in one image. In addition, MRI is noninvasive and requires no ionized radiation. MRI is an excellent clinical tool for the evaluation of intraarticular tumors of the knee joint.\r"

Rupture occurred in all prostheses placed in double osseous tunnels and in one of 12 prostheses placed by the OTT technique. When rupture occurred in only one fork of prostheses placed in the combined method, all occurred in the tunnel-placed fork. If the results of the three groups are combined, rupture occurred in 16.7% of all OTT-placed prostheses versus 91.3% rupture of all osseous tunnel-placed prostheses. Objective assessment of the in vivo testing clearly indicates that the OTT technique is superior to the tunnel technique under the conditions of this study. The relationship between placement technique and rupture of other prostheses should also be tested in vivo.\r"

The results of the clinical and radiologic evaluations were excellent in 29 fractures, good in 13, fair in two, and poor in one. Interlocking intramedullary nailing proved to be efficient for comminuted, segmental, and unstable tibial fractures, especially in patients with multiple injuries. Compared with conventional intramedullary nailing, the locking procedure increases the stability at the fracture site and extends the indication for nailing to fractures in the proximal and distal diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions.\r"

Measurements of total tibial and cortical widths in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral planes were made on these roentgenograms at two levels: at the point of the narrowest tibial width on AP roentgenograms (Level 1) and at the point of the narrowest width on lateral roentgenograms (Level 2). The tibial cross section was idealized as an eccentric ellipse within an ellipse, and on the basis of measurements taken from the roentgenograms, the cross-sectional area (compression strength), area moments of inertia about AP and mediolateral axes of bending (bending strength), and the area polar moment of inertia (torsional strength) were calculated for each cross section. During the course of 14 weeks of training, 20% of the recruits sustained tibial diaphyseal stress fractures, all of which were along the medial cortex. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis the tibia's bending strength along an AP axis of bedding at Level 2 was found to be the most significant factor determining whether or not a recruit would develop a tibial stress fracture.\r"

Considering currently available bonding strengths, the most reasonable potential application of an osseous adhesive would appear to involve the stabilization of relatively small osteochondral fragments. If used as a means of temporary internal fixation, such an adhesive would need to be used in limited amounts in limited areas to allow for normal healing processes to occur between areas of adhesive placement. An animal study was therefore conducted utilizing the viscous isoamyl-2-cyanoacrylate monomer to evaluate its ability to maintain the reduction of an unstable osteochondral fragment while allowing for healing around the sites of adhesive placement. Used in limited quantities, this monomer appeared to allow adjacent healing to occur unimpeded and to be nontoxic to adjacent viable bone and cartilage. This adhesive also appeared to lend significant stability to the reduction of an osteochondral fragment in the knees of a series of rabbits.\r"

The results for osteoarthritic hips were superior to those with rheumatoid disease. Critical examination of the roentgenograms revealed a higher level of loosening than was suspected clinically, with only one in two hips appearing entirely satisfactory. Although weight gain and previous surgery did not affect the outcome, patients who returned to heavy manual work or athletic activities soon developed loosening. Four of five young patients gained freedom from pain and became fully active at a time when mobility was of crucial importance to both their professional and family lives. Clearly, these results affirm the value of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in young patients with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, although a limited time expectancy of these good results undoubtedly does exist.\r"

  ".W": "Minimal osteonecrosis (MON) is a small and eccentrically localized lesion of osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head. This form of ON shows clinically benign features, but may be indicative of the pathomechanism of ON. Of 180 patients (275 hips) with ON, 15 patients (19 hips) were found to have MON. Based on the geography of the femoral head, the lesions were grouped into four types: anterior (seven hips), superior (six hips), medial (five hips), and lateral (one hip). When the location of the lesion was compared with the normal vascular anatomy, a close correlation between the location and the segmental blood supply in the femoral head became evident. Histologic findings showed localized infarction of the trabeculae and bone marrow, but no evidence suggesting repeated episodes of infarction, which is an essential feature of typical ON. From these findings, MON may be a segmental infarct within the femoral head. Interruption of the blood flow may possibly occur not in the main trunk but in the terminal branch of the lateral epiphyseal or superior metaphyseal artery; such as ischemic event is probably a single brief attack, leading to this form of infarction in contrast to typical ON developing with prolonged or recurrent obstructions.\r"

  ".W": "Large bone defects have become a more common orthopedic problem in recent year. This is due to the increased enthusiasm for limb salvage surgery as a technique to manage patients with primary bone tumors and for patients who have had multiple joint arthroplasties with subsequent bone loss. One technique that has proven successful for this difficult problem is the use of fresh frozen allografts to reconstruct these skeletal defects. From January 1981 until January 1987, 60 large fragment fresh frozen allografts were used for skeletal reconstruction. These grafts were divided into three basic groups: intercalary, 15; osteoarticular, 16; and allograft-prosthetic composite, 29. The diagnoses included 43 bone tumors, 16 failed total hip arthroplasties, and one traumatic bone loss. The average patient age was 39.7 years and had an average follow-up period of 24 months. The average length of allograft was 12.4 cm. Using the Enneking Functional Evaluation System, the final functional analysis revealed excellent or good results in 86% of the patients and fair or poor results in 14% of the patients. Roentgenological union at the allograft-host bone junction was achieved in 90% of the patients in a mean time of 5.8 months after surgery. An additional three patients obtained union after autogeneic bone grafting. At the time of follow-up evaluation, 92.3% of the patients were free of tumor; they had no local recurrences. The use of fresh frozen allografts represents an acceptable alternative for the reconstruction of large skeletal defects. One can expect good or excellent function for the majority of patients. The best functional results were obtained with the intercalary allografts and the allograft-prosthetic composites.\r"

Moore design, cobalt alloy femoral implants with powder-made sintered porous coating on either one-third, two-thirds, or the full implant length were compared radiographically two years after surgery. A semiquantitative method was adopted for assessing resorption that involved dividing the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral roentgenograms into a total of 16 discrete sites. The 16 sites were qualitatively examined for evidence of resorption by either thinning or darkening of bone relative to the time immediately following surgery. Based on the number of sites that demonstrated resorption, the bone loss was classified as either minor and not likely to cause problems (0 to 4 sites) or pronounced and of potentially harmful clinical consequence (5 or more sites). Pronounced resorption occurred in 18% of the 411 cases. The use of larger stems resulted in increased occurrence of marked bone resorption: stems greater than or equal to 13.5 mm in diameter showed five times the incidence of pronounced resorption compared with stems less than or equal to 12.0 mm in diameter. Stems with two-thirds and full porous coating resulted in a twofold to fourfold increase in the incidence of pronounced bone resorption. The theoretic degree of stress shielding of the femoral shaft in bending was calculated for cases with complete canal filling and a radiographic appearance of bone ingrowth. There was a strong correlation between this theoretic factor and the observed bone resorption.\r"

The prosthesis was revised to a total hip arthroplasty 15 years following implantation. That the reason for excision was acetabular wear indicates that the prosthesis was load bearing.

In two of the primary arthroplasties and three of the revision arthroplasties, the loose beads were observed on the immediate postoperative roentgenographs. None of the acetabular components appeared loose by other roentgenographic criteria. The sintering technique used in the manufacture of these implants did not prevent loosening of cobalt chrome beads from porous-coated cobalt chrome acetabular components. A longer follow-up period is required to assess fully the clinical significance.\r"

This had dropped to 140.3 +/- 87 mg/dl by 57 days, a drop of 66 percent. As expected, the lowest IgG levels postnatally was a reflection of the degree of prematurity and the length of postnatal age.

Skeletal muscles containing a predominance of anaerobic (fast-twitch, type II) fibres showed greater changes when compared with skeletal muscles with a predominance of aerobic (slow-twitch, type I) fibres. 3. Gastrocnemius muscles were separated into sarcoplasmic, stromal and myofibrillar protein fractions. Protein synthesis was reduced similarly in all fractions by ethanol treatment, by approximately 30%. 4.

The effects of LTB3 on complement receptor enhancement, chemotaxis and lysozyme release in human neutrophils (PMN) were compared with those of LTB4 and LTB5. 2. LTB3 and LTB4 elicited a virtually identical dose- and time-dependent enhancement in complement receptors type 1 (CR1) and type 3 (CR3) and release of lysozyme. LTB5 was approximately 100 times less potent than LTB4 in enhancing CR1 and CR3, whereas it was 10,000 times less potent than LTB4 in releasing lysozyme from human PMN. 3. LTB3 and LTB5 were respectively 5- and 100-fold less potent than LTB4 in eliciting chemotaxis. 4. These findings indicate that the pro-inflammatory potential of LTB3 and LTB4 are similar, whereas LTB5 is substantially less potent as an inflammatory mediator. 5. The finding that LTB5 is a weak and partial agonist relative to LTB3 and LTB4 could be due to the rigidity of the C-17-C-18 double bond in LTB5. This may interfere with the active site specificity of LTB5 to a substantial extent. 6. One approach to the development of antagonists to the LTB4 receptor may be to establish a rigid structure in the C-17-C-18 region of the LTB4 molecule.\r"

Platelet aggregation and thromboxane generation were measured in response to collagen (0.4-6.3 micrograms/ml) and adenosine 5'-pyrophosphate (0.5-4 mumol/l). 3. The concentration of aspirin needed to inhibit platelet aggregation in response to a critical concentration of aggregating agent (lowest concentration to cause greater than 50% aggregation) was lower than that required for higher concentrations of aggregating agent. 4. With more prolonged incubation times with aspirin, lower concentrations of aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation. 5. Inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane formation by 10 mumol/l aspirin was maximal by 90 min. There was progressive inhibition by 3 mumol/l aspirin during incubation for 270 min. By the end of this time there was also significant inhibition by 1 mumol/l aspirin. 6. The apparent discrepancy between inhibitory aspirin concentrations in vivo and those observed in vitro in previous studies appears to have been resolved by extending the incubation time of platelets with low aspirin concentrations, thus mimicking the conditions in vivo.\r"

Three weeks after partial enterectomy in the rabbit there was an increased somatostatin concentration and a decreased number of somatostatin-binding sites (without changes in the corresponding affinity values) in the cytosol of the residual intestinal tissue, except in the terminal ileum and the colon. 2. Five weeks after surgery both the somatostatin concentration and the number of somatostatin-binding sites returned towards control values. 3. These results suggest that an increase in bowel somatostatin content could lead to down-regulation of somatostatin-binding sites in the intestinal mucosa.\r"

This enabled assessments of the normal variations in pressure which influence fluid filtration and reabsorption. 2. Seventy-eight capillaries in 19 subjects were punctured in one of three positions around the capillary loop with the hand at the level of the sternal angle. Mean pressure around the loop fell from 37.7 +/- 3.7 mmHg (arteriolar limb, mean +/- SEM, n = 12) to 19.4 +/- 1.0 mmHg (apex, n = 25) to 14.6 +/- 0.5 mmHg (venular limb, n = 41) at skin temperatures of 18.7-33.1 degrees C. These values agree closely with Landis' original studies in 1930 [E. Landis (1930) Heart, 15, 209-228]. 3. The mean filtration/reabsorption state of any particular capillary limb was not static because of cardiac, vasomotor and respiratory fluctuations in capillary pressure. From a total of 38 capillaries in which recordings were analysed for 30 s, the fluctuations in pressure were such that 27 capillaries probably had periods of both filtration and reabsorption. 4. Computerized superimposition and coherent averaging of trains of capillary pulses enabled an accurate description of the pulse waveform to be made in three capillaries. This was remarkably similar to waveforms from the radial artery, albeit at reduced amplitude (average 3.6 +/- 3.4 mmHg, mean +/- SD overall). The time for the pulse to travel between the radial artery and the finger capillary was approximately 10 ms, which implies a propagation velocity of several metres per second.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In particular, the intensity of the sensation of breathlessness was quantified using a visual analogue scale and changes were compared with those in objective ventilatory measures. 3. Eleven subjects performed three steady-state work-load exercise tests on different days and 100% O2, 15% O2 or air were randomly administered for a fixed interval during each test. 4. Compared with air breathing, all subjects felt less breathless during 100% O2 breathing, and ten of them felt more breathless when inspiring 15% O2; these changes were reversed on return to air breathing. 5. During and after 100% O2, the time course of changes in breathlessness was similar to those for ear arterial oxygen saturation and minute ventilation such that it could be a secondary response to either. However, during and after inspiration of 15% O2, changes in breathlessness occurred relatively more quickly than those in ventilation, more closely reflecting changes in oxygen saturation; this suggests that hypoxia, per se, could contribute to the genesis of this sensation. 6. Individual variability in breathlessness responses to exercise and changes in inspired oxygen concentration did not correlate with objective ventilatory changes; neither were changes in breathlessness in the group particularly associated with changes in respiratory frequency or tidal volume.\r"

The effect of elective, uncomplicated cholecystectomy on plasma clearances of amino acids and on amino acid-stimulated urea synthesis was investigated in 10 patients, pre-operatively and on the first post-operative day, and compared with six controls treated identically apart from the surgery. 2. A mixture of amino acids was given as a prime-continuous infusion. Steady-state concentrations 75% higher than basal were attained and were maintained for 90 min. The clearances of amino acids were calculated as the ratios between amino acid infusion rate and the concentration. The urea synthesis rate was calculated as urinary excretion corrected for accumulation and intestinal loss. 3. After surgery the fasting plasma concentrations of alanine, arginine, glutamine plus glutamate, glycine, proline, lysine and threonine decreased by 20-30%, but were unchanged in the control group. The plasma clearance of alpha-amino nitrogen increased from 5.1 +/- 1.2 ml/s before surgery (mean +/- SD) to 6.1 +/- 1.1 ml/s (P less than 0.05, paired t-test) after surgery due to increased clearances of the above-mentioned amino acids. In the control group, the clearance decreased from 6.4 +/- 1.6 to 5.9 +/- 1.1 (P less than 0.05, paired t-test). The amino acid-stimulated urea synthesis rate after surgery was 37 +/- 9 mumol of N/s vs 30 +/- 6 (P less than 0.01, paired t-test) in the controls despite a lower alpha-amino nitrogen concentration (4.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/l vs 5.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, P less than 0.05, paired t-test).

To investigate this hypothesis we studied the effect of alpha-methyldopa on alae nasi electromyographic (EMG) activity during hypercapnia. 2. We studied ten healthy subjects and three subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea during CO2-stimulated breathing. In a preliminary study four subjects demonstrated a fall in alae nasi EMG activity 4 h after the ingestion of 500 mg of alpha-methyldopa during CO2 rebreathing. 3. In six additional normal subjects and three subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea, we studied the alae nasi EMG activity during steady-state hypercapnia with PCO2 held constant 5 torr (0.7 kPa) above baseline. On 2 separate days we studied subjects before and 2 h after they had ingested 750 mg of alpha-methyldopa or placebo. 4. In the normal subjects the mean alae nasi EMG activity fell by 34% 2 h after ingestion of alpha-methyldopa (P less than 0.05) without a change in other ventilatory parameters. 5. In the sleep apnoea group the individual mean alae nasi EMG activity fell 16-49%, with ventilation and tidal volume falling in one patient. 6. We conclude that alpha-methyldopa selectively reduces upper airway motor activity.\r"

The muscles of one arm were exercised at short length, and the contralateral muscle at long length. Each contraction lasted approximately 1 s, and was repeated once every 10 s for 30 min. 3. Muscle strength and frequency-force characteristics were measured from isometric contractions before, immediately after and at 24 h intervals for the next 4 days. Muscle tenderness was assessed daily. 4. The muscle strength was reduced by approximately 10% by exercise at short length, and by 30% by exercise at long length. 5. The 20:100 ratio (force generated by stimulation at 20 Hz/force generated at 100 Hz) fell by 30% after exercise at short length and had recovered after 24 h. Exercise at long length reduced this ratio by 65% and the muscles had not fully recovered 4 days later. 6. Muscle pain developed after both exercise regimens, but was slightly worse after that at long length. 7. It is concluded that there is a length-dependent component in the development of pain and fatigue after eccentric exercise, which had previously been thought to be caused solely by high force generation.\r"

Patients were weaned in a standardized fashion and extubated using a standardized gas exchange and mechanics criteria. Of 400 extubations in the general surgical ICU, there were 22 reintubations in 20 patients. Average age was 65 yr, and the major reason for reintubation was need for positive-pressure ventilation. Morbidity (pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia) was 36%, and the inhospital mortality was 40% in this group. The major cause of death was progressive cardiopulmonary failure. There were 10 failures in eight patients, of 300 extubations in the Burn/Trauma unit, where the mean age was 44 yr. Five failures occurred in patients with smoke inhalation and burns, a 13% incidence in this population. The reason for reintubation was airway maintenance and pulmonary toilet. Four failures occurred in head injury patients, a 5% incidence with the major reason for reintubation being airway protection. Morbidity was 60% (new pulmonary infiltrates), while mortality rate was only 10% in this group. Only one failure was noted in a nonhead-injured trauma patient. In no group studied were any predictors of extubation failure detected. We conclude that the incidence, reasons for, and outcome of reintubations in surgical ICU patients varies dramatically depending on the underlying disease process. Overall failure rate was 4%.\r"

Patients were classified into three groups: a) hypotensive (n = 38), those who received vasopressor support for frank hypotension; b) hypertensive (n = 21), those who required vasodilator therapy; and c) normotensive (n = 53), those who required neither vasopressor nor vasodilator therapy. Analysis of variance revealed that only Ca+2, creatinine, and arterial pH differed among the three groups. The difference in Ca+2 persisted when analysis of variance was repeated with creatinine as a covariate. Hypotensive patients had a significantly (p less than .05) lower mean Ca+2 (1.04 +/- 0.13 mmol/L) than normotensive patients (1.13 +/- 0.10 mmol/L), who in turn had a significantly (p less than .05) lower Ca+2 than hypertensive patients (1.18 +/- 0.09 mmol/L). Ca+2 correlated with mean arterial pressure at the time of serum collection (n = 118; r = .43; p less than .01), independent of any other variable. Vasopressor support was required in 41% of hypocalcemic patients in comparison to 14% of normocalcemic patients (p less than .01). Vasodilator therapy was required for 34% of normocalcemic patients, compared to 7.5% of hypocalcemic patients (p less than .01). There appears to be a clinically significant association between hypotension and hypocalcemia. This association may or may not be causal.\r"

Data were measured before and immediately after Intralipid infusion and when serum lipemia cleared. Intralipid infusion precipitated a significant increase in venous admixture (Qsp/Qt) from 13.7 +/- 3.6 (SEM) to 18.0 +/- 6.5% and from 22.0 +/- 4.8 to 25.8 +/- 7.0% in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

When serum lipemia cleared, Qsp/Qt and MPAP returned to preinfusion levels. We conclude that Intralipid infusion increases pulmonary artery pressure and venous admixture in critically ill patients. These changes are temporary and coincidental with serum lipemia rather than presence or absence of sepsis. Adequate levels of oxygenation should be confirmed during Intralipid infusion in patients with borderline oxygenation.\r"

Little correlation was found between individual patient or family member and physician responses (Kendall's Tau ranged from -.14 to .22 depending on how long life was prolonged). Physicians' evaluations of intensive care for patients under ideal life circumstances were strongly correlated with physicians' personal preferences for intensive care (Kendall's Tau, .41 to .65, p less than .02). Because physicians and patients may not agree regarding the value of intensive care, physicians must explicitly discuss patients' preferences in order to reconcile wishes and justifiable needs for critical care.\r"

After the induction of shock, the resuscitative solution was given iv over a 6-h period. RL and albumin in RL resulted in long-term (greater than 7 days) survival in 15 of 16 animals. All animals in the control group and six of eight animals in the SFHS-treated group died within 24 h. Hct was used to estimate changes in intravascular volume. All control animals became hemoconcentrated and exhibited a 50% loss in plasma volume. The failure of SFHS to improve significantly the survival in rats compared to the controls is surprising in view of the fact that the SFHS had the same oncotic pressure as the albumin-containing solution and identical volumes were administered.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between transconjunctival PO2 (PcjO2) and cerebral oxygen delivery (DO2) was examined in dogs during sinus rhythm and CPR with an inflatable vest. Microsphere-determined cerebral blood flow (CBF), DO2, and PcjO2 readings were normal during sinus rhythm. During CPR, with carotid pressure of 82 +/- 11/25 +/- 5 (SEM) mm Hg, cerebral perfusion and DO2 fell by 53% and 57%, respectively, while PcjO2 fell by 87%. After epinephrine administration, carotid pressure increased to 128 +/- 13/48 +/- 9 mm Hg, and CBF and DO2 rose to 130% and 115% of pre-arrest levels, respectively, but PcjO2 readings remained at 11% of control values. Thus, PcjO2 failed to reflect accurately either CBF or DO2 during CPR. In the presence of epinephrine, PcjO2 does not seem to provide an accurate index of the effectiveness of CPR.\r"

  ".W": "A method for pediatric airway support was evaluated for the situation when mask ventilation or intubation is impossible. Mongrel dogs were sedated, intubated, and allowed to breathe room air for 30 min. Baseline variables were recorded, and the airway obstructed. After 2 to 3 min of hypoxia, arterial blood gas and hemodynamic data were again recorded. A percutaneous cricothyroid membrane puncture (PCMP) was then performed with a 12-ga iv catheter. Studies were carried out both in the presence and absence of spontaneous ventilatory efforts. With spontaneous ventilation, continuous low flow (1.0 L/min) oxygen insufflation provided oxygenation for 30 min and reversed increases in mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance that had been produced by the obstruction. Respiratory acidosis occurred but was well tolerated. With paralyzed animals, whose ventilation was supported by a self-inflating bag with 10.0 L/min of oxygen, all hemodynamic variables except PAP returned to normal, oxygenation was excellent, and PaCO2 values were maintained at steady, but elevated levels. Complications included bilateral tension pneumothorax in one animal. This experimental study supports anecdotal experiences where PCMP has been used and has proven lifesaving when standard resuscitative measures to establish a clear airway have failed.\r"

Mean catheter duration was 27 days (range 1 to 138). Catheter duration was significantly (p less than .01) longer in the 16 cases complicated by thrombosis. There was no significant difference in the frequency of thrombosis between men and women. Two patients developed symptoms of subclavian vein occlusion after the creation of an arteriovenous fistula on the same side as a previous hemodialysis catheter. Overall, thrombosis was found in 23% and increased with longer catheter duration. We recommend phlebography to exclude thrombosis before creating an arteriovenous fistula on the same side as the previous hemodialysis catheter.

In both groups, critical values of DO2 or SvO2 associated with lactic acidosis could not be identified. The DO2 ranged from 136 to 811 ml/min.m2 and SvO2 ranged from 28% to 73% in the patients with sepsis. The DO2 ranged from 115 to 434 ml/min.m2 and SvO2 from 17% to 72% in patients with AMI.

Shift from dopamine to dobutamine resulted in significant increases in stroke index from 28.1 +/- 3.6 to 31.0 +/- 3.8 ml/m2 (p less than .01) and significant decreases in pulmonary artery balloon-occluded pressure from 15.1 +/- 1.0 to 13.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (p less than .05) and right atrial pressure (RAP) from 14.0 +/- 1.3 to 12.2 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p less than .05). RVEF increased slightly but significantly from 21.5 +/- 2.7% to 23.7 +/- 2.9% (p less than .01) so that RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDVI) was unchanged (140 +/- 12 vs. 141 +/- 12 ml, nonsignificant). RVEDVI/RAP ratio increased from 11.3 +/- 1.0 to 12.9 +/- 1.1 ml/mm Hg (p = .037). These results support the view that dobutamine has more favorable effects on RV function than dopamine in critically ill patients in the absence of profound hypotension and also indicates that higher filling pressures under dopamine administration can be related to changes in ventricular pressure/volume relationship.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to assess the role of gallium-67 lung scintigrams in the evaluation of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Images and laboratory studies were evaluated in 54 patients who had chest radiographs and scintigraphic studies during amiodarone treatment of more than one month's duration among 561 patients receiving the medication for refractory arrhythmias. There were 22 patients with pulmonary symptoms and clinical evidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (group 1); 19 patients had other causes for pulmonary symptoms (group 2); and 21 patients were without symptoms or other clinical evidence of pulmonary toxicity (group 3). There was no difference among groups in treatment duration or total amiodarone dose. Symptomatic presentation could not differentiate between group 1 and group 2 patients. However, radiographic findings of isolated pulmonary congestion or a normal radiograph in the presence of symptoms made amiodarone toxicity unlikely, while the appearance of new, dense radiographic infiltrates--often in a nodular distribution--were more frequent among group 1 patients (p less than 0.01). During symptomatic periods, 18 of 22 group 1 patients had abnormal gallium lung uptake, while four revealed more subtle serial changes but there was only one abnormal scintigram among symptomatic group 2 patients. Nonspecific radiographic abnormalities in patients with pulmonary symptoms on amiodarone therapy were rarely attributed to toxicity in the presence of a normal scintigram. One group 3 patient developed scintigraphic abnormalities early during amiodarone treatment, suggesting toxicity in the presence of a normal chest x-ray examination. Comparison of radiographic and scintigraphic studies performed during symptoms with those performed prior to symptom development best indicated the diagnosis, while comparison with later images assessed the efficacy of treatment. Diffusion capacity testing and transbronchial biopsy were sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of amiodarone toxicity. Gallium image abnormalities parallel the development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and aid this diagnosis, especially when the chest radiograph is abnormal and ambiguous. Serial increments in scintigraphic abnormality appear especially helpful for diagnosis in the population at risk.\r"

Fifty-eight patients had a SPN and met the criteria for inclusion in this series. Twenty-five of these (43 percent) were diagnosed by TTNAB; 24 had malignant lesions; one had M tuberculosis. Of the remaining 33 patients, 18 went on to definitive diagnostic procedures (surgery, repeat FOB or TTNAB). Nine of these patients had a malignancy. Fifteen patients were followed long-term; one was diagnosed with carcinoma two years after the initial work-up. Carcinoma was not found in any patient under 40 years of age. A benign lesion was diagnosed by TTNAB in only two patients. We conclude that TTNAB is a valuable procedure in the evaluation of patients with a SPN and negative FOB. While a negative FOB and TTNAB do not assure that the lesion is benign, a complex of variables influences the decision regarding thoracotomy vs careful follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of oral administration of pimobendane on hemodynamics, blood gas levels, the renin-angiotensin system, and plasma catecholamines in 11 patients who were affected by severe chronic congestive heart failure. Following the administration of 5 mg, the cardiac index increased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.01), and the pulmonary wedge pressure decreased from 28 +/- 3 to 17 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The maximal changes were noted five hours after intake of the drug. In spite of a significant decrease in arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) (from 81 +/- 4 to 67 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), a significant increase in the oxygen delivery index was seen (from 322 +/- 32 to 436 +/- 38 ml/min/m2; p less than 0.01). The patients who were submitted to long-term treatment (5 mg twice daily) and who were reassessed after at least one month exhibited an improved cardiac index from 1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.1 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.01), as well as a decreased pulmonary wedge pressure from 26 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The norepinephrine levels were significantly reduced after one month (from 1,496 +/- 185 to 678 +/- 95 pg/ml; p less than 0.01), whereas the plasma renin activity was not. One patient died suddenly during the one-month follow-up period. With the exception of one case, which was also treated with heparin, a transient cutaneous rash and a drop in the level of blood platelets were observed, pimobendane was well tolerated. This new inotropic and vasodilating drug thus seems to have promise for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure.\r"

This worsening was quantified as desaturation surface accumulated within five minutes of exercise and was expressed in arbitrary units (au). Each patient carried out the same exercise three times, in a randomized fashion (breathing air or breathing supplemental oxygen [3 L/min] delivered by either nasal prongs or by oxygen economizer). In patients with obstructive disease, delta SaO2 was reduced from 38 +/- 12.0 au when they were breathing air to 18.1 +/- 11.7 au when breathing oxygen by nasal prongs (p less than 0.001) and to 10.1 +/- 9.5 au when breathing oxygen by economizer (p less than 0.001). In patients with restrictive disease, delta SaO2 was reduced from 35.6 +/- 9.9 au when breathing air to 14.9 +/- 10.2 au breathing oxygen by nasal prongs (p less than 0.01) and to 13.7 +/- 10.3 au breathing oxygen by economizer (p less than 0.01). The difference between breathing by economizer and nasal prongs was significant (paired t-test; p less than 0.01) only in patients with COPD. One explanation could lie in the different values of the respiratory rate, which was significantly greater in patients with restrictive disease (20.7 +/- 1.2 breaths per minute at rest and 25.8 +/- 1.5 with exercise) than in patients with obstructive disease (15.3 +/- 1.2 breaths per minute at rest and 20.8 +/- 1.4 with exercise).\r"

Autonomic influence on the JRTs was evaluated by intravenous administration of atropine (1.5 mg) alone or in combination with propranolol (5 to 6 mg). Of the seven patients in whom MJRTc and/or MJRT could be measured before and after drug intervention, the JRTs shortened in four and prolonged in three after combination of atropine and propranolol. Atropine alone shortened MJRT in all eight patients studied. Our data reveal that both vagal and catecholamine-dependent factors (especially vagal over-activity) are operative in the escape mechanism of the junctional tissue.\r"

Infectious HIV was present in the cellular fraction from two of the 23 consecutive patients and in the patient with LIP. No virus was isolated from the cell-free portion of the centrifuged fluids. The patients from whom HIV was cultured were not distinguishable from other patients by clinical, radiographic, or laboratory data, and their subsequent course did not appear to differ. One patient with a positive HIV culture had organizing pneumonia without evidence of LIP at autopsy three weeks after lavage. This study demonstrates that HIV can be cultured from cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and suggests that its presence is not associated with a single specific pulmonary histologic pattern.\r"

The diagnosis often has been delayed because a lung perfusion scan demonstrated modest defects thought to be incompatible with severe vascular obstruction. To define the relationships between perfusion scan abnormalities, angiographic findings, and hemodynamic data, we analyzed 25 consecutive patients with chronic major vessel thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension who subsequently underwent thromboendarterectomy. We found that the perfusion lung scan consistently caused us to underestimate the severity of pulmonary arterial obstruction as defined by pulmonary angiography. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the severity of hemodynamic compromise and the extent of obstruction defined by perfusion scan or angiogram. These findings suggest that, when pulmonary hypertension is known or suspected, the diagnosis of correctable, chronic major vessel obstruction should be pursued by angiography and hemodynamic assessment even though the perfusion scan may demonstrate only two segmental defects.\r"

Cough was induced by inhalation of ultrasonically nebulized distilled water and hypotonic saline solution. All treatments significantly reduced the cough response to inhaled distilled water aerosol when compared with placebo (p less than 0.001). There was no difference between oxitropium bromide and ipratropium bromide (p greater than 0.05), but the combination preparation displayed a greater antitussive effect than either oxitropium bromide (p less than 0.05) or ipratropium bromide (p less than 0.025). Cough frequencies in response to hypotonic 0.18 and 0.32 percent saline aerosol were lower than those obtained with distilled water (p less than 0.005) for all treatments. Asthmatic patients coughed less frequently than normal volunteers in response to all solutions when placebo was given (p less than 0.05), but there is no evidence to suggest that the response to treatment was different in the two groups.

Six of these patients (group 1A) had similar testing two to four weeks later. Six control subjects (group 2) had repeated exercise tests without isotope study. Group 1 left ventricular ejection fraction response (LVEF) was normal. LVEF at similar workloads did not differ in group 1A (p = NS). However, unlike group 2 results, the linear regression line relating double product to exercise stage in group 1A was higher at first exercise (p less than 0.05), probably due to the effects of alcohol withdrawal. We conclude that radionuclide left ventriculographic findings in these patients do not support the concept of a preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy made apparent by exercise, and exercise very early after alcohol withdrawal is associated with an increased myocardial oxygen demand at any given workload.\r"

Different variables, including cephalometric landmarks, body mass index (BMI), and polygraphic results (particularly degree of O2 saturation and number of abnormal breathing events), were statistically analyzed. As a rule, OSAS patients had upper airway anatomic abnormalities and an elevated BMI: massive obesity was associated with less anatomic abnormality, less nocturnal sleep disruption, and longer total sleep time (TST). Patients having a high respiratory disturbance index (RDI) were more likely to have upper airway anatomic abnormalities; they slept for a shorter time and had increased stage 1 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but decreased stage 3 and 4 and REM sleep. Long mandibular plane to hyoid bone (MP-H) distance and width of the posterior airway space (PAS) (space behind the base of the tongue) were statistically significant predictors of elevated RDI. The cephalometric variables were much less useful for predicting frequency of O2 saturation drops below 80 percent. The patient population can be subdivided into (a) patients with clear anatomic abnormalities and low BMI, (b) patients with morbid obesity with few abnormal cephalometric measurements, and (c) patients who have variably increased BMI and abnormal cephalometric measurements. This is the largest group. We concluded that standardized cephalometric roentgenograms can be useful in determining the appropriate treatment for OSAS patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if the timing of interposed abdominal compressions (IAC) affects the augmented blood flow during this form of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), we performed early-onset or late-onset abdominal compressions at three vascular volumes in nine dogs. Early-onset IAC began immediately following chest compression; we predicted that this would act primarily by emptying the aorta and sustaining the elevated intrathoracic pressure. Late-onset IAC began one-fourth to one-third of the time into diastole; this would have primarily increased venous return. We measured carotid blood flow (electromagnetic flow probe) and right atrial (Pra), thoracic aortic (Pta), abdominal aortic (Paa), and intra-abdominal pressures. The IAC-CPR increased carotid blood flow compared with conventional CPR (22.8 +/- 13.1 percent vs 8.7 +/- 5.8 percent of control; p less than 0.003), but there was no difference between the early and late modes of IAC (22.7 +/- 11.6 percent vs 22.9 +/- 14.7 percent of control). The increase in carotid blood flow was present with the first abdominal compression and was constant over the 40 to 60 seconds of CPR. Peak Pra, Pta, and Paa were similar during abdominal compression (91.8 +/- 16.9 mm Hg, 96.1 +/- 16.0 mm Hg, and 102.4 +/- 15.2 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001). The Pta-Pra diastolic gradient was 18.0 +/- 8.2 mm Hg for early-onset and 20.6 +/- 7.5 mm Hg for late-onset compression (not significant). We conclude that increased carotid blood flow in IAC-CPR in the dog is principally due to the increased pressure in a common thoracoabdominal unit.\r"

Arterial blood obtained from 20 patients undergoing CPR and from 30 healthy volunteers was analyzed for Na+, pH, PCO2, and total CO2 content (tCO2). pK' was calculated from this data, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Total CO2 was then calculated in the CPR patients, using this equation and the control pK'. Mean pK' was 6.109 +/- 0.004 (SEM) for the control group and 6.123 +/- 0.007 for the CPR group (p = NS). In the CPR group, calculated tCO2 was not significantly different from measured from tCO2, and the correlation between calculated and measured tCO2 was 0.99. In patients undergoing CPR, pK' does not differ significantly from normal, and tCO2 can be accurately estimated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\r"

We evaluated the safety of ribavirin aerosol in eight elderly volunteers at high risk for influenza. Their mean age was 64 years; seven subjects had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subjects received ribavirin aerosol for two or six hours with six hours between treatments. Regimens were continued for 96 hours. The drug was well tolerated. Subjects receiving ribavirin for 2 hours demonstrated a significant decrease in their forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow rate and flow over the middle 50 percent of the forced vital capacity. These changes were small and the subjects' symptoms remained stable. Subjects receiving ribavirin for 6 hours had no significant changes in pulmonary function. We conclude that ribavirin aerosol is safe in elderly patients with underlying COPD.\r"

The three events related to exercise testing involved patients with atypical chest pain which, in retrospect, probably reflected unstable angina pectoris or coronary vasospasm (or both). Prompt coronary angiography with subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed. Two cardiac arrests (one fatal) occurred during participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs. One was caused by primary ventricular fibrillation. Electrophysiologic testing was used in determining the efficacy of the drug. The fatality was due to an acute myocardial infarction. On-site intravenous thrombolytic therapy might prove useful in similar events in the future. Comparisons of surveys published in the 1970s with those in the 1980s show that the mortality and morbidity during exercise testing remain low and that similar rates during cardiac rehabilitation are even lower; however, these cases exemplify that emergency situations can and do arise, necessitating prompt intervention and aggressive subsequent management.\r"

  ".W": "At present, there is no sensitive and specific test to confirm the clinical impression that a respiratory disorder is due to aspiration of gastric contents. Since intravenous technetium pertechnetate (99mTcO4-) has been shown to be safe, actively concentrated in the gastrointestinal tract, and secreted into gastric juice, we sought to determine whether 99mTcO4-, when given intravenously, is suitable to detect pulmonary aspiration of small amounts of gastric contents in rabbits. Biodistribution studies over 24 h revealed that 99mTcO4- persistently appeared in the stomach, thyroid, and salivary glands and did not appear in the lungs. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 99mTcO4- was rapidly picked up by the stomach wall and secreted promptly into the stomach lumen and that the stomach wall persistently secreted 99mTcO4- into stomach contents for 24 h. By injecting 99mTcO4- through an intratracheal catheter in order to simulate aspiration, the radioactive threshold for imaging intrapulmonary 99mTcO4- was determined to range between less than 0.5 microCi and 2 microCi, depending on the amount of background activity in the blood pool. By measuring the radioactivity in stomach contents (microCi/g), over 24 h after intravenous injection of 2 mCi of 99mTcO4-, we were able to calculate the amount of aspirated stomach contents that our technique should reveal at various time points. We concluded from this preliminary feasibility study that 99mTcO4-, when given intravenously, is suitable to detect pulmonary aspiration of small amounts (less than or equal to 4 ml for 8 h after an intravenous dose of 2 mCi) of gastric contents in human patients. Since our biodistribution studies show that saliva as well as stomach contents are potential sources for any aspirated 99mTcO4-, how to distinguish aspiration of oropharyngeal from stomach contents remains to be determined. It also remains to be determined how long 99mTcO4- remains in the lungs after it has been instilled; clearance that is too rapid significantly decreases the ability of this agent to reveal aspiration.\r"

After death from congestive right heart failure, autopsy revealed histologic signs of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). An accessory arterial vessel that was thrombotically occluded was found connecting the ascending aorta and the right pulmonary hilum. There was also histologic evidence of arterial thrombi within the right lung arterial vascular bed. The PH in UARPA usually occurs very early during the course of disease. From histologic findings and medical history, it is likely that in this case, late-onset elevation of pulmonary pressures was triggered by the occurrence of PVOD. This is the first case of UARPA and PVOD--a congenital unilateral arterial malformation in the presence of bilateral involvement in a possibly acquired venous obliterative disease.\r"

Polysomnography showed hypopneas associated with O2 desaturation episodes, and no apnea; maximal changes were noted during REM sleep. A few months later, in spite of marked weight loss, acute alveolar hypoventilation occurred and necessitated mechanical ventilatory support. Tracheostomy was performed. The patient appeared to be dependent on nocturnal ventilatory assistance. Diaphragmatic paralysis was noted in addition to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While the patient was not ventilated, a nocturnal recording of SaO2 again revealed desaturation episodes partly corrected by O2 2 L/min administered through the tracheostomy tube. With volume-controlled ventilation, desaturations completely disappeared, although no oxygen enrichment of the air was provided. We speculate that sleep disorders with hypopneas and O2 desaturation episodes were the initial symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This leads us to suggest that nonspecific respiratory muscle fatigue frequently seen in COPD might be included in the hypothetic causes of nocturnal hypoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "Sleep-related gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal acid clearance have been shown to be important components in the pathogenesis of reflux esophageal disease. Previous studies have suggested that patients with more severe esophagitis are distinguished by an accumulation of acid mucosal contact time during sleep. These data would suggest that patients with Barrett's esophagus should have particularly severe impairment of acid clearance, most notable during sleep. To address this issue, 16 asymptomatic healthy volunteers and 13 patients with Barrett's esophagus were studied. Acid clearance was assessed by timing the reestablishment of an esophageal pH of 4 following the infusion of 15 ml 0.1 N HCl. Sleep was polygraphically monitored in order to objectively determine sleep and waking. The results indicated that while patients with Barrett's esophagus had a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux during sleep, they unexpectedly demonstrated faster acid clearance times during both waking and sleep. A greater percentage of arousal responses to acid infusion during sleep was noted in the Barrett's group. It is concluded from these results that patients with Barrett's esophagus can adequately clear acid from the distal esophagus but experience considerable acid mucosal contact through repeated episodes of spontaneous reflux during sleep.\r"

A prospective, double-blind endoscopy study was performed in 40 healthy adults. After baseline normal endoscopy, 20 subjects were randomly assigned to either indomethacin (25 mg four times daily) or carprofen (150 mg twice daily) for eight days and re-endoscoped. Urinary and gastric mucosal prostaglandin generation, respectively, of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, and PGE and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was determined. Minor subjective symptoms occurred in six of 20 indomethacin (including four of eight with gastrointestinal injury) and in three of 20 carprofen subjects. Indomethacin and carprofen reduced gastric and urinary prostaglandin synthesis to a similar degree. Gastrointestinal injury was present in eight of 20 indomethacin and in none of 20 carprofen subjects. This study fails to establish a relationship between duodenal mucosal lesions and gastric prostanoid generation and confirms the lack of correlation between indomethacin-induced duodenal injury and subjective symptomatology. Carprofen appears to produce less objective damage in the upper gastrointestinal tract than indomethacin at comparable clinical doses.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial transformation of bile acids is possibly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. In several epidemiological studies, the secondary bile acid concentration in feces is related to the incidence of colonic cancer. However, data on fecal bile acids in case-control studies are conflicting. We investigated the influence of age, intestinal transit time, and dietary composition on fecal bile acid profiles in healthy subjects of three different age groups (mean ages 22, 48, and 67 years). Fecal bile acids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The concentration of the major secondary fecal bile acids increased with advancing age and was significantly higher in elderly subjects, compared to young adults. The concentration in middle-aged persons was intermediate. Analysis of dietary constituents showed that the fat intake in the three groups was comparable. The dietary fiber intake in elderly subjects was significantly lower than in the other two groups. The former group did excrete less dry fecal material compared to both other groups. Dietary fiber intake was negatively correlated with the total bile acid concentration. Probably, a decrease in dietary fiber intake results in higher fecal bile acid concentrations with advancing age. From the findings of this study, it is obvious that matching for age is important when case-control studies concerning the role of fecal bile acids in colorectal carcinogenesis are conducted.\r"

When combined with the presupposed IgA-clearance function of the liver, a causal association between IgA abnormalities and the liver disease in ALD can be suggested. This prompted us to study the presence and concentration of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes (IgA-CIC) in 41 patients with ALD and 41 patients with other nonalcoholic liver diseases having comparable serum IgA levels. We searched for relationships among IgA-CIC and history of alcohol abuse, liver histopathology, and IgA deposits in the liver. Using an anti-IgA inhibition binding assay, 56% of the patients exhibited IgA-CIC in polyethylene glycol precipitate of serum and 38% showed IgA-CIC in whole serum. The prevalence and concentration of IgA-CIC was lowest in cases with nonspecific changes or steatosis in the liver biopsy and highest in cases with hepatitis or cirrhosis (P less than 0.01). The occurrence of IgA-CIC was not related to a history of alcohol abuse or to the presence of IgA deposits along hepatic sinusoids (which occurred in 78% of ALD and 20% of non-ALD cases). A skin biopsy was available from 34 patients (19 with ALD and 15 with non-ALD). In 68% of these biopsies, IgA deposits were observed in superficial blood capillaries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies were done at normal bile flow and at sodium taurocholate-stimulated bile flow. The results showed that biliary calcium secretion, which could occur in the absence of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, was dependent mainly on plasma calcium concentration and was only partly influenced by bile acid secretion. Concerning the route of biliary calcium secretion, 80% was by the transcellular pathway and 20% was by the paracellular pathway. During theophylline-stimulated bile-acid-independent bile flow, the increase in bile-acid-independent calcium was found to be secreted by both pathways.\r"

  ".U": "88224525\r", 
  ".W": "Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency has been observed in some diabetics with peripheral neuropathy and diarrhea. Several mechanisms may be responsible for this insufficiency: (1) pancreatic atrophy, (2) disruption of the cholinergic enteropancreatic reflexes, or (3) elevated serum levels of peptides such as glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide which are known to inhibit pancreatic exocrine secretion. To clarify the mechanism(s) involved in this exocrine pancreatic impairment, we studied 10 diabetics with diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy. Their results were compared to those of eight normal volunteers. Each subject underwent a standardized pancreatic function study which assessed nonstimulated secretion, the response to intrajejunal infusion of a mixture of amino acids, and the output following intravenous administration of secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK). In separate studies, the effect of a background infusion of bethanechol and secretin on the pancreatic response to CCK was assessed in six patients and six normal controls. Compared to normals, all diabetics exhibited a significant reduction in both enzyme and bicarbonate secretion to all stimuli. This reduction was not corrected by administering bethanechol. Plasma glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide levels in diabetics were not significantly higher than those in controls. We conclude that diabetics with diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy exhibit impairment of their exocrine pancreatic secretion and possible mechanisms for this are discussed.\r"

Results indicated significantly lower endogenous bile acid concentrations in the stool water phase, obtained by centrifugation, in the CF patients (12.0 +/- 3.5%), compared with the controls (25.5 +/- 8.1%). In vitro incorporation of labeled cholic acid (CA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) demonstrated a stronger binding of both to the particulate matter of stools in the CF group. Using equilibrium dialysis, the calculated concentrations of unbound CA and DCA in the CF group measured 0.78 and 0.3 mumol/g homogenate, respectively, and in the control patients 1.76 and 1.39 mumol/g homogenate, respectively. Partial release of bile acids from CF stool pellets was achieved by the addition of trypsin and elastase, as well as by alkalinization. It is suggested that in patients with CF, stool bile acids are bound to the undigested protein fraction, which makes them unavailable for colonic resorption.\r"

Capsule pressures obtained with each capsule, using rabbit mesenteric vessels comparable in size to human esophageal varices, were correlated with direct intraluminal pressure measurements. There was an excellent correlation between capsule pressure measurements obtained with the small capsule and intraluminal pressure (r2 = 0.97) which was significantly greater than the correlation obtained when the initial capsule was studied (r2 = 0.89, P less than 0.01). The variability of capsule pressure measurements obtained with the small capsule was less than that observed when measurements were obtained with the initial capsule (P less than 0.01). Therefore, this new small capsule should provide the most accurate and reproducible noninvasive measurements of variceal pressure.\r"

As for group I specifically, colonic ulcerations due to Cytomegalovirus were present in all the patients, varying from punctate and superficial erosions to deep ulcerations, with granular and friable intervening mucosa. Severe colonic lesions appeared during the course of Cytomegalovirus colitis in two patients who developed lethal necrotizing colitis.

A pharmacoepidemiologist must be capable of functioning with a matrix constructed of three components: a knowledge base, a conceptual framework, and an interpretive framework. From this perspective one can establish surveillance schemes, or understand a posed research question, select strategies, apply methodologies, and interpret the results of purposeful investigations. When conveyed to the risk manager, appropriately interpreted results of a properly conducted risk assessment can be used in regulatory decision making. Seven case studies are presented as examples of this approach.\r"

  ".W": "The intracellular location of estrogen receptors in hormone-responsive cells has been studied with a number of techniques which indicate that the unoccupied receptors are nuclear and not cytoplasmic proteins. We used cell enucleation of two human breast cancer-derived cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D, to determine whether the unoccupied receptors were also nuclear in these cells and to determine whether the weak estrogen phenol red, present in nearly all tissue culture media, affected the distribution of the receptors seen with this technique. Nucleoplasts prepared from the breast cancer cells contained most of the estrogen receptors that were present in whole cells. The cytoplast fraction, which contained some contaminating whole cells, also contained some receptors. However, incubating cells with estradiol before enucleation did not translocate any receptors out of the cytoplast fraction (to the nucleoplasts). The unoccupied receptors appeared to be almost exclusively nuclear in these cells. The same results were obtained with either radioligand binding or enzyme-linked immunoassay used to measure estrogen receptor, and the distribution of receptors was unaffected by the presence of the pH indicator phenol red. In addition, we observed changes in the estrogen receptor content of incubated cytoplasts that were consistent with receptor synthesis, and this may prove to be a useful model system to characterize receptor synthesis and degradation.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of gastrin-releasing peptide-27 (GRP) into the third ventricle (IVT) has been shown previously to lower plasma GH levels and block the GH release induced by GRF, suggesting that GRP might act via stimulation of the release of somatostatin (SRIF) into hypophysial portal vessels. Several experiments were performed to test this hypothesis. In the first experiment rat median eminence (ME) fragments were incubated in medium containing concentrations of GRP ranging from 1 pM to 1 microM, and SRIF levels were measured after the 30-min incubation period. GRP significantly stimulated SRIF release at doses of 0.1 nM to 1 microM. Microinjection of SRIF antiserum (3 microliters) IVT prevented GRP (2 micrograms, IVT) from inhibiting the GH surge induced by GRF (1 microgram/kg, iv). A slight but significant decrease in basal plasma GH levels was observed after GRP administration even in the presence of SRIF antiserum. Finally, to rule out a GRP-GRF interaction at the pituitary level, tubes containing dispersed rat pituitary cells (2.5 x 10(5) cells/tube) were incubated for 1.5 h in medium containing various concentrations of GRF (0.4-40 nM) alone or with 0.1 microM GRP. The addition of GRP to the medium had no significant effect on the dose-dependent stimulation of GH release by GRF. The results of these studies demonstrate that GRP can directly stimulate SRIF release in vitro. They further suggest that SRIF is a component of the mechanism whereby GRP inhibits GH release in vivo. Finally, the possibility that GRP acts at the pituitary level to inhibit GH release by blocking GRF receptors on somatotrophs has been ruled out.\r"

  ".W": "A comprehensive multicompartmental kinetic model was developed to account for the distribution and metabolism of simultaneously injected radioactive iodide (iodide*), T3 (T3*), and T4 (T4*) in six normal and seven spontaneously hyperthyroid cats. Data from plasma samples (analyzed by HPLC), urine, feces, and thyroid accumulation were incorporated into the model. The submodels for iodide*, T3*, and T4* all included both a fast and a slow exchange compartment connecting with the plasma compartment. The best-fit iodide* model also included a delay compartment, presumed to be pooling of gastrosalivary secretions. This delay was 62% longer in the hyperthyroid cats than in the euthyroid cats. Unexpectedly, all of the exchange parameters for both T4 and T3 were significantly slowed in hyperthyroidism, possibly because the hyperthyroid cats were older. None of the plasma equivalent volumes of the exchange compartments of iodide*, T3*, or T4* was significantly different in the hyperthyroid cats, although the plasma equivalent volume of the fast T4 exchange compartments were reduced. Secretion of recycled T4* from the thyroid into the plasma T4* compartment was essential to model fit, but its quantity could not be uniquely identified in the absence of multiple thyroid data points. Thyroid secretion of T3* was not detectable. Comparing the fast and slow compartments, there was a shift of T4* deiodination into the fast exchange compartment in hyperthyroidism. Total body mean residence times (MRTs) of iodide* and T3* were not affected by hyperthyroidism, but mean T4* MRT was decreased 23%. Total fractional T4 to T3 conversion was unchanged in hyperthyroidism, although the amount of T3 produced by this route was increased nearly 5-fold because of higher concentrations of donor stable T4. Analysis of the data indicates that the increased overall T4* turnover (decreased MRT) in hyperthyroidism is due to increased losses through pathways other than T3 formation. Conjugation, with subsequent deiodination, is proposed as one possibly important pathway. Results of this multicompartmental analysis are compared with those of noncompartmental analysis of the same data and with results of similar model analyses in other species.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized binding proteins for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in hepatic subcellular fractions and in the washed supernatants of these fractions in normal and hypophysectomized (hypox) rats. In the course of assessing IGF-II-binding sites on rat liver microsomes, we observed that [125I] IGF-II binding to the microsomal membranes of hypox rats was much lower than that in normal rats. Paradoxically, binding increased in hypox animals at low concentrations (0.5-5 ng/ml) of unlabeled IGF-II. After resuspension and centrifugation (washing) of the microsomes, no difference was found in [125I]IGF-II binding to hypox vs. normal microsomes. However, the binding of [125I]IGF-II to the washing supernatant (SN) from hypox rat microsomes was greater than binding to that from normal animals. Binding to SN was inhibited by unlabeled IGF-II in a dose-dependent manner. Scatchard analyses indicated that the affinity constant for binding by hypox SN was higher than that of normal SN and the microsomal fractions of both hypox and normal rats. After further subfractionation of the liver, no binding activity was found in SN from plasmalemma, whereas it was about 20% of input counts per min of [125I]IGF-II in SN from combined Golgi-endosome fractions of hypox rat liver. We next compared IGF-binding moieties in microsomal SN with those in plasma using cross-linking of [125I]IGF-II followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In normal rat plasma, we observed the presence of 42K, 39K, 31K, and 27K binding complexes. In hypox rat plasma only a 42-39K doublet was found. In the SN of normal rat microsomes, the predominant complex migrated at 39K and was distinguishable only after acidification. In the SN of hypox rat microsomes, the 42K complex was predominant, with a minor 34K complex. These studies have identified IGF-binding moieties in hepatic tissues, particularly in hepatic vesicular elements, which interfere in the binding of IGF-II to membrane receptors. Their presence in these receptor-rich elements may influence IGF binding to intracellular receptors and, hence, the biological activity of the peptide.\r"

This procedure decreased thyroid [3H]choline uptake by about half. Bilaterally ILN-sectioned rats treated with methylmercaptoimidazole for 4 days exhibited a significant impairment of the methylmercaptoimidazole-induced goitrogenic response. Unilateral ILN section resulted in further atrophy of the ipsilateral thyroid lobe in hypophysectomized rats. One week after ILN section a significant decrease of serum T4 and an increase of serum TSH were observed. Bilateral ILN section generally decreased circulating T4 for up to 28 days after surgery, while a unilateral ILN section caused a transient T4 decrease for 1 week after surgery. Compensatory thyroid growth in rats subjected to unilateral thyroidectomy (hemi Tx) and ILN section performed ipsilaterally to the remaining lobe, was significantly smaller than that of rats subjected to hemi Tx alone. Hemi Tx depressed serum T4 and increased serum TSH levels significantly. These hormonal changes were prevented by unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx), but were unaffected by ILN section. The combination of SCGx and ILN section negated the facilitating effect of SCGx on thyroid secretion and impaired the increase in compensatory thyroid growth brought about by thyroid sympathetic denervation. Thyroid mitotic index studies in hemi Tx rats receiving ILN section, SCGx, or a combination of both indicated that the increase in the number of follicular mitosis caused by hemi Tx was significantly impaired by ILN section and was significantly increased by SCGx. SCGx potentiation of thyroid follicular mitotic activity was partially prevented by concomitant ILN section. These results support a significant role of thyroid sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation in the control of organ's growth and secretory activity.\r"

Saturation analyses of cytosol from hypothalamus-preoptic area (POA)-amygdala regions and anterior pituitary revealed receptors (ARc) with apparent Kd values of 2.52 and 3.83 X 10(-10) M, respectively. Nuclear salt extracts from the same tissues contained receptors (ARn) with Kd values of 4.38 and 5.12 X 10(-10) M. Reproductive behavior of 10 males was observed with receptive females for 10 min once a week. After 4 weeks, half of the animals received 10 mg progesterone (P)/day for an additional 4 weeks. P treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) increased latency to first mount and decreased mounts per test period. After behavioral testing, analysis of the AR content of specific brain regions revealed that the highest concentrations of ARc and ARn were in the POA and medial basal hypothalamus, and the lowest were in the cerebral cortex. The ARn content was significantly suppressed in POA and medial basal hypothalamus (P less than 0.05) from P-treated males compared to the control value. These data show that AR content is highest in areas thought to control behavior and gonadotropin release within the brain of the male guinea pig. In addition, the antiandrogenic actions of P on the central nervous system, which in this experiment were expressed as a significant decline in reproductive behavior, may be explained by its interference with the retention of the AR in the nucleus.\r"

However, when present at lower concentrations recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) (400 pg/ml), hIGF-II (0.4 pg/ml), and MSA (40 pg/ml) were lipolytic. As IGF-II appeared more potent than IGF-I in promoting lipolysis, this effect may be mediated via the type 2 IGF receptor. The lipolytic effect of GH may be partly due to the actions of IGFs released locally.\r"

To determine if a binding protein for 1,25-(OH)2D3 is present in this tissue, rat liver was homogenized in a low ionic strength buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 2.2 m sucrose, 3 mM calcium chloride, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.04% Trasylol (sucrose buffer) and centrifuged over a 10-ml cushion of sucrose buffer at 61,000 x g for 80 min at 4 C. The resultant nuclear pellet was extracted in a 26 mM Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.3 M potassium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM sodium molybdate. Saturable 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding was identified in high salt extracts of rat liver nuclei and was eliminated by treatment with trypsin. This liver binding protein cosediments on high salt 5-20% sucrose density gradients with the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein from intestine and is distinct from the 6.OS tissue binding protein for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Perfusion of rat liver with PBS to remove receptor-positive blood cells before isolation of the nuclei did not change 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding. The nuclear protein bound 1,25-(OH)2D3 more avidly than either 24,25-(OH)2 D3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Saturation analysis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding revealed an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 20.6 +/- 2.2 pM (mean +/- SEM) at 4 C and a maximum binding capacity of 49.0 +/- 14.6 fmol/extract from 1.0 mg DNA. The 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding binding protein was present in liver nuclei isolated from mice, rabbits, and chicks and in nuclei isolated from cultured rat hepatocytes. The ligand specificity, sedimentation coefficient, limited binding capacity, trypsin sensitivity, and nuclear location of the hepatic 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding protein are similar to those of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors described in other tissues and suggest that the liver may be a target organ for [1,25-(OH)2D3] action.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of castration with or without testosterone propionate (TP) administration (one daily injection of 1 mg for 10 days) on the fat cell lipolytic activity in male hamsters. Basal and maximal lipolytic responses to the pure beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the mixed alpha 2-and beta-adrenergic agonist epinephrine, and the nonadrenergic compounds ACTH and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were all reduced by half in castrated animals. TP treatment restored these defective responses to control values, except the response to epinephrine which remained paradoxically unchanged. Sensitivity of lipolysis to epinephrine was unimpaired by castration but markedly reduced (10-fold) in TP-treated castrated hamsters. The antilipolytic potencies of the alpha 2-component of epinephrine and of the two alpha 2-agonists, UK 14304 and clonidine, were reduced by half in castrated animals, and returned to a value slightly higher than control after TP treatment. These changes in lipolysis were accompanied by parallel alterations in the stimulated cAMP responses to isoproterenol and forskolin but not to epinephrine. The latter was either unimpaired by castration or was clearly inhibited after TP treatment. Castration also induced a 2-fold decrease in the inhibitory potency of clonidine toward forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Finally, these changes in the potency of clonidine were accompanied by parallel variations of the number of fat cell alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. These results indicate that testosterone in vivo, while increasing the beta-adrenergic lipolytic action of catecholamines (possibly through enhancement of the adenylate cyclase activity), promotes, to a greater extent, their alpha 2-adrenoreceptor-mediated antilipolytic potency. By providing the first demonstration that the androgenic status controls the functional alpha 2/beta-adrenergic balance in fat cells, this study also emphasizes the potential importance of such a control in the mechanisms underlying the sex-related differences in adipose tissue regional distribution and fat cell size.\r"

  ".U": "88224859\r", 
  ".W": "After incubation with [125]T3, the amount of radioactivity associated with the nuclear receptor and extranuclear compartment increases in glial C6 cells previously exposed to millimolar concentrations of butyrate. These actions of the fatty acid are accompanied by an inhibition of cell division, as shown by the decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation or total DNA content per culture. Isobutyrate produced a similar effect at concentrations higher than 2 mM, whereas between 0.5-2 mM it increased the receptor content without affecting either extra-nuclear hormone or DNA. For both fatty acids there was a close parallelism between the dose-response curve for the inhibition of turnover of [3H]acetate from the histones and the increase in receptor levels. In contrast, a different dose dependence was found for the increase in extranuclear T3 levels, which suggests that the latter is caused by a mechanism other than histone acetylation. The increase in extranuclear T3 levels correlated better with the decrease in DNA and the accumulation of the chromosomal protein H10, which is thought to be related to the inhibition of cell proliferation. This suggests a relationship between the increase in extranuclear T3 and the inhibition of DNA synthesis. However, other agents, such as glucocorticoids or cAMP, which also inhibit C6 cell proliferation, were ineffective in increasing not only the receptor but also the extranuclear hormone. These findings show that the effect of short chain fatty acids on the receptor is not a consequence of the inhibition of cell replication, and that this inhibition could be related to, but is not sufficient per se for causing the increase in extranuclear T3.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine whether diurnal rhythms in serotonin (5HT) activity are detectable in individual hypothalamic nuclei of ovariectomized rats and whether estradiol induces specific rhythms of 5HT which may be necessary to cyclic release of LH and/or PRL. Young (3- to 4-month old) rats were bilaterally ovariectomized and 7 days later half the animals received Silastic estradiol capsules. Two days later groups were again divided: half the animals in each group were killed at 0800, 1200, 1800, and 2400 h. The remaining animals received pargyline (75 mg/kg body weight, ip) at these times and were killed 10 min later. The median eminence (ME), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), medial preoptic area (MPN), arcuate nucleus (AN), and globus pallidus (GP) were microdissected and assayed for 5HT by HPLC using electrochemical detection. A diurnal rhythm in 5HT turnover was found in the SCN, MPN, and AN of ovariectomized rats. 5HT turnover in these areas was significantly higher during the light hours (0800, 1200, and 1800 h) compared to the dark phase (2400 h). The ME and GP of ovariectomized rats did not exhibit a diurnal rhythm in 5HT activity. Exposure to estrogen altered the pattern of 5HT activity in all hypothalamic areas examined. In the ME, treatment with estradiol increased 5HT turnover at 1200 h, just before the predicted LH and PRL surge, and suppressed activity at all other times. In the SCN, estradiol reversed the 5HT rhythm: turnover was low during the light hours and high during the dark. In the AN and MPN, estradiol treatment increased 5HT activity and abolished the diurnal rhythm. 5HT activity in the GP was not altered by exposure to estrogen. We conclude from these data that specific brain nuclei exhibit diurnal rhythms in 5HT turnover and that the patterns of 5HT activity in specific hypothalamic nuclei exhibit individual and unique responses to the presence of estrogen. These data suggest that the estradiol-induced diurnal pattern of 5HT activity may be necessary for the induction of cyclic release of LH and/or PRL.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether 1) a diurnal rhythm in serotonin turnover is present in specific hypothalamic nuclei of middle-aged ovariectomized rats and 2) in middle-aged animals exposure to estrogen can induce the pattern of serotonin dynamics which appears necessary for the occurrence of an LH surge in young rats. Young (3-4 month old) and middle-aged (8-10 month old) rats which demonstrated estrous cyclicity were bilaterally ovariectomized. Seven days later half of the young and middle-aged animals received Silastic estradiol capsules. On day 9 post ovariectomy the groups were again divided; half of the rats in each group were killed at 0800, 1200, 1800, and 2400 h. Remaining animals were treated with pargyline (75 mg/kg BW, ip) at these times and were killed 10 min later, and the following brain areas were microdissected and analyzed for serotonin (5HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid: median eminence (ME), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), arcuate nucleus (AN), and globus pallidus. In young ovariectomized rats the SCN, MPN, and AN exhibited a diurnal rhythm in 5HT activity which was high during the light hours and low during the dark. The diurnal rhythm could not be detected in any hypothalamic nuclei of ovariectomized middle-aged animals. The loss in the circadian component of 5HT activity is not due to a loss in serotonergic function, since overall turnover rates were not reduced compared to young animals. Estrogen treatment modified the diurnal pattern of 5HT activity in the SCN, MPN, and AN in young rats but had no effect in the middle-aged rats. In young rats, estrogen induced a transitory rise in ME-5HT turnover at 1200 h, just before the expected onset of the LH surge. In middle-aged animals the increase in ME-5HT turnover did not occur until 1800 h and correlates with a delay in the initiation of the estradiol-induced LH surge. We conclude that: 1) there is a loss in the rhythm of 5HT activity in middle-aged rats and 2) the diurnal rhythmicity of 5HT turnover may be necessary for the maintenance of normal cyclic release of LH.\r"

  ".W": "In seasonally breeding species, an animal's photoperiodic history (the daylength or photoperiod previously experienced) influences the reproductive response to new photoperiods. However, this has only been examined over a relatively narrow range of photoperiods. We assessed whether Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) respond to daylength changes at extremely long and extremely short photoperiods. To determine the extent and temporal sequence of reproductive responses to photoperiod changes, ultrasonography was employed to determine serial changes in testis weight in individual animals; serial changes in body weight and pelage color were also assessed. Male animals (60-day-old) shifted from 6 h of light/day (6L) to 10L showed partial testicular recrudescence and darkening of the coat. In control animals remaining in 6L, testes remained small, and coat color continued to lighten. Animals shifted from 20L to 16L showed partial and transient testicular regression, whereas testes remained large in control animals remaining in 20L. There were no significant differences in body weight between control and experimental animals in either study. These findings indicate that Djungarian hamsters respond reproductively to changes in photoperiod at extreme daylengths, but the magnitude of the response appears to be dependent on the absolute daylength.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies with iv infusions of GH or its releasing factor (GRF), we showed that a pulsatile pattern of GH was more effective than continuous GH exposure in stimulating growth in the rat. Since GH release is profoundly affected by its inhibitory factor, somatostatin (SS), we were interested to know whether the effects of SS on GH secretion and growth were also dependent on its pattern of administration. SS infusions were given iv to conscious chronically cannulated female rats through programmable multichannel infusion pumps. Multiple blood samples were obtained with the use of an automated system of pumps, solenoid fluid valves, and a fraction collector, all controlled by a microcomputer. SS infusions (5, 25, or 50 micrograms/h) suppressed GH secretion and elicited a rapid, short-lived rebound release of GH after stopping the infusion. Sinusoidal SS infusions in female rats produced cyclic episodes of GH secretion, but a male type of regular 3-hourly secretory pulses of GH was best achieved by prolonged infusions in which the delivery of SS was interrupted for a short period every 3 h. This intermittent SS infusion pattern elicited a repetitive series of rebound bursts of GH secretion, which increased body weight gain and pituitary GH content. In contrast, continuous infusions of equivalent amounts of SS had no effect on body weight gain and reduced bone growth significantly. Thus the effects of SS on growth do depend on the pattern in which it is administered, and this peptide, which itself powerfully inhibits GH secretion, paradoxically stimulates weight gain in a normal animal when given in a manner that promotes a more pulsatile GH secretory pattern.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of two ovarian steroid treatments that induce proestrous-like surges in LH secretion on responsiveness to morphine sulfate (MS), as measured by induced hypothermic, antinociceptive, behavioral, and LH secretory changes. Ovariectomized rats received no steroids (OVX), 7.5 micrograms estradiol benzoate 2 days before the experiment (EB), or EB and then 5 mg progesterone 48 h later (EBP). MS administration coincided with the steroid-induced LH hypersecretion that occurs in the EB and EBP rats at 1530-1630 h. Serum LH concentrations were determined 30 min after administration of MS. In OVX and EB rats, MS caused a dose-dependent decrease in serum LH, but even 20 mg/kg MS did not alter serum LH during the EBP-induced LH surge. Brain-mediated morphine-induced analgesia was evaluated in the three steroid treatment groups from measurement of latency to pawlick on a hot plate. EB and EBP rats were less responsive than OVX rats to MS-induced antinociception. EB and EBP rats were also less responsive than OVX animals to the spinal cord-mediated analgesia due to MS, as calculated by tail-flick latency. MS-induced hypothermia revealed a responsiveness order of OVX greater than EB greater than EBP. Whereas MS caused a dose-dependent reduction in locomotor activity in OVX and EB rats, EBP rats showed marked hyperactivity at low MS doses and were less responsive to the suppression of locomotor activity at higher doses. These marked steroid-induced changes in MS responsiveness could not be explained by altered pharmacokinetic disposition of morphine. These data indicate that treatment with EBP, which stimulates a preovulatory-like LH surge, decreases the ability of MS to induce hypothermic, antinociceptive, and behavioral responses and abolishes its capacity to suppress LH release. These effects of gonadal steroids were not observed before the LH surge, which suggests that this surge is linked to the decline in MS sensitivity. Further, the diminished response to MS appears to be a function of the magnitude of the LH surge.\r"

  ".W": "The sex and age-related changes in the concentration of cytosol progesterone receptors (CPR) induced by estrogen (E) treatment in rat brain and pituitary were investigated by a modification of the Palkovits punch procedure using fresh tissue. Young male and female gonadectomized rats, 15, 21, 30, and 42 days of age, were treated for 44 h by a single sc injection of synthetic E. [Moxestrol (Ru2858)]. Adult gonadectomized animals were treated for 72 h by three injections of estradiol benzoate. Cytosol from pituitary and from punches of ventromedial nuclei (VMN), medial preoptic area (mPOA), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and cerebral cortex was labeled with 0.4 nM [3H]promegestrone (Ru5020) to maximize signal to noise and specificity of labeling of CPR. The developmental patterns of CPR differed across brain regions and between males and females. In VMN, females showed higher CPR levels after estrogen priming at 15, 21, and 42 days of age and in the adult; in ARC, females showed higher CPR levels after E priming at 15, 21, and 30 days of age, but not at 42 days or in the adult. In mPOA and pituitary, no consistent sex differences in CPR induction were found. Cortex showed no induction of CPR by E priming. Radioautography of [3H]Ru5020 uptake in VMN of E-primed 15-day-old male and female rats revealed significantly higher labeling in females, thus showing that the CPR levels in vitro reflect a difference in hormone retention in vivo. Female VMN contained more neurons with a higher labeling index than male VMN. Before puberty (approximately = 30 days), there was a decline in CPR levels induced by E priming in both sexes in pituitary, ARC, mPOA, and VMN. At 30 days, the female greater than male sex difference disappeared and tended to reverse in mPOA and VMN, only to be restored again by 42 days of age. Thus, the CPR induction by E priming may reflect underlying changes in E-sensitive brain regions associated with the preparation for puberty, as well as underlying sex differences in response to estrogen programmed by perinatal exposure to testosterone.\r"

This study characterized pharmacologically those voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in normal rat anterior pituitary cells that are involved in the elevation of [Ca2+]i upon high potassium-induced membrane depolarization. The [Ca2+]i was monitored directly by means of the intracellularly trapped fluorescent indicator fura-2. The addition of K+ (6-100 mM) increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. The fluorescent signal reached a peak within seconds and then decayed to form a new elevated plateau. K+ at the highest concentration used (100 mM) raised [Ca2+]i by about 450 nM. The K+-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was absent in a Ca2+-free medium. BAY K 8644, a 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonist, also caused an increase in [Ca2+]i. The maximum response in [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with BAY K 8644 (100 nM) was about 40 nM. The half-maximally effective concentration of BAY K 8644 (100 nM) was about 20 nM. The response in [Ca2+]i upon BAY K 8644-stimulation was abolished in a Ca2+-free medium. Predepolarization with various K+ concentrations enhanced the effect of BAY K 8644 (1 microM) on [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment with BAY K 8644 (1 microM) enhanced the response in [Ca2+]i induced by K+ (25 mM). The addition of Mg2+ (30 mM) and nifedipine (1 microM) lowered the resting [Ca2+]i by about 40 and 20 nM, respectively. Mg2+, nifedipine, nimodipine, Go 5438, verapamil, and diltiazem inhibited the K+ (25 mM)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i; the order of potency (and half-maximally inhibitory concentrations) were nimodipine = Go 5438 = nifedipine (approximately 100 nM) greater than verapamil (900 nM) greater than diltiazem (greater than 10 microM) greater than Mg2+ (6 mM). Omega-Conotoxin (100 nM) did not inhibit the K+ (25 mM)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. These data demonstrate that, over a wide range, membrane depolarization induced by high potassium concentration is indeed associated with increases in [Ca2+]i in normal rat anterior pituitary cells. This elevation of [Ca2+]i is mainly due to an influx of Ca2+ through 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive, omega-conotoxin-insensitive calcium channels (L-type).\r"

  ".U": "88224880\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory provided evidence for the existence of a specific placental lactogen (PL) receptor in tissues of fetal lambs and pregnant sheep. The PL receptor is structurally and functionally distinct from somatotropic (GH) and lactogenic (PRL) receptors, and there are conspicuous differences in the expression of the three receptors during ontogeny. The results of the present study indicate striking differences in the solubilization of PL- and GH-binding sites in maternal and fetal sheep liver. Radiolabeled ovine PL (oPL) bound specifically and with high affinity (Kd, 0.97 nM) to soluble detergent extracts of ovine fetal liver, but there was no specific binding of radiolabeled ovine GH (oGH) or oPRL to soluble extracts or insoluble fractions of fetal liver. When liver microsomes of pregnant sheep were extracted with Triton X-100, 80% of the [125I]oPL-binding sites were recovered in the soluble fraction, but 76% of the [125I]oGH binding sites were recovered in the insoluble pellet. Soluble extracts of maternal liver had high affinity for oPL (Kd, 1.45 nM), but low affinity for oGH (Kd 33 nM) and oPRL (Kd, 1-2 microM). On the other hand, Triton-insoluble fractions of maternal liver had high affinity for oGH (Kd, 0.95 nM) as well as oPL (Kd, 0.91 nM), but low affinity for oPRL (Kd, 1-2 microM). The subunit structure of the [125I]oPL-binding site in soluble fractions of fetal and maternal liver (mol wt, 38-47K) was distinct from that of the [125I]oGH-binding site in Triton-insoluble fractions of maternal liver (mol wt, 54/118K). These findings indicate that treatment of microsomal fractions of fetal and maternal sheep liver with Triton X-100 solubilizes the oPL receptor but not the oGH receptor. The differential solubilization of PL- and GH-binding sites may facilitate purification of the two distinct receptors and clarification of their respective roles in the regulation of fetal and postnatal growth.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of bilateral nephrectomy or a sham operation on plasma angiotensinogen and on the different kininogens were studied in the rat. Total plasma kininogen was measured by RIA of kinins after trypsin hydrolysis. In addition, the high molecular weight (HMW) kininogen and the low molecular weight (T)-kininogen were specifically quantified by using direct RIAs. Angiotensinogen was measured by RIA of angiotensin I after exhaustion by renin. Three groups of control, nonoperated, bilaterally nephrectomized and sham-operated rats were studied in each experiment. Twenty-four hours after either a bilateral nephrectomy or a sham operation total plasma kininogen was elevated approximately 5 times when compared to control rats. Time course measurements from 0 to 48 h in 3 other groups of control, bilaterally nephrectomized and sham-operated rats demonstrated that kininogen gradually increased at 12, 24, and 48 h after the surgery and that the elevation observed in plasma kininogen appeared to be entirely due to an increase in T-kininogen levels. There was no difference in T-kininogen levels between bilaterally nephrectomized and sham-operated animals. By contrast HMW kininogen was neither influenced by surgery nor by nephrectomy. Angiotensinogen increased more than 8 times in bilaterally nephrectomized rats but displayed only little changes in sham-operated animals. During the course of this experiment it was observed that also in control animals submitted to repeated skin incision and venipuncture for blood sampling at the jugular vein, T-kininogen increased dramatically in plasma, but reached values lower than in sham-operated or bilaterally nephrectomized rats. In a third experiment performed in normal rats it was found that T-kininogen levels were more than 3 times elevated over initial values 24 h after a single blood sampling at the jugular vein. These results indicate that T-kininogen but not HMW kininogen is very sensitive to surgery, perhaps as a result of increased T-kininogen synthesis due to an inflammatory reaction. The T-kininogen might participate in the inflammatory reaction that occurs at the site of tissue injury and in the healing process. As there was no difference in T-kininogen, and in HMW kininogen levels between bilaterally nephrectomized and sham-operated rats, the kidneys do not seem to play an important role in the regulation of plasma kininogens. Angiotensinogen, HMW kininogen, and T-kininogen are therefore regulated separately after nephrectomy or surgery.\r"

This domain of chick progesterone receptor (PR) and other receptors was immunochemically characterized using site-directed antibodies. Eight peptides were synthesized corresponding to portion of the conserved cysteine region from PR, glucocorticoid, or estrogen receptor proteins. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with peptide conjugated to a protein carrier. The cross-reactivity of each antiserum was tested by Western blotting against chick and human PR, human glucocorticoid receptor, and human estrogen receptor. Of the several antisera positive by Western blots, only one cross-reacted with native chick PR. It was found that antibody bound to 4S transformed receptor, but not to 8S nontransformed receptor. At 50 mM KCl, antibody bound preferentially to transformed receptor form A, but at 400 mM KCl antibody bound equally well to either receptor form A or B. Binding of PR to DNA-cellulose was partially inhibited by the presence of cross-reacting peptide antibody. Thus, we have obtained at least one site-directed antibody against steroid receptors which is a useful structural probe to the DNA-binding functional domain of these gene regulatory proteins.\r"

Two of 28 positive wells were selected for cloning and characterization: D2 and 4G11. Their antiidiotypic character was evidenced by TSH-inhibitable binding to affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TSH. The specificity of D2 and 4G11 for the hormone-binding region of the TSH receptor was demonstrated by several findings: 1) they inhibited the binding of [125I]iodo-bTSH to receptor in a dose-dependent manner; 2) their binding to partially purified thyroid plasma membranes could be completely inhibited by bTSH and hTSH; and 3) they inhibited the TSH-dependent growth and adenylate cyclase stimulation in FRTL-5 cells in a dose-dependent manner. By Western blot analysis of bovine thyroid membranes, D2 bound to a polypeptide of 188,000-195,000 mol wt under nonreducing conditions and 54,000-59,000 mol wt after treatment of membranes with beta-mercaptoethanol; the 4G11 epitope was undetectable. Scatchard analysis of the binding of 125I-labeled antibodies to receptor showed that 4G11 bound to a single site with a Kd of 5.7 X 10(-9) M, whereas D2 showed complex binding characterized by high affinity (Kd = 1.74 X 10(-11) M) and low affinity (Kd = 1.3 X 10(-8) M) sites. Binding studies in which D2 and 4G11 competed with each other for the TSH receptor showed mutual but unequal inhibition. The data suggest that portions of the D2 and 4G11 epitopes overlap, but that there is a high affinity binding site(s) for D2 for which 4G11 competes less effectively. The binding of D2 and 4G11 to TSH receptor was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies secreted by Graves' heterohybridomas, showing that D2 and 4G11 share characteristics with autoantibodies of Graves' disease and lending support to the hypothesis that idiotypic network interactions may play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease.\r"

Epinephrine, which was not obtained in any of the five intact males, was detectable in three of five castrated male rats. Norepinephrine rose from nondetectable to high levels after castration in all animals. In contrast to dopamine, which was significantly decreased in castrated males, levels of 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid were significantly increased in castrated vs. intact male rats. Homovanillic acid was rarely detected in either intact or castrated males. These results demonstrate that the push-pull perfusion technique can be used to measure neurotransmitter levels in the anterior pituitary lobes of living rats. More importantly, after castration a distinct rise in norepinephrine and epinephrine accompanied by a decrease in dopamine was clearly detected, suggesting that these neurotransmitters may play an important role directly at the pituitary.\r"

  ".W": "Diethylstilbestrol (DES) feminizes chick embryos in ovo, preventing regression of the Mullerian ducts (MDs). The feminized testis, however, despite its ovarian-like appearance, continues to produce Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS). This study was designed to test whether exogenous DES preserved the MD against endogenous MIS by affecting the target organ (feminization). DES (0.1 mg) was injected into the air sacs of 5-day-old chick embryos. Testes were obtained from 15-day-old chick embryos and MDs from 8-day-old chick embryos and combined in organ culture for 72 h. MD regression was examined macroscopically and microscopically after 3 days in vitro in medium without DES (group A: n = 155) and with 10(-6) M DES (group B: n = 169). Four types of coculture were set up as follows: 1) Control testis with control MD; 2) DES-treated testis with DES-treated MD; 3) Control testis with DES-treated MD; 4) DES-treated testis with control MD. In medium without DES (group A), MD regression was inhibited significantly when the duct was pretreated with DES [2) and 3) vs. 1) and 4)]. The pretreated testis produced slightly less regression [4) vs. 1)], but this was not significant. Previous studies in ovo had suggested that estrogen prevented MD regression directly as well as causing feminization of the testis, because MIS secretion was not inhibited from the feminized gonad. These results show that pretreatment of the MD with DES blocks regression in vitro by a normal testis, confirming that the primary site of action of estrogen is on the duct itself.\r"

A 16K fragment derived from cleaved PRL (cPRL) has mammary mitogenic activity in rats in vivo, and we found that both cleaved and 16K PRLs are capable of binding to hepatic PRL receptors. To analyze the functional significance of cleaved and 16K PRLs, ample amounts of cPRL were generated by incubation of 24K rPRL in vitro with a 25,000 X g rat mammary gland pellet. cPRL was reduced (2-mercaptoethanol), and the 16K and 8K fragments were separated by gel filtration. The purity of the cleaved and 16K samples was established by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their mitogenic [pigeon crop-sac, Nb2 lymphoma cell, and mammary cell bioassays (BAs)], lactogenic (casein BA), and immunologic (PRL RIA) activities were determined. cPRL had the same mitogenic activity, but half the immunoactivity, as intact PRL. The 16K fragment was biologically active in all assays. Its estimated mitogenic and lactogenic potencies were 65% and 10% those of the 24K PRL, respectively, and it had only 2% the immunoactivity of the intact hormone. Thus, the 16K fragment had higher BA to RIA ratios than cleaved or intact 24K PRLs. The functional significance of 16K PRL may have been underestimated owing to its low RIA activity.\r"

  ".W": "In intact growing rats, intermittent administration of low doses of PTH increases bone mass. As gonadal hormones are considered to be essential for normal bone growth, the anabolic effect of PTH may be mediated or modified by these hormones. The objective of this research was to determine if the anabolic effect of PTH would be altered in female ovariectomized (OVX) and male orchidectomized (ORCHX) rats. Two weeks after ovariectomy, orchidectomy, or sham operations, 5-week-old rats (eight per group) were given daily sc injections of human PTH (1-34) (8 micrograms/100 g) or vehicle. After 12 days of treatment, all rats were killed; castration was confirmed, and sera, femurs, tibias, and kidneys were collected. Calcium (Ca) and dry weight (DW) of trabecular and cortical bone of distal half-femurs were measured. Female OVX rats were osteopenic compared to their sham-operated controls, as the bone mass of distal femurs decreased while body weight increased. In PTH-treated females, total bone Ca and DW per 100 g BW increased significantly by 16% and 21%, respectively, in sham-operated rats and by 21% and 25%, respectively, in OVX rats compared to the appropriate control values. ORCHX rats were also osteopenic, as the bone mass of distal femurs was significantly decreased compared to that in sham-operated males. However, as body weight also decreased, the bone mass per unit BW was not altered. In PTH-treated males, total bone Ca and DW per 100 g BW increased significantly by 34% and 25%, respectively, in sham-operated rats by 32% and 29%, respectively, in ORCHX rats compared to their appropriate control values. Serum Ca, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase levels were normal and comparable in all rats. We conclude that PTH increased bone mass in control, OVX, and ORCHX rats, and the anabolic response to PTH is not dependent on gonadal hormones.\r"

Three or four anterior pituitaries from 21-day-old rat pups were implanted under the renal capsule in 175- to 200-g adult rats. The donor and recipient animals were sex matched. One week after implantation, animals were thyroidectomized or sham operated. A separate group of animals received daily T4 treatment (1.5 g/100 g, ip). After 2 weeks, the native and heterotopic pituitaries were assayed for SP, TSH, PRL, and LH. Thyroidectomy resulted in a 3- to 10-fold increase in the SP concentration in both the heterotopic and native pituitaries compared to euthyroid values. T4 treatment suppressed the SP levels in the heterotopic pituitaries of the thyroidectomized rats. In contrast to the reduction of TSH concentrations in native pituitaries in thyroidectomized animals vs. controls, TSH concentrations in the heterotopic pituitaries of thyroidectomized rats were approximately 10 times greater than those in euthyroid animals. PRL concentrations were unaffected by hypothyroidism in native and heterotopic pituitaries. Thyroidectomy resulted in a decrease in LH concentrations in the native anterior pituitary, without affecting LH concentrations in the implanted pituitary. These findings indicate that a direct link from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary is not required for the pituitary SP response to hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "Two forms of human GH (hGH) have been produced by recombinant DNA technology. One form has an amino acid sequence identical to that of the natural pituitary hormone (rhGH) and the other form has an additional N-terminal methionine (Met-hGH). The biological potencies of these 2 polypeptides have been compared in hypophysectomized rats in a multidose study measuring body weights and several long bone growth parameters. The pharmacokinetic profiles after iv and sc injection were determined in cynomolgus monkeys in a 4-period cross-over study. All of the measured parameters in all the studies indicated that there was no difference in the two forms of hGH. Measurements taken after 27 daily injections of rhGH or Met-hGH (30-500 micrograms/kg.day) indicated that femur length and width of the proliferative zone in the tibial epiphysis showed dose-related effects for both forms of hGH but no difference between them. The relative potency, based on body weight gain, was calculated using a parallel line bioassay. Weight gain after 8 daily injections in the 5-dose long bone growth study indicated a rhGH potency of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.23) relative to Met-hGH. It was concluded that the presence of an N-terminal methionine on hGH has no effect on potency in this model. The pharmacokinetic parameters after iv administration were estimated by fitting serum concentration-time data to a 2-compartment model. Parameters after sc injection were computed by compartment-independent methods. Met-hGH and rhGH had very similar pharmacokinetic profiles after both routes of administration. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that the clearance after iv administration (rhGH, 15 ml/min; Met-hGH, 13 ml/min) and the sc bioavailability (rhGH, 0.72 +/- 0.21; Met-hGH, 0.59 +/- 0.21) were not significantly different for the 2 forms of hGH. It was concluded that rhGH and Met-hGH have equivalent bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin A toxicity has been associated with alterations in mineral metabolism and may result in osteopenia, fractures, deformities, and growth arrest. The pathogenesis of the bone lesions that occur in vitamin A toxicity is, however, ill defined and was examined in the present study. The administration of pharmacological doses of vitamin A to growing male rats resulted in weakness and spontaneous fractures. Undecalcified bone histology of vitamin A toxic animals was characterized by increased bone resorption, osteoclastosis, a paucity of trabecular surfaces covered with osteoid, and lesions which appear to be pathognomonic of hypervitaminosis A. The serum calcium and magnesium levels of vitamin A-toxic animals were unremarkable, but serum phosphate levels were significantly higher than control values. Urinary hydroxyproline excretion reflected bone histology and was significantly increased in experimental rats. Circulating levels of the potent bone resorbers, PTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, were, however, comparable in vitamin A-toxic and control animals, suggesting a possible direct effect of vitamin A on bone. Subsequently, the effects of vitamin A (retinol) on in vitro collagen synthesis (incorporation of [3H]proline into collagen) and bone resorption (45Ca release from bone) were examined using a fetal rat calvarial culture. Retinol added to the culture medium for 20-24 h in concentrations ranging from 0.5-10 micrograms/ml selectively inhibited collagen synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion. Higher concentrations of retinol were toxic and resulted in a general inhibition of protein synthesis. Bone resorption was stimulated by 0.5 and 2.5 micrograms/ml retinol. We conclude that vitamin A toxicity in rats causes bone lesions, the genesis of which can be explained, at least in part, by a direct effect of the vitamin on skeletal tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has biochemically identified lysosomes containing calcium and calbindin-D28K (CaBP) in chick intestine that are sensitive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] status. In the present work, lysosomal accumulation of 45Ca was optimal after 30 min of absorption from in situ ligated duodenal loops. The areas under the curves, defined as lysosomal fractions in Percoll gradients, were calculated, and values after 10, 20, 30, and 40 min of transport were (+D/-D ratio) 0.90, 1.62, 1.88, and 1.78, respectively. Lysosomal CaBP also increased in parallel with the time of absorption and was not due to nonspecific adsorption. When lysosomal 45Ca was determined 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 43 h after administration of 1.3 nmol 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle, the area ratios were 1.02, 1.47, 3.10, 1.88, and 1.29, respectively. Analyses of serum 45Ca in the same birds yielded a closely parallel time course with 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent intestinal calcium absorption; values were 108 +/- 12% (+/- SE), 164 +/- 29%, 300 +/- 35%, 340 +/- 39%, and 169 +/- 8% of vitamin D-deficient control values at 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 43 h, respectively. Immunoreactive CaBP in lysosomal fractions did not change significantly between 5-43 h after administration of seco-steroid. A similar series of experiments was conducted with microsomal membranes containing putative endocytic vesicles, which are believed to deliver calcium to the lysosomes. The brush border origin of the vesicles was supported by the internalization of anti-CaBP immunoglobulin G after 3 min of absorption. Accumulation of 45Ca by endocytic vesicles was subsequently found to be maximal after 20 min of absorption (+D/-D = 1.48), declining again at 30 min (+D/-D = 1.16), while CaBP levels in the same fractions remained unchanged between 0-30 min of absorption. These data together with the lower 45Ca specific activity in pinocytic vesicles relative to lysosomes suggest that lysosomes fuse with several endocytic vesicles in the interval of 20-30 min of absorption. Time-course studies with endocytic vesicles indicated that 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated uptake more rapidly than transport; 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 43 h after seco-steroid administration, +D/-D ratios were 1.32, 1.87, 2.05, 1.72, and 1.36, respectively. CaBP levels in the same vesicle fractions did not correlate well with relative 45Ca content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In view of the presence of distinct oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) receptors in the male genital tract (porcine) we have reexamined the receptors for OT and AVP in the classical OT target tissue, female genital tract (rabbit). Neurohypophysial hormone receptors have been investigated in vagina, myometrium, and oviduct using quantitative ligand binding, adenylate cyclase, and contractility studies. Our results clearly indicate the presence of distinct OT and V1 VP receptors in the myometrium, while only the latter was detected in vagina and oviduct. In myometrium, estrogen treatment increases the density of OT and AVP receptors, while progesterone administration inhibits the estrogen effect. At the time of spontaneous delivery a dramatic (17-fold) increase was observed for the OT sites, while the AVP sites were unchanged. AVP receptors in vagina were sensitive to sex steroid administration and were reduced during pregnancy and delivery. Isometric contractility studies suggest that not just OT, but AVP can stimulate uterine strips, an effect that is partially reversible by the V1 antagonist d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP. In vagina only AVP is effective in inducing contractions at nanomolar concentrations. These results suggest a role for AVP as well as OT in regulation of the motility of female genital tract.\r"

Therefore to partly resolve the question of whether the IGF 1 was of circulating or local origin in relation to its effect on antler growth, we surgically prevented stags from growing antlers. We recorded significantly elevated plasma levels of IGF 1 in the non-antlered stags compared with normal antlered stags during the antler growth periods. This result is consistent with a hypothesis that the antler is a target organ for IGF 1 and that prevention of antler growth removed a population of IGF 1 receptors. IGF 1 is already known to stimulate body growth but this work points strongly to the possibility that plasma IGF 1 may stimulate individual organ growth in an endocrine manner.\r"

However, some authors have reported the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a few adult patients and in some children who have seizures after a long period without problems. The aims of this study were (a) to search for early predictors of outcome and (b) to ascertain the long-term prognosis of BECT in a large group of patients. An attempt to relocate 268 patients born between 1941 and 1967 and consecutively seen as outpatients was undertaken. The outcome after age 20 is known for only 168. Being adults and cured, the others are no longer in touch with their clinics or have moved. Only one indicator of short-term prognosis was found: The earlier the onset of BECT, the longer the period with seizures. Of the 168 patients, 165 are seizure-free with follow-up ranging from 7 to 30 years. Three patients experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures at age 18, 22-24, and 35. Two apparently had an isolated seizure. The occurrence of such seizures after recovery from BECT is a rare event (approximately 2% of cases) and a relapse with partial seizures is quite uncommon. These patients do not differ from patients remaining seizure-free.\r"

Each patient started with monotherapy at standard daily doses. Data were collected at admission, at scheduled 6-month exams, and at unscheduled exams and included age, sex, general profile of the disease, and treatment. Prognosis of epilepsy was evaluated by actuarial methods using first seizure relapse after onset of treatment to indicate unfavorable prognosis. In addition, a maximum interval of complete seizure control was calculated and related to length of follow-up in order to grade the severity of the disease (defined as mild, moderate, or severe). The average length of follow-up was 21.6 months (range 2-40). Seizure relapse occurred in 52% of cases during follow-up (36% by 3 months, 43% by 6 months, and 49% by 12 months). A larger number of seizures before therapy and the presence of combined seizure patterns were the variables most commonly associated with relapse. In general, epilepsy was mild in 65% of the cases, moderate in 28%, and severe in 7%. The earlier the first relapse the higher the risk of developing more severe disease. A larger number of seizures before treatment, combined seizure types, earlier age at onset, and prolonged disease duration (1 month to 1 year) seemed to be more frequently associated with the development of moderate-to-severe epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "In a survey of 446 children with epilepsy attending a regional EEG unit, mothers of nearly 90% of the children reported factors that appeared to act as precipitants of their children's seizures. The relationship between these factors and the seizures ranged from consistent triggers to an occasional association. There were no differences in incidence according to sex, site of focus, or type of epilepsy. Associations between environmental events or internal states are so commonly perceived by mothers that routine inquiry would appear warranted. If the event can be corroborated as a seizure precipitant, application of psychological methods of seizure control may be appropriate; if the event cannot be corroborated, needless anxiety about particular situations for a child may be avoided.\r"

  ".U": "88224968\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-one infants with neonatal seizures frequent enough to be captured by randomly recorded routine EEG examinations were studied to determine how often their electrographic seizures were occult (subclinical) and to examine the effects of seizure duration and mental status on their clinical visibility. Seizures were the result of diverse etiologies and most infants had received one or more antiepileptic drug prior to the EEG recordings. The majority of electrographic seizures were occult: only 84 of 393 (21%) were accompanied by distinctive clinical seizure activity; the remaining 79% were occult. There was no significant difference between the duration of EEG seizures with distinctive clinical signs and those without. There was no significant difference in the proportion of occult seizures in neonates with preserved consciousness compared with lethargic or comatose infants. We conclude that unaided visual inspection of infants seriously underestimates true seizure frequency. Long-term EEG monitoring may be necessary in many infants to determine their real seizure frequency and to judge the adequacy of antiepileptic drug treatment.\r"

When the infantile spasms patients were subdivided according to the presence or absence of etiologic associations, highly elevated amino acid levels were observed only in CSF from patients of the symptomatic subgroup. The idiopathic subgroup showed levels of free amino acids that were not statistically different from those of the nonneurologic control group. These results indicate that while abnormalities of amino acid metabolism often accompany infantile spasms, no specific pattern of the major free amino acids in CSF appears to be directly related to this seizure disorder. Elevated levels of the excitatory amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, do not necessarily accompany infantile spasms, and in this study were only observed in symptomatic patients.\r"

This IgG2 decrease was maintained after 4 and 12 months of carbamazepine therapy. IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 concentrations did not change. IgG2 deficiency was not seen. The reduction in IgG2 was not related to the carbamazepine serum concentration within the therapeutic range, to the type of epilepsy, or to the age of the patient. The carbamazepine-induced reduction of IgG2 in serum may indicate an altered immune response to certain antigens, preferentially to carbohydrates.\r"

In the \"low Mg2+\" model, removal of Mg2+ from the perfusion fluid increased excitatory neurotransmission and led to epileptogenic field potentials. In the \"low Ca2+\" model, decrease of Ca2+ and increase of Mg2+ and K+ in the perfusion fluid induced spontaneous \"bursts\" in the absence of synaptic transmission. Paired-pulse stimulation was used to estimate the strength of recurrent inhibition in the \"inhibition\" model. The rank order of the potency of the compounds to antagonize the second epileptogenic population spike in the low Mg2+ model was 2-APH greater than pentobarbital greater than midazolam greater than phenytoin greater than carbamazepine greater than chlordiazepoxide greater than phenobarbital = flurazepam. Ethosuximide and valproate were inactive. In the low Ca2+ model, the rank order of the potency of the drugs to antagonize spontaneous epileptogenic bursts was phenytoin greater than carbamazepine greater than midazolam greater than pentobarbital greater than chlordiazepoxide greater than flurazepam greater than phenobarbital. 2-APH, ethosuximide, and valproate were inactive. Only pentobarbital was active in the inhibition model. These experiments demonstrate the potential of in vitro tests in the hippocampus to reveal profiles of anticonvulsant activity.\r"

  ".W": "ADD 17014[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) delta 2-1,2,3-triazoline], is a representative member of a hitherto unknown, structurally novel family of anticonvulsant agents. The anticonvulsant profile of ADD 17014 following intraperitoneal (i.p.) and oral administration in mice and rats was evaluated using a battery of well-standardized anticonvulsant tests and compared with phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), ethosuximide (ESM), and valproate (VPA). The results indicate that ADD 17014 is effective in nontoxic i.p. doses in mice by the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), Metrazol (subcutaneous, s.c. Met), bicuculline (s.c. Bic) and picrotoxin (s.c. Pic) tests, but ineffective against strychnine-induced seizures; it is also effective after nontoxic oral doses in both mice and rats by the MES and s.c. Met tests. Protective indices (PI = TD50/ED50), calculated from i.p. data in mice, were highest for ADD 17014 by the s.c. Met (26.02) and s.c. Bic (93.93) tests; the PIs, after oral administration in mice and rats, were equal to or higher than those of the prototype agents. In vitro receptor binding studies of ADD 17014 and potential metabolites indicated no significant inhibitory activity except for the beta-amino alcohol, which displaced almost 93% of [3H]glutamate from the glutamate receptors, suggesting that ADD 17014 may be functioning as a prodrug and an excitatory amino acid antagonist. The overall results indicate that ADD 17014 is a relatively nontoxic agent that more closely resembles PB and VPA, with a broad and unique spectrum of anticonvulsant activity.\r"

Fifty-three women with primary infertility fulfilling all entry criteria entered the study.

During the treatment period, 24 patients became pregnant, 20 of whom were donor (AID) pregnancies (out of 52 patients) and 4 were husband (AIH) pregnancies (out of 11 patients). Seventy-five percent of the pregnancies were intrauterine, whereas only 25% were from cervical inseminations. Sixty-two percent of the pregnancies were due to serum swim-up sperm preparations, and 38% were due to washed sperm preparations. The data indicate substantially higher pregnancy rates can be obtained with intrauterine insemination and suggest that additional studies are necessary to determine if the method of sperm preparation significantly influences pregnancy rates.\r"

Testes were perfused with glutaraldehyde, placed in osmium, and embedded in Epon 812 (Ladd Research Industries, Burlington, VT). Paired testicular weight, length of tubules, volume of seminiferous epithelium, and daily sperm production were significantly reduced in older men. Although the thickness of boundary tissue was greater (P less than 0.01) in older men, the volume of boundary tissue per man was similar between age groups. The percentages and volumes per man of boundary tissue myoid cells, collagen, microfibrils, and other components also were similar (P greater than 0.05) between age groups. This study confirms that age-related thickening of boundary tissue occurs without the new deposition (augmentation) of collagen or other extracellular components.\r"

Seminal plasma was found to be nontoxic to normal donor sperm. In three patients, frequent ejaculation (two ejaculates per day for 4 or 5 days) was used to deplete epididymal sperm reserves and reduce the period spent in the epididymis. This resulted in a threefold to sevenfold increase in percentage of motile sperm in the ejaculate and a similar increase in sperm motility index. The authors propose the term \"epididymal necrospermia\" to describe this previously undefined type of male infertility.\r"

The authors took into account the varying times to conception or loss to follow-up by using life table analysis. No statistically significant differences were found at the P = 0.05 level of significance. Cox's univariate and multiple regression models were then used to investigate the relationship between various semen characteristics and future fertility. Finding no significant influence of any semen characteristic on the cumulative probability of conception, the authors believe that using specific values of the semen analysis to estimate the potential for fertility of infertile couples is not useful.\r"

Gore and Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ) surgical membrane (SM), a nonreactive expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), was used in 24 mature New Zealand rabbits (2200 to 3000 gm) to cover 2-cm2 ischemic defects in the pelvic sidewall peritoneum to reduce adhesion formation in a rabbit pelvic sidewall/uterine horn injury model. SM was randomly assigned to cover one defect; the opposite defect remained uncovered, each animal serving as its own control. Rabbits were sacrificed 3 weeks later, and adhesions between uterine horn and pelvic sidewall or SM were scored for extent (0 to 4), type (0 to 4), and tenacity (0 to 3). Injury sites were removed en bloc for histologic study. The mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) adhesion score for SM-covered lesions (4.3 +/- 1.8) was significantly lower than for controls (9.1 +/- 2.5) (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon Signed Rank test). By histology, none of 24 SM-covered lesions demonstrated adhesions to the membrane itself, whereas 19 of the 24 control lesions showed dense adhesions to the injury site (P less than 0.001; chi-square test). By both gross and microscopic assessment, SM was nonadherent to the underlying sidewall defect in 100% of cases. In conclusion, Gore-Tex surgical membrane is an effective barrier for reducing primary adhesions in this pelvic injury model and offers promise for adhesion reduction in human pelvic surgery.\r"

There were no complications during salpingoscopy attributable to the endoscopic procedure itself, except for a minimal amount of bleeding occasionally noted on the tubal serosa at the site of forceps stabilization. A discordance of 23.5% was noted overall between the fimbrial appearance at surgery and salpingoscopic examination. This new technique of tubal evaluation may eventually help the reproductive surgeon to more accurately counsel the patient in the choice between tubal reconstructive surgery or IVF-ET, one of the most difficult decisions in reproductive surgery today.\r"

  ".W": "Healthy, regularly menstruating women were treated with the antiprogesterone RU 486, Mifepristone (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France) during the follicular phase of the cycle. Three women were given 25 mg of RU 486 on days 1 to 14 of the cycle and five received 25 mg on days 1 to 21 of the cycle. Venous blood samples were collected three times per week during a control cycle and during one treatment cycle in each subject. Serum concentrations of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), and RU 486 were determined by radioimmunoassays. No drug-related side effects and no spotting or bleeding during RU 486 treatment were observed. Menstrual bleeding was delayed by 8.7 +/- 3.8 days (mean +/- SD) after treatment over days 1 to 14 and by 12.6 +/- 3.2 days after treatment over days 1 to 21. During the treatment with RU 486, the serum concentrations of E2 remained low, indicating effective inhibition of folliculogenesis. After cessation of RU 486 treatment, serum E2 levels rose to similar values as in the control cycle, and subsequently serum P concentrations also reached ovulatory levels in six out of the eight volunteers. The results showed that the antiprogesterone RU 486 delayed folliculogenesis and luteinization even at low doses when given during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. It is speculated that this property of RU 486 could be utilized in the design of an estrogen-free combined oral contraceptives.\r"

In response to the deficit in rigorous experimental research, a longitudinal, exploratory study of 43 primary infertile couples was conducted. The study was conducted to determine if changes occurred in the marital relationships, sexual satisfaction, and levels of psychologic distress of the couples in the study as they progressed through the medical investigation of their infertility. Changes were assessed based on sex, diagnostic information, and time spent trying to conceive. Results indicated that significant distress was experienced by couples during the initial medical interview and at the time of diagnosis. Relationship quality did not appear to deteriorate as a result of the medical investigation; however, questions were raised regarding the sexual relationships of couples receiving an unexplained infertility diagnosis.\r"

In control subjects (n = 21), the forearm blood flow increased by greater than or equal to 2.8-fold at 30 s after ischemia. Diabetic subjects with glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) less than or equal to 9.5% (n = 15) exhibited a blood flow response that was not statistically different from normal control subjects. Diabetic subjects with GHb greater than or equal to 12.5% (n = 23) did not exhibit an increase in the postischemic blood flow. When blood flow patterns for the first 14 diabetic subjects were examined regardless of GHb value, four patterns of response were noted: 1) normal pattern (n = 3), 2) normal postischemic rise in blood flow with a prolonged elevation (n = 3), 3) no postischemic rise (n = 4), and 4) variable baseline blood flow with a decrease in blood flow postischemia (n = 4). This approach indicated that a comparison of means obscured potentially meaningful abnormal patterns. Abnormalities in the response of the transcutaneous oxygen tension to ischemia were observed in both groups of diabetic patients, but the difference between diabetic patients in good and poor control was less obvious. We have defined an abnormal response of blood flow and transcutaneous oxygen tension to ischemia that may correlate to glycemic control and have identified several patterns of blood flow after ischemia that may be important in defining the etiology and natural history of diabetic angiopathy.\r"

Prevalence was slightly lower in women (3.5%) than in men (4.3%), rose with age, and was highest in the group greater than 60 yr old (10.3%). In approximately 40% of the diabetic subjects, the diagnosis of diabetes was made as a result of the screening program. Association with a family history of diabetes, obesity, and the presence of other diseases was greater in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects. The prevalence of diabetes differed among different segments of the survey population when classified according to country of origin, being lowest in African and Asian (1.2%), intermediate in American and European (4.9%), and highest in Israeli born (5.5%); this order of prevalence is the reverse of that reported in earlier surveys. The results indicate that the overall diabetes prevalence in Israel, and that within the European- and American-born segment, is comparable to that reported in other westernized societies. The findings also suggest that environmental factors contribute to the phenotypic expression of the non-insulin-dependent genotype(s) but that the influence of such factors varies with different genetic backgrounds.\r"

Groups of 5 rats received either saline, spermidine (10 mumol daily), or spermine (6 mumol daily) orally on the 12th, 13th, and 14th postnatal days. The rats were killed on the 15th postnatal day. After the small bowel was removed, a 1-cm distal ileal segment was removed for histologic examination and the remaining small bowel tissue was homogenized for further biochemical analysis. Polyamine administration was shown to induce structural and biochemical mucosal changes characteristic of postnatal maturation. Lactase, sucrase, and maltase specific activities (micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per minute per gram of protein) were 80 +/- 10, 10 +/- 3, and 116 +/- 19 for the saline-treated rats; 51 +/- 7, 34 +/- 2, and 315 +/- 37 for the spermidine-treated rats; and 25 +/- 2, 46 +/- 5, and 419 +/- 63 for the spermine-treated rats, respectively. Similar results were obtained with rats, first treated with spermine (6 mumol) on the 7th postnatal day, receiving spermine (6 mumol) daily as described above and killed on the 10th postnatal day. Dose-response experiments performed as reported above in rats whose treatment began on the 12th postnatal day showed that the maturational effects of orally administered spermine are dose-dependent.\r"

We compared the tendencies of Americans and Bangladeshis to reduce digoxin by this pathway. Of 97 normal Americans in New York City, 34 (35.1%) were metabolizers in contrast to 14 of 100 Bangladeshis in Dhaka (p less than 0.002). Forty-three (35.8%) of 120 American patients in New York City receiving digoxin reduced the drug compared with 4 (13.8%) of 29 Bangladeshi patients in Dhaka (p less than 0.05). In Americans who emigrated to Dhaka or Bengali immigrants to New York City, the frequency of digoxin reduction product excretion was that of their country of origin. Fourteen Bengali immigrants who were nonmetabolizers when first studied in New York did not metabolize digoxin when restudied 4 yr later. In the Bangladeshis studied in Dhaka, income, education, and most strongly, urban residence during childhood correlated positively with digoxin inactivation. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the metabolic functions of the anaerobic gut flora may be determined by environmental factors operative early in life and tend to remain stable in adulthood. Interethnic variations in drug metabolism may be the consequence of differences in the intestinal microflora.\r"

Four patients with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis and 2 with arteriohepatic dysplasia were treated. Follow-up has been 3-8 yr. Patients with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis have been free of itching since surgery. Serum bile salt concentrations fell from 218-275 microM (normal less than 10) before to less than 10 microM after surgery. Biochemical tests of liver function and histology returned to normal or near normal. Patients with arteriohepatic dysplasia had persistent mild pruritus after surgery. Serum bile salt concentrations fell from 153-317 to 25-37 microM. There was little or no improvement in biochemical tests or histology. Bile volume and bile salt diverted were higher in patients with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis (7.3-13.0 ml/kg.day and 83-137 mumol/kg.day, respectively) than those with arteriohepatic dysplasia (3.2-4.5 ml/kg.day and 21-36 mumol/kg.day). The quality of life since surgery has been excellent in patients with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis, but not as optimal in those with arteriohepatic dysplasia. These findings suggest that partial external biliary diversion can provide effective relief from pruritus and perhaps reversal of liver disease in patients with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis. It should be used in patients with arteriohepatic dysplasia only in those with disabling pruritus.\r"

A 4-h i.v. infusion of low-dose (0.2 nmol/kg.h) or high-dose (1.0 nmol/kg.h) bombesin elicited significant increases in pancreatic juice volume and protein output, which were unaltered by treatment with L-364,718 at a dose capable of fully suppressing cholecystokinin-octapeptide-stimulated pancreatic juice volume and protein output. We conclude that the effects of exogenously administered bombesin on the exocrine pancreas in the rat are not mediated via release of endogenous cholecystokinin.\r"

Very similar results were obtained in 5 healthy individuals (coefficient of variation 4.8%, medians 0.35 and 0.34, respectively). By contrast, the fractional deconjugation rate assessed from zonal scanning of glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids on thin-layer chromatography was much less for 75SeHCAT than for [14C]CAT (0.02 and 0.13, respectively; p less than 0.05). The fractional rate for deconjugation plus dehydroxylation was also determined by zonal scanning, and gave lower values for 75SeHCAT than for [14C]CAT (0.02 and 0.12, respectively; p less than 0.05). There was a striking similarity between the fractional rate for deconjugation alone and that for deconjugation plus dehydroxylation for both bile acids in individual samples (r = 0.999, p less than 0.001), suggesting that these two processes might occur simultaneously and probably involve the same bacteria. We conclude that our scintiscanning technique provides an accurate, noninvasive method of measuring fractional turnover rate of a bile acid in humans, and that the finding that 75SeHCAT remains conjugated with taurine during enterohepatic recycling means that absorption should be specific for the ileal active transport site, thus rendering it an ideal substance for assessing ileal function.\r"

A frequently cited but unproven pathophysiologic mechanism for this phenomenon is reduced gallbladder muscle function, which results in stasis and allows for cholesterol gallstone crystal formation and gallstone growth. To date, gallbladder motor function has not been investigated in a well-characterized diabetic population. Therefore, using radionuclide cholescintigraphy, gallbladder filling and subsequent emptying produced in response to an infusion of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin in 30 diabetic patients and 20 control individuals were studied. No difference in any parameter used to assess gallbladder filling was demonstrated in the diabetics when compared with controls. In contrast, gallbladder emptying induced with cholecystokinin-octapeptide (20 ng/kg body wt . h) was reduced in diabetics compared with controls (55% +/- 5% vs. 74% +/- 4%, p less than 0.01). The peak emptying rate in the diabetics was also decreased (5.0% +/- 0.5% per minute) compared with the controls (7.0% +/- 0.6% per minute, p less than 0.02). The observed decreased gallbladder emptying found in diabetics was not related to obesity, type of diabetes, diabetic control, or presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy. The most severe impairment of gallbladder emptying occurred, however, in diabetics with an associated autonomic neuropathy. This subgroup demonstrated a significant reduction in the percentage of gallbladder emptying (40% +/- 8% vs. 62% +/- 5%, p less than 0.04) and the peak ejection rate (3.5% +/- 0.5% per minute vs. 5.6% +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.02) compared with the diabetics without autonomic neuropathy.\r"

The premises that 250-500-ml balloons are able to simulate \"satiety\" in a 1700-ml stomach sufficiently to cause weight loss, that the stomach will not stretch to accommodate such a besoar (with or without ulcerating), and that behavioral modification is cost-effective in weight control in this population have not been corroborated. Experience from gastric restrictive surgery has demonstrated the conceptual failure of gastric satiety as a means of achieving and sustaining weight loss in a substantial percentage of morbidly obese patients. Other methods are needed to reduce the increased morbidity and mortality of severe obesity.\r"

We studied the effect of increased intracranial pressure on gastric antral and duodenal contractility and gastric acid secretion in conscious rabbits. Intracerebroventricular pressure was maintained at 3, 8, or 13 cmH2O using normal saline perfused into the lateral cerebral ventricle and gastric antral and duodenal contractility was monitored using chronically implanted strain gauge force transducers. Gastric acid secretion was measured in a separate group of rabbits with chronically implanted gastric cannulas. Increased intracerebroventricular pressure (13 cmH2O) resulted in an immediate suppression of the amplitude of gastric and duodenal contractions by greater than 80% and greater than 60%, respectively. After normalization of intracerebroventricular pressure, the contractile pattern returned to basal levels. Intravenous bolus injection of bethanechol reversed the suppression of gastric antral contractility induced by increased intracranial pressure. Increased pressure for 2 h did not modify gastric acid output as compared with normal pressure controls, whereas atropine significantly inhibited and histamine stimulated gastric acid secretion in the same animals maintained at normal pressure. These results demonstrate that acutely increased intracranial pressure rapidly and reversibly inhibits gastric and duodenal motor function in conscious rabbits.\r"

Studies on coexistence revealed that the majority of reactive nerve fibers could be placed in one of two classes: (a) those fibers with reactivity to enkephalin or substance P, or both, and (b) fibers containing one or both of the peptides neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Many fibers immunoreactive for vasoactive intestinal peptide or neuropeptide Y, or both, were found throughout the external smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, but neuropeptide Y-reactive fibers were less common in the small and large intestines than in the stomach and esophagus. Fibers immunoreactive for enkephalin or substance P, or both, were sparse in the esophagus, increased in numbers to reach maximal frequency in the pylorus, and maintained a similar frequency in the small and large intestines. Fibers with somatostatin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity were rare. In general, sphincter regions were similar to nonsphincter regions in peptide-immunoreactive fiber numbers and types, except that the internal anal sphincter had no enkephalin-immunoreactive fibers and very few substance P-reactive fibers. Moderate numbers of fibers reactive for neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal peptide were found in the internal anal sphincter. It is suggested that enkephalin and substance P are in excitatory fibers and that vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y are in fibers inhibitory to the external muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic evidence shows a strong relationship between gastric cancer and cerebrovascular disease. It was speculated that salt intake might be the linking factor causing hypertension and vascular damage as well as damage to the gastric mucosa. This study tested whether hypertensive diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, occurred more frequently in patients with gastric cancer and gastric ulcer than expected by chance alone. In addition, it was studied whether gastric and duodenal ulcer coincided more frequently with other diseases that in the past have been associated with peptic ulcer, such as liver cirrhosis, chronic lung disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The German statistics of rehabilitation were used to assess the frequency of coincidences. The statistics include a description of the primary, secondary, and tertiary diagnoses leading to rehabilitation. This study confirms the presence of a high coincidence of both ulcer types with liver cirrhosis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, both ulcer types also occurred more frequently than expected from their general distribution. Gastric but not duodenal ulcer coincided more frequently with ischemic heart disease than expected. Gastric cancer occurred more frequently in patients who had concomitant ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease. Duodenal ulcer was not associated with an increased risk for any disease related to hypertension. The results of the study support the contention that gastric diseases and diseases related to hypertension share a common etiologic factor.\r"

Each normal man and 9 of 10 dialysis patients, when drained, emptied all 10 markers by 6 h after a test meal. In contrast, 5 of the 10 dialysis patients, when full, had delayed emptying of radiopaque markers. Thus, continuous ambulatory dialysis may delay gastric emptying of indigestible solids.\r"

  ".W": "Upper esophageal sphincter function was investigated during swallows of graded volumes in 8 normal volunteers. Concurrent recordings of video-fluoroscopic and manometric studies were obtained and correlated with each other by means of a videotimer. Maximal upper esophageal sphincter (UES) pressure was typically located 1.5 cm distal to the air-tissue interface between the hypopharynx and the proximal margin of the sphincter. The region in which UES pressure was greater than or equal to 50% maximal averaged 1.0 cm in length. Thus, the physiologic high-pressure zone of the UES corresponds in size and location to that of the cricopharyngeus muscle. Fluoroscopic analysis of sphincter movement indicated that the sphincter high-pressure zone moved 2.0-2.5 cm orally during swallowing and that the magnitude of the orad movement was directly related to the volume of barium swallowed. The maximal anterior-posterior diameter of sphincter opening during a swallow ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 cm and was also directly related to the volume swallowed. The intervals of UES opening and relaxation increased significantly with increasing bolus volume; the duration of UES relaxation ranged from a mean of 0.37 s for dry swallows to 0.65 s for 20-ml swallows. Thus, the dynamics of UES function during deglutition are dependent upon the volume of the swallowed bolus. Larger bolus volumes are accommodated by both an increased diameter of sphincter opening and by prolongation of the interval of sphincter relaxation. Analysis of the timing of other reference points within the pharyngeal swallow sequence indicated that as the manometric interval of UES relaxation increased, the period of laryngeal elevation was prolonged, the UES relaxed earlier and contracted later, and the interval between the onset of laryngeal elevation and hypopharyngeal contraction increased.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether the synthetic opiate loperamide-HCl is able to regulate specific transport systems for sodium and chloride in brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) from human ileum and whether such activities are mediated by calcium/calmodulin. In BBMVs we studied Na+/H+ antiport, Cl+/OH- antiport, Na+/Cl- cotransport, and the Cl- conductive pathway. Brush border membrane vesicles were incubated with 10 microM loperamide over 4 h at 5 degrees C before the uptake experiments. In ileal BBMVs, loperamide stimulated intravesicular accumulation of Na+ in the presence of Cl- and vice versa. After 1 min of incubation, the stimulatory effect was 35% +/- 5% (p less than 0.005) of the control without loperamide. Loperamide also stimulated Cl-/OH- antiport by 30% +/- 5% (p less than 0.005) in BBMVs of ileum. In addition, we studied the role of Ca2+/calmodulin in the action of loperamide on chloride transport by human BBMVs. In loperamide-pretreated BBMVs, calmodulin activity was significantly decreased (12 +/- 2 vs. 38 +/- 4 pmol/mg protein). When loperamide-pretreated vesicles were incubated with 2 microM calcium (free concentration) plus 5 microM calmodulin for 1 h at 5 degrees C, complete inhibition of the stimulatory effect of loperamide on Cl-/OH- antiport and Na+/Cl- cotransport was observed. Increasing the Ca2+/calmodulin activity of loperamide-pretreated BBMVs with 2 microM calcium plus 5 microM calmodulin led to a significant inhibition of Cl-/OH- antiport and Na+/Cl- cotransport by 40% +/- 5% (p less than 0.005).\r"
