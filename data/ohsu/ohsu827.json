Two distinct epitopes have been mapped on this new allele. The polymorphism in common with DRw8 and DRw12 is recognized by mAb GS313-9D11. However, alloreactive T cell clones specific for DR6b cells (Dw9) recognize this allele, whereas Dw8-specific T cell clones do not. The mAb determinant maps to the first beta-sheet and probably involves a polymorphic residue lying outside the helix. The binding of mAb 9D11 to this region does not interfere with TCR binding. Alloreactive T cell recognition is associated with polymorphisms located predominantly on the alpha-helical portion of the molecule.\r"

Plasma membrane-enriched fractions from stimulated, but not unstimulated, Th cells induced Ag nonspecific and MHC unrestricted proliferation of 60 to 70% of small dense B cells. Induction of stimulatory membrane activity was inhibited by cycloheximide, and the activity was eliminated by both protease and heat treatment of membranes. Membrane-stimulated B cells did not differentiate to secrete Ig; however, addition of a lymphokine-containing supernatant from activated Th cells or the combination of IL-4 and IL-5 resulted in substantial Ig production, predominantly of the IgM, IgG1, IgA, and IgE isotypes. The quantity and isotype distribution of the antibodies secreted were similar to those produced after B cell activation by the intact Th cells and Ag. Therefore, membranes from activated Th cells in combination with lymphokines normally secreted by such cells can replace intact Th cells and provide a defined system to identify molecular events important for B cell activation.\r"

The present study describes a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells that cannot be activated and progress into cell cycle by stimulation with anti-CD3 plus APC or with mitogenic combinations of anti-CD2. The in vitro responses of these anti-CD3-unresponsive CD4+ T cells were investigated with a panel of mAb to CD2, CD3, and CD28, and found to be similar to those previously observed for mature thymocytes: only the combination of anti-CD2 plus anti-CD28 produced cell proliferation. Anti-CD3-unresponsive T cells were CD45RA+, but represented only 14 to 22% of the CD4+, CD45RA+ T cell population. Activation with anti-CD2 plus anti-CD28 mAb resulted in major changes in the cell surface phenotype and functional properties: a loss of CD45RA+ occurred and an increased expression of CD45RO, CD29, and CD58 (LFA3), as well as a gain in responsiveness to anti-CD3 and anti-CD2. This change in CD45 phenotype from CD45RA to CD45RO occurs in both the anti-CD3-responsive and in the anti-CD3-unresponsive subsets of the CD45RA+, CD4+ cells after cell proliferation. The anti-CD3-unresponsive subset may represent a pool of not yet fully differentiated peripheral T cells. The acquisition of anti-CD3 responsiveness could occur as a consequence of Ag priming or by an Ag-independent mechanism. Involvement of the CD28 Ag in this process is suggested from the present study.\r"

  ".W": "Minor H incompatible P815 tumor cells inoculated into the anterior chamber (AC) of the eyes of BALB/c mice grow progressively, revealing this to be an immunologically privileged site. By contrast, a similar inoculation of tumor cells is rapidly rejected from nonprivileged ocular sites (subconjunctiva). Mice with progressively growing AC-tumors and those that reject their ocular subconjunctiva tumors both have expanded clones of tumor-specific cytotoxic precursor cells (pTc) in their spleens and cervical lymph nodes. In an effort to determine why the expanded pool of primed pTc is unable to effect rejection of AC intraocular tumors, we have examined the susceptibility of the tumor cells growing within the immunologically privileged AC to lysis by cytotoxic T cells and the cytotoxic function of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. P815 tumor cells extracted from intraocular tumors and P815 cells maintained in routine tissue culture are equally susceptible to lysis when exposed in vitro to fully differentiated, DBA/2-specific cytotoxic T cells. Thus, progressively growing tumor cells within the AC are not insensitive to immune-mediated lysis by cytotoxic T cells. We have been able to harvest significant numbers of DBA/2-specific pTc from these same intraocular tumors. When the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are driven in vitro with exogenous IL-2, they acquire the capacity to lyse specifically P815 tumor cells. However, no evidence of fully cytotoxic, tumor-specific T cells was found among lymphocytes harvested from intraocular tumors, i.e., when the harvested cells were tested immediately for cytolytic activity. Inasmuch as we have reported that directly cytotoxic T cells are present during tumor rejection at nonimmunologically privileged ocular sites, such as the subconjunctival space, we conclude that progressive growth of P815 tumor cells within the anterior chamber is due in part to a failure of infiltrating pTc to differentiate in situ into fully functional cytotoxic effector cells.\r"

The extent of internalization does not vary with several types of stimulation, including LPS, phorbol esters, anti-Ig-plus phorbol ester-stimulated EL-4 T cell supernatant, and Con A supernatant. Resting and activated B cells had similar rates of internalization. The rate and extent of uptake of surface Ia molecules into an intracellular compartment was monitored quantitatively through the use of a mAb radiolabeled with 125I. The internalization of Ia molecules was compared to that of transferrin receptor, a receptor that undergoes rapid internalization and recycling and accumulates in a intracellular pool that can be trapped by monensin. The internalization of Ia was not affected by monensin, although its synthetic pathway is disturbed by this drug. The potential use of internalized Ia for formation of T cell-triggering complexes of Ia and Ag fragments is not ruled out by these data, but it appears unlikely that internalization provides the major mechanism permitting Ia interaction with Ag.\r"

  ".W": "These studies examined the role of the MHC class II Ag in signal transduction using human B lymphocytes. Early events in signal transduction were considered including the intracellular calcium [Ca2+)i) flux, the activation of phospholipase C, and induction of protein phosphorylation. The (Ca2+)i was enhanced after incubation of B lymphocytes with several mAb anti-HLA class II and cross-linking with rabbit anti-mouse-F(ab')2. We have also demonstrated an enhancement of the (Ca2+)i in response to a suboptimal concentration of a monoclonal anti-IgM either in the presence of or after preincubation with a mAb anti-HLA class II. The activation of phospholipase C was assessed by measuring the generation of inositol phosphates in permeabilized B lymphocytes. mAb anti-HLA-class II of two different epitopes were used to demonstrate both the (Ca2+)i flux and the generation of inositol phosphates. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to investigate the phosphorylation pattern of resting B lymphocytes and the changes in the pattern after stimulation with soluble mAb anti-HLA-DR, immobilized mAb anti-HLA-DR, and PMA. In addition to the augmentation of phosphorylation observed with regard to phosphoproteins already present in resting B lymphocytes, new phosphorylations were observed after stimulation by any one of the reagents. Furthermore, stimulation by PMA did not result in an identical pattern to that observed after stimulation by mAb anti-HLA class II. An inhibition of the proliferative response to PMA was demonstrated after prestimulation of cells with immobilized mAb anti-HLA-DR, supporting the notion of a shared pathway of activation. In summary, these data demonstrate signal transduction via MHC class II Ag as assessed by three different measures of early events in human B lymphocyte activation and suggest that a protein kinase C pathway is at least partly involved.\r"

The subject of this report is the biochemical and functional characterization of what appears to be a novel murine lymphocyte cell surface antigen, provisionally termed sgp-60. Extensive, higher-order cross-linking of this glycoprotein with an anti-sgp-60 mAb and a second-step antibody reagent results in the activation of resting CD4+ T cells in the presence of a second signal. Monovalent or bivalent engagement of sgp-60 by the anti-sgp-60 antibody results in profound and direct inhibition of anti-CD3- or Con A-driven T cell activation, whereas alternative T cell activation via the phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins Thy-1 and TAP/Ly-6A is not affected. These findings raise the possibility that the sgp-60 molecule may be specifically involved in signal transduction through the TCR/CD3 complex and thus point to an important physiologic role for this protein in CD4+ T cells.\r"

  ".W": "UVB radiation distorts the Ag-presenting function of epidermal Langerhans cells (LC); this has been shown for the presentation of soluble Ag to primed T cells in vitro and for the initiation of delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo, such as contact hypersensitivity (CH). Previous work has also demonstrated UVB-induced suppression of CH to be mediated ultimately by T cells. Two subsets of CD4+ Th cells, Th1 and Th2, have been identified, based on their cytokine production and functional activities. In particular, Th1 mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity, whereas Th2 do not. To investigate whether the perturbation of LC function induced by UVB radiation leads to a differential activation of these subsets of CD4+ cells, we examined the capacity of unirradiated and irradiated (200 J/m2) APC from adult BALB/c mice to present keyhole limpet hemocyanin to Ag-specific, H2d-restricted Th1 and Th2 cell lines. Four sources of APC were utilized: epidermal cells (EC), flow microfluorometry-purified Ia+ EC (LC), flow microfluorometry-purified Ia- EC, and splenic adherent cells (SAC). Unirradiated EC, LC, and SAC, but not Ia-EC, presented keyhole limpet hemocyanin to both Th1 and Th2. Irradiated EC and LC lost their ability to stimulate Th1, but retained fully their capacity to stimulate Th2. On the other hand, irradiated SAC were unable to induce proliferation of either Th1 or Th2. These findings indicate that suppression of CH mediated by UVB-irradiated LC may result from an alteration of the ratio and/or activity of Th1 and Th2 cells normally generated during the induction of such responses.\r"

The objective of our study was to analyze GvH reactivity induced by a single T cell clone specific for host I-A or I-E alloantigen. The T cell clones tested for GvH potential were CD4+, with or without cytolytic activity in vitro and with a lymphokine pattern that classifies them as Th1 cells. The inoculation of a single T cell clone induced a severe, but transient immunodeficiency in the host that was independent of its cytolytic activity, as demonstrated by the failure to generate a CTL response to third party allogeneic cells in vitro. Induction of immunodeficiency in the recipients required preactivation of the clones in vitro by rIl-2 and the presence of the stimulator class II alloantigen in the host. Spleen cells from these mice lacked suppressor cells, they were deficient in Il-2 secretion and exhibited a decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells. In addition, I-E expression was reduced, however, without any changes in the macrophage population and an increase in surface Ig and the B cell marker B220. Simultaneous to the immunodeficiency, the clone-injected mice produced elevated antibody titers to ssDNA.\r"

Surprisingly, however, whole anti-Ig was unable to inhibit induction of transferrin receptor (TfR) expression by LPS or F(ab')2 anti-Ig. Indeed, whole anti-Ig on its own induced TfR as early as 4 h. TfR induction by F(ab')2 anti-Ig and by LPS was accompanied by an early increase in TfR mRNA, and was prevented by inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis and therefore can be ascribed to a transcriptional mechanism. In contrast, whole anti-Ig induced TfR even in the presence of protein and RNA synthesis inhibitors. Little or no TfR mRNA was detectable after 4 or 16 h of exposure to whole anti-Ig, whereas increased TfR mRNA was evident after 4 h of F(ab')2 anti-Ig or LPS. Antibody to the Fc gamma R (2.4G2) restores the ability of whole anti-Ig to generate increased TfR expression via the transcriptional route. We conclude that whole anti-Ig induces TfR mostly by using preexisting TfR molecules through a mechanism different from the transcriptional mechanism triggered by F(ab')2 anti-Ig and LPS.\r"

  ".W": "The relative contribution of individual non-H-2 Ag and of T cell subsets that initiate graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR) as well as the mechanism responsible for histopathologic lesions are still a matter of debate. To address these questions and to favor the selection of T cells primed in vivo against non-H-2 Ag important in GVHR we derived T cell clones from spleens of (DBA/2 x B10.D2)F1 (H-2d) mice developing this reaction after the graft of B10.D2 (H-2d) cells incompatible for numerous non-H-2 Ag plus Mlsa. The pattern of reactivity of eight selected clones against cells from different strains of mice including (BXD)RI strains indicated that one CD4+ clone is specific for Mlsa and seven additional clones (six CD4+ and one CD8+) are specific for four different non-H-2 Ag (Ag.I-IV) and proliferate in an H-2-restricted manner. The same series of experiments suggested that Ag.I and II are poorly polymorphic and allowed to propose the localisation of the genes controlling Ag.I (chromosome 1) and Ag.III (chromosome 4). All the clones show a triple (alpha, beta, gamma) mRNA transcript for TCR but at their surface they express the alpha/beta-heterodimer. The clone specific for Mlsa expresses V beta 6 and that specific for Ag.IV expresses V beta 8.1. Rapid mortality accompanied by clinical and histologic signs of severe GVHR was observed after administration of CD4+ clones (together with host-syngeneic bone marrow) derived early after grafting and specific for Ag.I and II but not after administration of: 1) CD8+ cytolytic clone derived early after grafting and specific for Ag.IV; 2) CD4+ clones derived late after grafting and specific for Ag.III; and 3) CD4+ clone specific for Mlsa. A clear correlation was established between the capacity of CD4+ clones to induce GVHR mortality, to mediate host-specific DTH and to release a high level of TNF. In conclusion: 1) the reaction against a single non-H-2 Ag is sufficient to provoke lethal GVHR; 2) the capacity to provoke GVHR mortality depends on antigenic specificity and functional properties of the responding clones; 3) the inflammatory process mediated by CD4+ clones may play a major role whereas the specific CD8+ T cell-mediated cytolytic activity is not necessarily lethal.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently reported the presence of IgG which has a potent inhibitory activity against IL-1 alpha in some sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanism of this inhibition by IgG against IL-1 alpha is now elucidated. IgG with IL-1 alpha-inhibitory activity inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha to receptors on rheumatoid synovial cells. In addition, preincubation of synovial cells with the inhibitory IgG did not block the binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha to receptors, suggesting a direct interaction between IgG and IL-1 alpha. To examine which region of the IgG, namely Fab or Fc region, has the inhibitory activity, the IgG was digested with papain, and Fab and Fc fragments were purified. Fab fragments, but not Fc fragments, inhibited both IL-1 alpha-induced thymocyte-proliferation and the binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha to receptors. We further demonstrated that the inhibitory IgG which was bound to protein A Sepharose could bind a significant amount of 125I-IL-1 alpha, whereas only a negligible binding of the radiolabeled ligand was detected when IgG without the inhibitory activity was used as control. Moreover, the binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha to IgG with the inhibitory activity was clearly blocked by Fab fragments of IgG having the inhibitory activity. Finally, affinity-purified IgG over an IL-alpha affinity column showed approximately 100-fold more potent inhibitory activity on IL-1 alpha-induced thymocyte proliferation compared with untreated IgG. From these results, we conclude that IgG molecules with IL-1-alpha-inhibitory activity are neutralizing autoantibodies against IL-1 alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Our studies show that in connective tissue cells, induction of PGE2 synthesis in response to IL-1 requires costimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In cells incubated in medium containing fresh serum, IL-1 induced a dose-dependent synthesis of PGE2. However, when the cells were incubated in medium containing low serum or platelet poor plasma (lacking PDGF), IL-1 alone failed to induce PGE2 synthesis. PGE2 synthesis was restored when platelet poor plasma was supplemented with PDGF. Addition of PDGF or FGF together with IL-1 resulted in a 14- and 66-fold stimulation of PGE2 synthesis, respectively. Stimulation was dependent on the concentration of both IL-1 and the growth factor. PGE2 synthesis was also dependent on the synthesis of new proteins. In cells simultaneously treated with IL-1 and PDGF, PGE2 synthesis was initiated after a lag of 2 to 3 h, proceeded first with a rapid rate for 6 h, and then with a slower rate through 24 h. PGE2 synthesis during the latter, slower phase was greatly enhanced by pretreatment with PDGF, but not by pretreatment with IL-1. PDGF pretreatment also resulted in maintenance of 10- to 12-fold higher cell surface IL-1-binding during this phase. These data provide evidence for potentially novel interactions between PDGF and IL-1 activities, one of which is the modulation of IL-1 receptors by PDGF. Furthermore, these studies suggest that by virtue of their effect on IL-1 activities, PDGF and FGF may play additional roles in connective tissues, including an indirect role in inflammatory processes.\r"

  ".U": "90375913\r", 
  ".W": "The receptor for IL-2 has been known to exist in three forms on the basis of their affinities to IL-2: high, intermediate, and low affinity forms. Two IL-2R components have been identified as IL-2R alpha (p55, Tac Ag) and IL-2R beta (p70-75) chains, both bind IL-2 with low and intermediate affinities, respectively. Recently, we cloned human IL-2R beta chain cDNA and demonstrated that the cDNA product binds IL-2 with intermediate affinity and forms high affinity IL-2R with coexpressed IL-2R alpha chain in a human T cell line, Jurkat. In this study, we report the establishment of the mouse fibroblast transformants expressing either the IL-2R beta chain alone or both the IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta chains. In contrast to lymphoid cells, significant IL-2 binding was not detected in the transformants expressing the IL-2R beta chain alone at IL-2 concentrations (50 pM to 10 nM) generally utilized. Nonetheless, the transformants expressing both IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta chains displayed two forms of the IL-2R with high and low affinities to IL-2. However, neither IL-2 internalization nor signal transduction via the high affinity IL-2R complex were observed in the L929 transformants. Those findings suggest that the interaction of the IL-2R beta chain with the IL-2R alpha chain occurs in the absence of additional lymphoid specific component(s) to form high affinity IL-2R, but that this interaction is insufficient for IL-2 internalization and signal transduction just as observed in lymphoid cells. The experimental approach described here may allow further dissection of the molecular architecture of the IL-2R complex in the ligand binding, internalization, and signal transduction.\r"

Among the Ab2, a mAb AB19-4 was characterized by both serologic and biologic methods to be paratope-specific (Ab2 beta), bearing the internal image of the neutralization site. AB19-4 was found to bind specifically to BAT123 and also to its mouse-human chimeric form in ELISA. The binding of AB19-4 to BAT123 was specifically inhibited by HTLV-IIIB gp120 and the synthetic epitope peptides of HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIMN defined by BAT123. AB19-4 also inhibited the binding of BAT123 to HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells in flow cytometric studies. Polyclonal goat and sheep antisera against HTLV-IIIB gp120 reacted specifically with AB19-4, suggesting that AB19-4 may recognize cross-species idiotopes. Rabbits immunized with purified AB19-4 generated anti-anti-Id antibodies (Ab3) that reacted specifically with HTLV-IIIB gp120 and the BAT123-binding epitope peptides of HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIMN. The Ab3 bound to H9 cells infected by HTLV-IIIB or HTLV-IIIMN and inhibited the infection of CEM cells by HTLV-IIIB or HTLV-IIIMN, whereas BAT123 also bound H9 cells infected by HTLV-IIIB or HTLV-IIIMN but neutralized only HTLV-IIIB. Our data suggest that AB19-4 mimics the neutralization site on HIV-1 gp120 defined by BAT123. The induction of immunity to HIV using internal-image Ab2 to HIV-neutralizing antibodies may provide a viable approach for developing effective vaccines for AIDS.\r"

We have identified one of these coprecipitated molecules as the 16-kDa Leu-13 Ag. 5A6 and anti-Leu-13 showed similar, although not identical, reactivity, growth inhibition and temperature-dependent aggregation effects among hematolymphoid cell lines. The aggregation induced by 5A6 and anti-Leu-13 was not dependent on LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1). The cell-surface expression of both TAPA-1 (target of an antiproliferative antibody-1) and Leu-13 could be down-modulated by binding to their respective antibodies and they could be reciprocally comodulated. These results suggest that TAPA-1 and Leu-13 form a complex on the cell surface and play a role in growth control through a common pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Most cell surface proteins are anchored to the cell bilayer by hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains. Recently it has been shown that a small class of molecules are attached to cell surfaces via a phosphatidylinositol moiety covalently linked to the C-terminus of the mature processed polypeptide. The molecular signals that identify a polypeptide for phosphatidylinositol (PI) attachment have not been well defined in any system, but are thought to reside in the C-terminus of the primary translation product. We report that all the signals responsible for PI anchoring of Qa-2 Ag are confined to the 36 C-terminal residues of the precursor proteins. To investigate further the features that signal cleavage and PI addition, we have studied mutants of two closely related murine class I MHC molecules: the PI-linked Ag, Q9b, from the Qa-2 Ag family, and the integral membrane transplantation antigen, H-2Ld. The addition of 15 amino acids to the three residue long cytoplasmic domain of Q9b or the mutation of Asp295 found in its C-terminal hydrophobic domain to Val converts this molecule into an integral membrane protein. However, the introduction of a short three residue cytoplasmic tail and Asp295 into the transmembrane domain of H-2Ld does not convert this molecule to a PI-linked one. The results of these analyses suggest that the PI-processing signals may depend on overall conformation, hydrophobicity, and length of the C-terminal domain of the precursor protein. In addition these data indicate that PI anchoring of class I Ag requires more than two mutational steps and may have been selected during the evolution.\r"

  ".W": "Activated macrophages have been demonstrated to metabolize the amino acid L-arginine by the oxidative pathway to produce nitric oxide, citrulline, and NO2-/NO3-. Nitric oxide has been shown to be cytostatic for tumor targets and to inhibit the mitochondrial respiration and other functions of the macrophages that produce it. Addition of NG monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA), a competitive inhibitor of oxidative L-arginine metabolism, to rat splenocyte (SPL) MLC results in allospecific lymphocyte proliferation and CTL induction. In the absence of NMA, neither proliferation nor CTL induction is observed. Citrulline and NO2-/NO3- levels in the supernatants of rat SPL MLC are decreased in the presence of NMA compared with cultures without NMA. NMA also augments the proliferation and CTL induction in mouse SPL MLC. Detectable levels of cytokines able to induce T cell proliferation were present in supernatants of rat SPL MLC without NMA on days 1 to 5 of culture. Supernatants of cultures with NMA contained detectable levels of cytokines on days 1 to 3 and undetectable levels by days 4 and 5 of culture, concomitant with the observed lymphocyte proliferation and presumed depletion of cytokines. Thus, inhibition of rat SPL proliferation to alloantigen seems not to be caused by the lack of production of cytokines able to induce T cell proliferation. The inhibition of proliferation and CTL induction in rat SPL cultures may be caused by a direct effect of the cytostatic products of oxidative L-arginine metabolism on lymphocyte proliferation, or by an indirect deleterious effect on the mitochondrial respiration and viability of macrophages that oxidatively metabolize L-arginine. Alternatively, diversion of L-arginine to the oxidative pathway may affect production of polyamines that are necessary for cell growth and proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine, an endogenously released purine, modulates the functions of many cells through surface A1 and A2 receptors. We examined the hypothesis that adenosine receptor ligation regulates Fc gamma R-triggered inflammatory response by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), a response which is critical to the pathogenesis of immune complex diseases. The effects of adenosine analogs on Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and superoxide anion (O2-) generation in human neutrophils were investigated. 5'(N-ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine (NECA), the most potent A2 receptor agonist, inhibited Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and O2- generation, whereas N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a highly selective A1 receptor agonist, enhanced these functions. The effects of the adenosine analogs were markedly accentuated in neutrophils adherent to biologic surfaces. Both the inhibition by NECA and the enhancement by CPA of PMN Fc gamma R functions were blocked by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline, which suggests that occupancy of surface adenosine receptors mediated the actions of these analogs. Because A1 receptors on PMN are linked to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, our evidence that pertussis toxin blocked the effects on Fc gamma R function brought about by CPA but not by NECA further supports the hypothesis that CPA acts via an A1 receptor. Our data indicate that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors modulate neutrophil Fc gamma R function in opposing ways, allowing for a concentration-dependent, adenosine-regulated feed-back loop. At low concentrations there is enhancement of neutrophil Fc gamma R function via PMN A1 receptors, whereas at higher concentrations (those which may occur at sites of damaged tissues), there is inhibition via A2 receptors. Our observation that adenosine analogs had more potent effects on adherent neutrophils emphasizes the potential importance of adenosine as a modulator of Fc gamma R-triggered inflammation in vivo.\r"

In contrast, little is known about the Th cell determinants present on HSV that are required for anti HSV gD antibody production. In our study we have immunized BALB/c mice with a recombinant source of HSV-1 gD lacking the carboxyl-terminal 93 amino acids. T cell hybridomas produced from the immunized animals recognized a single antigenic peptide (amino acids 246-261) in the context of I-Ad. The determinant expressed by gD peptide 246-261 was generated and presented by both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected APC. Fine specificity analysis using truncated synthetic gD peptides revealed that the minimal amino acids recognized by the T hybrids were identical between HSV-1 and HSV-2. In addition, the minimal peptide-I-Ad binding analysis demonstrated that the minimal peptide sequence required for the binding to I-Ad and for T cell recognition contained two prolines. Thus, this important HSV antigenic determinant would not be expected to form an amphipathic alpha-helix and could therefore be missed by algorithms currently used to predict which amino acid sequences would be antigenic based on the propensity to form helices.\r"

Our study describes the protective efficacy against microfilaremia in mice, immunogenicity, and parasite stage-specificity of this candidate vaccine molecule. Immunization of Swiss or BALB/c mice with 1 to 3 micrograms of a 92-kDa trpE fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-479 reduced the intensity of microfilaremia by 40 to 60% compared to control animals given buffer or bacterial trpE (p less than 0.01 to 0.001). Mice immunized with the 92-kDa fusion protein developed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity to B. malayi as assessed by enhanced footpad swelling 24 and 48 h after intradermal injection of adult worm extract and in vitro lymph node mononuclear cell proliferation (3H-thymidine uptake) in response to the fusion protein (mean +/- SD stimulation index 4.7 +/- 0.8 vs 2.0 +/- 1.4 for trpE, p less than 0.05). Proliferative responses of lymph node cells coincubated with three other fusion proteins corresponding to the filarial protein truncated from its carboxyl-terminus suggest that dominant T cell epitopes of the 62-kDa Ag are encompassed by amino acids 437-479. Rabbit antibody to the 92-kDa trpE fusion protein immunoprecipitated a 62-kDa polypeptide from [35S] methionine biosynthetically labeled B. malayi microfilariae, adult female, and adult male worms. These data indicate that a recombinant Ag expressed in several developmental stages of B. malayi is capable of inducing partial resistance against microfilariae and Ag-specific T cell responses in mice.\r"

One was expressed on HBsAg irrespective of the four major subtypes, i.e., adw, adr, ayw, and ayr, whereas the other was subtypic but not identical to any of d, y, w, and r determinants. The common determinant was generated by a synthetic pentadecapeptide with a sequence of Thr-Thr-Ser-Thr-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gln representing amino acids 115-129 of the S gene product, and detected invariably in 366 HBsAg samples in sera from asymptomatic carriers in Japan. The activity of the S gene product, as well as the peptide (115-129), to bind with the mAb was not affected by alkylation alone, but was completely lost after reductive alkylation. The antigenic activity was lost when the S gene product was severed between Lys122 and Thr123 by trypsin. A microconformation maintained by the -Cys121-Cys124 bond, therefore, would be required for the common determinant. The other mAb identified an epitope of HBsAg that was mimicked by a synthetic tetradecapeptide with a sequence of Thr-Cys-Thr-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gln-Gly-Thr-Ser-Met-Phe-Pro-Ser, representing amino acids 123-136 of the S gene product. Among 16 HBsAg samples with known S gene sequences, 5 with Ile126 possessed this subtypic determinant, but the remaining 11 with Thr126 did not. The 5 hepatitis B virus genomes encoding the subtypic determinant differed less than 5.6% from each other in the entire nucleotide sequence, but by 8.0% or more from any of the other 11 genomes without the capacity to encode it.\r"

The effect of the induced anti-idiotypic response upon clonotypic cellular reactivity was assessed in vitro through the suppression of antigen-mediated blast transformation by cloned T cells and in vivo by suppression of resistance to S. mansoni and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses against specific Ag. Differential regulation of humoral immune responses was studied at the levels of specific epitopic recognition, the expression of specific Id, and the production of anti-idiotypic responses directed against mAb bearing specific Id. Anti-idiotypic sensitization resulted in variable (10 to 90%) suppression of the immune response to discrete antigenic epitopes, the expression of specific idiotypic phenotypes, and anti-idiotypic, antiparatopic responses against T cell clonotypes and antibody idiotypic phenotypes. In vitro admixture and in vivo challenge studies resulted in consonant differential suppression. Thus idiotypic regulation can mold the fine specificities of the protective immune response to S. mansoni at the clonal level and may provide an approach to optimize the expression and assessment of resistance.\r"

  ".W": "We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the expressed VH and Vk genes from 13 secondary (2 degrees) hemagglutinin (HA) (Sb) specific hybridomas derived from a single mouse. These antibodies share an Id, H37-68 (68Id) that dominates the 2 degrees HA(Sb) response in this mouse, but is rare or absent from 2 degrees responses of other mice. We find that these antibodies derive from five clones. The H chains of these antibodies are encoded by a single VH gene joined to a variety of DH and JH genes. The length of complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 and sequence of the D-J junction are restricted, suggesting selection on CDR3 of the H chain. The L chains are more diverse. In the presented examples, they are encoded by the Vk21C and Vk21E genes and a Vk9 gene, and are joined to Jk1, 2, or 4. Each antibody is extensively mutated. The nature and distribution of the mutations suggests that 68Id-producing cells have been selected by Ag, although there are differences regarding the domain (VH, Vk, or both) in which mutations were selected. The implications of these findings on the idiosyncratic nature of the 68Id antibody response to HA(Sb) are discussed. There are two unusual characteristics regarding somatic mutation in these hybridomas. Whereas the expressed VH and Vk21 genes appear to have accumulated mutations at a high rate (1 to 1.5 x 10(-3)/base pairs/division, the expressed Vk9 genes appear to have accumulated mutations at a 5 to 15-fold lower rate than the expressed VH genes in the same cells. There is also a surprisingly high number of parallel silent somatic mutations in the VH genes, of which all but one are clustered to a 28-bp region in framework region 2 and CDR 2-encoding segments. The probability that this could have occurred by a random mutational process is essentially zero.\r"

  ".W": "Infection and transformation by human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) up-regulates expression of several inducible genes including those coding for cytokines involved in the proliferation of normal and leukemic T cells. We demonstrate that HTLV-I can also shut off expression of the CD3-gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta genes that code for the constant elements of the TCR for Ag. In addition, the T cell-specific CD3-epsilon enhancer was found to be inactive in a HTLV-I-infected T cell clone. This HTLV-I-infected T cell clone (827-p19-II) that could be cultured in the absence of IL-2 lacked the CD3 proteins but did express the TCR-alpha and -beta proteins intracellularly. In the absence of the CD3-gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta polypeptide chains the disulfide bridged TCR-alpha/beta heterodimer was not formed and the Ag receptor did not appear at the cell surface. These results allowed two major conclusions: first, HTLV-I infection has an effect on the T cell specific regulatory elements that coordinately regulate CD3-gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta expression and second, the CD3-gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta proteins are necessary for formation and routing the variable TCR-alpha/beta (or -gamma/delta) heterodimer to the human T cell surface.\r"

Although this Ag is undetectable by flow microfluorimetry analysis, normal cells have been shown to express the A1 Ag by immunoprecipitation experiments performed on surface radioiodinated spleen and thymus cells. We (J. Immunol. 143:1379, 1989) and others (J. Immunol. 142:1727, 1989) have recently isolated cDNA encoding the Ly-49 Ag. Southern blots with an Ly-49 cDNA probe revealed multiple bands, consistent with cross-hybridization to other members of a multigene family, and significant RFLP between the C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains. When the RFLP patterns displayed by other common laboratory strains as well as informative recombinant inbred strains were examined, the Ly-49 gene family displayed five RFLP patterns and the entire family was found to reside on a contiguous stretch of the distal portion of mouse chromosome 6, the same region to which the NK1.1 Ag has been mapped. Although tissue distribution studies and transfection analysis ruled out the possibility that Ly-49 was identical to NK1.1 Ag, approximately 20% of NK1.1 cells isolated from normal spleen coexpressed Ly-49 and all Ly-49+ cells were CD3-. Although spleen cells cultured in high doses of rIL-2 demonstrated similar coexpression of NK1.1 and Ly-49, approximately 10% of CD3+ cells coexpressed Ly-49. The chromosomal mapping data and the expression of the Ly-49 and NK1.1 Ag suggest that the NK1.1 Ag may be a member of the Ly-49 multigene family.\r"

Numerous developments hold a promise for making the 1990's the most rewarding decade of the 20th century for neurosurgery. The \"Decade of the Brain\" resolution, adopted by the United States House and Senate and signed into law by President Bush in 1989, has provided the specialty with staggering opportunities. Neurosurgery and the basic and clinical neurosciences would be strengthened by the development of a major new philanthropic organization called the \"American Brain Association\" that would carry the activities of the Decade of the Brain into the 21st century. Major efforts are being made to improve organized neurosurgery's responsiveness to member needs. These include the strategic planning project undertaken by the Board of Directors of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and efforts to strengthen the Joint Council of State Neurosurgical Societies. The AANS has been extremely active in representing the specialty in legislative matters in Washington and in multiple other forums. This Association has joined The American Board of Neurological Surgery and the Residency Review Committee in responding to orthopedic surgery's proposal for spine fellowships. It is proposed that the logo of the state, regional, and national neurosurgical societies be changed to depict our involvement in spinal surgery (as well as brain surgery) because spinal surgery represents more than half of the total effort of this specialty. The standards of worth and value that provide the driving force behind our work emphasize the need to grow in compassion as manifested by our kindness, sincerity, and concern as we grow in professional competence as reflected by our training, knowledge, and skill.\r"

There were no operative complications of aggravation of cranial nerve palsies in this series.

All patients entered the study within 3 hours of the ictus. In this series, 111 patients were treated conservatively and 69 surgically. The neurological condition of each patient was measured by means of a newly proposed grading system for intracerebral hemorrhage-intracranial hemorrhage (ICH grade) which is a modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale. Serial CT scans revealed that most hemorrhages were completed within 6 hours after ictus. Based on the ICH grade at 6 hours postictus, a clinical classification of the severity of putaminal hemorrhage was defined: fulminant, rapidly progressive, slowly progressive, and nonprogressive. According to this classification, precise time courses of the ICH grade were compared between the conservative and surgical treatment groups in a 7-day postictal period. Activities of daily living at 6 months after ictus were also compared. Surgical treatment for a rapidly progressive hemorrhage appears to be beneficial if undertaken in patients under 65 years of age. Surgery in a slowly progressive hemorrhage should be considered only in a small number of patients who deteriorate neurologically with conservative treatment. In this series of patients, surgical treatment of fulminant and nonprogressive hemorrhage was not likely to improve the quality of life or functional recovery. Regardless of treatment modality, CT provided evidence that patients with anterior capsular hemorrhage (16% in this series) showed good recovery of motor and speech function.\r"

Transfemoral selective arterial catheterization was performed in most of these cases. A radiolucent operating table was used in all cases, and a radiolucent head-holder in most. In five of the 57 aneurysm procedures, clip repositioning was required after intraoperative angiography demonstrated an inadequate result. In five of the 48 AVM procedures, intraoperative angiography demonstrated residual AVM nidus which was then located and resected. In two cases intraoperative angiography failed to identify residual filling of an aneurysm which was seen later on postoperative angiography, and in one case the intraoperative study failed to demonstrate a tiny residual fragment of AVM which was seen on conventional postoperative angiography. Two complications resulted from intraoperative angiography: one patient developed aphasia from cerebral embolization and one patient developed leg ischemia from femoral artery thrombosis. This technique appears to be of particular value in the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations.\r"

None of the four patients who had undergone radical excision of their tumor and who had reached the age of finishing high school was able to work independently.

The rate of tumor recurrence or of failure to respond to treatment was 57% (four of a total of seven survivors) following radical surgery and 7% (two of 27 survivors) after conservative operations and irradiation. The overall mortality rate was 8%; the causes of the three deaths were: \"hypothalamic crisis\" 1 year after radical resection; progressive tumor growth despite two attempts at resection and irradiation; and a brain-stem glioma in the field of irradiation 8 years after treatment.\r"

Thirteen patients (1.8%) experienced seizures within 2 weeks postoperatively. Five of these patients (0.7% of the series) had seizures within 24 hours after operation. The incidence was highest for patients with medulloblastoma (7.2%) followed by those with astrocytoma (2.3%). Also, a higher percentage was found in patients with preoperative ventriculoperitoneal shunt or intraoperative ventriculostomy (2.7%) than in those without (1%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Metabolic acidosis (80%) and hyponatremia (20%) were the major causes of the seizures that developed within 24 hours after operation. Follow-up computerized tomography showed no definite lesion in these patients. Hydrocephalus (75%) and supratentorial hemorrhage remote from the operative site (25%) were detected in the patients who developed seizures between the 2nd and 14th postoperative day. Two of these patients also had postoperative bacterial meningitis. This review suggests that seizures are a possible complication in the early postoperative period after suboccipital craniectomy for posterior fossa lesions.\r"

The authors report the results of a retrospective review of 30 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastases from kidney cancer. Seventeen patients (57%) were operated on after failing radiation therapy. Prior to operation, selective spinal angiography and embolization were performed in 17 patients with no permanent neurological deficits resulting. Gross total resection of the tumor and stabilization of the spine were then accomplished with acceptable blood loss. Twenty-seven (90%) of the 30 patients improved neurologically following surgery. There was a median survival time of 16 months, a 2-year survival rate of 33%, and a 5-year survival rate of 15%. Major surgical complications in this series were related to excessive blood loss in patients without embolization. These data suggest that patients with spinal metastases from kidney cancer should undergo spinal angiography and embolization prior to resection of the tumor. To improve upon current results, such treatment should be carried out prior to external radiation therapy.\r"

Five adult patients with a cavernous angioma underwent local cortical blood flow studies and vascular pressure measurements during surgery for the excision of the cavernous angioma. Clinical presentation included headache in four patients, seizures in four patients, and recurring diplopia in one patient. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the cavernous angiomas in all patients and revealed an associated small hematoma in two. Four patients with a cerebral cavernous angioma were operated on in the supine position and the remaining patient, whose lesion involved the brain stem, was operated on in the sitting position. Mean local cortical blood flow (+/- standard error of the mean) in the cerebral cortex adjacent to the lesion was 60.5 +/- 8.3 ml/100 gm/min at a mean PaCO2 of 35.0 +/- 0.6 torr. Mean CO2 reactivity was 1.1 +/- 0.2 ml/100 gm/min/torr. The local cortical blood flow results were similar to established normal control findings. Mean pressure within the lesion in the patients undergoing surgery while supine was 38.2 +/- 0.5 mm Hg; a slight decline in cavernous angioma pressure occurred with a drop in mean systemic arterial blood pressure and PaCO2. Mean pressure in the cavernous angioma in the patient operated on in the sitting position was 7 mm Hg. Jugular compression resulted in a 9-mm Hg rise in cavernous angioma pressure in one supine patient but no change in the patient in the sitting position. Direct microscopic observation revealed slow circulation within the lesions. The hemodynamic features demonstrated in this study indicate that cavernous angiomas are relatively passive vascular anomalies that are unlikely to produce ischemia in adjacent brain. Frank hemorrhage would be expected to be self-limiting because of relatively low driving pressures.\r"

In an attempt to clarify the natural history of the lesion and suggest an appropriate management strategy, the authors review their experience with 30 patients. In four patients with cerebellar venous angioma, an acute episode of ataxia was documented. The coexistence of a cavernous malformation was pathologically confirmed in the two patients who underwent surgery for bleeding presumed caused by the venous angioma. Infarction was shown in two patients and a tumor in two others. Follow-up periods ranged between 18 and 104 months, with only five patients symptomatic at the time of this report. Rebleeding had not occurred, nor had acute episodes of neurological dysfunction been documented. This clinical experience suggests that a venous malformation is frequently associated with other, more symptomatic conditions and is often erroneously identified as the source of the symptoms. Because the nature of the relationship between the venous malformation and the allied conditions remains ambiguous, it is recommended that patients harboring a \"symptomatic\" venous malformation undergo high-field magnetic resonance imaging to rule out underlying pathology, and that any such pathology be treated independently of the venous malformation.\r"

  ".W": "Forty dogs were subjected to 6 hours of occlusion of the left internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. They were divided into two \"hemodilution groups\" of 13 dogs each and a control \"nonhemodiluted group\" of 14 dogs. Thirty minutes after arterial occlusion, isovolemic hemodilution was performed by phlebotomy and infusions of low-molecular weight (MW) dextran in one group and of lactated Ringer's solution in the other group. The animals were sacrificed 1 week after temporary arterial occlusion. Hemodilution reduced the hematocrit to a level of 33% to 34%, which lasted throughout the week in both groups. After hemodilution there was a very significant reduction in blood viscosity, plasma total protein content, and fibrinogen levels in both groups in the acute stage; these levels gradually returned to baseline by the end of the week. In the group with lactated Ringer's solution hemodilution, both osmotic and oncotic pressures were decreased by hemodilution in the acute stage. In the control and low-MW dextran groups, osmotic and oncotic pressure remained unaltered throughout the week. Hemodilution resulted in a slight decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in all groups in the acute stage, but there were no significant changes in central venous, pulmonary arterial, or pulmonary wedge pressures. During the week of study, there were no differences in the cardiac index and total blood volume between the groups, and no significant changes in hematological parameters with the exception of a slight increase in bleeding time immediately after hemodilution with low-MW dextran. Daily neurological assessment showed consistently poorer condition during the first 5 days in the group with lactated Ringer's solution compared to either the control group or the group receiving low-MW dextran. Based on Mann-Whitney U-testing, the infarct volume of the lactated Ringer's solution recipients, expressed as a percentage of the total volume of that hemisphere (median 15.7%, range 6.6% to 25.2%) was significantly larger than that of the group receiving low-MW dextran (median 2.2%, range 0% to 15.8%) and that of the control group (median 11.9%, range 0% to 39.9%). The results indicate that, in this model, hemodilution with colloids was beneficial, whereas hemodilution with crystalloids was deleterious. It is likely that the decrease in oncotic pressure observed after hemodilution with lactated Ringer's solution is one of the most important reasons for its detrimental effect.\r"

Effects were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (with and without gadolinium enhancement), leakage of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), electron microscopy, and light microscopy. Significant histological damage was seen at radiation doses above 295 Gy, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was observed only in tissue receiving a dose of 165 Gy or greater. Blood-brain barrier breakdown increased up to the 6-month time point, and thereafter appeared to stabilize or decrease. The area of blood-brain barrier disruption indicated by gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging was greater than that indicated by leakage of HRP.\r"

  ".W": "The protein kinase-C (PKC) second messenger system contributes to regulation of cell growth and differentiation. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of modulators of the PKC enzyme system on the state of differentiation and proliferation rates of human gliomas in vitro. The administration of the PKC-activating phorbol esters 4-beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a dose-related inhibition of growth of human glioma cell lines in vitro as measured by 3H-thymidine uptake. The synthetic nonphorbol PKC activator (SC-9) produced an even more pronounced decrease of 3H-thymidine uptake. Diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of the system, applied externally, transiently decreased the proliferation, in concordance with its short-lived existence in vivo. Conversely, the administration of 4-alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (alpha-PDD), a phorbol ester that binds but does not activate the enzyme, had no effect on the proliferation rate. At the dosages that maximally decreased proliferation, there was no evidence of direct glioma cell lysis induced by these agents as measured by a chromium-release assay. Immunocytochemical analysis and cytofluorometric measurement of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in the treated cultures revealed an increase in GFAP staining over control cultures. In contrast to the response of glioma cells, nonmalignant human adult astrocytes treated with the PKC activators responded by increasing their proliferation rate. The authors postulate that the diametrically opposed effects of PKC activators on nonmalignant astrocytes versus glioma growth may be due to a high intrinsic PKC activity in glioma cells, with resultant down-regulation of enzyme activity following the administration of the pharmacological activators.\r"

  ".U": "90376183\r", 
  ".W": "The 1.9-mu wavelength component of a 1.9/1.06-mu two-wavelength laser with near-continuous wave properties was tested for its potential use in neurosurgery. The 1.9-mu wavelength has tissue-ablative capabilities, while the 1.06-mu wavelength (Nd:YAG) is suitable for achieving hemostasis. The advantages of the 1.9-mu wavelength over the CO2 laser include its ability to transmit through silica fiberoptic delivery systems and its deeper penetration in water (approximately 100 mu, a depth 10 times greater than for the CO2 laser), which is compatible with irrigation during ablation. To test the effectiveness of the laser, bilateral craniotomies were performed in anesthetized rats immobilized in a stereotactic frame. Under an operating microscope, lesions were made on the cortex by delivering the 1.9-mu laser beam through a 400-mu fiber at an average power of 1 W over a range of fluences. Subjective intraoperative observations were notable for minimal bleeding, absence of charring when the tissue was irrigated with a thin stream of saline, and uniform lesion formation. For comparison, lesions were generated with a commercially available continuous-wave CO2 laser at equivalent power and fluences. Histological specimens were divided into three groups based on the study after laser application: acute (30 minutes), subacute (48 hours), and chronic (14 days). The extent of thermal injury for the 1.9-mu laser in the acute lesions was quantitatively and histologically similar to that generated by the CO2 laser. Regions of injury extended approximately from the apex of the lesion, and crater depths generated by both lasers were similar (250 to 750 mu) in the range of fluences investigated (1.25 to 10 kJ/sq cm). Subacute and chronic histological specimens demonstrated inflammatory and repair responses that correlated with the acute injury regions in both the 1.9-mu and CO2 laser-treated specimens. This study demonstrates a neurosurgical potential for a new two-wavelength laser that ablates tissue effectively with limited thermal injury. The 1.9-mu laser is comparable to the widely used CO2 laser but offers several unique advantages, including the ability for delivery through a fiberoptic system and to irrigate tissue during use.\r"

The lesion was a 3-cm arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that had produced a generalized seizure in an otherwise asymptomatic young woman. A first, resting H2(15)O PET scan identified the AVM. A second PET scan, performed during vibrotactile stimulation of the contralateral hand, identified the somatosensory area of the hand region and localized the AVM to that part of the precentral gyrus immediately in front of it. This relationship and localization were confirmed by cortical mapping at the time of craniotomy under local anesthesia. Functional PET scanning may prove to be useful to localize cortical lesions precisely and to help in determining preoperatively the best form of treatment for lesions, especially AVM's, in functionally important cortex.\r"

Increasing N intake to 21.4 g/d significantly increased urinary orotic acid excretion to 747 +/- 46 micrograms/d. Glucose infusion (300 g/d) significantly decreased orotic acid excretion when N intake was 10.4 g/d, whereas arginine infusion (2.3 g/d) did not alter the excretion of orotic acid under these conditions. When arginine was infused at higher N intake (21.4 g/d), orotic acid excretion decreased from 822 +/- 74 to 624 +/- 46 micrograms/d. It is concluded that increasing N intake is accompanied by an enhanced urinary excretion of orotic acid. This excretion of orotic acid is significantly modified by glucose or arginine.\r"

Tissue protein mass was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher for mammary gland and liver but lower for carcass in lactating animals. The plasma methionine flux was higher during lactation (8.5 vs. 5.1 g/d). The fractional synthesis rates of tissue proteins (Ksp: %/d) were lower during lactation for some muscles, especially the masseter muscle (1.46 vs. 2.15), and for skin (0.59 vs. 1.22) and the pooled head plus feet fraction (1.64 vs. 2.31), but the rates were greatly increased in mammary gland (42 vs. 3). The non-mammary methionine flux (plasma flux minus the flux corresponding to milk methionine output and methionine utilization for mammary protein synthesis) was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower for the lactating goats than for the dry group (93 vs. 131 mg.d-1.kg empty body weight-1). This is in agreement with the lower rates of protein synthesis in carcass (542 vs. 948 mg.d-1.kg empty body weight-1) and skin (93 vs. 189) for lactating compared to dry goats. It can be inferred from these data that in early lactation, when nutrient requirements of animals are not adequately met, an adaptative mechanism occurs that allows amino acids to be available for the mammary gland by a decrease of their utilization in some extramammary tissues.\r"

Pregnant dams were fed one of two lipid-based, carbohydrate-restricted experimental diets. In experiment 1, the primary energy source was soybean oil; the diets contained no added glucose but contained 4% glucose-equivalents as lipid-glycerol. In experiment 2, the major lipid component was food-grade oleic acid; this diet was supplemented with 4% glucose. A crossover design was used. For gd 0-19, dams were fed either the high carbohydrate diet (62% glucose) or one of the carbohydrate-restricted diets (4% glucose or 4% lipid-glycerol); beginning on gd 19 and through neonatal d 7 (nd 7), the opposite diet was fed. For controls in each experiment, a high carbohydrate diet (62% glucose) and the respective carbohydrate-restricted diets were fed throughout pregnancy. The results showed that restriction to 4% glucose equivalents beginning on gd 20 resulted in high first-day neonatal mortality that was comparable in magnitude to nd-1 mortality rates in dams fed the carbohydrate-restricted diets throughout pregnancy. Repletion with the high carbohydrate, control diet after gd 19 significantly reduced mortality. These experiments demonstrate that maternal dietary carbohydrate beginning in late gestation is essential for the postnatal survival of rat pups.\r"

Pregnant control dams fed a 62% glucose diet were paired at parturition with experimental dams fed diets with either severe (0% glucose) or moderate (6% glucose) carbohydrate restriction. At birth half of the littermates of each pair were cross-fostered so that each dam nursed a litter consisting of one-half deficient and one-half control pups. All pups born to dams fed the 0% glucose diet died within 24 h of birth whether they were nursed by control or deficient dams. Control pups cross-fostered to these deficient dams died by the second day; the 0% glucose diet failed to support milk production. In contrast, the dams fed the 6% glucose diet produced milk, but its composition was significantly lower in carbohydrate and lipid than was milk of control dams. This altered milk composition was associated with retarded postnatal growth and development. Control pups cross-fostered to 6% glucose dams showed decreased survival (83% vs. 97%) and significantly reduced body weight (10 g vs. 12 g) at d 7. Conversely, 6% glucose pups cross-fostered to control dams showed improved survival (54% vs. 29%) and significantly increased body weight (9 g vs. 7 g) at d 7. These data showed that carbohydrate-restricted diets altered milk production and/or composition, which, in turn, reduced growth and increased mortality in the pups nursed by dams fed these diets. The results demonstrate that an adequate source of dietary carbohydrate is important for optimal lactational performance.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to examine the effects of a combination of several dietary fibers (5% guar gum, 5% apple pectin, 15% wheat bran, 22% soybean fiber) and crude potato starch (23%) on plasma lipids and lipoproteins and on liver lipid concentration in rats fed a diet containing either 15% lard or 5% oil with or without dietary cholesterol/cholic acid. Male Wistar rats ate the test diets for 3 wk. The incorporation of fiber and crude potato starch into the diet resulted in a significant enlargement of the cecum; it also increased the concentration of volatile fatty acids and the pool of acetate, propionate and butyrate. Feeding this fermentable carbohydrate decreased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in rats given a low fat diet and prevented the expected rise in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in rats fed cholesterol/cholic acid or lard. Further studies of high density lipoprotein (HDL) composition, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) activity and 125I-labeled human low density lipoprotein (LDL) turnover were done in the group fed the low fat diet without added cholesterol/cholic acid. The study of the HDL fraction in rats fed a diet rich in fermentable carbohydrates demonstrated a decrease in the HDL1 subpopulation and in the proportion of apolipoprotein E. Plasma clearance of intravenously injected 125I-labeled LDL was faster in rats fed this diet than in rats fed the fiber-free diet. In the liver, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were depressed whereas the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The chicks received ultraviolet radiation from fluorescent lights in addition to 1100 ICU/kg (27.5 micrograms/kg) of D3 in the basal diet. Supplementation of the diet with 10 micrograms/kg of all the metabolites except 24R,25-(OH)2D3 significantly lowered the incidence and severity of tibial dyschondroplasia and increased bone ash when compared to birds receiving the basal diet. None of the active D3 metabolites was effective when fed at 0.1 or 1.0 micrograms/kg of diet.

The original observation was made in rats fed a low zinc diet based on soy protein. The present study was designed to test the effect of feeding a low zinc, egg white-based diet on bleeding time and platelet aggregation. The reversibility of the defect and the response of washed platelets from rats fed low zinc (less than 1 mg/kg) and control (100 mg/kg) diets were also assessed. Immature male rats were fed the respective diets for 11 d, the controls being both ad libitum- and pair-fed. To test reversibility, rats depleted for 11 d were then fed the control diet for an additional 7 d. Saline bleeding time was increased, and aggregation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from rats of low zinc status was impaired. The rate of the secondary phase of aggregation was significantly less than that of controls, but it was not different from that of controls after 7 d of zinc repletion. Aggregation of washed platelets was also impaired by low zinc status, showing that the defect is associated with the platelet, not the plasma. Egg white as a source of protein in the low zinc diet resulted in abnormal hemostasis and platelet aggregation, including a defective response of washed platelets.\r"

If chronic ethanol administration during pregnancy decreases the availability of sulfur amino acids or Zn, this deficiency could contribute to growth retardation of the fetuses, one of the features of fetal alcohol syndrome. The purpose of this study was to discern whether chronic ethanol administration to pregnant rats alters glutathione (GSH), MT or Zn content of selected tissues of the dams and fetuses. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed from gestational days 5 to 19 either the control diet ad libitum (AF), the ethanol diet ad libitum (EF) or the control diet using the pair-feeding technique (PF). On the 19th day of gestation, total hepatic GSH was significantly lower for the EF and PF dams than for the AF dams. Hepatic MT contents were similar for the AF and EF dams, and hepatic MT content was significantly greater for the PF dams than the AF and EF dams. The three groups did not differ regarding hepatic Zn content of dams or fetuses. In summary, on the 19th day of gestation, chronic ethanol feeding of pregnant rats did not lower the maternal hepatic GSH level below that of PF dams, did not induce hepatic MT in the dams and did not prevent fetuses from achieving body weights and hepatic Zn concentrations equal to those of controls.\r"

The numbers of splenocytes and AM obtained from male F344 rats fed high vitamin E diets significantly increased at 10 d after the onset of the experiment. Splenic lymphocytes' responses to concanavalin A and natural killer cell activity also increased with increasing contents of vitamin E in the diets. Furthermore, the ability of AM to phagocytose opsonized sheep red blood cells increased with increasing contents of vitamin E in diets and showed a fivefold increase in rats fed the diet with the highest vitamin E content (2500 mg/kg diet) compared with rats in the control group. The lavage fluid of lungs from rats fed a high vitamin E diet (500 mg/kg diet) increased phagocytic activity of AM from rats fed a basal diet; it also induced a 72% increase in activity compared to that in control rats. The phagocytic activity of AM was not enhanced when the large molecules (MW greater than 10,000) were removed by ultrafiltration from the lavage fluid of lungs of rats fed the high vitamin E diet (500 mg/kg diet). These data suggest that there is macrophage-activating factor-like material in the lavage fluid of lungs of rats fed high vitamin E diets and that high vitamin E diets may activate not only splenic lymphocytes but also AM.\r"

Peroxidized methyl linoleate was added to the luminal side, and the appearance of thiobarbituric acid-reactive (TBA-reactive) material on the contraluminal side was measured. Incubation with N,N,bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU) under conditions in which it inhibits the glutathione disulfide reductase/glutathione peroxidase system increased the appearance of TBA-reactive material, indicating that at least a portion of the TBA-reactive material passing through the epithelium is peroxide in nature. Adding glutathione (GSH) to the luminal side substantially decreased the appearance of TBA-reactive material on the contraluminal side, either without or with BCNU treatment. Inhibition of GSH transport and control experiments with GSH, peroxidized methyl linoleate and purified brush border membranes showed that this decrease was due primarily to uptake of luminal GSH and its use to support intracellular GSH-dependent reactions. Thus, the results indicate that exogenous GSH, which can exist in certain diets, can be taken up by the small intestine and used to protect against absorption of lipid peroxidation products.\r"

The control group was fed a diet containing 57% sucrose and 2% corn oil as a fixed carbohydrate reference; the three experimental groups received diets containing 57% sucrose and 2% corn oil plus 13% fat in the form of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) or long-chain triglycerides (LCT) (either lard as a highly saturated fat or corn oil as a highly unsaturated fat). Feeding LCT compared to the control diet, decreased sucrase activity in mucosal brush borders of the duodenum and jejunum. In these segments of MCT-fed rats, sucrase activity was similar to that in the control animals. In another experiment, measuring immunoreactive sucrase-isomaltase in jejunal brush border membranes revealed that feeding a high corn oil diet, but not a high MCT diet, led to a reduction in the sucrase catalytic activity per unit weight of enzyme protein, suggesting that the degradation status of sucrase-isomaltase might be altered by the different types of dietary fats. With MCT feeding, jejunal alkaline phosphatase activity was enhanced to a large extent compared to the activity in other groups. Feeding MCT, compared to lard or corn oil, also increased microvillus phospholipids of the jejunal mucosa. These results suggest that MCT, unlike LCT, do not suppress the activity of mucosal microvillus membrane enzymes in rat small intestine.\r"

HMF bound conjugated bile salts in vitro and significantly increased fecal excretion of both neutral and acidic steroids by 65-95% and 80-170% more, respectively (p less than 0.05), than did the intact protein. Extraction of HMF with methanol slightly decreased the activity, but the methanol-soluble fraction was not regarded as a principal determinant. Soybean saponin at the dietary level equivalent to that contained in HMF did not effectively lower serum cholesterol. The activity was not necessarily duplicated even when methanol-treated fractions were recombined. Further degradation of the methanol-extracted HMF by various proteases resulted in loss of activity. HMF obtained after pepsin digestion exerted a potential similar to that of HMF prepared after digestion by microbial proteases.\r"

Total phospholipids and phosphatidylcholine of erythrocyte ghosts obtained from olive oil-fed animals, as compared to those fed corn oil, showed an increase in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the (n-6) and (n-3) series and a decrease in saturated fatty acids.

Conversely, rats fed a mixture of MCT and corn oil, as compared to those fed exclusively corn oil, showed increase in long-chain PUFA of the (n-6) and (n-3) series, with no changes in saturated fatty acid levels. The cholesterol/phosphorus molar ratio showed only a slight increase with MCT supplementation. Olive oil feeding induced important changes in fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids as compared to corn oil feeding without modifying the cholesterol/phosphorus ratio and MCT feeding slightly affected red blood cell membrane lipid composition.\r"

  ".W": "At Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, 270 consecutive patients at the dermatology and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic were enrolled in a study to evaluate the association of clinical STD syndromes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Female patients became sexually active earlier than male patients and were younger at marriage. Persons with a history of an STD during the preceding 5 years were more likely to be HIV infected (43%) than those without such a history (26%; OR 2.08, 95% C.I. 1.17, 3.73). Examination at the time of the visit demonstrated an association between genital ulcers and HIV infection in male and female patients (OR 2.21, 95% C.I. 1.08, 4.53, and OR 8.54, 95% C.I. 1.45, 87.55, respectively) but no association between HIV and urethritis or vaginal discharge. The etiologic fraction for HIV infection of genital ulcers was 0.218. Men with a history of contact with prostitutes were more likely to be HIV infected than those without contact (50% versus 28%, p less than 0.05), but once controlled for STDs, this relationship was no longer significant. This study confirms other studies from East Africa that have shown a relationship between genital ulcers and HIV infection. This finding, in the presence of no association between other STD syndromes and HIV infection, suggests that genital ulcers may be truly associated with HIV infection rather than a marker of high-risk activities.\r"

The association was strongest among persons at least 60 years of age. In order to evaluate this finding further, we evaluated the response to both PPD and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in an elderly population. Fifty-six consecutive hospitalized patients with nonimmunosuppressive diseases were examined. None had a history of tuberculosis nor evidence of the known HTLV-I-associated diseases. The subjects' ages ranged from 62-93 years (median = 75 years); 43 were women and 13 were men. Twenty-two of the subjects were HTLV-I antibody positive. Among the carriers, there was an increased level of nonreactivity to PPD, the relative risk adjusted for age (RR) being 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-5.8), as well as to PHA of RR = 2.3 (0.60-9.0). When subjects were cross-classified for response to both skin tests, 15 of 17 carriers were nonreactive to either or both antigens compared to 15 of 25 noncarriers [RR = 5.1 (0.99-25.9) (p value, one-sided = 0.026)]. The decline in reactivity to both antigens increased with age, but was consistently lower among the carriers. Among subjects with positive reactions to PPD, the degree of reaction as measured by the size of erythema was reduced among the carriers; however, for PHA responders, the response in carriers appeared to be normal. Among the HTLV-I antibody negative subjects, the size of erythema for both antigens was strongly correlated (p = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We performed prospective and retrospective studies of 96 consecutive patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) to determine the incidence, pathogenesis, and clinical significance of hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium levels less than or equal to 130 mmol/L on more than one occasion. Thirty (31.3%), six with ARC and 24 with AIDS, had hyponatremia, and it developed in 20 as outpatients. Age, gender, duration of illness, and weight loss did not differ between groups. The hyponatremic patient had more opportunistic illnesses, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and cytomegalovirus infections, and had a mortality of 70% as compared to 36.4% of the patients without hyponatremia. The probability of 50% survival after diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the hyponatremic group was 11.5 months, as compared to 39 months for those without hyponatremia, p less than 0.001. The probability of 50% survival after development of hyponatremia was 4.5 months and the median length of time to development of hyponatremia was 12.5 months after diagnosis of HIV infection. Eighty-eight percent had hypovolemia and 12% normovolemia. Seventeen of 21 with hypovolemia had no evident source of fluid loss. Two had Addison's disease, and 15 had unexpectedly high urine sodium concentration without evidence of renal or adrenal insufficiency. Hyponatremia occurs commonly in ambulatory patients with ARC or AIDS, appears in patients with higher mortality and morbidity, and does not represent a terminal event. Most patients had hypovolemia and unexpectedly high urine sodium concentration, suggesting defective renal sodium conservation.\r"

Before testing this hypothesis, however, it is necessary to determine the transplacental transfer, fetal toxicity, and fetal accumulation of ZDV (if any) in a representative animal model. Therefore, the transplacental transfer and the fetal accumulation of ZDV were determined at steady state in near-term pregnant macaques (Macaca nemestrina). ZDV was administered to five dams at a rate predicted to produce a steady-state plasma concentration of about 1 microgram/ml. When steady state was predicted to have been achieved, a cesarean section was performed on each dam. At this time, blood samples from the dam (peripheral vein) and the fetus (umbilical vein) were obtained simultaneously. The plasma concentration of ZDV and its major metabolite, zidovudine glucuronide (ZDVG), were determined by a specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The ratio of steady-state plasma concentration (Crss) of ZDV in the fetus (Cssf) to that in the dam (Cssd) (Crss = Cssf/Cssd) was found to be close to unity (0.826 +/- 0.067). Similar results were obtained for the ratio of steady-state unbound ZDV plasma concentration (0.852 +/- 0.083). We conclude that ZDV readily crosses the placenta, probably by passive diffusion, and that ZDV does not accumulate in the fetus when administered to near-term pregnant macaques.\r"

Both mechanisms are shown in detail in a time-interval series of electron micrographs. The two lipid bilayers of the viral envelope and of the cellular membrane usually fuse seamlessly within 1-3 min at 37 degrees C, but occasionally membrane ruptures occur, leading to rapid cytopathic effects, i.e., vacuolization and cytolysis only a few minutes later. In the course of virus-cell fusion, gp 120 is integrated into the cell membrane; subsequent syncytia formation was observed after 1 h of incubation. The core disintegrates and releases the viral ribonucleoprotein through the opening at the fusion site into the cytoplasm.\r"

Although all Swedish samples were positive by PCR, the reactivity was more pronounced in samples from late stages than in those from early stages of infection. Six of nine Ethiopian samples from HIV-1-seropositive patients were positive by PCR, but the reactions were much weaker than those observed for Swedish samples, and in most cases seen with one primer pair only. These results suggest that the burden of HIV-1 DNA in peripheral mononuclear blood cells increases with advancing disease. PCR using primer pairs designed to detect HIV-1 infection in Europe and North America is not always suitable for the detection of HIV-1 infection in Ethiopia. The differences in PCR reactivity could possibly be a consequence of differences regarding host responses to the virus in the two countries, but more likely due to genomic differences between HIV-1 strains prevalent in Ethiopia and Sweden.\r"

Barrier precautions were fully adhered to 44.0% of the time. During interventions in patients with profuse bleeding, adherence was only 19.5% in contrast to 44.7% for those who were not bleeding. Adherence was 56.4% during minor interventions but only 16.7% during major procedures. Adherence rates varied among health care providers: residents, 58%; emergency staff physicians, 38%; consultant physicians, 43%; emergency nursing staff, 44%; paramedics, 8%; radiology technicians, 14%; and housekeeping, 91%. In a follow up questionnaire that ascertained reasons for lack of compliance, 47% of providers indicated that there was not always sufficient time to put on protective material, 33% felt that precautions interfered with skillful performance of procedures, and 23% stated that materials were uncomfortable. Only 2.7% felt that Universal Precautions did not work. Since there is no proven postexposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus, Universal Precautions must be rigorously followed until such time as they are shown not to be effective or an alternate approach is developed. Strategies to improve compliance and improvements in barrier technology need to be developed.\r"

Male relatives and friends of male AIDS patients had a seroprevalence rate of 19% and also had a history of multiple heterosexual partners and frequent contact with prostitutes. The HIV seroprevalence rate among unrelated groups of Haitian adults ranged from 2% in rural healthy adults to 22% among tuberculosis patients to a high of 49% among Haitian prostitutes. This seroprevalence pattern suggests that HIV infection is widespread in Haiti and that heterosexual activity plays a major role in transmission.\r"

Lack of a specimen for verification combined with a limited description by an untrained lay person hinders confident identification of the plant. In view of these problems a computer identification system has been developed for use in answering poison control calls. A database has been compiled for 103 common houseplants described in lay terms, with respect to 56 features each possessing a number of possible states. The database is used with the MS-DOS polyclave program ONLIN6. Identifications are made by entering data for available features, so as to eliminate taxa until a single taxon remains. This system has been used in 112 mock calls in which the resulting identification could be checked. These trials resulted in correct identifications 65% of the time. Errors were attributed primarily to problems related to translation of character states into lay terminology. Revision of the database is planned that will eliminate these problems. Use of the system by hospital personnel is recommended only after graphics screens have been added to the database, and where staff have been specially trained in botanical terminology and in use of the ONLIN6 program.\r"

Because of the lack of adequate information regarding the toxic qualities of S. dulcamara berries, the ingestion of even small quantities by children is usually treated conservatively with syrup of ipecac. The toxicity of S. dulcamara berries was studied by gavaging mice with a preparation of lyophilized berries, ripened and unripened, collected at various times of the year. Mice receiving unripened fruit from early in the season had gastrointestinal tissue changes consistent with solanine toxicity. Animals dosed with unripened fruit from the latter part of the year showed behavioral signs suggestive of solanine toxicity, however gastrointestinal lesions were not observed. In no case did the ripened fruit produce behavioral or histologic toxicity. Aggressive treatment of children ingesting limited amounts of ripened S. dulcamara berries appears to be unnecessary.\r"

The results included a minimum of 810 poisoning incidents in these households in the previous year, giving an annual incidence of poisoning in this population of 108 per 1,000. This rate is considerably higher than previous estimates. Other results included a trend toward delaying poisoning therapy until symptoms developed or taking the poisoned patient directly to an emergency department. If these results are confirmed by conventional polling, poisoning is a major public health problem. Furthermore, confirmation would establish automated telephone polling as a valuable tool for rapidly and inexpensively surveying large populations.\r"

The patients were compared to healthy subjects and to chronic alcoholics seen during post-alcohol withdrawal. Auditory and visual evoked potentials were almost normal but somatosensory evoked potentials showed a slight decrease of peripheral conduction velocities and an increase of central conduction times more marked in the solvent exposed workers who were also alcoholics. The late \"cognitive\" components reflecting attention processes (N2 and P3) were normal. Solvent-exposed workers and alcoholics were both characterized by some difficulty in modulating their attentional resources according to task demands, as reflected by a tendency to responses (N1, N2 and P3) of similar amplitudes whether the stimulus was or was not the target. These findings support the presence, in solvent exposed workers, of minor dysfunction of the nervous system at both peripheral and cortical levels potentiated by alcohol as well as of mild cognitive impairments concerning attention processes.\r"

Sinus bradycardia and, in some cases, AV-arrhythmia occurred in the ECG. The additional infusion with cysteine attenuated the cardiovascular failure and more than doubled the survival time of formalin-infused rats. Infusion of N-acetylcysteine or correction of formalin-induced metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate, on the other hand, did not exert antidotal activity. On isolated rat atria in vitro, formalin decreased the rate and the contractility and cysteine antagonized these effects of formalin. In conclusion, the severe and often lethal incidents observed following the therapeutic administration of formalin are due to the cardiovascular-depressive activity of formaldehyde and may be antagonized by cysteine.\r"

These animals ingest significant amounts of marijuana, which after absorption is metabolized into a number of psychoactive agents which are ultimately excreted through the urine and milk. This potentially contaminated milk is used by the people of the region. Depending upon the amount of milk ingested and the degree of contamination, the milk could result in a low to moderate level of chronic exposure to Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other metabolites especially among the children raised on this milk. This research was conducted to investigate the extent of passive consumption of marijuana by the consumers of potentially contaminated milk. Urine and milk specimens were obtained from buffalo and were analyzed for 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH) which is a major metabolite for THC. The analysis was done by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was observed that during the months of June and July, 60 percent of the buffalo contained detectable levels of THC-COOH in their urine and 50 percent of these animals produced milk which was contaminated with THC or other metabolites. Analysis of the urine obtained from children with ages ranging from six months to 3 years, who were being raised on the milk from these animals, indicated that 29 percent of them had low levels of THC-COOH in their urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postoperative investigations included patency tests, necropsy and light microscopy. Use of the laser systems did not reduce operation time. The highest rate of postoperative strictures (90%), urethral fistulas (30%), urinomas (20%) and postoperative deaths (70%) was seen in the Neodymium-YAG laser group. CO2 laser repair was almost as efficacious as microsuture repair, except for a higher rate of urethral fistulas resulting from the initially weak laser weld. Based on these findings, the Neodymium-YAG laser seems unsuitable for urethral repair. Further studies in larger animals are warranted using a CO2 laser in combination with postoperative cystostomy for urinary diversion in order to avoid fistulas in the early postoperative period.\r"

Single agent post treatment tumor volume growth ratio [TGR] values of DP, MTX and CDDP were 97%, 65% and 49% of control. While the MTX/DP combination produced only mild cytotoxic enhancement, CDDP/DP and CDDP/MTX/DP reduced TGR to 20% and 17%, respectively. A second multi-dose evaluation of CDDP/DP using human testicular carcinoma in this model also showed a CDDP dose-dependent response with achievable complete tumor regression. Host toxicity was not substantially increased by DP. DP would appear to be effective in vivo as a chemosensitizer of CDDP; it may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of CDDP in a variety of tumors.\r"

Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on each soluble matrix protein sample resulting in a characteristic \"map\" of spots for each stone. The soluble matrix protein \"map\" was complex yet reproducible for each sample studied. The soluble matrix protein maps resembled urinary protein maps and stones of different crystalline content had significantly different matrix protein maps. The two-dimensional electrophoretic maps of matrix proteins extracted from calcium oxalate and uric acid calculi were similar to previously published two-dimensional electrophoretic maps of urinary proteins recovered from calcium oxalate and uric acid crystals. The majority of the protein maps were noteworthy for the presence of a low molecular weight pattern (MW less than 17,500 dalton) not seen in association with normal urinary protein maps. The significance of this pattern is not known but could be the result of degradation of larger proteins, evidence of renal tubular disease, or evidence of selective incorporation of low molecular weight proteins during stone formation.\r"

Human CC strips were set in a tissue bath and isometric tension changes were recorded. All strips showed spontaneous contractions and produced tonic contractions by both high potassium solution and noradrenaline (NA) (10(-9) to 10(-4) M) in a dose dependent manner. In preparations precontracted with NA, relaxation was produced by bradykinin (10(-7) to 2 x 10(-6) M). Strips lacking endothelium were contracted by NA but no relaxation was observed with the addition of bradykinin. More direct evidence of the release of EDRF from human CC was demonstrated by a \"sandwich\" mount. We conclude that bradykinin relaxes human CC by releasing EDRF and that this EDRF may be a factor in erectile function.\r"

Testicular blood flow and temperature were significantly increased bilaterally 30 days after surgery to induce unilateral varicocele, and this was the case in both the younger and older animals. It has not previously been known that the pathophysiological effects of ELV extended to the peripubertal testis. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the left testis is not necessary for the right testicular response to varicocele. In the present paper, animals were subjected to left orchiectomy simultaneously with the surgery to induce ELV. Thirty days later, the animals were divided into those with and those without the left spermatic vein varicosity. Testicular blood flow was determined in all these animals as well as in a separate group of control and experimental varicocele animals. The group of ELV animals with left spermatic varicosity demonstrated a significant increase in contralateral testicular blood flow while the ELV group without left spermatic varicosity did not. We speculate that left venous distention is involved in the mechanism for the contralateral response to unilateral varicocele.\r"

Concomitant vesicostomy prevented a decrease in the urethral pressure profile measured three months post-rhizotomy. Sympathetic influences on basal urethral perfusion pressure were the same in neurally-intact and chronic rhizotomised cats. A significant prazosin-sensitive component of basal urethral perfusion pressure remained after section of all extrinsic urethral innervation in both neurally-intact and chronic cats. Local intra-arterial 6-hydroxydopamine also abolished this component. After rhizotomy, noradrenaline content in the proximal urethra was significantly increased but there was no change in sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation. A small (5% of control) atropine-sensitive and prazosin-resistant constriction was seen only after chronic sacral rhizotomy. We conclude that a mechanical factor associated with bladder expression and not an alteration in sympathetic control is the major factor leading to diminished proximal urethral closure after vesicourethral lower motor neuron lesion. Furthermore, short adrenergic neurons have an important role in the maintenance of urethral pressure in the normal state and after lower motor neuron lesion.\r"

[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate bound to membranes of human corpus cavernosum and endothelial cells with high affinity and limited capacity. Analysis of the binding data by Scatchard plot revealed the presence of one class of binding sites. The ligand binding specificity was determined by competitive binding assay. The data obtained show that [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was displaced by unlabeled competitors in the following order of efficacy in both membrane preparations: quinuclidinyl benzilate greater than scopolamine greater than atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide, M3 antagonist greater than pirenzepine, M1 antagonist greater than oxotremorine greater than (4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)trimethylammonium chloride m-chlorocarbanilate, M1 agonist greater than carbachol greater than hexamethonium. Solubilization of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors from human corpus cavernosum and endothelial cells, with 1% digitonin and 0.02% cholate and subsequent analysis on sucrose density gradients, demonstrated the presence of a macromolecule specifically bound to [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate sedimenting at the 6.2 S region of the gradient. These results demonstrate the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human corpus cavernosum and in endothelial cells cultured from this tissue.\r"

The submucosa was found to have a distinct organizational pattern. Collagen fibers are bound into fascicles with arborizing intercollagenous channels. These channels form an intricate network throughout the submucosa. With age, the fascicles separate into individual fibers and there is a commensurate widening of the intercollagenous channels. This process is accelerated in obstruction. As aging occurs, the channels progressively fill with an electron-dense fine particulate matter of unknown origin. The collagen reorganization and accumulation of extracellular matrix particles is thought to alter the permeability and compliance of the submucosa and to encroach upon the neurovascular bundle. A baseline set of morphologic criteria describing the natural history of the continent aged bladder is offered as a framework for future group identification in the incontinent patient.\r"

Hypertension, renal artery anomalies and donor indecision were the most common reasons for donor rejection. Recipient health and/or death, or a positive crossmatch after pre-transplant donor specific transfusion were other post-arteriogram reasons not to proceed with transplantation. Women were more likely to undergo nephrectomy than men, and older or heavier donors were more likely to be rejected. Using the transcostal, extrapleural surgical approach for nephrectomy there were no deaths or major complications, and the mean postoperative length of stay was 6.4 days. The average postoperative increase in serum creatinine was 0.33 mg./dl. with an average creatinine at discharge of the patient from the hospital of 1.2 mg./dl. The latter creatinine values varied concordantly with donor age. Only 56% of fully evaluated donors (91 of 159) actually underwent donor nephrectomy. The minimal morbidity sustained by these patients re-emphasizes the importance of careful donor selection.\r"

In cases of familial renal cell carcinoma identifying those persons at risk for renal tumors is difficult. There have been 28 family aggregates of renal carcinoma reported since 1961 but an abnormality in the constitutional karyotype has been demonstrated in the members of only 1 of these families. Since 1980 we have identified 5 more families in which a total of 12 relatives had renal cell carcinoma. However, peripheral blood karyotypes obtained from the 7 patients and 5 unaffected relatives whom we studied showed no significant abnormalities. With current laboratory techniques it is not possible to differentiate reliably familial renal tumors occurring by chance from those hereditary tumors posing a threat to remaining relatives. Therefore, in families with multiple cases of renal cell carcinoma we recommend that screening be conducted as has been suggested for families with von Hippel-Lindau's disease, with an initial renal ultrasound for family members at age 30 years and repeat examinations every 2 to 3 years.\r"

None of the 20 patients with a normal contralateral unit had progression. The local survival rate free of disease and cause-specific survival rate were not significantly different for the simple enucleation and partial nephrectomy groups. Even longer followup is needed to assess more clearly the definitive role of simple enucleation in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and the clinical relevance of possible positive margins in a patient population that usually is older.\r"

Additionally, grade 3 neoplasms occurred more often with invasive (stages T2 to T3) compared to superficial (stages TA, TIS and T1) tumors (p = 0.002). However, deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy was not significantly associated with tumor stage. Among the 49 patients treated by a definitive operation the median survival free of disease and median over-all survival were 33.7 and more than 120 months, respectively. Variables examined included deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy, tumor grade, tumor stage, primary tumor site and type of operation. In the univariate analysis deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy was the only significant predictor of survival free of disease (p = 0.04). Aneuploid tumors had a median survival free of disease of 19 versus 59 months for diploid tumors. However, in the multivariate analysis of factors affecting survival free of disease, the type of operation performed was the only significant variable. Patients undergoing nephroureterectomy with en bloc bladder cuff excision had a favorable survival free of disease (p = 0.04). Tumor stage was the only significant factor associated with over-all survival in univariate and multivariate analyses (p = 0.02 and 0.005, respectively). Patients with superficial tumors had a median survival of more than 120 versus 72 months for patients with invasive tumors. The data suggest that deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy may be a useful parameter to identify risk groups and plan the management of patients with primary transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.\r"

In this series 65 patients were followed for 6 to 46 months (average 17 months). Our reservoir allows the accommodation of a large volume of urine; urodynamic studies in 28 patients demonstrated a maximum reservoir capacity varying between 550 and 1,200 cc (average 747 cc). Maximal reservoir pressures ranged from 10 to 58 cm. water (average 35 cm. water). Of the 127 ureterocolonic reimplantations 4 ureters were initially reimplanted with a modified Le Duc procedure, 26 ureters were managed subsequently with the Goodwin transcolonic approach and 91 reimplantations were done with a direct (nontunneled) mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis. The overall success rates with each of the 3 techniques (absence of reflux and obstruction) were 75, 88.6 and 90.1%, respectively. Six megaureters underwent imbrication and direct reimplantation, and 3 of these (50%) became obstructed. Two converted ileal conduits were opened at the antimesenteric edge and were patched to the reservoir while the ureteroileal anastomosis was left undisturbed. One patient (1.5%) died of pulmonary embolism. Medical and surgical complications occurred only in the group who underwent simultaneous cystectomy and the over-all rate of complication was comparable to previous series with ileal conduits. The double row plication of the distal ileum and ileocecal valve allows for easy catheterization every 4 to 6 hours and 63 patients (97%) remain continent between catheterization. Four patients (6%) required reoperation for correction of incontinence or other complications. Our satisfactory experience with these patients makes this technique an excellent approach to achieving continent urinary diversion.\r"

  ".W": "From 1987 to 1988 we used cold biopsy forceps to remove completely 92 urothelial neoplasms ranging from 0.3 to 3 mm. Rigid biopsy forceps were used. The urologist usually treats these bladder neoplasms by diathermy coagulation, which obviously makes histological study impossible. On the other hand, due to the small size of these lesions even removal with the cutting loop inevitably causes deep regressive modifications that prevent accurate morphological evaluation. Histological examination of the neoplasms removed revealed the presence of low to medium grade (stage Ta, grades 1 to 2) noninfiltrating papillary carcinoma in 75 cases, high grade (stage Ta, grade 3) noninfiltrating papillary carcinoma in 9 and medium to high grade (stage T1, grades 2 to 3) infiltrating papillary carcinoma in 8, 1 of which had areas of squamous cell carcinoma. This method enabled us to study the morphology of the urothelial lesions in the initial phase. In our study population the number of high grade lesions and/or lesions with early signs of infiltration (17 of 92) appears to be noteworthy despite the small size of the tumors.\r"

Tumors were classified according to the deoxyribonucleic acid profile into diploid or aneuploid. Proliferation of the tumors was assessed from the proportions of S-phase cells. The flow cytometric data were correlated to the histopathological stage and grade. Grade 1 tumors could be subdivided into diploid and aneuploid in 60 and 40% of the cases, respectively, while 95% of the grade 2 and all grade 3 tumors were aneuploid. Diploid tumors had low proliferation rates, while aneuploid tumors had significantly higher values. A high frequency of muscle invasive diploid squamous cell tumors was noted. Tumor heterogeneity was studied by comparing cell material from superficial and deep tumor areas, which were in agreement in 77% of the cases. By comparing biopsy material with that obtained by bladder washings, biopsy material yielded better information regarding deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy in half of the aneuploid tumors. These results indicate that flow cytometry offers an additional objective method to characterize squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The deoxyribonucleic acid patterns in lymph node metastases in relation to the degree of ploidy and proliferation in the primary bladder tumor were evaluated in 162 patients who underwent cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder carcinoma. The 34 diploid tumors had given rise to lymph node metastases in only 2 cases (6%), whereas 34% of the aneuploid tumors had metastasized. The frequency of lymph node metastases increased with the proportions of S-phase cells. In transitional cell carcinoma all tumors with a proportion of S-phase cells exceeding 20% had metastasized, while tumors with a proportion of S-phase cells between 10 and 20%, and less than 10% had metastases in 50 and 33%, respectively. The degree of ploidy of aneuploid tumors seems to be of importance for the potential to give rise to metastases, since the majority of metastatic tumors were in the triploid-tetraploid and hyperdiploid but not hypertetraploid regions. The degree of ploidy of lymph node metastases was in good agreement with that of the primary tumors.\r"

A gamma camera with a pinhole collimator was used to monitor the radioactivity. Various penogram indexes were calculated from the time activity curve and their usefulness was evaluated. Index A1 was useful to differentiate vasculogenic and psychogenic importance. Indexes V1 and V2 were useful to differentiate arteriogenic and venogenic impotence. The radioisotope erection penogram is a simple, less invasive and valuable screening test in the identification of vasculogenic impotence, and is effective in differentiating arteriogenic and venogenic impotence.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, hyperthermia has been used for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The preliminary results reported were promising. However, apart from patients with total urinary retention, objective voiding parameters have not been reported in detail for patients with prostatism. In a phase II study we treated 30 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia by local microwave hyperthermia (915 MHz.). The prostate was heated transrectally to 42 to 43C, with the treatment consisting of 8 sessions of 60 minutes each given twice a week. To assess the results of treatment several parameters were determined before and 4 weeks after hyperthermia therapy, including transrectal ultrasound of the prostate with volumetry, urinary flow rate and residual volume. Of the patients 28 could be evaluated and only 2 showed a relevant improvement. Neither the voiding parameters nor the size of the prostate could be changed significantly by hyperthermia. The success rate of 7.1% is even lower than the spontaneous temporary regression rate of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus, we believe that hyperthermia cannot be regarded as an effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia comparable to transurethral resection.\r"

The evaluation involved physical examination including digital rectal examinations by 3 urologists, isotopic bone scans, computerized tomography scans of the abdomen and pelvis, cystoscopy, and random needle biopsies of the urethrovesical anastomotic area. In 6 patients metastatic disease to the bone and/or lymph nodes was found and local prostate cancer was discovered in 5. Among 57 patients without evidence of disease by the usual methods of evaluation needle biopsies of the anastomosis revealed local disease in 42%. No local disease was discovered in 30 post-radical prostatectomy patients with normal prostate specific antigen levels. There was a wide range of transrectally palpable contours after radical prostatectomy in patients with and without elevated prostate specific antigen levels. We conclude that prostate specific antigen but not digital rectal examination is an excellent early indicator of possible local recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Whether the prevalence of local disease after radical prostatectomy using prostate specific antigen levels and needle biopsies of the anastomosis is greater than heretofore has been appreciated will require further study.\r"

Among men who previously received adjuvant radiation therapy and had appropriately stored serum 15 had elevated prostate specific antigen levels after radical prostatectomy but before radiation therapy. After radiation therapy the prostate specific antigen level decreased by more than 50% in 80% and to female levels in 53% of the patients. We also prospectively treated 29 men who had increasing levels of prostate specific antigen 9 to 95 months after radical prostatectomy but who were otherwise without evidence of disease by the usual criteria. However, 19 of the patients had local disease as evidenced by random needle biopsy of the urethrovesical anastomosis. Complications of radiation therapy were minimal and maximal prostate specific antigen decrease occurred by 6 months after treatment. In 82% of the patients prostate specific antigen levels decreased by more than 50% and in 43% they decreased to female levels. Female levels were achieved after radiation therapy given many years postoperatively even in stage D1 cancer patients but some of the patients subsequently had increasing prostate specific antigen levels. These data suggest that local-regional disease may be the only site of disease persistence after radical prostatectomy in some of the patients who subsequently have distant metastasis. We conclude that radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy can cause elevated prostate specific antigen to decrease to undetectable levels in many patients but the durability and ultimate therapeutic value of this effect are unknown.\r"

Our patient presented with a nonfunctioning kidney due to ureteral obstruction and ultrasound demonstrated a severe decrease in renal parenchyma. Percutaneous access to the kidney was performed through the conventional manner and the remaining parenchyma was removed with biopsy and Lowsley forceps. Bleeding was minimum and a 22F nephrostomy Foley catheter was kept in place for 72 hours.

  ".U": "90376552\r", 
  ".W": "The Syme amputation is an old operation that has been used during this century primarily as a means of treating traumatic injuries to the forefoot in military patients. In 1984 we made a deliberate attempt to perform the operation in a highly selective group of dysvascular patients with forefoot necrosis who happened to have a palpable posterior tibial pulse. We reviewed the charts of 26 patients who underwent a one-stage (3 patients) or two-stage (23 patients) Syme amputation. The mean age was 60 years, (range 32 to 74 years). There were 17 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and 3 diet-controlled diabetic patients. Twenty-two patients (85%) had a palpable posterior tibial pulse before surgery. Fourteen patients (54%) underwent a preliminary Ray (4) or transmetatarsal (10) amputation to rid the forefoot of an active infection. Overall, 20 patients (77%) had successful Syme amputations. Nineteen of 22 patients (85%) with a palpable posterior tibial pulse had a successful amputation in contrast to one out of four patients (25%) who did not have a palpable pulse before surgery (p = 0.04). The mean follow-up of all patients was 23 months. The durability of the operation was demonstrated in finding that only one patient in 20 initially successful Syme amputations required revision to the below-knee level. The two-stage Syme amputation can be a very gratifying operation with success rates approaching 85%, even if offered to elderly diabetic patients. The single most important feature for success is to limit the operation to those patients with a palpable posterior tibial pulse before operation.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our article is to describe a patient with severe hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency, unstable angina, and a 6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. A previous aortogram had demonstrated severe bilateral renal artery stenoses. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe coronary disease. After cardiac catheterization acute renal failure and pulmonary edema requiring dialysis developed in the patient. In addition, evidence of impending myocardial necrosis developed. Because of the critical nature of the myocardial and renal ischemia it was necessary to perform combined myocardial and renal revascularization rather than staged procedures. At the time of coronary artery bypass grafting, a vein graft was anastomosed to the right coronary artery vein graft and tunneled through the diaphragm into the abdomen to revascularize both renal arteries. After surgery renal function gradually improved, and no further dialysis was required. The abdominal aortic aneurysm was repaired at a subsequent operation. At 2-year follow-up all grafts remained patent. The serum creatinine is 1.2 mg/dl. Although most patients with combined coronary artery disease and renal artery disease can be treated with staged operations, our procedure may be of value in patients in whom staged procedure are not feasible and in whom the infrarenal aorta is severely diseased or aneurysmal.\r"

Many animals in long-term experiments were fed \"regression\" diets and cholestyramine to lower cholesterol levels after lesions were established. No aneurysms were found in animals on normal diet. There were no aneurysms in 252 animals fed an atherogenic diet with or without regression for 12 months or less. However, aneurysms formed in 13% of cynomolgus monkeys (4 of 31) and 1% (1 of 107) rhesus monkeys on an atherogenic regimen for 16 to 24 months. Four of the five animals with aneurysms were on a regression diet and cholestyramine for 4 to 12 months. The fifth was fed the atherogenic diet for 20 months without subsequent regression. Aneurysms were prominent and involved the thoracic and abdominal aorta, innominate artery, carotid arteries, iliac and femoral arteries, and formed in areas most involved with plaque formation in both species. Histologic evidence was found of thinning of the media and atrophy with loss of normal architecture. The higher incidence of aneurysms in cynomolgus monkeys was associated with greater media destruction than was noted in the rhesus. These data support the thesis that aneurysm formation is a manifestation of atherosclerosis. In primate atherosclerosis, aneurysms form only after prolonged exposure to the atherogenic regimen, even in the presence of declining serum cholesterol levels. Matrix fibers in plaques may provide structural support to the aortic wall where there is underlying atrophy of the media. With time or declining serum cholesterol levels or both, plaques may atrophy leaving an aortic wall too thin to support increasing mural tension, leading to aneurysmal enlargement.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively reviewed the results of 108 consecutive femorocrural bypasses performed with prosthetic/autogenous composite graft material and compared these with the results of 57 crural bypasses using greater saphenous vein by the in situ technique. Indication for operation in all cases was the salvage of an otherwise imminently threatened limb. Polytetrafluoroethylene-composite grafts (n = 87) and human umbilical vein-composite grafts (n = 21) were placed only in patients lacking suitable autogenous material for in-line reconstruction. Patient groups were similar with respect to mean age, prevalence of arterial disease risk factors, quality of the distal runoff, and location of the distal anastomosis. Cumulative patency rates at 1 year by life-table analysis were 81.9%, 34.6%, and 12.1% for the in situ, polytetrafluoroethylene-composite and human umbilical vein-composite groups, respectively. At 2 years these were 63.9%, 29.9%, and 6.0%, respectively (p less than 0.025). Cumulative limb salvage at 1 year was 70.6%, 62.3%, and 32.7%, respectively. Wound-related complications occurred in 52.4% of human umbilical vein-composite, 38.6% of in situ, and 18.3% of polytetrafluoroethylene-composite bypasses (p less than 0.05). On the basis of these results, we conclude that femorocrural bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene-composite graft is an acceptable form of distal reconstruction for limb salvage in patients lacking sufficient lengths of autogenous vein. We no longer use human umbilical vein for composite construction.\r"

Patients were screened before operation with noninvasive studies documenting pulse examination, ankle pressure index, and toe blood pressures. Fifteen of 40 patients (38%) had no palpable pedal pulses. Three patients had vascular reconstruction before metatarsal head resection. Mean toe pressure of the entire group was 135 +/- 35 mm Hg (range, 60 to 190), with six patients having a pressure less than 100 mm Hg. All patients had primary healing of the plantar wound and secondary healing of the dorsal incision with no amputations or readmissions for forefoot sepsis in the mean follow-up of 38.5 months (range, 2 to 54 months). In seven patients with recurrent ulcers, no relationship was found between measured indexes of forefoot perfusion and recurrence. However, all patients with recurrence were noncompliant in returning for follow-up orthotic care. This technique provides a means to ensure rapid healing of severe mal perforans while decreasing hospitalization, wound care, and periods of immobilization and is applicable in diabetic patients with arterial insufficiency and toe pressure of at least 60 mm Hg.\r"

  ".W": "A 65-year-old woman sought treatment for sentinel upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Three years previously she had undergone graft replacement of her ascending aorta for aneurysm. In the interim she was followed for chronic dissection of her remaining aorta, and 6 months before this admission she had undergone graft replacement of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. Arteriography and CT scanning of the thorax revealed an 8 cm aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta. Operation was undertaken at which time an aortoesophageal fistula, as a result of erosion of the aneurysm into the esophagus, was identified. The descending thoracic aortic aneurysm was replaced with a Dacron tube graft, the esophageal defect was repaired primarily, and a viable pedicle flap of omentum was used to reinforce the esophageal repair and cover the aortic graft. Her postoperative recovery was free of infection but complicated by rapid expansion of the upper abdominal aorta at the visceral arterial level. Eight weeks after initial operation she underwent graft replacement of her remaining thoracoabdominal aorta with direct reattachment of her celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and both renal arteries. Recovery after her second procedure was uneventful, and she continues to do well at 13 months after operation. Development of a primary aortoesophageal fistula caused by aneurysms of the aorta is a rare but lethal complication. We present a technique for treatment of primary aortoesophageal fistula using omentum and preservation of gastrointestinal continuity as a one-stage operation. It is possible in selected cases to manage the esophageal perforation with primary closure and omental coverage to achieve healing free of infection without temporary or permanent discontinuity of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

We therefore evaluated arteriographically alternate inflow sites and measured the femoral/brachial pressure gradients before and after placement of 87 femorofemoral and 510 femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypasses. No prebypass femoral/brachial pressure gradients were present with and without intraarterial papaverine. However, femoral/branchial pressure gradients greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg were observed after the bypass placement in 16 femorofemoral patients and 43 femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal patients. Gradients averaged 28 +/- 8 (SD) (range, 15 to 50) mm Hg. The post femorofemoral bypass gradients were treated by immediate supplementary inflow extension to the aorta (three patients) or an axillary artery (three patients); by postoperative iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (four patients) or by no treatment (six patients with femoral/brachial pressure gradients of 15 to 35 [23 +/- 5] mm Hg). The 43 postfemoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypass gradients were treated by immediate supplementary inflow extension to the contralateral femoral artery (15 patients), the aorta (8 patients), or an axillary artery (3 patients); by postoperative iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (5 patients) or by no treatment (12 patients with femoral/brachial pressure gradients of 15 to 30 [21 +/- 4] mm Hg). No thrombosis occurred in the 10 femorofemoral bypasses with postbypass femoral/brachial pressure gradients that were treated. One of the six femorofemoral patients with untreated gradients required a subsequent aortic extension, and one thrombosed after 2 years. Of the 12 untreated patients with femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypasses one graft occluded early, and two late failures occurred 12 and 18 months later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arteries injured were ulnar (34), radial (28), brachial (22), subclavian (6), and axillary (5). Numbers of patients with associated injuries were nerve (53), vein (27), bone (23), and soft tissue injuries (60). The most common techniques of arterial repair were end-to-end anastomosis (50), followed by interposition saphenous vein grafting (40). Fasciotomy was used in 36 patients. Two arterial repairs failed during surgery and required revision (1) or thrombectomy (1). One radial artery repair thrombosed during late follow-up, with maintenance of normal extremity perfusion via the ulnar artery. No amputations were required, and 83% of all patients treated for nerve injuries resolved or improved their neurologic deficits. Two or more operations for surgical debridement and subsequent wound closure were required in 35 patients. This study supports an aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment of complex upper extremity vascular trauma emphasizing meticulous surgical technique, liberal use of fasciotomy, and aggressive intraoperative debridement and repair of associated injuries.\r"

During a 3 1/2-year period from January 1985 through June 1988, 4988 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures were performed at Emory University Hospital. All patients were given heparin during the cardiac intervention, and all had a catheter introducer left in place for several hours after completion of the procedure. Fifty-five iatrogenic vascular complications developed in 52 patients (1%), resulting in 54 corrective operations. Pseudoaneurysm, the most frequent complication, was seen in 35 patients (64%). This was followed by arteriovenous fistula in eight (15%), uncontrolled hemorrhage in six (11%), arterial thrombosis in three (6%), peripheral embolization in two (4%), and bowel ischemia in one patient. The outcome of surgical therapy in the entire group was quite acceptable with no operative mortality, no extremity amputation, and a 7.4% complication rate. Variables that correlated with an increased risk of peripheral vascular problems after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty included advanced age, female gender, thrombolytic therapy, and postprocedural anticoagulation. Variables that did not appear to correlate were hypertension, diabetes, prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, antiplatelet therapy, or the size of the guiding catheter used.\r"

Initial diagnostic investigations were compatible with multiple pulmonary emboli, but no source was identified. Subsequently, an indium 111-labeled platelet scan confirmed a site of active thrombus formation in the right lower extremity above the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging defined a saccular aneurysm of the popliteal vein, which was confirmed by contrast venography. Thereafter, the patient had resection of the venous aneurysm and tangential venorrhaphy. After operation duplex scanning confirmed patency of the venous repair.

  ".W": "Distal internal carotid artery exposure can be technically demanding even for experienced vascular surgeons. Although a variety of techniques have been described to facilitate such exposure, temporary mandibular subluxation has emerged as the simplest and least debilitating approach. Current techniques for maintaining temporary mandibular subluxation during distal internal carotid artery procedures, including maxillomandibular arch bar fixation and circummandibular/transnasal wiring, have been time consuming and associated with complications. Over the last 4 years a new simplified technique of temporary mandibular subluxation fixation has been used in 14 patients requiring distal internal carotid exposure. Indications for operation included extended carotid endarterectomy (8), carotid body tumor excision (2), repair of distal internal carotid artery trauma (2), and repair of postendarterectomy pseudoaneurysm (2). Among patients with healthy teeth, unilateral temporary mandibular subluxation was maintained by interdental wiring from the ipsilateral mandibular bicuspids to the contralateral maxillary bicuspids. In edentulous patients or those with chronic periodontal disease, temporary mandibular subluxation was maintained with diagonal wiring between maxillary and mandibular Steinmann pins. No instances of malocclusion, dental injury, or local infection were observed. Transient postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction was observed in three patients. Transient ipsilateral temporomandibular joint pain occurred in three patients. Two patients developed permanent cranial nerve injuries unrelated to temporary mandibular subluxation. These data suggest that temporary mandibular subluxation by diagonal interdental/Steinmann pin wiring is safe, expeditious, and effective in facilitating exposure of the distal internal carotid artery.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the benefit of carotid patch angioplasty, a retrospective study of 1000 consecutive carotid endarterectomies was done. Based on the type of carotid endarterectomy closure, patients were divided into four groups: 250 had primary closure, 250 had expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch, 250 had Dacron patch, and 250 had saphenous vein patch. On the basis of operative technique or type of carotid artery closure, no statistical difference was found in the incidence of postoperative stroke (p greater than 0.25): primary closure 1.6% (4), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 2.0% (5), Dacron patch 1.6% (4), and saphenous vein patch (0). Postoperative carotid patency was determined by B-mode ultrasonography, and 717 patients were evaluated in follow-up extending to 6 years (mean 37.8 months). Based on the method of carotid endarterectomy closure, no significant difference (p greater than 0.25) was found in the incidence of significant restenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction): primary closure 4.0% (7), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 4.0% (6), Dacron 5.4% (9), and saphenous vein 1.0% (2). Significant restenosis was most frequent in habitual smokers (93%, 25/28) and females (78%, 22/28) despite the method of carotid endarterectomy closure. No statistical difference was found in the incidence of late ipsilateral stroke either (p greater than 0.25): primary closure 2.9% (5), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 2% (3), Dacron 5% (3), and saphenous vein 0%. These results indicate that the incidence of postoperative stroke, regardless of method of arterial closure, was not statistically different. The method of carotid closure did not appear to affect the occurrence of late ipsilateral stroke or restenosis; however, patch angioplasty with saphenous vein appears appropriate in habitual smokers, and likely in patients with small internal carotid arteries.\r"

Common causes include damage to the cochleovestibular nerve by viral infection, autoimmune disease, vascular insult, and labyrinthine membrane rupture. A 70-year-old man had a history of recent diplopia, dysarthria, syncopal episodes, dysequilibrium, and the sudden onset of deafness in his right ear. Angiography demonstrated severe ulcerative stenosis of the right internal carotid origin and an anomalous vessel (probable remnant of hypoglossal artery) originating from the distal right internal carotid artery that perfused the entire distal vertebral and basilar artery circulation. Arch angiograms confirmed the absence of a proximal right vertebral artery and revealed a small left vertebral artery that ended in the cervical region without reaching the posterior fossa. Standard right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty resolved all neurologic symptoms except for persistent unilateral deafness at 9 months' follow-up. Presumed embolization through this anomalous vessel to the internal auditory artery and subsequent cochlear and vestibular branches represents the first reported case of sudden hearing loss as a result of anterior circulatory ulcerative disease.\r"

  ".W": "The titanium Greenfield filter was developed to facilitate operative and percutaneous insertion by a carrier (12F) smaller than that required for the standard stainless steel filter (24F). In preliminary clinical studies however, it proved to have an unacceptable rate of distal slippage and caval wall penetration. Therefore four modifications in hook design and base diameter have been tested in 20 sheep by implantation above and below the renal veins. In comparison to control titanium Greenfield filters (n = 8), neither changes in hook angle with smaller diameter base (type I, n = 4), elimination of limb flare (type II, n = 4), or 80 degree hook angle (type IV, n = 10) prevented migration and entry into venous tributaries or penetration. Penetration scores on the basis of autopsy findings did not correlate with antemortem predictions based on cavograms and showed 1.5 +/- 2.0/filter for controls, 1.0 +/- 1.15/filter for type I, 1.75 +/- 0.96/filter for type II and 1.67 +/- 1.37/filter for type IV. It was necessary to change the configuration of the hook completely to a recurved hook design providing a base pad for the 80 degree hook (type VI, n = 6) to limit migration and penetration with a score of 0.33 +/- 0.82/filter. Effects of experimental embolism were studied in six sheep (two acute, four chronic) and showed effective trapping by both type IV and type VI filters with no evidence of filter migration or damage to the caval wall. Persistent thrombus appeared to be caused by the remnants of oxidized cellulose used to induce thrombi, but there was no evidence of propagation proximal to the filter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation has been suggested as an alternative treatment in patients with limb-threatening ischemia in whom vascular reconstructive surgery is not possible anymore. We studied the effects of epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation on microcirculatory blood flow in 20 patients with ischemic rest pain and ulcers. Angiography showed occluded crural arteries technically unsuitable for reconstructive surgery. Intravital capillary microscopy was used to assess capillary density and diameter and red blood cell velocity before and after a 1-minute period of arterial occlusion. After epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation 18 patients claimed immediate pain relief, which was confirmed by intravital capillary microscopy. Capillary density increased from 10 to 19/mm2 (p less than 0.001), red blood cell velocity increased from 0.088 to 0.496 mm/sec (p less than 0.001), and peak red blood cell velocity after arterial occlusion increased from 0.092 to 0.548 mm/sec (p less than 0.001). Two patients had no immediate pain relief; they did not show improvement of microcirculatory perfusion, and amputation was necessary. During the follow-up period (3 months to 3 years, mean 27 months), six other patients had recurrent ischemic pain, and amputation was necessary. In 12 patients pain relief continued, and ischemic ulcers healed; capillary microscopy confirmed improved microcirculatory blood flow. Microcirculatory parameters were significantly higher in respondents than in nonrespondents (p less than 0.001). Life-table analysis revealed a cumulative foot salvage of 80% and 56% after 1 and 2 years, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In immunologically defined National Institutes of Health miniswine, a segment of internal jugular vein was anastomosed to the carotid artery as an interposition graft. Patency of swine major histocompatibility complex matched, one haplotype mismatched, and complete mismatched veins was 9.8, 6.3, and 3.0 weeks respectively (p = 0.009). More than 90% of mismatched and 20% of matched allografts developed a positive crossmatch before occlusion (p = 0.006). The mixed lymphocyte response did not predict graft occlusion. Treatment of 10 swine with cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day) did not significantly improve patency for one haplotype mismatched grafts. In haplotype mismatched veins, cryopreserved grafts occluded more rapidly than noncryopreserved grafts: mean 2.4 versus 6.3 weeks, respectively (p = 0.002). In all cryopreserved vein grafts, alloantibody appeared at or after graft occlusion rather than before occlusion as seen with fresh allografts (p = 0.046). The mean patency of cryopreserved versus fresh autografts was 3.3 and greater than 32 weeks, respectively (p = 0.004). In summary, these results indicate that (1) allograft patency is related to the degree of swine major histocompatibility complex match and development of cytotoxic alloantibodies; (2) moderate-dose cyclosporine does not prolong allograft patency nor suppress development of antibody; (3) cryopreservation may accelerate graft occlusion through nonimmunologic mechanisms.\r"

The child has no evidence of recurrent hepatoblastoma. The results of grafting the retrohepatic vena cava have been notoriously poor. It is widely believed that a prosthetic vena cava graft cannot be expected to remain patent. Our experience with polytetrafluoroethylene and previous reports using Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene have shown that long-term patency of retrohepatic vena cava replacement with synthetic graft can be successful.\r"

Using US Vital Records, we examined asthma mortality from 1968 through 1987 to describe the rates of change among children and young adults (aged 5 to 34 years) with time and in small geographic areas. During the 1970s, US asthma mortality declined by 7.8% per annum (+/- 1.0%), declining faster among women and nonwhites. During the 1980s, mortality increased by 6.2% per annum (+/- 1.2%), increasing faster among those aged 5 to 14 years than among those aged 15 to 34 years. Small-area geographic analysis revealed four areas with persistently high asthma mortality. Neither changes in International Classification of Diseases coding nor improved recognition of asthma, as demonstrated by trends in autopsy rates or rates of in-hospital deaths, seems to explain the increasing mortality of the 1980s.\r"

The increase was largest among 0 to 4 year olds, 5.0% per annum (95% Cl, 3.4% to 6.7%), vs 2.9% per annum (95% Cl, -0.3% to 6.2%) observed among 5 to 17 year olds. Among children aged 0 to 4 years, blacks had approximately 1.8 times the increase of whites. During this time, total hospitalizations decreased -4.6% (95% Cl, -6.6% to -2.5%), while admissions for lower respiratory tract disease had a statistically insignificant decrease: -1.3%. Acute and chronic/unspecified bronchitis hospitalizations decreased -6.1% (95% Cl, -9.4% to -2.7%), but this decrease did not begin until 1983. Thus, a shift in coding from bronchitis to asthma does not seem to fully explain the increase.\r"

Residents and faculty generally had somewhat negative attitudes toward the educational and informational value of detailing activities at their institutions but indicated that representatives supported important conferences and speakers. Residents were more likely than faculty to perceive contacts with sales representatives as potentially influencing physician decision making. Sixty-seven percent of faculty and 77% of residents indicated that physicians could be compromised by accepting gifts. More than half of the physicians who suggested that such compromise was possible indicated that acceptance of gifts worth more than +100 from drug companies would be likely to compromise a physician's independence and objectivity. A majority of both faculty and house staff favored eliminating presentations by pharmaceutical representatives at their hospitals. Only 10% thought they had had sufficient training during medical school and residency regarding professional interaction with sales representatives.\r"

A case is defined by debilitating myalgias and absolute eosinophilia greater than or equal to 1.0 x 10(9) cells/L. As of July 10, 1990, a total of 1531 cases had been reported nationwide, including 27 deaths. The highest rates of reported illness are concentrated in the western states, 68% are non-Hispanic white women aged 35 years and older, and data on associated clinical findings suggest a multisystemic disorder. The most frequent features include arthralgia (73%), rash (60%), cough or dyspnea (59%), peripheral edema (59%), elevated aldolase level (46%), and elevations in the results of liver function tests (43%). Neuropathy or neuritis, resulting in paralysis and death in some patients, was seen in 27%, and chest roentgenogram abnormalities were noted in 21% of those tested. Ninety-one percent reported onset of symptoms during or after May 1989, and 97% reported having taken tryptophan before the onset of symptoms. Since the recall of over-the-counter preparations of tryptophan in November 1989, the number of new cases of this potentially fatal disorder has fallen dramatically.\r"

The data were analysed by the LIPED program to calculate lod scores, by several programs to detect potential heterogeneity of recombination fraction between pedigrees, and by the affected-sibling and the affected-pedigree-member methods. The results exclude close linkage. If the putative susceptibility genes lie on chromosome 6 they must lie at least 5 centiMorgans, and probably more, from the HLA DR beta loci.

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus and bilateral optic atrophy are the defining characteristics of the autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome. Diabetes insipidus, neurogenic bladder, deafness, and other neurological manifestations are frequent. A review was made of the medical records of 68 Wolfram syndrome patients, aged between 8 and 43 years, identified by casefinding throughout the USA. 41 of the patients (60%) had episodes of severe depression, psychosis, or organic brain syndrome, as well as impulsive verbal and physical aggression. These symptoms were very severe in 17 patients (25%), of whom 12 required admission to a psychiatric hospital and 11 attempted suicide. We conclude that the Wolfram syndrome gene predisposes homozygotes to psychiatric illness.\r"

Cancer cells were obtained from ascitic fluid and a cultured cell line established. Incubation of the culture medium of these cells with skin fibroblasts from the patient and from normal subjects increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that gallbladder cancer cells from this patient secrete a substance that stimulates LDL receptor activity. This substance may have contributed towards reduction of serum cholesterol.\r"

All ten patients experienced transient increases in heart rate, low-grade fevers, and rigors. A neutrophil-dominated 100% rise in leucocyte counts occurred 4-8 h after treatment. Leucocyte counts returned to baseline levels within 24 h of interleukin-1 beta infusion. A 50% rise in platelets occurred in response to interleukin-1 beta; the increase in platelet counts was first noted 6 days after treatment began and was sustained for 24 days after treatment. Interleukin-1 beta may therefore be beneficial in the treatment of conditions of thrombocytopenia associated with haematological disorders and chemotherapy for malignant disorders.\r"

Refraction, keratometry, and computer-assisted corneal topographic analysis were performed before and after the procedure. In some eyes, preoperative topographic analysis revealed steepening distributed symmetrically about the corneal apex; in three eyes the steepening was asymmetrically distributed about the corneal apex. In one eye, surgery in a single, steep hemi-meridian superior to the corneal apex flattened that steep hemi-meridian but did not appear to alter the topography of the inferior steep hemi-meridian. Refractive and keratometric astigmatism decreased in all eyes (mean reductions of 3.25 and 2.30 diopters, respectively), and all incisions healed without incident. Surgery extended beyond the zone of steepening in one eye, shifting the axis of astigmatism. A large, multicenter, randomized trial will be necessary to determine whether detailed preoperative topographic analysis can be used to improve the results of surgery for astigmatism.\r"

We performed experiments to determine if consistent transscleral chorioretinal lesions could be produced in Dutch belted pigmented rabbits using the 810-nm laser, and if this modality caused less blood-retinal barrier disruption than retinal cryopexy of clinically equivalent treatment areas. The laser applications produced whitish to grayish-white retinal lesions when the surgeon, under direct visualization, used low powers and long durations (5 to 10 seconds), and controlled the treatment duration. Histopathologic evaluation of a lesion demonstrated an intact sclera overlying the chorioretinal lesion. Vitreous protein concentration, which was measured to assess blood-retinal barrier disruption, was significantly less in eyes treated with transscleral photocoagulation than in eyes treated with cryopexy of clinically equivalent treatment areas. We conclude that transscleral 810-nm laser treatment may be a viable clinical alternative to retinal cryopexy.\r"

The other eyes in both groups were dilated only on the second day, and thus served as controls. Pupil sizes were measured from photographs before and after dilation. The pupils of the eyes treated twice with either drug did not dilate as well after the second dose as those of the control eyes (P less than .005 for tropicamide, P less than .001 for cyclopentolate). The pupils of the eyes twice-treated with tropicamide were an average of 0.15 mm smaller than the control pupils; those twice-treated with cyclopentolate were 0.36 mm smaller. For subjects treated with cyclopentolate, this decreased mydriasis was related to age (P less than .05) and to eye color (P less than .025): the younger and blue-eyed subjects dilated less on the second day than the older and brown-eyed subjects. If full mydriasis is required at surgery, pupils should probably not be dilated with either tropicamide or cyclopentolate the day before surgery.\r"

A 0 to 500-mm Hg vacuum fixation ring and positioning apparatus mechanically locks globes into known spatial position while they are supported in a 2 to 6-mm Hg pressurized, pliable socket designed to match the size and pressure of a natural orbit. A gravity infusion system and an implantable piezoelectric pressure sensor in conjunction with a syringe and stopcock assembly allow for controlled inflation of globes to intraocular pressure (IOP) levels from 0 to 70 mm Hg, and to over 300 mm Hg. The fixation vacuum level, and intraocular and extraocular pressures are simultaneously monitored on 3-digit LED displays, and permanent records of each can be generated by routing data to storage devices. The anterior segment remains accessible at all times for surgical procedures and diagnostic measurements. The entire system is portable, allowing globes to be transported to multiple experimental stations, while all pressure settings and the position of the globe are maintained. To demonstrate applications of the artificial orbit system, we describe experiments using it to calibrate applanation tonometers, and to study the relationship between IOP and corneal curvature as well as the effect of trephination procedures and limbal vacuum fixation on IOP.\r"

In a principal components factor analysis, all but one item loaded significantly on six factors similar to those isolated previously during psychometric assessment of the English language version. Those six dimensions comprise the HPLP subscales of self-actualization, health responsibility, exercise, nutrition, interpersonal support, and stress management. The six factors explained 45.9% of the variance in the measure. Second-order factor analysis yielded a single factor, interpreted as health-promoting lifestyle. The alpha reliability coefficient for the total scale was .93 and 2-week test-retest reliability was .86; alpha coefficients for the subscales ranged from .70 to .87.\r"

Extremity wraps were used to modify the rate of heat loss from skin to prevent shivering stimulus. Duration of shivering and amount of meperidine required for shivering suppression were compared between treatment and control groups. Total shivering duration was shorter in the treatment group than in the control, p less than .005. Less meperidine was administered to the treatment group than to controls but differences were not statistically significant. The fact that nurses differ in their propensity to use a narcotic to treat shivering may make use of meperidine a poor measure of the intervention's efficacy. Shivering was found to significantly affect myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) among subjects who shivered. MVO2, as reflected in the rate pressure product, was found to be significantly higher during shivering (p less than .0001) than at pre- or postshivering periods.\r"

The two sites for auscultation were the antecubital fossa and the upper arm immediately superior to the internal medial condyle and medial to the biceps tendon. Simultaneous direct and indirect blood pressure readings were obtained from 50 critical care patients with indwelling radial arterial lines. The averages for three blood pressure readings obtained from each site and for each listening piece were correlated and compared with the averages of three simultaneous direct blood pressure readings. Statistical testing was done separately for systolic and diastolic readings. Auscultation techniques using both listening pieces and sites were found to be accurate, r greater than .8 for all correlations; p less than .0001 for all comparisons, but auscultation using the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the brachial artery in the upper arm provided the most accurate readings.\r"

Subjects responded to two questionnaires, judging similarity of the spices and indicating the sensory attributes important in their decision making. Intensity of odor, compatibility with sweetness, and degree of bitter taste were three major attributes used to arrive at similarity judgments. Overall, vanilla was found to be most similar to sugar. When examined further for compatibility with sweetness, cinnamon, vanilla, spearmint, and anise were generally found to be more comparable to sugar than nutmeg, ginger, cloves, bay, and salt. Nonwhite subjects, as opposed to white subjects, attributed greater sweetness to nutmeg and less sweetness to anise. The data suggest that certain spices exhibit sweet properties and may provide a healthful strategy for reducing sugar intake.\r"

Results from the regression analyses indicated that 35% of the variance in depression and 33% of the variance in purpose-in-life, respectively, were explained by age, sex, social status, and the perceived supportiveness and unsupportiveness of social network interactions. The path analyses showed that the perceived supportiveness of interactions was directly related to purpose-in-life but not to depression; both the direct path between the perceived unsupportiveness of interactions and adaptation and the indirect one through perceived uncertainty were related to depression and to purpose-in-life; and functional disability had a direct effect on adaptation, but the indirect path through perceived uncertainty was not corroborated.\r"

Data were collected through interviews and completion of the Mental Health Index, Health-Related Hardiness Scale, and Margin in Life. Psychological adaptation was found to be independent of diagnosis. Four predictor variables (health promotion activities, psychological distress, physiologic adaptation, and dependence on medications) significantly discriminated among the three groups and correctly classified 73.08% of the total sample. Presence of the hardiness characteristic was significantly related to psychological and physiologic adaptation, involvement in health promotion activities, and participation in patient education programs. It can be concluded that a diagnosis-specific view of psychological status is not tenable or clinically meaningful.\r"

Blinded interpretations were correlated with clinical, microbiologic, and surgical findings. MR imaging enabled prediction of the presence of neurologic complications in 93% of patients and diagnosis of the type of infection in 94%, and correlated well with surgical findings in 24 of 27 patients. Vertebral intraosseous abscesses, meningeal involvement, subligamentous spread, and paraspinal abscess location were best identified on contrast-enhanced studies and were seen most frequently in tuberculous spondylitis. High signal intensity on T1-weighted images of previously affected vertebrae suggested healing and correlated well with symptoms. The authors conclude that MR imaging may be useful as the method of first choice for the initial assessment and posttherapy follow-up of patients with granulomatous spinal infection.\r"

For the digital system, the effect of varying exposure parameters (photon flux and tube voltage) and unsharp mask filtering (kernel size and enhancement factor) was tested. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics was performed for 10,560 observations made by eight radiologists. Under identical exposure conditions, storage phosphor imaging yielded no significant advantages over conventional screen-film radiography. Although large variations in exposure dose are possible with storage phosphors, the potential for dose reduction was limited even by means of an increase in tube voltage. The performance with unsharp masked images declined with decreasing kernel size and pronounced enhancement.\r"

In 58 cases the cancer was detected by means of both clinical examination and mammography; in eight cases, mammography alone enabled readers to find the lesion; in seven cases, the lesion was found by means of clinical examination, but mammograms were negative; and in one case a cancer was found by means of incidental biopsy of the contralateral breast. Although 34 patients (52%) had dense breasts, mammography demonstrated the lesion in 66 cases (89%); the most common mammographic finding was microcalcifications, with or without associated masses (n = 28 [38%]). The authors do not suggest that screening of women younger than 35 years be performed routinely, but they believe that mammography can be valuable in screening young women at high risk for breast cancer or in confirming and suggesting prompt biopsy of a suspicious lesion.\r"

Nonspecific pulmonary infiltrates were identified in nine of the 11 patients (82%). Four patients had interstitial infiltrates, four had mixed alveolar and interstitial disease, and one had a conglomerate mass. CT findings of high-attenuation parenchymal-pleural abnormalities are thought to be related to the iodinated chemistry of the drug and its prolonged half-life within the lung. These unique properties of the drug and the use of CT to discriminate attenuation levels provide a means of identifying patients with significant pulmonary accumulation of amiodarone.\r"

  ".W": "The authors retrospectively studied 43 patients suspected of having internal hemorrhoids at double-contrast barium enema examination. At endoscopy, 24 patients (56%) had internal hemorrhoids, four (9%) had other pathologic lesions in the rectum without evidence of hemorrhoids, and 15 (35%) had no reported abnormalities in the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids were found at endoscopy in 10 of 20 patients (50%) with lobulated folds extending 3 cm or less from the anorectal junction and 10 of 13 patients (77%) with multiple submucosal nodules. However, no patients with these characteristic radiographic findings were found to have other pathologic lesions in the rectum that had been mistaken for hemorrhoids at barium enema examination. Conversely, three of four patients with lobulated folds extending more than 3 cm from the anorectal junction and one of six patients with solitary nodules had proctitis or rectal neoplasms. Thus, specific criteria are suggested for the diagnosis of internal hemorrhoids on double-contrast barium enema examinations. Suspected hemorrhoids that do not fulfill these criteria should be evaluated endoscopically to rule out other more serious pathologic lesions in the rectum.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is recognized that some gallstones float at oral cholecystography, the reasons for this are not known. To determine how stone type and composition are related to stone buoyancy, the authors analyzed gallstones from 90 patients in the National Cooperative Gallstone Study. Seventeen patients had floating and 73 had nonfloating radiolucent stones at oral cholecystography. Stone analysis showed that all 17 floating stones were cholesterol stones; 64 of the nonfloating stones were cholesterol stones, while nine were pigment stones. The cholesterol contents of floating and nonfloating cholesterol stones were similar, 90.4% +/- 1.7 and 87.0% +/- 1.2 of stone weight, respectively. The calcium salt content of the nonfloating cholesterol stones was 3.2% +/- 0.6, while that of the floating cholesterol stones was only 1.1% +/- 0.4 (P = .02). The results indicate that floating gallstones are cholesterol stones with a significantly lower calcium salt content than that of nonfloating cholesterol stones.\r"

In all patients a final clinical diagnosis was obtained with follow-up for a minimum of 4 months and, in most patients with obstruction or dysfunction, with surgery, intraoperative cholangiography, ultrasound, and/or computed tomography. Heart (blood pool) and liver time-activity curves were generated for 32 minutes after intravenous injection of 5-15 mCi (185-555 MBq) of Tc-99m disofenin and were subjected to deconvolutional analysis to determine the first-pass hepatocyte extraction fraction (HEF) of the tracer. The difference in HEF between patients with obstruction and those with dysfunction was highly significant (P = 3.3 X 10(-19)). Deconvolutional analysis eliminates the effects of tracer recirculation, thus permitting direct measurement of hepatic disofenin extraction, and appears to provide functional information useful in evaluation of the patient with acute jaundice.\r"

A high prevalence of previous ectopic pregnancy (n = 8, 36%), tubal ligation and/or reconstruction (n = 5, 23%), spontaneous or therapeutic abortion (n = 6, 27%), and previous intrauterine device use (n = 14, 64%) was noted. The authors successfully catheterized 40 (98%) of 41 tubes without serious complication and visualized the distal tube in 36 (88%) of 41 tubes. Free spill in at least one tube was seen in 17 (77%) of 22 patients. Nineteen patients had a history of previous laparoscopy or laparotomy for tubal disease, in 16 of whom laparoscopic results were available for review. Retrospectively, in 15 (94%) of 16 patients all clinically relevant abnormalities would have been detected by means of TFTC alone. Five patients conceived, three with intrauterine and two with ectopic pregnancies. Patients with intrauterine pregnancies had normal-appearing tubes after TFTC, while those with ectopic pregnancies had residual tubal abnormalities after recanalization. TFTC is a safe, accurate diagnostic procedure that provides more information than hysterosalpingography and, in most cases, as much or more information about the fallopian tubes than laparoscopy.\r"

These fetuses were considered at risk for skeletal dysplasias and were followed up. Studies were performed at a mean gestational age of 26.7 weeks (range, 15.3-41.0 weeks). Group 1 had a femur length 1-4 mm below the 2-SDs line (range, -2.0 to -4.0 SDs); no other abnormalities were detected. Interval examination of 12 femurs showed that 10 either remained shortened to the same degree or had a growth spurt. At birth, all subjects were healthy except one with mild growth retardation and one with a chromosomal abnormality. Of the two subjects that failed to continue normal growth, one was healthy and the other was a heterozygous achondroplastic dwarf. Group 2 had greater femoral shortness; all measurements were more than 5 mm below the 2-SD line (range, -4.3 to -31.0 SDs). All had fetal abnormalities and significant skeletal dysplasias. The authors conclude that the number of millimeters below the 2-SDs line is an accurate, easy criterion for evaluation of femoral length.\r"

Lymphomas were relatively homogeneous: Only 6% of the lesions had broad, bimodal, or skewed distributions of pixel intensities that could be attributed to intrinsic heterogeneity. On average, lymphomas were hypointense to fat and slightly hyperintense to muscle in T1-weighted images but isointense to fat and hyperintense to muscle in T2-weighted images. Low-, intermediate-, and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas had identical imaging characteristics. The most striking and significant result was the greater brightness of lymphomas with dense fibrosis in T2-weighted images, which explains the trend toward greater brightness of Hodgkin disease than that of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and greater brightness of lymphomas in the mediastinum than of lymphomas in other locations. Neither a contrast parameter nor the T1-T2 cross product added information not evident with the use of simple mean pixel intensity ratios.\r"

Three-dimensional imaging offers many advantages over two-dimensional multisection imaging but is susceptible to image corruption due to motion. Thus, it has been of limited use in the imaging of mobile structures, and the relatively long imaging times required have hindered its use in patients who tend to move during imaging. The authors' technique uses interleaved \"navigator\" echoes to provide a measure of displacement for each image echo in the acquisition and then uses this information to allow correction of the image data. The theory for signal corruption due to motion and the correction scheme that follows from it are presented. This method can produce excellent results when the motion is correctly modeled.\r"

Grade 1 artifacts and pitfalls were mimics of aortic dissection on individual images but could be demonstrated not to represent a dissection when other images from the same sequence were evaluated. Grade 2 artifacts and pitfalls required the use of images from other planes or sequences to distinguish them from a dissection. Grade 3 artifacts and pitfalls could not be distinguished from a dissection without the use of other imaging modalities. Of the 53 cases examined, 34 (64%) had artifacts or pitfalls of grade 1 or higher, 10 (19%) had artifacts or pitfalls of grade 2 or higher, and one case (2%) had grade 3 artifacts or pitfalls. Sixteen cases had more than one artifact or pitfall. Pitfalls and artifacts that mimic aortic dissection occur in a significant percentage of thoracic MR imaging examinations. An awareness of their existence, knowledge of normal anatomy, the use of axial images in all cases with the addition of images in other planes as needed, rotation of phase and frequency gradients as needed, and clinical correlation may avert misinterpretation in nearly all cases.\r"

Direct mesenteric vein catheterization allows simplified entry into the portal vein for embolization of bleeding esophageal or gastric varices. Early experience suggests that the results are similar to those of percutaneous transhepatic embolization, without the complications and technical demands of a transhepatic approach.\r"

Findings in GRE MR images were negative in 42 patients (64%) and positive in 24 patients (36%). In patients who underwent confirmatory venography, the sensitivity of GRE MR imaging was 100% and the specificity was 92.9%. No patient with a negative GRE MR study developed DVT or pulmonary emboli during the follow-up period. Although seven patients in this group died, the single autopsy showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, and no clinical evidence existed to suggest that pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in any of the other six patients. It is concluded that GRE MR imaging is an accurate, noninvasive means of detecting DVT.\r"

Bleeding was controlled completely in 15 (62%) and partially in three (13%) of the patients who underwent embolotherapy. In nine of the patients treated with nontranscatheter therapy (75%), bleeding control was complete. Sixteen patients died, including seven of 28 in whom bleeding was controlled. There was no significant difference in the mortality rates of patients treated with nontranscatheter therapy (46% and 42%, respectively). Survival correlated with the clinical condition at the time of intervention. All patients with multiorgan failure died, while 87% of the other patients, even those with serious cardiovascular compromise, survived. The results imply that massive gastric hemorrhage should be treated aggressively, before it results in multiorgan failure.\r"

Forty-eight patients also underwent non-contrast material-enhanced thin-section computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine. MR imaging was the definitive modality in the assessment of soft-tissue injury, especially in the evaluation of the spinal cord and intervertebral disks. All patients with a neurologic deficit had abnormal spinal cords at MR imaging. Intramedullary hemorrhage was predictive of a complete lesion. The degree of associated bone and soft-tissue injury had no bearing on the extent of spinal cord injury or neurologic deficit. Patients with residual cord compression following reduction demonstrated greater neurologic compromise than those without compression.\r"

The biliary obstruction was due to a malignant neoplasm in 21 patients and a postoperative biliary stricture in two patients. The lesions affected the intrahepatic biliary ducts in 13 patients. Twelve patients had undergone radiation therapy before stent placement. The endoprostheses consisted of 196 expandable metallic biliary stents placed singly (n = 10) or in tandem (n = 186). As many as 18 stents were used to relieve an obstruction in one patient. A transhepatic approach was employed in all patients except one in whom stents were placed through a T-tube tract. Within 1 week after placement, all stents expanded to at least 90% of their original diameter. Three misplaced, two deformed, and two dislodged stents caused no obvious clinical problems. At follow-up, which ranged from 2 to 59 weeks, five patients experienced recurrent jaundice. Two patients with recurrent jaundice due to obstruction of the bile duct containing the stent were treated with external catheter drainage. The expandable biliary endoprosthesis is suggested as an effective treatment for benign and malignant biliary obstruction.\r"
