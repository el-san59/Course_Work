All patients have had follow-up for at least 5 years. Five patients (22%) had exploratory laparotomy and diverting colostomy before irradiation. All patients were irradiated with megavoltage equipment to the pelvis at 180 rad/fraction, continuous-course technique. Total doses ranged from 3500 to 6000 rad with a mean of 4800 rad and a median of 5000 rad. All patients had surgery 2-11 weeks (mean: 4.9 weeks; median: 4 weeks) after radiation therapy. Twelve patients (52%) had lesions that were incompletely resected because of positive margins (7 patients), distant metastasis (1 patient), or both (4 patients). All of these patients died of cancer within 5 years of treatment. Eleven patients had an apparent complete excision of their rectal cancer; six patients (55%) subsequently had a local recurrence. The 5-year absolute survival rate for patients who had complete resection was 18% (2 of 11 patients). The 5-year absolute and determinate survival rates for the entire study were 9% (2 of 23 patients) and 9% (2 of 22 patients), respectively. One patient (in the incomplete resection group) died after operation secondary to sepsis and diffuse intravascular coagulation.\r"

From 1970-1984 a more conservative approach to NPHC was adopted in 22 patients with large symptomatic cysts. Seventeen patients were treated with simple unroofing without complication. By comparison, two of three patients treated by Roux-en-Y drainage developed infected hepatic cysts that required subsequent surgical drainage. Patients treated by external drainage without unroofing or hepatic resection had either cyst recurrence or complications. In conclusion, wide unroofing is the treatment of choice for NPHC even when the cyst fluid is bile stained.\r"

There were three anastomotic leaks (2 radiologic only) and one postoperative death (3.5%). Long-term follow-up results were favorable in all but one patient who had scleroderma. Despite this, radionuclide transit studies with a standardized solid egg white bolus showed a delayed transit (3.6 +/- 0.4 minutes) compared with normal controls (10.4 +/- 2.6 seconds) (p less than 0.001). The time activity curves and condensed image computer analysis of the 1-second frames showed that the contractions of the interposed jejunum were segmental rather than peristaltic. This accounts for the delayed transit in the esophageal group. Histologic studies on endoscopic biopsies of the jejunal loops obtained after 12 months of the operation confirmed the retention of a normal villous architecture with Paneth cell hyperplasia but no evidence of metaplasia.\r"

  ".W": "A method of quantifying the anatomic extent of injury to the heart, Penetrating Cardiac Trauma Index, (PCTI) and other thoracic organs has been proposed. The total extent of thoracic injury, Penetrating Thoracic Trauma Index (PTTI), was measured. When associated abdominal injury was present, it was assessed by the Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI) of Moore et al. The severity of total injury sustained by the patient, represented by the Penetrating Trauma Index (PTI), was determined by the sum total of these scores. The extent of physiologic abnormality induced by cardiac penetration, (Physiologic Index or PI), was graded on a scale of increasing severity from 5-20 based on the vital signs of patients on admission. Analysis of 112 patients with penetrating cardiac injuries (1973-1983) revealed that the indices, PCTI and PI, showed an excellent correlation with survival (R2 = 0.827 and 0.928, respectively) as did the total extent of trauma (PTI). A composite prognostic score of the sum of PI and PTI demonstrated a significant separation of survivors from nonsurvivors (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that these anatomic (PCTI and PTI) and physiologic (PI) indices are valid and, with additional confirmation, may provide an objective method of evaluating penetrating cardiac injuries.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the specific effects of inhalation injury and pneumonia on mortality in burn patients, the records of 1058 patients treated at a single institution over a five-year period, 1980-1984, were reviewed. Of these patients, 373 (35%) had inhalation injury diagnosed by bronchoscopy and/or ventilation perfusion lung scan. Of the 373 patients, 141 (38%) had subsequent pneumonia. Among the patients without inhalation injury, pneumonia occurred in 60 of 685 (8.8%). A multiple logistic equation was developed to estimate expected mortality at any age and burn size for patients without either inhalation injury or pneumonia, with either alone, or with both. Subtraction of the expected mortality without either inhalation injury or pneumonia from the expected mortality in the presence of either or both permitted the estimation of additional mortality attributable to these complications. Inhalation injury alone increased mortality by a maximum of 20% and pneumonia by a maximum of 40%, with a maximum increase of approximately 60% when both were present. The influence on mortality was maximal in the midrange of expected mortality without these complications for any age group. These data indicate that inhalation injury and pneumonia have significant, independent, additive effects on burn mortality and that these effects vary with age and burn size in a predictable manner.\r"

This report describes 110 reversed vein bypasses (RVB) to infrapopliteal arteries performed from 1980-1986. Thirty-three per cent of these patients did not have an intact ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. One hundred per cent of patients had autogenous RVB performed using a variety of techniques, including vein splicing, use of arm veins, lesser saphenous veins, branch veins, and use of graft origins distal to the common femoral artery. The life table patency figures for these grafts are 90%, 85%, and 85% at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. The life table limb salvage at 5 years is 93%. These figures for patency, vein utilization, and limb salvage for modern RVB to infrapopliteal arteries are clearly equal to or superior to any reported figures for ISVB. Results for RVB are greatly improved when compared with historic controls, as are results for ISVB. There is no evidence to date demonstrating superiority of one technique versus another.\r"

  ".W": "Between October, 1982, and December, 1984, 126 patients at the Texas Heart Institute underwent mitral valve repair for mitral insufficiency utilizing the Puig-Massana-Shiley annuloplasty ring. Resection of a triangular-shaped wedge of the mural leaflet and direct suture repair was done in 42 patients, and anterior leaflet repair was used in 2 patients. There were 79 male (63%) and 47 female (37%) patients with a mean age of 58 years. Preoperatively, 95% were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class III or IV. Concomitant cardiac operations were performed in 82 patients and included coronary artery bypass grafting (49%), aortic valve replacement (16%), repair of ventricular septal defect (2%), resection of left ventricular aneurysm (2%), and repair of atrial septal defect (1%). There were 8 early deaths (6.3%) and 11 late deaths (8.7%). In 44 patients undergoing mitral valve repair as an isolated primary procedure, operative mortality was 2.3%. Murmurs of mitral insufficiency were present in 5 patients postoperatively, but only 1 required early reoperation for mitral valve replacement. Follow-up data have been obtained on 80% of the patients. Postoperative Functional Class was obtained for 63 of the 82 surviving patients and showed 92% of these patients to be in NYHA Functional Class I or II. Mitral valve repair incorporating the Puig-Massana-Shiley annuloplasty ring and valve leaflet revision is a reliable technique that is not technically demanding. We believe these methods should be attempted for correction of pure mitral insufficiency, particularly in circumstances where other cardiac repairs are required.\r"

Risk was assigned before operation using data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) and the recent literature. Data were collected by a full-time data manager and were stored and analyzed by computer. From January 1, 1984, to July 1, 1985, 1,303 patients underwent operation for acquired disease. This group included 913 patients undergoing isolated primary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The comparison of predicted and observed results showed: (Table: see text). For patients undergoing isolated primary CABG, the elective group had an operative mortality of 0.6% (2/329); the urgent group, 1.1% (5/450); and the emergent group, 5.2% (7/134). Preoperative risk assignment is an effective method of quality assurance. Female sex and age older than 60 years, which predicted an operative mortality of 2 to 5% in the CASS study and other recent series, did not predict a similar risk in our series.\r"

The antegrade (through the aorta) and the retrograde (through the coronary sinus) methods of cardioplegia infusion were compared using myocardial thermograms. Patients (N = 8) were matched according to angiographic similarities of their coronary artery disease. Adequate myocardial cooling distal to a critical obstruction could frequently not be obtained with antegrade infusion of cardioplegic solution. With retrograde infusion, the desired uniform cooling of the myocardium, as determined by thermographic analysis of the surface temperatures of the heart, was obtained. We conclude that retrograde infusion of cardioplegic solution induces more effective and homogeneous hypothermia in patients with critically obstructive multivessel coronary disease, and may provide improved myocardial protection.\r"

Favorable responses were noted in 36% of patients so treated. In 1985, another group of 16 patients with refractory ATP received therapy with autologous opsonized erythrocytes (AOPE) and 55% of these patients showed favorable responses. Five (17%) of the patients treated using the radioimmune method attained a complete, long-term (greater than 35 months) remission of their ATP, and five (31%) of the patients treated using AOPE remained in complete remission over 270 days after cessation of therapy. Major complications were not seen. We concluded that the interaction of macrophages with low-dose AOPE is a successful therapeutic approach in ATP refractory to standard treatment.\r"

Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 104 patients and excluded in 535. An elevated total CK level had a sensitivity of only 38% and specificity of only 80%, whereas a CK-MB level over 5% of an elevated total CK level had a sensitivity of only 34% and specificity of 88%. The sensitivities of both CK and CK-MB were higher in patients who arrived more than four hours after the onset of symptoms, and, in this population, the strategy using CK-MB performed significantly better than the strategy using total CK alone. Since a very positive CK-MB in a low-risk patient can greatly raise the probability of myocardial infarction, future strategies using CK-MB may have a role in selected subsets in determining which patients should not be sent home. However, the sensitivity of a single sampling of CK and CK-MB is too low for these assays to be used to exclude myocardial infarction in the emergency room or to be used as the rationale for deciding not to admit a patient.\r"

  ".W": "Although impedance plethysmography (IPG) is a test of recognized value in the diagnosis of acute proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT), its meaning in patients with bilaterally abnormal IPGs is unclear. Consequently, we sought to determine the clinical significance of the bilaterally abnormal IPG in hospitalized patients. In a five-month prospective study, 19% (81/425) of all IPGs done at our institution were bilaterally abnormal (55% of all abnormal IPGs). Acute proximal DVT was found in 26% (14/53) of patients with bilaterally abnormal IPGs who underwent further diagnostic testing. Thirty-five percent of the patients with DVT were found to have either bilateral lower extremity DVT or clots in the inferior vena cava. A numerical score, the venous function index (VFI), was computed for the 101 legs for which further definitive diagnostic evaluations for DVT had been completed. The mean VFI of seven for legs with acute proximal DVT was significantly less than the mean VFI of 13 for legs with no DVT. Fifty percent of legs with a VFI less than or equal to five had DVT, whereas only 7% of legs with a VFI greater than 15 had DVT. The bilaterally abnormal IPG is a common clinical occurrence, is frequently associated with acute DVT, and the VFI is helpful in discriminating legs with acute proximal DVT from normal legs in patients with a bilaterally abnormal IPG.\r"

We retrospectively analyzed data on 209 overdose cases to determine whether clinical assessment in the emergency room could identify patients at risk for complications. Patients were classified as low risk when none of the following high-risk criteria were present in the emergency room: need for intubation; seizures; unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli; arterial carbon dioxide pressure (tension) greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg; any rhythm except sinus; second- or third-degree atrioventricular block; QRS greater than or equal to 0.12 s; or systolic pressure less than 80 mm Hg. Of 151 low-risk patients, none developed a high-risk condition after admission, and none required an intensive care intervention. The use of these predictive criteria in our patient population would have eliminated over half the intensive care days without compromising quality of care.\r"

We examined the psychological, functional, and financial consequences of omitting spine films for patients with back pain with little risk of underlying systemic illness. Patients were randomized to receive immediate roentgenograms (n = 49) or a brief educational intervention, with roentgenography only for failure to improve (n = 52). After three weeks, 73% of the roentgenography group believed \"everyone with back pain should have an x-ray,\" vs 44% of the education group. After three months, although 31% in the education group had received roentgenograms, overall radiology charges were still far less than those of the roentgenography group. No serious diagnoses were missed, and symptom resolution, functional improvement, and satisfaction were similar for the two groups. Thus, eliminating or delaying spine films need not cause anxiety, dissatisfaction, or dysfunction. This strategy may modify future expectations of roentgenography use and reduce health care costs.\r"

The patient's mother, who had no history of thromboembolic disease, was also antithrombin III deficient. Resistance to heparin is a theoretical, but inconsistently documented, feature of antithrombin III deficiency. This deficiency state should be considered whenever heparin resistance is encountered, even in the absence of a personal and family history of thromboses.\r"

Systolic pressure decreased more than 5 mm Hg (average, 14 mm Hg) in 50 patients, exceeding 30 mm Hg in nine (13%), while heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure (seven patients) did not change. Blood pressure decreased significantly more in patients requiring vasoconstrictor drug support. The arterial vasodilator properties of cimetidine were demonstrated in 12 normal volunteers in whom brachial artery cimetidine infusions caused a significant decrease of forearm vascular resistance. This effect was more pronounced when forearm vessels were preconstricted with dopamine hydrochloride (n = 6) or norepinephrine (n = 6), pointing toward an interference of cimetidine with sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. Thus, intravenous injection of cimetidine in critically ill patients, presumably through arterial vasodilatation, is frequently associated with decreases of blood pressure, particularly in patients requiring vasoconstrictor drug support.\r"

In contrast, 43 (8.6%) of 501 urine cultures obtained from uncatheterized patients not receiving antibiotic therapy were positive. These results indicate that concurrent antibiotic therapy should be considered before ordering urine cultures in uncatheterized patients.

Six of 15 patients who had toxic reactions presented with an acute illness that resembled an infectious disease. While diffuse interstitial disease was frequent on chest roentgenogram, seven of 15 had airspace opacities, and five had well-localized infiltrates. Physiologic changes were not uniformly found. An interstitial pneumonia with foamy alveolar macrophages was the most common pathologic finding. Foamy macrophages were also present in three of five nontoxic patients. Three of three patients who had toxic reactions, and two of five patients without toxic reactions had lamellated inclusion bodies by electron microscopy. We conclude that all features of amiodarone toxicity are protean, and it may mimic infectious diseases. While pathologic changes are often characteristic, neither foamy alveolar macrophages nor lamellated cytoplasmic inclusions reliably distinguish toxic from nontoxic patients.\r"

Pulmonary and esophageal symptoms were recorded on daily diary cards. Therapy was associated with prompt amelioration of reflux symptoms and with a less dramatic and more delayed improvement in pulmonary symptoms. Objectively, esophageal erosions healed completely in eight of the ten patients who had them at the beginning of the trial, and pulmonary function measurements improved significantly. Intraesophageal infusions of physiologic saline and 0.1N hydrochloric acid in patients and healthy controls did not significantly alter pulmonary function, as measured by standard spirometry. There is a subset of patients in whom bronchoconstriction is triggered by gastroesophageal reflux. Treatment of reflux in such patients may improve their asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Reye's syndrome (RS) is generally considered a childhood disease. We report our experience with RS in adults in the metropolitan Milwaukee area. Reye's syndrome was diagnosed in seven 18- to 46-year-old adults. The diagnostic criteria were as follows: viral prodrome followed by vomiting and encephalopathy without focal neurological signs, normal cerebrospinal fluid values, increased levels of serum aminotransferases (transaminase), prolonged prothrombin time, elevated blood ammonia levels, and characteristic microvesicular fatty liver and mitochondrial changes. None of the patients was hypoglycemic. The diagnosis of RS was entertained in 22 but confirmed in only seven patients. In cases of non-Reye's encephalopathy, drug ingestion presented as one of the most difficult differential diagnostic problems, which also included alcohol abuse, collagen vascular disease, and hepatitis B surface antigenemia. Clinical jaundice, distinctly uncommon in RS, was present in only one patient who presented to us in stage V coma. In adults, RS is more difficult to diagnose and should be suspected more frequently in patients with unexplained altered behavior following a viral illness and vomiting. Liver biopsy can be performed safely and is usually mandatory in adults. Patients with RS diagnosed during stage I or II coma and treated experienced an uneventful recovery.\r"

This prospective study of 261 consecutive men undergoing coronary arteriography was carried out to evaluate the association of the earlobe crease with the presence and extent of CAD. A positive earlobe crease was detected in 67% of this population. When examining the presence of CAD in men with (n = 175) and without (n = 86) an earlobe crease, 85% of those with and 85% of those without an earlobe crease showed some degree of CAD. Since the prevalence of an earlobe crease increased with advancing age, we examined the age-specific prevalence rates of CAD in men with and without an earlobe crease and found no significant differences in those rates. A similar lack of association between earlobe crease and CAD was seen when we simultaneously controlled for other potentially confounding factors. We conclude that the reported association between earlobe crease and CAD is due to the fact that the prevalence of earlobe crease and CAD each increase with age.\r"

Conjunctival PO2 and temperature in 23 asymptomatic homozygous patients with sickle cell anemia did not differ significantly from those in age-matched controls. However, 12 subjects in painful sickle cell crisis had a significantly lower conjunctival PO2 than before crisis despite no significant change in hematocrit and conjunctival temperature. Supplemental oxygen therapy significantly increased conjunctival PO2. When supplemental oxygen was removed, conjunctival PO2 decreased to the admission level despite clinical improvement. This finding supports the use of supplemental oxygen in treating crisis. Measuring conjunctival PO2 can give clinicians an assessment of the effect of sickle cell disease on a peripheral capillary bed and may provide the first objective method to reliably diagnose acute painful sickle cell crisis.\r"

Several prediction rules to guide the selective application of CT in the evaluation of dementia have recently been proposed in the medical literature. The present authors examine the value of four such rules through a validation study performed in an outpatient geriatric assessment unit. The rules were assessed in terms of their diagnostic sensitivities, specificities, misclassification rates, and information contents. Prediction rule sensitivities ranged from 12.5% to 87.5%, specificities from 37.2% to 77.9%, and misclassification rates from 23.5% to 60.8%. Of the four prediction rules examined, one emerged as significantly more sensitive than the others, and also served to reduce diagnostic uncertainty a full order of magnitude more than the others, as determined by an information content analysis. Disadvantages to this rule, however, were found in its more complex nature and the assessment of a very high rate of misclassification. Through a critique of existing strategies, this study purports to determine the potential for establishing a useful clinical prediction rule to guide selective CT scanning in the diagnostic evaluation of dementia.\r"

Thyroxine may produce regression in such nodules, but usually does not. Some authorities advise surgery for nonresponding nodules; others rely on repeat needle biopsy. In 246 patients, diagnoses by repeat needle biopsy confirmed 85% of the original diagnoses by needle biopsy. Initial benign diagnoses by needle biopsy were confirmed for 187 (91%) of 205 patients. Fourteen had surgery; all nodules were benign. Changes in diagnosis from benign to suspicious by needle biopsy were made for 12 patients; five had surgery, one had a Hurthle cell carcinoma. Changes in diagnosis from benign to malignant by needle biopsy were made in six patients; five had surgery, all lesions were malignant. Reliance on repeat needle biopsy is preferable to routine surgery for nodules not responding to thyroxine.\r"

Qualitative patterns in the thought disorder of schizoaffective patients were compared with those of 20 manic and 43 schizophrenic patients. Manic and schizoaffective-manic patients produced a high number of combinatory responses, but those produced by the schizoaffective-manic patients lacked the humor and playfulness of those of the manics. The schizoaffective-manic patients, like the schizophrenic patients, produced a high number of responses in the categories of idiosyncratic verbalizations, autistic thinking, and confusion. Unlike the manic patients, schizoaffective-depressed patients generally produced a few absurd and idiosyncratic responses in a setting of constricted output. The data strongly suggest that the thinking disorders of schizoaffective patients are like those of the schizophrenic patients.\r"

Diagnosis accounted for over 10% of the thought-disorder variance. Although there is a tendency for those persons with poor eye tracking to have higher amounts of thought disorder than those with unimpaired eye tracking, all psychotic patients, regardless of diagnostic class, tended to have thought disorder scores in the pathological range, as measured by the Thought Disorder Index. Although the data may be viewed as supporting similar hypothetical processes that underlie pursuit dysfunctions and thought disorder, the greater likelihood exists that the coupling of thought disorder and eye-tracking dysfunctions may be explained differently in the schizophrenia and in the major affective disorders.\r"

Schizophrenics had decreased sleep continuity comparable to delusional depressives. Slow-wave sleep percent was similar to that seen in healthy controls, as was the intranight temporal distribution of EEG delta activity. However, schizophrenics showed diminished delta counts per minute of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and a decreased total delta wave count. In contrast, depressives showed diminished slow-wave sleep percent compared with controls, greatly decreased delta activity (more so than did the schizophrenics), and an altered temporal distribution of delta activity, as evidenced by a shift of delta activity from the first to the second NREM period. Minutes of slow-wave sleep in the schizophrenics was inversely correlated with the severity of negative symptoms independent of the effects of age and the presence of depression. The schizophrenics showed normal REM latency and first REM period duration, in contrast to the depressives. These findings, reviewed in the historical context of sleep physiologic studies of schizophrenia over the past 30 years, suggest that young, never-medicated schizophrenics do not show the characteristic constellation of abnormalities in the first NREM-REM cycle seen in patients with major depression. However, decreased slow-wave sleep should be investigated as a possible marker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia.\r"

All patients were medication free, and REM latency was explicitly defined using both strict and lenient criteria. Chronically ill paranoid or undifferentiated schizophrenics could not be distinguished from patients with major depressive disorder or schizoaffective disorder using any definition of REM latency. These results were not due to longer REM latency in the particular sample of patients with major depressive disorder. They had abnormally low REM latencies; however, the schizophrenic patients showed similar decrements. These data cast serious doubt on the specificity of short REM latency as a biological marker for major depressive disorder.\r"

No significant group differences were found for first rapid eye movement (REM) period latency, REM density, or any other REM sleep measures. Age correlated significantly with REM latency and delta sleep time, especially among depressive patients. No significant correlations between sleep measures and severity of illness were found.

  ".W": "We studied cervical tissue from 20 patients with a variety of condylomatous, preneoplastic, and neoplastic lesions to detect various subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) at the molecular level by DNA hybridization. In addition, mirror image biopsy specimens were studied by an immunoperoxidase technique for the presence of HPV structural antigens, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and involucrin, as markers of disturbed maturation and/or neoplasia. Of the 20 patients studied, we were able to demonstrate the presence of either HPV 16 or 18, or both, in three of seven squamous carcinomas tested, and three of five dysplasias. Interestingly, two cases of squamous carcinoma and one moderate dysplasia demonstrated HPV types 6 and 11 concurrently with HPV 16 and/or 18. Four of six condylomas showed HPV subtypes 6/11, and only one condyloma showed weak hybridization with HPV 18. Human papillomavirus structural antigen was seen in three of eight condylomas, and three of five dysplasias, but not in any carcinoma. All condylomas showed intense staining for involucrin in full-thickness of the epithelium, but the high-grade dysplasias and carcinomas showed only focal or absence of staining for involucrin. Carcinoembryonic antigen was expressed in 50% of the carcinomas with a pattern similar to that seen with involucrin, but did not correlate with any particular subtype of HPV. The molecular hybridization method seems to be superior for the detection of HPV lesions, and possibly for the prediction of their biologic behavior.\r"

These included 35 cases of fibrocystic disease, 16 cases of sclerosing adenosis, 24 cases of papilloma and papillomatosis, 43 intraduct carcinomas, and four intralobular carcinomas. In fibrocystic disease, S100 protein was demonstrable in large amounts in cells between the duct lining cells and the basement membrane of the ducts, being most pronounced in those exhibiting adenosis. Areas of epitheliosis showed scattered positive cells within the ducts with more strongly positive cells around these ducts. Apocrine metaplasia was moderately positive. No S100 protein was demonstrable in the epithelial lining cells of cysts or within the stroma. In sclerosing adenosis individual cells and groups of cells in the fibrous tissue were strongly positive. In papillomatosis and papilloma, the vascular core and epithelium failed to stain, but a discontinuous layer of cells between the epithelium and basement membrane was positive. In intraduct and intralobular carcinoma the tumor cells were uniformly negative, and wherever fibrocystic disease was also present, S100 protein was variably demonstrable. The study corroborated the view that fibrocystic disease and benign proliferative processes of the breast appear to contain cells that correspond to myoepithelial cells, and suggests that S100 protein may serve as a useful marker in the separation of benign proliferative breast lesions from in situ carcinoma.\r"

Aside from their young age, another unusual feature of these cases was that each woman had been pregnant and had a normal delivery, three and four months prior to diagnosis. A literature search revealed only 35 reported cases of multiple myeloma at or before the age of 30 years. Of these, only 14 were thought to be clear-cut or highly suggestive of myeloma by the authors. The relationship of multiple myeloma and pregnancy is discussed. Although the number of cases is small, the occurrence of myeloma in the younger individual does not appear to impart a worse prognosis or survival.\r"

In a review of all hospital and necropsied deaths from 1962 to 1981 in adult patients at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, it was found that 7393 hospital patients died and 4122 underwent necropsy (56%), with similar proportions in both men and women. The mean age of those undergoing necropsy was slightly younger: 60 years vs 62 years in men and 57 years vs 59 years in women. The proportion of necropsies performed was relatively similar for whites (57%) and nonwhites (51%). Although the large sample size made all these differences \"statistically significant,\" there were no clinically relevant differences with regard to gender, age, or race. These findings confirm a previous study at another institution and suggest that a demographic bias does not distort necropsy population data compared with data of the population of hospital deaths.\r"

We describe multifocal adenomatous change with severe dysplasia of the gallbladder in a young woman known to have familial adenomatous polyposis coli.

We determined the upper reference limits for serum lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase for approximately 8000 adult men and women believed to be in good health. Using a technique described here, we believe that the results can be transformed to user-specific units, and that the large data base can be applied to the many diverse enzyme methods in current use. With these data, enzyme survey participants will be able to estimate appropriate reference intervals for their particular method.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of muscle testing at various ages based on clinical impressions of therapists; and to determine how the stability of measurements over time varies with age and muscle tested. A total of 3,084 examinations were performed on 825 children with meningomyelocele. Therapists coded the degree of accuracy of the last 1,282 examinations. Of these patients 177 with six or more serial examinations were studied by generating Spearman rank order correlation coefficients for comparison of strength measurements at given ages with median strengths during five-year follow-up periods. The percentages of patients who had examinations at a given age equal to, and within one grade of individual best estimates of ultimate muscle strength were also calculated. It was concluded that: therapists are markedly more confident about assessments in children five years and older; stability of muscle testing measurements over time generally increases from birth to age five or six when peak stability is approached; the probability that a single muscle test precisely predicts future muscle strength varies with age and muscle tested; and the probability that a muscle test will predict future strength to within one grade is not strongly influenced by age or muscle tested.\r"

No significant correlation was found between time spent in sports participation and number of medical complications, rehospitalizations, functional status, or employment. Subsequently, subgroups of SCI wheelchair basketball players (n = 19) and SCI nonathletes (n = 19) were compared in medical, functional, and vocational status. The athlete group showed significantly more average time per week of sports participation (p less than 0.03), as expected. Fewer physician visits (p less than 0.01) occurred in the athlete group. Trends toward fewer medical complications and fewer rehospitalizations were seen in the athletic group, but this did not reach statistical significance. Sports participation was not associated with increased risk of medical complications and did not limit available time for vocational pursuits. The positive benefits of sports involvement on the community reintegration process and the acquisition of functional skills for the newly disabled warrant further study. The long-term impact of sports involvement on prevention of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other associated risks of a sedentary existence demands attention in our aging SCI population.\r"

A study was undertaken to determine typical orofacial electromyographic patterns and swallowing frequencies of normal children and children with cerebral palsy with oral involvement who do, and who do not drool, as well as to determine the correlation between swallowing frequency and drooling rate.

The MMD group scored significantly higher on the MMPI Depression scale, the IPAT Depression Test, and the SPS Hopelessness subscale, than the CON or SCI groups. Conversely, the MMD group showed lower levels of positive mental health than these two groups on the MMPI Ego Strength and CPI Well-Being scale scores. The MMD group did not differ significantly from the LGS group in any of the five measures. A definite tendency toward depression was evident among MMD patients. A similar tendency was noted in the small LGS group. The progressive and disabling nature of the disease appears to be the major reason for depression in MMD patients. Our data do not support the concept that depression is an intrinsic characteristic of MMD.\r"

Seven persons with paraplegia with lesions ranging from T-3 to L-1 and one bilateral amputee each performed four exercise tests to volitional exhaustion, on separate days, utilizing four modes of exercise. These included wheelchair exercise on a treadmill and arm exercise using a Monark arm ergometer (MAE), a CUBE, or an SAE. Peak values for oxygen consumption, heart rate, and blood lactate were similar during each type of exercise. Significant (p less than 0.05) differences were observed only in the peak values for minute ventilation (CUBE greater than MAE, SAE greater than MAE). The similarity of the maximal responses observed in this study indicates that the CUBE and SAE are comparable to TM exercise and to the MAE in assessing the aerobic capacity of wheelchair-confined subjects.\r"

Their walking performance at the end of the program was assessed and compared with the test findings. They had a history and rest electrocardiogram (ECG) examination which revealed cardiac problems in 75% of the patients. The exercise test was performed on a specially designed arm ergometer permitting coordinated exercise of arm and trunk muscles. Cardiac condition was judged by the achieved peak heart rate (mean 125 +/- 3.8 beats per minute) and observed ECG abnormalities. In only three patients exercise-induced ECG abnormalities were found at peak workload. The mean peak workload was 52 +/- 1.9W. It was concluded from these results that the average physical and cardiac condition is poor in vascular leg amputees. In 34 patients (87%) the prosthetic training was successful. Fourteen patients needed a walking frame and twenty could walk without a walking frame. The probability of achieving walking without a walking frame was 70% in patients with peak workload above 45W and 30% in those with peak workload lower than 45W.\r"

Nine of the 19 above-knee amputees were hypertensive (p = 0.05) and obese by hydrostatic weighing (p less than 0.001). Obesity was strongly associated with hypertension, decreased glucose tolerance, and marked hyperinsulinemia.

Gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes and indwelling catheters were eventually removed from many patients. Electronic devices were used by ten patients to facilitate communication. We conclude that rehabilitation and medical care must be planned carefully, given the length of survival shown in this group.\r"

Analysis showed an abnormality in the vertical force (Fz) component, the second peak being significantly reduced in size, with asymmetry in the duration of the stance phase. These abnormalities were also reflected in the stance phase and in the angular changes in the knee. Similar analyses should be helpful in following the progress of the disease.\r"

The teflon coating of the TECA monopolar needles MG37 and MF37, commonly used in clinical electromyography, was progressively denuded to increase the length of the recording tip to 2, 3, 5, and 10 times the normal exposure, with resultant increase in the area of the recording portion. Low threshold MUPs obtained on minimal contraction from the tibialis anterior were analyzed for amplitude, duration, area, phases, turns, peak duration, and index. The amplitude and area of the MUP showed the most change, both decreasing with progressive denudation. The number of turns and phases were also reduced, more for the MF than for the MG needle. Duration, peak duration, and index showed insignificant changes. These findings give further support to the use of duration for representation of the MUP, since this is the most stable parameter even under poor recording conditions.\r"

This study sought to more clearly define late-onset, postpolio muscular weakness--age of onset, symptoms, and severity--and to determine whether people might benefit from environmental modification, respiratory aids, and orthoses. A total of 183 postpolio patients were examined by a physician and completed a questionnaire on their ambulatory status and related musculoskeletal and respiratory symptoms. Of those participating in the study, 154 claimed to be experiencing late deterioration in strength. The syndrome included decreased endurance, more limited ambulation, and increased weakness in the previously affected limb/s. For those describing late-onset weakness, average ages were determined for the onset of polio (8.3 years), the onset of postpolio muscular weakness (42.3 years), and the latent period of stable functioning (34.8 years). Patients claimed to have experienced a new, lower level of strength for an average of 4.7 years. All 33 patients who had undergone muscle transfer surgery were experiencing late-onset weakness in that extremity. Fasciculations (51%) and long-bone fractures secondary to falls (21%) were common sleep disturbances occurred frequently (31%) even in those without prior bulbar involvement. Upper motor neuron signs were present in only one case. Bracing was rare (16%) and the braces used were usually old. The subjects did not report a steadily or rapidly progressive decline, but rather described a steplike decrement with long plateaus. The population described losses in strength that had significant bearing on functional status and general health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report a patient who experienced severe right shoulder discomfort three weeks prior to hospital admission which evolved to include both shoulders. Two weeks prior to admission he noticed the onset of discomfort in breathing in the supine position and shortness of breath with minor exertion. The admitting diagnoses were myocardial infarction due to significant ECG changes and idiopathic elevated bilateral hemidiaphragms. The patient had findings significant for tachypnea, dyspnea, decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, impaired motion of the bilateral lung bases on inspiration and paradoxical respirations. Comprehensive medical testing and evaluation revealed bilateral elevated hemidiaphragms and vital capacity 40% of normal. Weakness of the proximal shoulder girdle and bicep musculature bilaterally was noted. Electromyography was significant for reduced recruitment pattern in the bilateral shoulder girdle musculature. Nerve conduction studies suggested bilateral phrenic neuropathy. This case is an unusual presentation of brachial neuritis affecting the bilateral shoulder girdle with phrenic nerve involvement. The differential diagnosis of acute shoulder pain associated with respiratory symptomatology should therefore include brachial neuritis.\r"

The Vignos scale is accepted for LE function and the Brooke scale for UE evaluation. The assumption that UE functional loss parallels LE loss has never been tested. Furthermore, there are no studies examining the relationship between UE/LE strength. This study tests the hypothesis that UE/LE strength and functional losses are parallel in DMD and other neuromuscular disorders. Vignos grades, Brooke grades, and manual muscle test scores were determined for 27 patients with DMD, 10 patients with fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSH), 24 patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy (MMD) and 29 patients with other (Becker's dystrophy and limb-girdle syndrome) proximal myopathies (PM). Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for UE vs LE functional grade and strength scores and subjected to significance analysis. While all correlations were statistically significantly different from zero (p less than 0.01), all were also significantly different from one (p less than 0.01), none representing perfect equivalence. Coefficients of determination indicated that a maximum of 86% (FSH) of variation in UE rank could be explained purely by observing LE rank. While there is a significant relationship between UE/LE strength and functional grade, these measurements were not found to be entirely equivalent. Therefore, while measures of lower body function or strength might be used as a substitute for UE measurements in drug trials in which global effects are expected, the two measurements are not equivalent when evaluating an individual's clinical status.\r"

These effects were investigated by continuously infusing rats with saline or the chemotaxin formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Rats that sustained a full-thickness burn covering 30% of total body surface area and whose wounds were inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a significantly shorter survival when FMLP was infused (6.5 +/- 0.91 days) than did saline-infused rats (9.9 +/- 0.83 days). Rats infused with FMLP had significantly more leukocytes in their burn wounds, significantly fewer PMNs in the circulating pool, and the same number of PMNs at the site of FMLP infusion compared with the saline-treated group. These findings support the hypothesis that chemotaxins generated by tissue injury or sepsis contribute to increased susceptibility to infection.\r"

The results were compared with two data banks derived from either victims of multiple trauma without sepsis or surgical patients with early bacterial or fungal sepsis. Statistically significant differences between the patients and the nonseptic reference group were noted for cardiac index, total peripheral resistance, arteriovenous oxygen content difference, oxygen consumption, and levels of triglycerides, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, alpha-aminobutyrate, and alanine. No such differences were present for these data compared with the septic reference group. Physiologic data obtained just before death in three patients indicated a failure of oxygen transport. It appears that the systemic septic response to viral agents is indistinguishable by physiologic and metabolic criteria from that resulting from bacterial or fungal agents.\r"

On days 1 through 10 thereafter, the proliferative responses of the splenocytes to concanavalin A were measured and allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction was performed. The proliferative responses to mitogen stimulation as well as the results of mixed lymphocyte reaction studies indicated that marked immunosuppression occurred at day 1. Immunosuppression persisted for at least five days following hemorrhage, as evidenced by mitogen stimulation assay. Another group of mice was subjected to sepsis three days after hemorrhage and resuscitation. The mortalities in the sham-hemorrhage and hemorrhage groups following sepsis were 58% and 100%, respectively. Thus, a significant depression of cellular immunity occurred following simple hemorrhage despite adequate resuscitation, and this immunosuppression enhanced the susceptibility to sepsis.\r"

The CRP assays were carried out using an automated laser nephelometer system after the patient's discharge from the hospital. Forty-six septic complications were diagnosed in 40 patients. These complications consisted of wound infection (23), urinary tract infection (11), pneumonia (six), upper respiratory tract infection (three), intra-abdominal abscess (one), and other (two). The CRP testing was found to have a positive predictive value of 69% and a negative predictive value of 78%.

Rats were fed either a standard rat chow (6.8 g of tyrosine per kilogram of chow), which supports normal growth, fertility, and longevity, or the same chow supplemented with 10 g of tyrosine per kilogram of chow. Seven days later, the rats underwent cecal ligation and perforation while under intraperitoneal pentobarbital anesthesia. There was a significant increase in survival in the tyrosine-supplemented group. Similarly, in another experiment, tyrosine-supplemented rats were able to tolerate acute fulminant hemorrhagic shock better than were nonsupplemented control animals.\r"

This factor, active at a pH of 5.5 but not at 7.4, had similar inhibitory characteristics as the Bacteroides metabolite succinic acid. We examined the kinetics of production of this inhibitory factor and correlated its presence with succinic acid concentrations in the culture filtrate. In the four to six hours after Bacteroides fragilis 9032 reached the stationary phase of growth, there was a large increase in succinic acid production with an accompanying reduction in culture pH. This correlated well with the generation of a leukocyte-inhibitory factor. Pure succinic acid in sterile culture medium at concentrations similar to those detected in the 18-hour culture filtrate (20 mmol/L) produced comparable reduction in PMN migration. Following gel filtration chromatography of B fragilis culture filtrate, the fractions containing succinic acid labeled with carbon 14 inhibited PMN migration.\r"

In all specimens, one or more of the following abnormal findings were made: bizarre giant mitochondria; intramitochondrial paracrystalline inclusions; disorganization of the lamellar structure of rough endoplasmic reticulum; increased numbers of smooth endoplasmic reticulum; and/or parasinusoidal fibrosis. Above all, paracrystalline inclusions appeared to be a highly specific finding in ALS. In light of the above pathologic findings, we evaluated the liver function tests of 37 patients (including the above-mentioned 21 patients) with ALS, and found a high incidence of mild liver dysfunction. In spite of its subtleness, these ultrastructural changes of hepatocytes were consistently found in such patients, and offer further insight into the intrahepatic metabolic abnormalities in ALS.\r"

Results from an analysis of questionnaire data on ages at onset and death, sex of the affected parent, and motor disorder in 624 patients gave no evidence of discrete phenotypes, as suggested in the literature. The tendency for muscular rigidity (instead of chorea), an accelerated natural history and paternal transmission, each of which is often associated with the juvenile-onset form of HD, is inversely related to age at onset in the affected child. The most parsimonious explanation for clinical variability in HD is that all HD types are part of a continuum, although expression of the juvenile form may be partly determined by a maternally transmitted factor. Evidence for accelerated aging in HD and correlations between age at onset and death in patients with HD and longevity in their unaffected relatives warrant further investigation into the relationship between aging and phenotypic expression of HD.\r"

Computed tomographic scans were evaluated for the presence or absence of white matter lucencies, termed leuko-araiosis. These are defined as patchy or diffuse areas of decreased attenuation involving only white matter and with no change in adjacent ventricles or sulci. The nine controls with leuko-araiosis had lower scores on the ESD than the 96 controls without leuko-araiosis (mean ESD with leuko-araiosis, 227.1 +/- 14; without leuko-araiosis, 237.1 +/- 8), and the difference remains significant even after adjusting for the possible confounding effects of age, sex, education, and infarct detected on computed tomography. Significant differences were also found comparing subjects with leuko-araiosis and those without in respect to abnormal gait, limb power, plantar response, and the rooting and palmomental reflexes. Leuko-araiosis may represent a marker for early dementia. The pathophysiology of this finding remains uncertain. Our results suggest that white matter abnormalities play a role in the development of intellectual impairment in the elderly.\r"

Thirty-nine of the 113 patients studied (ischemic score, less than or equal to 4) were found to have leuko-araiosis, which we have defined as patchy or diffuse lucencies in the white matter. Patients with leuko-araiosis had significantly lower mean scores on the ESD, 109.7 +/- 61.2, compared with mean scores of 148.5 +/- 78.0 in those without. However, only a trend toward lower scores on the ESD was observed when age, sex, education, and infarct were taken into account in the analysis of covariance. Leuko-araiosis was found to be associated with increasing age, hypertension, abnormalities of power in the limbs, and extensor-plantar responses in this sample of patients. In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone, diagnosed clinically, 29 out of 91 demonstrated leuko-araiosis on computed tomography, but scores on the ESD in this group overall were not significantly different when those with and without leuko-araiosis were compared. In less advanced cases, however, a highly significant trend was evident for leuko-araiosis to be associated with increased dementia in AD. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that leuko-araiosis is associated with dementia in AD, and that this is either most marked or most easily identifiable before the dementia becomes very severe.\r"

These results are similar to those described for patients treated with intrathecal beta-interferon. The mechanism of the prolonged beneficial effect is unknown, but is unlikely to represent antiviral activity in the central nervous system, and more probably involves systemic immunoregulatory functions.

New daily-wear polymacon lenses (38.6% water content) and extended-wear lidofilcon A lenses (70% water content) were exposed to a suspension of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter of P aeruginosa for 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Increasing numbers of bacteria were found to attach to the lenses with time, and no significant differences between CL types were demonstrated. Attachment was considered to be irreversible since washing did not remove the bacteria. We conclude that P aeruginosa can actively attach to new, unworn hydrogel CLs.\r"

Toxic stromal keratitis occurred in five eyes because of impurities on the lenticules. Fibrosis appeared around the implant in five eyes. Two eyes showed aseptic necrosis of the inferior cornea with extrusion of the implant, attributed to exposure keratitis. Complications during surgery included faulty microkeratome incisions (three eyes) and epithelial implantation in the lamellar bed (one eye). Three lenticules decentered, one extruding through the wound, probably because the monkeys rubbed their eyes excessively. Nine of the 11 eyes with postoperative refraction data showed overcorrection or undercorrection of more than 1.00 diopter. Most of these complications could have been prevented by better technique, design, and manufacture of the lenticule or cooperation of the subjects.\r"

The procedure utilizes an automated trephine, designated the \"trabecuphine,\" that is capable of simultaneous cutting and irrigation. The trabecuphine is brought into the anterior chamber through a limbal incision 180 degrees away from the planned filter site. The trephine is passed across the anterior chamber, above the iris, and into the angle to perform the sclerotomy. This procedure was performed successfully in 13 eyes of seven cynomolgus monkeys. Complications included two small hyphemas that cleared completely. Other complications such as flat anterior chamber, corneal damage, iridodialysis, conjunctival buttonhole, and cataract formation did not occur. Internal scleral trephination may offer another alternative in the surgical management of patients with intractable glaucoma.\r"

Multiple regression analysis of the outcome in one eye from each of 411 patients disclosed that the diameter of the central clear zone, patient age, and depth of the incision scar were the major factors affecting the change in refraction one year after surgery. Preoperative factors examined that did not have a significant influence on the outcome were sex, average central keratometric power, corneal thickness, corneal diameter, intraocular pressure, and ocular rigidity. The predictability of radial keratotomy, ie, the precision with which the outcome can be estimated, was measured by the 90% confidence interval for the change in refraction based on the regression equation. The width of this interval within each clear zone group was as follows: 4.0 mm, 2.49 diopters; 3.5 mm, 3.38 D; 3.0 mm, 4.12 D. For all 411 eyes, the 90% confidence interval was approximately 3.50 D wide. Thus, the surgeon could be 90% certain that an individual patient's refraction would be within 1.75 D of the predicted value one year after surgery.\r"

Minimal reductions in kinetic scan times were present for stimulus velocities above 4 degrees/s. All targets appeared to have reductions in sensitivity at velocities above 4 degrees/s (target detection occurring at more central visual field locations) that were presumably related to the observers' reaction times. There were no consistent differences in the variability of kinetic thresholds for different stimulus velocities. When all factors were considered, a stimulus velocity of 4 degrees/s seemed to be optimal for kinetic scans of all targets in the central and peripheral visual field.\r"

In the rheumatoid joint, natural killer (NK) cell activity is reduced in comparison with that in the peripheral blood (PB). We examined the ability of SF NK cells to modulate the spontaneous production of Ig in RA SF, and we contrasted this with the activity in PB from RA patients and from normal subjects. We found that the spontaneous production of IgG was greater in RA SF than in RA or normal PB. The baseline NK activity was significantly lower in RA SF than in RA or normal PB (P less than 0.005). Incubation with anti-Leu-11b and complement reduced NK activity in PB, but not in SF, and it significantly (P less than or equal to 0.021) increased IgG production in both RA SF and RA PB. Lysis of NK cells in this manner also resulted in a significant increase (P less than 0.02) in IgM production in RA SF. These results suggest that NK cells with a Leu-11b phenotype down-regulate the ongoing synthesis of IgG and IgM in the rheumatoid joint.\r"

The RA patients showed elevated scores on these scales, and these results are similar to those reported in each of 6 published studies. The elevated MMPI scale scores can be explained largely by 5 \"disease-related\" MMPI statements which met 2 criteria: they were among 11 of the 117 MMPI statements that two-thirds of rheumatologists predicted would be RA-associated; and RA patients and normal subjects differed significantly in their responses to these statements. The responses of RA patients and normal subjects to most other statements in the MMPI Hypochondriasis, Depression, and Hysteria scales were quite similar. In RA patients, responses to \"disease-related\" statements were correlated with results of measures of disease activity, which indicates that responses to these MMPI items reflect the severity, as well as the presence, of RA. These findings suggest that new criteria are needed for validation of the MMPI as a clinical tool for the recognition of hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria in a patient who has RA.\r"

  ".W": "The generation of polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) superoxide ion (O2-) by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals may be important in the pathogenesis of acute gout. Coating MSU crystals with IgG prior to exposure to PMN markedly augmented O2- generation. This augmentation was inhibited by supernates, termed cell lysate, derived from sonicated PMN or PMN exposed to MSU crystals for 5 hours at 37 degrees C. Lysate was effective in inhibiting O2- production when incubated with MSU crystals prior to, during, or after MSU crystals were exposed to IgG. No IgG could be eluted from crystals exposed to both lysate and IgG. Immunoelectron microscopy showed virtually no IgG on crystal surfaces after incubation of crystals with lysate and IgG. These data suggest that products of PMN injury can modulate further PMN responses to MSU crystals. This phenomenon provides a negative feedback loop and is one possible mechanism for the self-limitation of acute gouty attacks.\r"

Fifty-eight percent of these asymptomatic patients had MSU crystals in their knee joints. Serum uric acid levels, serum creatinine levels, volume of synovial fluid aspirated, and cell counts of the aspirated fluid did not differentiate the MSU crystal-positive group from the group without MSU crystals. Clinical factors such as alcohol abuse, coronary heart disease, hypertension, duration of gout, duration of the intercritical period, and drug therapy did not differentiate the 2 groups. Nineteen patients consented to aspiration of their other knee. Seven of these patients (37%) had MSU crystals bilaterally, and 6 patients (32%) had them unilaterally. The implications of the persistence of MSU crystals (including those in intracellular locations) in many patients, despite normalization of serum uric acid levels, should be determined. Knee joint aspiration is a sensitive method for the demonstration of MSU crystals in asymptomatic patients. The procedure might also be useful in documenting these crystals in patients who have had attacks of arthritis with features consistent with a diagnosis of gout, but in whom MSU crystals have not been documented.\r"

Horseradish peroxidase-labeled nerve terminal fields were observed in the ipsilateral respiratory subnuclei of the nucleus of the solitary tract. This may represent the sensory pathway by which the degree of middle ear aeration is monitored by the brain. Horseradish peroxidase was injected into the eustachian tube muscles in six of the monkeys, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled motoneurons were observed in the ipsilateral trigeminal motor nucleus (tensor palati muscle) and nucleus ambiguus (levator palati muscle). These brain-stem motor nuclei may represent the efferent pathways by which the degree of middle ear aeration is regulated. The results of these primate experiments confirm our earlier studies on rabbits and cats. A theory for the neural control of middle ear aeration is proposed.\r"

The postoperative hearing results as determined by the airbone gap were comparable with those obtained with alloplastic materials (mean gap, 18.6 dB). No extrusions occurred; an analysis of hearing after three years showed that 96.7% of the initial hearing improvement was maintained in 51 ears available for study.

A single dose of ipratropium bromide (400 micrograms) caused a 73% reduction of cold air-induced rhinorrhea and a 66% reduction of hot soup-induced rhinorrhea. It is concluded that a major part of the nasal discharge induced by these stimuli is reflex-mediated, and consequently may be treated by a cholinoceptor antagonist, such as ipratropium.\r"

Qualitative analysis of olfactory dysfunction by an Odorant Confusion Matrix helps to characterize more fully sense of smell in the dysosmic patient. It is well grounded in psychophysical theory, thereby permitting physiological inferences about specific neural dysfunctions. The quantitative measure derived from the matrix correlates well with another quantitative measure of olfactory ability, the Smell identification Test, and provides the opportunity for valid comparisons among and within patients. Examination of illustrative case reports demonstrates that the qualitative features of the Odorant Confusion Matrix offer additional insights to support etiologic diagnoses of disturbances in sense of smell.\r"

A needle catheter was used to infuse the radioactive xenon into a continuous flow of room air maintained through the model by a variable vacuum source connected to the nasopharynx. The radioactive gas was infused at one of five release sites in the nostril, and the distribution of the radioactivity was imaged in the sagittal plane with a scintillation camera. The data were organized to show the activity in six contiguous regions of the midnose. For each catheter, release site activity patterns were determined for three flow rates. The results of this experiment showed that both catheter position and flow rate had significant and reproducible effects on the distribution of radioactivity within the model.\r"

Conservative septoplastic techniques through Cottle's approach produce an untolerably high rate of recurrence or insufficient restoration of the function of the nose. The total septal reconstruction through decortication (external) approach is proposed as a solution for this problem. After temporary elevation of the skin, the nasal septum is approached in between the lower lateral cartilages. The mucoperichondrium is elevated, and the entire septal cartilage is removed. The straight part of the cartilage from the central part is used to reconstruct the ventrocaudal and ventrocranial septum, while the deformed cartilage is straightened by crushing and positioned in the posterior septal space. The cartilage graft is precisely sutured to the upper lateral cartilages and to the fibers of the septospinal ligament. In an eight-year period, five girls and 19 boys, aged 5 to 14 years, were operated on using this technique. Satisfactory functional results were obtained without any major complications in all patients. There were neither serious alterations of the growth of the nose, nor the necessity for reoperation. Total septal reconstruction through decortication (external) approach is useful for correction of severe septal deformities in children.\r"

It has been postulated that a one-way valve between the nasal cavity and the affected sinus leads to increased antral pressure and sinus expansion after nose blowing. By monitoring antral pressure through a transoral puncture, we demonstrated a one-way valve between the nose and the maxillary antrum. To our knowledge, this is the first verification of the trap-valve hypothesis.\r"

Experimental work in dogs demonstrates clear functional differences between colon and jejunum as free esophageal grafts.

A scoring system was used to identify regional damage on left ventriculograms. Forty two patients were classified as having good left ventricular function and 66 as having varying degrees of impairment. Apart from a history of myocardial infarction, the only variables discriminating between those with good and those with impaired left ventricular function were the area of distribution of the artery beyond the occlusion and cigarette smoking. Hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, family history of vascular disease, diabetes, obesity, duration of angina, age, and presence of identifiable collaterals were not discriminators. Smoking was itself significantly associated with a history of infarction; but after controlling for this, smoking exerted a significant additional effect on the amount of left ventricular damage. It is concluded that smoking is not only a risk factor for myocardial infarction in patients with single left anterior descending artery occlusion, but that it is also a major factor in determining the extent of associated left ventricular damage.\r"

In the group as a whole, stenosis of greater than 50% by diameter was caused by concentric fibrous plaques in 48% of lesions, by concentric lipid plaques in 28%, by eccentric fibrous plaques in 12%, and by eccentric lipid plaques in 12%. In addition, 43 of the 54 patients had one or more stenoses with multiple channels (recanalisation). Eccentric plaques with an arc of normal vessel wall occupying more than 16% of the circumference of the residual lumen were considered to have a vasospastic potential and made up 15% of all lesions with stenosis of greater than 50% by diameter. Forty four per cent of plaques causing stenosis between 30% and 50% by diameter were eccentric and retained a considerable arc of normal media. These lesions were often in series with segments of higher grade stenosis that did not have an arc of normal media. The overall frequency of plaque types gave no indication of the proportions of different plaque types within an individual. In 15% of patients all the plaques causing greater than 50% diameter stenosis were fibrous and in 13% of patients all the plaques were of the lipid type. Most patients had mixtures of all plaque types in varying proportions. Plaques with a large pool of lipid were not found in 33% of patients whereas they formed greater than 90% of the plaques in 9% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring with a transducer tipped catheter and simultaneous frequency modulated electrocardiograms was used to assess changes in left ventricular function in five male patients (mean age 51.8 years) during variant angina; four patients had coronary artery stenosis and one had normal coronary arteries. Two hundred and seventy hours of ambulatory recordings were analysed. Twenty episodes (12 painful, 8 silent) of ST segment change greater than 1 mm occurred. Episodes tended to occur more frequently in the early morning hours. Six episodes of painful ST elevation were associated with a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. In the remaining episodes ST segment elevation was of shorter duration and there was no rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. Pain was usually a late feature. Silent ST segment elevation occurred at rest and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increased in all but one episode. Silent exertional ST segment depression was associated with a greater increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure than that seen during ST segment elevation. ST segment depression preceded or followed ST segment elevation in two episodes. The onset of ST segment elevation nearly always preceded the onset of a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. Ergometrine maleate provocation produced a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure in three patients. In one there was no response to 1000 micrograms but spontaneous episodes of ST segment elevation were recorded during ambulatory monitoring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixty seven episodes of ST segment depression (greater than 1 mm) were recorded. Thirty five were accompanied by pain of which six occurred at night; in 34 pulmonary artery diastolic pressure rose significantly. In all but two of the 32 episodes of painless ST segment depression (four of which were at night) there was a significant rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. No such rise was found in six normal subjects during exertion. ST segment changes tended to occur before (24 episodes) or at the same time (27 episodes) as changes in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. ST segment depression followed an increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure in only 13 episodes. The times to maximum ST depression and maximum pulmonary artery diastolic pressure rise were similar. Painful and painless ST segment depression could not be distinguished on the basis of the configuration of the ST segment or in terms of the changes in the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure.\r"

It is distinguished by two palpable pulsations, the second of which is diastolic and immediately follows the second heart sound. In the course of open chest canine studies of the second heart sound, micromanometers and an electromagnetic flow meter were used to study proximal aortic haemodynamic function in both strong and weak beats. It was found that the incisural notch of the aortic pressure signal is not strongly dependent on the extent of left ventricular ejection, and is of essentially normal amplitude even in beats having greatly reduced aortic flow. In contrast, the magnitude of the systolic upstroke of the aortic pressure pulse is strongly determined by the magnitude of left ventricular ejection and is considerably reduced in weak beats. With low cardiac output the relative size of the incisural notch becomes exaggerated in comparison with the overall pulsation, thus creating the characteristic M shaped waveform of the dicrotic pulse.\r"

Six patients had an appreciable left ventricular outflow tract gradient and six did not. The drug reduced myocardial oxygen consumption in proportion to a reduction in the development of left ventricular pressure. The negative inotropic effect of verapamil was counteracted by the drug's non-specific vasodilator activity, so that cardiac index was unaltered at any heart rate and as a result myocardial efficiency was unaffected by the drug. Verapamil did not consistently alter myocardial metabolism. Some patients showed improvement in anaerobic myocardial metabolism after verapamil but an equal number showed impairment of lactate metabolism. It was not possible to predict from clinical features, echocardiographic findings, or haemodynamic variables measured before administration of verapamil which patients would demonstrate haemodynamic or metabolic improvement after the drug. In this short term study no mechanism was demonstrated by which patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might obtain a consistent improvement from treatment with verapamil.\r"

The QT interval of the electrocardiogram and the duration of the monophasic action potential of the right ventricle were measured. QT interval is a function of action potential duration; the two variables were very closely correlated in this study. Both these variables increased in duration with increasing test pulse interval. A biphasic response, as previously reported, was not seen. An increase in steady state pacing frequency caused QT interval and action potential duration to decrease for any given R-R interval. When frequency of stimulation was suddenly increased and then maintained, there was an immediate action potential shortening followed by a further more gradual shortening occurring over several minutes. These results imply that a simple correction of QT interval for heart rate (QTc) is inadequate. It is concluded that the relation between action potential duration (or QT interval) and heart rate depends on both the instantaneous interval between beats and the duration of the prevailing heart rate.\r"

In only 38 of the 42 with an important coarctation was an increased blood flow velocity from the distal arch demonstrated. In three with interruption of the aortic arch an increased velocity recorded from the region of the distal arch was thought to represent ductal flow. There was little difference between the peak to peak and instantaneous maximum gradients in the 20 patients with important coarctation in whom direct pressure measurements both proximal and distal to the obstruction were made at catheterisation. There were poor agreements between Doppler and measured peak to peak and instantaneous gradients in the 17 patients found to have both an increased velocity and important coarctation. It is concluded that although an increased blood flow velocity in the distal arch is usually demonstrated in coarctation this may not occur with severe obstruction. Furthermore, the maximum velocity is not related to the anatomical severity of the obstruction and the Doppler estimate of pressure drop in coarctation may not even reliably predict that measured at catheterisation.\r"

The Doppler examination was performed at the site of the aortic orifice in the parasternal short axis echocardiographic view and the method was based on the detection of the area of systolic flow through the stenotic orifice. This area was derived by planimetry and the measurements obtained by the Doppler method were compared with the aortic valve area calculated at catheterisation according to the Gorlin formula. The method was applicable in 41 of the 44 patients studied. The Doppler data were consistent with the haemodynamic measurements even in patients with decreased cardiac index. It is concluded that this new application of the flow mapping procedure is reliable and is easily applied to adult patients with a wide range of clinical conditions.\r"

Two hundred and twenty-four people (36.4%) had a spontaneous remission of at least one of their solar keratoses. A total of 485 lesions (25.9%) underwent spontaneous remission out of the 1873 lesions that were present at the first examination of these 224 people. There was no significant difference between the number of lesions present at the initial examination in those who had a spontaneous remission compared with those who did not. There was a 21.8% increase in the total number of solar keratoses in the 1040 people studied in the 12-month period, due to new lesions forming at the same time as remissions were occurring. The incidence rate of squamous cell carcinoma occurring in the people with solar keratoses was 0.24% for each solar keratosis present at the original examination. With a substantial proportion of solar keratoses remitting spontaneously, plus the low rate of malignant transformation and the low potential for metastasis to occur from squamous cell carcinoma arising in a solar keratosis, the rationale of treating all solar keratoses appears questionable.\r"

Although the total dose changed by a factor of four, the proportions of subjects sensitized were comparable (66, 50 and 55% respectively), and their degrees of reactivity were similar. This contrasts with previous findings that when the area of sensitization was fixed and the concentration was increased over a similar range, highly significant increases in the proportion of sensitized subjects and degree of reactivity occurred.\r"

To overcome this problem an effort has now been made to define the main terms used in this classification more precisely. To preserve continuity, the main structure of the original groupings has been retained; but the opportunity has been taken to adjust certain minor groups in conformity with recent ideas, and also to modify definitions to take into account the greatly improved prognosis for babies of very low birthweight. Otherwise, it is thought that subclassification of the main groups offers a better method of exploring new hypotheses than any radical alteration of the main groups themselves.\r"

Norethisterone, 2.5 or 5 mg daily, was given for 7 days and a placebo for two periods of 7 days. Psychological, behavioural and physical variables were assessed using the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. There were widespread adverse effects which were dose-related. Significant changes in five of the eight symptom complexes studied (pain, concentration, behavioural change, water retention and negative affect) were found with 5 mg/day of the progestogen. The symptoms were similar to the typical complaints of the premenstrual syndrome, such that a combination of oestradiol and testosterone implants with cyclical oral norethisterone appears to be a model for this condition. The dose of this progestogen should therefore be the minimum to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.\r"

We describe a series of patients with early or late onset pupillary capture and describe the pathogenesis. Early capture results from mechanical factors and is usually preventable. Late capture may be mechanical but is usually a sequel to the formation and subsequent contraction of iridocapsular synechiae. Synechiae result from lens epithelial or iris stromal hyperplasia and myofibroblastic metaplasia; they may be minimised by an atraumatic technique and adequate control of postoperative inflammation. The effect of pupillary capture is largely cosmetic, and we encountered no specific complications attributable to it.\r"

The case was diagnosed clinically as malignant melanoma and melanomalytic glaucoma, and the eye was enucleated. Routine histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructural studies revealed the tumour as being of the spindle cell type with extensive necrosis accompanied by a massive macrophagic response. The iridocorneal angle was heavily infiltrated by large pigmented cells, which were identified as being predominantly melanomacrophages. This is consistent with the few previous descriptions of this condition and confirms the view that the aqueous outflow obstruction is simply a mechanical process. Most of the native trabecular endothelial cells, which had also phagocytosed large quantities of melanin, still maintained their normal relationship to the trabeculae, though there were signs of activation. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed the presence of moderate numbers of tumour cells on the iris surface and in the trabecular meshwork distant from the primary tumour site. The importance of these findings to the management of anterior uveal melanomas with secondary open angle glaucoma is discussed.\r"

We have studied the surgical results and complications of these two tamponades and drawn preliminary conclusions on their use in retinal reattachment surgery. After a seven-month minimum follow-up 13 (68%) of the eyes have reattached retinas. Six (60%) of 10 eyes treated only with silicone have reattached retinas, and four (67%) of six eyes treated only with sulphur hexafluoride gas tamponade have reattached retinas. An additional three eyes treated initially with silicone oil subsequently developed retinal detachments; all were successfully reattached with sulphur hexafluoride tamponade after silicone oil removal. Intraoperative pneumatic retinal reattachment to assess relief of retinal traction combined with the production of widespread chorioretinal adhesions to wall off persistent anterior traction and detachment, as well as extended postoperative gas tamponade of the retina, appears to enhance the surgical results in retinal detachment complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Silicone oil tamponade of the retina appears to be useful in cases where retinal traction cannot be entirely relieved and in patients who are unable to tolerate the head positioning required for effective gas tamponade of the retina. A controlled clinical study recently begun will be required to define further the precise role of these methods of retinal tamponade.\r"

Patient marrow revealed an absence of recognizable granulocytic precursors; megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors were normal. The WBC count was 1800/mm3 on admission with only 2% neutrophils; the absolute neutrophil count first exceeded 500/mm3 on the 17th day following cessation of Chl. A serum Chl level on admission was 100 micrograms/mL (acute phase, AP); no Chl was detected in serum (convalescent phase, CP) assessed on the 22nd hospital day. Antineutrophil antibodies were not detected, and T cell depletion failed to augment patient in vitro granulopoiesis. Patient AP serum produced potent complement-mediated inhibition (87% +/- 7%) of autologous granulocyte progenitors (CFU-GM) with minimal inhibition of erythroid (11% +/- 5%) or multipotent (5% +/- 4%) progenitor cells. Selective inhibition by patient AP serum of CFU-GM (74% +/- 11%) was also seen against two allogeneic marrows. Patient CP serum no longer inhibited (6% +/- 4%) autologous CFU-GM. Addition of Chl (5 to 120 micrograms/mL) to CP serum but not to control serum resulted in potent drug concentration-dependent complement-mediated inhibition of autologous and allogeneic CFU-GM. Inhibition of CFU-GM in the presence of Chl was no longer demonstrable following immunoabsorbent removal of IgG from patient serum. Patient serum in the presence of Chl had limited activity against morphologically recognizable marrow granulocytic precursors in a microimmunofluorescence assay. These results are most consistent with the development of Chl-dependent, selective antibody-mediated immune inhibition of granulopoiesis.\r"

This study was undertaken to investigate whether erythropoietin (EP) production is adequate and whether the hemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) were affected during the course of infection. Groups of female Balb/c mice infected with Plasmodium vinckei vinckei, Plasmodium berghei, or Plasmodium chabaudi adami were exposed to five hours of simulated altitude equivalent to 22,000 ft. Plasma samples were collected for EP bioassay and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Using radioiron incorporation as an index of erythropoiesis, differences in response to infection with different species of plasmodia were observed. In general, decreases in erythropoietic activity were observed in bone marrow and spleen as the infection progressed and continued to be depressed after apparent resolution of a nonlethal infection with P. chabaudi adami. Marrow from infected and control femurs were tested for CFU-S content using the spleen colony assay. The cellularity and CFU-S content of the femoral marrow decrease as the parasitemia increases. All three species of plasmodia stimulate EP production during peak parasitemias, indicating that adequate amounts of EP are available to the erythron during malarial infection. Depletion of CFU-S and probable lack of compensatory turnover of CFU-S may contribute to the disease characteristics of malaria.\r"

The three experimental protocols were daily oral cyclosporine (Cs) treatment of recipients; in vitro ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation of donor platelets; and Cs-loading of donor platelets. All nine recipients of Cs, 11/12 (92%) recipients of UV-irradiated platelets, and 5/9 (56%) recipients of Cs-loaded donor platelets remained nonimmunized to repeated transfusions of donor platelets. In contrast, only 3 of 21 untreated controls (14%) were not alloimmunized by donor platelets. Moreover, 44% to 67% of the nonimmunized recipients remained tolerant to continued platelet transfusions from their original donor even after experimental therapy was discontinued. Forty-three percent to 100% of transfusions from secondary donors were also accepted without causing alloimmunization, suggesting that tolerance induced by prior treatment was not specific for the primary donor. However, survival of both the original and secondary donor platelets was reduced to about half the starting level, suggesting that some immune response to platelets had occurred. Also, recipients immunized by their original donor's platelets frequently developed refractoriness to platelets from other donors.\r"

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), H-25 and H-366, shown previously to react with human peripheral blood large granular lymphocytes with natural killer (NK) cell activity and some peripheral blood monocytes, have now been shown to also react with a significant proportion of the myeloid and erythroid precursor cells in human bone marrow and peripheral blood. In FACS IV cell sorting and immune rosetting of bone marrow cells, the antigens recognized by H-25 and H-366 were found to be expressed on most blasts and promyelocytes but sequentially fewer of the more mature cells of the myeloid lineage. Both antigens were also found on most monocytes but only a minor proportion of lymphoid and nucleated red cells in the bone marrow. In vitro assays detecting hematopoietic colony-forming units revealed that these antigens are expressed by virtually all mature erythroid colony-forming units (day-7 CFU-E), and the majority of the more primitive erythroid burst forming units (day-14 BFU-E). H-25 but not H-366 was also found on a variable proportion of the day-7 and day-14 granulocytic/monocytic colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in the bone marrow. The same type of precursor cells are also found in the H-25 and H-366 positive cell populations isolated from peripheral blood. In preliminary testing of cells from acute leukemic patients, FACS analysis showed that both antigens are also expressed on leukemic cells from patients with T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and with myeloid leukemias. These studies demonstrate that the H-25 and H-366 positive NK cells in the peripheral blood retain some of the cell surface properties of early hematopoietic precursor cells, thus providing further evidence supporting the bone marrow origin of NK cells.\r"

The first, JTPI-1, was directed against the reative site of alpha 2PI and inhibited antiplasmin activity by interfering with the formation of alpha 2PI-plasmin complexes. The avidity of JTPI-1 to the preformed alpha 2PI-plasmin complex was markedly lower than that to free alpha 2PI, which made this antibody useful for measuring the free alpha 2PI in plasma. The second, JTPI-2, recognized an epitope in the C-terminal fragment of alpha 2PI (11,000 daltons [11 K]) that was cleaved from alpha 2PI by plasmin upon complex formation but remained noncovalently attached to the complex. However, binding of JTPI-2 to alpha 2PI was not inhibited by the C-terminal 26-residue peptide containing the plasminogen-binding site and had no effect on the function of alpha 2PI. These data suggested that JTPI-2 recognized an epitope between the C-terminal 26-residue peptide and the reactive site. The third, JTPI-3, bound the alpha 2PI-plasmin complex (150 K) as well as alpha 2PI. Binding was inhibited by the N-terminal 12-residue peptide of alpha 2PI, but factor XIII-catalyzed cross-linking of alpha 2PI to fibrin was not inhibited by JTPI-3. These results suggested that the antibody recognized an epitope near the N terminus. These three monoclonal antibodies were useful for analyzing the mechanism of interaction between alpha 2PI and plasmin.\r"

The inhibitory effect on L-CFU was significantly greater than that on CFU-GM. No correlation was observed between the inhibitory effect on L-CFU and the number of colonies formed in the cultures without rH-TNF. Preincubation of the progenitor cells in culture medium containing 20% fetal calf serum with up to 1,000 U/mL of rH-TNF for 24 hours did not result in the inhibition of colony growth of L-CFU or CFU-GM. The inhibitory effect of rH-TNF was neutralized by an anti-rH-TNF murine monoclonal antibody.\r"

  ".W": "A kindred is described in which two brothers with a poikilocytic variant of hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) were found to have a defect of spectrin dimer association and a decreased spectrin-band 3 ratio. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of limited tryptic digests of their spectrin revealed decreased amounts of the alpha I domain when compared with control digests and the appearance of two major peptides with mol wts of 43,000 and 42,000 and isoelectric points (5.75 to 5.85) more basic than the alpha I domain. Tryptic digests of spectrin from the asymptomatic mother of the two brothers were normal. Immunoblots of the two-dimensional gels using an antiserum to the alpha I domain revealed that the 43,000- and 42,000-dalton peptides were derived from the alpha I domain, along with a series of lower mol wt peptides, some of which were below the detection limits of Coomassie blue-stained gels. Limit chymotryptic maps of 125I-labeled tryptic peptides confirmed that the 43,000- and 42,000-dalton peptides were derived from the alpha I domain. This kindred represents a new structural variant of spectrin in HE in that the major abnormal tryptic peptides derived from the alpha I domain have lower mol wts and more basic isoelectric points than hitherto described.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-eight patients with malignant disease were divided into two groups based on the results of the platelet antithrombin test (PAT). The normal group had a PAT clotting time ranging from 21.4 to 29.8 seconds, which was equivalent to 25% to 65% inactivation of the 2 U of thrombin added to the test system. The other group showed abnormal PAT clotting time, less than 21.4 seconds or less than 25% thrombin inactivation. The polypeptide composition of platelets from the two patient groups was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. A polypeptide of 180,000 apparent mol wt was decreased or absent in both Coomassie blue- and Alcian blue-stained gels of the platelets from patients whose PAT was abnormal; this polypeptide comigrated with purified platelet thrombospondin. Tritium labeling of platelet surface glycoproteins by the periodate-borohydride method followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed on platelets of seven patients with abnormal PAT. When they were compared with ten patients with normal PAT, a glycoprotein of 140,000 apparent mol wt with a pl of 4.5 to 5.2 was decreased in platelets of all seven patients with abnormal PAT. Nitrocellulose replicas of one-dimensional gels of platelets from 13 of 14 patients with abnormal PAT showed decreased reaction with an anti-human platelet glycocalicin antiserum. Platelets of these same patients also showed a decreased or absent platelet agglutination induced by ristocetin. Patients with normal PAT had a mean agglutination slope of 1.25 +/- 0.6 (n = 26) as compared with 0.37 +/- 0.34 (n = 26) for the abnormal PAT group (P less than .001). Results indicate that platelets from a subpopulation of tumor patients characterized by decreased platelet antithrombin activity have alterations in two platelet glycoproteins, identified as GPIb and thrombospondin.\r"

To examine the role of the glutathione cycle in metabolizing H2O2, we incubated PMN with 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl) nitrosourea (BCNU). Incubation of PMN with BCNU results in a dose-dependent inhibition of PMN glutathione reductase (GRED), with 50% inhibition occurring at approximately 2 micrograms/mL BCNU. PMN hexose monophosphate shunt activity stimulated with an exogenous H2O2-generating system was inhibited only when the GRED activity was reduced to less than 30% of control. BCNU-treated cells contained lower levels of reduced sulfhydryls and reduced glutathione, which decreased even more in the presence of an exogenous H2O2-generating system. The effect of BCNU and exogenous H2O2 on various aspects of phagocytosis were examined. Exposure of BCNU-treated PMN to an H2O2-generating system resulted in an inhibition of chemotactic peptide-induced shape changes and degranulation. The ability of BCNU-treated cells to produce O2- was diminished only when the PMN were incubated with an H2O2-generating system in the presence of cyanide. Ingestion of opsonized bacteria by BCNU-treated PMN was unaffected by incubation in an H2O2-generating system even in the presence of cyanide. We conclude that PMN GRED is inhibited by BCNU, the ability of PMN to metabolize H2O2 is affected only when GRED is reduced more than 70%, this inhibition affects the glutathione content of these cells, and some, but not all of the phagocytic functions of GRED-inhibited PMN are inhibited after exposure to an H2O2-generating system.\r"

His blood picture showed the unique coexistence of leukocytosis with matured cells and a large number of blast cells. The in vitro proliferation and differentiation of blast cells into various lineages in the presence of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte conditioned medium (PHA-LCM) was examined by using a liquid culture and a methylcellulose culture system. The differentiation of blast cells into myeloid cells was confirmed by specific cytochemical stainings, electron microscopy, and an immunologic study. No specific factors in the plasma of the patient promoted the proliferation or differentiation of blast cells. The cellular composition of colonies grown in methylcellulose culture from single blast cells was studied by a micromanipulation technique. High plating efficiency was observed. Of 136 cultures, 78 showed colony growth. Half of the blast cells were colony-forming cells that could proliferate and differentiate into basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and erythrocytes in the presence of PHA-LCM. Using the blast cells with a high differentiation capacity to the basophil pathway, we studied the effect of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Recombinant GM-CSF support neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages but not typical basophils. These findings of the cell differentiation of blast cells into various kinds of cells in vitro were in agreement with the finding of neutrophilia, eosinophilia, basophilia, and thrombocythemia in this patient.\r"

  ".W": "Substances that circulate in the blood following drug-induced bone marrow aplasia produce a biphasic curve of DNA synthesis in cells in liquid and semisolid cultures which reflect relative concentrations of these growth regulators of hematopoiesis. This net effect magnified by induced marrow failure in human, rat, and mouse is a sinusoidal curve that is the reciprocal of the WBC. Generated in the bone marrow, humoral stimulating activity (HSA) produces peak growth of colonies in agar (CFU-GM) during the proliferative phase of bone marrow recovery, whereas humoral inhibitory activity (HIA), present at the time of marrow maturation, suppresses colony growth. Split femurs from rats given cyclophosphamide (CY) and killed at regular intervals condition media that affect DNA synthesis in a fashion similar to that of HSA-HIA in the rats' sera. In Dexter cultures, HSA is derived from the adherent rather than the hematopoietic cell, whereas HIA is produced by that nonadherent cell. Animals treated with a lethal dose of busulfan (BU) produce large amounts of HSA in vivo until death. Those transplanted with adherent bone marrow cells depleted of hematopoietic cells on day 1 after BU also die, whereas those given nonadherent marrow cells survive and generate HIA at the time of bone marrow recovery. HSA and media conditioned by bone marrow stromal cells causes an increase in spleen colonies (CFU-S), as does HIA. These studies support the contention that the net effect of putative regulators of hematopoiesis, measured in the drug-perturbed state, consist of a constantly present stimulator emanating from bone marrow stroma, and a variable inhibitor produced by maturing hematopoietic bone marrow cells.\r"

To clarify the relationship of stress platelets to proplatelets, rats were injected with heterologous platelet antiserum. Nondiscoid platelet forms, some characteristically beaded in appearance, strongly resembling bone marrow proplatelets, can be recovered in the circulation of normal rats. During the early period of recovery from acute thrombocytopenia, there was a substantial increase in the proportion of these elongated platelets in the citrated platelet rich plasma. Exposure to EDTA rendered them spherical. Circulating proplatelets may contribute significantly to the prompt increase in platelet volume during recovery from acute thrombocytopenia at a time prior to significant increase in megakaryocyte size and ploidy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to use a cultured human cell line of hematopoietic origin for in vitro assays of antibody binding to overcome the relative inaccessibility of natural human marrow progenitor cells. This report describes the detection, using radioiodinated staphylococcal protein A (SPA), of antibodies binding to a human promyelocytic cell line (HL-60) in sera from three patients with chronic idiopathic granulocytic hypoplasia (\"pure white cell aplasia,\" PWCA) and 22 patients with other syndromes of suspected immune neutropenia. Bone marrow from patients with increased IgG binding to HL-60 cells showed less than 15% granulocytic lineage cellularity in 11 of 17 cases. In vitro differentiation of HL-60 cells by retinoic acid resulted in increased IgG binding for sera that had shown increased IgG binding to mature granulocytes but not undifferentiated HL-60 cells; in contrast, for sera with antibodies to untreated HL-60 cells and for normal serum, in vitro differentiation had little effect on IgG binding. Antibodies eluted from mature granulocytes were similar to the parent serum regarding the ratio of IgG binding to mature cells v HL-60 cells. No sera from 19 patients with febrile transfusion reactions showed increased IgG binding to HL-60 cells in the absence of increased IgG binding to mature granulocytes, although two sera had antibodies to both cell types. The use of HL-60 cells as targets may permit measurement of serum antibodies associated with granulocytic hypoplasia. In combination with assays to detect antibody binding to mature granulocytes, these techniques may discriminate among autoantibody specificities for antigens that are gained, conserved, or lost during myeloid maturation.\r"

  ".W": "We recently showed that platelets contain submembranous actin filaments that are linked to glycoprotein (GP) Ib on the plasma membrane. In the present study, experiments were performed to determine whether spectrin was associated with these filaments. The membrane-bound filaments were isolated from Triton X-100 (Sigma, St Louis) lysates of unstimulated platelets by differential centrifugation. Platelet spectrin was detected immunologically by using antibodies against human brain and RBC spectrin. Immunoblots showed that platelet spectrin consisted of two polypeptides (mol wt 240,000 and 235,000) that were similar in apparent mol wt to those of the alpha and beta chains of brain spectrin but differed slightly from those of RBC spectrin (mol wt 240,000 and 220,000). Immunoprecipitation experiments identified platelet spectrin as two minor polypeptides migrating on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels between actin-binding protein (mol wt 250,000) and the platelet polypeptide P235 (mol wt 235,000). Immunoblots of fractions isolated from Triton X-100-lysed platelets revealed that the alpha and beta chains of platelet spectrin were associated almost entirely with the actin filaments that were linked to the plasma membrane. Little spectrin was recovered in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction or with the actin filaments that were not membrane bound. During activation of platelets with thrombin or ionophore A23187, the alpha and beta chains of spectrin were hydrolyzed, generating a major degradation product of mol wt 160,000 and a minor one of mol wt 170,000. These two hydrolytic products were also generated in Triton X-100 lysates incubated in the presence of Ca2+ but were not produced when lysates were treated with leupeptin, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), or N-ethylmaleimide, known inhibitors of the Ca2+-dependent protease. These experiments show that spectrin is a previously unidentified component of the membrane-bound actin filament network and that hydrolysis of spectrin by the Ca2+-dependent protease may regulate the interactions of the filaments during platelet activation.\r"

The colonies consisted of 20 to 200 nonhemoglobinized large blast cells. Cytogenetic analysis of single colonies revealed hypotetraploid karyotypes with several marker chromosomes that were identical to those found in directly sampled bone marrow. The concurrently formed erythroid bursts showed only normal karyotypes. No leukemic colony formation was observed in other culture systems with either colony-stimulating activity (CSA) or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM). The leukemic colonies exhibited a complete EPO-dose dependency similar to that of the patient's normal BFU-E. Although cytochemical and immunologic marker studies of the bone marrow cells failed to clarify the cell lineage of the leukemic cells with extraordinarily large cell size, ultrastructural study revealed erythroid differentiation such as siderosome formation in the cytoplasm and ferritin particles in the rhophecytosis invaginations. These findings indicate that the patient had poorly differentiated erythroid leukemia and that some of the clonogenic cells might respond to EPO in vitro. Corresponding to this biological feature, the leukemic cells were markedly decreased in number in response to repeated RBC transfusions, and partial remission was obtained. These observations suggest that erythroid leukemia distinct from erythroleukemia (M6) with a myeloblastic component, can develop as a minor entity of human acute leukemia.\r"

The factor Xa-catalyzed proteolysis of prothrombin Tokushima examined by SDS-PAGE was found to be identical to that of \"prothrombin.\" Subsequently thrombin Tokushima was prepared by CM-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography after prothrombin activation by factor Xa. The molecular weight of thrombin Tokushima estimated by SDS-PAGE was identical to that of \"thrombin.\" Thrombin Tokushima exhibited less than 22% of normal clotting activity, and the value of kcat/Km (mumol/L-1 second-1) was less than one tenth of that of \"thrombin\" when Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide was used as a substrate. However, active site titration using p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate failed to detect any difference between the two. Thrombin Tokushima was 2.5% as effective as \"thrombin\" in inducing platelet aggregation. Interaction of thrombin Tokushima with antithrombin III was much slower than \"thrombin\" when followed by SDS-PAGE. Based on the residual thrombin activity, it was 33% as effective as \"thrombin\" in forming a complex with antithrombin III. These results indicate that the molecular defect resides in the thrombin portion of prothrombin Tokushima and that the binding sites for various substrates appear to be greatly impaired.\r"

SZ 2 immunoprecipitated the components of the glycoprotein Ib complex, glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IX, from Triton-X-100-solubilized, periodate-labeled platelets. Western blot analysis indicated that the epitope for SZ 2 was on the alpha-subunit of glycoprotein Ib. Scatchard analysis of SZ 2 binding to formaldehyde-fixed, washed platelets revealed a single class of binding sites with Kd = 6.6 +/- 3.3 X 10(-10) mol/L and 15,200 +/- 4,100 binding sites per platelet (mean +/- SD, n = 10). Intact antibody and its purified (Fab')2 fragments not only inhibited the ristocetin-dependent binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets and ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination but also inhibited platelet aggregation induced by Type I collagen and platelet-activating factor (PAF). SZ 2 inhibited platelet serotonin and beta-thromboglobulin release in response to these stimuli and also platelet thromboxane A2 formation in response to ristocetin and collagen. SZ 2 was without effect on platelet aggregation or release in response to other platelet stimuli such as ADP, thrombin, or arachidonic acid. The inhibition by SZ 2 of collagen- and PAF-induced platelet aggregation is surprising in that Bernard-Soulier syndrome platelets, which lack the glycoprotein Ib complex, respond normally to both these stimuli. SZ 2 was unreactive toward Bernard-Soulier syndrome platelets, as evaluated by fluorescence-associated cell sorting, and had no effect on the collagen- and PAF-induced aggregation of Bernard-Soulier syndrome platelets. The combined results suggest that the inhibition by SZ 2 of collagen- and PAF-induced aggregation of normal platelets is steric and are consistent with the glycoprotein Ib complex and the platelet collagen and PAF receptor(s) being adjacent in the human platelet plasma membrane.\r"

Nearly all (greater than 90%) BPI was recovered during the subcellular fractionation of neutrophils (N2 cavitation and discontinuous Percoll gradient) in fractions containing primary granules. Little BPI was released from intact cells during degranulation (cytochalasin B and f-Met-Leu-Phe) or could be extracted from isolated granules with salt or weak acid, which suggests that most granule-associated BPI is membrane bound. Double staining of bone marrow smears for BPI and lactoferrin revealed BPI only in neutrophil precursors including (pro)myelocytelike cells lacking lactoferrin, a marker of neutrophil secondary granules. Of several human cell lines tested, only the promyelocytelike HL-60 (and to a lesser extent, KG-1) cells contained BPI. BPI was present in a more mature subpopulation (less than 25%) of untreated HL-60 cells, recognized by surface marker analysis (rosetting with IgG-sensitized sheep RBC, the absence of proliferation-associated cell surface antigen). Induction of neutrophilic or monocytic differentiation caused, respectively, a small (approximately 50%) rise or fall in the BPI content. These findings indicate that BPI is a specific product of the neutrophil lineage and, hence, of the specialized cytotoxic apparatus of the neutrophil that plays an essential role in host defense v gram-negative bacteria.\r"

  ".U": "87101526\r", 
  ".W": "Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, has been shown to have beneficial effects in disorders characterized by extravascular fibrin deposition. Mononuclear phagocytes are present in extravascular sites and are capable of expressing both plasminogen activator and procoagulant activities, which suggests these cells play a central role in extravascular fibrin turnover. We therefore sought to determine whether dipyridamole affects the expression of plasminogen activator and procoagulant activities by rabbit alveolar macrophages cultured in vitro. We found that dipyridamole (10 to 100 mumol/L) caused increases in both cell-associated and released plasminogen activator activity, which reached levels of 240% (P less than .05) and 543% (P less than .01) of controls, respectively. In contrast, dipyridamole decreased the cell-associated procoagulant activity of alveolar macrophages to as little as 21.3% of controls (P less than .01). Similar effects were seen in cells cotreated with lymphokines. The procoagulant activity expressed by these cells functioned as a tissue thromboplastin. The plasminogen activator of control and treated cells was a urokinase as determined by molecular weight characteristics (50 kilodaltons) and by antibody neutralization profiles using polyclonal antibodies against human urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator. These effects of dipyridamole could not be duplicated by structurally dissimilar agents sharing some of the pharmacological actions of dipyridamole; however, two pyrimidopyrimidine compounds structurally similar to dipyridamole effectively mimicked the effects on both procoagulant and plasminogen activator activities. We conclude that dipyridamole may have antithrombotic effects by directly modulating the role of mononuclear phagocytes in fibrin turnover. Thus, dipyridamole may be useful in situations where extravascular fibrin deposition is important to the pathogenesis of tissue injury and repair.\r"

  ".U": "87101527\r", 
  ".W": "We have used two murine monoclonal antibodies, each directed against one component of the human platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex, to examine further the molecular requirements for fibrinogen binding to the platelet surface and subsequent platelet-platelet cohesion (aggregation). Although neither AP3, which is directed against GPIIIa, nor Tab, which is specific for GPIIb, were individually able to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced fibrinogen binding, platelet aggregation, or secretion, the combination of AP3 and Tab completely abolished platelet aggregation and the release reaction. Unexpectedly, this synergistic inhibition of platelet-platelet cohesion occurred in the presence of apparently normal fibrinogen binding. Both the number of fibrinogen molecules bound and the dissociation constant for fibrinogen binding remained essentially unchanged in the presence of these two antibodies. Inhibition of aggregation was dependent upon the divalency of both AP3 and Tab because substitution of Fab fragments of either antibody for the intact IgG resulted in a complete restoration of both aggregation and secretion. In contrast to ADP induction, thrombin-activated platelets neither aggregated nor bound fibrinogen in the presence of AP3 plus Tab but were fully capable of secretion, which illustrated the multiple mechanisms by which the platelet surface can respond to different agonists. These data demonstrate that fibrinogen binding to the platelet surface alone is not sufficient to support platelet-platelet cohesion and that an additional post-fibrinogen-binding event(s) that is inhibitable by these two monoclonal antibodies may be required.\r"

Each cryoglobulin had a characteristic fine structure that correlated with its gross morphology. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the amorphous precipitates were random and disorganized molecular clumps. In contrast, cryogels were thin-walled, well-organized, and hydrated strawlike clusters, whereas cryocrystals formed tightly compacted, highly structured molecular clusters. Crystals that formed in blood produced rouleaux, and analysis by scanning electron microscopy indicated that the crystals could form thick-walled, branching, macromolecular nets that could physically trap cells. The morphological properties provided visual impressions by which cryoglobulins could cause clinical disease secondary to vascular occlusion produced by self-associated IgG cryoglobulin molecules.\r"

  ".U": "87101530\r", 
  ".W": "Protein S is a plasma protein that serves as a cofactor for the anticoagulant effects of activated protein C. Congenital protein S deficiency is often associated with thromboembolic disease. During pregnancy a decrease in the functional and antigenic levels of protein S occurs; this change in protein S status may contribute to the thromboembolic complications that sometimes occur during pregnancy. In certain patients, oral contraceptive use has also been associated with thrombotic complications. In this study, protein S status was determined in 21 women taking oral contraceptives and compared with that of 21 women not taking oral contraceptives and that of 21 men. The results show that women taking oral contraceptives have significantly lower total protein S (24.3 +/- 3.6 micrograms/mL; mean +/- SD) than women not taking oral contraceptives (28.6 +/- 3.9 micrograms/mL) (P less than .005). Men had significantly higher protein S levels (30.9 +/- 3.9 micrograms/mL, P less than .01) than age-matched women not taking oral contraceptives. In plasma, an equilibrium exists between free (functionally active) protein S and protein S complexed to C4b-binding protein, which is functionally inactive. The mean levels of C4b-binding protein were essentially the same among the three groups, but the levels of free protein S were significantly different and reflected different total protein S antigen levels. Additionally, we found that inflammation significantly elevated C4b-binding protein levels and could result in a further significant decrease in free protein S levels. These data indicate that plasma protein S levels are significantly affected by hormonal status and inflammation.\r"

Seventy-six patients were considered with 86 biopsies and mammograms resulting in detection of 32 cancers and 54 benign lesions. There was no difference in accuracy of interpretation between mammography and xeromammography. The sensitivities were: mammography 0.91, xeromammography 0.88. The specificities were: mammography 0.63, xeromammography 0.75. We conclude that both modalities are comparable in detecting cancer when optimal technique and experienced personnel are used.\r"

Survival was unrelated to age, sex or cell type. However, pain and abnormal bone scintigraphy were both independently associated with a significantly reduced survival compared with those who were free of pain or who had normal bone scintigraphy. These factors were cumulative. The association remained equally valid for all cell types. Claims that a single metastasis is not prognostically significant are unfounded. It is suggested that the results of some chemotherapy trials must be reconsidered in the light of present findings, because of the lack of adequate control groups; the results could be construed to show a beneficial effect only in patients with bone metastases and a poor prognosis, but little or no effect in patients with normal bone scintigraphy. As judged by clinical and radiological follow-up and post-mortem examination, skeletal scintigraphy in patients with lung cancer had a sensitivity of 0.89, a non-specificity (false positives/true negatives) of 0.00 and an accuracy of 0.78. With existing radiopharmaceuticals there is an irreducible residue of false negatives due to deposits which provoke little or no osteoblastic response. Bone scintigraphy is, thus, indicated in any patient with lung cancer with unexplained symptoms and whenever staging is required, because of the prognostic implications. It should precede other staging investigations because the high detection rate may render other tests unnecessary.\r"

The majority of patients had bulky disease with a mean tumour volume of 206 cm3. In 63 of 67 attempted treatments heating was achieved, temperatures in excess of 42 degrees C being reached in the pelvis in 78%. Heat doses, however, were low, only 41% of treatments exceeding 5 min equivalent at 43 degrees C. Treatment was usually limited by acute toxicity and, although this was marked, it was of short duration and no long-term sequelae have been noted. With gain in operator experience, later treatments have achieved improved thermal doses. Response was difficult to assess but we have documented responses in six of 12 assessable patients. Palliation has been achieved in all patients with symptoms. Preliminary attempts to shift the region of maximum heating by phase variations in the APA output are promising, and this technique should improve the quality of treatments and reduce toxicity. The APA is thus capable of inducing pelvic regional hyperthermia, and a randomised controlled study is now planned to assess the value of pelvic hyperthermia as a treatment modality.\r"

The number of patients who were stone-free 3 months after treatment was low (44.1%) compared with the numbers reported in other series.

Major complications, although few, include haemorrhage, septicaemia, \"Steinstrasse\" formation and cardiac arrhythmias. The experience from 600 consecutive cases is reviewed and methods of prevention are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Open surgery for large or complex renal calculi may be difficult, particularly in patients with recurrent stones, and may require special operative techniques to preserve renal function. With the advent of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) new approaches are now available for the treatment of these difficult cases. A review of 67 patients who presented between November 1984 and May 1986 has shown that it was possible to clear large stones in 71% of patients using a combination of PCNL and ESWL. There was no mortality; the morbidity for both procedures was low and was less than when either procedure was used alone for the treatment of complex stones.\r"
