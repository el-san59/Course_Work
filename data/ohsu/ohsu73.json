After a partial laminectomy at L5, a silicone rubber catheter was inserted into the subarachnoid space and advanced 10 cm cranially. A model 400 Infusaid pump, used for drug delivery, was placed in a subcutaneous pocket between the 13th rib and iliac crest. Drug infusions were individually adjusted and maintained at a concentration such that the animal just exhibited slight gait impairment. Daily bupivacaine doses ranged from 5.7-11.1 mg. Infusions were maintained for a period of 3-16 weeks. Light microscopic examination of spinal cord and roots revealed no abnormalities. A focal mononuclear cell infiltration of the leptomeninges was seen in two drug animals, as well as one catheter control animal. One of the 16-week animals had a residual limp upon drug removal. While we were not able to quantitatively assess the degree of sensory motor dissociation, the results of this study suggest that chronic intrathecal bupivacaine infusion through an implantable pump system may be a short-term alternative to intrathecal morphine in the control of cancer pain.\r"

These septa are incomplete, however, forming small bubble-like pockets when solution is injected. Single injections of methylene blue and Latex solutions into the axillary sheath resulted in immediate dye staining of median, radial, and ulnar nerves, despite the presence of septa. These data demonstrate that there are connections between compartments within the sheath and, therefore, do not support the need for multiple injections when performing an axillary block.\r"

The evoked potentials were averaged at the scalp from the electroencephalogram following repeated bilateral posterior tibial nerve stimulation at the ankle. Latencies and amplitudes of the resulting potentials were measured and compared with the post-induction control values. Graded increase in latencies and graded decrease in amplitudes were found with increasing concentrations of all the three agents (P less than 0.05), confirming that the effects were dose related. Reductions in amplitudes were more marked than increase in latencies. The authors conclude that, during nitrous oxide-based anesthesia, enflurane, and isoflurane resulted in less alteration of somatosensory cortical evoked potentials than halothane. In conjunction with 60% nitrous oxide, 0.5 and 0.75 MAC of halothane, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 MAC of isoflurane and enflurane, respectively, were found to be compatible with the generation of waves adequate for evaluation.\r"

In this study, the mechanism of action of barbiturates was examined in dogs with intracranial hypertension induced by injecting autogenous incubated blood into the chiasmatic cistern. Intracranial pressure and systemic blood pressure were continuously monitored. A single bilateral administration of powdered pentobarbital (2 mg and 0.4 mg) in experimental animals and solid d-glucose (2 mg) in control animals was given into the posterior hypothalamus, pontine reticular formation, or medullary reticular formation when intracranial pressure reached 20-30 mmHg after the blood injection--usually in 3-6 h. The increased intracranial pressure following the experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage was always associated with either intracranial pressure irregularities or concomitant blood pressure variations, suggesting the presence of vasomotor instability. Administration of both 2 mg and 0.4 mg of pentobarbital into the medulla caused a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease of the intracranial pressure to 44 and 65% of control and stabilization of the intracranial pressure irregularities, whereas pentobarbital given at the other sites did not. The blood pressure was also decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) to 80 and 88% of control and the blood pressure variations were stabilized in animals after administration of pentobarbital into the medulla, whereas in those given pentobarbital at the other sites, it was not. The results suggest that, in the presence of elevated intracranial pressure following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, the mechanisms of action of barbiturates in reducing the intracranial pressure may result from alleviation of cerebral vasomotor instability by depression of the vasomotor center of the medulla.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which halothane interferes with catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction was examined, utilizing specific agonists at postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. Stimulation of either adrenoceptor subtype normally produces vasoconstriction. Two experimental models of drug-induced vasoconstriction were used: in vivo blood pressure response in pithed rats, and in vitro isometric tension development in canine saphenous vein rings. These models were then utilized to examine the anti-vasoconstriction properties of halothane. In vivo, halothane (1 MAC) produced a significant depression in the vascular response to azepexole (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist), but halothane did not alter vasoconstriction by phenylephrine (an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist). Halothane caused a 24% reduction of maximal response (P less than 0.0001) to azepexole in pithed rats, and a 3.2-fold rightward shift of the log dose-response curve (P less than 0.0001). Similarly, in vitro, halothane significantly attenuated alpha 2- but not alpha 1-adrenoceptor responsiveness. Halothane (4%) depressed maximal vein contraction to azepexole by 26% (P less than 0.0001), and shifted the log concentration-response curve 2.4-fold to the right (P less than 0.0001). The observed selective interference with alpha 2-mediated vasoconstriction by halothane is unlikely to represent drug antagonism at the receptor level. Our observations may suggest, indirectly, that halothane interferes with Ca+2 entry into vascular smooth muscle. The phenomenon of selective anti-vasoconstriction at alpha 2-adrenoceptors by halothane may explain why alpha 1-adrenergic agonists often appear to retain their vasopressor activity during halothane anesthesia. The mechanism of halothane-induced vasodilation thus includes attenuation of alpha 2- but not alpha 1-adrenergic vasoconstriction; this further demonstrates the multifactorial nature of halothane-induced vasodilation.\r"

At 3-4-week intervals, each of six conditioned mongrel dogs (23 +/- 1 kg) received amrinone (A) (4 mg/kg plus 100 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), verapamil (V) (200 micrograms/kg plus 7.5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) and propranolol (P) (150 micrograms/kg plus 0.8 microgram X kg-1 X min-1) in four different orders of administration: VAP, AVP, VPA, and PVA. Plasma levels achieved were 15 +/- 1 to 24 +/- 2 micrograms/ml for amrinone, 24 +/- 2 to 59 +/- 10 ng/ml for propranolol, and 81 +/- 10 to 163 +/- 17 ng/ml for verapamil, equivalent to high therapeutic (amrinone) and therapeutic (propranolol, verapamil) levels in humans. The results of this study show that amrinone is able to reverse many of the effects of verapamil (group VAP) and also many of the effects of verapamil-propranolol or propranolol-verapamil (groups VPA, PVA) combinations. Amrinone improved cardiac index, left ventricular dP/dtmax, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and central venous pressure without increasing catecholamines. However, mean arterial pressure remained decreased with decreased systemic vascular resistance, which necessitates careful consideration depending upon patient circumstances. The results also show that verapamil-propranolol can reverse the positive inotropic effects of amrinone (group AVP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighteen male SHR and 18 WKY rats were subdivided into conscious animals and those anesthetized with isoflurane, 1.2 vol% inspired. During brief isoflurane anesthesia, cannulae were placed in the left cardiac ventricle, the femoral artery, and the femoral vein. Central and regional hemodynamics were determined with 85Sr-labeled microspheres (15 +/- 1 micron) using the reference sample technique in both conscious and anesthetized animals. Isoflurane anesthesia caused similar reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in all rats. This was due to a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance in WKY rats, whereas MAP declined due to a significant decrease in cardiac output in SHR rats. In the anesthetized WKY rat, the decrease in total systemic vascular resistance resulted from significant decreases in vascular resistance of the brain and nonrespiratory skeletal muscles. In the anesthetized SHR rat, both decreases (cerebellum, hepatic artery) and increases (GI tract, skin, diaphragm) in regional vascular resistances occurred, resulting in no net change in total systemic vascular resistance. In both SHR and WKY rats, isoflurane redistributed blood flow in favor of the brain at the expense of blood flow to the GI tract, diaphragm, and skin. Blood flows to the liver, GI tract, and skin were significantly less in the anesthetized SHR as compared with WKY rats. It is concluded that isoflurane influences central and regional hemodynamics differently in hypertensive, as compared with normotensive, rats.\r"

Oxygen consumption was determined from continuous respiratory gas exchange analysis and arterio-venous oxygen difference from fiberoptic oximetry. A computer calculated cardiac output and other variables every 20 s. Seven pigs were monitored for a total of 10 h, during which cardiac output was manipulated by obstructing venous return or infusing epinephrine. 1748 pairs of EMCO and CFCO values were compared. The best correlation was obtained when CFCO was advanced 20 s with respect to EMCO (R = .89, CFCO = .99 EMCO + .16). TDCO was compared to EMCO during periods of steady state (R = .85, TDCO = .89 EMCO + 1.25, N = 139). TDCO was also compared with simultaneous CFCO (R = .87, TDCO = .89 CFCO + 1.01, N = 251). CFCO is recommended as a reliable standard of continuous cardiac output measurement. It is not a real time measurement; the technique has a time lag of approximately 20 s which is the result of the time constant of the VO2 measurement. Sources for error are discussed with suggestions for improving quality control.\r"

At the end of 60-75 min of anesthesia, blood was sampled for arterial blood gas and plasma glucose analysis, and the brain was rapidly sampled and frozen for analysis of energy metabolites. Physiologic variables were maintained as follows: PaCO2 30-40 mmHg, pHa 7.20-7.40, PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg, MAP greater than 60 mmHg, and rectal temperature 37.5-38.5 degrees C. Mean plasma glucose concentrations in the three groups were as follows (muMol/ml +/- SEM): halothane, 7.45 /- .62; enflurane, 6.95 +/- .22; isoflurane, 10.11 +/- 1.00. Mean brain glucose concentrations in the three groups were (muMol/gm wet weight): halothane, 2.04 +/- .20; enflurane, 2.07 +/- .26; isoflurane, 3.04 +/- .31. Plasma and brain glucose levels were significantly increased in the isoflurane group compared to the other two groups (P less than .05) with no differences occurring in the brain/plasma glucose ratio among the three groups. No differences were present between groups in brain lactate, pyruvate, fructose diphosphate, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate, phosphocreatine, or adenine nucleotides. Thus, at one MAC concentration, major differences between volatile anesthetics on brain energy availability are not present, although isoflurane raised cerebral glucose levels.\r"

The difference between immature angiomas and other hemangiomas has been demonstrated by investigations into cell dynamics. To facilitate a differentiated diagnosis and prognosis, the hemodynamics of the angiomas were studied with the Doppler flowmeter. The use of noninvasive techniques, such as those introduced by the Doppler flowmeter, permit a technical alternative and/or integration, giving results of equal relevance and importance, as well as the advantages of a more accessible and less expensive methodology.\r"

Thirty-one such patients were contacted two to seven years after rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography. Eleven had had significant cardiovascular events. Event-free survival at forty-eight months was 64%. Ten of eleven events occurred in 21 patients with decline in ejection fraction (EF), but the magnitude of decline did not further separate the group with regard to prognosis. Eight events (73% of total events) occurred in the 11 patients (35% of total patients) with an EF during exercise of 0.55 or less. The short and intermediate outlook for asymptomatic patients with AR and normal resting LV function is good regardless of the response of the EF to exercise, but an exercise EF less than or equal to 0.55 does identify a relatively high-risk subset for deterioration beyond twenty-four months.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated the relationship between sympathetic nerve activity and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcpO2) in normal and ischemic lower extremities. Dorsal foot TcpO2 was measured by using oxygen-sensing electrodes with surface temperatures of 42 degrees C and 45 degrees C; in theory, changes in sympathetic activity should affect vasomotor tone and TcpO2 in skin beneath an electrode at 42 degrees C (submaximal vasodilation), but not at 45 degrees C (maximal vasodilation). The vasodilation index (TcpO2 at 42 degrees C/TcpO2 at 45 degrees C) was created as an index of vasomotor tone (vasodilation index increases as tone decreases). In normal limbs (n = 24) averages for TcpO2 at 42 degrees C, TcpO2 at 45 degrees C, and vasodilation index were 30.3 mmHg, 62.1 mmHg, and 0.47, respectively. In subjects (n = 5) with quadriplegia and reduced sympathetic tone secondary to cervical cord trauma, TcpO2 at 42 degrees C and vasodilation index were increased (45.0 mmHg and 0.61); TcpO2 at 45 degrees C did not change. When normal subjects (n = 7) were chilled for twenty minutes with a cooling blanket at 5 degrees C (to increase sympathetic tone) average vasodilation index dropped from 0.50 to 0.29. Among ischemic limbs (n = 34) vasodilation index was highly variable (range: 0-0.77); in general, vasodilation index fell as the ischemia worsened. In a subset of patients with ischemic limbs, the vasodilation index increased after the limb was wrapped in a warm dressing (average vasodilation index = 0.25 without dressing, 0.37 with dressing). The authors conclude: TcpO2 can be used to assess the degree of vasomotor tone (and sympathetic activity) in skin; tone generally increases as ischemia worsens; and local warmth can improve cutaneous circulation in ischemic limbs.\r"

AH and His bundle-to-ventricle (HV) intervals and SNRT were measured at spontaneous heart rate and at incremental atrial pacing rates (80, 100, 120, 140 bpm). Both drugs caused significant beta blockade as estimated by the percentage suppression of heart rate increment induced by 3 mcg isoproterenol administered intravenously (pindolol 67.6 +/- 5.3%, P less than 0.007; propranolol 38.6 +/- 10.6%, P less than 0.001). Propranolol significantly prolonged SNRT (P less than 0.05) and AH interval (P less than 0.05). Pindolol did not significantly affect either SNRT (P = 0.25) or AH intervals (P = 0.78). Significant effects on HV interval were not seen. Thus, in the doses tested that resulted in significant beta blockade, propranolol prolonged SA nodal recovery times and depressed AV nodal conduction while pindolol did not affect these variables.\r"

Plasma renin activity, its response to sodium depletion, and the renal vein renin ratio during sodium depletion were greater in unilateral than in bilateral stenosis. A fall in diastolic blood pressure induced by analog infusion during sodium depletion was correlated with the preinfusion plasma renin activity and with the renal vein renin ratio. Treatment with captopril showed a comparable hypotensive effect in unilateral and bilateral stenosis. The reduction in blood pressure was not correlated with the pretreatment renin levels or changes in blood pressure observed during analog infusion. Plasma renin activity rose and plasma aldosterone level fell in all patients. These results indicate that the mechanism maintaining high blood pressure is more renin dependent in unilateral than in bilateral stenosis and that the long-term effect of captopril does not depend solely on the suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\r"

  ".W": "In a subacute experiment 7 apparently healthy volunteers received a daily oral dose of 5 mg nebivolol for seven days, followed by a seven-day washout period with placebo. From the first day during treatment with nebivolol, peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure, as measured during a standardized submaximal treadmill exercise, significantly decreased by 15% and 19% respectively. A prolonged treatment for one week did not further increase the response of exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure to nebivolol. However, the ratio of preejection period (PEPc) to left ventricular ejection time (LVETc), an indirect and valuable measure of left ventricular performance, progressively and significantly decreased during the seven-day treatment period with nebivolol from a mean value of 0.37 +/- 0.012 to 0.31 +/- 0.009. The improvement of systolic time intervals resulted from a shortening of the PEPc and a lengthening of the LVETc. At rest, heart rate did not change significantly with nebivolol, whereas both systolic and diastolic blood pressure gradually and significantly lowered. The postexercise LVETc significantly shortened during treatment with nebivolol, and this shortening was more pronounced after seven days of treatment. After discontinuation of treatment with nebivolol, all these effects persisted for more than thirty hours after the last intake and gradually returned to pretreatment values thereafter. From these data it appears that nebivolol effectively reduces blood pressure at rest and during exercise in healthy volunteers, beneficially influencing preload and afterload, as measured by systolic time intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The loops and axes were rotated about the X axis (X-rot) and the Y axis (Y-rot). The spatial vector loop and orthogonal coordinates can be presented as viewed from any spheric direction. Eight quadrants were illustrated with four colors and red circles. The subjects consisted of 30 patients with old anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and 15 patients with old inferior MI. We measured the area of \"Bite\" in anterior MI and superior displacement in inferior MI. The MI index was defined and averaged in 361 directions. In anterior MI, the maximum mean index was obtained when X-rot is +90 degrees and Y-rot -40 degrees, viewed from upward and leftward, whereas in inferior MI it was obtained when X-rot is -50 degrees and Y-rot -80 degrees, viewed from downward and leftward. These values were significantly higher than those in conventional VCG projections, substantiating superior diagnostic sensitivity of 3-D VCG.\r"

Basal TcPO2 values can distinguish normal subjects only from stages III and IV PVD patients. In the case of stage II PVD patients the evaluation of the half-recovery time of TcPO2 basal values after an induced ischemia of the limb is mandatory. The study also showed that there are no significant statistical correlations among the TcPO2 values, Doppler, and plethysmographic parameters.\r"

Any consideration of the diagnosis of sepsis with shock in a recently anticoagulated elderly hospital patient should suggest the possibility of acute adrenal hemorrhage. Abdominal CT scan and a cosyntropin stimulation test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Failure of diagnosis has generally been associated with death in most patients, whereas prognosis in patients treated with corticosteroids is excellent.\r"

The percent decrease in nasal airway function, expressed as a change in conductance, was significantly less in the drug pretreatment tests when compared with placebo pretreatment. Eustachian tube function was also significantly improved by antihistamine/decongestant pretreatment as 13 of the 20 ET were obstructed at a higher antigen dose following drug pretreatment when compared with placebo.

Improper diagnosis and inadequate treatment result in potentially serious complications, including delayed fracture union, pseudoarthrosis, avascular necrosis, and wrist instability ultimately leading to deformity and osteoarthritis. Initial radiographs do not always demonstrate a discernible fracture line. To better define the frequency of initially negative radiographs of the navicular associated with true navicular fractures, and to test the efficacy of the three clinical signs (snuffbox tenderness, pain with supination against resistance, and pain with longitudinal compression of the thumb toward the navicular), a prospective study of 85 patients who presented to the emergency department during a four-year period with a mechanism of injury suggesting possible navicular injury was conducted. Forty-five patients had no demonstrable fracture or instability on initial examination or during the follow-up period. Forty patients ultimately were shown to have navicular fractures. Patients with negative radiographs and positive clinical findings were reevaluated after ten to 14 days of immobilization. Thirty-two patients had fracture lines visible on initial radiographic examination, and eight had lucent fracture lines demonstrated after ten to 14 days of immobilization. Snuffbox tenderness had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98% for fracture; supination against resistance had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98%; and longitudinal compression of the thumb had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. Chi-square analysis revealed a P value less than .001 for each of the three clinical maneuvers. This study reports a 20% occurrence of initially false-negative radiographs, which is higher than previously reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Demographic characteristics of the study group were consistent with results in the literature (55% men, mean age, 27). Cases were reviewed for 27 commonly accepted indications in the literature for cervical spine studies under these circumstances. The following radiograph findings were considered as positive studies: fracture, subluxation, spondylolisthesis, straightening, spasm, foreign body, compression, fusion, narrowing, or soft tissue swelling. Seventeen percent of radiographs were positive. Motor vehicle accidents (P less than .009), a history of direct cervical trauma (P less than .002), loss of consciousness (P less than .001), cervical tenderness (P less than .05), and drug ingestion (P less than .08) were associated with or suggestive of positive radiographs. No patients wearing seatbelts had positive radiographs (P less than .001). Only 2.4% (18 of 749) of radiographic examinations revealed clinically significant findings, and no criteria were statistically correlated with clinically significant findings. While our study suggests up to two-thirds of radiographs might be deferred without missing a clinically significant injury using these high-yield criteria, a flexible approach to cervical roentgenographs is justified pending confirmation of our results by a large, multicenter, prospective study currently under way.\r"

We undertook this study to assess whether higher doses of phenylephrine might improve regional CBF. Fifteen swine were allocated to receive either epinephrine 0.2 mg/kg, phenylephrine 1.0 mg/kg, or phenylephrine 10 mg/kg. Regional CBF measurements were made during normal sinus rhythm, during CPR, and during CPR following drug administration. Epinephrine 0.2 mg/kg was significantly better in improving regional CBF to the left and right cerebral cortices, cerebellum, midbrain, and cervical cord than was phenylephrine 1.0 mg/kg. There was no significant difference in regional CBF between the animals receiving epinephrine 0.2 mg/kg and phenylephrine 10 mg/kg. The study shows that large doses of epinephrine and phenylephrine may be required during CPR to improve regional cerebral blood flow following a prolonged arrest.\r"

Of those receiving CPZ, nine of 19 (47.4%) had sufficient relief from their headache to carry on with their activities of daily living, compared with four of 17 (23.5%) of the control group. This difference was not statistically significant. However, the drug was more often effective than a placebo in giving some relief from the headache (P less than .005) and in relieving nausea significantly more often than placebo (P less than .001). The only significant side effects were drowsiness (P less than .01), and an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure (10 mm Hg systolic) (P less than .05). This controlled study demonstrates that CPZ is a safe medication that provides some relief from migraine headaches, but it is less efficacious than suggested in earlier reports.\r"

A specially designed pharyngeal balloon replaces the mask of the EOA and provides sufficient seal, preventing the escape of air through the mouth and nose. The effectiveness of ventilation with the ETC in esophageal position was tested in a crossover study comparing ETC and ETA during routine operations in 31 patients. Blood gas measurements showed a significantly higher (P less than .001) mean arterial oxygen tension during ventilation with the ETC. The reason for this is not yet clear. Preliminary investigations during CPR in 21 arrest patients indicate that the ETC is as effective as the ETA.\r"

In studies of a canine model, the onset of lethal ventricular arrhythmias was temporally more associated with an elevation of serum potassium than with a drop in serum calcium. Fluoride-induced hyperkalemia could not be prevented with glucose, insulin, or bicarbonate. In the erythrocytes, a five-minute exposure to 10 mM NaF caused a 50% increase in extracellular potassium concentrations after 12 hours compared to control erythrocyte suspensions (P less than .001). The total potassium efflux after 12 hours of incubation was linearly related to the log of fluoride contact time (r, 0.886; P less than .001). The treatment of fluoride-induced hyperkalemia may depend on removal of fluoride and potassium.\r"

All patients presenting to the triage nurse at University Hospital with flu-like symptoms during February 1985 were asked to give blood samples for carboxyhemoglobin determination. Fifty-five patients (10% of those eligible) with headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, general malaise, or shortness of breath were enrolled in the study. Carboxyhemoglobin levels ranged from 0 to 21%. Thirteen patients (23.6%) of this self-selected subgroup had carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than or equal to 10%. There was no statistically significant difference in carboxyhemoglobin levels between smokers and nonsmokers. More patients using wood heat had elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels than patients using any other form of heating (P less than .05). No patient with a carboxyhemoglobin level greater than or equal to 10% was diagnosed as having subacute CO poisoning by emergency physicians. Physicians must seek out the possibility of CO toxicity in patients with flu-like illness, particularly in inner-city populations during the heating months. Fundoscopy and COHb levels may be useful in selected cases to correctly diagnose patients and avoid a return to a hazardous environment with potentially fatal consequences.\r"

  ".W": "Survival from cardiac arrest is higher when the collapse occurs outside the home. Of 781 patients collapsing at home, 101 (13%) survived to hospital discharge. This compared with 66 survivors among 248 (27%) patients arresting outside the home (P less than .001). Patients collapsing outside the home were younger and more frequently were men. Cardiac arrests outside the home were more often witnessed, more likely to have bystander CPR, less often preceded by symptoms, and the collapsing rhythm was more frequently ventricular fibrillation. Mean time to CPR was shorter. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the effect of location on survival was still statistically significant, although diminished, after adjusting for the above variables (P less than .01). We speculate that comorbidity, underlying etiology, and activity level may explain the remaining difference. Because 76% of arrests occur in the home, efforts to increase the frequency of bystander-CPR through targeted and dispatcher-assisted CPR programs are warranted.\r"

This study was undertaken to assess sudden death survivors' perceptions and satisfaction with their ED experience, as well as to identify potential weaknesses in their management. Family members of 66 patients who died in the ED from January 1980 to March 1985 were surveyed by telephone interview regarding the care they, as survivors, received while in the ED. Forty-seven of 66 (71%) were satisfied, 19 of 66 (29%) believed that their family received average or worse than average care. Thirty-seven of 66 (56%) survivors viewed the deceased in the ED; five regretted this. Twenty-nine survivors did not view; seven (24%) had regrets. Participants were questioned about attitudes expressed by the ED staff. Most responses were favorable, but a significant number thought the staff cold, unsympathetic, and not reassuring. Areas of apparent survivor dissatisfaction are discussed.\r"

Age of the patients was 55.8 +/- 13.7 yr (mean +/- SD), FEV1 was 1.77 +/- 0.81 L, and FEV1/FVC ratio was 52.6 +/- 10.5%. Dyspnea ratings were obtained for each clinical method by 2 independent observers; estimates of the magnitude of 5 resistive loads (10 to 85 cm H2O/L/s) were obtained using the Borg category scale (0 to 10). For comparative purposes, 12 age-matched (48.9 +/- 13.5 yr) healthy subjects were also studied. Clinical ratings of dyspnea obtained in patients for MRC (range, 0 to 4), OCD (range, 23 to 98), and BDI (range, 0.5 to 12.0) were all highly interrelated (rs = 0.79, -0.83, and -0.71; p less than 0.001 for all comparisons). Exponents of the psychophysical power function for resistive breathing loads were similar for patients with OAD (0.57 +/- 0.27) and control subjects (0.63 +/- 0.18) (p = NS). Clinical dyspnea scores were significantly correlated with both FEV1 and FVC; however, neither dyspnea ratings nor lung function were significantly related to the exponent for added breathing loads in the patient group. These comparisons indicate that in patients with symptomatic OAD, clinical methods for rating dyspnea are interrelated and are correlated with lung function, but are independent of perception of resistive breathing loads.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the role of gold mining exposure (an environmental factor) and of various clinical features recorded early in a miner's career (host factors), a case control study was carried out as follows. From whole lung sections made routinely at all full autopsy examinations on South African gold miners, we selected 44 cases of emphysema and 42 controls without emphysema from among men 51 to 71 yr of age who died during 1980 and 1981. Exposure information was gathered and clinical records were reviewed for smoking history, symptoms, and the presence of rhonchi by decade before death. The presence and grade of silicosis (abstracted from the routine autopsy reports) was similar in both groups; so was bronchitis in the 49 cases and controls with histologic material adequate for review. However, cases were on average older, had worked more shifts in high dust, and had smoked more than controls; they had also exhibited symptoms and rhonchi more frequently before 1950, i.e., 30 yr before death. When these factors were examined in a multiple logistic regression analysis, shifts worked in high dust, smoking, and age were all shown to be strong and independent predictors of emphysema at autopsy; prediction, however, was not improved by addition of any of the clinical features examined. These findings agree with previous cross-sectional studies in South African gold miners showing an exposure response relationship between mining service and air-flow limitation measured by lung function tests in life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Employed and retired male workers with greater than or equal to 10 yr of service who were born on or after January 1, 1900 and who died between March 1, 1981 and February 28, 1982 were eligible. We collected 87% of the death certificates from 15,059 deaths reported to the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). Cases of lung cancer (1,256) were matched to controls by age (+/- 2.5 yr) and date of death (+/- 31 days). Potential exposure to diesel exhaust was assigned based on an industrial hygiene evaluation of jobs and work areas. Each subject's work history was determined from a yearly job report filed by his employer with the RRB from 1959 until death or retirement. Asbestos exposure prior to 1959 was categorized by the job held in 1959, the end of the steam locomotive era, or by the last job held if retirement occurred before 1959. Smoking histories were obtained by questionnaire from next of kin. Using multiple conditional logistic regression analysis to adjust for smoking and asbestos exposure, workers 64 yr of age or younger at the time of death with work in a diesel exhaust exposed job for 20 yr had a significantly increased relative odds (odds ratio = 1.41, 95% Cl = 1.06, 1.88) of lung cancer. No effect of diesel exhaust exposure was seen in workers 65 yr of age or older because many of these men retired shortly after the transition to diesel-powered locomotives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of the paucity of scientific data concerning the inhalation toxicity of this compound in humans, we determined the symptoms and alterations in pulmonary function resulting from inhalation for 1 h of 3 parts per million formaldehyde in a controlled environmental chamber. The protocol consisted of randomized exposure of each subject to clean air or 3.0 ppm HCHO on 2 separate days. Twenty-two healthy normal subjects engaged in intermittent heavy exercise (VE = 65 L/min) and 16 asthmatic subjects performed intermittent moderate exercise (VE = 37 L/min). Symptoms and pulmonary function were assessed during the time course of exposure; nonspecific airway reactivity was assessed after exposure. Both groups exhibited similar, significant (p less than 0.01) increases in perceived odor, nose/throat irritation, and eye irritation throughout the exposure. The normal group had the following statistically significant (p less than 0.02) lower pulmonary functions after 55 min of exposure to formaldehyde as compared to clean air: 3.8% in FEV1, 2.6% in FVC, and 2.8% in FEV3. The asthmatic group showed no statistically significant decrements in pulmonary function. Five of 38 subjects studied had decrements in FEV1 greater than 10%. In conclusion, acute exposure to 3 ppm HCHO produced: consistent irritant symptoms in both normal and asthmatic subjects, small decreases in pulmonary function in normal subjects engaging in heavy exercise, and clinically significant responses (defined here as decrements in FEU1 greater than 10) in 13% of the study population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the effect of a single intravascular bolus of synthetic PAF (0.5 microgram/kg) on airway responsiveness to aerosolized histamine in 8 chronically instrumented awake sheep. Lung mechanics were assessed by whole-body plethysmography. Histamine dose-response curves were performed before and 4 h after PAF administration. PAF induced a 60% fall in dynamic compliance and a three-fold increase in resistance to air flow across the lung within 5 min. All animals tested became more responsive to aerosol histamine 4 h after PAF as evidenced by a fall in ED65Cdyn from 9.45 mg/ml before to 4.34 mg/ml. There was no correlation between the initial Cdyn or the Cdyn measured just prior to the second bronchial challenge and the calculated alteration in responsiveness. Animals displaying the greatest initial responsiveness to aerosol histamine also manifested the greatest alteration in lung mechanics after intravascular PAF (r = 0.92). We conclude that PAF consistently alters lung mechanics and increases airway responsiveness in awake sheep, and aerosol histamine responsiveness correlates with the maximal response to intravenous PAF.\r"

Thirteen subjects smoked tobacco cigarettes only (TS) (mean +/- SE: 17.4 +/- 5.5 pack-years). Thirty subjects smoked marijuana; of these, 14 smoked marijuana only (MS) (149.1 +/- 102.7 joint-years) and 16 smoked marijuana and tobacco (MTS) (43.3 +/- 7.2 joint-years and 18.4 +/- 3.2 pack-years). Cell counts were expressed as total number recovered and as number of cells per milliliter of BAL fluid returned. Cell differentials were performed on Giemsa-stained cytopreps. Total cell number was significantly increased in the MTS, TS, and MS compared with that in the NS (p less than 0.01). Heavy tobacco smoking (greater than 10 pack-years) was associated with higher total cell numbers in BAL than was light tobacco smoking (less than 10 pack-years). The MTS had a higher total BAL cell yield per milliliter than did the TS or the MS (p less than 0.004). Marijuana smoking had a significant effect on cell yield independent of the presence or absence of concomitant tobacco smoking (p less than 0.05). Macrophages were the predominant cells in the BAL of TS, MS, and MTS, as well as in the BAL of NS (greater than or equal to 90%).

  ".W": "The quantitation of substances in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lower respiratory tract, as obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), is not precise because of the variable dilution of the ELF by the instilled lavage fluid. It has been reported that the absolute concentration of proteins in ELF can be determined by using the ratio of urea concentration in BAL fluid to that in serum as a method to calculate the volume of ELF recovered by BAL. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the error caused by diffusion of urea into the instilled lavage fluid can be minimized by instilling only 100 ml (5 X 20 ml) of saline rather than 300 ml (6 X 50 ml). We tested the validity of this method by collecting and individually analyzing aliquots from 2 different BAL protocols--a 100-ml (5 X 20 ml) BAL and a 300-ml (6 X 50 ml) BAL--performed in 6 healthy, nonsmoking subjects. Total protein, albumin, and urea were measured in each aliquot and in pooled fluid from each BAL procedure, and urea was measured in serum. In the 300-ml BAL, total protein and albumin concentrations tended to decrease progressively from the second to the sixth aliquots. In contrast, the urea concentration increased progressively from the first to the sixth aliquots. The concentration of albumin in ELF, calculated from the concentration of urea and albumin in each BAL aliquot, tended to decrease in each successive aliquot, becoming significant by the fourth aliquot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We sought a similar reflex mechanism in humans. Nine normal male volunteers 20 to 28 yr of age underwent 3 successive overnight sleep studies: a control study (C); a study in which selective topical oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA) was achieved prior to sleep using a 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivocaine solution; a study in which selective nasal anesthesia (NA) was achieved prior to sleep using a mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.25% bupivocaine solutions instilled into the nose while the nasal airway was positioned as the most dependent part of the upper airway. Total sleep times were similar during the 3 study nights as were the amounts of slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) differed significantly between the 3 study nights [13(3.8), mean (SEM), during OPA as compared to 3(1.8) during C and 7(2.5) during NA; p less than 0.01 by ANOVA] and were most frequent during REM sleep.

Abdominal paradox has been proposed as a valuable clinical index of fatigue and thus its presence may lead to curtailment of weaning trials. However, sensitivity and specificity of this sign as a predictor of weaning outcome is unknown. We hypothesize that abnormal ribcage-abdominal (RC-Ab) motion is a common finding in the early stages of weaning and its presence does not inevitably imply an unsuccessful weaning outcome. We tested this hypothesis in patients undergoing a weaning trial: one group had a successful weaning outcome and were extubated (n = 10) and the other group failed the trial (n = 7). Normal RC-Ab motion was separately characterized in 17 healthy subjects. Employing a calibrated respiratory inductive plethysmograph, quantitative assessment of asynchrony and paradox was obtained by computing several indices from series of breaths at fixed time periods using the Konno-Mead method of analysis. During the weaning trial, both groups of patients displayed significant increases in asynchrony and Ab paradox compared to normal values. As a group, patients who failed the trial displayed significantly greater asynchrony and paradox of the RC and Ab than patients with a successful outcome. However, there was considerable overlap between the individual patients in the 2 study groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mucosal addition of probenecid had 2 effects: at low concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 mM), probenecid increased short-circuit current (Isc) and net Cl secretion, whereas higher concentrations (5 and 10 mM) decreased Isc and net Cl secretion; 1 mM probenecid had no effect. The change in Isc was accounted for entirely by the change in the net Cl secretion. The effects were rapidly reversible and even after prolonged exposure were not associated with any change in the paracellular pathway as evidenced by mannitol fluxes. Submucosal addition of probenecid produced a significant decrease in Isc and net Cl secretion only at 10 mM, and the effect was delayed, suggesting movement of some of the probenecid into the mucosal bath. We conclude from these experiments that probenecid at concentrations greater than 1 mM inhibits Cl secretion in canine tracheal epithelium; the effect is primarily from the mucosal side and is reversible. Because probenecid is structurally related to a group of analogs of benzoic acid that inhibit the Cl conductance at the apical membrane, we suggest that probenecid might also block the electrically conductive Cl exit pathway in the apical cell membrane.\r"

No charge differences were noted by isoelectric focusing. Molecular weight analysis of HLA-DR from AM revealed a complex pattern of radioactive spots differing slightly in molecular weight. This pattern was apparent in both the alpha and the beta chains. In contrast, a simpler pattern without the slight molecular weight differences was noted in HLA-DR from BM. The differences were eliminated by labeling AM and BM in the presence of tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of protein-carbohydrate linkages of the N-glycosidic type. Thus, it appears that neutral, N-linked carbohydrate moieties account for the differences in HLA-DR molecules between AM and BM. The differential glycosylation of HLA-DR molecules in AM and BM may relate to mononuclear phagocyte development as well as antigen-presenting function.\r"

The basic biologic mechanisms through which inhaled particles bind to macrophage membranes and subsequently are phagocytized remain unclear. We hypothesize that positively charged particles bind to negatively charged sialic acid (SA) residues on macrophage membranes. Alveolar Macrophages (AM) were collected by saline lavage from normal rat lungs. The cells adhered to plastic coverslips in serum-free phosphate buffered saline at 37 degrees C for 45 min and then were maintained at 4 degrees C for the binding experiments. Even distribution of SA groups on AM surfaces was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to 50 nm gold spheres. The WGA is a lectin that binds specifically to sialic acid, and pretreatment of AM with this lectin prevented the binding of positively charged carbonyl iron (C-Fe) spheres, aluminum (Al) spheres, and chrysotile asbestos fibers to AM surfaces. Limulus protein, another lectin with binding specificity for SA, similarly blocked the binding of positively charged spheres and chrysotile asbestos fibers but not negatively charged glass spheres or crocidolite asbestos fibers. Con A and ricin, lectins that bind to mannose and galactose residues, respectively, did not block particle binding. When both positively charged iron spheres and negatively charged glass spheres were prebound to AM membranes, subsequent treatment with WGA displaced only the positively charged spheres from macrophage surfaces. Con A and ricin had no effect on prebound positively charged C-Fe and Al spheres.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They can limit pulmonary metastases in vivo and thus might be important effectors of tumor defense in human lung. Lymphocytes were purified from whole lung specimens obtained from patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection, and their NK activity was compared with that of lymphocytes purified from normal lung specimens obtained from cadavers undergoing medicolegal autopsy. The NK activity of pulmonary lymphocytes obtained from the patients with lung cancer was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than the NK activity of normal lungs. This reduction occurred despite high levels of blood NK activity in the patients with cancer, suggesting that NK cells might be locally suppressed in the lungs of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. Because human pulmonary macrophages (PM) are known to be potent inhibitors of NK function, we investigated the role that PM might play in the reduction of NK activity in these patients. The PM obtained from the patients with lung cancer released soluble inhibitors of NK activity when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Release of these inhibitors was blocked by indomethacin, strongly suggesting a role for arachidonic acid metabolites as an inhibitor of pulmonary NK function. Inhibition of NK function by PM may occur in vivo, as a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.71, p less than 0.001) existed between the NK activity of lymphocytes obtained from a lung and the number of PM present in the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87239690\r", 
  ".W": "Since the alveolar macrophage (AM) resides in an environment made unique by the presence of pulmonary surfactant, we studied the effect of constituents of pulmonary surfactant on the migration of these cells in vitro. Whole pulmonary surfactant, surfactant phospholipids, and a delipidated preparation of surfactant consisting mainly of protein were tested for their effect on AM migration. Migration was measured in multiwell chemotaxis chambers with endotoxin-activated rat serum (EARS) as the stimulus. The delipidated surfactant material (DSM) markedly augmented the migration of rat AM. Enhancement was seen only when migration was stimulated with EARS. Augmentation of stimulated migration occurred over a wide range of protein concentrations in DSM (3.5 to 56 micrograms/ml) in a dose-dependent fashion. Rat AM that were preincubated with DSM and then tested in the chemotaxis assay without DSM showed increased migration towards EARS when compared with AM preincubated in buffer alone. The enhancing effect of DSM on AM migration was significantly diminished by heating the DSM and by enzymatic digestion with trypsin, suggesting that the active constituent in DSM was protein. Thus, it appears that proteins isolated from pulmonary surfactant augment the stimulated migration of AM via an interaction between the protein and the macrophage. Although the identity of these proteins remains to be elucidated, it is unlikely they include albumin since purified rat serum albumin in concentrations comparable to that of protein in DSM did not enhance the stimulated migration of AM. These results represent further confirmation that constituents of surfactant modulate the clearance function of AM in vitro. Thus, it is likely that surfactant plays a role in lung defense mediated by AM.\r"

Using combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and an oxygen-18-labeled 5-HETE internal standard, a method of analysis has been developed that involves conversion of 5-HETE into its pentafluorobenzyl ester (PFB) which is purified and separated from 12- and 15-HETE PFB esters by thin-layer chromatography. Following isolation and trimethylsilyl ether formation, analysis on a short 5-m capillary GC column circumvents problems of thermal degradation. Negative ion chemical ionization results in abundant production of carboxylate anions (RCOO-) with little subsequent fragmentation; as little as 40 pg of 5-HETE (s/n approximately 10:1) could be detected in 5 ng of 1,1-[18O]2-5-HETE. Studies of the isolated rat lung perfused with a 4% albumin buffer revealed a significant increase in 5-HETE (750 pg/ml perfusate) when injury was induced by addition of glucose oxidase to the perfusion buffer (0.6 U/ml). This stimulated production of 5-HETE could be reversed by prior perfusion of the lung with the drug piriprost, an inhibitor of the 5-lipoxygenase cascade.\r"

The ability of mast cells to generate or release the vasoactive/spasmogenic mediators histamine, adenosine, PGD2, sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor is thought relevant to immediate bronchospastic responses in association with mucus secretion and airway edema. Mast cell elaboration of chemotactic factors and release of enzymes with both tryptic and chymotryptic specificity is held responsible for later reactions in which airway inflammation is prominent and nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity is present. Recent evidence indicates that in addition to direct effect of these mast cell products some mast cell mediators themselves modulate inflammatory mediator production. Thus, adenosine, by interacting with A2 receptors on the surface of mast cells, markedly augments mast cell release of preformed granule associated mediators. Mast cell-derived chemotactic factors, exemplified by low molecular weight eosinophil directed molecules, can induce cell specific synthesis of inflammatory lipids such as platelet-activating factor. These findings only begin to suggest the richness of possibilities for mast cell regulation of the inflammatory response and underline the reality that the inflammatory response in lung as in all tissue is extremely complex and dependent upon cell-to-cell communication for its full expression.\r"

  ".W": "The bronchial arteries extend to all lung structures in man with the exception only of the alveolar wall. In addition to providing nutrition to the lungs, the bronchial vessels can also function as a hemodynamic and gas-exchange system due to anastomoses with the pulmonary arteries; they also play a significant role in controlling the clearance of chemical mediators, regulating the development of airway wall edema, and controlling heat exchange in the tracheobronchial tree. We have measured the effects of inflammatory and other mediators on tracheal mucosal thickness and the changes in tracheal vascular resistance in dogs. Bradykinin, histamine, and methacholine had large \"vasodilator\" effects, decreasing vascular resistance, and they also clearly increased the thickness of the mucosa. Substance P, VIP, PGF2 alpha, and PGE1 had as large a response on vascular resistance as the drugs mentioned above, but only had small effects in increasing tracheal mucosal thickness. Salbutamol fell between these 2 groups with regard to the pattern of response. Phenylephrine had an opposite action, causing an increase in vascular resistance and a decrease in mucosal thickness. Despite the vasodilatation and the increase in vascular permeability due to vasoactive drugs, the changes in mucosal thickness were rather small and could not be correlated with the decreases in vascular resistance due to the different drugs. Such changes are unlikely to have an appreciable effect on tracheal airway resistance. The change in mucosal thickness may be more significant in those parts of the airways where the ratio of change in mucosal thickness to the radius of adjacent lumen is large, such as the nose and small conducting airways.\r"

The risk for gallbladder cancer was increased threefold, but the increase was significant only in men (p = 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 30.0). The absolute incidence and the total number of men and women who developed gallbladder cancer was low (n = 5). The actual incidence of other gastrointestinal malignancies in our cohort with gallstones did not exceed the expected incidence in the general population of Rochester, Minnesota. Specifically, the risk for colon cancer was not increased, even after cholecystectomy. These data support an association between cholelithiasis and gallbladder cancer. We found, however, no association between cholelithiasis or cholecystectomy and any other gastrointestinal malignancy.\r"

The mortality rate in the hypocalcemic patients with sepsis (50%) was higher than that in the normocalcemic patients with sepsis (29%). Only patients with gram-negative sepsis became hypocalcemic, and hypocalcemia contributed to hypotension in 7 of the 12 hypocalcemic patients. Serum calcium concentrations returned to normal in each of those patients with sepsis who survived. Hypocalcemia during sepsis occurred in previously normocalcemic patients and was multifactorial in origin, resulting from acquired parathyroid gland insufficiency, renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency, and acquired calcitriol resistance. We conclude that the hypocalcemia of sepsis is associated with a high mortality rate and usually occurs in previously normocalcemic patients who acquire a defect in the parathyroid-vitamin D axis.\r"

Protein S is found in two forms in plasma as free and functionally active protein S, and complexed to C4b-binding protein. When compared with controls, patients with nephrotic syndrome had reduced functional levels of protein S (69% +/- 27% [SD], p less than 0.001) despite having elevated levels of total protein S antigen (139% +/- 42%, p less than 0.001). Decreased protein S activity was caused by significant reductions in free (active) protein S levels (90% +/- 38%, p less than 0.05) due to the selective urinary loss of free protein S and elevation of C4b-binding protein levels (170% +/- 52%, p less than 0.001) that favors complex formation; and in the specific activity of the circulating free protein S (0.76; p less than 0.001). Along with this reduction in specific activity, we noted the abnormal electrophoretic mobility of the protein S in the presence of calcium ions. We conclude that acquired protein S deficiency occurs in the nephrotic syndrome and may be a risk factor for the development of the thromboembolic complications.\r"

The most prominent clinical features were abnormal eye movements, diminished reflexes, decreased vibratory and position sense, ataxia, and muscle weakness. Treatment with intramuscular injections of vitamin E partially corrected the neurologic deficits. Vitamin E absorption tests documented severe malabsorption, which was later alleviated by the addition of dessicated ox bile to the regimen of alpha-tocopheryl acetate. These studies suggest that a decreased intraluminal concentration of bile salts is an important factor in the development of severe vitamin E deficiency and in the poor response to oral replacement therapy that is seen in some patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Although the commonest familial form of primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroid hyperplasia, a few families have manifested parathyroid adenomas. We describe a family in which four members developed cystic parathyroid adenomas. Although calcium levels returned to normal after resection of the adenoma, a second adenoma would often develop several years later (we have termed this temporal sequence adenomatosis). Each adenoma had a cystic histologic appearance, and three of four normal-sized parathyroid glands also contained many cysts. No other endocrine tumors have appeared, but in three patients the hyperparathyroidism was complicated by fibrous maxillary or mandibular tumors that resembled ossifying fibromas rather than the brown tumors generally found in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Each patient with an adenoma was hypercalciuric, but two were obligate carriers of hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. This familial occurrence of the rare cystic parathyroid adenoma suggests the presence of a distinct hereditary syndrome. The genetic basis may be the simultaneous inheritance of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and another trait that may increase the urinary excretion of calcium.\r"

This growth represents an increase of 121% for a 20-year period, during which time the population of the United States is expected to increase only 19%. Thus, the number of adults older than 17 years per active internist will drop from 2464 to 1401. Between 1978 and 1998, we expect the number of subspecialty internists to increase 206%, in contrast to a 77% increase expected for general internists. The proportion of female internists will increase from 7% to 21%. The proportion of the active internist population who are foreign medical graduates will remain stable at about 21% throughout the projection period, but within this group the proportion who are United States citizens is expected to increase while the proportion who are foreign citizens is expected to decline.\r"

Retinol palmitate 0.5% ointment was applied bid to the right eyes of five rabbits and plain petrolatum ointment was applied to the left eyes. After 13 days, no significant increase in wound strength was found between eyes. However, retinol palmitate 0.1% ointment, when applied tid to the right eyes of nine incised rabbits, was found to double wound strength at 13 days (P less than .0001). This latter strength was repeated in double-blind fashion in five rabbits. After 13 days, wound strength was increased by a factor of 1.45 (P less than .05). Thus we conclude that retinol palmitate 0.1% ointment increases wound strength in healing corneoscleral incisions.\r"

Using these equations, it is possible to show that small variations in the radius of the eyeball can have a significant effect on the surgical amount. It is also shown that for a recession, variations in the distance between the point where the sutures are tied on the muscle, before disinserting it, and the original insertion point of the muscle can have a significant effect on the final outcome of the surgery.\r"

The most common pathogenesis of disturbed autonomic function in central nervous system diseases is degeneration of the intermediolateral cell columns (progressive autonomic failure) or disease or damage to descending pathways that synapse on the intermediolateral column cells (spinal cord lesions, cerebrovascular disease, brainstem tumors, multiple sclerosis). The peripheral autonomic nervous system may be damaged in isolation in the acute and subacute autonomic neuropathies or in association with a generalized peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral neuropathies most likely to cause severe autonomic disturbance are those in which small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers are damaged in the baroreflex afferents, the vagal efferents to the heart, and the sympathetic efferent pathways to the mesenteric vascular bed. Acute demyelination of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the Guillain-Barre syndrome may also cause acute autonomic dysfunction. Although autonomic disturbances may occur in other types of peripheral neuropathy, they are rarely clinically important.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system attends traumatic brain injury, but the association of the severity of neurological impairment and recovery with the extent of sympathetic nervous system stimulation is poorly defined. In this study, plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (DA) levels were measured serially in 33 patients with traumatic brain injury and compared with the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), which was obtained concurrently. A catecholamine gradient that reflected the extent of brain injury was demonstrated within 48 hours of the injury. In patients with a GCS of 3 to 4, NE and E levels increased four- to fivefold and the DA level increased threefold above normal (NE, 1686 +/- 416 pg/ml; E, 430 +/- 172 pg/ml; DA, 236 +/- 110 pg/ml), while patients with mild brain injury (GCS, greater than 11) had slightly elevated or normal levels. Patients with marked (GCS, 5 to 7) and moderate (GCS, 8 to 10) traumatic brain injuries had intermediate levels. The prognostic value of determining admission levels of NE was shown in patients with an admission GCS of 3 to 4 1 week after injury. Patients with severe and unchanging neurological impairment 1 week after injury had markedly elevated initial NE levels (2,176 +/- 531 pg/ml), whereas initial NE levels (544 +/- 89 pg/ml) were only mildly elevated in patients who improved to a GCS of greater than 11. These data indicate that markedly elevated NE levels predict outcome in patients with comparable neurological deficits. Thus levels of circulating catecholamines are excellent endogenous and readily quantifiable markers that appear to reflect the extent of brain injury and that may predict the likelihood of recovery.\r"

Pain in the buttocks and posterior thighs was a prominent initial symptom in the 3 patients with unprovoked attacks. The main clinical features were profound impairment of bowel and bladder function and of perianal and perineal sensation (S3 to S5 segments). There was sensory and motor impairment in the legs of variable extent, most marked in the S1 and S2 segments, but extending as high as L4 in 2 patients. In 1 patient, ischemic changes in the conus medullaris were confirmed post mortem. Ischemia confined to the caudal tip of the spinal cord is rare, and an underlying anomaly of the pattern of arterial supply is a likely predisposing factor. Four patients had partial return of function over a period of weeks.\r"

Cysteamine, an agent which selectively and reversibly depletes brain somatostatin stores, had a biphasic action. An early proconvulsant effect was seen within a few hours, consisting of prolonged electrographic seizures in the hippocampus and more severe behavioral convulsions. A later anticonvulsant effect, maximal at 1 to 2 days and dissipating within a week, was manifested by less intense behavioral convulsions without change in the duration of electrical seizure activity. Both effects were dose-dependent. No change in afterdischarge thresholds was detected at any time after the administration of cysteamine. Intraventricular administration of somatostatin to animals with behavioral seizures attenuated by cysteamine treatment restored the responses to precysteamine levels. We conclude that somatostatin facilitates the spread of seizures over limbic circuits from a region of focal seizure initiation.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and seventeen children and 41 teachers in day nurseries were screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV) viruria over a period of one year. Thirty two (27%) children and two (5%) teachers were found to be excreting virus on at least one occasion. Restriction endonuclease typing showed that virus strains isolated from the children were dissimilar, with the exception of those from sibling pairs and one unrelated pair. The virus isolate from one teacher matched those from two unrelated children, while the isolate from another teacher could not be distinguished from that from a sibling pair. The CMV serological state of the 41 teachers was not significantly different from 500 matched controls and no seroconversions occurred. It is concluded that although transmission of CMV among children and teachers may occur in day nurseries, the dissimilarity of most of the virus strains indicates that infection predominantly occurs outside. Furthermore, teachers in day nurseries showed no evidence of an increased risk of past CMV infection when compared with matched controls.\r"

Thirty six children developed eczema, which was often associated with a positive result of a skin test to ingestants in the first year and inhalants by the fifth year. Thirty two children developed one or more episodes of wheeze. Fifteen children wheezed once only, and not all of these developed atopy. No pattern of respiratory infection in early life was characteristic of children with recurrent wheeze. There was a significant difference in parental smoking habits between children with and without episodes of wheeze at the fifth birthday. No protective effect of breast feeding could be shown. The development of allergic disease in susceptible children is influenced by many environmental factors. Advice to families about reduction of environmental allergens continues to pose problems, but parents should be advised to avoid smoking in the child's presence.\r"

Each child had his own constant set of prodromal findings. A significant age related increase in serum IgE concentrations was observed in these patients. No such relation was observed in children with an acute onset of attack of asthma without any preceding symptoms. We suggest that awareness of these prodromal symptoms may lead to an early introduction of treatment, thus avoiding or abbreviating some of the acute attacks of asthma.\r"

Results showed that a conventional powdered pancreatic extract (Pancrex V) required a high dosage to achieve reasonable improvement in fat and nitrogen absorption (200 mg/kg body weight/day on average) and rarely restored digestion to normal. Bicarbonate (5.2 g/m2 body surface/day) slightly enhanced the enzymatic activity of the powdered extract, this being more apparent in those with more severe steatorrhoea. There was no advantage in providing the extract in microgranules protected by cellulose acetatephthalate. A product based on fungal lipase and protease (Krebsilasi) proved to be ineffective in correcting fat and protein absorption. The two recent products prepared in pH sensitive microspheres (Pancrex V microspheres and Pancreas-Prolipase) had similar advantages in digestive activity. Compared with the traditional preparations, they offered a number of practical advantages, including a smaller number of capsules (particularly Pancrex V microspheres) and improved palatability.\r"

We observed 51 cases with raised blood concentrations of PIVKA-II (greater than 4 AU/ml), nine of whom showed very high concentrations (greater than 20 AU/ml). For infants who did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis at birth, the incidence of the PIVKA-II test yielding positive results was significantly higher in those solely breast fed (0.51%) compared with those fed formula milk (0.18%). Among solely breast fed infants, the incidence of a very high result of the PIVKA-II test was 0.14% in those who had not received vitamin K prophylaxis at birth, 0.04% in those who received 2 mg orally, and 0.03% in those who received 2 mg orally plus a further dose of 2-4 mg orally at 7 days. Thus vitamin K prophylaxis at birth did not completely prevent vitamin K deficiency at 1 month. We administered vitamin K therapeutically to all infants whose PIVKA-II test yielded a positive result at 1 month. Only one infant with a positive result developed late neonatal intracranial haemorrhage.\r"

There was no discernible trend in overall prevalence, but there was a highly significant upward trend in the prevalence of cerebral palsy among low birthweight infants, which was evident for all the major types of cerebral palsy. It is postulated that this is due to improved survival rather than a real change in incidence. Alternatively, because the register was compiled from health service records, a diagnostic access bias from improved follow up of low birthweight infants may have led to an apparent increase in prevalence.\r"

The peripheral airway response was assessed by the change in maximum flow at functional residual capacity (Vmax FRC) and the upper and central airway response by the change in specific airways resistance. The significant reduction in specific airways resistance after treatment with ipratropium bromide signified an improvement in central and upper airway function. No change was found, however, in Vmax FRC and hence in peripheral airway function. It seems that, as in older subjects, inhaled antimuscarinic, anticholinergic drugs have their maximum effect on the large airways, and this may explain their lack of effect in the management of acute bronchiolitis.\r"

Faeces after breast feeding for three days showed detectable titres of IgA and secretory component, with further increases by seven days. There was a positive correlation between titres of secretory component in breast milk and in faeces. To clarify the mechanism of high anti-rotavirus activity in breast milk, ratios of rotavirus specific IgA in maternal serum samples to breast milk were calculated and compared with those that were herpes simplex virus specific. Significantly higher concentrations were obtained for the herpes simplex virus specific samples, indicating that anti-rotavirus IgA is selectively produced in breast tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Acute hemorrhagic ulceration of the gastric mucosa is seen frequently in patients with hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock. Although such lesions clearly are related to regional gastric ischemia, little attention has been directed at the underlying mechanism(s) mediating the ischemia itself. To this end, anesthetized pigs were subjected to sustained cardiogenic shock (mild hemorrhage and pericardial tamponade) such that cardiac output was reduced to 38 +/- 1% of the baseline level for 4 hours, followed by release of the tamponade, reinfusion of the shed blood, and resuscitation for 2 hours. During the period of shock, there was profound regional gastric ischemia, resulting from severe and disproportionate gastric vasoconstriction. \"Blinded\" gross and microscopic evaluation of the stomachs removed after the experiment revealed severe mucosal ischemic necrosis, hemorrhage, and ulceration, whereas sham-operated pigs showed no lesions. The characteristics of this model therefore mimic the essential features of the gastric \"stress ulceration\" syndrome. Prior confirmed total alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine failed to alter these features significantly. In contrast, prior ablation of the renin-angiotensin axis, whether by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with teprotide or by bilateral nephrectomy, significantly and substantially ameliorated the ischemia, vasospasm, and mucosal injury. In this model of cardiogenic shock, acute gastric mucosal \"stress ulceration\" is caused by a disproportionately severe regional gastric ischemia resulting from selective splanchnic vasospasm that is unaffected by sympathetic blockade but abolished by prior ablation of the renin-angiotensin axis. Like nonocclusive small bowel ischemia, ischemic colitis, and the \"shock liver\" syndrome, gastric \"stress ulceration\" is yet another component of the multiple splanchnic organ failure syndrome that appears to be mediated primarily by the remarkable sensitivity of the splanchnic vascular bed to the renin-angiotensin axis.\r"

The authors have examined their more recent experience with these relatively rare lesions. Twenty-eight patients (13 with lymphoma, 15 with sarcoma) have been treated at the Vanderbilt University and the Metropolitan Nashville General Hospital since 1976. There were eight men in the group with lymphoma and six in the group with sarcoma. The average age for patients with lymphoma was 66 years; the average age was 57 years in the patients with sarcoma. Seven patients with lymphoma and eight patients with sarcoma had been treated for 6 months to 3 years for presumed peptic ulcer disease. Eight of these 15 patients were found to have perforated tumors at the time of surgical exploration. Three patients (all in the group with sarcoma) had metastatic liver disease or peritoneal implants at the time of diagnosis. Treatment for most patients included resection of the tumor, followed by chemotherapy or radiation in cases of tumor perforation or metastatic disease. The survival rate for patients with lymphoma has averaged 5.5 years, with a 55% 5-year survival rate. Patients with cleaved cell tumors survived longer than those with other types of lymphoma. In the group with sarcoma, the survival rate has been 3.1 years on the average, with a 21% 5-year survival rate.\r"

  ".W": "At the Mayo Clinic, from 1970 through 1979, 84 patients (52 males and 32 females) had abdominal exploration for primary gastric lymphoma. All patients were observed a minimum of 5 years or until death. The histologic findings for all 84 patients were reviewed. Forty-four patients had \"curative resection,\" and 40 patients had either biopsy alone or a palliative procedure. The probability of surviving 5 years was 75% for patients after potentially curative resection and 32% for patients after biopsy and palliation (p less than 0.001). The operative mortality rate was 5% overall and 2% after potentially curative resection. Increased tumor size (p less than 0.02), increased tumor penetration (p less than 0.01), and lymph node involvement (p less than 0.02) decreased the probability of survival, whereas histologic classification did not affect survival. Radiation therapy after surgery did not significantly affect the survival rate for the entire group or the survival rate for patients who had potentially curative resection. Resectability was associated with increased patient survival--independent of other prognostic factors--when our experience was analyzed by the Cox proportional-hazards model (p less than 0.005). It was concluded that an aggressive surgical attitude in the treatment of primary gastric lymphoma is warranted. The role of radiotherapy remains in question.\r"

  ".U": "87240457\r", 
  ".W": "The authors have previously identified two groups of patients with gallstones: those whose gallbladders contract the same as those of normal volunteers and show an increased sensitivity to endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) (\"contractors\") and those whose gallbladders are relatively unresponsive (\"noncontractors\"). To define the mechanism responsible for these differences in contractility, the authors have measured CCK receptors on gallbladder muscle of patients with gallstones. Twenty-three patients with gallstones and 10 healthy volunteers (controls) fasted overnight. Simultaneous plasma samples for radioimmunoassay of CCK release and ultrasonographic measurements of gallbladder volume were obtained before and at intervals for 60 minutes after ingestion of Lipomul. Patients with gallstones had cholecystectomy, and CCK receptors were determined on cell membranes from gallbladder specimens by use of radiolabeled analogs of CCK-8-SO4. Histologic sections were graded for the degree of inflammation and scarring. Thirteen patients with gallstones were identified as contractors and 10 as noncontractors. Basal gallbladder volumes were not significantly different between patients in either group. The total integrated output of CCK for contractors was 1.6 +/- 0.2 ng X min/ml compared with 5.5 +/- 1.2 ng X min/ml for controls, while the integrated output for noncontractors was 11.1 +/- 2.1 ng X min/ml. Contractors had a higher number of CCK-binding sites (27.6 +/- 6.8 fmol/mg protein) than did noncontractors (4.8 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg protein). CCK receptors in gallbladders of all patients with gallstones correlated closely with gallbladder motility (y = 1.149, x = 0.624, r = 0.7, p less than 0.001). Although contractors had more mild inflammation and scarring, 40% of noncontractors had mild inflammation and scarring; there was no correlation. A decrease in CCK receptors may be an early event in the pathogenesis of gallstone formation by causing a decrease in gallbladder motility in some patients.\r"

Eleven patients (58%) incurred their injuries during cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis (average age--56 years); seven patients (37%) received their injuries during elective cholecystectomies (average age--24 years); and in one patient (5%) the injury occurred during gastrectomy. In group I were eight patients in whom injuries were recognized and repaired intraoperatively during their initial operations. Seven of these patients (88%) had primary duct reanastomoses, and one patient had a choledochoduodenostomy. All healed without further surgery, and none later had cholangitis develop. In group II were 11 patients diagnosed and reoperated later after surgery (mean time until diagnosis, 12 days). Seven of these patients (64%) were managed with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomies or choledochojejunostomies. Four patients had cholangitis develop after surgery: two had demonstrable anastomic stenosis and two had no stenosis. Three of these four patients (75%) who had cholangitis develop did not have stents used in their repairs. The overall mortality rate in this series of 19 patients was 11%. The major risk factors for biliary tract injury were the presence of acute cholecystitis and of anatomically small biliary ducts. For this latter reason, younger patients who had elective cholecystectomies were particularly at risk. In delayed repair, the use of internal stents appeared to be useful in preventing the later development of stenosis and/or cholangitis; however, recurrent cholangitis developed in two patients who did not have demonstrable anastomotic stenoses.\r"

Forty-nine benign neoplastic polyps were removed from 21% of the patients. The examination was well tolerated in 93% of these patients who received no medications. Resident endoscopists who had performed more than 15 examinations were more likely to reach 50 cm (79%) than those with less experience. The authors conclude that surgical residents are able to safely and effectively screen for colorectal neoplasms with a flexible sigmoidoscope when supervised.\r"

  ".W": "The subject of management of patients after endoscopic removal of cancerous adenomas is controversial. A retrospective review of 126 lesions in 121 patients who had had colonoscopic polypectomy of malignant lesions between 1971 and 1985 was used to determine the criteria for colon resection. Invasive cancer was identified in 80 patients, while 41 patients had carcinoma in situ. A synchronous colon cancer was found in five of the 121 patients. The patients who had carcinoma in situ had no evidence of residual tumor or metastatic disease on subsequent follow-up (colon resection in three patients and endoscopic surveillance in 38 patients). Of the 80 patients with invasive cancer, 44 had subsequent colon resection, and 34 of these had no evidence of tumor in the resected bowel or mesenteric lymph nodes. Ten patients had residual tumor, metastatic cancer to regional lymph nodes, or both. Each of the 10 had at least one of the following indications of inadequate resection or dissemination of disease to local lymph nodes (the first indication is a macroscopic evaluation, while the remaining four are all microscopic): incomplete excision, poorly differentiated tumor, invasion of the line of resection, invasion of the polyp stalk, and invasion of venous or lymphatic channels. Present recommendations for patient management after endoscopic removal of an invasive malignant adenoma should include colon resection with regional lymphadenectomy for patients with one or more of these five criteria. Patients without any of these risk factors should have early repeat endoscopic examination 3 months after initial polypectomy to evaluate the polypectomy site. Total colonoscopic examination is repeated at 1 year to ensure the surveillance program is begun with a colon without neoplasms.\r"

A total of 104 patients (80.6%) had penetrating wounds, and multiple visceral and vascular injuries were usually associated with the pancreatoduodenal injury. Primary repair or resection of one or both organs coupled with pyloric exclusion and gastrojejunostomy (68 patients) and drainage was used in 79 patients (61.2%) in the entire study and in 59% (36 of 61) of all patients treated since 1976. Simple primary repair of one or both organs and drainage was performed in 31 patients (24%), whereas the remaining 19 patients (14.8%) had pancreatoduodenectomies (13 patients) or no repair before exsanguination (six patients). Major pancreatoduodenal complications occurring in the 108 patients surviving more than 48 hours included pancreatic fistulas (25.9%), intra-abdominal abscess formation (16.6%), and duodenal fistulas (6.5%). The overall mortality rate for the study was 29.5% (38 of 129). The acute mortality rate with these injuries will remain high secondary to injuries to associated organs and vascular structures. The morbidity and late mortality rates related to the moderate to severe pancreatoduodenal injury itself can be decreased by the addition of pyloric exclusion and gastrojejunostomy to the primary repairs.\r"

Bacterial translocation did not occur in control, starved (up to 72 hours), or protein-malnourished (up to 21 days) mice not receiving endotoxin. Bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) occurred in 80% of control mice 24 hours after receiving endotoxin (p less than 0.01). However, the combination of malnutrition plus endotoxin was associated with a higher incidence of translocation to the systemic organs (p less than 0.01), and higher numbers of bacteria per organ (p less than 0.01), than was seen in normally nourished mice receiving endotoxin. Additionally, mice that were protein malnourished were more susceptible to the lethal effects of endotoxin than were control animals, and the mortality rate was directly related to the degree of malnutrition (R2 = 0.93) (p less than 0.05). Histologically, endotoxin in combination with protein malnutrition resulted in mechanical damage to the gut mucosal barrier to bacteria. Thus, in the mice that were protein malnourished the spread of bacteria from the gut could not be controlled nor could translocated bacteria be cleared as well as normally nourished mice receiving endotoxin. These results support the concept that under certain circumstances the gut may serve as a clinically important portal of entry for bacteria.\r"

Traditionally, splenectomy has been used to treat hypersplenism, but may be associated with a high incidence of postsplenectomy sepsis and accelerated hepatic and bone lipid deposition. Two children are reported who had partial splenectomy for symptoms of Gaucher's disease. Both patients had laboratory evidence of hypersplenism. A 90% splenectomy was performed, and the residual splenic fragment was wrapped in Vicryl mesh. Both patients are currently asymptomatic with normal hematologic parameters. Postoperative radionuclide scans demonstrate increase in the size of the residual splenic fragment. Partial splenectomy may benefit patients with Gaucher's disease, but long-term follow-up care is necessary.\r"

There were 57 patients, age 10-72 years, with accessory pathways who had 61 operations. The perioperative mortality rate was 3.5%, with deaths occurring in two patients with complex problems. Four patients with multiple but one or more silent accessory pathways had successful reoperation, and modified surgical technique has eliminated this problem. All patients are free of arrhythmias 2-70 months after operation. The survival and primary cure rates were 100% for 36 patients with solitary accessory pathways. Eight patients, age 10-53 years, were operated on for atrial focal tachycardia. Right atrial cryothermic lesions without excision or cardiopulmonary bypass were used in four patients: local excision was used in two patients and combined procedures were used in two patients. Because of recurrence in two of four patients treated by isolated cryoablation, a new technique was applied subsequently to one of these patients and two other patients: wide atrial excision and PTFE patch replacement during cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients are free of arrhythmias at a follow-up of 9-72 months. Intractable atrial flutter or fibrillation occurred in 11 patients who had 15 attempts at transvenous A-V node electroshock ablation. In three patients in whom this failed, subsequent open cryoablation of the A-V node during cardiopulmonary bypass and epicardial pacemaker implantation were performed successfully. Two patients had A-V nodal modification for control of A-V nodal re-entry tachycardia: one patient with cryothermia at the time of ablation of atrial focal tachycardia and the other patient with sharp dissection at the time of accessory pathway division. Of the initial 67 patients, 65 (97%) survived operation and all were cured of their presenting arrhythmia. Surgery for drug-refractory supraventricular arrhythmias is safe and effective in selected cases.\r"

All patients had cardiac catheterization with calculation of right ventricular volume. Group A patients (N = 8) had a small right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV less than 72% of predicted). Group B patients (N = 10) had a normal or enlarged RVEDV. All patients had a closed pulmonary valvotomy. Five Group A patients required a systemic-pulmonary shunt or prostaglandin (PGE1) after operation; one patient died. Nine Group B patients did well after valvotomy; one moribund patient died after valvotomy and shunt. Six of 16 survivors required reoperation: valvectomy in four patients and shunt takedown in two patients. Four of the six patients who had reoperation also had a transannular patch. There was one unrelated late death. All long-term survivors are asymptomatic. Recatheterization in four patients with a small right ventricle (RV) documented significant RV growth. In conclusion, most neonates with critical PS can be managed with closed valvotomy. Patients with a small RV may require PGE1 or a shunt after operation for persistent hypoxemia. Some patients with a small RV will have significant RV growth after valvotomy.\r"

Dissatisfied with this approach because of the high incidence of local complications, mortality, and loss of limb, 20 patients with secondary aortoduodenal fistula had duodenal repair, excision of the old graft, and placement of a new graft in the same location. A similar technique was used in three patients with erosion of an aortic graft into the jejunum. Length of follow-up averaged 5.2 years, and was more than 1 year in each instance. Of the eighteen patients who survived the repair, three have had early recurrent rupture or false aneurysm of the proximal aortic anastomosis, with consequent death in two, but fifteen patients (83%) have had no further related problem. There was no loss of limb. Use of greater omentum as a protective barrier seemed helpful. Optimal antibiotic usage, and the idea that varying degrees of graft infection require different approaches, require further definition. In conclusion, in situ graft replacement is the correct operative strategy in this challenging group of patients.\r"

Coexisting disease conditions of the aorta sometimes make alternative methods of renal revascularization preferable, especially when more than one renal artery is involved. Such alternative procedures include transaortic endarterectomy, bilateral renal endarterectomy via a transverse incision across both renal arteries, or extra-anatomic bypass from the splenic, hepatic, or iliac arteries. Two hundred twenty-five renal revascularization procedures performed either alone or in combination with other abdominal vascular procedures during the last 5 years is reported. In 18 patients, one of the above procedures was performed. This experience with these various types of renal revascularization will be discussed with particular reference to indications, technique, and potential pitfalls of each procedure.\r"

The nonreversed vein graft also appears to offer advantages over the reversed graft with regard to the size of the proximal and distal anastomoses when used as an aortorenal or iliorenal graft as well as in other anatomic locations. Over the past 30 months these techniques were used to implant 10 vein grafts at diverse sites in nine patients with initial success in all instances and one late graft failure.\r"

There was 1 early death (6%), but no operative deaths have occurred since 1977. There was 1 late death from unknown cause 51 months postoperatively. One patient has been lost to follow-up. Long-term follow-up of 14 patients was 923 months (mean, 66 months; range, 9 to 120 months). Of the 16 patients, 12 (75%) had had previous cardiovascular procedures. A total of thirty-five operations, including the aortoventriculoplasties, were done in the 16 patients. Of the aortic valves inserted, 11 were tissue valves (Carpentier-Edwards, 10; Ionescu-Shiley, 1) and 5 were mechanical valves (St. Jude, 3; Bjork-Shiley, 2). Patient age at the time of aortoventriculoplasty ranged from 2 years 3 months to 24 years (median, 11 years 8 months). Size of the aortic annulus ranged from 10 to less than 21 mm (median, 16 mm). Valves inserted ranged from 21 to 29 mm; 13 (81%) of them were 25 mm or larger. In 2 patients, degenerated tissue valves were replaced with mechanical valves after 110 and 33 months. At present, all patients are in New York Heart Association Functional Class I. One female patient married and delivered a normal child approximately five years after AVR with a Carpentier-Edwards valve plus aortoventriculoplasty; she never received anticoagulant medications. We conclude that AVR with a concomitant Konno aortoventriculoplasty can be safely performed in the pediatric and young-adult age groups with satisfactory results for up to ten years.\r"

Up to twenty percent of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome harbor multiple atrioventricular accessory pathways. In this subgroup, classic operative techniques, especially the methods of approach, must be combined or modified depending on the specific locations of the accessory pathways encountered. Eighteen of 90 patients operated on for WPW syndrome at Charlotte Memorial Hospital from August, 1983, through September, 1986, had multiple accessory pathways. Thirty-eight of thirty-nine pathways were successfully divided. One posterior septal accessory pathway reappeared 2 months postoperatively and was catheter ablated. The most frequent combination of atrioventricular accessory pathways included a right free wall and a posterior septal accessory pathway (10 patients). This combination is approached by a right atriotomy. The posterior septal space dissection is extended onto the right free wall area. Technically the most difficult combination includes a left free wall and a posterior septal accessory pathway (3 patients in the present series). Our preferred approach is begun with a right atriotomy for the posterior septal space dissection, followed by an atrial septotomy to expose the left free wall area. There are other methods, however, that may be advantageous depending on the exact locations of the accessory pathways encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary vascular impedance is a measure of the pulsatile characteristic of pressure and flow that occurs in the proximal pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is most influenced by the distal circulation of the lung. This study was performed to evaluate the changes that occurred in pulmonary vascular impedance, as well as in other hemodynamic variables, following pneumonectomy by a closed-chest method in 10 anesthetized dogs. The following observations were made (numbers compare mean values for the 10 dogs before and after pneumonectomy): (1) PVR increased from 447 to 761 dyne sec cm-5 (p = .02); (2) the oscillatory work of the right ventricle increased from 1.23 to 1.76 J/min (p = .006); (3) the mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 14 to 18.8 mm Hg (p = .0001); and (4) cardiac output and heart rate remained unchanged. Surprisingly, the estimated characteristic impedance (the impedance to oscillatory flow in the proximal bed) did not change significantly (279 to 296 dyne sec cm-5). This observation cannot be explained by the usual lumped compartmental models classically used to characterize the pulmonary vascular bed.\r"

The cause of the aneurysm was atherosclerosis in 52% and dissection in 41%. Fifty-eight percent of the patients had an aneurysm of the entire descending thoracic aorta and 14 of these patients had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. Emergency operation was performed in 16 patients (17%). There were 14 early deaths (14.7%) within one month after operation. Postoperative complications included renal dysfunction, partial paraplegia, and hemorrhage. Renal dysfunction occurred in 7 (7.8%) of the operative survivors; 2 of the 7 required hemodialysis. Partial paraplegia was observed in 2 patients undergoing total replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Neither renal dysfunction nor paraplegia was related to the duration of aortic cross-clamping. Postoperative hemorrhage necessitating reopening of the chest occurred in 8 (8.9%) of the operative survivors. Partial CPB is useful in reducing the incidence of postoperative complications among patients undergoing aortic cross-clamping for a long period.\r"

Hospital mortality was 0.4% and the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, 1.8%. At follow-up (mean, 30.5 months), 11 patients had sustained an interval nonfatal myocardial infarction, 3 had had percutaneous angioplasty, and 2 had undergone reoperative revascularization. Actuarial survival at five years was 91.6 +/- 2.0%. Actuarial event-free rates at five years were 97.7 +/- 0.8% for myocardial infarction, 99.4 +/- 0.4% for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, 99.5 +/- 0.4% for reoperative revascularization, and 88.6 +/- 2.2% for all combined morbidity and mortality. Among the 122 patients meeting randomizable admission criteria of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study, there were no operative deaths and no perioperative infarctions, and the actuarial survival was 97.5% at five years. Hypothermic fibrillatory arrest is effective for myocardial preservation during coronary revascularization and when combined with complete revascularization, yields excellent event-free survival.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemic spinal cord injury with resulting postoperative paraplegia is an inherent risk for operations on the thoracic aorta. The mechanism of injury is not clearly understood, and numerous adjuncts to avoid this complication have been suggested, with conflicting clinical results. A new technique of hypothermic regional perfusion of the spinal cord is described. Fifteen female pigs weighing 21 to 39 kg were used for the experiment. The control group consisted of 5 animals in which the thoracic aorta was clamped at the distal arch for 30 minutes. All of these animals sustained postoperative neurological damage. Eighty percent sustained postoperative paraplegia, and 20% had severe spasticity of the hind legs that precluded normal ambulation. The experimental group consisted of 10 animals in which hypothermic regional perfusion was performed for 30 minutes after cross-clamping of the distal arch. Perfusion cooling was followed by 30 minutes of ischemia in 5 animals and 45 minutes of ischemia in the remaining 5. All animals that underwent hypothermic regional perfusion were able to walk postoperatively, and no evidence of ischemic injury was found at postmortem examination of the spinal cords. This technique proved to be simple and effective in protecting the spinal cord for up to 45 minutes of ischemia in the experimental group. The clinical implications of this concept are promising for patients undergoing operations on the thoracic aorta.\r"

One patient had a mycotic aneurysm of the arch, and 2 patients had arteriosclerotic aneurysms of the ascending aorta and entire aortic arch. All patients were supported and cooled with cardiopulmonary bypass. Circulatory arrest was maintained for periods of 21 to 63 minutes. All 10 patients survived the operative procedure. Nine patients remained intact neurologically. Renal function returned to baseline in all patients. Average blood replacement was 2.9 units. All patients have experienced an excellent surgical result. The average follow-up is 21.1 months. The technique facilitates a surgical approach to these lesions and appears to be the safest form of vital-organ preservation.\r"

The advisability of using a portion of old graft when reconstructing these grafts was examined. An experimental model was devised in which the anatomical and pathological interfaces between fresh vein and previously inserted vein were studied. Superficial femoral artery from the thigh of 15 dogs was replaced by reversed autogenous saphenous vein. Four months later, the animals were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 8 animals that underwent transection and reimplantation of the middle 4 cm of the vein graft in exactly the same position in which it had been. In Group 2, the 7 animals had the middle 4 cm of the graft replaced with newly harvested reversed saphenous vein. Six months after initial vein graft implantation, the animals were studied. No critical stenoses were seen in the grafts. Pathological study of Group 1 grafts revealed fibrous graft disease of uniform severity throughout the graft, thereby demonstrating that new anastomoses in an old graft do not affect graft disease. Group 2 grafts revealed that the severity of disease in the new interposed segment of the vein graft was less than in the old retained portions of the graft. No untoward reaction causing acceleration of graft disease occurred between old and new vein. Operations using undiseased portions of old vein grafts should be considered a viable option in repeat coronary revascularization for early stenoses.\r"

We studied the effects of the financial unbundling of clinical biochemistry determinations in a university outpatient clinic. After eliminating the charge structure that promoted panel use, the ordering of chemistry 19 panels fell dramatically, accompanied by an increase in orders for electrolyte and chemistry 6 panels. The total number of biochemical assay determinations fell by one third after this administrative intervention. Only orders for potassium and creatinine measurements remained relatively unchanged and eventually increased. The ordering of five analytes of the chemistry 19 profile was reduced by at least 50%. Reassessment of the intervention six months later demonstrated the sustained decline in laboratory use. We conclude that physicians are attuned to price inefficiencies in basic laboratory testing and can alter their ordering behavior accordingly. Facilities can change patterns of use by altering charge structures alone. The decline in laboratory testing also indicates that physicians receive unnecessary clinical data when they order biochemical profiles. Financially bundled chemistry profiles could be replaced by physiologically based test groupings.\r"

Standardized patients are non-physicians highly trained to function in the multiple roles of patient, teacher, and evaluator while realistically replicating a patient encounter. They are effective teachers of interviewing and physical examination skills. They can help to provide a controlled exposure to common ambulatory and difficult patient communication situations. Initial studies indicate the promise of this approach for ensuring the competence of medical school graduates.\r"

They were divided into five groups based on the following clinical, biologic, and histologic criteria: alcoholic cirrhosis (89 patients), noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease (55 patients), chronic alcoholism without liver disease (46 patients), nonalcoholic chronic liver disease (68 patients), and a control group (174 patients). The prevalence of DC in these five groups of patients was 32.5%, 22%, 28%, 6%, and 12%, respectively; the prevalence of DC was higher in patients with cirrhotic or noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease (25.5%) than it was in patients with nonalcoholic liver disease (6%), but it was not significantly different in alcoholic patients with or without liver disease. The relationship between DC and age, sex, manual labor, previous hand injuries, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking was assessed by univariate and logistic regression methods. Nine variables were significantly different in patients with or without DC: age, sex, manual labor, previous hand injuries, diabetes mellitus, daily alcohol consumption, duration of alcohol consumption, total alcohol consumption, and duration of cigarette smoking. In our patients, variables that could explain DC were, in decreasing order, age, total alcohol consumption, sex (male), and previous hand injuries. In alcoholic patients, these variables were age and previous hand injuries; in nonalcoholic patients, these variables were age and cigarette smoking. These results emphasize the high prevalence of DC in alcoholic patients and the absence of a correlation between DC and chronic liver disease. Age and alcohol consumption are the best explanatory variables of DC in hospitalized patients.\r"

This prevalence is 10.9 times the rate for all whites of Arizona and New Mexico and 3.6 times the rate for all Indians of Arizona and New Mexico. The Zuni incidence is 8.6 times the incidence for Arizona and New Mexico. The most frequent causes were chronic glomerulonephritis (40%) and diabetic nephropathy (24%). In 21% of the cases no cause could be assigned. The cause for these high rates of end-stage renal disease is unknown. Hypotheses with preliminary clinical findings are presented. Further comprehensive study is recommended.\r"

Of these, 1010 patients who were believed to be free of active disease other than cholelithiasis were selected for further study. Preoperative screening investigations were assessed in terms of frequency of use and abnormalities detected. The predictive values of these tests were analyzed and compared with information obtained from the history and physical examination. The frequency with which action was taken because of abnormal test results was also determined. Of the 5003 preoperative screening tests performed, abnormal results were obtained in 225. Of these, 104 were of potential importance. Action resulting from these abnormalities occurred in 17 cases. In only four patients could a conceivable benefit have arisen from a preoperative screening test. When compared with the results of the history and physical examination, routine preoperative investigations provided little further information that altered management in otherwise healthy surgical patients undergoing cholecystectomy.\r"

The two patient characteristics associated with a drug-related admission (DRA) were marital status (divorced) and age (older patients). The two most common types of DRAs were adverse drug reactions (17/45, 37.8%) and drug abuse (14/45, 31.1%), with alcohol being the most commonly abused agent. Adverse drug reactions were most commonly implicated in DRAs for patients over 70 years old, with drug abuse more evenly distributed among age groups. Educational programs that incorporate pharmacoepidemiologic strategies into all health care disciplines are necessary to address this public health issue.\r"

In one of the patients, liver metastases of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid were already present in biopsy specimens taken 22 years earlier. In two patients bilateral pheochromocytomas were completely removed. These observations show that, in contrast to the general view, the clinical course of MEN 2b can be as indolent as that of MEN 2a or sporadic forms of the tumors involved, despite the presence of metastases. This may indicate that factors other than the type of inheritance contribute to the outcome of the disease.\r"

Comparing cytology with pleural core needle biopsy specimens in 26 patients, the cytology results were positive in 96%, while the needle biopsy specimens alone were positive in only 69%. Following the diagnoses of malignant pleural effusions, the patients receiving combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy had a mean survival of 328 days, compared with only 79 days for those who received no therapy. In conclusion, cytologic examination of Papanicolaou-stained smears yielded a greater percentage of positive diagnoses than either cell block preparations or pleural needle biopsy specimens. Over the past 25 years, the mean survival after the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions has shown no improvement.\r"

The initial diagnosis was made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in three patients and by bone marrow and liver biopsy specimens in one patient each. All patients had fungemia, septic shock, and multiple organ involvement. Three patients had a fulminant course and died within four weeks. Two patients had more prolonged courses, with one survival period of ten months.

This investigation involved the administration of the Beck Depression Inventory, the Clinical Depression Measure, the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, and the Activity Pattern Indicators. The first issue of interest was the incidence of clinical depression in this community-based sample. Evidence of clinical depression was found in only 15% of the sample, with 45% of respondents showing evidence of mild depression. A second issue concerned the independent and/or interactive effects of depression and injury levels across several different types of ADL. Independent depression effects were found for personal activities, such that mildly depressed respondents reported fewer personal activities than nondepressed individuals. Independent injury level effects were found for overall frequency of activities, with quadriplegics achieving lower scores than paraplegics. Interactive effects were obtained between depression and injury level for work and travel. For each of these activities, similar levels were found for nondepressed quadriplegic, mildly depressed quadriplegic, and mildly depressed paraplegic respondents, all of whom were less active than nondepressed paraplegics. These results suggest that for some activities depression may play as important a role in long-term rehabilitation as degree of disability.\r"

Although several of the Vignos and Brooke categories did not describe significant numbers of these patients, the Vignos scale was able to predict whether or not a given patient would use a wheelchair with 94% accuracy, while the Brooke scale was only 85% accurate. It was not possible to predict manual vs electric wheelchair use based on functional rating scores. Patients with proximal weakness, regardless of diagnosis, displayed a similar pattern of functional outcome and equipment use, which was significantly different from the pattern displayed by groups with distal weakness. As expected, as functional ability diminished, wheelchair use increased; however, wheelchair use began at surprisingly high functional levels. Patients generally preferred a combination of manual and electric wheelchair use.\r"

Their outcomes were compared with those of 196 patients who required mechanical respiration some time during acute care or rehabilitation, but who were free of such assistance at discharge. Statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups in levels of spinal cord injury, duration of acute care hospitalization, duration of total hospitalization, extent of self-care capability, hours/week of hired attendant care, and hours of actual physical assistance/day. The groups did not differ significantly in terms of duration of inpatient rehabilitation, duration of rehospitalization, and vocational or prevocational status at follow-up.\r"

Subjects reported 24-hour sequences of activities using the Self-Observation and Report Technique (SORT). Demographic and injury-related data were also obtained. During the third month after discharge, participants reported on daily behavior and health status. Results of multiple regression analyses showed that (1) independent behavior (activities without help) in the ward predicted postdischarge independence: (2) number and diversity of activities predicted number of activities after discharge; (3) a combination of four demographic variables predicted number of different locations entered; and (4) three behavioral measures accounted for effects of health problems on daily activities. By predicting which hospitalized clients are likely to have difficulty in some important aspects of their adjustment after discharge, treatment teams may develop strategies for coping with the anticipated difficulties.\r"

  ".W": "There is a striking absence of data on the cardiovascular fitness of mentally retarded adults and what limited data are reported reflect field or submaximal laboratory tests. This study sought to develop a protocol that would allow maximal aerobic testing (VO2max) of mentally retarded adults in the laboratory. Of 21 subjects recruited, 17 (eight men and nine women) were successfully tested. Their mean IQ (+/- SD) was 52.68 +/- 16.3; their weight was 149.76 +/- 35.3 lbs, height 64.4 +/- 4.2 in, and age 29.29 +/- 6.6 yr. The testing occurred in three phases: (1) familiarization with the laboratory environs; (2) training to walk on the treadmill and breathe through the respiratory collection system; and (3) data collection via graded exercise testing. The treadmill protocol consisted of walking at 3 mph at 0% grade for two minutes, followed by 3 mph at a 2.5% grade for two minutes. The speed was then held constant at 3 mph and the grade increased 2.5% every minute until exhaustion. Metabolic data were collected every minute using a Beckman MCC cart connected to the subjects through a Hans-Rudolph valve. Heart rates (HR) were collected with a Quinton electrocardiograph. The mean maximal cardiorespiratory data were as follows (+/- SD):VO2max = 26.3 +/- 8.0 ml X kg-1 X min-1; HRmax = 171 +/- 14 beats/min; VEmax = 62.8 +/- 21.8 L/min; and respiratory quotient (R) = 1.09 +/- .07. The R values obtained were within an acceptable range for valid maximal data. In addition, 15 subjects produced supramaximal work and showed a decline in VO2 during the last minute of exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Stimulation sites were over the dorsum of the foot at the distal fifth metatarsal for the S1 dermatome and at the web space of the first and second toe for the L5 dermatome. Recordings were made at PZ reference to FZ. Spinal cord or cauda responses could not be detected. Both EMG and DSEP were contrasted to myelography or lumbar computerized tomography results on 31 patients. Side-to-side amplitude differences proved too variable to be of use. Sixty-five percent of abnormal DSEP results were on the basis of side-to-side latency criterion, and 35% were on the basis of an absent unilateral response. When compared to EMG and anatomic studies DSEP showed less accuracy and sensitivity. The specificity of the two tests was similar. Using both positive EMG and anatomic studies to define radiculopathy, there were 27% false negative tests and 9% false positive tests. An 86% root level correlation was found between EMG and DSEP. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential studies add little to the diagnosis of radiculopathy.\r"

Epidemiologists have reported that age greater than 75 is a negative factor in rehabilitation. In two studies, less than 10% of persons aged 90 and over regained ambulatory or prefracture status. This retrospective study describes the outcomes of rehabilitation of persons 90 years and older with fracture of the proximal femur. During a one-year period, 18 persons (17 women, one man), range 91 to 102 years (means 93 years), were referred from ten hospitals for rehabilitation after hip fracture. Eight physical therapists were involved at six different skilled nursing facilities covering a geographical area of 2300 square miles. The sample was determined to represent the regional population. Upon final physical therapy treatment all 16 surviving patients needed an assistive device for ambulation; 63% of the subjects attained independent ambulation; the average ambulatory distance was 133 ft; and 44% returned home. At one-year follow-up, 12/16 original patients survived, nine remaining patients were independent in ambulation, of whom five were at home. Under the prospective payment system with diagnosis-related groups, peculiar decisions are made that have an impact upon rehabilitation. Recovery of independent ambulation is an excellent index of rehabilitation outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three children (10 to 15 years of age) with myelomeningocele were studied to determine isometric muscle strength of hip and knee extension, range of hip and knee extension, usual and maximal ambulatory velocities, maximal aerobic capacity, and the energy cost (oxygen uptake) of ambulation versus wheelchair usage in subjects who both walked and wheeled. Subjects were placed into one of four groups depending on their level of motor function (those with motor levels at L2 and above, L3-4, L5 to sacral, and without motor deficit). Maximal ambulatory velocity correlated with strength of the hip extensor (r = 0.85) and knee extensor (r = 0.81) muscles. All variables were found highly dependent upon the level of motor function. Subjects with the greatest deficits had the most significant impairments and vice versa. It was found, however, that subjects without motor deficit had impairments in the usual speed of ambulation (9%), maximal running velocity (20%), and VO2 max (13%). These deficits were due to the measured strength deficits in these subjects as compared to normal values. This finding underscores the importance of quantitative assessment of muscle strength as significant deficits in strength can be missed with manual muscle testing. In those subjects who walked and wheeled, wheeling was found much more energy efficient. Wheeling at 4.8 km/hr was 11% more efficient than walking at 33% that velocity.\r"

Factors studied included side of hemiplegia, laterality of disability, level of amputation, order of disability (amputation first or hemiplegia first), neuromuscular status, mental status, sex, age. The level of function was defined as independent, limited, or nonambulatory. Of 52 double-disability patients, thirty were fitted with a prosthesis. Eight patients attained independent prosthetic function while 16 patients were limited and six were nonambulatory. Factors such as ipsilateral BK amputation preceding hemiplegia, a good-to-fair neuromuscular status, and an intact mental status have been associated with better functional results. Although producing higher fitting rates, none of these factors has been found in the present study to be associated with statistically higher levels of ambulatory function. A good-to-fair neuromuscular status seemed to be the prime requisite for good ambulation with a prosthesis in a patient with the double disability of amputation and hemiplegia.\r"

This report includes a description of the orthosis and an analysis of its use in achondroplastic children and adults. Nineteen dwarfs between 11 and 52 months of age were fitted with a light truncal polyform orthosis. The effect on the thoracolumbar (TL) and lumbosacral curves (LS) in the seated and standing child were compared by measurements made from lateral roentgenograms with and without the orthosis. The group mean reduction in TL curve of the seated dwarfs was 23 degrees (range 2 degrees to 73 degrees) and the reduction in the LS curve in the standing position was 15 degrees (range 1 degree to 44 degrees). Seventeen older children aged 4-1/2 to 11-2/3 years were equipped with an aluminum version of the orthosis. Their TL curve sitting was reduced by a mean of 31 degrees (range 6 degrees to 45 degrees) and their LS curve standing was decreased by 16 degrees (range 6 degrees to 30 degrees). Thirty-one achondroplastic children and adults were braced for back pain and/or neurologic deficits. Most were relieved of their symptoms to some degree. These and other data lead us to conclude that this form of treatment reduces deformity and alleviates symptoms.\r"

Although preoperative TAE resulted in significantly increased tumor necrosis, it increased the risk of gangrenous change of the gallbladder, induced adhesion of the hepatoduodenal ligament, and was not effective in reducing operative blood loss or operative time if the vessel selected for TAE was inadequate. Pathologic examination revealed tumor emboli still existing in the intrahepatic veins. Daughter nodules and capsular invasion by tumor cells were not affected by TAE.

Plasma free fatty acids and blood lactate concentrations were unchanged by either the operation or BCAA administration. Serum glucose concentration was unaffected by the different amino acid administrations and followed the pattern induced by stress initially and later by starvation. beta-Hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased as starvation proceeded and were highest in patients receiving the 15.6% BCAA solution. Branched-chain amino acid-enriched solutions without additional energy may be administered safely to patients recovering from operative trauma.

Acutely, reinforcing a single staple line with a second or third application of the stapler resulted in an anastomosis more resistant to leakage and disruption. Satisfactory healing occurred by 21 days and contributed to staple line strength in the pouches using a single and double application of the stapler. The orientation of collagen deposition in the anastomosis was related to the number of staples used. The degree of collagen deposition across the muscularis mucosa correlated with the healed staple line strength. Although healing occurred when a triple application of the stapler was utilized, the orientation of the fibroconnective tissue was parallel to the anastomosis and did not contribute to staple line integrity.\r"

Six dogs received 1 L of lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and six others received 1 L of 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution (D5LR). Three sham-operated dogs received 1 L of D5LR and underwent right nephrectomy but no occlusions. All dogs received 500 mL of fluid before occlusion and 500 mL after occlusion. The blood glucose concentration for the LR group was 7.6 mmol/L (137 mg/dL) after 500 mL and 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) after 1000 mL. In the D5LR group, the blood glucose concentration was 21.5 mmol/L (387 mg/dL) after 500 mL and 20.2 mmol/L (363 mg/dL) after 1000 mL. In the sham-operated group, the blood glucose concentration was 22.8 mmol/L (410 mg/dL) after 500 mL and 20.7 mmol/L (373 mg/dL) after 1000 mL. At 30 hours, the plasma creatinine concentration rose from 70 to 300 mumol/L (0.8 to 3.4 mg/dL) in the LR group and from 90 to 500 mumol/L (1.0 to 5.8 mg/dL) in the D5LR group; the increase for the D5LR group was significantly greater than that for the LR group. In the sham-operated group, the plasma creatinine concentration was stable throughout the 30-hour period. This study demonstrates a significant detrimental effect of dextrose administration on renal function during normothermic ischemia.\r"

Using life-table analysis, the annual stroke rate was estimated to be 1% and 2.2% considering the previously asymptomatic and symptomatic ICA, respectively. Separating patients according to the degree of stenosis on the preoperative angiogram and according to the presence of ulceration revealed a significantly higher incidence of neurologic events and strokes in patients with stenoses exceeding 50% and/or patients with obvious ulcerations. Although the risk of stroke without warning was increased in these subgroups, we did not consider the risk high enough to warrant prophylactic endarterectomy. An exception enough to warrant prophylactic endarterectomy. An exception may be the patient with a more than 90% stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Three methods of excising nonpalpable breast lesions have been evaluated: (1) \"blind\" method, using mammographic coordinates; (2) preoperative localization with the Frank needle; and (3) Frank needle localization aided by a multiperforated compression plate. Successful removal at first attempt occurred in about 80% with any method. The size of the biopsy specimens did not differ significantly among the three groups and is most probably a function of the breast volume. The failure rate was seven (2.1%) of 332 biopsies. Since three of the six repeated biopsies yielded specimens with malignancy, the persistence of a radiographically suspicious lesion on follow-up mammogram of the operated-on breast is an urgent indication for reoperation.\r"

In 242 cases general anesthesia was used. The other 157 cases were done under regional cervical block anesthesia. Perioperative mortality was 1.0%. Nonfatal strokes occurred in 1.25%. There were significantly more strokes in the general anesthesia group. Perioperative blood pressure was unstable for a significantly longer period of time after general anesthesia (mean, 24.6 hours) as compared with regional cervical block anesthesia (mean, 2.1 hours). Furthermore, vasoactive drugs were required for significantly longer periods of time in the general anesthesia group.\r"

Mitochondrial coupling, expressed as respiratory control index, was preserved at up to 60 minutes' cold ischemia. However, respiratory control index was decreased significantly from control by 30 minutes of warm ischemia. Both microsomal magnesium-activated ATPase and sodium-potassium ATPase activity were significantly increased by 60 minutes of warm ischemia yet were unaltered by 60 minutes of ischemia at 0 degree C to 4 degrees C. Warm ischemia produces deleterious effects on energy-generating (mitochondria) and energy-utilizing (ATPase) activity. Hypothermia provides a significant prolongation of cellular viability in ischemic tissue in terms of bioenergetic status. In addition to organ procurement and transplantation, hypothermic cytoprotection may prove valuable in areas such as shock, ischemia, and other clinical conditions of compromised visceral perfusion.\r"

A patient with enterococcal endocarditis sustained separate intra-abdominal hemorrhages, 24 hours apart, from aneurysms of the middle colic and left colic arteries. Sterile vessel cultures with inflammatory infiltrates, decreased complement levels, positive rheumatoid factor, and arteriographic evidence of multiple visceral aneurysms suggest the vasculitis was immunologically mediated and not mycotic. Antibiotic therapy after control of hemorrhage controlled abdominal symptoms.\r"

Surgical intervention was delayed in all five patients either because the diagnosis was missed by the physician or because the patient failed to seek medical attention. Physicians should be alerted to the possibility of acute gastric dilatation if a young woman, who may be undernourished and anorexic, complains of abdominal pain after ingestion of a large meal. Often this condition can be treated conservatively before irreversible damage to the gastric wall has taken place. If the gastric dilatation progresses, the stomach loses its contractility, resulting in venous occlusion, infarction, and gastric perforation. An extensive operation is required, and the patient undergoes an often complicated and prolonged hospital course.\r"

In contrast to patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, of whom 15% to 26% are classified as having multiple endocrine neoplasias type I (MEN I), only 3% to 4% of patients with insulinomas have other endocrine neoplasms. Insulinomas in patients with MEN I are usually single tumors that usually can be cured with enucleation of the tumor. In contradistinction, gastrinomas in patients with MEN I are diffuse in nature and resection only rarely can be accomplished. Long-term management of gastric hypersecretion is best accomplished by H2-receptor antagonists. If the patient does not respond to H2-receptor antagonists or is unwilling to take the drug indefinitely, he or she will be a candidate for total gastrectomy.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated a reconstruction procedure of the upper gastrointestinal tract after total gastrectomy with the exclusive use of the EEA, GIA, and TA surgical stapling devices (United States Surgical Corp, Norwalk, Conn). Twenty patients with gastric carcinoma entered the study. A total gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy was performed in each patient and the upper gastrointestinal tract was reconstructed by the Roux-en-Y technique with the creation of a Hunt-Lawrence-Rodino pouch. For all operational steps, surgical staplers were used exclusively, as follows: (1) duodenal closure, GIA or TA; (2) Roux-en-Y anastomosis, EEA 25; (3) pouch construction, GIA (three to four times); (4) esophagojejunostomy, EEA 25; and (5) pouch closure, TA 55 or 90. There was a one-hour difference in operating time between patients operated on exclusively by the staple technique and TNM-matched patients operated on manually. Four patients suffered from general complications. Two patients had clinically relevant suture deficiencies. We concluded that current reconstruction methods after gastrectomy that fulfill the reservoir function (pouch) and reflux prevention (Roux-en-Y reconstruction) can be achieved by the combination and systematic use of straight and circular staplers. The advantages are intraoperative time saving and a relaxation of limitations imposed on an abdominal intervention by age and localization of the tumor.\r"
