The pressure algometer offered easy control of pressure application rate. The intra-individual coefficient of variation, based on repeated PPT measurements with a 1 week interval was 14%. The inter-individual coefficient of variation was 28% for females and 33% for males. In the course of 10 consecutive PPT measurements with short intervals (10 and 20 sec), no significant change in PPT was observed. PPT was found to be 50% higher in males than in females (P less than 0.0001). Slightly but significantly higher PPT values were found on the dominant compared to the non-dominant side (P less than 0.005).\r"

  ".W": "The semantic structure and the underlying dimensions of 176 common Dutch words used to describe various kinds of pain were studied. Seventy-seven subjects rated the intensity of the pain described by each of these words; another 53 subjects sorted the words with regard to their similarity in meaning. A unidimensional solution adequately represented the intensity ratings. The sorting data were analyzed by means of HOMALS, a program for multiple correspondence analysis, which yielded a 3-dimensional configuration differentiating evaluative/affective, sensory, temporal and spatial aspects of pain. Regression analysis showed intensity to be the main criterion for similarity within the affective/evaluative group, whereas intensity was not related to the similarities among the sensory words. Cluster analysis, using the distances in the 3-dimensional HOMALS space, yielded 32 clusters of words among which the subscales of both the original McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and the Dutch version by Vanderiet et al. could easily be identified. Since the present results were obtained in a different country and by completely different methods of data collection (i.e., similarity sortings without a priori categories), they strongly indicate the cross-cultural and cross-methodological generality of the structure of pain descriptions.\r"

  ".W": "From July 1986 to July 1988, 146 children less than 5 years of age were referred by their physicians to our university sleep clinic for continual waking and crying during sleep hours. For 85 children (58.2%), the sleeplessness was attributed to inappropriate sleep habits. For 17 children (11.6%), no explanation was found for the sleep difficulties in spite of an extensive workup. Their median age at referral was 13.5 months (range 2.5 to 29 months). Their persistent sleeplessness was tentatively attributed to an undiagnosed intolerance to cow's milk. Cow's milk was excluded from their diet. In 15 children sleep normalized after 5 weeks (range 4 to 6 weeks). As seen from the parents' logs, the median time needed by the children to fall asleep decreased from 15 minutes (range 15 to 60 minutes) to 10 minutes (range 10 to 15 minutes, P = .001). The number of complete arousals decreased from 5 (range 1 to 12) to less than 1 per night (range 0 to 2) (P = .001). Total sleep time per 24 hours increased from 5.5 hours (range 3 to 8.5 hours) to 13.0 hours (range 10 to 14.5 hours, P = .001). Sleep normalized in one child who continued to receive no cow's milk only after the hydrolyzed hypoallergenic diet was discontinued. In every child, a double-blind crossover challenge was conducted involving a control diet containing no cow's milk and a diet containing cow's milk. The challenge induced the reappearance of insomnia and agitated behavior in all except one child. The child's initial sleep difficulties were retrospectively attributed to inappropriate sleep habits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A longitudinal analysis revealed that covariate adjusted growth rates in stature were negatively related to the infants' postnatal blood lead concentration, as indexed by increase in average blood lead values from 3 to 15 months. However, this relationship between growth rate and change in blood lead concentration was evidenced only among those infants whose mothers had prenatal blood lead levels greater than the maternal cohort median of 7.7 micrograms/dL is about 2 cm shorter at 15 months of age if, postnatally, the infant incurred a 10-micrograms/dL blood lead increase during the 3- to 15-month interval of life, compared with an infant who has no increase.\r"

Pregnancy outcome risk categories based on combinations of these variables and a measure of body proportions were developed and tested with respect to how well they predict poor growth during infancy. Data were collected during a prospective community-based survey of births representative of the Cebu region of the Philippines. In the sample of 2139 births for which there were available birth weight and gestational age data, 20% of infants were classified as growth retarded and 12% were low birth weight. Low birth weight, the more conservative category, was a better predictor of small infant size at 12 months of age than intrauterine growth retardation. Rohrer's index, which captures information about patterns of intrauterine growth, improves the positive predictive value of categories based either on intrauterine growth retardation or low birth weight. Infants who had an adequate Rohrer's index, ie, were well proportioned at birth, were smaller at 12 months of age than infants who had a low Rohrer's index, ie, had weight deficits relative to their lengths at birth. Important questions about the value of the intrauterine growth retardation classification are raised by the results.\r"

Group I was drawn from a children's hospital adolescent clinic and group II was drawn from a public health clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. None of the 240 adolescents in group I had a pharyngeal culture positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae compared with 3.4% in group II. Only 2.5% of group I had genital gonorrhea, but 33% of group II had positive genital cultures. In only two of the 20 patients with pharyngeal gonococcal infection was the pharynx the only infected site. The addition of routine pharyngeal culturing for gonorrhea yielded only 1% additional gonorrhea cases. There was a significant relationship between concurrent genital and pharyngeal gonorrhea. These findings indicate that routine screening for pharyngeal gonorrhea is not productive in some adolescent populations. A more economic approach would be to use gonorrhea treatment that is effective against both genital and pharyngeal gonorrhea or to obtain pharyngeal cultures in those adolescents returning for test-of-cure cultures after antibiotic treatment for genital gonorrhea.\r"

There was not a large difference between total breast-feeding intention (77.7%) and total breast-feeding practice (63.8%). However, the 67.7% intention of exclusive breast-feeding drastically decreased to 19.7% and 17.2% in the hospital and at home, respectively. Formula supplementation, increased by 4.5 times from intention to practice. Exclusive formula feeding increased from 10.0% to approximately 37.0% in the hospital and at home. Stepwise logistic regression identified that the likelihood of intending breast-feeding was greater for mothers who migrated from Mexico than for mothers born in the United States (odds ratio 4.75). The likelihood of breast-feeding practice was greater for mothers who initiated breast-feeding within the first 10 hours after birth as opposed to 11 or more hours (odds ratio 1.27), for mothers who had a vaginal rather than cesarean delivery (odds ratio 12.76), for mothers who did not return to work postpartum as opposed to working mothers (odds ratio 28.26), and for mothers who migrated from Mexico compared with mothers born in the United States (odds ratio 8.54). The importance of assessing and supporting mothers' breast-feeding intentions in the pre- and post-partum period is documented. Training in the clinical aspects of breast-feeding and improvement of hospital protocols is recommended. Mothers intending to breast-feed should be identified and supported.\r"

  ".W": "In adult populations, elevated blood pressure is related to the development of occlusive atherosclerosis, stroke, and renal disease. The significance of blood pressure levels in childhood, unless extremely elevated, has not been related to disease outcomes. In this study, the risk of high blood pressure in young adult life is evaluated based on the observations of blood pressure and other factors made during the school-aged years. Subjects, 2445 in number, were first observed at ages 7 through 18 years and again between 20 and 30 years. During childhood, measurements of blood pressure, height, and weight were made in alternate years. At adult ages, the same measurements were again made and a health questionnaire was administered. According to the data, adult blood pressure is correlated with childhood blood pressure, body size, and change in ponderosity from childhood to adult life. Adult ponderosity is related to childhood ponderosity, and those who are most obese as adults show the greatest increase in weight for height from their childhood years. These observations suggest that strategies to prevent the acquisition of excess ponderosity during adolescence may be useful in preventing adult hypertension.\r"

The occurrence of diabetic microangiopathy in patients with cystic fibrosis has been reported recently. From 1978 to 1987, 19 patients with cystic fibrosis and diabetes mellitus were followed up. Four patients (21%) had evidence of diabetic microangiopathy. In one, peripheral neuropathy developed 5 years after the onset of diabetes mellitus, and the other 3 patients each had complications of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy which developed 10 years after the onset of diabetes mellitus. All were poorly compliant in their medical care. Significant morbidity was seen in the 3 patients with multisystem involvement--blindness, glaucoma, hypertension, and renal failure. The combination of long-standing diabetes mellitus, poor glycemic control, plus pathophysiologic features associated with cystic fibrosis may have contributed to the development of microangiopathy. The use of steroids in 4 other patients and dextrose infusions (as part of hyperalimentation) in another 4 patients precipitated or exacerbated diabetes. The data indicate that diabetic microangiopathy can occur in the individual with cystic fibrosis. Routine screening for diabetes and its complications in the population with cystic fibrosis, as well as optimal control of hyperglycemia, is warranted.\r"

A double-blind, placebo-control, within-subject (crossover) design was used, in which each child was tested four times in each drug condition. Drug conditions were alternated on a bidaily basis and each child received two different drug conditions each day. The academic tasks were designed for evaluation of the relationship between task complexity and dose. Whereas overt behavior improved with increasing dose, academic functioning was improved with methylphenidate, but did not vary with either dose or task complexity. Also, investigated were potential carryover effects of a morning dose of methylphenidate on performance in the afternoon. Behavioral and academic improvements produced by a dose of 0.3 mg/kg in the morning were no longer evident in the afternoon, but a morning dose of 1.0 mg/kg produced behavioral improvements that were clinically and statistically discernible in the afternoon, although the academic improvements had dissipated.\r"

All subjects had required assisted ventilation in the neonatal period and 16 had a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Each infant was studied in both supine and semisitting positions, and in each body position the infants were studied with neutral, flexed, and extended neck positions. Baseline measurements (body supine, neck neutral) and the response to postural changes did not differ between infants who had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those who had not. Change in body position from supine to semisitting decreased total pulmonary resistance (P less than .05) and increased specific lung compliance (P less than .01). Neck flexion increased resistance (P less than .001) in both body positions but did not influence compliance. These postural effects are consistent with an increase in functional residual capacity in the semisitting position and a decrease in pharyngeal area during neck flexion. Thus, posture needs to be precisely controlled during pulmonary function testing in infants. Furthermore, optimal neck and body position may improve their clinical status.\r"

The 45,X and 47,XXX propositae exhibited both gross and fine motor dysfunction, with 12 of 15 BOTMP composite scores below the 10th percentile. The clinical assessment confirmed the BOTMP findings, with 13 propositae exhibiting dysfunctional sensory-motor integration. A delay in the age of independent walking confirmed the consistency of motor developmental dysfunction throughout time. Sex chromosome mosaics were more similar to control girls. The gross and fine motor delays were frequently associated with a moderate to severe language dysfunction which adversely affected classroom performance. Regular developmental assessments of children with sex chromosome aneuploidy, including sensory-motor integration, should assist in the identification of early developmental delays and permit appropriate intervention.\r"

Four-wheel ATVs remain on the market. A retrospective review of all ATV injuries seen in a level I pediatric trauma center was conducted to compare the nature and severity of injuries in three-wheel vehicles with those associated with four-wheelers. A total of 36 ATV injuries were seen from April 1986 to August 1988. All patients were less than 16 years of age; 72% were less than or equal to 12 years of age. Of the patients, 56% were boys; 44% were girls. Although 56% of incidents involved three-wheelers, a larger number of more serious injuries, defined as the presence of indicators of injury severity (eg, death, Injury Severity Score greater than or equal to 10, intensive care unit admission, or need for surgery), involved four-wheel vehicles. A total of 15 injuries occurred in 1987; 12 injuries, including the first death involving an ATV at the pediatric trauma center, occurred in the 7 months since the sales ban. Immature judgment and/or motor skills were the most common factors contributing to injury. Existing information regarding injuries involving three-wheel ATVs is supported by our data, according to which it is suggested that four-wheel vehicles may be dangerous in the hands of immature or unskilled operators less than 16 years of age. Injury prevention efforts should be directed at prohibiting any ATV use by persons less than 16 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "This analysis of a sample of 15,181 adolescents aged 10 to 18 years from the National Health Interview Survey indicates that 86% of adolescents had some form of private or public health care coverage during 1984. Nevertheless, one in every seven adolescents, or nearly 4.5 million nationwide, were without any form of health insurance coverage. Adolescents without insurance coverage were concentrated in poor and near-poor households, families with little formal education, and were more likely to live in the South or West. Minorities, especially Hispanic adolescents, were less likely than white adolescents to have some form of health insurance coverage, but much of this difference was attributable to the smaller incomes of minorities. Similarly, although adolescents living in single-parent households were less likely to be insured, the reduced likelihood of coverage appears to be primarily attributable to smaller family income in single-parent households. That family economics plays a central role in determining whether an adolescent had some form of coverage was confirmed by interview results concerning the major reasons for absence of coverage; 8 of 10 uninsured families cited economic reasons for absence of coverage. Together, these results indicate the principal barriers to obtaining health insurance are economic in nature. Public and private sector initiatives for reducing the size of the uninsured adolescent population are discussed.\r"

The results indicated that 26% of 19 to 24-year-old persons had no health insurance protection, 65% were privately insured, 7% were publicly insured, and 1% had both private and public coverage. Young adults at greatest risk for being uninsured were male, Hispanic and black, poor and near-poor, unemployed, high school dropouts, living with others, and residing in the South and West. All young adults predictably lose or change health insurance as they move from dependence to independence. It was concluded that greater use of new and existing transitional insurance options should be offered as well as targeted educational and communication strategies to assure that all young persons enter adulthood with some basic insurance protection.\r"

  ".U": "89385762\r", 
  ".W": "Despite the popular current distinction between \"proportional\" and \"disproportional\" intrauterine growth retardation, it has never been shown that variation in body proportions is greater among growth-retarded than nongrowth-retarded infants of the same birth weight, nor that proportionality is distributed bimodally among growth-retarded infants. Based on a cohort of 8719 neonates born between 1980 and 1986 of mothers with concordant (+/- 7 days) menstrual dating and early ultrasound estimates of gestational age, we used a continuous measure of birth weight for gestational age to define four study groups: nongrowth retarded (n = 5163) and mild (n = 411), moderate (n = 226), and severe (n = 147) intrauterine growth retardation. Compared with non-growth-retarded infants of the same gestational age, growth-retarded infants had substantially lower lengths, head circumferences, and proportionality ratios, and the magnitude of the deficits increased significantly with increasing degrees of growth retardation. When the comparison was based on birth weight rather than gestational age, however, growth-retarded infants had slightly but significantly greater lengths and head circumferences, with increased variability in body proportions, but no evidence of the bimodality that would characterize two distinct subtypes. The analysis suggests that proportionality among intrauterine growth-retarded infants represents a continuum, with progressive disproportionality as severity of growth retardation increases. Moreover, despite evidence of some \"sparing,\" the absolute magnitudes of the deficits in length and head growth remain substantial.\r"

Alcoholics are at risk for relapse, so physicians should be patient and positive in their approach. Especially in the elderly, obtaining a list of all prescribed and over-the-counter medications used is an important starting point. Nonessential drugs should be discontinued and use of any others closely monitored. If a withdrawal syndrome results from discontinuation of alcohol, thiamine, multivitamins, and sedatives should be prescribed as clinically indicated. Treatment of any underlying psychiatric disorder is important. Psychosocial intervention is essential in dealing with recovering elderly alcoholics to overcome loneliness and to enhance sobriety. A formal rehabilitative effort is mandatory. Long-term rehabilitation focuses on group support and may include use of disulfiram (Antabuse).\r"

Symptoms of infectious keratitis are pain and loss of vision. Signs include infiltration or loss of clarity of the cornea, eyelid swelling, and purulent discharge. If an infectious process is suspected, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist immediately. If this is not possible, the contact lens should be removed and a culture performed, if possible. Aminoglycoside antibiotic drops should be applied frequently until ophthalmologic consultation is obtained. Patients should be reminded of the need for strict adherence to disinfection techniques and avoidance of homemade saline preparations. They should also be told to discontinue use of contact lenses at the first sign of ocular irritation or inflammation and to report to their physician if inflammation persists.\r"

The derivative cell lines carried either a cDNA or a minigene of human TK under the control of TK promoters of different lengths. A tenth cell line carried a human TK cDNA under the control of a simian virus 40 promoter. Two different assays were used to determine the S-phase-specific regulation of human TK mRNA levels in quiescent cells stimulated to proliferate. Results from these two assays indicated that (i) the first two introns of the human TK gene had no effect on the S-phase-specific regulation of TK mRNA levels, although the presence of introns increased the amount of TK mRNA; (ii) similar amounts of TK mRNA were present in cells containing constructs with an 83-base-pair (bp) promoter as with other TK promoters comprising up to approximately 4000 bp of 5' flanking sequence; (iii) a 456-bp promoter was fully S-phase-regulated, whereas the 83-bp promoter was only partially regulated; (iv) a 63-bp promoter was much less regulated than an 83-bp promoter; and (v) the crucial element in the 20-bp fragment comprising bp -83 to -64 has been localized, by site-directed mutagenesis, to the CCAAT element at -70.\r"

Upon addition of dog pancreatic rough microsomes, nascent polypeptides generated from the three mRNAs translocated into vesicles. Dispersal of the vesicles with Triton X-114 detergent and incubation of the hydrophobic phase with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C and D, enzymes specific for GPL-anchor structures, released Thy-1 and DAF but not IgR protein into the aqueous phase.

Sequence-specific 1H resonance assignments were made for the first 60 amino acid residues. The secondary structure of this part of the protein contains three alpha-helices in the peptide segments 8-20, 28-35, and 41-54. The last helix has a distortion around residues 47-48. The peptide segment 28-47 shows weak homology with other helix-turn-helix proteins. To investigate the spatial structure of this region of the molecule distance-geometry calculations were performed based on proton-proton distance constraints from nuclear Overhauser effects. The resulting structure shows that the segment 28-47 contains two helices with a loop region between them. The relative orientation of the two helices is similar to that found in helix-turn-helix proteins, but the helices are further apart, with the phenyl ring of Phe-37 located between them. The Brookhaven Protein Data Bank was searched for structurally homologous peptide segments in other proteins. The result of this search was that the two-helical structure of LexA is not more closely related to the canonical helix-turn-helix motif than it is to similar substructures found in other classes of proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Rhodopsin is a member of an ancient class of receptors that transduce signals through their interaction with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). We have mapped the sites of interaction of rhodopsin with its G protein, which by analogy suggests how other members of this class of receptors may interact with their G proteins. Three regions of rhodopsin's cytoplasmic surface interact with the rod cell G protein transducin (Gt). These are (i) the second cytoplasmic loop, which connects rhodopsin helices III and IV, (ii) the third cytoplasmic loop, which connects rhodopsin helices V and VI, and (iii) a putative fourth cytoplasmic loop formed by amino acids 310-321, as the carboxyl-terminal sequence emerges from helix VII and anchors to the lipid bilayer via palmitoylcysteines 322 and 323. Evidence for these regions of interaction of rhodopsin and Gt comes from the ability of synthetic peptides comprising these regions to compete with metarhodopsin II for binding to Gt. A spectroscopic assay that measures the \"extra MII\" caused by Gt binding was used to measure the extent of binding of Gt in the presence of competing peptides. The three peptides corresponding to the second, third, and fourth cytoplasmic loops competed effectively with metarhodopsin II, exhibiting Kd values in the 2 microM range; 11 additional peptides comprising all remaining surface regions of rhodopsin failed to compete even at 200 microM. Any two peptides that were effective competitors showed a synergistic effect, having 15 times higher effectiveness when mixed than when assayed separately. A mathematical model was developed to describe this behavior.\r"

  ".W": "The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase catalyzes the posttranslational modification of specific glutamic acid residues to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues within the vitamin K-dependent proteins. This enzyme recognizes the gamma-carboxylation recognition site on the propeptide of the precursor forms of the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins. To purify this enzyme to homogeneity, the carboxylase from bovine liver microsomes was solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), the protein was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and then the enzyme was isolated by affinity chromatography using a synthetic peptide based upon the structure of the prothrombin propeptide. Elution with 10 mM propeptide yielded a single major band on SDS gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 77,000. In the presence of high concentrations of propeptide, only minimal carboxylase activity was measurable. Antibodies to the protein inhibited the carboxylase activity in crude preparations. In an alternative affinity purification strategy the propeptide was coupled through an NH2-terminal cysteine to an activated thiol-Sepharose column. The carboxylase-propeptide complex was eluted at 25 degrees C by reductive cleavage of the enzyme-propeptide complex in the presence of detergent and phospholipids. The eluted protein (Mr, 77,000) contained both stable vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and vitamin K epoxidase activity. The protein, purified by either method, was detected as a single band (Mr, 77,000) in a Western blot using anti-carboxylase antibodies. A 10,000-fold purification of carboxylase activity from crude microsomes was estimated. Purified bovine liver vitamin K-dependent carboxylase should facilitate the study of its structure and of the mechanism of action of vitamin K as a cofactor in the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the structure of the high molecular weight, growth hormone-dependent complex between the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and their binding proteins in human serum, we have reconstituted the complex from its purified component proteins and analyzed it by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography after covalent cross-linking. The proteins tested in reconstitution mixtures were an acid-labile Mr 84,000-86,000 glycoprotein doublet (alpha subunit), an acid-stable Mr 47,000-53,000 glycoprotein doublet with IGF-binding activity (BP-53 or beta subunit), and IGF-I or IGF-II (gamma subunit). In incubations containing any one of the three subunits 125I-labeled and the other two unlabeled, identical 125I-labeled alpha-beta-gamma complexes of Mr 140,000 were formed. Minor bands of Mr 120,000 and 90,000 were also seen, thought to represent a partially deglycosylated form of the alpha-beta-gamma complex, and an alpha-gamma complex arising as a cross-linking artifact. When serum samples from subjects of various growth hormone status were affinity-labeled with IGF-II tracer, a growth hormone-dependent Mr 140,000 band was seen, corresponding to the reconstituted alpha-beta-gamma complex. Other growth hormone-dependent labeled bands, of Mr 90,000 (corresponding to alpha-gamma), Mr 55,000-60,000 (corresponding to labeled beta-subunit doublet), and smaller bands of Mr 38,000, 28,000, and 23,000-25,000 (corresponding to labeled beta-subunit degradation products), were also seen in the affinity-labeled serum samples and in the complex reconstituted from pure proteins. All were immunoprecipitable with an anti-BP-53 antiserum. We conclude that the growth hormone-dependent Mr 140,000 IGF-binding protein complex in human serum has three components: the alpha (acid-labile) subunit, the beta (binding) subunit, and the gamma (growth factor) subunit.\r"

Compared with the sequence of a teratoma cDNA-encoded pump these clones specify isoforms that contain either 29- or 38-amino acid insertions within the calmodulin-binding region. Replacement of two basic arginine residues by an aspartic acid and a glutamine residue could influence the binding of calmodulin to these isoforms. RNase mapping shows that RNA species containing the 29-residue-encoding insertion are particularly abundant in skeletal muscles. The sequences coding for the insertions are present on a single 154-base-pair exon, as demonstrated by an analysis of the corresponding genomic region, and they are included in their respective mRNAs by alternative splicing involving the differential usage of two internal \"cryptic\" donor splice sites in the presence of a nearby canonical one. Inclusion of the complete 154-base-pair exon results in an mRNA coding for a pump protein with a shorter C-terminal amino acid sequence that lacks a consensus site for phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent kinase. Exclusion, inclusion, or partial inclusion of the same exon can thus lead to the production of four different mRNAs from a single gene. When expressed as protein, these mRNAs encode Ca2+ pump isoforms that differ in their C-terminal regulatory domains.\r"

The expressed CEH activity was highly dependent on the presence of trihydroxy bile salts (cholate or one of its conjugates); maximum hydrolytic activity was observed in the presence of 10 mM sodium cholate. The expressed CEH was not activated by dihydroxy bile salts (deoxycholate and its conjugates). In the presence of 10 mM sodium cholate, the CEH activity was maximal near pH 7 but was significant between pH 6 and 8. Monospecific immune IgG raised against rat pancreatic CEH completely inhibited the CEH expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine enzyme inhibitor, was inhibitory to the expressed CEH activity, whereas p-chloromercuribenzoate (up to 5 mM), a potent thiol-blocking agent, did not significantly inhibit the expressed activity. These experiments clearly demonstrate that the liver contains an mRNA encoding a bile salt-dependent CEH activity and suggest that the uptake of pancreatic enzyme is not necessarily the source of liver CEH as has been speculated.\r"

The statistics of priming indicate that a primer library sufficient for determining the sequence of the entire human genome (100,000 cosmids) would be small enough to be assembled and managed. Such a library would greatly reduce the cost and effort of high-volume sequencing: primers would be instantly available; the sequence of each cosmid DNA could be determined from a single DNA preparation without the necessity for mapping or subcloning; and, because each primer would be used repeatedly, the cost of primers would become a negligible fraction of other costs. A combination of random and directed priming could determine the sequence of a cosmid DNA in 1.2-1.5 times the minimum number of sequencing reactions required, and completely directed priming would be even more efficient. The success of this strategy requires that a considerable fraction of octamers, nonamers, or decamers be able to prime selectively in double-stranded DNAs 45,000 base pairs (bp) long; initial results indicate that this is likely to be the case. The strategy is not limited to cloned DNAs and would be useful for rapid identification and direct sequencing of viral nucleic acids.\r"

However, recent 15N NMR studies of alpha-lytic protease (EC 3.4.21.12) in solution have shown that some boronic acids and peptide boronic acids form adducts with the active-site histidine instead of with the serine. Such histidine-boron adducts have not thus far been reported in x-ray diffraction studies of boronic acid-serine protease complexes. Here, we report an 15N NMR study of the MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-boroPhe complex of alpha-lytic protease in the crystalline state using magic-angle spinning. Previous 15N NMR studies have shown this complex involves the formation of a histidine-boron bond in solution. The 15N NMR spectra of the crystalline complex are essentially identical to those of the complex in solution, thereby showing that the structure of this complex is the same in solution and in the crystal and that both involve formation of a histidine-boron adduct.\r"

A nuclear factor, designated CG-1, specifically recognizes a hexameric motif with internal dyad symmetry, CACGTG, located within this light-responsive sequence. Binding of CG-1 is influenced by C-methylation of the CpG dinucleotide in the recognition sequence. CG-1 is a factor found in a variety of dicotyledonous plant species including Nicotiana tabacum, A. majus, Petunia hybrida, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Glycine max. CACGTG motifs contained within trans-acting factor recognition sites in various other plant promoters can interact with CG-1. In addition, the binding site of the human adenovirus major late transcription factor USF can compete for CG-1 binding to the chalcone synthase promoter. This suggests an evolutionary conservation of trans-acting factor recognition sites involved in divergent mechanisms of gene control.\r"

Melittin binds tightly to calmodulin in the presence of calcium and is a competitive inhibitor of calmodulin function. Using melittin as a model for the target peptide of calmodulin, we have found a large Ca2+-dependent conformational change of calmodulin in solution induced by peptide binding. Mg2+ does not substitute for Ca2+ in producing the conformation change. Small-angle x-ray scattering has shown that calmodulin exists as a dumbbell in solution, similar to that observed in the crystalline state. Our present measurements reveal that the overall structure of the Ca2+-calmodulin-melittin complex is not a dumbbell but a globular shape. Upon binding melittin, the radius of gyration decreases from 20.9 to 18.0 A and the largest dimension decreases from 60 to 47.5 A. In the absence of calcium, however, melittin has little effect on the solution structure of calmodulin.\r"

In the region of saturated conductance of boride ion, the increase in conductivity is 3.6-fold. A 15-fold increase is observed with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone. In this case the net charge gated is 300 times greater than the photogenerated charge in the bilayer membrane. Thus there is a net gain in this organic field effect phototransistor.

The study of the multiple reaction paths in this 48-atom molecule became possible due to development of a new computational algorithm. It is shown that the helix-coil transitions in IAN follow a sequence of local dihedral flips and that the number of the available routes for the transition is significantly lower than in a random search. A quasi-melting point is obtained at 5 +/- 1 kcal (1 cal = 4.18 J)/mol above the lowest energy minimum.

The enzyme was stable at 4 degrees C and at room temperature for at least 1 month. Native and subunit molecular weights of 38,000 and 36,500, respectively, suggest the enzyme is a monomer. The isoelectric point was pH 3.9 as determined by isoelectric focusing. Staining with periodic acid-Schiff and fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A reagents indicate this enzyme is a glycoprotein. In contrast to (R)-mandelonitrile lyases isolated from Prunus species, the Ximenia lyase does not appear to be a flavoprotein. A second enzyme that eluted from the chromatofocusing column at pH 4.0 was also active toward mandelonitrile. However, this form accounted for less than 10% of the total activity, and its specific activity was only 6% of that of the major component. Additional physical and kinetic studies suggested this activity may be due to a nonspecific enzyme that is active toward mandelonitrile.\r"

Local iontophoretic application of Ca (or Sr or Ba) to any site along the length of demembranated macrocilia in ATP-Mg solution elicits oscillatory bending. Bending responses are localized to the site of application of these cations and do not propagate. Ca sensitivity for initiating bends is, therefore, distributed along the entire length of the axonemes. Since Ca triggers ATP-dependent microtubule sliding disintegration of macrociliary axonemes, a Ca-sensitive mechanism for activating microtubule sliding extends the length of the axonemes. In contrast, local application of Ca to living dissociated macrociliary cells elicits beating only when applied to the base of the macrocilium, indicating that the effective site of Ca entry is localized to the membrane at the ciliary base. Therefore, the spatial distributions of membrane Ca permeability and axonemal Ca sensors do not coincide.\r"

By using the drug brefeldin A to block intracellular transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex, the translocated precursors were shown to accumulate in the ER, while the untranslocated forms were rapidly degraded with an intracellular half-life of approximately 20 min. Brefeldin A did not inhibit the synthesis of fatty acylation of the precursors but substantially delayed their acquisition of O-linked oligosaccharides, which indicates that murine glycophorins are fatty acylated in the ER and O-glycosylated in the Golgi complex. Even after 6 hr in brefeldin A, glycophorins were only partially glycosylated, resulting in the accumulation of glycoproteins apparently sialylated but lower in apparent molecular mass than mature glycophorins. Complete glycophorin processing resumed only after removal of the drug. In murine erythroleukemia cells, brefeldin A caused a rapid and extensive disorganization of the entire Golgi complex accompanied by the accumulation of membranes in a part of the ER closely associated with ER transitional elements. These findings extend recently published results [Lippincott-Schwartz, J., Yuan, L. C., Bonifacino, J. S. & Klausner, R. D. (1989) Cell 56, 801-813] and suggest that brefeldin A induces net membrane flow from the entire Golgi complex to the ER.\r"

The two mRNAs are regulated independently and in some circumstances in opposite directions under several physiological conditions. The production of a polyadenylylated mRNA from an otherwise cell cycle-regulated histone gene may allow for continued synthesis of the histone protein when DNA synthesis ceases in nondividing cells.\r"

These peroxisome-deficient nuclear hybrids closely resemble the original mutant cells by biochemical criteria, but their modal chromosome number is 36-38, the same as that of CHO hybrids generated from intact cells. When the peroxisome-deficient nuclear hybrids are fused to wild-type cytoplasts, a fraction of the fusion products (at least 70%) continue to propagate normal peroxisomes indefinitely. Peroxisome biogenesis cannot be reinitiated in cells of mutant ZR-78.1 by fusion to wild-type cytoplasts. Our results suggest that a wild-type nucleus by itself is necessary but not sufficient for restoration of normal peroxisome biogenesis and that a cytoplasmic component of wild-type cells, possibly a normal peroxisome, is also required.\r"

  ".U": "89386676\r", 
  ".W": "Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are cell surface glycoproteins that may play a variety of roles in morphogenesis and histogenesis, particularly in defining borders of discrete cell populations. To examine the influence of CAM expression on such cell segregation events in vitro, we have transfected cells with cDNAs coding for two calcium-dependent CAMs of different specificity, the liver CAM (L-CAM) and the structurally related molecule N-cadherin. The cDNAs were introduced separately or together into murine sarcoma S180 cells, which normally do not express these molecules, to produce cell lines denoted S180L, S180cadN, and S180L/cadN, respectively. A number of cell lines of each type were produced that differed in their levels of CAM expression. In adhesion assays, S180L and S180cadN cells aggregated specifically via their respective CAMs, and S180L cells did not appear to adhere to S180cadN cells. Cells expressing high levels of each CAM aggregated more rapidly than cells expressing low levels. Segregation between two cell types occurred when they expressed CAMs of different specificity or different levels of the same CAM. S180L and S180cadN cells both sorted out from untransfected cells, and cells expressing high levels of either L-CAM or N-cadherin segregated from cells expressing low levels of the same CAM; in all cases segregation was inhibited by antibodies specific for the transfected CAM. S180L cells sorted out from S180cadN cells, but this segregation was inhibited only when antibodies to both CAMs were applied together. Doubly transfected S180L/cadN cells also sorted out from S180L cells and from S180cadN cells, and the process was inhibited by antibodies to the unshared CAM (N-cadherin or L-CAM, respectively). Cytochalasin D and nocodazole inhibited sorting-out, consistent with the probable role of microfilaments and microtubules in cell movement and in accord with evidence that the action of these CAMs depends on interactions with cortical cytoplasmic components. Using cDNAs for only two CAMs in these studies, we could distinguish at least eight cell lines by their behavior in sorting-out assays. This suggests that qualitative and quantitative differences in the expression in vivo of a relatively small number of CAMs can lead to a large variety of patterns among cell collectives and their borders during tissue formation.\r"

As reconstructed here, this organism had a complex metabolism that included dehydrogenations, transmethylations, carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, and an energy metabolism based on phosphate esters. Furthermore, the breakthrough organism probably used DNA to store genetic information, biosynthesized porphyrins, and used terpenes as its major lipid component.

We estimated the rate of synonymous (silent) substitution for hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10(-5) per site per year. Applying this rate to the phylogenetic tree, we estimated that duck hepatitis B virus diverged from a common ancestor about 30,000 years ago at the earliest, that woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus diverged about 10,000 years ago, and that hepatitis B virus diverged within the last 3000 years. Because these divergence times of the viruses are much more recent than those of the host species, it suggests that the hepadnavirus family evolved independently of host-species divergence.\r"

We used the polymerase chain reaction technique to amplify and clone an 882-base-pair DNA fragment spanning one of these HS, designated HSII, which is located 54 kilobases upstream of the beta-globin gene. The cloned HSII fragment was linked to a human beta-globin gene in either the genomic (HSII-beta) or antigenomic (HSII-beta) orientation. These two constructs and a beta-globin gene alone (beta) were injected into fertilized mouse eggs, and expression was analyzed in liver and brain from day-16 transgenic fetuses. Five of 7 beta-transgenic fetuses expressed human beta-globin mRNA, but the level of expression per gene copy was low, ranging from 0.93 to 22.4% of mouse alpha-globin mRNA (average 9.9%). In contrast, 11 of 12 HSII-beta transgenic fetuses expressed beta-globin mRNA at levels per gene copy ranging from 31.3 to 336.6% of mouse alpha-globin mRNA (average 139.5%). Only three fetuses containing intact copies of the HSII-beta construct were produced. Two of three expressed human beta-globin mRNA at levels per gene copy of 179.2 and 387.1%. Expression of human beta-globin mRNA was tissue-specific in all three types of transgenic fetuses. These studies demonstrate that a small DNA fragment containing a single erythroid-specific HS can stimulate high-level human beta-globin gene expression in transgenic mice.\r"

Here we report that BALB/c mice can be actively immunized against progesterone, and hence against pregnancy, by means of rabbit anti-idiotypic antibodies specific for a mouse monoclonal anti-progesterone antibody, DB3. Some of the anti-idiotypic antibodies reacted with the steroid-combining site on the DB3 molecule. In response to repeated anti-idiotypic immunization, mice produced serum anti-progesterone antibodies (up to 100 micrograms/ml) that resembled DB3 in idiotypy, affinity, and specificity for progesterone and other steroid ligands. Thus an anti-idiotype can mimic the antigenicity of a steroid hormone with a high degree of accuracy. Compared with immunization with a progesterone-bovine serum albumin conjugate, the anti-progesterone response to anti-idiotype was considerably lower and clonally restricted. When mated after completion of the immunization course, the fertility rate of anti-idiotype-immunized mice was reduced to 30% from a control level of 91%. The anti-fertility effect was correlated with the circulating anti-progesterone concentration in individual animals and persisted for 4 or 5 estrous cycles. Active immunization with progesterone-bovine serum albumin was a highly effective means of rendering mice infertile; it reduced the fertility rate to zero over 16 or 17 estrous cycles. Our results suggest that anti-idiotypes may form the basis of contraceptive vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a 749-amino acid type II integral membrane protein that has been identified recently as the neutral endopeptidase 24.11 [NEP (EC 3.4.24.11)]. Herein, we characterize the organization of the human CALLA/NEP gene and show that it spans more than 80 kilobases (kb) and is composed of 24 exons. Exons 1 and 2 encode 5' untranslated sequences; exon 3 [170 base pairs (bp)] encodes the initiation codon and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain; 20 short exons (exons 4-23), ranging in size from 36 to 162 bp, encode most of the extracellular portion of the enzyme; and exon 24 (approximately 3400 bp) encodes the COOH-terminal 32 amino acids of the protein and contains the entire 3' untranslated region (UTR). Of note, the pentapeptide sequence (His-Glu-Ile-Thr-His) associated with metalloprotease zinc binding and substrate catalysis is encoded within a single exon (exon 19). Three types of CALLA/NEP cDNAs have been identified: these clones contain 5' UTR sequences differing from one another upstream of exon 3. These human 5' sequences are homologous to those found in rat brain and rabbit kidney NEP cDNAs. The three human CALLA cDNA types result from alternative splicing of exons 1, 2a, or 2b to the common exon 3. Moreover, exons 2a and 2b share the same 5' sequence but differ from each other by the use of two distinct donor splice sites 171 bp apart in the gene. The substantial conservation of 5' untranslated sequences among species and the existence of 5' alternative splicing suggest that CALLA gene expression may be differentially controlled in a tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated fashion.\r"

The protein, which we have designated complement cytolysis inhibitor (CLI), has a molecular mass of 70 kDa and consists of two nonidentical, disulfide-linked subunits of 35 kDa. Partial amino acid sequences determined for the amino-termini of the two subunits were identical with those of a recently characterized serum protein called SP-40,40. An almost full-length cDNA clone of 1651 base pairs was isolated from a human liver cDNA library by using long synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. The encoded amino acid sequence of CLI consists of 427 amino acid residues preceded by a 21-residue-long typical signal peptide and shows an overall 75.6% amino acid sequence homology to sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2), a major Sertoli cell-derived protein of rat testis fluid. As in SGP-2, proteolytic processing between residues 206 and 207 yields the two disulfide-linked subunits of plasma CLI. CLI and SGP-2 were shown to be orthologous single-copy genes in humans and rats by Southern blotting experiments. In addition, CLI was immunologically identified in human seminal plasma. Functional studies with purified terminal complement components showed that CLI suppresses the cytolytic potential of nascent C5b-7 complexes at physiological blood plasma concentrations (approximately 50 micrograms/ml). Its presence on the surface of mature sperm cells and its relative abundance in seminal plasma (approximately 250 micrograms/ml) suggest that CLI protects sperm cells and epithelial tissues against complement attack in the male reproductive tract.\r"

  ".W": "cGMP is a second messenger that mediates numerous metabolic events; in the present work a role in myeloid cell differentiation was demonstrated. Nitroprusside and NaNO2, which activate cytosolic guanylate cyclase and increase the intracellular cGMP concentration, induced granulocytic differentiation of the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60; differentiation was measured by acquisition of the OKM1 antigen, morphological changes, and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. When theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which by itself induced modest differentiation, was added to nitroprusside or NaNO2, differentiation increased in an additive fashion. The degree of differentiation correlated with the increase in the intracellular cGMP concentration. 8-Bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, a membrane-permeable cGMP analogue, also induced differentiation of HL-60 cells but was much more effective in the presence of theophylline, with the two agents interacting synergistically. The effect of theophylline in these studies could not be attributed to increasing the intracellular cAMP concentration. Dimethyl sulfoxide, and established inducer of differentiation of HL-60 cells, markedly enhanced the differentiation induced by nitroprusside and NaNO2.\r"

Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, increased levels of thrombomodulin mRNA, as measured in an S1 nuclease protection assay, to 2.5-4.0 times control levels. Thrombomodulin transcription in response to cycloheximide treatment, as determined by nuclear run-on analysis, was 3.9 +/- 1.3 (mean +/- SD) times that found in untreated cells. Thrombin also increased thrombomodulin mRNA levels to 151 +/- 21% (mean +/- SD) of control levels after 2 hr. Transcription increased in response to thrombin by 2.1- to 7.3-fold. The combination of thrombin and cycloheximide had no additive effect on thrombomodulin mRNA levels. Thrombin treatment of hemangioma cells also caused an increase in thrombomodulin protein synthesis to 142 +/- 17% (mean +/- SD) of control levels as determined by immunoprecipitation of [32S]methionine-labeled thrombomodulin. We conclude that thrombomodulin expression is determined in part by the rate of transcription and that thrombomodulin mRNA levels in hemangioma cells are increased by treatment with cycloheximide or thrombin. The increased transcription in response to cycloheximide suggests the existence of a labile protein repressor of thrombomodulin transcription.\r"

We examined the possibility of an extramammary role of PLP by measuring its levels in serum and milk of lactating women. The levels of PLP by radioimmunoassay in serum of lactating and nonlactating women were indistinguishable [4.2 +/- 1.8 and 3.6 +/- 1.0 pg equivalents (eq) of PLP-(1-34) amide per ml, respectively]. As PLP was undetectable in some serum samples, this result does not exclude the possibility that lactation results in a small increase in serum levels of PLP. In contrast, high concentrations of immunoreactive PLP [40,000-75,000 pg eq of PLP-(1-34) amide per ml] and correspondingly high concentrations of bioactive PLP were found in human, rat, and bovine milk. A variety of processed bovine milk products had a PLP content similar to that of fresh bovine milk, whereas infant formulas had lower concentrations, ranging down to undetectable. Although the physiological role of PLP in lactation is unknown, the data establish the presence of PLP in milk and suggest the possibility that PLP may be important in neonatal calcium homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Astrocytomas, including glioblastoma multiforme, represent the most frequent and deadly primary neoplasms of the human nervous system. Despite a number of previous cytogenetic and oncogene studies primarily focusing on malignant astrocytomas, the primary mechanism of tumor initiation has remained obscure. The loss or inactivation of \"tumor suppressor\" genes are thought to play a fundamental role in the development of many human cancers. Thus, we have analyzed astrocytomas of various histological malignancy grades with polymorphic DNA markers to search for specific chromosomal deletions potentially pointing to loci containing tumor suppressor genes. Loss of constitutional heterozygosity indicating chromosomal loss or deletions was most frequently seen for markers on the short arm of chromosome 17 in 50% of the informative tumors (5 of 10 informative cases) and, to a lesser extent, for markers on chromosomes 1 and 10. Deletions on chromosome 17p were seen in both low-grade and high-grade malignant astrocytomas, suggesting that this chromosome may contain a tumor suppressor gene associated with the early events in tumorigenesis. The common region of deletions on the short arm of chromosome 17 is, therefore, clearly distinct from the gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), a tumor syndrome associated with glial tumors that maps to the long arm of chromosome 17. The search for progressively smaller deletions on chromosome 17p in astrocytomas may be the way to clone and characterize this locus, thus leading to insights into normal and abnormal growth and differentiation of glial cells.\r"

The background frequency of allelic loss was obtained from data using 3 other loci on the 1q arm and 2 on the p arm of chromosome 1. With these markers, only 6 of 62 informative patients (8%) showed an allelic loss, with the range being 0-13%. The allelic losses seen on 1q, which were found in 9 carcinomas, comprised an overlapping set; the common region deleted was approximately 26 centimorgans on the q arm of chromosome 1 (bands q23-32 between AT3 and D1S53).

SAIDS is etiologically linked to infection by a type D retrovirus, SAIDS retrovirus (SRV). Immunization with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine was shown to protect macaques against infection by SRV serotype 1. To identify the antigen(s) responsible for eliciting protective immunity, we have constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus (v-senv5) that expresses the envelope glycoproteins of SRV serotype 2 (SRV-2/W). Pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) immunized with v-senv5 showed lymphoproliferative responses to purified SRV-2/W. They also generated antibodies that neutralized SRV-2/W infectivity in vitro and mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SRV-2-infected cells. Four v-senv5-immunized animals, together with four control animals, were challenged intravenously with 5 x 10(3) tissue culture infectious doses of SRV-2/W. As early as 2 weeks after challenge, three of four control animals became viremic, and two of these three animals also seroconverted. The animal that was viremic but remained antibody negative died of symptoms of SRV infection 6 1/2 weeks after challenge. In contrast, all four v-senv5-immunized animals remained healthy, virus-free, and seropositive against only the immunizing envelope antigens. These results indicate that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the envelope antigens of SRV-2/W protects primates from infection by a retrovirus that causes immunodeficiency diseases.\r"

The spatial patterns formed by the growing neurites were analyzed using conventional and fractal measures (Hausdorff dimension, H) of their extent and complexity. The results presented were obtained from the arborizations formed by the neurites of 48 labeled and isolated ganglion cells growing separate from each other and separate from a feeder layer of astrocytes. Cells were obtained from animals when the RGCs were postmitotic and after dendritic differentiation in vivo at age 0-1 week (4/48), 2-5 weeks (35/48), or 6-8 weeks (9/48). By 48 hr after plating, the number of surviving labeled RGCs was reduced to 22-28% of its initial value. After removal of all processes and isolation in vitro, these RGCs expressed neurite patterns strikingly similar to those seen in the intact retina, although the RGCs had been deprived of potential cues from the intact retina and target tissue. Self crossings of the growing neurites were rare (less than 0.5%, 20 cells, n = 2500 neurites). Calculation of the Hausdorff dimension, a metric for the space-filling capacity of the neurite patterns, revealed that after 3-day culture 77% (n = 56) of the RGCs achieved relatively uniform coverage of territory (1.6 less than H less than 1.9). This coverage was independent of the number of interbranchpoint segments and/or the total neurite length of a particular neurite pattern. A sample of dendritic arbors from RGCs in intact retina yielded similar values for the Hausdorff dimension (H = 1.73, SD = 0.12, n = 18, range 1.54-1.94). These results reveal that a mammalian central nervous system neuron, for at least 8 postnatal weeks, has the intrinsic capacity for reexpression of in vivo structure characteristic of that cell type in the absence of interaction with neighboring neurons, afferent input, and target tissue. These neurons exhibit stereotyped growth resulting in uniform coverage of a restricted territory by the strategic selection of the length, location, and orientation of interbranchpoint segments.\r"

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from these cells demonstrated a low-threshold, rapidly inactivating (T) Ca2+ current that manifested similar voltage dependency and time course as the low-threshold spike. Like low-threshold spikes, the T-type Ca2+ current was eliminated by nickel but was unaffected by nimodipine. In thalamic neurons, T-type Ca2+ channels underlie the low-threshold spike and, therefore, play a critical role in regulating the firing pattern of these cells.\r"

In this paper, the biosynthesis and release of L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and dopamine were analyzed in three heterologous cell lines after retroviral-mediated gene transfer of tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. A recombinant retrovirus encoding human tyrosine hydroxylase type I as well as neomycin-resistance gene was used to infect a fibroblast (NIH 3T3), a neuroblastoma (NS20 Y), and a neuroendocrine (AtT-20) cell line. After selection in the presence of neomycin and in tyrosine-free medium, high levels of exogenous tyrosine hydroxylase activity were detected in extracts of the three cell lines. High-performance liquid chromatography of cell extracts and culture supernatants confirmed that the three cell lines hydroxylated tyrosine to form L-DOPA and released this metabolite into the culture medium. Interestingly, the neuroendocrine cell line AtT-20 synthesized not only L-DOPA but also dopamine. Evoked secretion studies established that AtT-20 cells released the transmitter upon depolarization in a regulated, calcium-dependent way. We discuss the implication of this approach for the analyses of neurotransmitter release as well as in the context of degenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease.\r"

Averaged events show the typical activation and inactivation kinetics of macroscopic Na current. Three potential-dependent K channels were identified (I, F, and S channel). The I channel, being the most frequent type, has a single-channel conductance of 23 pS (inward current, 105 mM K on both sides of the membrane), activates between -60 and -30 mV, deactivates with intermediate kinetics, and is sensitive to dendrotoxin. The F channel has a conductance of 30 pS, activates between -40 and 60 mV, and deactivates with fast kinetics. The former inactivates within tens of seconds; the latter inactivates within seconds. The third type, the S channel, has a conductance of 7 pS and deactivates slowly. All three channels can be blocked by external tetraethylammonium chloride. We suggest that these distinct K channel types form the basis for the different components of macroscopic K current described previously.\r"

Alternative splicing of the alpha gene gives rise to the functional receptor, rTR alpha 1, and the non-thyroid hormone-binding isotype, rTR alpha 2. Recent evidence suggests the beta gene encodes two functional receptors, rTR beta 1, and the pituitary-specific receptor, rTR beta 2. By using synthetic DNA probes common to rTR beta transcripts and specific for rTR alpha 1 and rTR alpha 2 mRNAs, we mapped the expression of these transcripts in adult rat brain and pituitary by hybridization histochemistry. We also localized mRNAs encoding the putative nuclear receptor REV-ErbA alpha, a portion of which is derived from the opposite strand of the rTR alpha gene. rTR alpha 1 and rTR alpha 2 transcripts were widely distributed in a similar, if not identical, pattern. Highest levels of rTR alpha 1 and rTR alpha 2 transcripts were found in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. REV-ErbA alpha and rTR beta mRNAs were found in more restricted patterns of expression distinct from those of rTR alpha 1 and rTR alpha 2. REV-ErbA alpha mRNA was highest in the neocortex. High levels of rTR beta transcripts in the anterior pituitary and the parvocellular part of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus suggest rTR beta gene products may mediate thyroid hormone feedback regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Our results identify nuclei and structures in the mammalian central nervous system in which regulation of gene expression by specific thyroid hormone receptor subtypes may occur.\r"

  ".U": "89386720\r", 
  ".W": "The acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) at the neuromuscular junction of elapid snakes binds cholinergic ligands but unlike other muscle AcChoRs does not bind alpha-bungarotoxin. Numerous studies indicate that the ligand-binding site of the AcChoR includes cysteine residues at positions 192 and 193 of the alpha subunit. We have previously shown that a synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to residues 185-196 of the Torpedo AcChoR alpha subunit contains the essential elements of the ligand-binding site. In an attempt to elucidate the structural basis for the precise binding properties of snake AcChoR, we sequenced a portion of the snake AcChoR alpha subunit. First, a mouse AcChoR alpha-subunit cDNA probe was used to screen a size-selected snake (Natrix tessellata) genomic library. A genomic clone was isolated and was found to contain sequences homologous to the exon including the first two cysteines (Cys-128 and -142) of AcChoR alpha subunit. The domain of the alpha subunit from Natrix and cobra AcChoR (amino acid residues 119-222), which contains the four extracellular cysteines (128, 142, 192, and 193), was amplified by reverse transcription of mRNA and the polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that the snake alpha subunit contains the two tandem cysteines at positions 192 and 193, resembling all other AcChoR alpha subunits. Sequence comparison revealed that the cloned region of the snake alpha subunit is highly homologous (75-80%) to other muscle AcChoRs and not to neuronal AcChoR, which also does not bind alpha-bungarotoxin. In the presumed ligand-binding site, in the vicinity of Cys-192 and Cys-193, four major substitutions occur in the snake sequence--at positions 184 (Trp----Phe), 185 (Lys----Trp), 187 (Trp----Ser), and 194 (Pro----Leu). In addition, Asn-189 is a putative N-glycosylation site, present only in the snake. These changes, or part of them, may explain the lack of alpha-bungarotoxin-binding to snake AcChoR.\r"

The abundance of sulfated glycoprotein 2 RNA is increased in hippocampus from patients with Alzheimer disease and Pick disease, whereas transferrin RNA is not strongly modulated in these conditions. Expression of two previously identified scrapie-modulated genes, encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein and metallothionein, is also increased in both of these neurodegenerative diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Recent experiments have revealed tightly synchronized oscillatory discharges in local assemblies of cortical neurons as well as phase coherency of oscillations at distant cortical sites. These findings are consistent with the theory of neuronal group selection, a population theory of brain function that is based on the properties of local groups of neurons. A set of computer simulations shows that cooperative interactions within and among neuronal groups can generate the observed phenomena. In the simulations, oscillations within neuronal groups are generated through local excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Different groups in general oscillate in an uncorrelated fashion. Coherency of the oscillatory activity of different neuronal groups depends crucially on reciprocal reentrant signaling and can reflect the spatial continuity of a stimulus. Separated or discontinuous features of a given stimulus can be transiently associated in a temporally coherent pattern through reentrant signaling between groups in networks responding to different aspects of that stimulus. A simulation of reentrant activity between arrays of neuronal groups selective for oriented lines and pattern motion displays cross-correlations between groups that are responsive to different parts of a stimulus contour if these parts move together. Such coherency among neuronal groups might be used in the discrimination of a stimulus from other stationary or differentially moving elements in a visual scene.\r"

  ".W": "The growth and branching patterns of individual identified leech neurons in culture depend upon the molecular composition of the substrate. These differences in morphology have been analyzed quantitatively for nerve cells growing on the plant lectin Con A, on extracellular matrix extract (ECM) containing laminin, and on patterned substrates. The total length of neurite outgrowth was about four times greater, and the number of branching points per unit length was three times smaller on ECM laminin extract than on Con A. Single cells placed on a sharp well-defined border separating Con A and ECM-laminin extract sprouted neurites rapidly on both sides of the border without showing preference for either substrate. An individual nerve cell produced neurites with markedly different structure on the two substrates--curved and thick, with a higher branching frequency on Con A, but straight and slender with a lower branching frequency on ECM-laminin substrate. Similar changes were seen in individual neurites that crossed from one substrate to the other. These results show that local contact of the neuron with a particular substrate induces a particular pattern of local outgrowth. Hence, molecules anchored in extracellular matrix could provide information for regenerating or developing axons regarding the type of branching pattern to be produced in that region.\r"

  ".W": "Cl- currents elicited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) application were recorded with the whole-cell tight-seal technique from voltage-clamped cortical neurons of neonatal rats in primary culture. The peripheral benzodiazepine recognition site ligand 4'-chlorodiazepam [Ro 5-4864; 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2H-[1,4]-benzodiazep in-2- one] inhibited the GABA-generated currents in a dose-dependent manner. Also, a beta-carboline (DMCM; 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester), acting as a negative allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, reduced the intensity of GABA-generated currents with similar efficacy but greater potency. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 8-fluro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo-[1,5-a] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate ethyl ester) antagonized DMCM inhibition but not that elicited by 4'-chlorodiazepam. The isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195, an antagonist of 4'-chlorodiazepam effects in other systems, failed to antagonize the action of 4'-chlorodiazepam. The transient expression of various molecular forms of GABAA receptors in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 allowed a study of the minimal structural requirements for the inhibition of GABA-induced Cl- currents by bicuculline, picrotoxin, 4'-chlorodiazepam, and DMCM. GABA-elicited Cl- currents in cells coexpressing alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of GABAA receptors were inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin, but not by DMCM or 4'-chlorodiazepam. Conversely, the GABA currents in cells coexpressing alpha 1 beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits were inhibited by bicuculline, picrotoxin, 4'-chlorodiazepam, and DMCM. Since the Cl- currents generated by GABA in some molecular forms of GABAA receptors are inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin only, 4'-chlorodiazepam cannot be acting isosterically with picrotoxin.\r"

A method was developed to isolate ICC from the slow-wave pacemaker region of the canine proximal colon. These cells were identified under phase-contrast microscopy, and their identity was verified by comparing their ultrastructure with the morphology of ICC in situ. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that these cells are excitable; voltage-dependent inward and outward currents were elicited by depolarization. Inward current transients were identified as calcium currents. A portion of the outward current appears to be due to Ca2+-activated K channels commonly expressed in these cells. ICC were also spontaneously active, generating electrical depolarizations similar in waveform to slow-wave events of intact colonic muscles. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ICC initiate rhythmicity in the colon.\r"

Amiloride-inhibitable 22Na flux could be measured in intact oocytes 2-3 days after injection with 25 ng of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from aldosterone-treated A6 cells. The rate of 22Na uptake was approximately 15-fold greater in oocytes microinjected with 25 ng of poly(A)+ RNA than in water-injected control oocytes. An increase in 22Na uptake by mRNA-injected oocytes occurred whether the mRNA was isolated from A6 cells grown on a porous or nonporous support. In the presence of 4 mM NaCl, amiloride caused dose-dependent inhibition of 22Na uptake in mRNA-injected oocytes, which was half-maximal at 6 x 10(-8) M. Both 1 microM amiloride and 0.1 microM benzamil inhibited 22Na uptake in mRNA-injected oocytes by greater than 95%, whereas less than 50% inhibition occurred with 1 microM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride. When A6 cell mRNA was size fractionated by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation, amiloride-sensitive 22Na uptake was expressed predominantly by oocytes injected with mRNA from two contiguous fractions.\r"

Intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater measurements ranged from .58 to .89 and from .74 to .99, respectively. The results of this study indicate that ankle and foot measurements common to a diabetic evaluation can be taken reliably between testers.

The purpose of this study was to critically analyze the maximal voluntary knee torque, motor unit activity, range of motion, and gait sequelae in a series of 95 patients who had tourniquet-aided meniscectomy or intra-articular loose-body removal. Prior to arthrotomy, affected and contralateral knee data differed minimally. In the first days following arthrotomy, the patients invariably demonstrated severe gait and muscle mechanical impairments, with grossly abnormal quadriceps femoris muscle motor unit activity. Of 32 patients consenting to one-month postoperative diagnostic electromyographic and nerve conduction velocity testing, 17 (53%) were found to have femoral neuropathies, with 8 of the 17 having other thigh and leg neuropathies as well. Patients with neuropathy recovered more slowly and scored significantly lower on functional and electrophysiological measures than patients without neuropathy. One month postarthrotomy, knee extensor torques, motor unit activity, and gait scores averaged about half the normal values, and knee flexion torques and ROM were about 75% of normal. Isokinetic device measurements were moderately related to other clinical measures of postarthrotomy outcome (.58 less than r less than .80). Knee torque measurements alone do not adequately characterize functional capacity.\r"

The right Achilles tendons of 18 rabbits were tenotomized, sutured, and immobilized. On each of postoperative days 5, 7, 12, 15, 18, and 21, the right Achilles tendons of three experimental rabbits were excised and processed for electron microscopy. To compare these tendons to normal tendons, the Achilles tendons of three control rabbits were excised bilaterally without prior tenotomy and processed for electron microscopy. Electron micrographs thus obtained revealed 1) an initial period of inflammation lasting at least five days, 2) a subsequent period of fibroplasia and fibrillogenesis, and 3) a third period of progressive alignment and organization of the collagen fibrils into bundles that were oriented in the longitudinal axis of the tendon. Although healing in rabbits may not translate directly to healing in humans, the findings of this study indicate that healing begins soon after tenotomy and that the regenerating Achilles tendon undergoes different stages of healing. Because each stage entails a different set of ultrastructural events, therapeutic interventions should be modified to address the specific events of each stage.\r"

Although many of the factors that influence the incidence of noncompliance have been studied, important ethical concerns are often overlooked. This fact has led many health care professionals to make the following assumptions: 1) All cases of noncompliance are problems in need of a solution, 2) the solution to the problem of noncompliance is compliance, 3) all instances of compliance are nonproblematical, and 4) the locus of the problem of noncompliance is the patient. In this article, the issue of patient noncompliance is examined based on an analysis of the moral foundations of informed consent. The above assumptions are shown to be problematic from the moral point of view. Three patient cases are presented to highlight some of the implications for physical therapists who encounter noncompliant patients. Understanding the moral foundation of informed consent can help guide therapists in their communication with all patients, and especially in their interactions with noncompliant patients.\r"

Subjects were 15 low-risk and 8 high-risk infants with Bayley Scales of Infant Development Motor Scale scores at 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 months. All high-risk and most low-risk infants also had outcome scores at either 24 or 36 months. For the group as a whole, and for all infants with \"normal\" outcomes, subjects did not change ranks over the six test ages (ie, high-scoring infants' ranks remained high and low-scoring infants' ranks remained low), but scores varied significantly from test to test. Scores of infants with \"non-normal\" outcomes did not vary significantly from test to test. The highest and lowest scores of 75% of the infants with normal outcomes and 57% of the infants with non-normal outcomes differed significantly. Four patterns of variations of Bayley Motor Scale scores over the five test ages of the first year after birth were identified. The first pattern included three infants with the most stable scores. The three remaining patterns were different from each other, but a consistent feature of each was a peak at 4 months. Finally, scores at 3 and 8 months were best able to correctly identify outcome. A single Bayley Motor Scale score may not reflect an infant's true abilities; some factor may be inflating scores at age 4 months.\r"

The CAF hardware and software permitted immediate visual feedback of performance relative to the desired target with auditory reinforcement if the target was reached in the desired phase of the gait cycle. The objective of the treatment was to increase knee flexion during push-off and pull-off. After four weekly treatments, the patient's gait velocity and stride length, in addition to transfers between kinetic energy and potential energy, were significantly improved. The patient demonstrated a downward trend in total mechanical energy costs and an upward trend in the amount of energy conservation, as well as increased knee flexion. These promising results indicate a need for further research into the use of CAF as a tool in motor learning for rehabilitation.\r"

Salvage reconstruction with a second jejunum was successful in six of nine patients and one third-time jejunum was successful, giving an overall salvage rate of 70 percent. There were 33 patients experiencing pharyngocutaneous fistulas, 20 of whom had been previously irradiated. Of these patients, 15 experienced spontaneous closure and 9 others had successful surgical correction. The mortality rate was 5 percent. Eighty-three percent of patients were restored to adequate per oral alimentation. The jejunum, despite its relatively high complication rate, is an excellent method for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction, expeditiously providing return to function for patients with late-stage disease.\r"

  ".U": "89387460\r", 
  ".W": "The medial approach to submuscular augmentation mammaplasty under local anesthesia begins with a medial periareolar incision around one-half or more of the areola. A subcutaneous tunnel is made toward the medial breast border, avoiding mammary ducts and sensory nerves to the nipple. The breast is reflected laterally, exposing a patch of pectoralis major muscle. A submuscular pocket is then created beneath portions of the pectoralis major, rectus abdominis, external oblique abdominis, and serratus anterior muscles, after which the implant is inserted and the muscle, dermis, and skin are closed sequentially. The periareolar incision allows for favorable scars without compromising the access or exposure necessary for accurate implant placement. Complete muscle coverage of the implant should contribute to a lower rate of capsular contracture. With a medial submuscular approach, nipple sensation is rarely altered, and revisions, if necessary, can be done through the same incision, still under local anesthesia, for increased safety, economy, and convenience. The medial approach to breast augmentation is a highly versatile, safe, and consistent method of achieving excellent results in breast augmentation in terms of scar, symmetry, and softness.\r"

The second generation of tissue-expanding prostheses is the permanent reverse double-lumen expander. In a series of 100 breast reconstructions using a permanent tissue expander, the clinical benefits of producing a moderate degree of mound ptosis along with observed reduction in pain during expansion are discussed. Additional advantages to the use of the device are the cost savings realized, elimination of a second procedure and a second anesthetic exposure, and a high degree of patient acceptance and satisfaction. This study includes breast reconstruction following mastectomies for malignant and premalignant disease, as demonstrated in 75 delayed and 25 immediate reconstructions, with the longest follow-up being 3 years. Complications of infection (3 percent), significant capsular contracture (4 percent), and implant failure (3 percent) are the most frequent and major complications observed yet. In no instance was breast reconstruction rendered unachievable in the face of these complications. The demonstrated results achieved with permanent tissue-expanding prosthesis, complemented by the obvious benefits and a low rate of significant complications, endorse this method as a viable alternative approach in reconstructive breast surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue expansion has achieved a prominent role in soft-tissue reconstruction. Expansion-induced pain is often a limiting factor in this process and can affect patients for as long as 24 to 48 hours following each expansion session. Although lidocaine is known to be an effective analgesic, only anecdotal reports of its usefulness when placed within a tissue expander currently exist. This two-part study was designed first to determine if in fact silicone is readily permeable to lidocaine, and second to determine if the potential diffusion dynamics can be defined. In part 1 of the study, the silicone polymer was indeed found to be readily permeable to lidocaine as measured with fluorescence immunoassay technique. In part 2, two groups of Surgitek and Dow Corning expanders were filled with saline and lidocaine and placed in saline baths. At several intervals over a 48-hour period, aliquots of the surrounding saline were sampled and the lidocaine levels subsequently determined. A rather predictable and consistent diffusion curve was demonstrated. The significant difference in diffusion characteristics between the two expander types was apparently due to wall thickness differences inherent in the manufacturing. In this in vitro study, filler-valve leakage did not significantly contribute to lidocaine migration from within these tissue expanders. This basic in vitro work will now set the stage for further in vivo and clinical investigations to more precisely define the role of lidocaine in the tissue-expansion process.\r"

There are multiple factors that lead to varying drug levels. These include drug concentration, speed of injection, rate of degradation, total dosage, site of injection or application, rate of administration, and the adjunctive use of vasoconstrictors. This study evaluates the use of subcutaneously injected lidocaine in patients undergoing suction-assisted lipectomy and augmentation mammaplasty. Lidocaine in the concentration of 0.5% containing either 1:100,000 or 1:200,000 epinephrine was used in doses up to 500 mg. Serial lidocaine levels were then obtained up to 1 1/2 hours after injection utilizing two different assay techniques. Our findings demonstrate consistently nondectable serum lidocaine levels despite the use of doses in excess of recommended \"safe\" amounts. This suggests that under specific circumstances and with certain operative procedures, lidocaine dosing can be liberalized.\r"

Nine-hundred and thirty-five members responded, for a response rate of 34.7 percent. The purpose of the survey was to ascertain the total number of major liposuction, dermatolipectomy, and abdominoplasty procedures performed from January of 1984 to January of 1988 and to compare nine specific complications that are associated with these three procedures. The 935 surgeons reported a total of 112,756 procedures performed: major liposuction (75,591), dermatolipectomy (10,603), and abdominoplasty (26,562). Nine major complications were surveyed: mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, pulmonary thromboembolism, fat embolism, major skin loss, anesthesia complication, transfusion complications, and deep venous thrombosis. The findings in this survey showed, when comparing these three procedures and the nine types of complications, that the complication rate for major suction lipectomy was 0.1 percent, for dermatolipectomy 0.9 percent, and for abdominoplasty 2.0 percent. Fat emboli did not prove to be a significant factor associated with any of the three procedures. However, of the 15 reported deaths (major liposuction 2, dermatolipectomy 2, and abdominoplasty 11), pulmonary thromboembolism was the causative factor in 9 deaths (60 percent). Based on these analyzed data, we feel that major suction lipectomy has a low complication rate and is a reasonably safe procedure.\r"

All flaps are designed so that their vascular pedicles are out of the field of injury. After thorough debridement, large, deep wounds are closed with two layers of muscle, while smaller, more superficial wounds are reconstructed with one layer. The trapezius muscle is utilized in the high thoracic area for the deep wound layer, while the paraspinous muscle is used for this layer in the thoracic and lumbar regions. Superficial layer and small wounds in the high thoracic area are reconstructed with either latissimus dorsi or trapezius muscle. Corresponding wounds in the thoracic and lumbar areas are closed with latissimus dorsi muscle alone or in combination with gluteus maximus muscle. The rationale for systematic regionalized reconstruction of acquired midline back wounds is described.\r"

The evolution of digital reconstruction with toe transfer has enabled surgeons to reestablish prehension in these severely injured hands. A 4-year experience with 26 consecutive combined second and third toe transfers to replace missing adjacent fingers was reviewed in order to delineate the indications and technical considerations and to emphasize prevention of donor-site complications. Combined second and third toe transfer is reserved for adjacent finger amputations proximal to the digital web space with remaining fingers no longer than the small finger. Radial amputations are replaced with contralateral combined toe units, while ipsilateral toes are more ideal for ulnar amputations. Limited dorsal and plantar skin flaps extending only to the midpoint of the first and third digital web spaces allow for direct donor-site closure and uncomplicated healing. Maintenance of the plantar metatarsal arch by avoiding metatarsal shaft osteotomies or bone grafting-shortened metatarsals eliminates potential gait disturbances. When properly applied in selected patients, this single-stage microsurgical procedure can restore prehensile function, improve the appearance of the hand with multiple digital amputations, and preserve near-normal donor-foot function.\r"

The first 16 of the authors' 29 patients have been reviewed with an analysis of their appearance.

Individual T2-weighted transverse MR images were acquired in as little as 40 msec on a whole-body system operating at 2.0 T. Clinical evaluation was undertaken with fat-suppressed images in which only protons of water molecules contributed to image signal intensity. The ultrafast MR images were compared with conventional MR images obtained at 0.6 T. In 22 patients and two healthy volunteers, ultrafast MR images were of diagnostic quality and free of motion artifacts. Images obtained at an echo time (TE) of 30 msec (imaging time, 40 msec) had liver signal-to-noise ratios of 56.3 +/- 22.6 (n = 19). Because of a smaller data matrix, ultrafast MR images had soft-tissue interfaces that were less sharp than those of the highest-quality conventional MR images in which no motion artifacts were present. However, ultrafast MR images demonstrated high T2-dependent soft-tissue contrast, and pathologic and normal anatomies were readily detected with both imaging techniques. This ultrafast imaging technique has significant promise in whole-body MR imaging, in which motion artifacts often degrade image quality.\r"

In vitro CT and MR images were obtained of gallstones removed at surgery from 40 and 30 patients, respectively. The patterns of the gallstones seen on CT scans were categorized as dense, moderately dense, faint, isodense, rimmed, and laminated. Gallstones were categorized by maximal signal intensities seen on T1-weighted MR images. After imaging, gallstones underwent in vitro MTBE dissolution. CT appearances correlated well with dissolution rates. Greatest weight change was noted in gallstones with homogeneously faint and isodense patterns, and least weight change was seen in stones with a homogeneously dense pattern. Rimmed and laminated stones with foci of high attenuation dissolved significantly to 5% or less of the original weight, a finding indicating that such foci do not preclude dissolution. Dissolution rates correlated with attenuation values of homogeneous stones (r = .8) and of the rim portion of rimmed stones (r = .8). No correlation was found between T1-weighted signal intensities on MR images and MTBE dissolution rates.\r"

AHNs were divided into two histologic groups: those without atypia (n = 5) and those with atypical hepatocytes or malignant foci (n = 2). All AHNs without atypia were hyperintense on T1-weighted spin-echo images and hypointense on T2-weighted spin-echo images relative to the surrounding liver. However, almost all hepatocellular carcinomas, except for two lesions with massive coagulation necrosis, were demonstrated as hyperintense on T2-weighted images. MR imaging may be useful in the differentiation of AHN without atypia from hepatocellular carcinoma in the cirrhotic liver.\r"

  ".W": "A study of anorectal function during fluoroscopically monitored defecation was conducted in 32 asymptomatic subjects. Two observers independently measured various parameters on defecograms and reviewed video recordings during the subjects' squeezing, rest, and straining. There was a wide range of measurements for the anorectal angle, the position of the anorectal junction, perineal motility, and anal canal width. Interobserver variation of these measurements was large. In 17 subjects, both observers agreed that rectal emptying was incomplete. In 10 patients, there was agreement on the presence of rectal wall changes such as intussusception, rectocele, and mucosal prolapse. Defecographic measurements should be interpreted with caution and should not be used as the only criteria for treatment. Anatomic changes of the anorectal region during straining at defecation do not necessarily cause symptoms but may be a precursor of clinical disorders. Defecography is useful in the detection of these abnormalities.\r"

In 51 patients with suspected bowel or mesenteric injury following blunt abdominal trauma, CT correctly depicted bowel hematoma or mesenteric injury in 17 of 19 nonoperable patients (89%) and severe injuries in one patient who died preoperatively. In 26 of 28 patients who underwent therapeutic laparotomy (93%), initial CT enabled identification of surgically confirmed injuries. In two cases, initial scan misinterpretation delayed diagnosis of serious bowel injuries. The correct interpretation was rendered preoperatively and at blind retrospective review. CT findings that correlated with bowel or mesenteric injury requiring surgery were free peritoneal fluid (27 of 28, 96%), mesenteric infiltration (24 of 28, 86%), thick-walled bowel (17 of 28, 61%), associated abdominal injuries (12 of 28, 43%), and free air (nine of 28, 32%). In nonoperable cases, CT scans demonstrated bowel thickening (84%) but less frequently peritoneal fluid (21%), mesenteric infiltration (26%), or associated injuries (5%). In three of four patients who underwent nontherapeutic laparotomy, preoperative CT correctly imaged the limited abdominal injuries.\r"

In gamma camera images, all thrombi were evident by 2-4 hours after injection. Mean thrombus-to-blood and thrombus-to-muscle ratios averaged 4.0 and 69 at four hours after injection and increased to 24 and 270, respectively, by 24 hours after injection. When compared with I-125 fibrinogen injected into the same dogs, Tc-99m-antifibrin Fab' had lower absolute uptake in thrombus but higher thrombus-to-blood ratios due to a faster rate of disappearance from the blood. The primary route of excretion was through the kidneys. Tc-99m-antifibrin Fab' was highly stable in vivo, with an average of 82% of the circulating radioactivity able to bind to fibrin at 4 hours after injection. When compared with an In-111-labeled Fab fragment of antifibrin antibody 59D8, thrombus-to-blood and thrombus-to-muscle ratios were slightly higher for the Tc-99m-labeled antibody, and the blood disappearance rate was slightly faster. The absolute uptake in thrombus, however, was not significantly different, and the thrombus was visualized at about the same time after injection. These studies suggest that Tc-99m T2G1s Fab' is a potential agent for detecting thrombi in a clinical setting.\r"

These patients were indistinguishable radiographically from patients with typical seronegative disorders except for the predominance of lower-extremity abnormalities. Four patients (17%) had a rheumatoidlike arthritis defined as acute symmetric polyarthritis (ASP). With the exception of extensive proliferative periostitis, ASP simulated classic rheumatoid arthritis. HIV-associated arthritis was manifest during various stages of HIV infection. It preceded acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in 64% of patients with stage IV HIV infection. Awareness of the coexistence of HIV infection in patients with the above-mentioned arthritides is important, since immunosuppressive therapy, commonly used in the treatment of arthritis, can have detrimental effects in patients with HIV infection.\r"

The lateral radiographs were examined of all patients at the authors' institution who demonstrated an abnormal odontoid process or an abnormal anterior arch of C-1. Six patients were found: Four had os odontoideum, one had rheumatoid arthritis, and one had a congenital defect in the posterior arch of C-1. All had hypertrophy of the C-1 anterior arch on the lateral view. The width of the anterior arch of C-1 and the cortical thickness of the anterior arch in these six patients were measured and compared with the findings in a control group of 20 patients; the measurements from the six patients were found to be significantly greater. Hypertrophy of the anterior arch of C-1 is a useful sign of a chronic pathologic condition at the atlantoaxial articulation, and in the setting of acute trauma it may be an important clue that prevents unnecessary invasive treatment for a mistaken diagnosis of fractured dens.\r"

High signal intensity was observed within the spinal cord on T2-weighted or proton density spin-echo images in 99 patients (14.8%). Frequency of this finding was directly proportional to severity of clinical myelopathy and degree of spinal canal compression seen on MR images. Patients with a high-signal-intensity area responded less favorably than those without to surgical or medical treatment. More than 60% of the patients had this finding when grade of myelopathy or degree of canal compression was moderate to marked. Among 10 patients who received contrast material during MR imaging, one patient had definite enhancement and another had questionable enhancement in the high-signal-intensity area. The finding disappeared after decompressive surgery and medical treatment in some cases: Three of four of the patients who underwent surgery showed good clinical improvement. High signal intensity of the spinal cord produced by compressive lesions appears to be an important indicator for predicting prognosis.\r"

CT findings of bullous damage included bullae or cystic spaces, areas of low attenuation, and vascular disruption. A visual scoring system was used to grade CT scans according to the percentage of lung demonstrating bullous change. Of the 23 AIDS patients with CT evidence of pulmonary bullous damage, 16 (70%) had one or more documented pulmonary infections, while three (13%) had no prior history of lung infection (P less than .05). Spontaneous pneumothorax was a complication of pulmonary bullous damage in three patients.

Specific criteria were provided to the readers to define objectively when contrast material enhancement (or lack thereof) would be considered \"radiologically helpful.\" Contrast-enhancing lesions were observed in 99 cases (20%). In only 15 cases (3%) did Gd-DTPA permit detection of lesions not also apparent on the precontrast studies. Contrast enhancement was considered radiologically helpful in 74 of the 99 cases. Lack of enhancement was considered helpful in 112 of the 500 cases (22%). Factors that may indicate increased usefulness of Gd-DTPA include increased patient age, definite lesion seen at computed tomography or precontrast MR imaging, prior craniotomy for tumor, and clinically documented systemic or central nervous system disease. Gd-DTPA should probably be used routinely for cranial MR imaging in most patients, except, perhaps, children and young adults with normal precontrast images.\r"

Velocity-dependent phase images were used to quantify flow rates within the shunt. A preliminary study was performed in seven patients with hydrocephalus and cerebrospinal fluid shunts. Two patients were found to have zero flow in the shunt, while the remaining five had flow rates ranging from 4 to 19 mL/h.

A set of algorithms that can reverse the effects of object displacements and phase shifts was used. These algorithms essentially transfer the frame of reference of the image reconstruction from the static frame of the imager couch to the moving \"visceral frame.\" An accurate record of tissue motion during image acquisition is required. To achieve this, the authors used specially encoded \"navigator\" echoes that are interleaved with the imaging sequence. Postprocessing of the navigator echo data provides a highly detailed record of the displacements and phase shifts that occur during imaging. Phantom studies demonstrated that the technique can directly correct image degradation caused by motion. In contrast to conventional artifact reduction techniques, such as ordered phase encoding and gradient moment nulling, this new method has a unique capacity to reduce motion unsharpness. Preliminary in vivo studies have demonstrated that the technique can markedly improve images degraded by voluntary motion and shows promise for addressing the problem of respiratory motion in thoracoabdominal imaging.\r"

Transarterial portography with digital subtraction angiography was performed in the RACCO and posteroanterior (PA) views in 22 patients. Comparison of the two views revealed that the RACCO view was superior to the PA view of the left main branch in 15 patients (68%) and of the right posterior lobe branch in 19 patients (86%). The RACCO view will be useful for the evaluation of the portal system in patients with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasms in whom detailed images are important for diagnosis treatment planning.\r"

Although in most circumstances in this relatively small subset of patients CT was not helpful in differentiating masses with and without mediastinal invasion, CT was able to separate a large group of masses that were likely to be technically resectable. Thirty-six (97%) of 37 masses with one or more of these CT findings were considered technically resectable: contact of 3 cm or less with mediastinum, less than 90 degrees of contact with aorta, and mediastinal fat between mass and mediastinal structures. Of these 36 masses, 28 were resectable without mediastinal invasion, and eight were resectable with focal limited mediastinal invasion.\r"

The authors examined sections from eight cadavers and 80 chest CT examinations to more clearly delineate the pulmonary ligament from this second structure. Anatomic and CT correlation proves that the line seen at the midportion of the inferior vena cava represents the right phrenic nerve and that the right pulmonary ligament is located posterior to it.\r"

Hot spots were present in the scans of 13 patients and usually occupied less than one pulmonary segment. Most hot spots were detected within a region of atelectasis identified on chest radiographs (38%). A substantial number of the remaining hot spots were located in the lung adjacent to regions of embolus. In patients with massive embolus, hot spots actually represented normally preserved perfusion in the presence of globally reduced perfusion elsewhere.\r"

To evaluate the effectiveness of the project, a telephone survey of 58 facilities was conducted six times over 2 1/2 years, beginning January 1986 and at 6-month intervals thereafter. The number of facilities offering lower fees for screening than for consultative mammography increased from two with a mean fee of $50.00 in January 1986 to 16 with a mean fee of $68.71 in July 1988. The trend for differentiating screening and consultative examination fees occurred at both hospital- and office-based practices, but fees were significantly lower in the office-based practices. There was also a statistically significant increase in the number of facilities accepting self-referred patients between January 1986 (15.5% of facilities) and July 1988 (34.5%). At the time of the last survey, 60% of office-based practices were accepting self-referred patients.\r"

Radiation dose reductions of approximately 30% for Ortho M film and 13% for T-Mat M II film were achieved with the extended-cycle process. In the mammogram comparisons, higher-contrast images were obtained with Ortho M film in the extended-cycle process, which allowed for improved demonstration of marginal structural characteristics of soft-tissue masses and better differentiation of benign and malignant tumors. No significant differences in contrast were observed in the T-Mat M II mammograms obtained with the extended-cycle process.\r"

The analysis incorporates the performance characteristics of chest radiography, the natural history of the disease process, and therapeutic efficacy as a function of earliness of detection in the determination of optimal strategy. Examples of the model applied to the experiences of Stanford Medical Center and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital illustrate the utility of such a model in customizing an optimal monitoring strategy for a specific institution and clinical experience. The results suggest that monitoring protocols significantly overutilize chest radiography in the evaluation for recurrent Hodgkin disease in children.\r"

The initial appearance of these cystic lung lesions on the chest radiograph is generally benign.

In general, the tumors were of intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of either intermediate or increased signal intensity (T2 lengthening) with T2 weighting. All demonstrated variable areas of internal signal void interpreted as signifying regional blood flow, calcification, or old hemorrhage. CT findings included relatively uniform contrast enhancement. Microscopic pathologic changes of the benign lesions mimicked the appearance of normal choroid plexus and confirmed the highly vascular nature of these tumors. MR imaging, with its high-resolution multiplanar techniques, offers direct visualization of these lesions in relation to normal anatomy and better discrimination and confirmation of their intraventricular location, facilitating surgery and postoperative follow-up.\r"

In tangential cells of crayfish optic lobes, a hyperpolarizing, biphasic synaptic potential is produced by the concurrent action of acetylcholine and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Acetylcholine hyperpolarizes the cell and increases chlorine conductance. GABA depolarizes the cell by closing some of the same chloride channels. Therefore, in this case integration is achieved by the antagonistic actions of two transmitters on the same ionic channel.\r"

All 30 sera also immunoprecipitated the nucleolar Th RNP, indicating that the two RNPs are structurally related. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Th RNP revealed it was identical to the RNA component of the mitochondrial RNA processing enzyme known as RNase MRP. Antibodies that immunoprecipitated the Th RNP selectively depleted murine and human cell extracts of RNase MRP activity, indicating that the Th and RNase MRP RNPs are identical. Since RNase P and RNase MRP are not associated with each other during biochemical purification, we suggest that these two RNA processing enzymes share a common autoantigenic polypeptide.\r"

However, after simultaneous high-frequency stimulation of both the sensory cortex and the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, LTP of thalamic input to motor cortical neurons is induced. This associative LTP occurs only in neurons in the superficial layers of the motor cortex that receive monosynaptic input from both the sensory cortex and the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Associative LTP in the motor cortex may constitute a basis for the retention of motor skills.\r"

However, this interaction may not occur at the cell surface as predicted by the autocrine hypothesis because phenotypic transformation was not reversed by incubation of SSV-NRK cells with antisera to PDGF and because morphological transformation did not occur when nontransformed NRK cells were cultured continuously with p28v-sis. A mutant of the wild-type v-sis gene was constructed that encodes a v-sis protein targeted for retention within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. NRK cells expressing the mutant v-sis gene did not secrete any detectable v-sis protein but were as fully transformed as wild-type v-sis transfectants. The results support a mechanism of transformation by v-sis in which internal activation of the PDGF receptor occurs before expression of either p28v-sis or the PDGF receptor at the cell surface.\r"

Several of the class of proteins anchored in the membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) are expressed on the apical surface of such cells. However, it is not known whether the mechanism of membrane anchorage or the polypeptide sequence provides the sorting information. The conversion of the normally basolateral vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) to a GPI-anchored protein led to its apical expression. Conversely, replacement of the GPI anchor of placental alkaline phosphatase with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of VSV G shifted its expression from the apical to the basolateral surface. Thus, the mechanism of membrane anchorage can determine the sorting of proteins to the apical or basolateral surface, and the GPI anchor itself may provide an apical transport signal.\r"

By intracellular recording, CA1 neurons in slices from adrenalectomized rats have been found to display a markedly reduced afterhyperpolarization (that is, the hyperpolarizing phase after a brief depolarizing current pulse) when compared with their sham controls. No differences were found for other tested membrane properties. Brief exposure of hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized rats to glucocorticoid agonists, 30 to 90 minutes before recording, greatly enhanced the afterhyperpolarization. In addition, glucocorticoids attenuated the norepinephrine-induced blockade of action potential accommodation in CA1 neurons. The findings indicate that glucocorticoids can reduce transmitter-evoked excitability in the hippocampus, presumably via a receptor-mediated genomic action.\r"

In the present studies, adrenal steroids have been shown to modulate a well-defined membrane conductance in hippocampal pyramidal cells. The calcium-dependent slow afterhyperpolarization is reduced in hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized rats, and it is increased after in vivo or in vitro administration of the adrenal steroid, corticosterone. Calcium action potentials are also reduced in adrenalectomized animals, indicating that the primary effect of corticosteroids may be on calcium conductance. The afterhyperpolarization component reduced by adrenalectomy is greater in aged rats than in young rats, suggesting that, with aging, there is an increased effect of corticosteroids on some calcium-mediated brain processes. Because elevated concentrations of intracellular calcium can be cytotoxic, these observations may increase the understanding of glucocorticoid involvement in brain aging as well as of the normal functions of these steroids in the brain.\r"

The development of potent and selective antagonists for CCK-A (MK-329) and CCK-B (L-365,260) receptors now allows these issues to be addressed. The CCK-A antagonist MK-329 and the CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 increased food intake in partially satiated rats and postponed the onset of satiety; however, L-365,260 was 100 times more potent than MK-329 in increasing feeding and preventing satiety.

This predisposition to develop self-administration can be induced by repeated treatment with amphetamine.

  ".W": "This study evaluated the effect of angled insertion of halo pins on the biomechanical characteristics of the halo pin-calvarium complex. Halo pins were inserted into isolated calvarium sections at 90 degrees, 75 degrees, and 60 degrees to the surface of the bone at an insertional torque of 0.68 N-m (6 inch-pounds). Initial rigidity, load at failure, and deformation at failure of the pin-bone complex were assessed during transverse shear loading. The structural properties of the pin-bone complex were maximized at loads approaching failure when pins were inserted perpendicular (90 degrees) to the bony surface and significantly decreased at more acute angles of insertion. Perpendicular insertion of halo pins maximizes the structural properties of the complex formed by the halo pin and the calvarium. This improved structural behavior may minimize the incidence of pin loosening clinically, and may reduce the frequency of other complications currently associated with the use of the halo orthosis.\r"

The incidence of accumulation in the spine was 25.0% in breast cancer, 29.5% in lung cancer, 24.3% in cervical cancer, and 47.0% in prostatic cancer. The predominant location of the accumulation was the lumbar vertebra (68.9%), followed by the thoracic vertebra (45.0%), sacral vertebra (37.5%), and cervical vertebra (23.6%). The survivability after spinal accumulation was determined by the Kaplan-Meyer survival curve. The 1-year survival rate of breast cancer, pulmonary cancer, cervical cancer, and prostatic cancer was 88%, 19%, 74%, and 90%, respectively, the record of pulmonary cancer being significantly lower. Hence, in the treatment of patients with metastatic spinal tumors, the therapeutic method should be selected according to the underlying disease.\r"

In many cases, it is likely that this variability severely limits the reliability and usefulness of spinal cord monitoring in detecting early cord compromise. Patients with idiopathic scoliosis, spondylolisthesis, and pseudarthrosis have the smallest spontaneous variability and strongest amplitudes, while those with congenital, paralytic scoliosis, stenosis, or tumor have very variable, weak SCEPs. Patients with neurologic disorders, particularly cerebral palsy, myelomeningocele, Friedreich's ataxia, and peripheral deficits, also have high variability and weak amplitudes. A monitoring quality scoring system is proposed that may be useful during surgery in judging how well the SCEPs can discern surgically related changes in cord function from background variations.\r"

Although the fractures were markedly unstable, nonoperative treatment was uniformly successful in achieving union. The incidence of complications and mortality in this group was significantly lower than that reported in other studies, and the authors attribute this to conservative management within a spinal cord injury unit.\r"

All patients had significant neurologic deficits, with 23 patients suffering a complete neurologic injury. Average clinical follow-up was 18 months (range: 4-64 months). Only three patients developed documented spinal or paraspinal infections. One case of acute meningitis occurred after an isolated stomach perforation, while two other patients developed psoas abscesses after colon injuries. The roles of initial antibiotic therapy and of early bullet removal were evaluated in regard to infection. An extended course of broad spectrum antibiotics combined with bedrest appeared to significantly reduce the risk of spinal or paraspinal infection as compared with a previous study. Early bullet removal did not appear to be a significant factor in the prevention of infection. Prospective studies are needed to accurately delineate the role of initial antibiotic therapy for the prevention of spinal infection in these injuries.\r"

Fourty-five normal men and women (20-40 years of age) completed the study. The KIN/COM trunk testing unit (Chattecx Corporation, Chattanooga, Tennessee) was used for both testing and training. The results of the study follow: 1) The KIN/COM trunk testing system was very accurate, and the method used was highly reproducible for the kinetic variables. Reproducibility for the endurance variables was mixed, and isolated EMG variables were poor. 2) Kinetic and EMG decrements associated with fatigue did occur in the trunk muscles with ten continuous cycles of maximal concentric and eccentric contractions. 3) Trunk muscle strength gains were highest for the same mode of exercise used in training (specificity), but significant strength gains also were seen in different modes of muscle contraction (transfer of training). For the trunk extensors, the eccentric form of exercise was superior. 4) The rate of isometric torque development and decay was increased by exercise in men. 5) Trunk muscle endurance was retained when gains in strength occurred. 6) The majority of variables reflecting strength and endurance were retained. The methods and results can serve as guidelines for the evaluation of trunk muscle function and resistive exercise in the clinic.\r"

Nine of these experienced pain reduction or alleviation. Resection of the transverse process was performed in all cases. At follow-up, at 6 to 42 months postoperatively, seven patients reported total alleviation of pain, and two, significant improvement. Two patients had unchanged symptoms; one patient was 76 years of age, had associated degenerative changes of the spine, and had no effect of local anesthetics in his joint, and the other was a 13-year-old male competitive swimmer. The authors conclude that, in patients with anomalous unilateral lumbosacral articulations and low-back pain, in whom local anesthesia into the joint gives pain alleviation, resection of the transverse process may be a worthwhile procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in nerve root compression forces with spinal motion were measured on six freshly frozen adult cadaver spine specimens. A model was devised to represent a herniated disc at the L4-5 level. This was done using an anterior approach placing a compression-measuring device through the disc at the L4-5 level and against the L5 root. An accelerometer was used to monitor the range of motion of the spine. Because the compression device was held in a static position, the only variable was the tautness of the nerve root across the tip of the device. By simultaneously monitoring motion and force delivered at the tip of the compression meter placed at the nerve root, we were able to quantitate nerve root tension forces across the tip of the measuring device in relation to spinal motion. The force was measured with controls as well as in flexion and extension. In addition, the force was measured as traction was applied to the L5 root. The amount of compressive force and tension in the nerve root increased with flexion of the spine and decreased with extension of the spine. In conclusion, flexion of the lumbar spine increased the compressive force on the L5 root and extension decreased the compressive force on the L5 root.\r"

Patients with the worst outcomes in terms of poor work role adjustment and severe pain complaints were more likely to be immigrants from mainland China, to be engaged in heavy manual labor, to be involved in compensation claims for work-related injuries, manifested a high degree of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and were hostile toward medical personnel. An intermediate group of patients with adequate work role adjustment but severe to moderate levels of pain were characterized by being females with varying combinations of anxiety and depressive symptoms. A preliminary clinical interview guide for screening potential problematic patients was developed.\r"

Both the upper and lower portions of the abdominal muscle were studied during graded increase and decrease of torque. Repeated testing was performed over 6 weeks. The form of the relation between torque and EMG was better described by a quadratic than by a linear regression relationship, but with considerable variability about the best-fit line. The torque-increasing and torque-decreasing parts of each test were different and were analyzed separately. After 6 weeks of repeated testing, maximum voluntary isometric flexion torque increased 16.8% (P less than 0.01). There was a decrease in the ratio of electromyographic activity to torque production, which was statistically significant in the torque-increasing recordings. These changes in maximum torque and in the EMG-torque relation were attributed to learning through a test-retest effect, rather than to a true change in muscle characteristics. These findings, which show changes in normal subjects undergoing repeated testing, do not support the reliability of isometric strength measurements, or measurements based on RMS EMG recordings, for quantifying abdominal muscle function in patients with back pain, or those undergoing strengthening exercises.\r"

It has been postulated that the development of Schmorl's nodes may also lead to anomalies of the vasculature in the end-plates, which may lead to further end-plate lesions. In the present study, we have examined lumbar intervertebral discs and vertebrae from eight specimens with Schmorl's nodes and 12 specimens without nodes. The specimens examined were from individuals ranging in age from 17 to 90 years. The specimens were sectioned at 150 microns, stained, and the percentage of the bone cartilage interface occupied by marrow spaces was measured using a microscope with an ocular micrometer.

At late follow-up, no correlation could be found between the time from the operation and disc space height. One hundred percent of patients developed disc space height decreases during the postoperative period, with 46% of levels being narrower than their preoperative height at last follow-up.

Typically recommended lateral and posterior-anterior radiography is shown here to provide potentially misleading visualization during implantation. To reduce the risk of anterior cortical penetration, presented here are 1) a radiographic method (\"near approach view\") that avoids this problem and allows direct visualization of the relationship between drill bit or screw tip and anterior vertebral cortex, and 2) a surgical technique (\"mallet method\") that provides both an audible and a palpable change when the drill bit contacts the anterior cortex.\r"

We have described delayed presentation in an adult with evidence of the tethered spinal cord syndrome following myelomeningocele repair. This patient's presenting complaints are similar to that of the childhood variety, despite many earlier symptom-free years. Further studies of adults who have had low-level myelomeningocele repair early in life may delineate a more common problem than is realized at present.\r"

  ".U": "89388466\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence to suggest that abnormal coupling patterns in the lumbar spine may be an indicator of low-back problems. To quantify the normal coupling patterns, fresh cadaveric human lumbar spine specimens (L1-S1) were used. A pure axial torque or lateral bending moment of 10 N-m (in five equal steps) was applied to the specimen, in five spinal postures, and three-dimensional motions were measured at the five vertebral levels. The results indicated that the coupling patterns changed significantly with the intervertebral level. For example, in neutral posture, the left axial torque produced coupled lateral bending, which varied from approximately 2 degrees right lateral bending at L1-2, to approximately 0 degrees at L3-4, and to approximately 2.5 degrees left lateral bending at L5-S1. Additionally, there was coupled flexion of approximately 1 degrees to 2 degrees at all levels. Application of left lateral bending moment resulted in approximately 1.7 degrees of coupled right axial rotation at all levels, except at L1-L2, where it was 0 degrees. Additionally, there was coupled flexion of 0.7 degrees to 2 degrees at all levels. For example, at the L2-3 level, the left axial torque produced coupled right lateral bending that ranged from approximately 0.5 degrees at full extension to approximately 2.5 degrees at full flexion. There was also accompanying coupled flexion of approximately 0.4 degrees to 1.7 degrees. Application of left lateral bending moment at the L2-3 level produced axial rotation of approximately 2.5 degrees, which did not vary with the posture, while the other coupled motion varied from approximately 1.7 degrees flexion at full extension posture to approximately 0.8 degrees extension at full flexion posture.\r"

Trabecular bone compressive strength and stiffness increased with increasing bone density, the latter proportional to strength and stiffness to the one-half power. Regional variations within each segment were found, the most prevalent differences occurring in regions of bone overlying the disc nucleus in comparison with bone overlying the disc anulus. For normal discs, the ratio of strength of bone overlying the disc nucleus to bone overlying the disc anulus was 1.25, decreasing to 1.0 for moderately degenerated discs. These results suggest that an interdependency of trabecular bone properties and intervertebral disc properties may exist.\r"

In 70% of discs from patients between 60 and 69 and in 80% of discs from patients over 70, the fragments were composed of the anulus fibrosus and the cartilaginous end-plate. The authors concluded that the cartilaginous end-plate had avulsed from the vertebral body and herniated with the anulus fibrosus in these cases. This type of herniation occurs more often than herniation of the nucleus pulposus over 30, and may be most common in elderly patients because of their advanced disc degeneration.\r"

This study was carried out to assess the ability of cephazolin (a first-generation cephalosporin) to penetrate the intervertebral disc and to establish the role of intravenous antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of iatrogenic discitis. Six sheep had 1 g of intravenous antibiotic administered between 30 minutes and 120 minutes before being killed. Two adjacent lumbar intervertebral discs were harvested and assayed for antibiotic concentration. Cephazolin could only be detected in the animals killed at 30 minutes. Intravenous cephazolin was administered 30 minutes before bacterial inoculation in 46 discs of nine sheep. In five animals, the bacterial suspension contained radiographic contrast and, in four sheep, reconstituted chymopapain. No evidence of discitis was found at any level at death. Eight sheep were treated with intravenous cephazolin commencing 1, 2, or 3 weeks after bacterial intradiscal inoculation and for periods of up to 21 days. All discs developed discitis, and the lesions appeared to be similar, irrespective of time between inoculation and the commencement, duration, and dosage of antibiotic therapy. Our study supports the use of a suitable broad-spectrum antibiotic during any surgical procedure that invades the intervertebral disc. Antibiotics, however, are unable to arrest the progression of discitis once it is established\r"

After an initial anterior and posterior destabilizing lesion was created at the L5-L6 vertebral levels in 42 adult beagles, various spinal reconstructive surgical procedures were performed--with or without bilateral posterolateral bone grafting, and with or without spinal instrumentation (Harrington distraction; Luque rectangular, or Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular methods). After 6 months' postoperative observation, there was a significantly improved probability of achieving a spinal fusion if spinal instrumentation had been used (P = 0.058). Nondestructive mechanical testing after removal of all metal instrumentation in torsion, axial compression, and flexion revealed that the fusions performed in conjunction with spinal instrumentation were more rigid (P less than 0.05). Quantitative histomorphometry showed that the volumetric density of bone was significantly lower (ie, device-related osteoporosis occurred) for fused versus unfused spines; and Harrington- and Cotrel-Dubousset-instrumented dogs became more osteoporotic than the other three groups. The rigidity of spinal instrumentation led to device-related osteoporosis (stress shielding) of the vertebra. However, as the rigidity of spinal instrumentation increased, there was an increased probability of achieving a successful spinal fusion. The improved mechanical properties of spinal instrumentation on spinal arthrodesis more than compensate for the occurrence of device-related osteoporosis in the spine.\r"

  ".W": "A biomechanical model for studying lumbar muscle load sharing for a class of physical tasks that involve gravitational loading (holding weights) of the upper body in an erect posture is presented. The model assumes that the lumbar muscles balance the externally applied flexion and lateral bending moments. The concept of a 'loading plane' whose axes are the two bending moments is introduced. Any point in the plane can be viewed as a 'loading-point' describing a combination of bending moments that are applied to the body. The study of lumbar-muscle load sharing revealed loading conditions that required activation or deactivation of a particular muscle. The loading plane thus could be divided into regions of activity and inactivity for each muscle, separated by a 'switching curve.' The concept of 'switching curves' proved very useful for examining previously described physiologic assumptions on the loading conditions of particular muscle groups, and for grouping the 22 muscles described in the model into ten functional units. Electromyographic validation studies were conducted and showed a high degree of correlation between the model predictions and actual measurements for the contralateral (with respect to the load) muscles and to a lesser degree of correlation for the ipsilateral muscles.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to estimate the discriminatory power of multiple combinations of risk indicators for the occurrence and recurrence of low-back trouble (LBT) in workers. Two categories of LBT provided groups for discrimination; 1) the presence or absence of LBT history, and 2) three patterns of recurrence characterized by the number of episodes (isolated, periodic, chronic). The risk indicators comprised data reflecting occupational and leisure demands on the back, measures of lumbar sagittal mobility, and anamnestic features of the first episode. Discriminant analysis was the statistical procedure used. The results showed that it was possible to find linear combinations of the discriminating variables that successfully allocated around two-thirds of the sample to the correct group. The presence of a history of LBT was predicted by the combined effect of increasing age and adult sports participation, but only in females did a heavier job contribute to such prediction. A reduction in risk was associated with lumbar flexibility and sports participation at school. Chronic LBT was more accurately identified than the two other groups; increasing age, a long initial spell, and an onset early in life were associated with increased likelihood of chronicity, while a report of symptoms being relieved by sitting reduced this risk. It is concluded that the occurrence and recurrence of LBT are related to combinations of risk indicators, and that it is imperative to consider the interactive effect of a multiplicity of factors in epidemiologic studies.\r"

The incidence of reported pain, disability, psychological disturbance, unemployment, and length of time off work was greater in the compensation group (P less than 0.001).

The present study reports the first results from a large-scale investigation of tertiary predictors. Specifically, it addresses the issue of what psychosociomedical variables are predictive of success/failure in response to a comprehensive Functional Restoration treatment program by workers who are chronically disabled with low-back pain. Three stages were involved in the development of this prediction model. First, a group of treatment and research professionals who had extensive experience in the area of chronic low-back pain identified an array of 42 variables, from a larger pool of quantified physical, psychosocial, and medical parameters rated to be important with this patient population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were treated conservatively for 4 weeks before entering the study. Injection therapy was of four different types: lidocaine, lidocaine combined with a steroid, acupuncture, and vapocoolant spray with acupressure. Results indicated that therapy without injected medication (63% improvement rate) was at least as effective as therapy with drug injection (42% improvement rate), at a P value of 0.09. Trigger-point therapy seems to be a useful adjunct in treatment of low-back strain. The injected substance apparently is not the critical factor, since direct mechanical stimulus to the trigger-point seems to give symptomatic relief equal to that of treatment with various types of injected medication.\r"

In two of the 11 patients, this posture significantly improved by more than 100% of both walking and cycling distances. In addition, one patient had claudication pain when he was walking, but could cycle unlimited distance. Only one of the patients with intermittent claudication could walk or cycle further in the flexed position. Although some patients with neurogenic claudication increase their walking distance by flexing forwards, we conclude that posture-related walking and cycling are insufficiently sensitive tests to distinguish between neurogenic and intermittent claudication.\r"

In the literature, two types of lumbar spinous process deviation (SPD) have been described: 1) SPD due to rotation of the entire vertebra (as in rotatory scoliosis and degenerative arthritis), and 2) SPD as a consequence of developmental asymmetries of the neural arch. The present study demonstrates that spinous process deviation in the AP radiograph is not a reliable diagnostic guide. The authors' quantitative morphologic analysis of computed tomographic (CT) sections of over 200 lower lumbar vertebrae in vivo revealed a third type of SPD, namely isolated deviation of the spinous process, ie, deviation without any associated rotation or asymmetry of the vertebral body or arch. Since the oval shadow cast by the spinous process in AP radiographs is caused by its tip, rather than by its base (as was demonstrated by in vitro tests), it is concluded that the position of the spinous process shadow in AP radiographs cannot be used as a reliable landmark to differentiate between the three types of SPD. This is only possible by means of a CT examination.\r"

Such a strong relationship was not observed with transitional vertebrae, spondylolisthesis, spina bifida, or postural abnormalities. However, an increased weight, a positive straight leg raising test, and a reduced lumbar mobility was consistent with an increase in frequency of DD.

Isokinetic extensor trunk strength was independently measured at each session for comparison with myoelectric signal analysis. The investigation revealed significant differences in group statistics between patients in early rehabilitation and their subsequent tests, as well as between their initial test and the normal subject scores. However, test sensitivity for identifying patients with \"low endurance\" is questionable. There was no significant correlation between EMG initial MPF measures and isokinetic extensor trunk strength measures, even though all patients showed isokinetic improvement. Data suggest that the protocol used and myoelectric power spectrum temporal shifts may have some value for identification of individual subjects with endurance limitations (or fatigue resistance) in patients of this type. However, lack of a \"gold standard\" for comparison presents difficulties in documenting the value and validity with respect to endurance. The test may be of value to measure relative loads.\r"

A Back Analysis System for objectively measuring local fatigue in the back extensor muscles is presented. The reliability and validity of this technique was evaluated by testing chronic low-back pain patients and control subjects without back pain. Concurrent surface electromyograms (EMG) were detected from multiple back muscles during sustained isometric contractions at different force levels of trunk extension. Median frequency parameters of the EMG power density spectrum were monitored to quantify localized muscle fatigue. Results indicated: 1) high reliability estimates for repeated trials; 2) significant differences (P less than 0.05) in median frequency parameters between lower back pain patients and control subjects for specific combinations of contractile force level and muscle site tested; 3) Median Frequency parameters correctly classified lower back pain and control subjects using a two-group discriminant analysis procedure. The applicability of this technique as a treatment outcome measure and diagnostic screening method for lower back pain patients is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89388563\r", 
  ".W": "Increased use of the omentum in chest-wall reconstruction has paralleled the refinement of anatomic knowledge and the development of safe mobilization techniques. Important anatomic points are the omental attachments to surrounding structures, the major blood supply from the left and right gastroepiploic vessels, and the collateral circulation via the gastroepiploic arch and Barkow's marginal artery. Mobilization of the omentum to the thorax involves division of its attachments to the transverse colon and separation from the greater curvature to fabricate a bipedicled flap. Most anterior chest wounds and virtually all mediastinal wounds can be covered with the omentum based on both sets of gastroepiploic vessels. The arc of transposition is increased when the omentum is based on a single pedicle, allowing coverage of virtually all chest-wall defects. The final method of increasing flap length involves division of the gastroepiploic arch and reliance on Barkow's marginal artery as collateral circulation to maintain flap viability. With regard to chest-wall reconstruction, we have included the omentum in the armamentarium of flaps used to cover mediastinal wounds. The omentum is our flap of choice for the reconstruction of most radiation injuries of the chest wall. The omentum may also be used to provide protection to visceral anastomoses, vascular conduits, and damaged structures in the chest, as well as to cover defects secondary to tumor excision or trauma. In brief, the omentum has proved to be a most dependable and versatile flap, particularly applicable to chest-wall reconstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Acute arterial embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the runoff vessels is associated with an incomplete operative thromboembolectomy and an unacceptably high rate of amputation. This report presents a six year analysis of the use of intraoperative intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy, evaluating 38 patients who presented with impending loss of limb because of an acute occlusion of the runoff vessels. All of the patients had extensive thrombosis of a distal vessel and a complete distal thromboembolectomy was not possible. Fourteen patients received infusion of streptokinase, maximum dose of 50,000 units; 26 received urokinase (UK), maximum dose of 150,000 units, and two underwent an isolated limb perfusion technique using one million units of UK. Thirty-four lower and four upper extremities were treated. Twenty-eight of 38 patients had successful revascularization procedures that resulted in salvage of the limbs, and ten of the 38 underwent an extensive amputation. In 18 of the 28 who were successfully revascularized, lysis was clearly obtained, which contributed to the ultimate success; in ten of the 28, it was unclear whether or not lysis significantly contributed to salvage of the limbs. Although four of the 38 died within 30 days postoperatively and one patient had a hemorrhagic complication, neither the deaths nor the complication could be attributed to a lytic agent. There was no evidence of systemic thrombolysis in these patients. Intraoperative intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy administered by the slow bolus injection technique is safe. It can be an important adjunct to mechanical thromboembolectomy and bypass procedures in patients with limb-threatening ischemia caused by thrombosis of the distal part of the vessel. The isolated limb perfusion technique using high dose UK is particularly valuable in acute, small vessel, multiarterial occlusion. Intraoperative intra-arterial infusion of thrombolytic agents may make the difference between salvage or amputation of the limb without causing additional risk for the patient.\r"

Among those who had an intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) that fell more than 20 millimeters of mercury below the base line, 15 per cent of those with fall of MAP lasting for greater than or equal to 60 minutes had postoperative renal dysfunction, whereas those with drops in pressure lasting for less than 60 minutes did not sustain increased postoperative renal dysfunction. Patients who had intraoperative MAP rise to greater than 20 millimeters of mercury above the preoperative base line value for greater than 30 minutes also had twice the rate of postoperative renal dysfunction. Fifteen per cent of the patients who received less than 300 milliliters per hour of isotonic saline-like fluids had postoperative renal dysfunction, significantly more than the 8 per cent of those who received greater than or equal to 300 milliliters per hour. Two intraoperative events also significantly increased postoperative renal dysfunction rates: cardiac arrest and the drainage of massive ascites. Patients with decompensated congestive heart failure at admission to the hospital had significantly increased postoperative renal dysfunction; these patients and probably should not undergo an operation unless it is an emergency. All of the patients, regardless of the magnitude of the operation and of its projected length or type of anesthesia, should be given greater than 300 milliliters per hour of isotonic saline-like solutions.\r"

Nine pigs underwent hepatectomy without pretreatment, while six were given 2 milligrams per kilogram of Dibenzyline prior to hepatic dissection. Hepatic arterial blood flow was monitored with an electromagnetic flow probe, and after cardiac arrest, arteriograms of the hepatic circulation were obtained. Hepatic arterial vasospasm occurred in seven of the pigs in group 1 and in only one of group 2 (p less than 0.05). Agonal hepatic arterial blood flow remained constant (415 +/- 30 milliliters per minute) in pretreated pigs during asphyxia, but was markedly reduced (98.6 +/- 63.3 milliliters per minute) in nonpretreated pigs (p less than 0.05). Results of this study demonstrate the agonal occurrence of hepatic arterial vasospasm and its prevention with Dibenzyline. Donor pretreatment with alpha-adrenergic antagonists may be indicated in clinical organ procurement to prevent agonal arterial vasospasm and its potentially adverse effect on early hepatic allograft function.\r"

The neurological status changed subjectively during the procedure, with the patient becoming unresponsive to verbal stimuli as the intracranial pressure reached a minimum.

Death due to CAD in parents was associated with a 30% increase in the risk of CAD. The effect was apparently stronger for an early CAD outcome, with adjusted relative risks of 1.5 for early and 1.2 for late outcome CAD. The effect of parental CAD death on risk was not mediated by other shared risk factors for CAD. These findings were similar for those with either a mother or a father with CAD, if CAD onset in the offspring occurred before the age of 60 years. For persons with CAD at age 60 years or older, maternal CAD death was a stronger predictor of CAD than paternal CAD death. The association with parental history of CAD was similar among men and women in the cohort, with adjusted relative risks of 1.3 and 1.2, respectively. However, early age of parental CAD death may account for the association among women (RR = 1.6), whereas late age of CAD death for either parent was associated with the risk of CAD among men (RR = 1.4).\r"

Nineteen patients (38%) were asymptomatic and 31 patients (62%) had minimal angina (at most 1 episode/month, and with marked exertion only). Exercise-induced ischemia was present in 45 of 49 patients (92%) tested. The remaining 5 patients had a critical stenosis in a vessel supplying a large myocardial territory. A total of 75 lesions were dilated, 71 successfully (95%). There were no procedural deaths or infarctions. The single complication was an urgent bypass operation. After PTCA, only 3 of 46 patients exercised (7%) had inducible ischemia (p less than 0.0005 vs before PTCA). At a mean follow-up of 36 months, 46 of 49 patients alive (94%) were asymptomatic (p less than 0.0005 vs before PTCA). The 3-year actuarial survival and infarct-free survival were 98 and 96%, respectively. However, 5 patients (10%) crossed over to bypass surgery and 14 patients (28%) underwent repeat PTCA. Progression of native coronary disease was present in 9 of these patients (47%). As in symptomatic patients, elective PTCA can be performed safely and with a high success rate in patients with silent ischemia, and can markedly reduce the incidence of exercise-induced ischemia. With this approach, greater than 90% of the patients were asymptomatic at the 3-year follow-up; however, 34% required a further revascularization procedure for restenosis or progression of native disease or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group C comprised 12 patients without sustained ISDN therapy and group N included 12 patients with sustained ISDN therapy. Before and during administration of sublingual ISDN in both groups, aortic systolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and coronary artery diameter were examined at cardiac catheterization. During sublingual ISDN, the aortic systolic pressure decreased by 20 +/- 6% (138 +/- 26 to 112 +/- 27 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) in group C and 10 +/- 6% (127 +/- 26 to 113 +/- 23 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) in group N (p less than 0.01, group C vs group N).

During sublingual ISDN, the diameters of the proximal and distal segments of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries increased more significantly in group C than in group N (p less than 0.01, group C vs group N). Thus, sublingual ISDN produced less reduction of aortic systolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and less dilation of coronary artery diameter in patients receiving sustained therapy with ISDN than in those without sustained therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, a period of reduced or low nitrate plasma levels of a few hours per day may limit or completely prevent tolerance development. In 18 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, a single 60-mg daily dose of a controlled-release preparation of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN) was compared with the administration of 30 mg, 4 times daily, of immediate-release isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The comparisons were carried out on the first day of therapy and after 11 to 14 days of continuous therapy to assess the duration of effectiveness and the development of tolerance. On short-term therapy, both drugs produced a significant improvement in treadmill walking times to moderate angina in comparison with placebo. The values for ISMN were 87 +/- 99 seconds (23%) at 12:30 P.M., 72 +/- 91 seconds (19%) at 5 P.M. and 51 +/- 81 seconds (13%) at 8:30 P.M. For ISDN, the respective values were 71 +/- 83 seconds (19%), 89 +/- 98 seconds (24%) and 79 +/- 87 seconds (21%). There were no significant differences between drugs.

  ".W": "Controversy persists regarding the presence and extent of right ventricular involvement with acute anterior injury. Also unclear are the incidence and significance of ST elevations in the right-sided leads in acute left anterior descending artery occlusion. Baseline and coronary occlusion hemodynamics and 15-lead electrocardiograms (addition of RV3 through RV5) were recorded in 42 patients during 32 left anterior descending and 13 right coronary artery angioplasties. The right coronary and left anterior descending artery angioplasties had similar baseline right and left ventricular hemodynamics, as well as identical right atrial to pulmonary wedge pressure ratios (0.51 right coronary vs 0.51 left anterior descending). Whereas the right coronary and left anterior descending occlusions produced similar elevations in right ventricular filling pressures, the left anterior descending occlusions produced greater elevations in left ventricular filling pressures. The right atrial to pulmonary wedge ratio increased with right coronary occlusions, but was unchanged with left anterior descending occlusions (0.79 right vs 0.46 left, p less than or equal to 0.0001). Presence of right-lead ST elevations in 10 left anterior descending occlusions did not con-note increased right ventricular filling pressures, but did suggest increased left ventricular ischemia and dysfunction. In conclusion, right ventricular dysfunction, as manifested by increased filling pressures, is seen with both right coronary and left anterior descending occlusions. Although it is the predominant abnormality in right coronary occlusions, in left anterior descending occlusions it is proportional to left ventricular dysfunction. ST elevations in a right lead with left anterior descending occlusions do not constitute a marker for increased right ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Nineteen consecutive patients with a first anterior wall AMI who received 1,500,000 IU of streptokinase within 3 hours of symptom onset, followed by full anticoagulation, underwent echocardiographic studies within 24 hours of symptoms, and then on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 30 and 90. Forty-four patients, with comparable clinical features and echocardiographic protocol but without antithrombotic therapy, served as the control group. LV thrombi developed in 4 of 19 (21%) treated patients and in 23 of 44 (52%) control subjects (p = 0.02). LV aneurysm or major wall motion abnormalities were noted in 8 of 19 (42%) treated patients and in 30 of 44 (68%) control subjects (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between treated and untreated patients when comparing the incidence of thrombi in the subgroups of patients with aneurysm or major wall motion abnormalities (3 of 8 vs 21 of 30) and in the subgroups with less extensive LV dysfunction. Thrombi disappeared during hospitalization in 3 of 4 treated patients, but in none of the controls. Fewer patients treated with intravenous streptokinase followed by full anticoagulation developed LV thrombi compared to patients treated with conventional therapy. This difference may be related to a reduced occurrence of major LV wall motion abnormalities. Resolution of thrombi frequently occurs in the hospital phase of AMI; therefore, only frequent echocardiographic examinations can assess the true frequency of LV thrombi.\r"

In 22 critically ill patients with coronary artery disease (mean ejection fraction 27 +/- 13%), recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias proved refractory to 3.7 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- standard deviation) conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. In the 24-hour period before intravenous amiodarone treatment, patients experienced 2.4 +/- 2.3 (range 1 to 9) episodes of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or both, requiring 4.0 +/- 3.9 direct current cardioversions. Within the 24 hours after initiation of intravenous amiodarone therapy (900 to 1,600 mg/day), 20 of 22 patients remained alive and had 1.1 +/- 1.6 episodes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, requiring 1.9 +/- 3.1 direct current cardioversions. In the second 24-hour period, there were 19 survivors and life-threatening arrhythmias were reduced to 0.4 +/- 0.7 episode/patient requiring 0.4 +/- 0.9 direct current cardioversion. Overall, arrhythmias were controlled in 11 of 22 (50%) patients within the first 24 hours, and in 14 of 22 (64%) in the second 24 hours. Intravenous amiodarone therapy was well tolerated. Twelve patients were discharged from the hospital and 8 remained alive at a mean follow-up of 22 +/- 14 months. Thus, in critically ill patients, intravenous amiodarone may be useful for rapid control of spontaneous, refractory, life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r"

Hemodynamic measurements in 11 patients with CHF (ejection fraction 19 +/- 4%) were obtained before and immediately after the administration of digoxin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients were then followed for 1 year. Clinical status was determined using the Boston Clinical Heart Failure scoring system. Of the 11 patients, 6 demonstrated significant clinical improvement after therapy, based on the Boston score, over a 1-year period. Five patients did not respond to therapy: 4 died and the remaining patient had worsening CHF. There was no difference between responders and nonresponders in either baseline hemodynamics or acute response to the administration of digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In the patients who improved, plasma norepinephrine decreased from 706 +/- 235 to 545 +/- 223 pg/ml (p = 0.08) after 1 year of medical therapy. In patients whose CHF worsened or who died, plasma norepinephrine increased from 715 +/- 275 at baseline to 1,237 +/- 671 pg/ml at their last measurement (p = 0.06). Although at baseline the plasma norepinephrine levels were similar in both groups of patients, a significant difference between responders and nonresponders was observed at final follow-up (p less than 0.002). Change in plasma norepinephrine correlated with change in CHF score (r = 0.79, p less than 0.004). Thus, in patients with CHF, serial measurements of plasma norepinephrine correlate with changes in clinical status.\r"

Pulsed-wave Doppler-derived regurgitant fraction (obtained from aortic and pulmonary stroke volumes) and color flow mapping relative regurgitant area (obtained from the parasternal short-axis view) were chosen as reference standards for the severity of AR. An excellent correlation was found between these 2 parameters (r = 0.98), while correlations were poor between pressure half-time and either regurgitant fraction (r = -0.74) or relative regurgitant jet area (r = -0.69). The ratio of early (E) to late (A) transmitral peak velocities was used to divide the study population into 2 groups: group A (n = 16) with E/A less than 1 and group B (n = 14) with E/A greater than 1. In patients with a similar degree of AR (estimated from Doppler regurgitant fraction or relative regurgitant jet area), the pressure half-time was found to be significantly shorter. Thus, the severity of AR in group A patients was overestimated (p less than 0.01). Compared to group B, group A patients were significantly shorter. Thus, the severity of AR in group A patients was overestimated (p less than 0.01). Compared to group B, group A patients were significantly older (p less than 0.02) and had a larger left ventricular mass (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between August 1987 and November 1988, combined mitral and aortic balloon valvuloplasty was performed in 10 patients (mean age 42 +/- 9 years), all of whom had symptomatic mitral and aortic stenosis. The procedure was performed using a transarterial approach with a multiballoon catheter and an exteriorized intracardiac long guidewire circuit. The procedure could be considered successful in 9 patients where significant increases in the mean mitral (0.97 +/- 0.19 to 1.80 +/- 0.26 cm2) and aortic (0.63 +/- 0.18 to 1.15 +/- 0.32 cm2) areas were achieved. Severe mitral regurgitation that required surgery developed in 1 patient in the following 24 hours. Femoral vascular surgery was necessary in 1 patient. Mid-term follow-up was available in 8 patients for a period averaging 8 +/- 3 months. The 9 patients in whom the procedure was successful showed persistent clinical improvement in functional class, Doppler echocardiography showed 2 cases of aortic restenosis and none of mitral restenosis. Combined mitral and aortic balloon valvuloplasty could be a valid alternative treatment in selected patients with both mitral and aortic rheumatic stenosis. Further experience and long-term hemodynamic follow-up are necessary to define the role of this mode of treatment.\r"

This quantitative study investigated the relation between instantaneous sound frequencies contained in heart murmurs and magnitudes of Doppler jet velocities measured distal to associated obstructions. Heart murmurs were recorded from 18 patients, ages 1 day to 23 years, with 21 separate murmurs resulting from abnormal valves (18 studies) or left-to-right shunts (3 studies). Recorded murmurs were digitized and divided into 12.3-ms time segments for computer frequency analysis using the maximum entropy method. Murmur spectra were plotted in gray scale against time. All murmurs contained dominant frequencies that varied with time. Dominant murmur frequencies and associated Doppler jet velocities at equivalent points in time were measured at 50-ms intervals. For 88 points analyzed, instantaneous dominant frequencies ranged from 130 to 410 Hz (mean +/- standard deviation 282 +/- 70 Hz) and instantaneous jet velocities ranged from 110 to 460 cm/s (290 +/- 80 cm/s). For the 21 murmurs studied, peak murmur frequencies ranged from 200 to 410 Hz (308 +/- 70 Hz) and peak jet velocities ranged from 165 to 460 cm/s (320 +/- 78 cm/s). Instantaneous dominant frequency correlated to instantaneous jet velocity (r = 0.85) and peak dominant frequency correlated to peak jet velocity (r = 0.89). This in vivo study demonstrates that dominant frequencies contained in heart murmurs are related to instantaneous jet velocities distal to associated obstructions.\r"

LV filling measurements differed little between men and women. Age was correlated positively with atrial filling duration (r = 0.55), atrial filling duration fraction (r = 0.52) and atrial filling fraction (r = 0.56) and negatively with rapid filling fraction (r = -0.58). Age was not correlated with peak filling rate, time to peak filling rate and first-half filling fraction. The heart rate at rest was significantly negatively correlated with rapid (r = -0.62), slow (r = -0.81) and atrial (r = -0.72) filling durations, but not with isovolumic duration. The heart rate at rest was weakly positively correlated with peak filling rate in end-diastolic volume per second (r = 0.36) and negatively correlated with first-half filling fraction (r = -0.35). Systolic pressure at rest influenced atrial filling duration. LV ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume index were not correlated significantly with LV filling in relatively normal subjects.\r"

All subjects were questioned about their ability to perform a variety of common activities by an interviewer blinded to exercise test findings. A 12-item scale (the Duke Activity Status Index) was then developed that correlated well with peak oxygen uptake (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.80). To test this new index, an independent group of 50 subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire to determine functional capacity and underwent exercise testing with measurement of peak oxygen uptake. The Duke Activity Status Index correlated significantly (p less than 0.0001) with peak oxygen uptake (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.58) in this independent sample. The Duke Activity Status Index is a valid measure of functional capacity that can be obtained by self-administered questionnaire.\r"

In 30 of them, ages 57 +/- 10 years, left-sided heart catheterization was performed at the same time. The sample volume was positioned exactly in the mitral anulus plane, bisecting the anulus. The ratio of the time-velocity integrals of the A wave (atrial contraction) and E wave (early filling) was calculated (A/E ratio of integrals). Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant linear correlation of the A/E ratio of integrals with regard to left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.98, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = 0.98, p less than 0.001). The A/E ratio of integrals also correlated with other hemodynamic parameters, such as cardiac output (r = -0.73, p less than 0.001), cardiac index (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001) and stroke volume index (r = -0.65, p less than 0.001). For 19 additional patients, ages 55 +/- 8 years, the values of LV end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were calculated by means of the corresponding formulas from the first data set. The correlation between the calculated and invasively measured LV filling pressures expressed in terms of intraclass correlation coefficients shows highly significant correlations for both LV end-diastolic pressure (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy with which left ventricular volume is determined from contrast ventriculograms depends on the care with which the analysis protocol is followed. Therefore, the effect of variations in the method used for calculating the correction factor (CF) that adjusts for magnification and image distortion on volume calculation was measured. The results showed that error in the CF is caused by (in order of decreasing importance): filming the calibration figure at a different magnification mode from that of the ventriculogram, at a different height from the table than the level of the ventricle, or with the image intensifier at a different height than used during ventriculography; use of a calibration figure less than half the size of the ventricle; calculation of the CF from only 1 band pair of a banded catheter; or placement of the calibration figure at the periphery rather than the center of the imaging field. Error in volume determination was proportional to error in the CF. With care, the error in volume can be reduced to that due to interobserver variability in tracing the endocardial contours.\r"
