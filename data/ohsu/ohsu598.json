  ".W": "During a study period from 1977 through 1984, 11 (0.4%) of 2651 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy at The Cleveland Clinic had early, symptomatic thrombosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and underwent urgent reoperations. With only two exceptions, neurologic deficits occurred after lucid intervals when the patients had recovered from general anesthesia and were discovered within the first 8 hours in three patients, within 8 to 24 hours in five patients, and on the second postoperative day in one patient. Surgical management consisted of thrombectomy alone in two patients, thrombectomy and vein patch angioplasty in eight patients, and thrombectomy of the external carotid artery with ligation of the ICA in a single patient in whom retrograde ICA flow could not be reestablished. Eight (73%) of the 11 patients recovered substantial neurologic function after reoperations, six of whom had complete or nearly complete resolution of their symptoms. One patient (9%) sustained a fatal hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. In a collected series of 41 patients from this study and other reports, prompt surgical treatment of thrombosis occurring after carotid endarterectomy was associated with clinical improvement in 61% of patients and appears to be the preferred approach to this catastrophic complication.\r"

  ".U": "89362720\r", 
  ".W": "From 1957 to 1985, 116 consecutive operations for recurrent carotid stenosis were performed in 99 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. Ninety-four patients underwent 103 reoperations for primary recurrent stenosis (nine patients had bilateral repairs). Seventy-two operations (70%) were performed to relieve cerebrovascular symptoms whereas the indication for 31 operations (30%) was high-grade stenosis. The cause of primary recurrent stenosis was myointimal hyperplasia (MIH) in 47 cases, whereas 56 were caused by recurrent atherosclerosis (ASO). Secondary recurrent stenosis developed in six patients from our own series (5.8%) and an additional six patients were referred after reoperation elsewhere. The 12 lesions in this group were evenly divided between MIH (six) and recurrent ASO (six). MIH resulted in a single tertiary recurrent stenosis. Myointimectomy or repeat endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty were the most commonly used techniques for repair of a primary recurrent stenosis. Secondary recurrent stenosis necessitated resection of the carotid bifurcation and graft interposition when caused by MIH. Secondary recurrent stenosis caused by ASO could be treated by repeat endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty in five of six cases. Five strokes occurred in the entire series (4.3%), resulting in two deaths. There were 23 cranial nerve palsies, which rarely persisted beyond 3 months. The morbidity and mortality rates for primary and secondary carotid reoperation are comparable to the original procedure and should not deter the vascular surgeon from reoperative carotid reconstruction whenever indicated.\r"

Among these, glossopharyngeal nerve injury is an uncommon complication because it is remote from the field of dissection in most carotid procedures. From more than 2000 carotid operations four cases of symptomatic ninth cranial nerve injury were identified. Analysis revealed that dissection cephalad to the level of the hypoglossal nerve was a common feature of each and severe functional disability can result from glossopharyngeal nerve paresis. When mobilization of this nerve and division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and styloid process become necessary for additional exposure, the risk of glossopharyngeal nerve injury increases. Specific recommendations are made regarding management and maneuvers to help reduce the incidence of this uncommon, yet potentially serious, complication.\r"

There were no postoperative infections, occlusions, emboli, stroke, or pseudoaneurysms. In addition, no clinically detectable recurrent stenoses developed in this high-risk group of patients. Twenty-four of the 27 patients available for follow-up were screened for asymptomatic stenoses with spectral analysis and B-mode imaging; there was no sign of hemodynamically significant recurrent stenosis in this group. These encouraging results support the continued selective use of Dacron patch graft angioplasty in carotid surgery.\r"

To prevent possible ischemic complications, most surgeons favor revascularization of the distal subclavian artery. Thoracotomy has been the traditional approach for division or reimplantation of the aberrant right subclavian artery. We describe a modification (right supraclavicular incision) of an extrathoracic approach, which was first described by Orvald in 1972, to simplify simultaneous correction of dysphagia lusoria and revascularization of the right upper extremity.\r"

  ".W": "In a pilot study involving 13 patients with advanced stage IV renal cell carcinoma, anti-tumor effects and toxicity of a novel form of adoptive immunotherapy were determined. The protocol utilizes infusions of autologous mononuclear leukocytes treated with the oxidizing mitogen sodium periodate (IO4-) and cultured in medium containing human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), and continuous infusions of low-dose IL-2 (mean +/- SD dose = 39.5 +/- 8.6 X 10(3) U/kg/24 hours). Leukocytes (5 to 10 X 10(9] were removed by leukapheresis three times per week, mononuclear cells were separated, activated with IO4- and cultured in medium containing IL-2 (500 U/ml) for 48 to 72 hours. The cells were re-infused following the next leukapheresis procedure. IL-2 was administered five days per week. Treatment was continued for two three-week cycles. An increase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells bearing the natural killer cell (NK) surface marker, Leu 11, an increase in NK- and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and a slight increase in spontaneous cytotoxicity for non-NK targets were noted. Regressions (more than 50 percent decrease in tumor mass) of pulmonary, liver, bone, or soft tissue metastases were induced in six patients. Severe fluid retention did not develop in any patient and no patient required treatment in the intensive care unit. Five of the patients who showed a response have experienced a relapse at 5.2 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SD) months. These observations indicate that IO4-/IL-2-activated killer cells plus continuous infusions of low-dose IL-2 can result in regression of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\r"

The IL-2 regimen produced progressive hypotension, azotemia, and sodium avidity (fractional excretion of sodium = 0.20 +/- 0.07 percent) despite massive fluid administration (mean: 18.4 liter per five days) and weight gain (mean: 4.0 kg). Plasma renin activity rose. Hypoalbuminemia developed rapidly (3.6 +/- 0.1 g/dl to 2.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl, p less than 0.01) with widespread edema formation despite normal central venous pressures. Hematocrit did not change during the IL-2 period, consistent with a \"capillary-leak.\" Hemodynamic and renal functional changes reversed after the IL-2 regimen was discontinued, but hypoalbuminemia and elevated urinary n-acetyl-glucosaminidase levels persisted after six days. These studies demonstrate widespread hemodynamic and vascular effects of IL-2 administration that limit its safe use and suggest a possible role for the lymphokine in mediating cardiovascular instability under other circumstances, such as endotoxic shock.\r"

An autogenous fibrin sealant was freshly prepared for each case by adding CaCl2 to centrifuged plasma from the rabbit's citrated blood sample and mixing it with 500 micron/mL of bovine thrombin. This coagulum was injected into and under the retinal hole in one eye; the other eye served as a control. The intraocular fibrin sealant appeared nontoxic and noninflammatory.

Athletic injuries to both the central nervous system and spinal cord demand our attention as an active area of clinical and basic injury. A review of the available literature reveals changing injury patterns as well as current concepts regarding the mechanism responsible for most athletic injuries to these structures. Accurate descriptions of the mechanism(s) responsible for a particular injury transcend simple academic interest. In order that preventive measures be implemented, the manner in which injury occurs must be accurately defined.

Forty-two subjects (89.4 percent) achieved the summit in an average of 34.5 hours after leaving sea level. At the summit or high point attained above base camp, the group taking dexamethasone reported less headache, tiredness, dizziness, nausea, clumsiness, and a greater sense of feeling refreshed (p less than or equal to 0.05). In addition, they reported fewer problems of runny nose and feeling cold, symptoms unrelated to acute mountain sickness. The acetazolamide group differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) from other groups at low elevations (1,300 to 1,600 m), in that they experienced more feelings of nausea and tiredness, and they were less refreshed. These drug side effects probably obscured the previously established prophylactic effects of acetazolamide for acute mountain sickness. Separate analysis of an acetazolamide subgroup that did not experience side effects at low elevations revealed a prophylactic effect of acetazolamide similar in magnitude to the dexamethasone effect but lacking the euphoric effects of dexamethasone. This study demonstrates that prophylaxis with dexamethasone can reduce the symptoms associated with acute mountain sickness during active ascent and that acetazolamide can cause side effects that may limit its effectiveness as prophylaxis against the disease.\r"

Critical to this process is establishing the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of medical tests and the effectiveness of interventions. Meta-analysis is an approach that applies statistical methods to groups of studies in order to extract consensus results. Electronic spreadsheets facilitate meta-analysis with their ability to store, sort, graph, and mathematically manipulate both the methodologic approaches and clinical findings of seemingly disparate studies. As an example, this application is demonstrated with an analysis of studies that were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of exercise testing in patients recovering from a myocardial infarction. The following conclusions were reached: (1) patients excluded from exercise testing have the highest mortality; (2) only subsets of patients have been tested resulting in highly selected patient samples that make findings difficult to generalize; (3) of the five exercise test responses, only an abnormal systolic blood pressure response and a poor exercise capacity predicted risk more frequently than by chance; (4) submaximal or predischarge testing has greater predictive power than postdischarge or maximal testing; and (5) exercise-induced ST segment depression only appears to be predictive of increased risk in patients with inferior-posterior myocardial infarctions. This approach to combining studies is important since even careful analysis of a single study cannot elucidate all of the complex interactions and selective biases that have occurred. However, comparison of many heterogeneous studies is at best an arduous and time-consuming task. This approach to using electronic spreadsheets to collate and analyze multiple studies facilitates recognition of the population characteristics, clinical factors, and methodologic considerations that affect outcome and allows the quick inclusion of additional studies for re-analysis and interpretation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of improving diabetic control on secondary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea was investigated in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Second, the hypothesis that increased central (hypothalamic) opiate inhibition may have been responsible for the suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was tested by observing the effect of a four-hour naloxone infusion (1.4 mg/hour) on serum gonadotropin levels. All known causes of secondary amenorrhea were excluded before patients were eligible for the study. The median duration of amenorrhea was six years, and median body weight was 101 percent of ideal. After six months of improved metabolic control (n = 5) using intensified conventional therapy or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, the level of glycosylated hemoglobin dropped from 11.8 +/- 0.9 percent to 8.5 +/- 0.5 percent (p less than 0.005), and body weight increased from 60.5 +/- 1.8 kg to 64.7 +/- 1.4 kg (p less than 0.02). Menses did not, however, return in any patient. There was no significant change in serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, dihydroxyepiandrosterone, testosterone, prolactin, basal or GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone. There was no change in the levels of luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone during the naloxone infusion either during poor metabolic control or after six months of improved metabolic control. In conclusion, a form of secondary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea was identified in patients with IDDM that did not remit with sustained improvements in metabolic control. It did not appear to be mediated through increased central opiate tone.\r"

In a series of 10 patients with visceral leishmaniasis complicating renal transplantation (three), hematologic neoplasms (two), systemic lupus erythematosus (two), or infection with human immunodeficiency virus (three), typical hallmarks of kalaazar such as enlargement of spleen or hyperglobulinemia were absent in three and six patients, respectively. Extensive visceral involvement was noted by biopsies or autopsies in four patients. Diagnosis was made during evaluation for fever of unknown origin. Myriads of amastigotes were seen in bone marrow smears. Measurement of antibodies against Leishmania donovani was positive in each patient tested. Ultimately, three patients died, and chronic infections refractory to treatment developed in two other patients. Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal infection in immunocompromised hosts. Current antiparasitic therapy frequently fails to eradicate L. donovani from infected tissues.\r"

The study drug was initiated at the time of first fever along with antibiotics and was continued until neutropenia resolved, fungal sepsis occurred, or persistent or recurrent unexplained fever after six or more days prompted substitution of the study drug by amphotericin B. Two hundred eight treatment courses in 180 patients were evaluated. Fungal sepsis occurred in only one patient receiving miconazole compared with eight patients receiving placebo (p = 0.03). Fatal fungal sepsis occurred in four patients receiving placebo and in none of the patients receiving miconazole (p = 0.08). There was no evidence for the development of resistance to polyenes or imidazoles in fungal isolates recovered from patients in this randomized trial or an increase in Aspergillus infections in patients who received miconazole in this randomized trial or in 121 subsequently treated patients who received unblinded use of miconazole. Thus, intravenous miconazole was more effective than placebo in preventing fungal sepsis in patients with chemotherapy-induced prolonged neutropenia.\r"

Recent development of new hormonal treatment options (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and estramustine) has yet to demonstrate potential for improving the therapeutic index or for lengthening survival over results achieved with traditional modalities (i.e., supplemental estrogens or castration). Chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated palliative efficacy and are being tested in multidrug regimens and in combination with hormones. At the present time, the optimal use of cytotoxic drugs remains undefined, since recently published studies have shown neither that combination chemotherapy is superior to single agents nor that chemo-hormonal therapy produces more favorable results than hormonal treatment alone.\r"

Sixty-four percent have been men. Fifty-seven percent have had a history of prior trauma. Laboratory values for systemic measures have usually been normal. The disease usually arrests spontaneously, but this is unpredictable. Sixteen patients (16 percent) have died of the disorder, with 10 deaths due to chest wall involvement, three to spinal cord transection, two to sepsis, and one to asphyxia and aspiration. Although the mechanism of bone loss is unknown, osteoclasts were focally increased in the case described herein.

Either increased dietary calcium or prednisone seemed to suppress the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D value. Nephrolithiasis or abnormalities suggestive of pseudoxanthoma elasticum occurred in the patient's father, daughter, and several siblings, suggesting a distinct familial syndrome in which connective tissue changes are accompanied by abnormalities of phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism that may resemble those in the syndrome of familial tumoral calcinosis.

Previous diuretic therapy was continued. Sitting and five-minute standing blood pressure and heart rate measurements were made 24 hours after dosing. At the endpoint of treatment, both nifedipine GITS and sustained-release propranolol reduced blood pressure compared with placebo (p less than 0.001) in the sitting and standing positions. Nifedipine GITS was more effective in lowering standing systolic blood pressure than was propranolol (p less than 0.02). Propranolol caused a greater reduction in resting heart rate than did nifedipine GITS (p less than 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated. Nifedipine GITS is an effective and safe once-daily drug for use in patients with hypertension who are already receiving diuretics, may be more effective than sustained-release propranolol, and may be better tolerated than conventional nifedipine capsules.\r"

During a one-week wash-out phase, antihypertensive therapy was discontinued in all patients. After a three-week single-blind placebo period, eligible patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to one of three treatment groups for a one-week titration period and a nine-week efficacy period. Patients received either nifedipine GITS, 30 or 60 mg daily; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 or 50 mg daily; or placebo. Sitting and standing blood pressures decreased by an average 11.6/10.4 and 10.8/10.8 mm Hg, respectively, with nifedipine GITS therapy, and 14.8/10.8 and 14.3/8.2 mm Hg, respectively, with hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Compared with placebo, these changes were highly significant for both sitting (p less than or equal to 0.005) and standing (p less than or equal to 0.02) measurements. Heart rate remained essentially unchanged in all three groups. It was therefore concluded that monotherapy with nifedipine GITS, at doses of 30 or 60 mg given once daily, effectively reduces blood pressure in patients with hypertension to a degree comparable with that seen in hydrochlorothiazide therapy.\r"

Eight hours post-dose exercise testing resulted in a significant increase in time to onset of angina for all three dose levels of nifedipine but not for placebo. Exercise testing 24 hours after dosing showed significant improvement in time to angina and total exercise time for patients receiving 60-mg and 90-mg doses but not for the 30-mg or placebo categories. These preliminary results suggest that this new formulation of nifedipine is beneficial when added to stable doses of a beta blocker in patients in whom angina is still exhibited during exercise testing.\r"

Owing to the frequent coexistence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis in heterosexual men, treatment regimens for gonococcal urethritis should generally include an effective antichlamydial regimen. Complications of urethritis are uncommon, but the causative pathogens produce serious morbidity in women. Prevention of urethritis is based on identification of asymptomatically infected persons who serve as the major reservoir of infection with both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis.\r"

The primary infection typically is associated with systemic signs and symptoms and painful genital lesions, with a high rate of complications. Recurrences are much milder, with less frequent complications. Although many rapid diagnostic tests for genital herpes are now available, none is as sensitive or reliable as tissue culture. Dilemmas still exist regarding the best management strategy for the expectant mother at risk for transmitting HSV to the neonate, in part because of limitations in current diagnostic techniques. Although current treatment regimens with acyclovir can effectively control most symptoms and improve healing of lesions, they appear to have no effect on decreasing the frequency of subsequent recurrences. Short-term chronic suppression with acyclovir is effective in preventing symptomatic recurrences and appears to be relatively free of toxicity, but long-term studies are only now in progress. Asymptomatic viral shedding associated with either primary or recurrent infections and its contribution to sexual transmission of the disease are just now being fully appreciated, and the effect of therapy on subsequent transmission of disease remains to be determined. HSV genital infection in the immunocompromised host can produce a more severe and prolonged illness than in the normal host, but reactivation of the infection can be prevented with acyclovir suppression. Further research is needed on many aspects of the host-HSV interaction, especially regarding the factors involved in recurrences and the importance of the host's immune response to the manifestations of disease.\r"

Therapy of first episode herpes may not be indicated in patients whose symptoms and lesions are clearly resolving at the time of presentation, and intravenous acyclovir therapy should be considered in patients with first episode herpes who require hospitalization. A viral culture should be obtained prior to initiating treatment in persons with first episode genital herpes, and typing should be performed to predict the risk and frequency of subsequent recurrences. Serologic differentiation of primary and nonprimary first episode disease is generally not performed outside the research setting. Suppression of recurrent genital herpes infections with daily oral acyclovir therapy has been shown to be safe and effective when continued for periods for up to 2 years. Oral acyclovir suppression should be considered in patients with frequent recurrences who complain of significant morbidity in association with their genital herpes infections (Table 2). The clinical benefit from episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes infections is less dramatic. Patient-initiated therapy with oral acyclovir at the first sign of prodome or lesions should be considered in patients with relatively severe recurrences who are not candidates for suppressive treatment. Virologic confirmation of infection is encouraged. Oral acyclovir is the treatment of choice for short-term or long-term suppression in immunocompromised hosts, although short-term suppression with intravenous acyclovir may be indicated for persons who cannot take oral medications. Episodic treatment with topical, oral, and intravenous acyclovir is effective in immunocompromised patients, but topical treatment should be limited to persons with external lesions only.\r"

However, only 40 per cent of published papers with IFN have been appropriately controlled. The toxicity of these newer preparations when administered either topically or parenterally prevents their immediate licensing for general use. The toxic to therapeutic ratio for HuIFN and rIFN appears to be close to one in most clinical situations in which it has been tested. Although interferons have not proved to be the \"penicillin\" for viruses many thought they would become, basic in vitro work and clinical studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of host defense and immunopathology. Future studies must focus on increasing our understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity, in addition to devising controlled clinical trials with interferon alone or in combination with other antiviral agents. Thus, after 30 years of research on interferons, it would appear our work has just begun.\r"

Patients with underlying conditions such as congenital heart disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. Methods for rapid diagnosis of RSV infection and the advent of specific therapy with aerosolized ribavirin have revolutionized the management of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease. A 3- to 5-day course of ribavirin plus supportive measures should be used in infants who prove to be infected by RSV and who are deteriorating on traditional supportive therapy, and/or who have underlying cardiac and/or pulmonary or immune defects.\r"

  ".W": "In this article we have described the clinical and laboratory features of uncomplicated influenza in college students and its treatment with ribavirin aerosol. The disease presents as an acute febrile systemic illness of short duration that varies little from patient to patient. Peripheral blood cell changes in the infection are also quite specific and very consistent. Polymorphonuclear cell counts are slightly increased above normal early in infection at a time when lymphocyte counts were greatly reduced. As lymphocyte numbers increase at the third day of illness, polymorphonuclear cell counts diminish substantially. Eosinophil counts fluctuate in a pattern similar to that of lymphocytes. Basophil, monocyte, and band cell counts are increased at admission and thereafter decline in numbers. Reticulocytes and platelets are reduced during acute illness. We assume that changes in peripheral white blood cell counts during influenza result from migration of cells to the inflamed respiratory tract and subsequent resupply of the various types of cells to the circulation from other sites in the body. The cellular alterations in the circulation and at the site of infection are of fundamental importance in the pathogenesis of infection, and a better knowledge of them should open new avenues for prevention and treatment. Aerosol treatment was shown to alleviate the symptoms of influenza and to reduce the shedding of influenza virus from the respiratory tract. No evidence of untoward effect of ribavirin treatment on peripheral white or red blood cells was found, and a wide range of clinical chemical tests revealed no toxic effects of treatment. There was no pulmonary irritation detected from the treatment. Reference was made to prompt recovery of four patients with influenzal pneumonia treated with ribavirin aerosol. Ribavirin aerosol must produce its major therapeutic effect through inhibition of virus replication at the sites of infection in the respiratory epithelium. This appears to result mainly from interference with viral messenger RNA initiation and elongation. This is best demonstrated by the prompt decline in viral shedding in treated patients. The associated prompt clinical improvement suggests that illness results from continued virus replication, and when virus replication is retarded, improvement follows. Although treatment promptly reduces illness and virus shedding, antibody response is not reduced in treated patients. We emphasized that ribavirin aerosol had a major therapeutic effect on infections caused by both influenza A and B viruses, and the picture of illness with these types of influenza was not clinically distinguishable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the development of diagnostic tests for viral diseases has proceeded at a rapid pace that should facilitate the proper use of the antivirals when they become available.

It primarily affects skin, nervous system, heart, and joints. It is an infectious disease caused by a spirochete Borellia burgdorferi, which is transmitted chiefly by Ixodes dammini and pacificus ticks in the United States and Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Diagnosis is based on patient contact with an endemic area, one or more characteristic clinical features, particularly erythema migrans rash, and a positive serologic test for B. burgdorferi infection in the majority of cases. Although infection is the primary cause of the disease, immune mechanisms may play a synergistic role in some manifestations. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for full recovery. Treatment with oral tetracycline or penicillin is effective in the earliest stages but late complications require high doses of intravenous penicillin and sometimes corticosteroids. Some late complications are refractory to antibiotic therapy. Antibody appears to be protective in human and experimental studies.\r"

  ".U": "89156405\r", 
  ".W": "The highest figure for first-time UTI is found in infants below one year of age. These early infections are often pyelonephritic in character, but they are easily overlooked because symptoms are unspecific, high fever and failure to thrive being the most important. It has been shown that delay in start of treatment increases the risk of the child developing pyelonephritic scarring. There is reason to believe that undetected and therefore untreated attacks of pyelonephritis may be associated with renal scarring revealed later in life. This type of renal damage is associated with development of hypertension in about 10 per cent of children and it accounts for around 20 per cent of the children entered into dialysis and transplant programs. Prevention of such long-term problems would be of great value and pyelonephritic scarring is a potentially preventable disease. The majority of infants and young children with UTI are probably managed at the primary care level. It is therefore essential that general practitioners are well informed about the epidemiology of UTI in infancy and childhood and that adequate diagnostic facilities are provided. For example, suprapubic aspiration to obtain uncontaminated urine is a technique that may well be used in an outpatient setting, and dipslide cultures are accurate and inexpensive. In addition to young age, vesicoureteric reflux and repeated attacks of pyelonephritis are risk factors associated with development of renal scarring. Therefore, diagnostic imaging to detect children with anomalies within the urinary tract are especially important in the very young. Furthermore, long-term supervision should be provided and the parents advised to consult the doctor when there is suspicion of a new infection to avoid delay in treatment. There is no reason to perform general screening for bacteriuria in healthy infants. Although bacteriuria may be found in 1 to 2 per cent, asymptomatic children have a very high rate of spontaneous clearing of the bacteriuria and they seem to constitute a low-risk group. Instead, frequent culturing of urine from febrile infants would be much more important.\r"

Still, the virulence concept implies that bacteria associated with urinary tract infections differ from members of the indigenous flora not causing infections. This review attempts to summarize the mechanisms known to contribute to bacterial virulence in the urinary tract and their relevance in different patient groups.\r"

While the adverse effects of asymptomatic bacteriuria on maternal and fetal health continue to be debated, it is clear that asymptomatic bacteriuria is the major risk factor for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection and that symptomatic infections are associated with significant maternal and fetal risks. Because the majority of symptomatic urinary tract infections develop in women with bacteriuria earlier in pregnancy, treatment of bacteriuria is undertaken to prevent symptomatic infections. All women should be screened at the first antenatal visit, which is reliably and inexpensively done with a dipstick culture. Short-course therapy is as effective as prolonged therapy and should be followed with a repeat culture to document clearing of the bacteriuria. Failure to eliminate bacteriuria with repeated therapy or recurrence with the same organism is indicative of renal parenchymal infection or a structural abnormality. All women with persistent bacteriuria or recurrent infection should have follow-up cultures and a complete urologic evaluation after delivery.\r"

  ".W": "The two most common indications for long-term catheterization are recalcitrant urinary incontinence and urinary obstruction that is not corrected by surgery. For incontinent patients, if behavioral changes, nursing care, special clothes, special bed clothes, and medications have not been successful, then a device to collect urine must be considered. For men such a device is a condom catheter; for women an analogous external collection device would be very useful. Suprapubic catheterization may offer an alternative but has been inadequately studied in this patient population. Long-term urinary catheterization has salutary effects for selected patients including patient comfort, family satisfaction, and nursing efficiency and effectiveness. To the patient for whom any physical movement is uncomfortable or painful, and indwelling catheter may be preferable to frequent changes of clothes. Similarly, the family of of severely impaired patients may want to accept the risks of urethral catheterization in order to keep the patient dry. Further, to the extent that the indwelling catheter is effective in decubitus ulcer prevention and/or management, long-term catheterization may diminish the risk of bacteremia or death from soft tissue infection. These benefits of long-term urethral catheterization, in addition to its risks, should be examined in future studies. Once a urethral catheter is in place, even with good catheter hygiene, bacterial entry can be postponed only temporarily; eventually all patients become bacteriuric. Indeed, as the catheter remains in place, organisms continue to enter, others leave or die, and the bacteriuria becomes complex, polymicrobial, and dynamic. Some organisms, particularly recognized uropathogens such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae, appear to reside in the urinary tract itself. Others, such as P. mirabilis, P. stuartii, and M. morganii, probably establish a niche within the urinary catheter, thus increasing their ability to cause subsequent bladder bacteriuria. The complications of long-term urinary catheterization include fevers, acute pyelonephritis, and bacteremias (such as seen in short-term catheterized patients), as well as catheter obstructions, urinary stones, chronic renal inflammation, local periurinary infections, vasicoureteral reflux, renal failure, and, for very long-term catheterized patients, bladder cancer. The thrust of catheter care for the long-term catheterized patient is to prevent complications of the omnipresent bacteriuria. Unfortunately, clinical opportunities for preventing complications are limited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Nonbacterial prostatitis, the most common syndrome, is an inflammation of the prostate of unknown cause. Patients with prostatodynia typically have sterile cultures and normal prostatic secretions but demonstrate an acquired voiding dysfunction on video-urodynamic testing. Since nonbacterial types of prostatitis have no recognized infectious cause, treatment using antimicrobial agents is ineffective and unwarranted.\r"

Recurrent infections with the same organism and at close intervals are frequently caused by a focus of bacterial persistence within the urinary tract, and infections with different organisms and/or at longer intervals are characteristic of reinfections with bacteria from outside the urinary tract. Unresolved infections are usually due to resistant bacteria and are treated by modification of therapy based on antimicrobial sensitivity testing. When unresolved bacteriuria is caused by organisms sensitive to the initial antimicrobial therapy, azotemia or a large bacterial mass density should be suspected. Recurrent infections at close intervals and/or with the same organism are usually caused by a bacterial focus in an acquired or congenital abnormality of the urinary tract such as infection stones, which must be removed to cure the recurrent infections. If the bacterial focus within the urinary tract cannot be removed, long-term low-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis can prevent the morbidity of recurrent infections. Reinfection requires careful bacteriologic monitoring and low-dose prophylactic, intermittent, or post-intercourse antimicrobial therapy.\r"

In general, the clinical presentation of these entities does not differentiate them; various radiographic studies can distinguish them, however. The intrarenal abscess is usually treated successfully with antibiotic therapy alone. Antistaphylococcal therapy is indicated for the renal cortical abscess, whereas therapy directed against the common gram-negative uropathogens is indicated for most of the other entities. The perinephric abscess is often an elusive diagnosis, has a more serious prognosis, and is more difficult to treat. Drainage of the abscess and sometimes partial or complete nephrectomy are required for resolution.\r"

An overall response rate of 94% was observed, with a 54% incidence of complete clinical response. The toxicity of the chemotherapy was judged acceptable, and no life-threatening or fatal drug-related side effects occurred. Twenty-four percent of the patients failed to comply with recommended standard treatment. In patients achieving a complete clinical response, 47% refused recommended surgery. Any response less than a complete clinical response to induction chemotherapy was not associated with any survival advantage. We conclude that future research efforts should be directed toward the identification of chemotherapeutic regimins that maximize the incidence of complete clinical response. In addition, any large-scale chemotherapy trial in patients with resectable disease should avoid the use of an induction sequence to minimize compliance problems with standard treatment.\r"

The primary central effect has not been proved to be serotonergic. Beta-endorphin is involved in the anorexic effect of fenfluramine and may play a role in autism. Nine children with infantile autism were treated with fenfluramine in double-blind, placebo-crossover design. Transient anorexia was the only adverse effect. Autistic behavior was reported to improve in three patients, but objective psychometric tests were unchanged. Beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity was determined in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of patients during and before or after treatment with fenfluramine and then was compared to normal controls. Beta-endorphin was elevated significantly in the baseline autistic group (p less than .005) and was reduced toward control values during fenfluramine treatment. The results are consistent with a role for beta-endorphin in infantile autism and in the mechanism of fenfluramine treatment.\r"

It encompasses a brief overview of ADD, including a review of the historical trends, causation, and a description of the clinical characteristics. Critical issues fundamental to understanding of ADD are addressed next. Evidence is presented to suggest that there are several groups of children with ADD who are currently under-identified and therefore, underserved (girls with ADD; ADD without hyperactivity). The concept is introduced of uncomplicated ADD and ADD-Plus (ADD-P), a term used to designate ADD associated with other complicating features such as conduct disorder. Specific methodologic issues and their relationship to the under-identification of these groups of children follows. This discussion encompasses the reasons for diagnostic imprecision and inconsistency, emphasizing the problem of selective referral patterns and how it results in an inaccurate portrait of ADD. We then present new approaches to the definition and diagnosis of ADD based on empiric studies designed to circumvent some of these problems. We conclude with a summary of the implications of these findings, and recommendations for public policy in ADD, particularly the need to recognize that ADD may occur even in the most intellectually gifted individuals and even in students in select colleges. Often these children with the highest potential are penalized most, not because of conceptual limitations or because they do not understand, but because educators often fail to recognize the symptom complex. Many of these children are succeeding through intelligence and great effort, but many more could succeed with proper identification.\r"

The existence of fra(X) chromosome in these patients was screened first by culturing peripheral blood lymphocytes in a medium in which folic acid was absent; the fra(X) chromosome then was confirmed by reculturing in another medium to which 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine was added for the last 24 hours of culture. Fra(X) chromosome was found in 2 of 39 male patients, but in none of the female patients; the 2 patients are siblings. Thus, fra(X) syndrome occurs in 2.6% (1/38) in this study population of male autistic children. The frequencies of fra(X) expression in the older brother with mild mental retardation, in the more severely retarded younger brother, and in their mother were 3-5%, 17-20%, and 9-3%, respectively. Of the two methods used in the present study, the method employing 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine tended to be more sensitive to fra(X) chromosome detection, especially for a suspected carrier.\r"

Given that of the patients interviewed, none recalled prodromal experience of transient motor paresis and none sustained further injury, this injury does not predispose individuals to permanent neurologic injury. No definite recurrence patterns have been established that would warrant the restriction of individuals from further activity. Activity restrictions are called for in the case of individuals with stability or chronic degenerative changes. Individuals with developmental spinal stenosis or spinal stenosis should be treated on an individual basis.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the available records indicates that there have been a substantial number of fatalities in boxers due to intracranial injuries sustained in the ring in comparison to the numbers engaged at both amateur and professional levels. The number of such fatalities has decreased steadily in recent years owing to different measures taken by boxing authorities to decrease the physical hazards in the ring and to improve monitoring of boxers during bouts by referees and physicians. The considerable concern about the long-term effects of repeated brain injury as the result of boxing in producing chronic encephalopathy is adequately justified by the many studies of live boxers and pathologic examinations of brains of former boxers made and recorded over the years since 1952. These indicate clearly a significant relationship between the numbers of bouts fought and the presence of severity of chronic encephalopathy. Because it is unlikely that currently adopted protective measures will substantially reduce these hazards, even though they have apparently reduced direct fatalities, a reasonable approach to prevention would be to reduce the number and severity of blows to the head. This might be done by making any blow to the head in boxing a foul and a reason for disqualification. Another approach would be the elimination of boxing.\r"

It is the only \"sport\" in which victory is determined by the amount of physical damage done to the opponent. We have presented the largest number of professional and amateur boxers (58) evaluated by various modern diagnostic modalities and have unequivocally demonstrated the deleterious effects of boxing upon the brain. There have been few, if any, meaningful actions taken by the promoters of boxing to correct the conditions under which boxers are subjected to physical abuse. Recommendations regarding the creation of a National Board of Boxing to supervise this \"sport\" have not been heeded. Suggested safeguards for the boxer, including mandatory medical and boxing history records (passports), use of headgear and approved safe boxing gloves, avoiding blows to the head, improved boxing ring floors, mandatory neurologic examinations, and more competent physicians at ringsides making medical decisions, have essentially not been implemented. The suggestions that mandatory computed tomograms at various stages in a boxer's career be used to determine possible changes of atrophy have not been followed, even when the CT scans have been made available at no cost to the boxers. The effective use of neuropsychologic evaluation, even when offered at no cost, has also been denied. The established medical injuries due to boxing and the lack of any sustained and significant efforts on the part of organized boxing create an atmosphere that is conducive to following the call for the consideration of a ban of boxing.\r"

The authors believe that the cases presented illustrate the increased diagnostic accuracy offered by performing arthroscopy of the knee under local anesthetic in certain types of cases. We are by no means advocating that all arthroscopies of the knee be performed under local anesthesia. Certainly, the majority of knee arthroscopies need not be performed under local anesthesia, because the diagnosis is usually evident. Perhaps when the diagnosis is not clear, a combination of local with regional or with general would be best, with performance of the diagnostic portion of the arthroscopy under local anesthesia. When an instantaneous improvement is possible, such as change in joint motion, or when some change in joint dynamics may be visualized, local should then be continued through the therapeutic conclusion of the procedure. Arthroscopy under local anesthesia has also been performed by the authors on the shoulder, elbow, and ankle, where the diagnostic benefits have been realized. Certain reconstructive operations, such as patellar realignments, are worthy of performance under local anesthesia in selected cases. In conclusion, the authors believe that arthroscopy of the knee and other joints under local anesthesia may add measurably to the diagnostic capability of the arthroscopist, and not infrequently to a therapeutic advantage.\r"

Less hemarthrosis also lowers the level of postoperative pain and the risk of postoperative infection.

Inborn metabolic errors that are accompanied by derangement of metabolic pathways of glucose, pyruvate, amino acids, and organic acids as well as toxic and systemic conditions that promote tissue hypoxia or mitochondrial injury result in lactic acidosis.

Contracture testing of muscle obtained from the patient's mother was positive, while a sibling's test was negative. This case is the first to demonstrate susceptibility to MH with KDS by using physiologic contracture testing. The presence of positive MH results in both the patient and his mother suggest one of the following: (1) KDS may be part of the spectrum of autosomal dominantly inherited MH; (2) the locus for MH and for KDS may be linked closely and inherited concurrently, or; (3) the association of MH and KDS may be coincidental.\r"

A genetic substrate is present in at least some affected families; there also is clearly a genetic relationship between Tourette syndrome and chronic motor tic disorder. Patients with Tourette syndrome have an increased incidence of behavior problems, attention deficit disorder, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Treatment of the attention deficit disorder with psychostimulant drugs will exacerbate tics in some patients. Haloperidol remains the most consistently useful therapeutic agent. Pimozide and clonidine also may be useful, but further work is required before standard treatment protocols can be developed. The disorder most likely results from dysfunction of dopaminergic systems.\r"

The procedure was standardized for agarose isoelectric focusing (AIF) using 5 microliter specimens containing 125 ng of IgG. Oligoclonal bands were found in the CSF of 12% of the patients; bands were found simultaneously in the CSF and serum of 10% of the patients, mostly those with nervous system infections, but also those with central nervous system tumors, seizures, or migraine. In about 50% of positive cases, oligoclonal bands constituted the only CSF abnormality, reflecting an abnormal humoral immune response within the CSF-central nervous system compartment. Avidin-biotin AIF can be recommended as an integrated part of routine CSF examinations in children.\r"

Whether the hypoxic vasoconstriction occurs directly in a localized vascular site with distinct biochemistry or whether it is mediated by a local hormone has not been resolved. Progress has been made because of the introduction of micropuncture techniques that allow direct pressure measurements in small segments of the lung vascular tree. Measurements of the force of contraction and membrane potential (118) and manipulation of the environment of pulmonary microvessels are the most recent progress in the elucidation of the mechanism of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Elements of energy, oxygen, and lipid metabolism appear to contribute to the biochemistry of this elusive response.\r"

Several innovative ways of using shunts have been described to preserve blood flow to the transplanted kidney during such surgery on the assumption that temporary warm ischemia of the renal transplant is poorly tolerated. We have performed aortic surgery in four renal transplant recipients without the use of any form of graft protection. One patient underwent urgent operation to treat an expanding aortic aneurysm and the other three had elective surgery for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Ischemic times ranged from 30 to 45 minutes. Two of the four patients had a temporary rise in serum creatinine levels. No patient required hemodialysis. We conclude that in selected renal transplant recipients, aortic surgery can be safely undertaken without graft protection.\r"

  ".W": "Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are rare, usually benign, neoplasms of the extra-adrenal paraganglion system. They are almost always nonfunctional. The diagnosis is generally confirmed by an angiogram that shows a vascular tumor enlarging the space between the internal and external carotid arteries. A 55-year-old man with hypertension and episodes of flushing, palpitations, and dizziness was treated for a firm, nonmobile mass measuring 3 x 2 cm at the left carotid bifurcation. Plasma and urine catecholamines, and the vanilylmandelic acid/creatinine ratios were elevated. Carotid arteriograms showed a vascular mass displacing the vessels, but the space between the arteries was narrowed rather than enlarged, and an atherosclerotic plaque was present. At operation the CBT was removed by resection of the bifurcation and with a temporary shunt a saphenous vein graft was inserted between the common and internal carotid arteries. Pathologic examination revealed a typical paraganglionoma. Although most CBTs produce catecholamines, only 11 patients have been reported to have elevated plasma and urine levels, and most were symptomatic. Since these tumors slowly increase in size, early surgical removal is recommended, even in asymptomatic patients.\r"

We report a case of a gunshot wound patient who had an 8 cm abdominal aortic false aneurysm, as well as a high-flow arteriovenous communication between the superior mesenteric artery and vein, which were successfully treated by a combination of aorto-superior mesenteric bypass and postoperative percutaneous transcatheter embolization.

Twelve hours after administration, the free (nonlatent) activities of cathepsins D and H were higher in ethanol-fed rats than in glucose-fed controls, indicating a slightly higher lysosomal fragility which probably resulted from a nutritional deficiency which was evident in ethanol-fed animals. Measurement of the total (latent plus nonlatent) activities of these cathepsins in detergent-treated homogenates revealed that only cathepsin H activity in ethanol-fed rats was higher than in controls. The results indicate that acute ethanol consumption causes little or no change in the total activities of the cathepsins examined. Thus previously-reported alterations in hepatic protein catabolism following ethanol administration are not related to changes in the activities of these lysosomal proteases.\r"

Various parameters of nutrition were assessed in chronic alcoholics with and without the commonly associated selective atrophy of type II skeletal muscle fibres, to determine if malnutrition is related to the muscle injury. Serum alkaline ribonuclease activity, a marker of protein nutritional status, was significantly higher in chronic alcoholics compared to controls, suggesting some degree of overall protein malnutrition. However there was no significant difference in this enzyme activity between alcoholics with and without atrophic muscle biopsies. Deficiencies of one or more of thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, Vitamin B12 and folate were found in half of the chronic alcoholics. There was no preponderance of such vitamin deficiencies among those patients with atrophic muscle biopsies. It is concluded that the quadriceps type II fibre atrophy is accompanied by a generalised decrease in skeletal muscle mass and that it is not primarily related to the patient's nutritional status.\r"

In 18 blood samples, taken within 6 hr after alcohol ingestion, blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was determined enzymatically. Concomitantly breath analyses were performed. In general, both methods gave similar results. Peak concentration and area under the blood alcohol curve increased with increasing dose. With the same amount of ethanol, peak concentration and area under the curve tended to be greater in women than in men. Consumption of a meal had an attenuating effect. The area under the curve was smaller after a high-energy meal than after a low-energy meal. Peak concentration depended on meal composition, increasing in the order high protein less than high sucrose = high complex carbohydrate less than high fat. A similar trend was observed for the area under the blood alcohol curve.\r"

The results show that ethanol (1.0 X 10(-4)-1.0 M) depresses neuromuscular transmission, by reducing the amplitudes of both directly and indirectly elicited twitch and tetanic contractions. Ethanol produces a greater reduction in the amplitude of indirectly- than directly-elicited twitch tension and the mean concentration of ethanol which produced a 50% reduction was 38 mM. High concentrations of ethanol (greater than 10(-3) M) completely blocked the indirectly-elicited twitch tension in 4 min exposure. Ethanol also reduced the tetanic tension and increased the PTP value. There was no tetanic fade in the presence of ethanol, but the peak tetanic tension was reduced by 20-50%. It is suggested that ethanol inhibits neuromuscular transmission in the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation, possibly via a mixture of pre- and postjunctional mechanisms and produces a greater reduction in the twitch than tetanic tension.\r"

Study 1 (N = 96) investigated alcohol related expectancies and social desirability as predictors of habitual alcohol use. Higher habitual alcohol use was correlated with higher expected dominance, but this correlation was not modified by social desirability or subject sex. Study 2 (N = 88) tested effects of personality traits on habitual alcohol use. Habitual alcohol use was positively correlated with EPI extraversion. Examination of extraversion sub-factors suggests that impulsivity and sociability independently predict drinking. The data indicate the strengths and limitations of alcohol related expectancy as an explanatory construct.\r"

In both groups, cationic ferritin was observed to traverse the round-window membrane through pinocytotic vesicles into the scala tympani. After establishing that the transport capabilities of the round-window membrane of the monkey remained present one hour after death, cationic ferritin was placed for one hour in the round-window niche of two humans who had been dead for 30 minutes and one hour. The tracer was observed to traverse the round-window membrane through pinocytotic vesicles into the scala tympani in both humans. This report may be the first to document morphologically the permeability of human round-window membranes to macromolecules.\r"

Moderate cytotoxic activity was found in 17 of 27 samples (mean cell death of 53% and 32% at 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions, respectively). In ten (37%) of the middle ear effusion aspirates no cytotoxic activity was detected. To confirm that cytotoxicity was due to TNF, 13 of the samples with cytotoxic activity were incubated with a monoclonal anti-TNF antibody and retested. Cytotoxicity was blocked by the anti-TNF antibodies in all cases. Tumor necrosis factor, derived most probably from macrophages or mast cells in the middle ear, may mediate various pathologic processes associated with otitis media, such as generation of mucoid effusion, fibroblast proliferation, and bone resorption.\r"

As a part of the choanal polyp, the antral cyst exhibited a macroarchitecture and microarchitecture identical to the structure of the common intramural cyst of the maxillary sinus as studied in nine patients. It is concluded that the choanal polyp develops from the expanding intramural cyst protruding through the maxillary ostium and into the nasal cavity.\r"

A hypothesis for the formation of nasal polyps is described: macrophages, seen in allergic and infectious reactions, produce and release growth factors, tentatively including insulinlike growth factor I. In enclosed paranasal sinuses this results in an accumulation of insulinlike growth factor I stimulating the growth of both epithelium and blood vessels in the sinuses. The mucosa increasingly bulges out through the ostium after having filled out the sinusity. Continuing growth stimulation is supplied by the inflammatory reaction, endothelial cells in the polyp, and activated macrophages inside or outside the polyp.\r"

Unfortunately, interstitial tissue pressure is difficult to measure by conventional methods. This article describes a new practical technique that measures interstitial tissue compliance as a correlate of interstitial tissue pressure. The instrument and method are described in detail. Tissue compliance was measured in normal dorsal skin and in modified McFarlane's skin flap in Sprague-Dawley rats. The skin flaps were measured at three sites (proximal, middle, and distal) at 2, 12, and 18 hours of age. The mean difference between the normal skin and all skin flaps was statistically significant. Within the skin flaps, there was a trend toward increased pressure with increasing age of the flap and distance from the flap base. These trends are statistically significant by the analysis of variance test. The data from this study support the validity of the technique and the hypothesis that increased interstitial tissue pressure is present in skin flaps.\r"

Intraoperatively, skin closing tension was compared with and without SMAS plication sutures at the two key anterior and posterior skin anchor points. Results confirmed decreased tension with SMAS plication. Anteriorly in the temporal part of the scalp, a significant difference of 87 g was demonstrated. Posteriorly in the occipital hairline, a significant difference of 96 g was demonstrated. Individual differences in tension were more pronounced in patients with prominent SMAS laxity than in those patients with mild laxity.\r"

Treatment of these injuries requires a six- to eight-week period of intermaxillary fixation, unless rigid internal fixation devices (plates and screws) are used to stabilize the fractures. However, rigid fixation carries the risk of producing a malunion and serious malocclusion if not performed correctly. A review of 22 patients with complex LeFort fractures treated with rigid fixation revealed that the only absolute contraindication to its use is difficulty in interdigitating the maxillary and mandibular teeth in a passive fashion at the time of fracture reduction. Rigid internal fixation should therefore be considered as an alternative treatment for most fractures of the middle third of the face.\r"

The anterior cricoid split procedure was developed as a method of treatment for severe laryngeal stenosis in infants and young children without resorting to a tracheotomy. An analysis of our institution's ten-year experience with 67 patients is presented, detailing the changes in surgical technique that have taken place over that time period. This is contrasted with alternative means of cricoid decompression advocated by other surgeons. Our review supports the efficacy of this procedure when there is strict adherence to certain criteria prior to the performance of the operation. Specifically, this operation should be restricted to neonates or young infants whose pathology is limited to the glottis and subglottis or both, and in whom there is adequate pulmonary reserve.\r"

In the Laennec Hospital (Paris) series of 22 patients, seven shunts are functioning independently. Eleven of 20 inferiorly based flaps stenosed, and all stenoses occurred at the posterior tracheal wall. Technique refinements improved the patency percentage with the seven successes occurring in the last 13 procedures. Four patients in the series had flap necrosis, two of whom had diabetes mellitus and two others extensive paratracheal resections. The technique continues to merit consideration, recognizing that there is a learning curve before success can be anticipated.\r"

Twenty-two tumors recurred at a mean of 9.4 months after rhinectomy; 50% of these patients died. Despite rhinectomy, almost 25% (and 40% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma) died, usually of uncontrolled local disease. Results of surgical reconstruction after total rhinectomy were not satisfactory. In eight of 12 cases, attempts failed primarily or recurrent disease developed. Reconstruction should not be attempted before one year after rhinectomy, and use of a nasal prosthesis is the cornerstone of rehabilitation. Total rhinectomy is an oncologically sound operation for extensive nasal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipid-sensitive, Ca++-dependent protein kinase activity was investigated in the cytosol of melanoma cells. A protein kinase system was partially purified, and enzyme activity was found to be modulated by palmitoyl-carnitine. In order to link the actions of palmitoyl-carnitine on phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase activity and the already reported role of protein kinase C in cell division, we studied the action of palmitoyl-carnitine on melanoma cell growth by measuring colony forming ability in a soft agar culture system. Palmitoyl-carnitine was found to inhibit cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that palmitoyl-carnitine (or long-chain acylcarnitine), a naturally occurring metabolite, may play a key role in the onset of cell division. We suggest that the action of palmitoyl-carnitine on phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activity is in part related to the molecular events linking protein kinase C activity and the ionic events in the initiation of cell growth.\r"

  ".U": "89000542\r", 
  ".W": "Sixteen patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were skin tested with their own serum, IO with autologous plasma and five with serum that had been heated to 56 degrees C to inactivate complement. Eight showed a weal and flare response to whole serum, four to plasma and five to heat-treated serum. All serum-positive patients showed the same response to their own plasma and to heated serum, indicating that the mediator concerned is not generated by clotting and is not dependent on a functioning complement pathway. Three control subjects were negative to autologous serum, plasma and heated serum. Local tachyphylaxis was demonstrated in five serum-positive patients on reinjection of the same site with autologous serum on 3 consecutive days. This raises the possibility that the serological mediator may be acting by mast cell degranulation or directly on receptors in blood vessels and that repeated injections could induce a change in the number of receptors. Passage of whole autologous serum from four serum-positive patients through ultrafiltration membranes showed that fractions with a molecular weight of less than 30,000 daltons were still able to produce a positive skin test response, but those less than 1000 daltons were not. All serum fractions from two serum-negative patients and three normal controls were negative. Whole autologous serum from five serum-positive patients and two control subjects were separated by column chromatography. On skin testing with pooled fractions, the greatest response was produced by fractions of 10,000-15,000 daltons in the serum-positive patients, but there was no response in the controls.\r"

The patients were treated as out-patients using local anaesthesia and all tolerated the treatment well. This study has shown that cryosurgery is a safe, low cost and effective method of treating selected non-melanoma skin cancer and produced excellent cosmetic results with a high cure rate. It is suggested that patients treated with cryosurgery are followed up carefully for 2 years post-operatively.\r"

One group received 4 Gy of Grenz rays administered on six occasions at intervals of 1 week and the other group was given the same Grenz ray treatment plus topical corticosteroid. The patients were assessed before and after Grenz ray therapy and were followed-up for 6 months. Of the 37 patients who completed the trial 16 out of 19 (84%) of the patients in the Grenz ray group, and 13 out of 18 (72%) of the patients in the combination group healed. The remission time did not differ significantly between the two groups. Of the patients who healed, 5 of 16 patients in the Grenz ray only group and 4 of 13 patients in the combination group remained healed at 6 months. We conclude that Grenz ray therapy is a useful treatment modality for scalp psoriasis, but that the addition of a topical corticosteroid has only a minor effect.\r"

Factor B was significantly elevated after treatment with each of the three drugs. C3 levels were significantly increased after treatment, the largest change being in patients treated with clofazimine. In these patients there was also a concomitant decrease in C3d levels.

This increased incidence persisted after the exclusion of previously sterilized women. A total of 11,128 women were sterilized in Aberdeen City and suburbs between 1960 and 1982; 36 ectopic pregnancies occurred in this sterilized population. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy was 3.55/1000 sterilizations. This did not alter significantly over the period of study despite changes in the method of sterilization. However, due to the increased popularity of sterilization, the proportion of ectopic pregnancies in women who had been sterilized increased from 0% in the 1950s to 21% in the quinquennium 1975-1979.\r"

They could thus be useful in treating premature labour. The effect of nitrendipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, on the contractile response of strips of pregnant human myometrium to oxytocin, angiotensin II (AII) and ergometrine has been examined. A total of 68 tissue strips were studied, with random allocation to treatment group. Initial concentration: response curves to one of the three agonists were determined; the concentration:response determinations were repeated in the presence or absence of nitrendipine at 10(-9)M. The initial EC50S for tissues exposed to oxytocin and AII were 8.2 X 10(-10)M and 3.4 X 10(-8)M respectively. The contractile response to both agonists was significantly blunted in the presence of nitrendipine (ANOVA; P less than 0.001 for both agents). This effect was greatest at high agonist concentrations. The initial EC50S for tissues exposed to ergometrine was 3.9 X 10(-8)M. Exposure to nitrendipine blunted the response (ANOVA; P less than 0.001), an effect most marked at low concentrations of ergometrine. The effect of nitrendipine on myometrial responses to the naturally occurring hormones oxytocin and AII supports suggestions of a role for it in inhibiting premature labour.\r"

Although individual patients showed a wide range of mean UAI levels, normal labour (group I, n = 54) was associated with a mean UAI level of 1640 kPas/15 min which was higher than the mean level observed in patients in whom delay in cervical dilatation occurred in active labour. The patients who failed to progress in labour were treated with oxytocin infusion and 32 of them made good progress in labour and achieved vaginal delivery (group IIa: mean UAI pre-oxytocin treatment 1040 (SD 424) kPas/15 min, post-oxytocin 1890 (SD 559) kPas/15 min). The other 23 patients required operative delivery (group IIb) despite correction of uterine activity after oxytocin treatment (pre-oxytocin mean UAI 1230 (SD 570) kPas/15 min, post-oxytocin 1815 (SD 650) kPas/15 min). The rate of oxytocin infusion varied between patients from 2 to 16 mU/min but in 75% uterine activity was corrected to normal levels by a dose of less than or equal to 8 mU/min. It is concluded that delay in progress in labour is associated with lower intrauterine pressures than are present in normal labour, and that management of patients presenting with inefficient uterine action may benefit from the use of uterine activity integral measurements.\r"

Judicious selection of specific oligonucleotides for primers and probes provides type-specific and simultaneous detection of these two retroviruses.

  ".W": "The enhancement of in vitro human hematopoiesis by the addition of a noncytotoxic monoclonal antibody, 9.1C3, is described. Enhancement of all aspects of in vitro hematopoiesis was observed on addition of 9.1C3 antibody to cultures of mononuclear cells from normal bone marrow, cord blood, and peripheral blood from beta-thalassemia major patients. In cultures with no exogenous colony-stimulating factor (CSF), the addition of 9.1C3 resulted in a two- to eightfold increase in nonerythroid colony formation. Similarly, for cultures maximally stimulated with CSF, the addition of 9.1C3 antibody resulted in a one- to fourfold increase in colony formation. These effects were abrogated by the removal of either adherent, Leu-M3+ or Leu-7+ cells. Colony-forming cells were shown to be present among the 9.1C3-negative cells when mononuclear cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Media conditioned in the presence of 9.1C3 and mononuclear cells were able to enhance colony formation in vitro for normal nonadherent bone marrow cells beyond that achieved with supramaximal amounts of human placental-conditioned medium and erythropoietin. The data suggest that natural killer cells interact with monocytes to exert a negative regulatory control on in vitro granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis. Consequently, the number of progenitor and multipotential cells in cultures of unfractionated cell populations may be greatly underestimated.\r"

  ".W": "Of 95 young non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients entered consecutively on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Protocol 7704, 26 (27.4%) had involvement of one or more bones. The mean age of these 26 patients was 16.6 years, and the male to female ratio was 3.3:1. Tumor histology included undifferentiated Burkitt's lymphoma in 12, undifferentiated non-Burkitt's lymphoma in two, undifferentiated, unspecified lymphoma in one, diffuse large cell lymphoma in three, and lymphoblastic lymphoma in eight patients. Most had extensive disease; two patients had isolated bone lesions, one had lesions of two bones without involvement of other tissues, and 23 had either multiple bone lesions or single bone lesions with involvement of other tissues. Eight of the 26 patients had bone marrow involvement. Of a subgroup of 12 patients with jaw disease, 11 had undifferentiated lymphoma and one had diffuse large cell lymphoma. Only one had primary a jaw tumor, with two quadrants of the jaw involved. All 26 patients were treated with chemotherapy; only two received radiotherapy initially for bone lesions. Predicted survival of the 26 patients at 5 years is 53.2%. The 12 patients who remain disease free have a mean survival of 62.1 months (range, 22 to 100 months). Our results call into question the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of bone lesions in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

A third Q.Ab caused binding to 174-, 140-, 93-, and 57-Kd proteins, while a fourth Q.Ab and a Qd.Ab caused IgG binding to 174- and 18-Kd proteins. Using platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia or Bernard Soulier syndrome and purified GPIIIa, these proteins were shown to be GPIb, GPIIb, GPIIIa, GPIX, and an unidentified 57-Kd protein missing in Bernard Soulier syndrome. Binding to the 93-Kd protein was independent of the PIA1 antigen. Absorption of one Q.Ab with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia platelets revealed different populations of antibodies with different specificities within the one patient. Thus Q.Ab and Qd.Ab are heterogeneous and may be directed toward different epitopes on major platelet glycoproteins.\r"

Ninety-one percent of the megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-M) sedimented at densities between 1.070 and 1.080 g/mL. Six percent of CFU-M were found at densities between 1.060 and 1.070 g/mL, 2% between 1.050 and 1.060 g/mL, whereas less than 1% had a density either lower than 1.050 g/mL or higher than 1.080 g/mL. The number of doublings and endomitoses achieved by progenitors of density classes higher than 1.050 g/mL were similar. However, colonies derived from CFU-M of densities less than 1.050 g/mL (LD-CFU-M) had a higher probability of polyploidization and a lower probability of cell division in vitro. The inverse correlation found between the number of cells per colony and their DNA content was invariate regardless of the density class of the progenitors. The heterogeneity of the ploidy of cells within colonies increased continuously with increasing cell numbers per colony. The study if a short-period exposure of LD-CFU-M to acute thrombocytopenia could modify the ploidy of their progeny, mice were given rabbit antimouse platelet serum while control animals received normal rabbit serum. Twenty-four hours after injection, marrow was cultured. After a five-day culture period, no change in the number of colonies, doublings, ploidy, and heterogeneity of ploidy were observed between control and thrombocytopenic animals. The data suggests that LD-CFU-M are a distinct category of CFU-M, perhaps more mature than the common CFU-M.\r"

As expected, approximately half of the Ph' positive acute leukemias showed a breakpoint on chromosome 22 falling outside the \"breakpoint cluster region\" (bcr) known to be involved in CML. Surprisingly, seven of 80 CML cases in chronic phase also showed rearrangements falling outside the bcr region. In two of these cases the breakpoint on chromosome 22 was mapped between 9 and 12 kb upstream to the bcr region. In another case, the breakpoint was located approximately 16 kb downstream to bcr. In the remaining four cases, the precise position of the rearrangement could not be localized with the available bcr probes. DNAs from patients with CML blast crises showed classical bcr rearrangements. No molecular changes were observed during the progression of the disease in six patients whose DNA from both a chronic and acute phase was available. Our results seem to indicate a greater degree of variability of chromosome 22 breakpoints in CML than previously observed, and the lack of additional rearrangements on the Ph' chromosome in CML blast crises with respect to chronic phase.\r"

Since heterodimers immunologically related to platelet GP IIb/IIIa have been identified in a number of nucleated cell types, we tested anti-Leka and anti-PIA1 antiserum, polyclonal anti-platelet GP IIb/IIIa IgG, as well as a panel of 28 monoclonal anti-GP IIb, GP IIIa, or complex dependent anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibodies on endothelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the erythroleukemic cells HEL and K562 in order to determine whether nucleated cell GP IIb/IIIa related proteins and platelet GP IIb/IIIa are immunologically related. Using immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation experiments, evidence is presented that (1) the alloantigen Leka is not expressed in endothelial cells of an individual whose platelets are of the Leka/PIA1 phenotype, whereas the PIA1 alloantigen is readily detectable in these cells, (2) that in contrast to HEL cells, which express platelet GP IIb/IIIa and are of the Leka/PIA1 phenotype, platelet GP IIb is immunologically undetectable in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated K562 cells despite the presence of platelet GP IIIa, and (3) that peripheral blood mononuclear cells do not express platelet GP IIb or GP IIIa on their cell surface.\r"

To define the clinical implications of this finding we have determined genetic, hematological, clinical, and rheological characteristics of sickle erythrocytes obtained from 65 patients with sickle cell anemia and fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels less than 15%. The alpha-globin gene number had a significant effect on the hematological parameters, the percentage of dense cells, ISC number, and HB A2 levels. The presence or absence of alpha thalassemia, however, had no effect on the frequency and severity of the sickle cell painful crisis (r = 0.06, P greater than .05). RBC deformability, determined by an ektacytometer, showed great heterogeneity among patients with three or four alpha-globin genes. Linear regression analyses of the data showed significant positive correlation of the frequency and severity of the painful crisis with RBC deformability (r = 0.49, P less than .001), and negative correlations with the percentage of dense cells (r = -0.37, P = .002), and the percentage of ISC (r = -0.46, P less than .001). We propose that the more deformable the sickle RBC are, the greater their adherence to vascular endothelium, and the more they cause vaso-occlusive crises, RBC deformability and the percentage of dense cells (or ISC) seem to have a predictive value of the frequency and severity of painful crises in sickle cell anemia.\r"

  ".W": "The intracellular distribution of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) was studied in the red cells of a patient with a \"high-ATP syndrome\" by using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. In this patient, red cell ATP was increased 2.5-fold, whereas 2,3-DPG was decreased fourfold due to the presence of a hyperactive pyruvate kinase. In oxygenated red cells, these abnormal concentrations were reflected to the same extent in all complexes in which ATP and 2,3-DPG take part. The diminished amount of 2,3-DPG bound to hemoglobin was almost completely replaced by ATP-hemoglobin complexes. Therefore, free hemoglobin was only slightly increased. In deoxygenated cells, the relative distribution of ATP and 2,3-DPG complexes was significantly disturbed. The main difference was a shift in the ratio of magnesium ATP (MgATP) over the ATP-hemoglobin complex; 74% of total ATP was complexed to hemoglobin (45% in normal cells), whereas the concentration of MgATP was only slightly increased with respect to normal. The shortage in 2,3-DPG bound to hemoglobin could partially be replenished by an increase in hemoglobin (Mg) ATP complexes. Therefore, the amount of uncomplexed hemoglobin raised from 15% in normal cells to 38% in the patient's cells. As a result, the oxygen-dissociation curve was only moderately shifted to the left. It is concluded that the regulatory role of 2,3-DPG in oxygen transport is taken over in part by (Mg) ATP in this patient. In both aerobic and anaerobic cells, the increase in magnesium bound to ATP, either free or bound to hemoglobin, exceeds the decrease in 2,3-DPG Mg complex. In spite of this, the amount of intracellular free Mg++ was normal or slightly lowered. This suggests the presence of a compensatory mechanism by which the amount of total cellular magnesium could be increased.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of immunomagnetic beads to purge human myeloma cells from bone marrow ex vivo was evaluated. The optimal conditions for purging were studied first by using three myeloma cell lines: RPMI-8226, SKO-007, and SKMM-2. Myeloma cells labeled with the vital fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 were admixed with normal bone marrow cells, and two monoclonal antibodies reactive with the myeloma cells (PCA-1 and BL-3) were added alone or in combination with the cells. Magnetic beads coated with goat antimouse immunoglobulin G were then added, and the tumor cells to which beads were attached were separated from the mixture with a magnet. The efficacy of tumor cell removal was dependent on the bead-to-tumor ratio; a ratio of more than 500 was optimal in the presence of excess normal marrow cells. The combination of monoclonal antibodies PCA-1 and BL-3 increased the tumor cell removal as compared with either antibody alone. Two cycles of treatment were more effective than one cycle was. Under optimal conditions, 2.3 to 4 logs of tumor cells could be removed from the mixture containing 10% myeloma cells without a significant loss of normal hematopoietic progenitors as measured by CFU-GM, CFU-GEM, and BFU-E. When the efficacy of this procedure was tested on fresh bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) by using the combination of PCA-1, BL-3, and J-5, 1.6 to 2.5 logs of tumor cells could be removed by one cycle of treatment, even from marrows containing less than 10% myeloma cells. These observations support the use of monoclonal antibody combinations and immunobeads as a reliable and nontoxic method to eliminate contaminating myeloma cells ex vivo in preparation for autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with MM.\r"

  ".U": "89001187\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies documented the abnormal association of heme and heme proteins with the sickle RBC membrane. We have now examined RBC ghosts and inside-out membranes (IOM) for the presence of nonheme iron as detected by its formation of a colored complex with ferrozine. Sickle ghosts have 33.8 +/- 18.2 nmol nonheme iron/mg membrane protein, and sickle IOM have 4.3 +/- 3.0 nmol/mg. In contrast, normal RBC ghosts and IOM have no detectable nonheme iron. The combination of heme and nonheme iron in sickle IOM averages nine times the amount of membrane-associated iron in normal IOM. Kinetics of the ferrozine reaction show that some of this nonheme iron on IOM reacts slowly and is probably in the form of ferritin, but most (72% +/- 18%) reacts rapidly and is in the form of some other biologic chelate. The latter iron compartment is removed by deferoxamine and by treatment of IOM with phospholipase D, which suggests that it represents an abnormal association of iron with polar head groups of aminophospholipids. The biologic feasibility of such a chelate was demonstrated by using an admixture of iron with model liposomes. Even in the presence of tenfold excess adenosine diphosphate, iron partitions readily into phosphatidylserine liposomes; there is no detectable association with phosphatidylcholine liposomes. To examine the bioavailability of membrane iron, we admixed membranes and t-butylhydroperoxide and found that sickle membranes show a tenfold greater peroxidation response than do normal membranes. This is not due simply to a deficiency of vitamin E, and this is profoundly inhibited by deferoxamine. Thus, while thiol oxidation in sickle membranes previously was shown to correlate with heme iron, the present data suggest that lipid peroxidation is related to nonheme iron. In control studies, we did not find this pathologic association of nonferritin, nonheme iron with IOM prepared from sickle trait, high-reticulocyte, postsplenectomy, or iron-overloaded individuals. These data provide additional support for the concept that iron decompartmentalization is a characteristic of sickle RBCs.\r"

  ".U": "89001188\r", 
  ".W": "Many children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develop a marrow relapse during or shortly following initial continuation chemotherapy. Achievement of a second complete remission is the initial step in a successful retreatment effort. Reinduction results using two or three drugs have been unsatisfactory, and previous reports of four-drug reinduction programs have included relatively small numbers of patients. Pediatric Oncology Group protocol 8303 was designed for patients with ALL in first marrow relapse during or within 6 months after cessation of chemotherapy. The results of reinduction therapy in 297 study patients are described here. Four-drug reinduction therapy consisted of daily oral prednisone, weekly vincristine and daunorubicin, and asparaginase three times weekly for 4 weeks (PVDA). CNS retreatment consisted of two doses of triple intrathecal chemotherapy. Of the 297 patients receiving reinduction, 245, or 82%, entered second complete remission, six died of infection or progressive disease, and 46 others still had M2 or M3 bone marrow status. Forty of these latter patients received four doses (during a 2-week period) of teniposide and cytarabine, after which 13 (32%) achieved complete remission status. Thus, the overall second complete remission rate with PVDA with or without teniposide/cytarabine was 258 of 297, or 87%. The treatment program was generally well tolerated. Among the numerous factors analyzed by using logistic regression, only female sex (P = .035), the presence of blasts on the blood smear at the time of relapse (P = .0002), and a length of initial complete remission less than 12 months (P = .021) were independent predictors of failure to enter second remission. We conclude that the intensive reinduction program described here is a highly effective first step in the delivery of salvage therapy to patients with ALL in first marrow relapse. The current challenge is to develop improved continuation treatment for these children.\r"

Indications for HDAC therapy were progressive pancytopenia in 13 patients or rising blast count in four. Five patients died of marrow hypoplasia following therapy. Four others had refractory t-ANLL and died within the subsequent 5 months. Only one of ten patients with a poor performance status (PS greater than or equal to 2 using the ECOG scale) achieved a complete remission, but all seven patients with a good performance status (PS less than or equal to 1) had a complete remission. Hematologic remissions were achieved in 8 patients (47%) after one (6 patients) or two (2 patients) induction courses and were confirmed by recovery of a 100% normal marrow karyotype in six of the seven patients who were retested. Patients in remission received one to four consolidation courses with HDAC alternating with cytarabine/doxorubicin, but seven relapsed within 8 months (median remission duration, 5 months). In every case, the original chromosomal abnormality reappeared at relapse. HDAC has a high response rate for good-performance patients with t-MDS/t-ANLL, but complete remissions are short even when confirmed cytogenetically and consolidated intensively.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies showed that human blood cells exhibited varying sensitivities to ricin. To investigate the basis for these differences, ricin binding to human hematopoietic cell lines was assessed and correlated with in vitro ricin sensitivities. Resistant mutants were also isolated and characterized. Ricin binding to CEM cells was rapid, time-dependent, and blocked by unlabeled ricin, but not albumin; ricin binding approached saturation at 3 mumol/L. Scatchard analyses showed multiple classes of binding sites, with maximum and minimum Kd values estimated at 1.5 x 10(-8) mol/L and 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/L. At 4 degrees C, membrane-bound ricin dissociated slowly from the cell surface in the presence of unlabeled ricin, but greater than 95% of the surface-bound ricin was removed with 0.1 mol/L lactose. At 37 degrees C, ricin dissociated from the cell surface with biphasic kinetics. Ricin uptake at 37 degrees C increased linearly for 15 to 30 minutes and plateaued at levels representing 12% to 29% of the amount of ricin bound at 4 degrees C, depending on the cell line. Ricin binding at 4 degrees C varied two- to fivefold among hematopoietic cell lines and was reduced approximately tenfold by incubation with lactose. When compared with parent CEM cells, ricin-resistant CEM variants showed a greater than 95% reduction in ricin binding and showed no detectable binding with lactose added. However, these cells were as sensitive as parent CEM cells to an anti-T-cell ricin immunoconjugate. For all cells examined, there was a close correlation (r = +.9) between ricin bound per cell and in vitro ricin sensitivity. Human hematopoietic cells show widely varying ricin binding, indicating major differences in the carbohydrate content or structure of surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. These variations are probably the major determinant of nonspecific toxicity of ricin immunoconjugates.\r"

Both macroscopic and microscopic measurements revealed that increasing concentrations of the drug correspondingly decreased the reaction rate between platelets at the surface, thereby reducing thrombus rate of growth at the surface. Because of decreased platelet/platelet adhesion, there was some embolization of the larger thrombi near the inlet of the reactive surface. In the presence of GT-12, average thrombus size and number of platelets per thrombus were both strikingly lowered. In addition, the net rate of growth of individual thrombi decreased to zero after short exposure times (about 60 seconds), in sharp contrast to controls. In contrast to chlorpromazine, GT-12 was effective in inhibiting platelet aggregation and thrombus rate of growth at relatively low concentrations (less than 100 mumol/L) in whole blood. The drug's effectiveness relative to controls in impeding platelet/platelet interactions was found to increase with decreasing incubation time and increasing perfusion time.\r"

The inactivation of APC in normal and in PCI-depleted plasma was similar in the absence of heparin. The addition of heparin did not change the rate of inactivation of APC in PCI-depleted plasma, whereas in normal plasma a rapid phase of inhibition of APC was followed by a slower phase of inhibition. The slower phase was identical to the rate of inhibition of APC in the absence of heparin. After incubation of normal plasma with a monoclonal antibody specific for PCI that blocked its activity, there was no difference in heparin-dependent or heparin-independent inhibition of APC. These results indicate that in the absence of heparin PCI is unable to inactivate APC in a plasma environment.\r"

  ".U": "89001209\r", 
  ".W": "Recent biochemical studies have led to the identification of abnormal spectrins in the erythrocytes of patients with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) and hereditary elliptocytosis (HE). In this report we describe the biochemical characterization of the erythrocytes from a proband with severe HPP who is doubly heterozygous for two mutant spectrins (Sp): Sp alpha I/74 and a new, previously undetected, mutant of alpha-spectrin designated Sp alpha I/61. The proband's erythrocytes are unstable when exposed to 45 degrees C, and her membrane skeletons exhibit instability to shear stress. The content of spectrin in the proband's erythrocyte membranes is decreased to 75% of control values. The amount of spectrin dimers in crude 4 degrees C spectrin extracts is increased (58%) as compared with control values (6% +/- 4%). Limited tryptic digestion reveals a marked decrease in the normal 80,000-dalton alpha I domain, an increase in the 74,000-dalton fragment that is characteristic of Sp alpha I/74, and an increase in a series of new fragments of 61,000, 55,000, 21,000, and 16,000 daltons. Both parents are asymptomatic, but they have increased amounts of spectrin dimers (17% to 25%). Limited tryptic digestion of the father's spectrin demonstrates the presence of a previously identified abnormal spectrin (Sp alpha I/74) that is characterized by a decrease in content of the 80,000-dalton peptide and an increase in concentration of the 74,000-dalton peptide. The mother's spectrin digests show a decrease in the amount of 80,000-dalton peptide and the formation of new peptides of 61,000, 55,000, 21,000, and 16,000 daltons. The data indicate that this severe form of HPP is due to the inheritance of two distinct abnormal spectrins, Sp alpha I/74 and a new spectrin mutant, Sp alpha I/61.\r"

Even when patients had been venesected to give very low total plasma iron concentrations and high transferrin iron-binding capacity, bleomycin-detectable iron was still present at low concentrations. Bleomycin-detectable iron can stimulate damaging free radical reactions, and its persistence in plasma even after prolonged venesection might contribute to the tissue damage that results from iron overload.\r"

Rupture had occurred in 183, 15 underwent urgent operation for intact aneurysm, and 84 had elective surgery. The incidence of rupture increased from 13 to 21 per 100,000 population during the 6-year period. Operative mortality for patients with rupture was 54.7 per cent, but the mortality overall was 81.4 per cent. In 59 per cent of patients with rupture no operation was performed, and 35.0 per cent of all deaths occurred in the community. The mortality for rupture in women was significantly higher than in men, although the operative mortality was comparable. Fifty patients (27 per cent) were found to have attended hospital within 2 years of rupture and many had documented evidence of an aneurysm. One-third of all patients admitted with rupture were undiagnosed. This study complements the previous small number of community studies and suggests that the incidence of rupture is increasing nationally particularly in women, where the mortality was exceptionally high. Early elective surgery is the key to the problem and improved clinical awareness could save many patients without elaborate and expensive programmes to screen the 'at risk' population.\r"

Ankle pressures were measured before and after 4 min of arterial occlusion above the knee. The 95 per cent confidence limits for a postocclusion reduction in pressure was approximately +/- 25 mmHg and for the postocclusion ankle-brachial ratio was +/- 20 per cent. The corresponding figures for the mean of four measurements taken by two observers on 2 days was approximately +/- 17 mmHg and +/- 13 per cent. In patients with vascular disease analysis of variance showed that the greatest sources of variation in the postocclusion ankle-brachial ratio were the 'biological' variations between subjects and between legs. But for postocclusion reductions in pressure, variability due to observers and repeat readings was as important as the 'biological' differences between subjects and legs. Thus, in respect of variability, the ratio may be a better parameter to detect differences between subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA ploidy pattern of gastric cancer was studied in 58 patients to investigate the heterogeneity between primary tumour and metastases. In both primary tumours and lymph node metastases, diploid patterns accounted for 33 per cent, whereas all liver metastases were aneuploid. The percentage of polyploid cells was higher in the liver metastases than in primary tumours and lymph node metastases. When the heterogeneity of DNA ploidy pattern between primary tumour and metastasis was evaluated, diploid tumours had a significantly lower rate of lymph node metastasis heterogeneity than aneuploid tumours. When the DNA ploidy pattern and survival were evaluated, the patients who had a diploid pattern in both primary tumour and metastasis had a significantly higher survival rate than the patients who had an aneuploid pattern in the primary tumour and metastasis (57 per cent versus 26 per cent at 5 years). These data suggest that cell heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in gastric cancer, and this may be important in the evolution of the disease. Furthermore, the role of the DNA ploidy pattern as a prognostic factor is emphasized.\r"

  ".U": "89001893\r", 
  ".W": "From a retrospective analysis of 180 surgical interventions for soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs and trunk, it was concluded that complete excision of the tumour can usually be achieved without sacrifice of major artery, vein, nerve or bone. In this series five major arteries were resected but only one required reconstruction. None of six resected major veins or seven resected nerves were reconstructed. Bone resection in the limb required plating in only two of eleven patients who had limb-sparing resection (there were nine amputations). Both in the limbs and the thorax, resection of bone often involved such a wide excision of the superficial soft tissues as to require a flap repair: four were used in the limbs and three in five chest wall resections. In the majority of operations (140/180) primary wound closure was possible. After 15 procedures for tumour predominantly involving the superficial tissues, split skin grafts were used. These were generally successful (13/15), even occasionally when high-dose radiotherapy had been given. In 16 cases earlier radiotherapy influenced the decision to use a flap repair. A total of 18 flap repairs were performed. In various situations Mersiline mesh (Ethicon, Ltd., UK), Silastic implants and omental swings were used. Wound breakdown in heavily irradiated tissues presented a major challenge for reconstruction. Although major reconstruction was required in only 27 operations (15 per cent), a thorough knowledge of the available methods of reconstruction and repair is essential to allow uninhibited resection with an optimal aesthetic and functional result.\r"

Patients received either 20 mg nefopam (n = 23) or matching placebo (n = 26), 90 min before surgery, immediately after surgery, and 6, 12 and 18 h after the end of surgery. The 24-h morphine requirements were measured using a patient-controlled analgesia system delivering on-demand intravenous bolus doses of morphine. Pain was assessed using visual analogue scales. Patients receiving nefopam had a mean (+/- s.e.m.) cumulative morphine consumption of 4.1 +/- 0.8 mg in the first hour, compared with 8.5 +/- 0.8 mg in the control group (P less than 0.01). After 24 h the consumptions were 44.1 +/- 7.2 mg and 62.5 +/- 6.9 mg respectively (P less than 0.05). The pain scores in both groups were similar. This study confirms that nefopam hydrochloride has significant analgesic effects and would be a useful supplement to morphine in the management of postoperative pain.\r"

Patients who received oral antibiotics alone (group A) had significantly higher risks of postoperative sepsis when compared with patients in either group B or group C (P less than 0.05). As there is no additional advantage of combining oral and systemic antibiotics, we recommend systemic metronidazole and gentamicin to be used with mechanical bowel preparation in elective colorectal surgery.\r"

Of 19 patients who required surgical repair of an obstetric sphincter tear some months or years after injury, 9 (47 per cent) had evidence of pudendal nerve damage at pre-operative anorectal physiological investigation. The result of surgical repair was excellent or good in eight of the ten patients in whom there was no evidence of nerve damage, while this was the case in only one of the nine patients with nerve damage. These results are significantly different (P = 0.018). Thus the functional result of delayed anal sphincter repair after obstetric lesions is partly dependent upon whether the nerve supply is intact. Pre-operative physiological evaluation can give information on the probability of a successful surgical result.\r"

The association of transfusion with infections was highly significant (P less than 0.0001) after controlling for age, sex, blood loss, procedure, tumour differentiation, stage, admission haematocrit, duration of surgery, length of the specimen and tumour size. Blood transfusion appears to be an independent risk factor for postoperative infectious complications.\r"

Over a 3-year period, 20 elderly high-operative-risk patients with stones in the common duct and intact biliary tree were treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy leaving the gallbladder in situ. Two patients underwent cholecystectomy for persistent symptoms after endoscopic sphincterotomy, and 18 patients were discharged from hospital, with the gallbladder intact. Of the 18 patients, 6 developed recurrent gallbladder problems, with 3 of the 6 dying as a result of these problems. On review of our data, these six patients were in a group of eight who, at the time of original endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), were shown to have an obstructed cystic duct. The other 10 patients, with a patent cystic duct and discharged with gallbladder in situ, remained symptom free over a median follow-up period of 9 (range 2-42) months. We conclude that if the gallbladder does not fill at ERC (indicating probable cystic duct obstruction), cholecystectomy is warranted. When the gallbladder fills, regular follow-up alone is justified in the absence of symptoms.\r"

Five patients had papillary stenosis, three had postoperative CBD strictures, one had a choledochal cyst and one had an external biliary fistula. Of the 100 CBDs measuring more than 10 mm in diameter, 90 harboured calculi. In the remaining 23 CBDs measuring less than 10 mm, calculi were present in 21. The presence of CBD calculi was demonstrated by intra-operative cholangiography in 49 patients. In the remaining patients (n = 74), the diagnosis of CBD pathology was made either by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, T-tube cholangiography or peroperative palpation. The surgical procedures performed included choledochotomy and T-tube drainage (n = 74), transduodenal sphincteroplasty (n = 27) and choledochoduodenostomy (n = 18). The overall mortality and morbidity of CBD exploration was 3.3 per cent and 24.4 per cent respectively, which was significantly greater than that for cholecystectomy alone (0.3 per cent and 8.6 per cent respectively). Transduodenal sphincteroplasty carried a much higher mortality (11 per cent) and morbidity (52 per cent) when compared with other procedures.\r"

We propose a simple classification system for breast-conserving procedures, which can facilitate the communication between surgeons and the interpretation and exchange of scientific data.

A diaphragmatic hernia was found in 24 cases (14.7 per cent). Fourteen of these were diagnosed during the initial admission (mortality 7.1 per cent) and the remaining ten were diagnosed during a subsequent admission (mortality 30 per cent). The initial chest radiograph was diagnostic of diaphragmatic injury in 13 per cent, abnormal but not diagnostic in 76 per cent, and completely normal in 11 per cent. The importance of early diagnosis in reducing mortality, morbidity and hospital stay is emphasized. A high index of suspicion, careful clinical examination, and serial chest radiographs remain the best way of making the diagnosis.\r"

The number of bacteria seen in a total of 10 oil immersion microscope fields of Gram-stained homogenates was correlated with significant microbial growth (1 x 10(5) organisms/gram of tissue) of the same biopsy homogenate plated on trypticase soy agar. Of the biopsies examined, Gram-negative rods were present in 36.8 per cent, Gram-positive cocci in 49.7 per cent and yeast in 15.9 per cent. Mixtures of organisms were present in 24.3 per cent. When Gram stains showed one or more organisms per oil immersion microscope field, the correlation with significant microbial growth was 94.5 per cent or more. When five or more organisms were seen per field, the correlation with significant growth became 97 per cent or greater. When no organism was seen on Gram stain, the cultures grew significant numbers of organisms 19.1 per cent of the time or less. This false-negative rate was considered to be high. It is believed, however, that this method of early detection of significant burn wound microbial growth may prove to be valuable in the management of severely burned patients.\r"

  ".W": "A 4-year retrospective study of hot tapwater scalds admitted to Mount Vernon Hospital Burns Unit suggested that the three high-risk groups are young children, the elderly and the mentally and physically handicapped. A household survey was conducted of 60 homes inhabited by people over 70 years of age and 60 homes inhabited by families with toddlers to identify what measures could be taken to prevent hot tapwater scalds. The survey showed that over half of the old people did not have adequate bathing aids and that one-third of all the homes visited had a hot tapwater temperature greater than 60 degrees C, which is the temperature recommended by British Building Services Engineers. The survey also revealed that 50 per cent of the immersion heaters and 25 per cent of the gas boiler central heating systems produced an excessively high hot tapwater temperature. The study thus indicated that both the wider provision of bathing aids to the elderly and a nationwide programme to update old inefficient immersion heater and gas boiler central heating systems would reduce the risk of hot tapwater scalds. The installation of a 'thermoscopic' mixing valve, pre-set and locked at 43 degrees C, at bath and shower outlets can totally eliminate the risk of hot tapwater scalds. At present it is not a feasible option to install these valves in every household, but there is a strong case for installing them in hospitals and residential homes for paediatric, geriatric and mentally/physically handicapped patients.\r"

Hot water scalds were the commonest type of injury. Most of the burns occurred at home but coinciding with standard working hours. Children up to 5 years old were commonly affected, but most of the fatal burns were among adults. The overall mortality rate was 7.2 per cent with a male to female ratio of 1.1:1. Our survival rate from burn injuries is improving due to advances in treatment, but prevention remains the best cure. We consider our epidemiological survey to be important as the basis for a preventive programme in Kuwait's extremely heterogeneous society.\r"

The technique employed in the model construction is the system dynamic approach. A five-compartment model has been considered. The control mechanisms incorporated are adequate for describing the interactions between plasma and interstitial fluid and between the extra- and intracellular compartments. With the model we are able to analyse the dynamic behaviour of many variables, for example the plasma, interstitial, extra- and intracellular fluid volumes and the plasma and interstitial proteins in burn and non-burn areas. These values are very difficult to measure in daily clinical practice, although they indicate the actual state of a burn patient. The simulation results are compared with measured values in a series of patients from a burn unit in a general hospital.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that a single hindlimb burn has both local and distant effects. Male CF1 anaesthetized mice were given a full thickness scald burn of 3 per cent total body surface area (BSA) by immersion of their left hindlimb in water at 95 degrees C for 5 s. Muscle tension was measured through twitch analysis. Levels of cyclic adenosine 3'-5' monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine 3'-5' monophosphate (cGMP) were analysed by 125I-radioimmunoassay. Measurements were made in gastrocnemei of the ipsilateral burned and contralateral unburned limbs over a 28-day postburn period. Within 1 week the burned limb showed an increase in both tension and a 100-fold increase in levels of cAMP. However, by the end of the second week muscle tension in the burned limb dropped to one-seventh of control values despite persistence of high levels of cAMP. In contrast, the systemic effects were manifested in the unburned contralateral limb which showed tension to undergo a six-fold compensatory increase at the end of the second week with a 75-fold increase in cAMP. By the end of 4 weeks, tension levels of both burned and unburned limbs were attenuated to one-half control values indicating neuromuscular (NM) dysfunction. Nevertheless, cAMP levels remained elevated in both limbs. Levels of cGMP were reduced throughout the 4-week postburn period. Subsequent to the single hindlimb injury both ipsilateral and contralateral gastrocnemei muscles showed elevated levels of total protein content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
