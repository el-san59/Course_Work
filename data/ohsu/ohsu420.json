Identification of nonvolatile pheromones have been relatively rare, especially in vertebrates. Male and female garter snakes use pheromones to mediate sexual behavior. The female sex attractiveness pheromone of the Canadian red-sided garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, consists of a novel series of nonvolatile saturated and monounsaturated long-chain methyl ketones, whereas the male sex recognition pheromone contains squalene. These compounds were isolated, identified, and partially synthesized, and field tests show them to be biologically active.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of pulmonary blood flow was studied during voluntary diving in the aquatic file snake, Acrochordus granulatus. Measurements of pressure and blood flow in pulmonary and systemic vessels indicate that blood flow completely bypasses the lung for significant periods during prolonged and quiescent submergence (greater than 30 minutes). When the lung is ventilated, pulmonary blood flow increases to 36 milliliters per minute per kilogram of body mass (measured in the anterior pulmonary artery), and the cardiac output largely bypasses the systemic circulation. These reciprocating patterns of preferential blood flow reflect inverse relations between flow and vascular resistance, with the result that systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures remain virtually constant throughout repetitive dive cycles. Neuropharmacological studies of freely diving snakes and isolated, perfused lung preparations show that pulmonary blood flow is regulated by an interplay of adrenergic vasodilatation and cholinergic vasoconstriction within the densely innervated lung vasculature. The patterns of blood circulation shown by diving Acrochordus reflect an unusual lability of intracardiac shunts.\r"

Twenty-nine (6%) of the 513 women tested were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. Twenty-six (90%) of seropositive women gave a history of intravenous drug use. Two (7%) had sexual partners known to have AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC), and one (3%) was Haitian. Seropositive women were at remarkable risk for other sexually transmitted diseases. The majority of pregnancies ended in term births. This serosurvey defines an obstetric population with a high seroprevalence, and has stimulated us to institute routine voluntary antepartum screening for HIV.\r"

They had seven episodes of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and five due to Haemophilus influenzae for rates of 6.5 and 4.6 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively. Children born to American parents were observed for 131.3 patient-years and had three episodes and one episode, respectively, for rates of 2.3 and 0.76 episodes per 100 patient-years. The differences in the overall rate of bacteremia were significant (P less than .015). Leukocyte counts and percentage of erythrocytes with pits, indicating decreased splenic function, were similar for the two groups. The Haitian families had lower annual incomes, but values for both groups were so low that their difference is unlikely to be related to the increased infection rate. Although no cause for the higher rate of bacteremia could be found, the approach to febrile illness in Haitian children with sickle cell anemia should be even more aggressive than usual. In addition to Haemophilus influenzae immunization, antibiotics effective against penicillin-resistant species should be used in the initial antibiotic coverage of their febrile illnesses.\r"

Stool cultures from 19 customers and each of the eight restaurant employees were positive for Salmonella newport. Cultures of a ham slice obtained from the restaurant and a partially consumed pork sandwich obtained from one ill person both grew Salmonella of same serotype.\r"

Atheromatous embolization occurs more commonly than is recognized, and its incidence may be increasing. We report ten cases that demonstrate the variability in presentation and prognosis. These data and a review of the existing literature suggest an extremely grave prognosis in patients with generalized organ system involvement, as opposed to those patients with involvement of the lower extremity only. Treatment consists of general supportive care. Anticoagulation or lytic therapy appears to be of no benefit, and may actually contribute to embolization. We discuss new pharmacologic agents as possible treatment for the intense local ischemia, and recommend selective use of lumbar sympathectomy in cases of impending loss of lower extremity tissue.\r"

This method revealed no significant trends for infants of weight groups less than 500 gm or 500 to 999 gm. Analysis of birthweight-specific admissions as a proportion of total NICU admissions revealed significant increases for all birthweight groups of less than 2,000 gm, with decreases in admissions for infants weighing more than 2,000 gm. Analysis of mortality data revealed improved survival for infants weighing less than 1,500 gm, but some centers showed increases in neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality, or infant mortality among infants weighing 2,500 gm or more. During this study, low birthweight infants comprised an increasingly larger proportion of neonatal intensive care admissions. This trend evolved gradually through the process of regionalization and can be directly linked to the cost requirements of regional neonatal intensive care units.\r"

In the absence of direct nerve compression (seen in only eight specimens), the most severe neural changes were associated with compression, congestion, and resultant dilatation of foraminal veins. Pathologic changes within and around the nerve root complex included peri- and intraneural fibrosis, edema of nerve roots, and focal demyelination. Inflammatory cells were notably absent. Vascular changes within the thickened fibrous sheath about damaged nerves, namely, basement membrane thickening, suggestive of endothelial cell injury also were observed. The association between vascular compression, tissue fibrosis, and endothelial injury distant from the compression may be causal--probably due to ischemia as a result of reduced venous outflow. Such observations have led the authors to propose that venous obstruction may be an important pathogenic mechanism in the development of perineural and intraneural fibrosis.\r"

However, the pathophysiology underlying various functional changes, including pain production, in such conditions is incompletely known. In this study, the tissue fluid pressure in the DRG of L5 nerve roots of rats was measured before and after compression. Normal values were found to be 3.7 +/- 0.3 cm H2O (2.7 +/- 0.2 mm Hg). After mechanical compression, the endoneurial fluid pressure in the ganglia rose to 9.6 +/- 1.7 cmk H2O (7.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg) (P less than 0.001). Histologic examination revealed edema and haemorrhage in the endoneurial space of the DRG. Pressure increase in the DRG as a result of mechanical deformation by, for example, a herniated disc might be expected to reduce blood flow to the sensory nerve cell bodies in the DRG. This may be a mechanism underlying the production of nerve root pain, which previously has not been described.\r"

Experience of low-back trouble was determined by questionnaire, and categorized as none, a previous history, or a current spell. Maximal mobility was estimated from flexicurve records of back surface curvature. The results for adults revealed that mean mobility values were reduced by both previous and current low-back trouble, particularly in the upper lumbar region, when compared with nonsufferers. Stepwise regression analyses showed that variation in mobility was best accounted for by the cumulative effects of age and sex. These variables accounted for approximately one-third of the variation in mobility: low-back trouble only accounted for an additional 1%. At the extremes of the range, both hypomobility and hypermobility were identified as risk indicators for low-back trouble. Relative hypermobility was not confined to subjects with no history of back trouble; some current sufferers had particularly high levels of mobility. Similarly hypomobility was found in nonsufferers as well as in those with back trouble. The data indicated that young adults (notably males) with previous low-back trouble may not recover their previous mobility on symptomatic resolution. The finding of hypermobility in current sufferers indicates that mobilization therapy may not be appropriate for such patients.\r"

Torque-rotation characteristics were studied with 24 cadaveric lumbosacral-pelvic specimens. The specimens were divided into three groups. In Group A, the \"facet joints,\" lumbosacral disc and the iliolumbar ligament were all intact. In Group B, the \"facet joints\" were removed, and in Group C, both the \"facets\" and the iliolumbar ligament were removed. The results indicated that the ligament was important in maintaining torsional stability of the lumbosacral junction and contributed to 35.2% of the normalized elastic strain energy of the junction.\r"

The nuclear shape in MRI showed a weak correlation with macroanatomy (Kw = 0.31) and general disc degeneration in discography (Kw = 0.32), whereas nuclear intensity in MRI underestimated such changes. Magnetic resonance imaging showed posterior extension of the nucleus in most cases where moderate or severe leaking was seen in discography.

  ".W": "This paper analyzes the initial effect of the Zielke VDS operation on S-shaped idiopathic spinal curves in 17 patients with particular reference to the thoracic spine. The curves are evaluated by conventional methods (Cobb angle, apical vertebral rotation, kyphosis, and lordosis) and by a new method using end vertebra angles (EVAs). Three new surgical correction indices are used. In the lower curve, the surgical correction averaged 81%, and it is usually larger than that induced in the thoracic curve by about 48% (surgical correctability index). The lower curve correction is asymmetric, occurring more in its lower part (lower EVA) than in its upper part (upper EVA), a difference that the authors attribute to the restraint imposed by the rib cage on the upper EVA of the lower curve. In the upper (thoracic) curve, the surgically induced correction is variable and averages 33% (range, 6-69%). It is related significantly to preoperative bending film flexibility. The thoracic curve correction also is asymmetric, occurring more in its lower part (lower EVA) than in its upper part (upper EVA), which usually remains stable. The kyphosis angle decreases by an average of 7 degrees. The thoracic apical vertebral rotation shows variable changes. The findings show that the correction of the upper curve occurs mainly in the thoracolumbar spinal segment. It is suggested that this junctional segment of the spine is of importance in determining the limits of both instrumentation and fusion for idiopathic scoliosis.\r"

  ".W": "Today, repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with interposition prosthetic graft replacement is the only reliable method of preventing aneurysm rupture. The Mayo experience demonstrates that this repair also can be accomplished in high-risk patients with very acceptable morbidity and low mortality rates. However, it must be emphasized that these results are related not only to the surgical procedure itself but also to vigorous perioperative medical support, including intraoperative pharmacologic enhancement of cardiac function, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation if necessary, and intensive postoperative pulmonary management. When resources are available for intensive intraoperative and postoperative support, direct graft repair is the treatment of choice for high-risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.\r"

Based on data obtained from this review and from studies previously published in the literature, the keys to optimal outcome are rapid diagnosis, craniotomy with total removal of pus, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. The clinical syndrome of subdural empyema can overlap that of other intracranial infections; infants and young children present with a different syndrome than older children and adults. Computed tomography scanning is nearly always diagnostic but may be equivocal or normal; magnetic resonance imaging may become the diagnostic study of choice. Multiple organisms are often cultured, which requires multiple drug therapy.\r"

Nevertheless, one of the pitfalls of this approach is cutting of the draining veins combined with retraction. A case of craniopharyngioma in which a subcortical hematoma developed is reported. The divided draining veins and the 60-minute retraction period were thought to have caused this complication. We therefore determined the clinical effect of cutting the draining veins and retraction on the regional cerebral blood flow and the motor nerve action potential. There were marked changes and a hematoma occurred mostly when the veins were divided and retraction was applied over the area.\r"

We suspected that the cause of the subcortical hematoma was dividing the bridging veins and applying a retractor over them. In this paper, we report our experimental study, using dogs and monkeys, to evaluate the effect of cutting the vein and applying a retractor over it. The incidence of a subcortical hematoma was highest (60%) when the veins were cut and the retraction was applied. Vein occlusion only did not cause hematoma to develop, and the retraction alone caused 13% of the hematomas. This clearly indicated that the clinical case reported in Part I developed the subcortical hematoma postoperatively because the frontal bridging vein was cut and a retractor was applied for 60 minutes over the cut vein.\r"

Lowering arterial pressure to keep normal cortical blood flow during and after operation resulted in minimum brain edema and an excellent result.

Three operated brains revealed a posterior shift of the principal transverse sulcus in the ipsilateral hemisphere. This sulcus is remote from the area of excision, which was usually represented by a cystic cavity. Histologic examination showed that the dorsal lateral geniculate body was reduced in size in all but three of the operated brains. In two brains with the changed gyral pattern there was also a reduction in the size of the white fiber tracts of the frontal lobe. No evidence of neural regeneration was found in any of the brains. The implications of these findings from the point of view of possible neurosurgical intervention in the fetus are considered.\r"

The Framingham cohort of 5,184 men and women aged 30-62 years and free of stroke at entry to the study have been followed with periodic examinations since 1950. We studied the silent strokes found on computed tomography scan of all initial strokes that occurred between January 1, 1979, and July 31, 1987. During these 8 1/2 years, 164 initial strokes occurred; 124 had computed tomography scans performed. There were 13 (10%) with silent stroke, 71 had abnormalities related to their presenting acute stroke, and 40 had normal computed tomography scans. There were 15 silent lesions; eight were lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia-internal capsule area, seven were small cortical infarcts. Glucose intolerance was the sole risk factor that occurred significantly more frequently (11 of 13) in the group with silent lesions (p less than 0.04) than in the group with computed tomography evidence of acute stroke. Silent stroke is not rare; it was present in at least 10% of acute initial stroke patients arising in a general population. The relation of these silent lesions to the development of \"vascular\" dementia and poststroke disability deserves further study.\r"

All cases were registered with the study either by notification from general practitioners or by check of hospital admission within the study area and in the two hospitals of Perugia. Death certificates were looked at as well. Patients were registered with the study when the clinical picture fulfilled the definition of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) adopted for this study. Patients were followed up at approximately 30 days and 6 months. During the first year of the study (September 1, 1986 to August 31, 1987), 189 cases were registered: 108 suffered a \"first ever in a lifetime\" stroke, 30 a recurrent stroke, and 51 a \"first ever in a lifetime\" transient ischemic attack. Sixty-one percent of patients (71% of first strokes) had a computed tomography scan. For our study, the crude annual incidence rate of first stroke was 2.2 per 1,000 (confidence intervals 1.81-2.66); the standardized rate to the European population was 1.36 (confidence intervals 1.06-1.74). At least 83% of first strokes were due to cerebral ischemia; in 26 cases a clinical diagnosis of lacunar ischemia was made. The 30-day case fatality rate was 21%; 25% of our patients had recovered completely or almost completely after 1 month.\r"

There were 8,705 people 36 years of age or older interviewed during the period of October 1 to December 31, 1986, and 143 cases of completed stroke were later identified by a neurologist. The point prevalence rate for people aged 36 or older in our study was 1,642/100,000 population (95% confidence interval 1,389-1,942/100,000). Prevalence rates differed significantly among the four study regions and between urban and rural communities; prevalence was greater in northern Taiwan and in urban communities. Percentages of the major types of stroke in 143 stroke survivors were as follows: cerebral infarction 67.1% (96 cases), cerebral hemorrhage 14.0% (20 cases), subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.2% (six cases), and unclassified 14.7% (21 cases). Of the stroke survivors, 67.1% were independent in activities of daily living, and 75.5% were independent in ambulation. Hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and a family history of stroke were significantly more common in stroke survivors than in strokefree individuals.\r"

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid. We discuss methods for improving the reliability and validity of brief examination scales to be used in stroke therapy trials.\r"

Our examination showed hemorrhagic infarct in seven patients and pale infarct in the other seven, contradicting the commonly proposed pathophysiologic mechanism for the development of hemorrhagic infarct that the opening of previously occluded vessels makes an infarct hemorrhagic. Analysis of blood pressure after stroke revealed one or more surges of arterial hypertension or rapid rise of blood pressure in patients with hemorrhagic infarct without a reopening of the occluded artery. Such arterial hypertension was not always present in patients with pale infarct. Hemorrhage into an infarct with persisting occlusion of the proximal artery is assumed to occur when the involved blood vessels are exposed to the force of arterial blood pressure from the leptomeningeal collaterals. This occurs when arterial blood pressure rises after stroke in the presence of efficient leptomeningeal collaterals and before occlusion of these collaterals by a swollen cerebral hemisphere containing a large infarct.\r"

The present study was carried out to evaluate whether this protective effect involves changes in the degree of local cerebral blood flow reductions, tissue accumulation of free fatty acids, or alterations in the extracellular release of glutamate and dopamine. Rats whose intraischemic brain temperature was maintained at 36 degrees C, 33 degrees C, or 30 degrees C were subjected to 20 minutes of ischemia by four-vessel occlusion combined with systemic hypotension. Levels of local cerebral blood flow, as measured autoradiographically, were reduced uniformly in all experimental animals at the end of ischemia by gas chromatography after tissue extraction and separation by thin layer chromatography. A massive ischemia-induced accumulation of individual free fatty acids was observed in animal groups whose intraischemic brain temperature was maintained at either 36 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Extracellular neurotransmitter levels were measured by microdialysis; the perfusate was collected before, during, and after ischemia. In rats whose intraischemic brain temperature was maintained at 36 degrees C, dopamine and glutamate increased significantly during ischemia and the early period of recirculation (by 500-fold and sevenfold, respectively). In animals whose brain temperature was maintained at 33 degrees C and 30 degrees C, the release of glutamate was completely inhibited, and the release of dopamine was significantly attenuated (by 60%). These results suggest that mild intraischemic hypothermia does not affect the ischemia-induced local cerebral blood flow reduction or free fatty acid accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a moderate level of fluid-percussion brain injury on acetylcholine-induced cerebral arteriolar vasodilation was examined for 12 hours after trauma in anesthetized cats equipped with cranial windows. The cats were then perfused with aldehydes, and the pial arteries were prepared for electron microscopy. Immediately after brain injury, the normal vasodilator response to topical application of acetylcholine was converted to vasoconstriction. By 4 hours after trauma, the ability of small pial arterioles (diameters less than 100 microns) to dilate after acetylcholine application had returned to the pretrauma level and was observed to be normal at both 8 and 12 hours after trauma (p less than 0.05). The vasodilator response of large caliber arterioles (diameters greater than or equal to 100 microns) at 4, 8, and 12 hours after injury was reduced relative to the pretrauma response but was significantly improved relative to their response at 30 minutes after trauma (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the response of large vessels at 4, 8, and 12 hours in injured animals was equal to that observed in noninjured control animals assessed at 4, 8, and 12 hours after window implantation. At 12 hours after injury, the ultrastuctural characteristics of both large and small vessels resembled their preinjury state. These data suggest that the impairment of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation observed in cats after fluid-percussion brain injury is not irreversible but returns to normal (small arterioles) or exhibits significant recovery (large arterioles) within 4 hours after injury.\r"

  ".W": "We examined cerebral lipid peroxidation, estimated by a thiobarbituric acid test, in rat brain regions after 30 minutes of severe forebrain ischemia and at recirculation periods of up to 72 hours. The lipid peroxide levels remained unaltered in all brain regions during ischemia and during the first hour of recirculation but were selectively increased between 8 and 72 hours of recirculation in the ischemia-sensitive regions of the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex. The most pronounced increases (30-37%) were seen at 48 hours of recirculation. In contrast, lipid peroxide levels were unchanged in infarcted brain regions 24 hours after intracarotid injection of microspheres, indicating that reoxygenation of the ischemic brain is a prerequisite for lipid peroxidation. We assessed the lipid peroxidation capacity of cerebral homogenates obtained from rats subjected to ischemia and recirculation by measuring the production of lipid peroxides after aerobic incubation. The homogenates from rats exposed to 30 minutes of ischemia or to 1 hour of recirculation were not more susceptible to peroxidation. However, the production of lipid peroxides was selectively increased in the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex at 8-48 hours of recirculation, suggesting a loss of efficacy of the antioxidant systems. These results, showing a delayed and long-lasting increase in lipid peroxidation that occurs in ischemia-sensitive brain regions and parallels the development of neuronal necrosis, support the hypothesis that free radical processes participate in postischemic neuronal damage.\r"

Rats were allowed to survive for periods of up to 4 weeks after the operation, and we focused particular interest on the time course of blood flow changes from the initial ischemic events to the late stage of infarction. Regional blood flow was measured using [14C]iodoantipyrine and a quantitative autoradiographic technique. Blood flow in regions with histologic signs of infarction (i.e., the lateral caudoputamen and adjacent neocortex) was below 0.238 ml/g/min, corresponding to 15% of normal values for those regions. In perifocal regions without infarction such as the medial caudoputamen and globus pallidus, cerebral blood flow was also reduced, but it never declined below 20% of its normal value. The decrease in cerebral blood flow was most marked during the first hours after occlusion. Thereafter, cerebral blood flow values gradually normalized, and at 4 weeks there were no significant differences compared with the contralateral side. The border between cortical regions with hypoperfusion and normal cerebral blood flow was rather sharp in the coronal plane, but in the sagittal plane there was a more gradual transitional region. The region with hypoperfusion, observed in the sagittal plane, was most widespread in the acute stage, and normalization of flow occurred particularly from anterior and posterior cortical regions toward the ischemic focus. The possibility for penumbral conditions in the cortex thus exists, particularly in the anterior and posterior borders of the infarction, and remains for several hours after the initial insult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Selection criteria for the classification of severity of ischemia were established by correlating changes in the electroencephalogram and the general physiological status with measurements of regional blood flow and regional energy metabolism. In 13% of animals, 4VO did not cause flattening of the electroencephalogram, and such animals were classified as undergoing only \"oligemia.\" In 65% of rats, the electroencephalogram flattened and blood pressure sharply increased with 4VO, whereas spontaneous respiration continued. This group exhibited almost complete ischemia in autoradiographic blood-flow studies, severe acidosis, and depletion of adenosine 5'-triphosphate and glucose in the forebrain and, hence, was classified as the \"ischemia\" group. The remaining 22% stopped breathing after vascular occlusion and were rejected for further study. Survival experiments of ischemic animals revealed the typical postischemic sequelae, with primary metabolic recovery after 8 hours of recirculation in all brain structures followed after 8-24 hours by severe biochemical deterioration and neuronal death in the striatum and hippocampus. Postischemic seizure activity was rare. The main advantages of the present modification in comparison with the original method are 1) the application of anesthesia without loss of primary selection criteria, 2) the possibility of invasive physiological monitoring, and 3) the absence of postischemic seizures, which eliminates the necessity for secondary selection criteria.\r"

However, relatively few studies have been carried out on the rheologic behavior of leukocytes in vascular diseases. This study aimed at quantifying the filterability through Nuclepore filters (mean pore diameter 5 microns) of both leukocyte subpopulations and red blood cells in patients with acute stroke compared with age-matched healthy controls. Leukocytes were separated by density into polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells. Filterability of the red blood cells and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear subpopulations in buffer was measured using a constant-flow and low-positive pressure system. We used one-way analysis of variance, signed rank sum, and simple and multiple regression tests for statistical analysis. Twenty consecutive male patients with acute ischemic infarction were compared with 20 age-matched healthy subjects. Mononuclear cell filterability was impaired in acute stroke (7.26 +/- 2.00) compared with the controls (5.55 +/- 1.23) (p less than 0.01). Polymorphonuclear cell filterability was less, but still significantly (p less than 0.05), impaired in acute infarction (5.75 +/- 0.87 vs. 4.19 +/- 0.43). The results show that leukocyte and, especially, mononuclear cell filterability is impaired in acute infarction, while no differences exist in red blood cell filterability.\r"

  ".W": "DNA probes that detect polymorphic loci in the human genome are finding widespread application in many areas of genetic testing. Paternity testing represents one area for the application of probe technology; this report presents data obtained in a paternity testing program with a probe (pa3'HVR) derived from a locus (D16S85) approximately 8 kilobases (kb) downstream from the alpha globin gene complex on chromosome 16. The pa3'HVR probe used under stringent conditions of hybridization detects a highly polymorphic locus in chromosomal DNA digested with Pvu 2 restriction endonuclease. Alleles at the D16S85 locus were grouped into 58 size bins differing from one another by 100 base pairs in the black and white populations. The most common alleles detected in whites fell into the 2.3-kb group with a collective frequency of 0.1849. In blacks, the most common allele group is 2.0 kb with a collective frequency of 0.1333. The probe was used for restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping in conjunction with standard paternity testing techniques in 100 paternity cases. Thirty direct exclusions were encountered in the 100 cases with standard testing methods, versus 27 exclusions with the pa3'HVR probe alone. Four exclusions detected with standard methods were not detected with the probe and one exclusion detected with the probe was missed by standard testing. The probability of excluding a falsely accused man by use of the pa3'HVR probe was approximately 90 percent. In cases where exclusions were not encountered, the data obtained with the pa3'HVR probe increased the paternity index calculated from standard testing by about 16-fold.2+ informative for paternity testing.\r"

After avoidance of interspecies reactions, chimpanzee red cells were found to react with most Kell system antibodies. The chimpanzees had phenotypes similar to those of humans. The main difference was that all of 27 chimpanzee red cell samples tested were of the K:6, -7, phenotype, while in humans most are K:-6, 7. The most common chimpanzee Kell blood group phenotype was K:-1,2,-3,4,5,6,-7,11,12,13,14, 15,18,19,22. Murine monoclonal anti-K2 and -K14 immunoprecipitated a 97-kD protein from chimpanzee red cells and a 93-kD protein from human red cells. Enzymatic deglycosylation yielded proteins of about 79 kD for humans and 77 kD for chimpanzees. Both human and chimpanzee Kell proteins reacted equally well on Western blots with polyclonal rabbit antibody to human Kell protein, which indicated close homology.\r"

  ".W": "There is abundant evidence of immune modulation induced by exposure to blood transfusions. Some studies have demonstrated a detrimental effect of transfusion on the recurrence of malignant disease and survival. We retrospectively studied the impact of blood transfusion exposure on 229 patients with breast cancer who were seen from July 1973 to September 1980, had at least 5 years' follow-up and had been randomized by therapy at the time of diagnosis. The patients were divided into four groups according to transfusion history: Group 1 (111 patients), no transfusion; Group 2 (34 patients), first transfusion after mastectomy; Group 3 (41 patients), first transfusion at mastectomy; and Group 4 (43 patients), first transfusion before mastectomy. All transfused patients received red cells or whole blood or both. At the time of analysis, 124 (54%) of the patients had died. Only Group 2 was statistically associated with decreased survival; recurrence of disease was 85 percent in this group, compared with 53 percent to 61 percent in the other three groups (p = 0.006, log-rank test). In general, Group 2 patients received transfusions because of recurrent disease. We conclude that transfusions before or at mastectomy are not associated with increased recurrence or reduced survival in patients with breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "When red cells (RBCs) are treated with papain, one form of the U antigen, which we have named UPS (U papain-sensitive), is almost completely removed or denatured. A second form, UPR (U papain-resistant), remains unaltered on the treated RBCs. Tests on 42 examples of anti-U showed that two contained only anti-UPS, 19 contained only -UPR, and 21 contained separable -UPS and -UPR. In those sera containing both antibodies, anti-UPR was always the stronger of the two. These findings suggest 1) that UPS is located on the Ss sialoglycoprotein (glycophorin B) at a position distal to a papain-sensitive site or that the cleavage point is within the portion of the SGP that comprises UPS, and 2) that UPR is located between the papain-sensitive site and the RBC membrane. The UPS determinant was not denatured by neuraminidase, L-cysteine, trypsin, ficin, or alpha-chymotrypsin, and it was only partially denatured by pronase. The finding that RBCs treated with para-chloromercuribenzoic acid or para-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid did not react with anti-UPR but did continue to react with anti-UPS suggests that the in situ configuration of UPR, but not UPS, is dependent on the presence of one or more disulfide bonds. RBCs of the S-s-U+(weak) phenotype were shown to carry markedly reduced amounts of both UPS and UPR.\r"

  ".U": "89318450\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study, the frequency with which ABH incompatibility could be detected in platelet crossmatches was determined. The effect of chloroquine elution on ABH antigens was also evaluated, and a technique was developed to remove IgG anti-A from group O plasma using a chemically synthesized human blood group A trisaccharide antigen covalently linked to crystalline silica (Synsorb-A). Group O plasmas were found to be incompatible with 52 percent of group A platelets and 17 percent of group B platelets (p less than 0.05). In contrast, anti-A from group B plasmas rarely produced a positive crossmatch, and no anti-B that reacted with platelets could be demonstrated in group A plasmas. IgG anti-A reactions with group A platelets were eliminated in 100 percent of the group O plasmas tested after treatment with the synthetic solid-phase immunoadsorption technique. Synsorb-A may be a useful adjunct to platelet serologic testing when group O sera need to be tested against A platelets. Group A platelets bound less anti-A after exposure to chloroquine, but only 17 percent of platelets became negative when crossmatched with group O plasma. It was concluded that increased IgG binding occurs in a majority of platelet crossmatches using a k-ELISA technique when group O recipients are tested against group A donors. These results offer a potential explanation for conflicting results in studies of transfusion results with ABH-incompatible platelets. Transfusions of group B platelets to incompatible recipients may be more likely to yield satisfactory increments than incompatible transfusions of group A platelets, but this remains to be proven. There appear to be significant differences between red cells and platelets in regard to serologic reactivity in the ABH system.\r"

The same operator performed the paired procedures and collected all study data. The instruments provided equivalent high-yield platelet products (CS-3000: 5.3 x 10(11); Spectra: 5.7 x 10(11]. Platelet collection efficiency was greater with the Spectra (81%) than with the CS-3000 (57%) (p less than 0.0005). All products contained less than 1 mL of RBCs, but the Spectra products were more likely to contain less than 10(6) WBCs (14/31) than those of the CS-3000 (1/31) (p less than 0.001). In the remaining products, the mean WBC contamination was 1.0 x 10(8) for the CS-3000 and 0.03 x 10(8) for the Spectra (p less than 0.001). More ACD-A anticoagulant was infused with Spectra (463 mL) than with CS-3000 procedures (400 mL) (p = 0.002). Although postdonation ionized calcium (Ca2+) levels and the percentage of decrease in Ca2+ were not significantly different between groups, more Spectra donors experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia (20/31 vs 9/31; p = 0.015). CS-3000 products had lower mean volumes (217 mL) than Spectra collections (300 mL) (p less than 0.0005). Both instruments were accepted well by volunteer donors and the technical staff.\r"

After template bleeding time (TBT) was measured, 15 healthy volunteers underwent plateletpheresis and ingested 600 mg of aspirin. Autologous 111In-labeled platelets were transfused: unwashed (n = 5), washed with 0.9 percent saline solution (SS) (n = 5), and washed with a buffered 12.6 percent solution of ACD-A in 0.9 percent saline solution (n = 5). After transfusion, we measured TBT at 1, 4, and 24 hours; platelet survival at 10 minutes and 1, 4, and 24 hours and daily for 6 days; and the percentage of uptake in liver and spleen by quantitative whole-body radionuclide scintigraphy at 24 and 190 hours. We found that saline washing affected platelet recovery, 23.47 +/- 12 percent (p less than 0.001) as compared to 52.43 +/- 17 percent (p less than 0.002) for ACD-saline and 73.17 +/- 8 percent for control; that saline washing resulted in a greater liver uptake than control and ACD-saline-washed platelets (31.9 +/- 8% [p less than 0.001] vs 17.7 +/- 4.1 and 19.3 +/- 2.1% [p greater than 0.1], respectively); that, unlike control and ACD-saline-washed platelets, saline-washed platelets did not shorten bleeding time; and that neither type of washing affected survival. Although ACD-saline washing affects recovery, it also results in intact function, normal survival, higher recovery than SS platelets, and no significant liver uptake.\r"

  ".W": "Human platelet concentrates were stored in polyolefin bags at 22 to 24 degrees C on a horizontal shaker for up to 8 days. At different intervals, aliquots of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were removed aseptically and five variables, i.e., platelet counts, morphology, platelet-activating factor (PAF)-stimulated aggregation, phosphoinositide turnover, and [3H]PAF binding to platelet receptors, were studied. The number of platelets did not change during the 8 days of storage. Scanning electron microscopy of the platelets revealed a gradual morphologic change from biconcave flat discs to irregular, crenated forms. The PAF-induced aggregation of platelets declined with time of storage. A decrease to 50 percent of the Day 1 aggregatory response to PAF was evident on Day 2, and there was a further decline to about 20 percent by Day 6. Similarly, PAF receptor-coupled phosphoinositide turnover, as monitored by 32P incorporation into individual phosphoinositides, decreased dramatically with storage. After 2 to 3 days of storage, the phosphoinositide turnover was reduced to 50 percent of the original response, and it continued to decline to about 25 percent of original response by Day 5 or 6. The binding of [3H]PAF to washed human platelets indicated subtle changes between Days 2 and 4, which became more noticeable by Day 6. These results have raised the possibility of changes in the number of the receptors and/or their affinity for the ligand during storage. We conclude that although the number of platelets was maintained during storage for 8 days, a general deterioration of their responses to PAF occurred at the levels of cell surface receptor, transmembrane signaling (phosphoinositide turnover), and response (aggregation).\r"

The present study investigates whether these changes in the total population occur to the same extent in four size-dependent subpopulations with mean platelet volumes of 4.2, 5.7, 8.0, and 11.1 microns 3, obtained by counterflow centrifugation. Cryopreservation reduced the contents of the alpha granule markers and the generation of thromboxane B2 in the platelets from the four fractions to the same extent as in the platelets from the total suspension. Maximal aggregation of the platelets in response to collagen was measured by optical aggregation. The average decrease in light transmission after freezing was 47 +/- 3 percent (SEM) for the platelets in the total population, 40 +/- 3 percent for the largest platelets, and 65 +/- 5 percent for the smallest platelets, which indicates that aggregability was better preserved in the larger platelets than in the smaller cells. It is possible that, in the smallest platelets, a decrease in thromboxane generation of approximately 70 percent becomes rate-limiting for aggregation. Further improvements in the clinical use of freeze-preserved platelets may be sought in the preparation of concentrates with relatively high counts of large platelets.\r"

The POE is believed to have been the result of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). The diagnosis of GVHD was based upon the characteristic clinical picture and retrospective HLA typing. The implicated donor was homozygous for an HLA haplotype that appeared to be shared with the recipient: A24-CBL-Bw52-DR2-DRw52-DQw1, the most common haplotype in the Japanese population. This case raises the possibility that a transfusion of relatively fresh blood from a donor who has no HLA antigens incompatible with the recipient may result in GVHD in patients with no apparent immunoincompetence who are undergoing relatively minor surgery with no chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\r"

At the turn of the century, Wooten and Lydston reported a cure rate of roughly 50 per cent after ligation of the deep dorsal vein of the penis. In 1979, Ebbehoj and Wagner restored potency in three of four patients with venous leakage. Later, Virag reported the diagnostic technique of dynamic cavernosography and proposed deep venous ligation. In 1985, Wespes and Schulman reported an 80 per cent success rate for correction of venogenic impotence by ligating the deep dorsal vein and its tributaries. Since then, Bennett and associates have achieved success in six of eight patients, and Lewis and Puyau report a 50 to 75 per cent success. With the technique described above, after careful selection and proper diagnostic testing, impotence has resolved or erection improved in more than 80 per cent of our patients.\r"

  ".W": "Between June, 1977, and April, 1983, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) sponsored a phase III study comparing fast neutron radiotherapy as part of a mixed beam (neutron/photon) regimen with conventional photon (x-ray) radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced (Stages C and D1) adenocarcinoma of the prostate. A total of 91 analyzable patients were entered into the study with the two treatment groups balanced in regard to all major prognostic variables. The current analysis is for a median follow-up of 6.7 years (range 3.4-9.0 yrs.). The results are statistically significant in favor of the mixed-beam group of all parameters mentioned. At five years the freedom from local/regional relapse rate is 81 percent on the mixed-beam arm compared with 60 percent on the photon arm. The actuarial overall survival rate at five years is 70 percent on the mixed beam compared with 56 percent on the conventional photon arm. The determinantal survival at five years (which excluded death due to intercurrent disease in patients clinically free of cancer) was 82 percent on the mixed-beam arm compared with 61 percent on the photon arm. The type of therapy appeared to be the most important predictor of both local tumor control and patient survival in a step-wise Cox analysis. There was no difference in the treatment-related morbidity for the two patient groups. Mixed-beam therapy may be superior to standard photon radiotherapy for treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.\r"

A total of 115 patients underwent ligation of the deep dorsal vein of the penis. After a mean follow-up of 12.9 months, 67 patients (58.3%) were still able to obtain satisfactory erections. In 39 cases (33.9%), however, adjuvant corpus cavernosum autoinjection therapy was necessary. Eleven patients were submitted to spongiosolysis after ligation of the deep dorsal penile vein because of a distal venous leakage, consisting of venous shunts between the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum. After a mean follow-up of 14.2 months, 9 patients (81.8%) reported excellent penile rigidity; 5 of these patients, however, needed corpus cavernosum autoinjection therapy to maintain erectile function. One patient with ectopic veins emerging from the right crus of the penis was operated on successfully from a perineal approach. Serious complications did not occur in any of the patients. Despite the recurrence rate of 13 percent, venous surgery is an effective treatment for most patients concerned and offers a more physiologic erectile function than can be achieved by implantation of a penile prosthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The present study evaluates both penile xenon-133 washout (XWT) and papaverine tests (PT) in the diagnosis of vasculogenic impotence. XWT was accomplished by subcutaneous injection of xenon-133 (1-2 mCi in 0.1 mL saline solution) into the dorsal coronal prepuce. Abnormal XWT was suggested in patients whose clearance time (T1/2) was longer than 7.5 minutes and whose penile blood flow rate (Q) was less than 6 mL/100 g tissue/min. PT was done by intracavernous injection of papaverine (60 mg in 20 mL normal saline). Abnormal PT was indicated in patients whose onset of full erection was more than ten minutes after papaverine injection and whose duration of erection was less than one hour. Ten young and 11 older normal volunteers were examined with XWT only; all showed normal results. A total of 60 impotent patients were examined with both XWT and PT and were classified into four groups: in 2 patients (3.3%) both XWT and PT were normal (group I); in 8 (13.3%) XWT was abnormal and PT normal (group II); in 14 (23.3%) XWT was normal and PT abnormal (group III); and in 36 (60%) both XWT and PT were abnormal (group IV). On further examination with bilateral hypogastric arteriography in 10 XWT-abnormal patients and on surgical correction of abnormal curvature in 5 XWT-abnormal patients, all (100%) were proved to have penile arterial insufficiency. Erection cavernosography performed in 15 PT-abnormal patients confirmed penile venous insufficiency in 80 percent. We conclude both XWT and PT are simple and effective for evaluation of the penile arterial blood flow and venous competence, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Follow-up IVUs were performed on 6 of the 13 patients who had abnormal radiologic studies. The radionuclide renal scan was shown to be as accurate as the intravenous urogram in defining renal trauma. Patients who undergo liver-spleen scans for investigation of blunt abdominal trauma, and who may have renal trauma, may well undergo RNRS at the same time and obviate the need for an IVU, without any diagnostic compromise.\r"

Two patients died as a result of associated intracranial injuries, for a hospital survival of 90%. The operative repair was accomplished by graft replacement of the involved segment of the aorta in all but one patient who underwent a primary repair. Simple aortic crossclamping was used in 8 patients (40%) and heparinless femoral-femoral venoarterial bypass in 12 patients (60%). Neither renal failure nor paraplegia in any of the patients. Four patients required thoracic reoperations. These results indicate that an aggressive multidisciplinary surgical approach can produce favorable results in patients with traumatic descending aortic injuries.\r"

For most decisions, neither physicians nor nurses were significantly more accurate in their predictions than expected by chance alone. Moreover, nurses and physicians did not significantly agree with one another in their predictions of patients' preferences for any of these decisions. These results suggest that while nurses' and physicians' perceptions of patients' preferences for life-sustaining treatment are not necessarily similar, neither nurses nor physicians systematically understand their elderly patients' resuscitation preferences.\r"

To better characterize the injury problem in New Mexico, we calculated proportionate injury mortality and age-adjusted and age-specific injury mortality rates for the state's 3 major ethnic groups--American Indians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites. According to death certificate data collected from 1958 to 1982 and US population census figures, age-adjusted mortality rates for total external causes varied widely between the sexes and among the ethnic groups. Males in each ethnic group consistently had higher average annual age-adjusted external mortality rates than females. Injury mortality rates for American Indians of both sexes were 2 to 3 times higher than those for the other New Mexico ethnic groups. Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death from injury for all 3 groups. Homicide accounted for twice the proportion of injury death in Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic white males (12.5% and 6.1%, respectively), while the proportion of males dying of suicide was highest in non-Hispanic whites. Deaths from excessive cold and exposure were leading causes of injury mortality for American Indians, but these causes were not among the leading causes of injury mortality for Hispanics or non-Hispanic whites. We conclude that the minority populations in New Mexico are at high risk for injury-related death and that the major causes of injury mortality vary substantially in the state's predominant ethnic populations.\r"

The position physicians advocated was unrelated to their specialty, experience diagnosing or treating substance abuse problems, their attitudes toward the efficacy of the treatment of drug abuse, or any other work role or habit we measured. Legalization or citation as compared with harsher penalties, however, was more likely favored by physicians who were younger, less religious, politically more liberal, and those less likely to perceive a serious drug problem in society. Legalization was also more likely favored by physicians who themselves had used marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines but was unrelated to the use of alcohol, cigarettes, or tranquilizers. Although physician opinion should be sought as society deals with the drug problem, this study suggests how physicians' characteristics may influence the opinions that are rendered.\r"

The premise of our study was that VBAC is a safe option in a community hospital setting. Any patient meeting the criteria of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) was eligible for a trial of labor, and ACOG guidelines regarding mandatory facilities and personnel were followed. One hundred six women with a history of previous Cesarean section were delivered of infants during the study period. Of these, 16 attempted a trial of labor, and 13 (81.3 percent) had vaginal births with minimum morbidity. There were no instances of scar disruption. Thirty-nine percent of the patients who were successful with VBAC had had a previous vaginal birth. By offering VBAC, the participating physicians were able to reduce their repeat Cesarean section rate by 12 percent.\r"

The term \"polyp\" refers to any circumscribed mass of tissue that arises from mucosa and protrudes into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The significance of this lesion in the rectum and colon is its propensity for malignant change. Although small polyps in the region of the rectum tend to be hyperplastic and those more proximal tend to be adenomas with a significant malignant potential, there is no way to distinguish them visually; hence, all need to be biopsied. The following case report shows the necessity of identifying neoplastic lesions within diminutive polyps (less than 1 cm). Standard biopsy technique usually removes these lesions; nevertheless, when histology confirms the presence of adenoma or carcinoma, the patient requires additional evaluation of the entire large intestine and more frequent follow-up examinations.\r"

We report a case of axillary and subclavian vein \"effort\" thrombosis in a young woman athlete, who was predisposed to thrombosis by all three postulates of the Virchow triad: namely, (1) stasis caused by constriction from a cervical rib, (2) increased coagulability as a result of oral contraceptive use, and (3) vessel wall injury because of competitive softball participation. Of the available therapeutic plans, we believe that athletes with \"effort\" thrombosis should have aggressive treatment that is initiated as early as possible to prevent swelling, tingling numbness, easy fatigue of the arm, and pain on prolonged use of the affected extremity.\r"

The abnormality was diagnosed radiologically in nine patients in whom follow-up varied from 1 to 6 years. Four patients had bilateral lesions, making a total of 13 examples. The CT findings were analyzed and compared with previously published criteria for the diagnosis of this disorder. In all cases, CT showed a rounded mass, 3.5-7.0 cm in diameter, abutting a thickened pleural surface in the lung periphery. The margin closest to the hilum was blurred by the entering vessels in 92% of the cases. Our experience suggests that the CT findings of rounded atelectasis are characteristic of the abnormality.\r"

In phase 1, the dyes were injected into 10 mastectomy specimens and allowed to diffuse for 24-48 hr. In phase 2, the breasts of four premastectomy patients were injected with the dyes and the dyes were allowed to diffuse for 3 3/4, 12, 24, and 47 hr before mastectomy. In phase 3, the breasts of 18 women in whom 20 breast localizations were performed before excisional biopsy were injected with methylene blue or toluidine blue up to 2 hr 10 min before the biopsy. All excised stained breast tissue was evaluated blindly. The amount of pain associated with injections of the dye was recorded. The 22 women in phases 2 and 3 had had mammograms before, and the parenchymal patterns had been classified according to Wolfe. In the patients injected 3 3/4, 12, 24, and 47 hr before mastectomy, more intense staining with less diffusibility was seen with toluidine blue than with methylene blue. In the 20 localization procedures before excisional biopsy, no difference in intensity of staining or radius of diffusion was seen between methylene blue and toluidine blue with maximal diffusion times of 2 hr 10 min. Breast parenchymal pattern did not correlate with stain intensity or diffusibility. The six patients in whom both methylene blue and toluidine blue were injected and the 18 patients in whom either dye was injected felt less discomfort at the time of injection of toluidine blue than of methylene blue. Our results suggest that toluidine blue causes less discomfort and produces a more intense stain with a smaller diffusion radius than methylene blue regardless of breast parenchymal pattern.\r"

Areas of ILC frequently are of low density, not much greater than that of the surrounding parenchyma. The mammographic appearance may reflect the behavior of ILC tumor cells, which travel in linear array (\"single file\") along and around the arborizing ducts that serve as scaffolding for these small, malignant cells that permeate the parenchyma without a central nidus. This feature of ILC may also help explain why tumors may be palpable as areas of vague induration or thickening rather than as discrete masses. When tumors are hidden in dense breast tissue (pattern 3) and not well imaged by mammography or when there are subtle mammographic changes (pattern 1), sonography may help confirm the presence of a solid mass. Most of the suspected tumors imaged by sonography were palpable as discrete masses or areas of induration.\r"

Univariate and then multivariate logistic regression were applied to these quantitative parameters to determine which of these best discriminated nonadenomas from adenomas, and whether or not more than one of these parameters improved the prediction. The adrenal mass/liver signal-intensity ratio on T2-weighted spin-echo images could not be used to differentiate nonadenomas from adenomas. Adrenal mass/fat signal-intensity ratios on T2-weighted spin-echo images, adrenal/liver T2 relaxation-time ratios, and adrenal mass T2 relaxation times were best for distinguishing nonadenomas from adenomas. By using a T2 value of greater than 61 msec, the true-positive ratio/false-positive ratio of differentiating nonadenomas from adenomas was 100%/20%; at greater than 82 msec, it was 64%/0.06%. The adrenal mass/fat signal-intensity ratios on T2-weighted spin-echo images and the adrenal/liver T2 relaxation-time ratios showed similar inherent discriminatory capacity. Overlap remains despite the use of these parameters. On the basis of this preliminary information, we conclude that MR has merit for the characterization of adrenal masses at 1.5 T. T2 relaxation time of the adrenal mass shows the greatest promise for discriminating nonadenomas from adenomas.\r"

In all seven patients, MR images showed a large endometrial mass deeply invading the myometrium or beyond. In addition, MR images showed intraperitoneal (two patients) and ovarian (one patient) metastases. Although the massiveness of the tumors on initial presentation may suggest the diagnosis of mixed mullerian sarcoma, the MR imaging findings are nonspecific and mimic invasive endometrial carcinoma.\r"

Nine patients had untreated primary tumors (thigh, four; forearm, two; and buttock, rectus abdominis muscle, and infratemporal fossa, one each) and two had locally recurrent masses (one each in the retroperitoneum and retrocrural space). All patients were evaluated by conventional radiography, two by sonography, eight by CT, five by angiography, and three by MR. Conventional radiographs showed the soft-tissue mass in only four patients; four lesions caused destruction of adjacent bone and two had soft-tissue calcification. Unenhanced CT showed low-attenuation lesions in four of five patients. The lesions were hypervascular on contrast-enhanced CT or angiography in each of nine patients studied. Prominent draining veins were shown by CT or angiography in five patients. Three lesions had a prolonged capillary stain on angiography. Alveolar soft-part sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a hypervascular soft-tissue mass, particularly in the thigh of a young adult.\r"

Two components in the sella turcica were identified in all 30 children without pituitary gland disease, and the posterior lobe was identified as a high-intensity structure on T1-weighted images. In all 13 patients with diabetes insipidus, the normal hyperintense signal of the posterior hypophysis was absent on T1-weighted images. Three patients with suprasellar tumors presented with a progressively enlarging pituitary stalk on follow-up. Our findings show that absence of the normal hyperintense signal of the posterior lobe is closely related to a loss of function of the neurohypophysis. Size or signal modification of the pituitary stalk should suggest the development of a suprasellar tumor.\r"

Using the signal intensity of CSF as an internal control, we calculated the percentage increase in signal intensity from pre- to postgadolinium studies. Tumors (astrocytoma, ependymoma, schwannoma) enhanced 70-350%; epidural scar, normal epidural venous plexus, and dorsal root ganglion enhanced up to 200%. Contrast enhancement does not per se distinguish neoplastic from normal tissue. Enhancement with gadolinium-DTPA appeared to increase the conspicuousness of intramedullary tumors but not intraosseous metastases. We believe that gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is a valuable adjunct to routine MR imaging in the evaluation of intraspinal neoplastic processes and may be useful in delineating normal and postoperative structures in the spinal canal.\r"

Four patient groups were studied with varying gradient-echo TEs (6 or 13 msec) and flip angles (10 degrees or 60 degrees). Images were evaluated independently for contrast behavior and anatomy, then directly compared for conspicuity of lesions. The FLASH sequences (especially with a 10 degrees flip angle) produced better conspicuity of disease in half the imaging time. T1-weighted spin-echo sequences were more sensitive to marrow changes and intradural disease. The short TE sequence (6 msec) did not produce any diagnostic advantage over the longer TE sequence (13 msec). A fast and sensitive MR examination for cervical extradural disease combines a sagittal T1-weighted spin-echo acquisition with sagittal and axial FLASH 10 degrees sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective evaluation was made of four patients with tuberculous spondylitis who had been studied by MR with T1- and T2-weighted images in the sagittal plane and spin-density-weighted images in the axial plane. Evaluation was made of the distribution of abnormal signals within the body and posterior elements of the vertebrae, the intervertebral disk, and the associated paraspinal and epidural areas. In two of the cases, three-level involvement was seen with noninvolvement of intervening disks; metastases were misdiagnosed. One patient had anterior/inferior erosion of the vertebral body without visualization of the disk. The last patient had the more typical MR characteristics of intervertebral disk infection. Plain film examination showed only degenerative changes in three of the four cases. MR revealed more extensive involvement than the plain films did. Involvement of the posterior element and posterior vertebral body was prominent in three of the four cases. This is a significant finding since these patients are more likely to have neurologic symptoms and require laminectomy. Follow-up examinations in two cases showed increased signal on T1-weighted images, suggesting infiltration of hemopoietic marrow with fat, as has been described for degenerative osteoarthritis. The anatomy of the microcirculation of the vertebral body is related to the patterns of vertebral osteomyelitis, and discrepancies can be seen between the findings in our cases and the MR criteria previously noted for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. The MR findings in our patients generally were more typical of neoplasm than of infection. These findings may reflect the characteristics of the tuberculous organism relative to the age-dependent pattern of vertebral microcirculation. Correct diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis in young to middle-aged adults requires correlation of MR and clinical findings.\r"

The results indicate that the physical characteristics of the digital system are acceptable for lower-extremity venography. Digital fluoroscopic hard copy was compared with conventional spot films in 22 examinations. The digital examinations were as accurate as the conventional examinations. Procedure time, exposure to radiation, film costs, and repeated injections of contrast medium because of errors in exposure were reduced with the digital method. The need for extra technologists was eliminated. The advantages of digital radiographic displays, postprocessing, storage, and transmission were maximized.

  ".U": "89320236\r", 
  ".W": "In MR imaging, the sampling bandwidth is the rate at which the signal is digitized by the analog-to-digital converter. Reducing the sampling bandwidth can decrease noise in long TE images at the expense of increases in the artifacts of chemical-shift misregistration and motion. We compared 39 pairs of axial images with bandwidths of 32 kHz and 8-10 kHz. In 23 of these comparison studies (six female pelvis, seven male pelvis, 10 abdomen), all other variables were held constant, and in 16 comparisons (10 female pelvis, six male pelvis), signal from fat was suppressed in images with reduced bandwidth. Six patients with 11 liver lesions were included in those undergoing abdominal imaging. In three patients, fat was suppressed in images of the abdomen. The contrast-to-noise ratio was greater with reduced bandwidth for urine vs fat (24.5 vs 17.2; p less than .05) and central vs peripheral parts of the prostate gland (34.1 vs 22.7; p less than .02). In the abdomen, the contrast-to-noise ratio was increased between liver and right kidney (36.6 vs 25.2; p less than .01) and between liver and lesion (30.2 vs 18.2; p less than .005), but the motion-induced artifact was worse. An increase in chemical-shift misregistration did not affect the appearance of the internal structure of the uterus, prostate gland, or liver, but it made examination of the ovaries, seminal vesicles, and extrahepatic tissues difficult. The chemical-shift artifact in pelvic images could be eliminated by suppressing signal from fat with frequency-selective saturation pulses, but results were less satisfactory in the abdomen. When reduced bandwidth and fat suppression were combined, the contrast-to-noise ratio was improved for endometrium vs myometrium (22.9 vs 15.2; p less than .05) and central vs peripheral parts of the prostate gland (62.7 vs 28.5; p less than .02). Reduction of the sampling bandwidth is a promising technique for imaging the pelvis with small field of view and long TR/TE, but it currently appears less promising for images in the upper abdomen at 1.5 T. The increased chemical-shift artifact caused by reduced bandwidth can be eliminated by suppressing signal from fat.\r"

The in-hospital mortality was 11.1% (37 patients). Follow-up is complete for 293 of 299 (98%) hospital survivors at a median of 24 months. Of patients discharged, the mean age was 55 +/- 11 years, 49% received intravenous thrombolytic therapy, 53% had multivessel coronary artery disease, and the mean ejection fraction was 48 +/- 10%.

Post-discharge survival was independently predicted by no prior myocardial infarction (96.9% versus 87.3% 2-year survival, p less than 0.001 by log rank analysis) and infarct artery patency at hospital discharge (which had its major impact on survival early after hospital discharge: [97.4% versus 93.4% 1-year survival but 94.2% versus 93.4% 2-year survival; overall p = 0.02]). For patients with analyzable ventriculograms at hospital discharge, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% was also a significant independent predictor of survival (98.1% versus 85.8% 2-year survival, p = 0.01).

Ascending aortic compliance was measured angiographically in 22 patients with documented coronary artery disease and in 11 patients with syndrome X. Magnetic resonance velocity mapping was used in six patients with documented coronary artery disease and in three patients with syndrome X to study two-dimensional velocity profiles in the proximal and mid-ascending aorta and to quantify both forward and reverse flow. The measurements were compared with earlier published measurements from 24 normal subjects. It was found that patients with ischemic heart disease or syndrome X had decreased or no measurable aortic compliance and that they had significantly reduced or abnormal ascending aortic reverse flow likely to cause reduced coronary artery flow. A new theory is advanced that decreased myocardial perfusion leading to ischemic heart disease has two sources: (1) insufficient blood flow into the coronary artery inlet due to abnormal aortic function and independent of coronary artery stenosis and (2) local coronary artery stenosis. Observations supporting the theory are presented.\r"

We have therefore investigated this subject in five domestic pigs after experimental myocardial infarction. Manual conversion was attempted in 20 induced VTs. Six VTs were converted by CT, seven VTs were converted by the first SCTs, and six VTs were converted by the last of multiple (two to seven) SCTs. The overall success was 95%. There were no serious complications. The rate of successful SCTs exceeded the rate of VT by 10% to 126%. The technique of SCTs, the mechanisms of manual conversion, and the controversial opinions regarding the value of precordial thumping in asystole, VT, and ventricular fibrillation are discussed. SCTs should be practiced only very cautiously in patients until further experience is available.\r"

Eight patients had ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the first 48 hours after myocardial infarction. The signal-averaged ECG was abnormal in only one of these patients. Twelve patients had late arrhythmic events during the first year of follow-up (four sudden deaths and eight instances of documented ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). Nine of the 12 patients had an abnormal signal-averaged ECG in phase 2 and four of these nine had a normal recording in phase 1. Five patients had a transient abnormal signal-averaged ECG in phase 1, whereas six patients had an abnormal recording only in phase 3. None of these 11 patients had an arrhythmic event. Stepwise logistic regression showed that an abnormal signal-averaged ECG in phase 2 has the most significant relation to late arrhythmic events.

To determine whether the protection afforded by beta blockade is species- and model-specific, we studied 23 chloralose-anesthetized cats. Eight animals were studied over a short term and underwent serial determinations of the ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold prior to and 1 minute after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and immediately following reperfusion of a 10-minute occlusion. Beta-blocking doses of intravenous propranolol (P) (0.5 mg/kg) attenuated the fall in VF threshold during acute ischemia. Increasing the dose of P to 1 mg/kg did not provide further protection, nor did P protect against reperfusion VF. The other 15 animals underwent a preliminary surgical procedure during which the LAD was completely and irreversibly occluded (nine animals) or in which a sham procedure was performed (six animals). Two weeks later, we measured ventricular refractoriness at several left ventricular sites, ventricular inducibility using programmed electrical stimulation, and VF thresholds both before and after administration of intravenous P (1 mg/kg). Ventricular refractory periods in the infarcted zones were significantly increased compared with normal sites and with values obtained in sham-operated animals. In addition, VF thresholds in the infarcted animals were lower than those obtained in the sham-operated group. Before treatment, a reproducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was induced by means of programmed stimulation in seven of the nine chronically infarcted animals but in none of the sham-operated animals (p less the 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Long-term BB therapy was given to 24 of 30 patients, whereas six other patients with hemodynamically unstable VT during BB therapy received other long-term treatment. During a mean follow-up of 824 days, 6 of 24 patients had recurrent VT. BB therapy was discontinued in two patients because of side effects. Long-term success was predicted by left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 45%, absence of coronary disease, and age less than 60 years (all p less than 0.02). Neither suppression of arrhythmia during exercise testing, nor results of programmed stimulation or ECG monitoring were predictive of outcome. Thus beta-adrenergic blockers can be effective as solitary antiarrhythmic therapy in selected patients with VT.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two young adult (mean age 27.8 +/- 5.3 years) survivors of sudden cardiac arrest underwent invasive cardiac assessment. Initial evaluation by cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and hemodynamic studies identified two groups of young survivors. The first consisted of 13 (60%) subjects who had definable structural cardiac or lung disease accountable for a cardiac arrest event. Dilated cardiomyopathy dominated this group. Mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, anomalous origin of the right coronary artery, and tetralogy of Fallot were also encountered. The second group included nine subjects (40%) with normal cardiac structure and normal hemodynamic parameters. Electrophysiologic testing demonstrated in three of these patients the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The electrophysiologic studies had a higher yield in reproduction of life-threatening arrhythmias among the subjects in the second group as opposed to the first group. The observation that 10 subjects (45%) from both groups had preceding symptoms varying from palpitations and chest pain to syncope and recurrent cardiac arrest events, is in contradiction to previous findings in the literature and raises a question of appropriate evaluation of young adults with cardiac symptoms.\r"

To determine if improved defibrillation could be achieved with a different waveform morphology, we implanted 4.5 cm2 titanium patches to the left and right ventricle of 28 dogs. After ventricular fibrillation was induced, defibrillation was attempted using 7, 12, 13, or 17 joules. A 5 msec rectangular uniphasic waveform morphology was compared with a 10 msec rectangular biphasic waveform with the lagging 5 msec pulse of half the amplitude of the leading 5 msec. In an additional seven dogs, a transvenous bipolar catheter was placed with the distal electrode in the right ventricular apex and the proximal electrode in the superior vena cava. Biphasic and uniphasic shocks were compared at 14 joules. In the patch-patch system, the biphasic waveform was superior to the uniphasic waveform at 7 joules (67% versus 35%, p less than 0.001) and at 12 joules (93% versus 78%, p less than 0.001). No statistically significant differences were achieved at 13 joules or 17 joules. In the catheter electrode system with a delivered energy of 14 joules, the biphasic waveform was more effective than the uniphasic waveform (87% versus 27%, p less than 0.001). Manufacturers of automatic implantable defibrillators should consider this information in the design of future automatic implantable defibrillators.\r"

  ".W": "Although pressure gradients across valvar obstructions can be estimated by incorporating peak flow velocity distal to obstruction into a modified Bernoulli equation, such attempts in aortic coarctations have not been uniformly successful. The purpose of this study was to examine the value of several Doppler flow parameters in predicting pressure gradient across the aortic coarctation. Twenty-eight patients, aged 14 days to 13 years, in whom Doppler variables and catheterization pressure gradients were measured within 24 hours of each other, were included in the study. There were 60 pairs of such data. Correlation coefficients between catheter pressure gradient on the one hand and Doppler peak flow velocity and Doppler pressure gradient (DPG) estimates using (1) distal velocity and (2) both distal and proximal velocities (DPV) in the Bernoulli equation on the other were 0.74 to 0.76. Subgrouping the subjects into native coarctations, coarctations immediately after and 6 to 30 months after balloon angioplasty did not improve the correlation coefficient. Duration-related measures of Doppler flow curve distal to the coarctation, namely, acceleration time and antegrade flow time (AFT), corrected (to heart rate) and uncorrected, improved the correlation coefficient to 0.82 (p less than 0.001). A combination of magnitude- and duration-related parameters appears to give the best fit, and the catheter gradient can be estimated by 0.31 DPG using DPV + 0.22 AFT fraction + 0.04 AFT - 16.67 (r = 0.92). Also, the mean Doppler flow velocity decreased (p less than 0.001) from 3.62 +/- 0.45 to 2.65 +/- 0.53 m/sec following balloon angioplasty of aortic coarctation; this improvement persisted (2.66 +/- 0.54 m/sec) on follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These indices were calculated from the product of pulsed Doppler mitral velocities and either the excursion of the anterior mitral leaflet or the separation of both mitral leaflets as measures of the changing mitral orifice area. The derived flow indices and the mitral velocities alone were compared to left ventricular filling as determined by radionuclide ventriculography in 24 patients. When compared as areas under the matched decile divisions of the derived filling sequences by linear regression analysis, the relationship for combined Doppler and M-mode versus radionuclide left ventricular filling was closer to the line of identity (slope = 0.98 and 0.94 using the anterior mitral leaflet and both mitral leaflets, respectively, both p = NS versus the line of identity) than was the relationship for mitral velocities alone versus radionuclide left ventricular filling (slope = 0.74, p less than 0.05 versus the line of identity). The instantaneous mitral volume flow indices more closely resemble the time course and shape of radionuclide left ventricular filling curves than do mitral velocities alone, and the application of these indices should assist the quantitative description by Doppler echocardiography of left ventricular filling.\r"

We analyzed 163 consecutive patients who had a positive low-dose (0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes) dipyridamole-echocardiography test, requiring intravenous aminophylline as an antidote. All patients also performed an exercise stress test. In 141 of these patients, the signs of ischemia were reversed by administration of intravenous aminophylline (group I), while the remaining 22 patients were resistant to aminophylline (240 mg/kg over 3 minutes) and received additional treatment with nitrates to relieve ischemia (group II). The increase in rate-pressure product (RPP = mm Hg x beats/min x 100) measured during the exercise stress test in the patients in group I was significantly greater than that determined during dipyridamole-induced ischemia (204 +/- 41 versus 145 +/- 33, p less than 0.01). However, the increases in RPP under both conditions were similar for the patients in group II (147 +/- 24 versus 150 +/- 20, p = ns). In patients with dipyridamole-induced ischemia who were resistant to aminophylline, the rise in myocardial oxygen consumption--probably linked to reflex sympathetic activation--might maintain ischemia independently from flow maldistribution, which should be reversed by aminophylline.\r"

Right and left ventricular ejection fraction was measured serially at 2-minute intervals during exercise. The anaerobic threshold occurred at 74% and 80% of maximum heart rate, respectively, during upright and supine exercise. Left and right ventricular ejection fractions rose from rest to the anaerobic threshold (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively) and there was a further increase between the anaerobic threshold and maximum exercise (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate of rise of ejection fraction beyond the anaerobic threshold was slightly blunted compared with the rise prior to attaining the anaerobic threshold. There was no significant difference in ventricular performance between supine and upright exercise. The data demonstrate that ventricular performance increases steadily during exercise and is not limited by the conversion of aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.\r"

Hemodynamics and radionuclide angiograms were obtained under control conditions and during six additional steady-state loading conditions. Isochronal Emax averaged 7.14 +/- 2.54 mm Hg/ml, while Ees averaged 5.68 +/- 1.88 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.01), but they were highly correlated (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). This observation was related to the assumption of linearity when curvilinearity was present and to the important influence of timing on these relationships. The Emax and Ees slope values were compared to dog weight; left ventricular weight, which ranged from 85 to 142 gm (mean 113 +/- 18 gm); and left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which ranged from 15 to 56 ml (mean 29 +/- 10 ml) using multiple regression analyses. The Emax and Ees slope values demonstrated a comparable inverse linear relationship with only left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = 0.76 and -0.69, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01). We conclude that the differences between Emax and Ees slope values calculated with radionuclide angiography are related to the assumption of linearity when curvilinearity is present and to the importance of the timing of systolic events and that both Emax and Ees are comparably related to left ventricular end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cell orientations were measured in five regions from each section using a polarizing microscope with a rotating stage. Histograms of cell orientation angles were plotted and the mean and angular deviation of each sample were calculated. In normal hearts, cells were predominantly aligned parallel to each other. Orientation distributions were sharply peaked, with angular deviations ranging from 4 to 13 degrees. For HC, the sharp peak was lacking and angular deviations varied from 7 to 37 degrees; some distributions were bimodal. Areas in HC septa that appeared normal by gross inspection had abnormal orientation distributions. Polarized light microscopy provides an improved method of detecting and quantifying cellular disorganization in HC.\r"

Pulmonary arterial anatomy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography in 20 patients, ages 3 months to 20 years, with cyanotic heart disease associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Excellent correlation between MRI and angiographic estimates of pulmonary artery diameter was obtained (main pulmonary artery, r = 0.96; right pulmonary artery, r = 0.93; left pulmonary artery, r = 0.96). A similar excellent correlation (kappa = 0.83) was found in the assessment of the presence and severity of proximal pulmonary arterial stenoses. However, stenoses in the peripheral pulmonary arteries visualized with angiography were missed with MRI. MRI and angiography showed complete agreement in determining the patency of 11 surgical shunts. MRI did not demonstrate all of the systemic collateral vessels present with angiography, and the distal connections of collaterals were not detected with MRI. MRI is comparable to angiography in the evaluation of central pulmonary arterial anatomy over a wide range of ages. These findings suggest an important role for noninvasive MRI in the serial evaluation of pulmonary artery morphology in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease before and after surgical repair.\r"

The performance of this catheter is compared to a non-fiber optic collection system with an equivalent delivery/collection geometry. For a given sample, fluorescence lineshapes obtained using the two systems are identical; differences in peak fluorescence intensity are related to the different collection efficiencies of the two systems. It is shown that the fluorescence lineshape of arterial tissue depends on the delivery/collection geometry of the detection system, and that this is due to the interaction of absorption and fluorescence within the artery wall. This effect is investigated systematically using a specially designed collection system. Results are analyzed qualitatively using a simple, one-dimensional model of tissue fluorescence. With this analysis, we present design requirements for a collection system in which such geometric effects are eliminated, and show that our optical fiber laser catheter satisfies these requirements.\r"

The inability to see through blood remains the most significant limitation to the general application of angioscopy. Local irrigation with a balanced salt solution is the most commonly used method to clear the blood from a restricted field in a particular vessel. We have developed a new catheter irrigation pump system (maximum flow rate 340 ml/min) to establish and maintain visibility of the field during intraoperative angioscopy. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the safety of irrigating with high volume flows in the peripheral arteries and defined the basic principles of irrigation for angioscopy. The prototype pump tested in this study provides a wide range of flow rates and permits precise measurements of the fluid delivered. The instrument's display and its control with a single foot pedal makes its use relatively simple, obviating the need for additional support personnel while increasing the efficacy and safety of the angioscopic examination and increasing the number of situations where angioscopy may be very useful.\r"

Immediate angioplasty produces a higher recanalization rate, yet reclosure is more likely with this procedure. In many cases, patient selection for acute angioplasty remains controversial. Randomized trials comparing the results of thrombolysis with those of angioplasty are needed before definitive decisions can be made.\r"

  ".W": "The high factor VII coagulant (VIIc) activity in men at high risk of coronary heart disease suggests that restoring normal hemostatic activity with appropriate oral anticoagulants might constitute effective primary prevention. A pilot study was therefore undertaken of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of long-term, low-dose warfarin therapy. Middle-aged men at high risk (mean VIIc 120% of standard) but without clinical coronary heart disease or contraindications to anticoagulants were randomized to warfarin or placebo. The initial warfarin dose (2.5 mg/day) was increased at intervals to lower VIIc to 70% of standard and increase the prothrombin time international normalized ratio to 1.6. The control participants received the same dose sequence of placebo. The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of the design, the absence of any increased risk of serious bleeding, and the high compliance and low withdrawal rate from randomized treatment. Accordingly, a full-scale thrombosis prevention trial has been launched, which, in addition to low-dose warfarin, includes a low-dose aspirin regimen (75 mg/day) in a factorial design. The aim of this trial is to produce a 30% reduction in coronary heart disease in 6,000 high-risk men aged 45 to 69 years. The men will receive either separate or combined therapy and will be followed up for 5 years. Evidence so far indicates that the risk of bleeding in those receiving combined therapy will be no higher than that in those taking aspirin alone.\r"

A double-blind trial was undertaken in patients with anterior transmural myocardial infarction to evaluate the ability of a high-dose heparin regimen to prevent left ventricular mural thrombosis. The high dose consisted of 12,500 U of calcium heparin subcutaneously every 12 hours for 10 days, which was compared with a low dose consisting of 5,000 U every 12 hours. The formation of left ventricular mural thrombosis was assessed by means of 2-dimensional echocardiography on day 10 after infarction. The high-dose group had a significantly lower incidence of left ventricular mural thrombosis than did the low-dose group. This was achieved without increasing the incidence of bleeding. The benefits of high-dose heparin were associated with maintaining plasma heparin concentrations at 0.2 U/ml and activated partial thromboplastin time between 50 and 60 seconds.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the effects of supplementation and diarrhea are synergistic in that supplementation modifies the negative effect of diarrhea on linear growth, length and diarrheal morbidity were compared at 36 mo of age for two cohorts of Colombian children: supplemented from birth and unsupplemented. Among unsupplemented children diarrhea was negatively associated with length. Among supplemented children diarrhea had no effect on length and differed from that of unsupplemented children. Thus, supplementation completely offset the negative effect of diarrheal disease on length. Targeting supplementation programs to the critical period of high diarrheal prevalence among infants and young children should increase the effectiveness of such programs in preventing growth retardation associated with diarrhea.\r"

The normal range derived from the lognormal distribution was 0.29-2.64 nmol/L (geometric means = 0.87 nmol/L, median = 0.86 nmol/L). Young females had significantly decreased plasma phylloquinone concentrations when compared with the elderly females whereas concentrations in young males were slightly higher than those in elderly males. A regression model was constructed and revealed that plasma phylloquinone concentrations were positively correlated with plasma triglycerides and alpha-tocopherol. Although the elderly subjects (means = 1.05 nmol/L) had higher levels of phylloquinone than the young subjects (0.94 nmol/L), when the concentration of phylloquinone in plasma is expressed as nanomoles phylloquinone per millimole of triglyceride, the elderly subjects (0.62 x 10(-6) showed decreased levels for phylloquinone compared with the young subjects (0.82 x 10(-6) (p less than 0.001).\r"

Recently we developed a method for the microdetermination of 4-py by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urinary excretion of 4-py in Japanese students from Teikoku Women's University who consumed self-selected foods was 7.12 +/- 3.25 mumol/d, which is about one-fourth of N'-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and about one-ninth of N'-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-py) excretion. The correlation coefficient between daily niacin equivalent (NE) intake and daily 4-py excretion was 0.529, which was about the same as the correlation coefficient between daily NE intake and daily 2-py excretion and which was two times higher than the correlation coefficient between daily NE intake and daily MNA excretion.\r"

Systematic studies of compatibility, solubility, and bioavailability led to this study of a microcrystalline complex ferric orthophosphate (CFOP), Fe3H8(NH4)-(PO4)6.6H2O, a well-defined compound. This compound was labeled with 59Fe, and the native Fe in meals was labeled with 55FeCl3. The ratio of absorbed 59Fe to absorbed 55Fe is a direct measure of the fraction of CFOP that joins the nonheme Fe pool and that is made potentially available for absorption. The relative bioavailability of CFOP varied from 30% to 60% when labeled wheat rolls were served with different meals. The CFOP meets practical requirements of an Fe fortificant for flour well, with regard to both compatibility and bioavailability in humans.\r"

RBC copper concentrations were significantly lower in MS patients than in control subjects (mean +/- SEM: 0.048 +/- 0.005 vs 0.060 +/- 0.002 mumol/g Hb) because of decreased RBC Cu with steroid therapy. RBC Zn-Cu ratios were significantly higher (14.9 +/- 1.0 vs 10.1 +/- 0.3) in MS patients than in control subjects, differing in both groups of MS patients. In MS and control subjects, RBC Cu correlated significantly with RBC Zn (r = 0.56, 0.49). Disease acuity and disability had no effect on trace-mineral status. These data suggest that in MS there is altered Cu and Zn homeostasis that may cause or result from the disease and is influenced by corticosteroid therapy.

Total fecal bile acid and neutral animal sterol concentrations were lower in South Asians than in a native British comparison group. Sixty-two percent of South Asians excreted detectable quantities of free primary bile acids, which were not present in stools from native British subjects. The ratio of fecal coprostanol to total neutral animal sterols was also lower in South Asians. Low risk of colon cancer in this population may be related to reduced microbial activity in the bowel and low levels of tumor-promoting secondary bile acids.\r"

The most striking finding is that 7 d of diet record do not rank subjects with the degree of accuracy commonly assumed. For some nutrients, such as iron, zinc, nicotinic acid, and pyridoxine, it may be desirable to record diet over a number of short, separate periods to achieve the number of days required. For others, such as copper, retinol, carotene, vitamin B-12, polyunsaturated fatty acids, P:S, and alcohol, alternative methods of assessment based on dietary histories or questionnaires may be more appropriate.\r"

By this method, the mean corrected Br space in 82 healthy adults representing a wide range of body weights was 0.218 +/- .034 L/kg (mean +/- 1 SD) with a range of 0.153-0.295 L/kg, which is consistent with reported values. There was a significant, inverse relationship between corrected Br space per kilogram and obesity as measured by body mass index. The corrected Br space in six children aged 3-36 mo was 0.335-0.394 L/kg, which is also consistent with reported values in children of this age. This method for Br measurement can easily and readily be applied for the determination of extracellular water volume.\r"

In contrast, the LCD group lost 2.8 kg during the initial 6 wk but failed to achieve weight loss during the second 6 wk. Consequently, the SNW group lost nearly twice as much weight over the 12-wk period as did LCD participants. A beneficial effect of SNW on serum cholesterol and triglycerides was noted; both measures declined in conjunction with the weight loss. Such alterations were greater in the SNW group than in LCD participants. Both schemes proved safe.

The reported vitamin B-6 intakes were 1.18 +/- 0.44 mg/d (means +/- SD). Plasma PLP levels in the obese and nonobese black women were similar; these levels were also similar to those observed previously for white obese and nonobese women having similar physical characteristics. All subjects had plasma PLP levels indicative of adequate status with one possible exception. Obesity did not affect the plasma PLP levels in these black women.\r"

The average total weight loss was 5.0 kg. During the second and third week on the diet the rate of weight loss was 211 +/- 77 g/d (mean +/- SD) and individual values were well predicted by admission resting metabolic rate (RMR) (r = 0.66, p less than 0.0001). The calculated energy density of the weight lost in this phase was 7000 kcal/kg (29.3 MJ/kg). However, the weight loss in the first week had a labile component of 815 +/- 1202 g, which was not well predicted by RMR (r = 0.20, p less than 0.05). The effect of this labile component was to obscure the overall rate of weight loss so some of the patients did not show net weight loss until day 13 of the diet, although they were in negative energy balance.\r"

Eight healthy women were administered capsulated Trp (3 g) or placebo (3 g lactose) during two follicular and two luteal phases of their menstrual cycles. Trp loading resulted in increased plasma concentrations of Trp and kynurenine, in an increase in the ratio of Trp to neutral amino acids in plasma, and in an increase in urinary excretion of Trp and kynurenine at both phases of the menstrual cycle. However at 3 h after Trp ingestion, plasma kynurenine levels in the luteal phase (23.6 +/- 3.1 mumol/L) were 40% higher than in the follicular phase (16.7 +/- 1.1 mumol/L) (p less than 0.05). Urinary kynurenine excretion in the luteal phase (81.6 +/- 14.4 mumol/24 h) was 28% greater than in the follicular phase (63.9 +/- 13.0 mumol/24 h) (p less than 0.05).

We developed a methodology to separate and concentrate the NPN fraction for further analysis. NPN was initially separated from other milk components by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. Further isolation and separation was carried out by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Molecular masses of unknown peaks were determined by using known molecular mass markers and standards. The methodologies developed lead to the discrete separation of NPN from other milk compounds and can be particularly valuable for isolating peptides in HM.\r"

The sera from the lean (n = 14) and obese (n = 12) children under habitual diet contained similar adipogenic activity. However, when the obese children underwent a weight-reduction program for 3 wk (600 kcal/d), the potential of their sera to stimulate glycero-phosphate dehydrogenase, an index of adipogenic activity, was significantly reduced by 32% (p less than 0.01). Similarly, the mitogenic activity of these sera decreased significantly (202 +/- 15 vs 231 +/- 27 micrograms per dish, p less than 0.01). Testing pooled sera from the different groups in cultured rat adipocyte precursor cells gave similar results. This study suggests that human childhood-onset obesity is not accompanied by increased circulatory factors involved in the formation of new fat cells. The adipogenic and mitogenic activity of sera from obese children may be influenced by long-term dietary restriction.\r"

Weanling rabbits were exposed for 6 wk to a diet containing 0.25% cholesterol, allowed to recover for 9 wk (at least 3 wk after normalization of plasma cholesterol), and subsequently rechallenged with cholesterol to determine atherogenic response. Enhanced activity of acyl-CoA-cholesterol-acyl-transferase in aorta induced by cholesterol feeding persisted even after normalization of serum cholesterol. When rechallenged with cholesterol for 3 mo, these animals displayed significantly (p less than 0.05) increased development of aortic atherosclerosis and accumulation of cholesterol esters when compared with control animals. Exposure to cholesterol in early life appears to cause persistent changes in cholesterol ester synthetic enzyme activity in aorta after normalization of plasma cholesterol and these residual effects might increase aortic response to subsequent cholesterol challenge in adult life.\r"

The estimates obtained by these two different approaches are consistent and equal to or in most cases considerably higher than current values for the upper range of the individual amino acid requirements in healthy adults. From these estimates of the obligatory, or minimum, rates of amino acid oxidation, the minimum requirements for indispensable amino acids are predicted. These are about two to three times higher than current requirement figures. Experimental support for these higher requirement figures is presented, based on published 13C-labeled amino acid tracer studies. When these revised estimates are expressed per unit of protein need, the amino acid pattern is similar to the 1985 Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University amino acid scoring pattern for the preschool child (aged 2-5 y).\r"

IGT men were fatter than normal men on five measures; diabetic men were fatter on four and group differences were marginally significant (p greater than or equal to 0.03).

The bean diet resulted in higher concentrations of acetate and total SCFA in cecal digesta, lower concentrations of butyrate, a larger SCFA pool size, and a more acidic pH than did the bran diet. Thus, we conclude that SCFA concentrations and acidity of the digesta are directly related and that dietary fibers can affect simultaneously several variables that are implicated as factors influencing colonic health.\r"

The average age at presentation was 54 years (range, 23-83). No patient had a recurrence. No neuroendocrine syndrome was found in any patient or patient's family. Immunohistochemical stains in 33 cases yielded the following (proportion positive): S-100 protein 94%, synaptophysin 94%, neuron-specific enolase 94%, pancreatic polypeptide 88%, somatostatin 75%, chromogranin 72%, neurofilament protein 64%, keratin 52%, leu-enkephalin 48%, serotonin (one case), and gastrin (one case). Antisera usually stained one or two of the three major cell types. Pancreatic-type tissue was identified in or near 28 tumors, including the pyloric and jejunal lesions and two in the distal duodenum.

This causes difficulties and errors. A simplified system for interpretation of INRs with the range of thromboplastins widely used in North America is therefore presented, which obviates the need for mathematic procedures for the derivation of INR equivalents. It should thus facilitate the application of the INR system and of safer therapeutic ranges.\r"

Emerging evidence suggests that a similar series of lesions develops in the anal canal after exposure to the same HPV types. In situ hybridization was performed with the use of biotinylated DNA probes to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, so as to determine the frequency of HPV DNA in 45 perianal and/or anal condylomata, 6 anal intraepithelial neoplasias, and 13 anal squamous cell carcinomas. Of the 33 perianal and/or anal condylomata in which HPV DNA was detected, 13 contained HPV 6 and 11, 12 HPV 6, 7 HPV 11, and 1 HPV 6, 11, and 18. Two of four severe anal dysplasias contained HPV 16, whereas one case each of mild and moderate anal dysplasia contained HPV 6. No HPV DNA was detected in the anal squamous cell carcinomas. The study demonstrated the presence of HPV DNA in 73% of condylomata and 67% of anal dysplasias. The observations suggest that the cloacogenically derived anal epithelium is susceptible to infection by the same HPV types as infect the similarly derived epithelium of the lower female genital tract and that these HPV types result in some similar lesions, i.e., condylomata and dysplasias in both sites. A role in the genesis of anal cancer was not found in this study.\r"

FNAs from ILC had some overlapping features with ALH and LCIS but were generally more cellular and had a higher proportion of noncohesive single cells with more nuclear atypia and pleomorphism. Intracytoplasmic lumina were consistently found in invasive and noninvasive lobular lesions and may represent the most useful cytologic clue for their recognition. FNAs with the above features are atypical and suggestive of ALH or LCIS. Excisional biopsy should be performed in such cases to confirm the presence of ALH or LCIS and to evaluate for ILC.\r"

Patients with breast carcinomas in whom metastasis to the contralateral breast developed were excluded from this study. This series consisted of 17 women and 3 men, ranging in age from 28 to 63 years (mean, 49 years). The tumors included oat cell carcinoma (three), melanoma (three), ovarian serous carcinoma (one), bronchogenic adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma (four and two, respectively), lymphoma (two), carcinoid (two), transitional cell carcinoma (one), plasma cell myeloma (one), and rhabdomyosarcoma (one). In two patients, the breast mass was the first manifestation of an extramammary cancer (two adenocarcinoma of the lung). Eleven patients died of disseminated cancer shortly after the breast metastasis was diagnosed. In most cases, the aspirates displayed the cytologic features characteristic of the primary tumors, thereby establishing the metastatic nature of the neoplasm. In four cases (two carcinoids, one myeloma, and one rhabdomyosarcoma), the cytologic features were difficult to differentiate from a primary breast carcinoma; however, the final diagnosis was established by electron microscopic examination and immunocytochemical studies on the aspirates. One case (adenocarcinoma of the lung) was misdiagnosed as primary breast carcinoma on both FNA and mastectomy specimen. Because metastatic neoplasms in the breast may mimic primary breast tumors, the authors recommend the following: (1) Evaluation of FNA of breast should be done with complete knowledge of the patient's clinical history. (2) The possibility of metastasis should be suspected in lesions with unusual cytologic patterns. (3) Ancillary studies on FNA can be helpful in interpreting selected cases.\r"

Transbronchial aspiration correctly identified 36% of malignant cases compared with 35% identified by wash, 39% by brush, 25% by sputum, and 59% by forceps biopsy. The overall accuracy of the techniques was 56% for aspiration, 48% for wash, 56% for brush, 35% for sputum, and 71% for forceps biopsy. Malignant cases were associated with cellular transbronchial aspirates, good preservation of cell detail, and a high degree of cytologic/histologic correlation regarding cell type. Transbronchial fine-needle aspiration has the potential for improving the diagnostic ability of bronchoscopy. However, the high incidence of false negative diagnoses is the main limitation for the technique, and the responsible factors are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A method for clamp-freezing of small biopsies for ultrathin cryosectioning is described. A formvar film is used to support the specimen before freezing with a pair of pliers, precooled in liquid nitrogen. This method makes it possible to align the piece of tissue close to a drop of standard solution and freeze the two simultaneously. After clamping, the flat, frozen sample contains both the piece of tissue and the standard in one solid block, which may thus be sectioned as a whole. The method has been used in the surgical theater, yielding good results with needle biopsies of the prostate and cystoscopically obtained biopsies of bladder tumors. The time lapse between excision and freezing may be less than 30 seconds, which represents a great improvement compared with the far more time-consuming mincing of tissue and mounting of the pieces on metal pins. From the frozen specimen, a large number of sections with good morphologic characteristics may be produced. The method was evaluated with the use of rat liver and lactating mammary tissue. Directly frozen tissue with intact blood supply was compared with biopsies prepared as described. Redistribution of Ca could not be demonstrated in either specimen type. However, the results indicate that the monovalent ions are far more mobile, and a significant increase of the Na:K ratios was observed in the biopsies compared with directly frozen tissue.\r"

The counter, R-1000 of Sysmex-TOA Medical Electronics Company, Kobe, Japan, is based on the principles of flow cytometry. Reticulocytes are detected as fluorescent cells stained with a basic dye, auramine O, under argon-laser light. The automated count had high correlation to the manual count (r = 0.941). Linearity and reproducibility were both high. About 60 specimens were tested in one hour. Not only the reticulocyte percentage and count but also the maturity of reticulocytes was found from the intensity of the fluorescence, whether high, moderate, or slight. Normal reference values were 0.007 +/- 0.0055 (0.70 +/- 0.55%) for the reticulocytes, (4.63 +/- 1.09) X 10(9)/L for the reticulocyte count, 2.3 +/- 1.9% for highly fluorescent cells, 18.7 +/- 5.1% for moderately fluorescent cells, and 78.8 +/- 6.6% for cells with slight fluorescence. In patients with suppressed bone marrow function, such as is caused by chemotherapy, the reticulocyte fraction and count were low, and cells with slight fluorescence increased. In patients in whom bone marrow function was stimulated, such as with hemolytic anemia, the reticulocyte percentage, reticulocyte count, and highly fluorescent cells were high. Patients with chronic renal failure being treated by hemodialysis had a similar reticulocyte pattern to that in hemolytic anemia except that the reticulocyte count was decreased. Results for elderly patients were not different from those of healthy young controls. Some patients with a normal reticulocyte count and percentage had numerous highly fluorescent cells, perhaps because of hemolytic anemia not yet identified. Automated reticulocyte counting provides reliable data, so such measurement should be useful for analysis of the kinetics of red blood cells and for the study of the pathogenesis of anemia.\r"

The authors used a highly sensitive monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay that allows quantitation with comparable precision of all four subclasses. They analyzed 28 sera obtained from 22 nephrotic patients during relapse (n = 16) and/or remission (n = 12). The mean ages of the two groups were similar. IgG1 and IgG2 were significantly decreased during relapse compared with remission, whereas IgG3 and IgG4 were not significantly different. This pattern of asymmetric depression of IgG subclasses supports a cause other than urinary losses in the pathogenesis of this abnormality.\r"

Leukocyte esterase activity becomes detectable at a concentration of 15 white blood cells per high-power field (WBCs/HPF). Proteinuria is nonspecifically related to pyuria and detects a minimum concentration of 6 WBCs/HPF, and the hemoglobin reaction detects 6 red blood cells/HPF. Most false negative reactions are associated with bacteriuria. A positive chemical reagent strip test can be safely and effectively used as a prerequisite for routine urine microscopic examination.\r"

The histories of these patients were reviewed retrospectively, and the median follow-up in Groups A, B, and C was nine, ten, and nine years, respectively. Disease progression, defined as the development of cytopenia(s) (hemoglobin less than or equal to 100 g/L [less than or equal to 10 g/dL] or platelet count less than 100 X 10(9)/L [less than 100 X 10(3) microL]) and/or the development of newly palpable splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, was least in Group B (6%) versus Group A (34%) versus Group C (30%) (P = 0.08). The incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia among patients who had protein electrophoresis performed was 7% in Group B versus 46% in Group A versus 45% in Group C (P = 0.036). The authors conclude that adult patients with B-CLL in whom sIg is undetectable or weakly expressed in less than 20% of the circulating lymphocytes may have an even more indolent clinical course than those with more widespread sIg expression.\r"

The sera were from 16 pregnant women with Rh antibodies, drawn at the time of amniotic fluid analysis. They compared the predictive value (PV) of the MMAs and the delta OD 450 of amniotic fluid in forecasting the need for transfusing the infant. The PV of the delta OD 450 result in Liley zone mid II-III was 100%, but in zones 0 to low II it was only 60% (13 samples from ten women were in these zones but four babies required transfusion). In contrast, the PV of a positive (greater than 20% reactivity) MMA was 91% (one false positive result) and the PV of a negative MMA was 100%. Thus, the MMA was more efficient than amniotic fluid analysis at predicting hemolytic disease of the newborn severe enough to require transfusion. The noninvasive MMA could be used as a screening test, reducing the number of amniocenteses or ultrasound evaluations performed on Rh-sensitized women.\r"

The two groups did not differ significantly in their intake of these nutrients or the number of deficiency states for intake (less than 67% RDA). Low serum transketolase (thiamin; p less than 0.055), red blood cell (RBC) folate (p less than 0.06), and serum vitamin B-12 (p less than 0.05) levels occurred more often in SDAT patients than in CN subjects. Individuals in both groups who used multivitamin supplements had significantly higher biochemical values for thiamine (p less than 0.03), riboflavin (p less than 0.01), and vitamin B-12 (p less than 0.003) than nonsupplement users. Because of the differences in vitamin B-12 and RBC folate levels between groups, a retrospective analysis was performed on a larger group of subjects drawn from a geriatric assessment clinic. Patients with SDAT had significantly lower serum vitamin B-12 (p less than 0.01) and lower RBC folate (p less than 0.03) values than CN subjects. Which mean values for vitamin B-12 and RBC folate were grouped by degree of impairment in SDAT subjects, vitamin B-12 was significantly lower in mildly and moderately impaired subjects than in those with normal cognition. Mean values for both nutrients did not differ significantly between severely impaired and CN subjects. There was a significant quadratic relationship between cognitive impairment and biochemical values for vitamin B-12.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The forces stabilizing structured regions of hyaluronic acid (HA), a major component of extracellular matrix, were measured. The free energy of stability associated with structured regions within human HA was determined by potentiometric titration. A plot of free energy versus temperature demonstrated that the secondary structure was most stable at 25 degrees C and was destabilized at temperatures near 50 degrees C. In the presence of 5 mM CaCl2, the free energy of stability of the structured regions was reduced by 30 cal/mole. Classical light scattering and viscosity measurements confirmed the impact of calcium on HA. CaCl2 (5 mM) reduced the radius of gyration of HA. Above concentrations of 3 mM calcium, the viscosity of 0.1% HA solutions was reduced sharply. The ability of cells to secrete calcium, combined with the exquisite sensitivity of HA to calcium, may permit cell-mediated modification of the extracellular matrix and thus may facilitate cell motility.\r"

Prospective studies have documented changes in interventricular septa of babies exposed to these drugs. Histologic changes have been reproduced in animal models and in vitro similar to those seen in infants with myocardial disease caused by beta-mimetic therapy. The mechanism of beta-mimetic toxicity appears to be increased myocardial intracellular calcium leading to overexcitation and cell necrosis. Since serious fetal cardiovascular effects may occur with beta-mimetic use, benefits should clearly outweigh risks before these drugs are administered.\r"

The protective effect of oral contraceptives seen in other studies was observed only in subgroups of our study population. Women who had breastfed their children had decreased risk, but the number of months of breastfeeding was not related to risk. Incomplete pregnancies did not provide the protection seen for live births. A family history of ovarian cancer and a medical history of breast cancer were both strong risk factors. None of the nonreproductive factors that we examined, including childhood illnesses, tobacco and alcohol consumption, obesity, and selected adult diseases, was convincingly associated with risk.\r"

There were no differences in the incidence of neonatal morbidity or mortality among the modes of delivery. External version was associated with a higher failure rate than primary breech extraction (p less than 0.01). External version was associated with complications (fetal distress, cord prolapse, and compound presentation) that were not seen in the other two groups.

Previous spontaneous abortions were not related to risk, although those with a prior induced abortion were at elevated risk, particularly if two or more abortions were involved (odds ratio = 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 5.7). A history of having sought medical advice for infertility was associated with reduced risk (odds ratio = 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.8), but those who reported use of herbal medicines during a first trimester of a previous pregnancy were at excess risk (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.6). In addition, a statistically significant trend in risk was observed with years of oral contraceptive use (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 6.9 for greater than or equal to 4 years of use). Dietary habits and family histories of cancer or trophoblastic disease were not related to risk in this study.\r"

Study variables were perceived fetal movement, fetal heart rate, and fetal heart rate pattern. Observer- and patient-perceived fetal movement responses were noted in most cases but were slightly more common in term patients (group A: + fetal movement, patient 87.5%/observer 87.5%) group B: + fetal movement, patient 96.7%/observer 90%). Baseline changes in fetal heart rate (greater than or equal to 10 beats/min) were observed in 46% of preterm fetuses and 70% of term fetuses. Tachycardia (fetal heart rate greater than 160 beats/min) was a common finding in both groups. In group A, tachycardia after vibratory acoustic stimulation persisted more than 1 minute in 29.2% and more than 5 minutes in 12.5% of patients. In group B tachycardia beyond 1 and 5 minutes was noted in 73.3% and 50% of patients, respectively. A significant shift to \"awake\" fetal heart rate patterns occurred in both groups; 29% to 79% was noted in group A (p less than 0.001) and 46.7% to 90% in group B (p less than 0.001). When vibratory acoustic stimulation was used, the high occurrence of increased baseline, tachycardia, and emergence of unusual fetal heart rate patterns must be recognized to adequately interpret fetal heart rate tracings.\r"

There is a general consensus that the major obstetric indications responsible for the rising rate are dystocia, fetal distress, breech presentation, and previous cesarean delivery. However, the role of sociologic or nonmedical factors has not been established. This retrospective study examines the effect of the physician's age, experience, gender, and practice setting (solo versus group practice) on the cesarean birth rate. The analysis is based on 6327 private deliveries performed by 48 attending obstetrician/gynecologists at a New York City Hospital from January 1983 through December 1985. Although no significant differences were found according to the gender or practice setting of the physicians, older, more experienced physicians performed significantly fewer cesarean sections for dystocia and a higher percentage of forceps deliveries and breech extractions. These results suggest that physician characteristics may affect the type of delivery that is performed.\r"

Advantages of this technique are the excellent blood supply to the ileocecal region and the long vascular pedicle. The supplemental application of terminal ileum for prolongation of the cecal vaginoplasty allows for tensionless anastomosis between the neovagina and the vulva, even in patients with difficult anatomic conditions. A detailed description of the operative technique and indications for ileocecal and cecal vaginoplasty are presented, and the techniques in current use for vaginal replacement are reviewed and discussed.\r"

In the construction of expert systems, knowledge engineers have exploited this fact in devising heuristic rules that mimic the standard practice among such personnel (i.e., experts). This article suggests that the expert system designer should not stop at the level of the standard operating procedure heuristic but should instead investigate the reasons that the standard procedures have become standard. Because the experts in a field often do not understand the reasons for the standard operating procedures of their profession, this effort not only rewards the system designer but the expert as well. Because medical training does not always emphasize the logical reasoning underlying certain standard operating procedures, the ability to perform this reasoning is especially important in medicine. Further, a medical expert system for consultation or education would make a valuable impact by incorporating such knowledge and inference rules. This article investigates the development of a computerized medical expert system that applies the principles of artificial intelligence by limiting the number of questions and tests to find the solution for an ill-defined complex problem. Finally, we describe a logic program that tests the basic ideas.\r"

For thigh circumference and estimated weight, the comparable values were +/- 15% and +/- 16%, respectively. The head circumference at birth was predicted without bias; the random error was approximately +/- 5% (94% of percent differences). Weight, abdominal circumference, and thigh circumference were systematically overestimated (3.1%, 14.9%, and 11.3%, respectively) as a result of differences in prenatal and postnatal measurement procedures. After correction for systematic errors, these parameters could be predicted with random errors of -11.5% to 7.2% (weight), -12.8% to 5.4% (abdominal circumference), and -15.3% to 10.0% (thigh circumference). Growth Potential Realization Index values were found to have means of approximately 100% and ranges from 91% to 118%. These results are similar to those for singletons and indicate that individual assessment of growth in twins can be carried out with the same methods used for singletons.\r"

Mortality differences between males and females and blacks and whites were analyzed. Survival for females was higher than males between 500 and 1500 gm and higher for blacks than whites between 650 and 1500 gm. Between 1500 and 2500 gm, no significant effects of birth weight, race, or sex were observed, with survival remaining stable at approximately 95% across all combinations of variables.\r"

Mean baseline movement in fetuses found as neonates to have intrauterine growth retardation (N = 18) was significantly lower than that of normal fetuses (N = 34). Fetal body movements and breathing movements increased significantly after hyperoxia in the intrauterine growth retardation group but not in the normal group. Increases of more than 75% over baseline for fetal breathing and more than 250% over baseline for fetal body movements yielded a sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 94%, positive predicative value of 83%, and negative predicative value of 80%. Maternal hyperoxia during biophysical testing may improve the accuracy of detecting intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

Temporary analgesia and mild sedation were apparent in each case. The cumulative dose varied in accordance with maternal needs (mean, 140 +/- 42 micrograms; range, 50 mcg to 600 micrograms). Apart from a brief decrease in fetal heart rate variability that lasted 30 minutes, no worrisome pattern was apparent from exposure to fentanyl citrate. Pediatric examinations were performed without knowledge of analgesic therapy on infants exposed to fentanyl citrate and those not exposed to analgesics. No differences were found in frequencies of newborn depressed respirations, low Apgar scores, or neurologic and adaptive capabilities at two hours and 24 hours postnatally. With the use of the described dosing schedule, fentanyl citrate was helpful during labor and did not cause immediate or prolonged hazards to the mother and unborn infant.\r"

Penetration of spermatozoa was restored when the zona pellucida pretreated with wheat germ agglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin-I were rinsed with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (wheat germ agglutinin inhibitor) and D-galactose (Ricinus communis agglutinin inhibitor), respectively. Conversely, the blocking effect of concanavalin A on sperm penetration was not reversed by treatment with D-mannose (concanavalin A inhibitor). Furthermore, pretreatment of spermatozoa with D-mannose (50 mmol/L) completely inhibited sperm penetration through the zona pellucida. However, sperm penetration was clearly demonstrated when the zona pellucida was pretreated with D-mannose. These data suggest that D-mannose residues are essential in, or sterically closely related to, the sperm receptor site on the human zona pellucida.\r"

At normal blood glucose levels, the electroencephalogram decreased in amplitude during ischemia. At elevated blood glucose levels the electroencephalographic amplitude was much less attenuated by ischemia although Fast Fourier Transforms revealed a shift toward slower frequencies. Under either normal or elevated blood glucose conditions, ischemia caused cerebral oxygen consumption to decrease, glucose uptake to increase, and a net efflux of lactate to occur. Elevated blood glucose appears to help maintain electroencephalographic activity during ischemia, perhaps by fueling additional anaerobic energy production. The relationship between the electroencephalogram, brain metabolism, and brain damage remains to be defined.\r"

Maternal and fetal arterial pressure, fetal venous pressure, intrauterine pressure, and uterine electromyogram activity were monitored continuously. Prostaglandin E2 was infused at a delivery rate that caused a minimal 5 mm Hg increase in intrauterine pressure with definite contraction-like pressure spikes and associated uterine electromyogram activity. Forskolin (10 mg in 30% ethanol) or ethanol (vehicle) was then infused for 20 minutes. The prostaglandin E2 challenge was repeated 3 minutes later and again every 30 minutes over a 2 1/2-hour period. Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Infusion of ethanol (n = 2) had no apparent effect on either the intrauterine pressure or the uterine electromyogram response to prostaglandin E2 challenge. Forskolin infusion (n = 5) caused an attenuation of the intrauterine pressure response to prostaglandin E2 for 93 minutes. This effect was greatest 33 minutes after the infusion ended when the integrated pressure signal was 37% of the initial prostaglandin E2 response. The forskolin infusion had no effect on uterine electromyogram response to prostaglandin E2. We conclude that forskolin causes an uncoupling of excitation from contraction in the intact near-term ovine uterus.\r"

Glucose tolerance before and after gestation was not affected by diet in the short-term study. At 19 days' gestation, glucose tolerance had deteriorated in the pregnant rats that were fed with 22% fat diet. In the long-term study, abnormal glucose tolerance was observed before mating in rats that were fed the 22% fat diet. Tolerance improved during gestation and post partum, but still was not normal. Fertility and pup survival were significantly (50%) reduced in rats that were fed the 22% fat diet. These findings suggest that either short-term or long-term feeding of a 22% fat diet to BHE rats results in a model for human gestational diabetes that might be worthy of further study.\r"

  ".W": "Infusion of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor 4-aminoantipyrine at a rate of 20 mg/min via the fetal tarsal vein during normothermic conditions (ambient temperatures = 24 degrees C) significantly decreased the concentrations of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha in maternal and fetal arterial plasma and in uterine and umbilical vein plasma. The infusion was associated with a small but significant rise in fetal temperature and a fall in fetal arterial pH. Respiratory alkalosis developed in fetuses during hyperthermia by raising the ambient temperature to 43 degrees C for 8 hours. In contrast, infusion of 4-aminoantipyrine during hyperthermia produced fetal metabolic acidosis as indicated by a fall in fetal pH and an increase in PaCO2, even though the ewe remained hypocapnic. Four of the 10 fetuses died during or shortly after the 4-aminoantipyrine infusion during hyperthermia. These results indicate that uteroplacental prostaglandin synthesis is essential to allow the fetus to adapt to an increase in body temperature and suggests that prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors should be used with caution during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 71 breech deliveries after previous cesarean was done to determine the need for repeat cesarean section. Twenty-four (33.8%) women were allocated to the elective repeat cesarean section group and forty-seven (66.2%) patients were allocated to a trial of labor group. Thirty-seven (78.7%) were delivered of their infants vaginally. A total of 37 of the 71 women (52.1%) had successful vaginal deliveries. Neonatal morbidity did not differ for women who were delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. Maternal febrile morbidity was significantly higher in the cesarean section group than in the vaginal delivery group (p less than 0.001). On the basis of these data, a trial of labor seems reasonable in carefully selected cases of breech presentation after a previous cesarean section.\r"
