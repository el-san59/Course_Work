The efficacy of therapy was assessed by comparing it with the results in the nontreated patients, or with our previous study in which we administered 2 million units per day of interferon. The treatment was discontinued in four patients 8 wk after start of therapy because there was no improvement in serum aminotransferase levels. The remaining 22 patients completed the treatment schedule, and their aminotransferase values showed significant decreases throughout the therapy and during the follow-up period, compared with their baseline levels or the nontreated group. After 3 months of follow-up, normal aminotransferase activities were seen in eight treated patients. In four of these patients, liver histology showed a marked improvement in inflammation and parenchymal cell necrosis. Percent change from pretreatment level of serum 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity was significantly higher in the aminotransferase-normalized group than in the nonnormalized group during therapy. The present study suggested that a higher dose of alpha-interferon could control the disease activity more effectively in patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

At operation, the esophageal wall was adherent to the surrounding tissues at the level of the stricture, and the esophageal wall appeared scarred and felt hard. Pathologic examination of the resected specimen showed many submucosal cystic spaces associated with mucosal depressions. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of esophageal intramural diverticulosis was made. However, some cystic spaces ran parallel to the long axis of the esophagus, and one had penetrated the muscular layers and led into the inflammatory mass. Muscularis mucosa surrounded the cystic spaces, and inflammation was slight. These findings suggest that the etiology of the esophageal diverticula of this case was a congenital malformation.\r"

On days 8 through 11, they received 30 micrograms/d of growth hormone and twice this amount on days 11 through 15. Growth hormone had no significant effects on the plasma concentration of glucose, cortisol, or glucagon but caused a 50% increase in insulin and a 250% increase in somatomedin C concentrations. A positive nitrogen balance of 2 g/d due to growth hormone was probably mediated by insulin. Growth hormone-induced increases in energy expenditure and fat oxidation and decrease in glucose oxidation cannot be accounted for by insulin. The ability of growth hormone to improve nitrogen balance may be particularly important for malnourished patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who, because of their pulmonary insufficiency, are intolerant of excess nutrients.\r"

Patients (N = 419) with two or more functional impairments or a terminal illness were randomized to hospital-based home care (n = 211) or customary care (n = 208). Functional status, satisfaction with care, and morale were measured at baseline and at 1 and 6 months after discharge from the hospital; health care utilization was tracked for 6 months. Findings included significantly higher (0.1 on a three-point scale) patient and caregiver satisfaction with care at 1 month and lower Veterans Administration and private sector hospital costs ($3000 vs $4245) for the experimental group. Net per person health care costs were also 13% lower in the experimental group. We conclude that this model of hospital-based home care is cost-effective and that its expansion to cover these two patient groups throughout the Veterans Administration system can improve patient care at no additional cost.\r"

The first group comprised 13 patients who had taken low dose (average 3 mg/kg per day) CyA for an average period of 2.5 years. Seven of the 13 had a normal GFR of 108 (77-121) ml/min (median; range). In the other six patients the GFR was low at 63 (50-77) ml/min and CyA was discontinued for periods ranging from 3 to 17 weeks. The GFR rose in all six patients, to 79 (60-91) ml/min; this change was significant (P less than 0.05). The six patients restarted CyA because their psoriasis recurred and after a mean interval of 15 weeks the GFR had fallen in all six to 63 (46-80) ml/min (P less than 0.05) and the ERPF decreased from 339 (231-414) ml/min to 244 (177-321) ml/min (P less than 0.05). In the second group of 11 patients measurements were made prior to starting CyA and after taking CyA for a mean of 9 weeks. The GFR fell in eight out of 11 subjects, the GFR for the 11 patients being 117 (72-128) ml/min before taking CyA and 97 (51-122) ml/min after CyA (P less than 0.02). The ERPF was measured in nine of the 11 patients and fell in seven of the nine. The ERPF for the nine patients before CyA was 490 (296-642) ml/min and for the 11 patients after CyA was 410 (195-543) ml/min (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The upper third was injected only in cases where the catheter could not be negotiated further (e.g. abnormalities in the course of the spermatic vein or its drainage into the intrarenal veins). The amount of sclerosing material was predetermined fluoroscopically using contrast material. Occasionally, in cases of high catheter positioning, the Varicocid was injected fractionally. The amount injected was always between 1 and 3 ml. Of 80 patients studied 1 year later, varicoceles were still present in 3 (4%). The best results were achieved in patients with small varicoceles (Grade I), normal testicular volume and normal FSH levels; 29% showed an improvement in sperm count and 27% an increase in sperm motility, while sperm morphology improved in only 7%.

The success of GRID therapy was based on the fact that small volumes of tissues could tolerate high doses of radiation. Since the development of megavoltage radiation and skin sparing, GRID therapy has been abandoned. In a pilot study, the authors adapted the principles of GRID therapy to megavoltage photon beams to treat patients with massive tumors or recurrent tumors after tolerance doses of radiation. Twenty-two patients have been entered in the study. All patients were symptomatic and had exhaustive conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy approaches to treatment. A 50:50 GRID (open to closed areas) was utilized, and a prescribed dose of 1000 to 1500 cGy to the open areas was given using a single photon field. In four patients, a second GRID treated was delivered at a split course interval of 4 weeks. The follow-up in these patients ranges from 1 month to 18 months. The results of treatment have been remarkable with 20 of 22 patients achieving dramatic relief of severe symptoms, and several patients showing significant objective regression. No acute effects have been observed, including those patients having large volumes of the abdomen irradiated. No unusual skin or subcutaneous early or late damage has been observed in follow-up.\r"

At 5 years the rate of breast preservation was 94%. Cosmetic results were excellent or good for most patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 95% for Stage I, 94% for Stage IIA, 80% for Stage IIB, 60% for Stage IIIA, and 58% for Stage IIIB.

The CLL had mu lambda surface immunoglobulin (sIg) whereas the DLC had mu kappa sIg. However, the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement and surface marker analysis demonstrated that both CLL and DLC had identical rearrangement patterns of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) and identical surface markers CD5+, CD19+, and CD20+. These facts imply that in this case the two malignancies are of single clonal origin initially, and that different sIg of CLL and DLC do not, therefore, necessarily indicate the biclonality of these malignancies. The origin of DLC in Richter's syndrome remains controversial. This case suggests difficulty in concluding the biclonality of these malignancies. For a conclusion on clonality to be definitive, there is a need for cloning and nucleotide sequencing of rearranged Ig genes in more patients with Richter's syndrome.\r"

Cytogenetic studies excluded Philadelphia + chronic myeloid leukemia and molecular analysis of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) revealed no evidence of clonal gene rearrangement. Nine similar cases of coexistent CNL and paraproteinemia have been identified in the literature and attention is drawn to the disproportionate excess of lambda light chain restriction in this subset of patients. Evidence supporting a clonal origin of CNL is considered and the nature of the relationship between the chronic myeloid expansion and the development of multiple myeloma is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Between December 1983 and December 1987, there were 44 patients with bulky, nonresectable squamous cell carcinomas of the gynecologic tract (cervix, 36; vagina, eight) who were treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1g/m2 given by continuous intravenous infusion on days 1 through 4 and mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 given intravenously on day 1. External-beam irradiation was started on day 1 with a total calculated dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions employed. This was followed by brachytherapy. With a mean follow-up of 30.3 months and a median of 28 months, local control has been achieved in 32 of 44 patients (73%). The overall response rate was 88% (3-month partial response, 43%; 3-month complete response, 45%; 8-month partial response, 15%; 8-month complete response, 73%). Analysis of complications by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria did not demonstrate an increase in acute or late complications.\r"

  ".W": "The role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a sensitive tumor marker for cancer of the prostate, has yet to be defined in patients treated with radiotherapy. To evaluate this, PSA and acid phosphatase (AP) were measured prospectively in 110 sequential patients who presented with locoregional carcinoma of the prostate and in whom radiotherapy was to be definitive treatment. Therapy was divided into the following treatment groups: external-beam radiotherapy alone (EBRT), EBRT with brachytherapy (EBRT + B), and hormone therapy either pre-EBRT or post-EBRT (EBRT + H). All patients have been followed for 1 to 17 months and a total of 521 posttreatment PSA determinations have been made. In 91 of 110 patients (83%) PSA was elevated pretreatment and correlated with clinical stage and subsequent relapse. There was no association with Gleason grade, assigned treatment group, or lymph node involvement. Acid phosphatase was elevated in only 31% of the patients initially and had no predictive value in subsequent failure. Nine patients have developed local and/or distant recurrence. None of the patients who failed had their PSA return to normal whereas 74 of 101 (73%) of the remainder have done so. Levels of PSA that do not return to normal during follow-up probably indicate active disease, often without evidence of clinical relapse. The authors conclude that PSA is a useful tumor marker for monitoring response to radiotherapy and may be a predictor of eventual failure thus identifying patients eligible for early intervention therapy as and when it becomes available.\r"

All clinical and laboratory variables that were collected at baseline or during perfusion for TIMI I were evaluated by the current study. Via stepwise discriminant analysis, 7 variables were closely associated with perfusion status at 90 minutes (listed in the order of their discriminant effect): baseline grade of stenosis in the infarct-related coronary artery, whether nausea was present during the infusion, baseline aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) concentration, whether arrhythmias were present during the infusion, baseline fibrinogen concentration, baseline partial thromboplastin time, and baseline diastolic blood pressure. Baseline severity of stenosis and the likelihood of there being reperfusion were inversely related. Eighty-four percent of patients with adequate perfusion after 90 minutes of t-PA infusion were classified correctly, but only 50% of those without perfusion at 90 minutes were classified correctly. In addition, since 70% of the TIMI I patients, on average, did achieve perfusion, the use of these 7 variables added little predictive information. Our findings suggest that 1) there is as yet no practical way to predict reperfusion after t-PA therapy and 2) the severity of coronary stenoses, if known ahead of time, should be considered when selecting patients for thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Because the intrarenal tissue renin-angiotensin system may modulate renal responses to atrial natriuretic peptide, we examined the effect of dietary NaCl loading on the responses of isolated perfused kidneys from normal rats to atrial natriuretic peptide, before and after the addition of angiotensin II receptor antagonists or angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors to the perfusate. 2. Atrial natriuretic peptide increased the glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion of kidneys from NaCl-loaded rats. The addition of angiotensin receptor antagonists or converting enzyme inhibitors partially reversed the increments in glomerular filtration rate but not the increments in sodium excretion, leading to an increased fractional sodium excretion. In the absence of atrial natriuretic peptide, these agents did not affect glomerular filtration or sodium excretion. Kidneys from NaCl-restricted rats did not respond to atrial natriuretic peptide or to the inhibitors and antagonists, either separately or in combination. 3. After NaCl loading, the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system may augment the glomerular response to atrial natriuretic peptide while simultaneously inhibiting the natriuretic response to atrial natriuretic peptide. However, activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system is not responsible for the refractoriness of kidneys from salt-restricted rats to atrial natriuretic peptide.\r"

  ".W": "1. The increase in glomerular filtration rate after a protein meal is believed to be mediated by hormonal factors. Since natriuresis is often observed after a protein meal, it was postulated that the increase in glomerular filtration rate after a protein meal might be mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide. 2. Subjects were given a low, medium or high protein meal. Fluid intake was controlled so as to avoid significant extracellular fluid volume expansion. It was found that the creatinine clearance, the urea excretion, the fractional sodium excretion and the potassium excretion were elevated in all subjects after protein meals (P less than 0.05). These effects were not observed in subjects given a carbohydrate control meal. 3. The plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations remained unchanged in all subjects except those given a high protein meal (P less than 0.05). There was no significant relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and creatinine clearance before or after a protein meal. 4. The data suggest that a high protein meal induces a minor increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, whereas a low or medium protein meal does not. It is unlikely that the change in creatinine clearance after a protein meal can be explained by a change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels.\r"

As an initial investigation of the possible contribution of sex hormones to these differences, we studied skin and forearm blood flow during the natural changes in hormone levels which occur during the menstrual cycle. 2. Thirty-one healthy female volunteers were studied. The effect of a standardized finger cooling test (immersion of a gloved hand in a 16 degrees C water bath) on finger skin temperature and on laser Doppler flux in the finger, and forearm blood flow (strain gauge venous occlusion plethysmography) was assessed at four different times during one cycle: during menstruation, 1 day before ovulation, 2 days after ovulation and at the mid-luteal phase. Test days were determined by daily measurements of basal body temperature and were confirmed afterwards by determinations of serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, 17 beta-oestradiol and progesterone. 3. Peripheral skin circulation varied significantly within one menstrual cycle. The extremes were a mean finger skin temperature of 25.9 +/- 3.0 degrees C in the luteal phase compared with 28.4 +/- 3.7 degrees C in the pre-ovulatory phase (P = 0.002). The respective values for the mean laser Doppler flux were 18.4 +/- 10.9 compared with 29.2 +/- 16.4 arbitrary units (P = 0.003). 4. Baseline forearm muscle blood flow also varied significantly (P = 0.04) within one menstrual cycle, with low values in the menstrual phase compared with the other phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ganglioside administration to nondiabetic and streptozocin-induced diabetic rats on sciatic nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, polyphosphoinositide (PPI) turnover, and protein phosphorylation was investigated. Gangliosides were injected (10 mg/kg body wt i.p.) for 10 or 30 days beginning 20 days after induction of diabetes. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was reduced nearly 50% in diabetic nerve and was restored to normal by both ganglioside treatments. The elevated levels of fructose and sorbitol and depressed content of myoinositol in diabetic nerve were unaffected by 30 days of ganglioside treatment, indicating that the restoration of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity is not dependent on normal concentrations of these compounds. In the same nerves, 32P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate increased 73-76 and 39-53%, respectively, in diabetic compared with nondiabetic tissue. Ganglioside administration abolished the elevated labeling of PPIs after 30 days but was ineffective after only 10 days. Neither ganglioside regimen was able to reverse enhanced phosphorylation of the major peripheral nerve myelin protein P0. The finding that gangliosides can more quickly correct the effects of diabetes on Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity than on PPI turnover suggests that the mechanisms underlying these two phenomena are not closely related and are distinct from the sequence of events responsible for altered myelin protein phosphorylation.\r"

  ".W": "Laminin, a basement membrane protein derived from the matrix of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine tumor, was nonenzymatically glycosylated in vitro in the presence of increasing glucose concentrations. The amount of glucose incorporated per laminin molecule was shown to be proportional to the molarity of glucose used. Nonenzymatic glycosylation resulted in formation of cross-links and alterations of the cruciform shape of laminin molecules; these alterations were dramatic when high concentrations of glucose were used. One of the functions of laminin, the process of self-assembly, was shown to be impaired after in vitro nonenzymatic glycosylation. Glucose incorporation resulted in a dramatic decrease of long-to-long laminin dimers, which normally form during the initial steps of assembly. Furthermore, nonenzymatic glycosylation of laminin reduced its ability to self-associate into complexes larger than dimers, as judged by turbidimetry. The observed decrease of maximal turbidity was proportional to the degree of nonenzymatic glycosylation. Aminoguanidine, which has been suggested to inhibit cross-link formation, was shown to restore to a large extent the shape of laminin, the percentage of long-to-long arm dimers, and the maximal turbidity when included in the mixtures of laminin and glucose. These data suggest that structural and functional alterations of laminin may be primarily due to formation of cross-links. Such modifications of laminin (along with our basement membrane components) may contribute to the morphological and physiological changes observed in basement membranes under diabetic conditions.\r"

Diabetes caused hyperglycemia (5-fold increase), hypoinsulinemia (85% decrease), and hyperglucagonemia (4-fold increase). There were also marked decreases in liver glycogen and activities of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes in liver. Although vanadate administration in control animals showed no significant effect on the various parameters measured except for a 70% decrease in plasma insulin, this treatment in diabetic rats restored these parameters to near control values. In diabetic rats, glycogen synthase a and the activity ratio (activity of glycogen synthase a divided by activity of total glycogen synthase) decreased to 30% of control levels and were restored to approximately 70-80% of control values after vanadate administration. A similar pattern was observed for the activity of synthase phosphatase. The activities of glycogenolytic enzymes, i.e., phosphorylase (activity of phosphorylase a and activity of total phosphorylase), phosphorylase kinase, and protein kinase (in presence or absence of cAMP), were significantly decreased by 40-70% in diabetic rats. These enzyme activities were recovered to 70-100% of control values after vanadate treatment. Phosphorylase phosphatase was not altered by diabetes, but the vanadate treatment of both groups, i.e., control and diabetic rats, showed a 25% increase in its activity (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, these results show insulinlike in vivo action of vanadate on various parameters related to hepatic glycogen metabolism.\r"

It was found that this epidermis possesses enzymes involved in both phase I (oxidation) and phase II (conjugation) reactions for drug biotransformation. The use of model substrates allowed the characterization of several isoenzymes. The homogenate fraction contained membrane-bound mixed-function oxydases (cytochrome P-450 dependent) involved in the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxy-, 7-pentoxy-, and 7-benzoxyresorufin, NADPH cytochrome c (P-450) reductase, testosterone 5 alpha-reductase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, which conjugate 1-naphthol and bilirubin. One isoform of each glutathione S-transferase, steroid-, and arylsulfatases, acting on estrone- and 4-methylumbelliferone sulfates, was detected. Additionally, the activity of two distinct forms of epoxide hydrolases, which hydrate cis- and trans-stilbene oxides, could be measured. The presence of these drug metabolizing enzymes in the reconstituted epidermis indicates that it has a potential to serve as a model to study epidermal drug metabolism in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Murine dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC) were recently reported to express T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma/delta chains. In a search for the human equivalent of these cells, we tested normal and lesional skin with MoAb which react with the TCR-gamma/delta heterodimer. We performed indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on epidermal sheets, and alkaline-phosphatase-anti-alkaline-phosphatase complex (APAAP) on epidermal cell smears. Frozen skin sections from normal skin and various cutaneous lymphocyte infiltrates were also studied. A few CD3+ T lymphocytes were consistently found in normal epidermis. Most of these cells appeared to be TCR-alpha/beta +, and some CD4+ or CD8+. On epidermal sheets and cell smears, only a very small TCR-gamma/delta + cell population was visualized (less than 0.1% of the total). On normal skin sections, we observed 0 to 3 gamma/delta + cells per section. When present, they were often located in the epidermal basal layer, and were round or dendritic. Double immunolabeling revealed that gamma/delta + cells differed from CD1+ Langerhans cells, and that they had a similar phenotypic pattern as gamma/delta + peripheral lymphocytes (PBL): CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, and CD8-. Immunostaining from various inflammatory skin lesions showed that the dermal infiltrates included CD3+ T lymphocytes but virtually no gamma/delta + cells. Only a few gamma/delta + cells were found in some end-evolutive infiltrates. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that normal human epidermis occasionally harbors TCR-gamma/delta complex bearing lymphocytes, which constitute a small fraction of the CD3+ cutaneous T lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90285487\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphocyte migration into the lymphoid organs and sites of inflammation is controlled by lymphocyte-endothelial cell interaction at sites where lymphocytes exit from the blood. Expression of Hermes-defined CD44 class of lymphocyte homing receptor and HECA-452 antigen specific for high-endothelium-mediating physiologic lymphocyte extravasation was studied in dermatitis herpetiformis, celiac disease, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, lymphocytosis cutis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis. Also, duodenal biopsies of patients suffering from dermatitis herpetiformis or celiac disease were studied for existence of these antigens. Infiltrating lymphocytes in the skin and in the duodenal area expressed homing receptor molecules when studied with monoclonal antibodies, Hermes-1 and Hermes-3, that recognize the CD44 class of molecules involved in lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules in peripheral lymph nodes, mucosa-associated lymphatic tissues, and inflamed synovium. However, the HECA-452 antigen was not detected on the venules, neither in the skin nor in the duodenum. Even the venules possessing high endothelium morphologically were HECA-452 negative. These findings suggest the CD44 class of lymphocyte homing receptor(s) is also involved in lymphocyte homing to inflamed skin and the duodenal area of the gut. However, on the basis of HECA-452 staining, high endothelial venules in inflamed skin and duodenum are not antigenically identical with high endothelial venules in organized lymphoid tissues. This finding indirectly supports the idea that molecules and/or mechanisms mediating lymphocyte extravasation might be distinct in these organs.\r"

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences were detected by amplification-mediated hybridization in 98% of the samples, 52% of which were positive for p24 antigen by ELISA. Neither TAS (93%) nor PCR (95%) detected HIV-1 sequences in all 86 samples. The hybridization-detection methods (slot blot, bead-based sandwich, and solution) used to detect the HIV-1-specific TAS products had a clear influence on the efficiency of detecting and quantitating the levels of HIV-1 present in these samples. The reproducibility of amplification of constant amounts of HIV-1 RNA and beta-globin DNA by TAS and PCR was studied over 3 months. The results indicated that variations of 10- and 5-fold in the HIV-1 sequence levels could be detected between samples by TAS and PCR, respectively. Within the range of sensitivities for each assay used, the administration of zidovudine did not appear to reduce the amount of HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences as observed in PBMC obtained serially from six AIDS patients.\r"

An in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelium was used to investigate interactions of PMNL and P. aeruginosa on epithelial cytotoxicity. A low inoculum of P. aeruginosa (10(7) bacteria) was minimally toxic to the epithelial cells (lysis = 9.0 +/- 2.9, detachment = 3.5 +/- 1.4). The addition of PMNL to the low inoculum markedly increased damage to the epithelial cells (lysis = 18.1 +/- 3.9, detachment = 17.6 +/- 3.6). Both the bacterium and a low-molecular-weight exoproduct were able to induce PMNL-mediated damage to epithelial cells. The damage was inhibited by serum or the addition of alpha 1 antiprotease but not by antioxidants. A larger inoculum of P. aeruginosa (10(9) bacteria) was directly toxic to the pulmonary cells (lysis = 44.8 +/- 4.1, detachment = 7.6 +/- 0.7). The damage was mediated by a heat-labile bacterial exoproduct. Pulmonary epithelial damage following pseudomonal infections may be related to either neutrophil or bacterial activity depending on the bacterial inoculum.\r"

Pyocyanin, but not 1-hp, increased the generation of superoxide and the rate and duration of oxygen uptake by activated neutrophils. Both agents increased the myeloperoxidase-mediated iodinating activity of neutrophils, which in the case of 1-hp was due to stimulation of the release of myeloperoxidase by activated neutrophils. 1-hp also increased the release of lysozyme by activated neutrophils. Pyocyanin caused only slight enhancement of the release of myeloperoxidase and lysozyme by stimulated neutrophils but was more potent with respect to the release of the specific granule marker, vitamin B12-binding protein. These data indicate the existence of diverse, proinflammatory interactions of pyocyanin and 1-hp with human phagocytes, which may intensify neutrophil-mediated tissue damage during P. aeruginosa infections.\r"

Susceptible strains of tubercle bacilli convert PZA to pyrazinoic acid (POA) through pyrazinamidase (PZase), which resistant strains and Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin lack. PZA susceptibility results obtained in cultured human macrophages were compared with those in the broth BACTEC system with 7H12 medium at pH 6.0 for strains known to be PZase-positive or -negative. Although added POA was unable to inhibit tubercle bacilli in cultured macrophages, it was able to inhibit them at very high concentrations in the BACTEC broth. Intracellularly formed POA would not be able to escape from the macrophage, and therefore would accumulate sufficiently to lower pH to toxic levels for tubercle bacilli. The results suggest that the cultured macrophages contribute actively or passively to the effectiveness of PZA, such as through the proposed mechanism of low pH generated by PZase in the phagolysosomes.\r"

Pretreatment dissociated immune complexes and denatured antibodies with little or no compromise of p24 antigen immunoreactivity. For 652 HIV antibody-positive sera, direct comparison of the pretreatment with the conventional assay demonstrated substantial increase in both antigen positivity (50.6% vs. 12.4%) and in the level of p24 antigen in sera. Serum HIV antigen is mainly in the form of immune complexes in most individuals at all stages of HIV infection. Longitudinal study of 1 year (three measurements) on 29 seroconverters demonstrated two main patterns of p24 antigen expression in sera: 34.5% of infected individuals never express any form of detectable HIV antigen and 58.6% persistently demonstrate serum p24 antigen, usually in complex with antibody. Only 6.9% show episodic p24 antigen positivity.\r"

Also, IL-1 induces its own gene expression and synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In this study, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production by PBMC of 40 individuals stimulated with IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta was determined by specific radioimmunoassay (RIA). After 3 h of PBMC incubation with IL-1, TNF-alpha mRNA was detected. IL-1 alpha stimulated both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, but there was no correlation in the amount of TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta synthesized in the PBMC of 29 individuals. IL-1-stimulated adherent cells produced approximately 50% more TNF-alpha than did unfractionated PBMC. Coincubation with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not change the amount of IL-1-induced TNF-alpha, whereas in the same culture IFN-gamma inhibited (greater than 70%) IL-1-induced IL-1 production. Endogenous pyrogen and TNF-like activity were detected in the sera of rabbits 3.5 h after injection of either IL-1 alpha or -1 beta. These studies demonstrate that IL-1 induced TNF-alpha production in vivo and in vitro.\r"

The effect of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF and M-CSF) on intramacrophage survival of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis (Lma) were compared with those of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Macrophages previously infected with Lma were treated with or without GM-CSF and M-CSF. Compared with no cytokine treatment, treatment with GM-CSF (0.1-100 ng/ml) or M-CSF (1:3.5 X 10(6) - 1:3.5 X 10(3) dilutions) caused a significant dose-dependent reduction in intracellular parasites, 427 +/- 20 (mean +/- SE) Lma/100 macrophages. GM-CSF or M-CSF in combination with IFN-gamma resulted in more effective inhibition of intracellular parasites. Thus, the cytostatic activity appears to require interaction between cytokines, macrophages, and amastigotes. These cytokines are potential therapeutic agents for visceral leishmaniasis.\r"

E. faecalis was recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; mortality was noted in 8 (13%) of 62 mice after 14 days of E. faecalis intestinal overgrowth. Light, immunofluorescent, and electron (scanning and transmission) microscopy of ileal tissue was used in an attempt to localize E. faecalis translocating across intestinal tissue. Dense coccal bacteria were observed in the intestinal lumen, and the epithelium appeared intact. Coccal bacteria were observed adherent to the microvillus border of the entire villous epithelium, including the deeper regions of the intestinal crypts. Immunofluorescence localized E. faecalis within columnar epithelial cells, lamina propria, submucosa, and muscularis externa (including the lumen of small vessels). Transmission electron microscopy localized coccal bacteria within vacuoles in the cytoplasm of intact epithelial cells. These results indicated that E. faecalis could translocate across an intact intestinal tract and cause systemic infection and death. In this model, the intestinal epithelial cell appeared to be a portal of entry in the pathogenesis of systemic E. faecalis infection.\r"

Using data from the literature, we estimated rates of gastrointestinal tract bleeding in NSAID users, direct medical costs, years of life lost, and cost-effectiveness of a 1-year course of misoprostol in three clinical populations of NSAID users: all users, users aged 60 years or older, and users with rheumatoid arthritis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for misoprostol as primary prevention were $667,400 per year of life saved for all NSAID users; $186,700 per year of life saved for users aged 60 years or older; and $95,600 per year of life saved for users with rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol as secondary prevention for those who continued to take NSAIDs despite having had an episode of gastrointestinal tract bleeding in the previous year was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than $40,000 per year of life saved in all patient groups. We conclude that misoprostol is costly as primary prevention for NSAID-induced gastrointestinal tract bleeding in the groups examined but may be cost-effective as secondary prevention in patients with a proved history of gastrointestinal tract bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The experimental immunosuppressive drug FK 506 was given to 36 renal transplant recipients, many of whom were highly sensitized. Ten were undergoing kidney retransplantation, 10 also underwent liver transplantation at an earlier time (6 patients) or concomitantly (4 patients), and 2 patients received a third organ (heart or pancreas) in addition to a liver and kidney. With follow-ups of 4 to 13 months, all but 2 of the 36 patients are alive, 29 (81%) are dialysis free, and most have good renal function. Twenty of the 29 dialysis-free patients are receiving no or low-dose (2.5 to 5.0 mg/d) prednisone therapy. Only one kidney was lost to cellular rejection. However, patients who had antidonor cytotoxic antibodies in current or historical serum samples had a high rate (3 of 9) of irreversible humoral rejection. A low incidence of posttransplant hypertension was noteworthy. Hirsutism and gingival hyperplasia were not observed. Serum cholesterol levels in patients who took FK 506 were unexpectedly low, and the effect on the level of uric acid was minimal. The side effects of FK 506 therapy include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and potential induction of a diabetic state. These are similar to the side effects of cyclosporine use, but probably less severe. The seeming safety, efficacy, and relative freedom from side effects of FK 506 encourage further trials in kidney transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Viruses are the most mutable and rapidly evolving human parasites. Therefore, it is not surprising that new virus diseases, such as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, are emerging. However, these new viruses are relatively few in number, which reflects the constraints placed on viral evolution by the requirement for maintenance of virus structure and function and virus adaptation to restricted ecologic sites. Most \"new\" viral diseases, such as the hemorrhagic fevers, result from environmental disruptions that increase human contact with animals or insect vectors of old viruses. However, truly novel viruses with lethal potential or capacity for global spread have emerged in animals as a consequence of single-point mutations or genetic recombination between viruses. Given the mutability of viruses and the inevitability of environmental change, we must be prepared for the evolution of new virus diseases.\r"

Cytosolic contents of all three steroid receptors, however, were higher in the PCA group. The level of nuclear steroid receptors, although present in fewer cases in both groups, was higher than the cytoplasmic receptors. The serum profile of estradiol, cortisol, and prolactin was normal in both groups, whereas LH, FSH, and progesterone levels were higher than in normal adults. Serum testosterone level was within normal range in the BPH group, but it was significantly below normal (P less than 0.005) in PCA patients.\r"

For motor development index in trial A, this advantage was 15 points; in infants born small for gestation, it was 23 points (nearly 1.5 SD). Moderate developmental impairment (developmental index less than 85), notably motor impairment, was considerably more common in the group fed term formula. Infants fed preterm formula also had a small benefit in social maturity quotient. Thus, a short period of early dietary manipulation in preterm infants had major consequences for later development, which suggests that the first weeks may be critical for nutrition.\r"

The prevalence of valvular lesions in patients with SLE was 22.7% compared with 2.9% in a control group of 68 healthy volunteers. 50 SLE patients had antibodies against phospholipids. The prevalence of valve vegetations (8/50 [16%]) and of mitral regurgitation (19/50 [38%]) was significantly higher among the SLE patients with antiphospholipids than among those without (1 and 10/82 [1.2% and 12%], respectively). During follow-up of the patients with valvular lesions, haemodynamically significant clinical valve disease developed in 6 but surgery was required in only 1; 9 had cerebrovascular occlusions; and 7 died, although no death was due directly to the cardiac involvement. Thus, valvular heart disease, particularly affecting the mitral valve, is common in patients with SLE, and the presence of antibodies against phospholipids is associated with a higher prevalence of valvular abnormalities in these patients.\r"

ACA bound to these liposomes only in the presence of plasma or serum, which indicated a requirement for a plasma component. This component--referred to as aca-cofactor--was purified; its activity to support ACA binding to liposomes that contained cardiolipin was not destroyed by heat (10 min at 90 degrees C), but was greatly diminished on incubation with trypsin. aca-cofactor bound liposomes that contained negatively charged phospholipid but had no affinity for liposomes that contained neutral phospholipid (eg, phosphatidylcholine); this binding was independent of calcium ions. aca-cofactor was essential for ACA to bind to liposomes that contained cardiolipin or phosphatidylserine and, when coated on a microtitre plate in the absence of any phospholipid, aca-cofactor was an apparent antigen for ACA in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aca-cofactor is a single chain polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 50 kD (non-reduced), which increases to 70 kD upon reduction, and its properties closely resemble those of beta 2-glycoprotein I (apolipoprotein H).\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies of patients with mitochondrial myopathies suggest the existence of both muscle-specific and developmentally regulated isoforms of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme complex of the electron transport chain. To investigate the temporal pattern of gene expression of nuclear genes for COX in developing muscle, the steady-state levels of COX mRNA in total RNA from a satellite cell-derived mouse muscle cell line, C2C12, were analyzed and compared with COX mRNA levels in mature rat skeletal muscle. Undifferentiated myoblasts, myotubes just after fusion (early myotubes), and fully differentiated, contractile, striated myotubes (late myotubes) were analyzed for mRNA levels for four of the 10 different nuclear-encoded COX subunits: IV, Vb, Vlc and VIII-liver. Of these, IV, Vb and Vlc are identical in both bovine heart and liver, whereas subunit VIII has heart and liver isoforms. In C2C12 myoblasts, the level of mRNA for subunits IV, Vb, and VIII-liver is equal to or greater than the level in tissues such as brain, skeletal muscle, and liver. As myoblasts fuse and differentiate into myotubes, the levels of mRNA for these subunits undergo radically different changes. Transcripts for subunits IV and Vb accumulate to higher levels during myogenesis. The level of subunit VIII transcripts decreases during myogenesis, providing additional evidence that subunit VIII has tissue-specific isoforms in the rat. Little mRNA for COX Vlc was detected in either the C2C12 cell line or in primary embryonic rat myoblasts or myotubes in culture in spite of high levels in adult skeletal muscles, suggesting that subunit Vlc may have both fetal and adult isoforms in rodents.\r"

In CSF samples from 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 12 controls, we then quantitated this approximately 25 kDa form as well as the approximately 125 and approximately 105 kDa derivatives that we previously identified. Our analysis shows (1) that, in AD, there is a significant decrease in the relative amount of the approximately 105 kDa form and a corresponding significant increase in the relative amount of the approximately 25 kDa form; (2) that these changes correlate with the mental status of the AD patients; and (3) that the same changes occur to a lesser extent in elderly as compared with young control patients. These observations indicate that processing of the beta APP changes in normal individuals as they age and to a greater extent in those who develop AD. The changes in beta APP derivatives that we have observed in CSF could have major implications because they may reflect fundamental mechanisms responsible for amyloid deposition and can be measured in living patients.\r"

We found that the plasma concentration of ANF was significantly lower in patients with autonomic failure than in controls. Patients with autonomic failure had a significantly higher urinary sodium excretion during the night (8 PM to 8 AM) than during the day (8 AM to 8 PM), and the plasma concentration of ANF significantly decreased during the night in these patients, indicating that high circulating levels of ANF were not the cause of the nocturnal natriuresis. Furthermore, circulating levels of ANF responded appropriately to reductions in right atrial pressure induced by head-up tilt and extracellular fluid volume changes induced by mineralocorticoid administration. These results indicate that exaggerated circulating levels of ANF are not responsible for the orthostatic hypotension or nocturnal natriuresis in patients with autonomic failure, and that appropriate regulation of ANF occurs in patients with autonomic failure.\r"

At present, MSAFP has become the dominant serum marker, but much work needs to be done to refine its usefulness as a screen and its utility in association with other measurements of fetoplacental well-being. The trend in modern obstetric management is toward an array of biophysical tests of fetal well-being, particularly in the last trimester of pregnancy. Biochemical screening in early gestation is used increasingly to assess future fetoplacental status and to predict risk for later pregnancy complications. Combinations of these biochemical and biophysical modalities will likely achieve the greatest predictive success in assessing fetal and placental well-being.\r"

The tongue tumors and metastatic tumors to the submandibular lymph nodes were transplanted to the buccal pouch of recipient hamsters. In the first generation, lymph node metastases were found only in hamsters that received a metastatic tumor. The metastatic tumors to the lymph nodes were maintained by serial transplantation into the buccal pouch from metastatic sites until the eleventh generation. The incidence of lymph node metastasis exceeded 90% in animals after the ninth generation.\r"

Facial paresis as a presenting symptom of glomus tumors is well known, as is facial nerve invasion by glomus tumors. However, a primary fallopian canal glomus tumor that extends extratemporally to the pes anserinus is unusual. Although facial nerve grafting may be necessary for removal of some glomus jugulare tumors, the need for facial nerve grafting appears to be uniform in the patients with primary fallopian canal glomus tumors. The primary fallopian canal glomus tumors that we report did not involve the jugular fossa or the Jacobson's branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Both tumors did extend to the middle ear and mastoid and followed the facial nerve extratemporally. The latter features appear to typify primary fallopian canal glomus tumors.\r"

This approach offered a systematic resection of cancers in this region and was designated \"stylohamular dissection\" because the medial boundary of the bloc is surgical plane between the styloid process and the hamulus of the pterygoid. All structures lateral to this plane are removed, sparing the internal carotid artery. Since 1977, twenty infratemporal fossa and lateral skull base dissections have been performed for palliation of metastatic or recurrent disease in the infratemporal fossa. Most patients obtained palliation of trismus, facial pain, or relief from an unmanageable ulcerating lesion. This technique offers improved average disease-free intervals, as well as enhanced survival rates compared to non-en bloc resections. A summary of the case presentations, survival statistics, and surgical technique with detailed cadaver dissections are presented.\r"

The average respondent performed 4.6 fistula explorations among 197 otologic surgeries (some of these were myringotomies) per year. The following statements represent areas of general agreement. The single most important feature of the history is previous trauma or barotrauma. At present no test can replace clinical judgment; however, despite sound judgment and sophisticated testing, it is very difficult to document the presence or absence of a fistula preoperatively. Most often the diagnosis is based on the total clinical picture: history, physical examination, and laboratory testing.\r"

  ".W": "During 1983-87, tympanostomy tubes were inserted in a total of 4952 ears of 2575 children remitted to the ENT Department of our hospital because of chronic or recurrent otitis media problems. The children were included in a prospective study and referred to one of three groups for comparison of findings. Group 1 included all 6- to 12-month-old infants undergoing primary tube treatment; group 2, all children 1 year or older who had their first ventilation tube(s) inserted in connection with adenoidectomy; and group 3, all children in whom tympanostomy had been performed one or more times previously. Middle ear effusion was aspirated from 2392 ears (48%); 67.6% of all ears were negative for bacteria and 22.1% of the ears with effusion grew pathogenic bacteria. S. pneumoniae was the most frequently cultured pathogen among the 6 to 12 month olds in group 1, but in groups 2 and 3 H. influenzae occurred more frequently than S. pneumoniae. Beta-lactamase-producing strains of pathogenic bacteria were formed in only 4% of all ears with effusion: H. influenzae in 1.2% and B. catarrhalis in 2.8%. Compared with figures from the United states, the frequency of beta-lactamase-producing strains is low in the present series. This is probably explained by differences in antimicrobial treatment practices; in Finland and the Scandinavian countries, penicillin V is the primary drug for acute otitis media. In light of present results, it seems well-suited for treatment of otitis media in young children.\r"

Five patients were seen between 3 to 10 years after surgery with a return of speech symptoms and persistent unilateral vocal fold paralysis. Before injection, comparisons with controls on spectrographic measures of pitch and voice breaks, aperiodicity, and sentence length demonstrated significant symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia (p less than or equal to 0.02). Electromyographic measures demonstrated equal levels of thyroarytenoid muscle activation on the operated and non-operated sides with bipolar needle electrodes, and heightened activity in both muscles relative to normal. Therefore, symptom return was associated with thyroarytenoid innervation after recurrent nerve surgery. In all patients, the thyroarytenoid muscle on the side operated on was injected with type A botulinum toxin. In two patients, toxin was also injected on the side not operated on. Significant (p less than or equal to 0.002) reductions in all speech symptoms occurred after injection. Electromyographic measures demonstrated significant reductions in the percent activation levels of both the injected muscle and noninjected muscles (p less than or equal to 0.01). Botulinum toxin injections were an effective treatment of post-surgical symptom recurrence in adductor spasmodic dysphonia.\r"

Clinical ECoG was used to study guinea pigs (n = 35) both before and after surgical fistulization (n = 18) or fistulization and repair (n = 17) of the round window membrane. The animals were killed, and histopathologic examination of the temporal bones was carried out 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days after surgery. Of the 33 animals that survived surgery, 30 demonstrated ECoG wave-forms. No significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative wave-forms could be detected. Histopathologic study showed rapid healing of the fistulae, with no evidence of hydrops. Although there appeared to be a relatively selective loss of the outer hair cells of the cochlear basal turn, autolysis precluded detailed analysis. ECoG, as performed clinically, does not appear to detect the presence, spontaneous healing, or repair of a round window membrane fistula in the guinea pig.\r"

A retrospective review of 168 cases of TAA was performed in order to: (1) define the natural history of associated recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) and (2) propose mechanisms for the development of RLNP in operated and nonoperated aneurysms. Of 168 aneurysms, 5% manifested hoarseness secondary to RLNP. All had type I aneurysms. Only one patient regained vocal cord function after surgical treatment of the aneurysm. RLNP developed as a sequela of TAA repair in 12% of the patients managed surgically. RLNP associated with TAA type III repair had a higher incidence of recovery than paralysis that occurred after TAA type I repair (40% vs. 0% recovery). Sixty-six percent of all patients with permanently paralyzed larynges in this series attained glottic competence sufficient to avoid Teflon injection, and 27% of all RLNP associated with TAA in this series required Teflon injection for aspiration, severe dysphonia, or both. Seventeen percent of the patients with vocal cord paralysis associated with TAA recovered within 12 months. Aneurysm classification and pertinent anatomic relationships are discussed with reference to various mechanisms of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.\r"

  ".W": "Dacryocystorhinostomy is usually the standard approach to treat epiphora caused by lower lacrimal tract obstruction. When the pathologic condition lies in the upper lacrimal passage, however, alternate bypass or reconstructive options must be considered. Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy, using the Jones tube, can effectively bypass the upper tract, but the technique may be complicated by granulation tissue formation, infection from unapposed mucosal flaps, and inefficient passage of tears through scar as a result of healing by secondary intention. Canaliculodacryocystorhinostomy affords the advantages of a physiologic reconstruction, but is limited by availability of sufficient canaliculus, requires a lengthy and tedious dissection, and must be performed using a microsurgical approach. We describe an alternate technique of conjunctivorhinostomy that provides total lacrimal bypass and has the advantages of bipedicled mucosal flap apposition, temporary stenting, and symptomatic improvement of epiphora. Several case examples illustrate the indications, advantages, and disadvantages of this technique.\r"

  ".W": "Recent changes in reimbursement for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy have resulted in a large number of these procedures being done on an outpatient basis. There is still considerable controversy, however, as to the safety of this concept. We reviewed the charts of 1000 consecutive patients who underwent these procedures. Three hundred ninety-six procedures were performed as inpatient surgery and 604 were performed as outpatient surgery. Patients were considered as candidates for outpatient surgery if they met specific criteria, such as good overall medical health, no central apnea, normal bleeding history and profile, and had adequate social considerations. The inpatient group included those patients who did not meet the criteria to be outpatients. We compared the complication rates of these two groups with regard to age, type of procedure performed (tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, adenotonsillectomy), and indication for surgery in order to determine if there was any increased risk of outpatient surgery, despite strict selection criteria. The two groups were similar in their distribution with regards to age, sex, type of procedure, and indication for surgery. The overall complication rate for the entire group was 7.9%, with an 11.8% complication rate for inpatients and 4.1% complications for outpatients. The higher complication rate among the inpatient group is probably a direct result of the selection process because this group included the higher-risk patients. On the basis of these findings, we believe that surgery of the tonsils and adenoids can be performed safely as an outpatient procedure, regardless of age, indication, or procedure, if the candidates for ambulatory surgery are carefully selected by the surgeon.\r"

These include the middle fossa approach, the posterior fossa approach, the retrolabyrinthine approach, and the retrosigmoid approach. Each has its own unique benefits, as well as disadvantages. A new posterior-inferior approach to the internal auditory canal (the infralabyrinthine approach) has been developed. This approach affords exposure of at least the medial half of the internal auditory canal while remaining extradural and extralabyrinthine. By dissecting below the posterior semicircular canal, and remaining extradural, hearing is preserved. The dissection can proceed far enough laterally in the internal auditory canal to separate the cochlear and vestibular nerve divisions. Further anatomic considerations, as well as clinical applicability, will be discussed.\r"

Survival rates for autografts of fat have been quoted anywhere from 30% to 80%. Our study uses a reproducible rabbit animal model for autotransplantation of adipose tissue and examines the histopathologic changes that occur to the graft over time. Autogenous subcutaneous fat was removed from a dorsal scapular donor site, treated to stimulate cannula damage as in liposuction, then reinjected at the base of the ear. Histologic examination of the grafts were made at 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 100 days after transplantation. Hematoxylin-eosin sections were graded on degree of fibrosis present (0 to 4+), viable fat (1 to 10), degree of inflammation (0 to 4+), and neovascularization (+ or -). Viability of fat decreased from 8.5 to 10 at 5 days to 2 viability at 40 days. Acute inflammation peaked at 10 days, followed by the chronic inflammatory response with macrophages and multinucleated giant cells scavenging the dying fat graft. Neovascularization began at 5 days, peaked at 10 days, and remained constant thereafter only at the edge of the graft. Microcysts appeared at 15 days and increased in number in proportion to the decrease in viable fat. In summary, the temporal histologic events are progressive fibrosis; decreased amount of viable fat; inflammation beginning with a neutrophilic response, later a macrophage and giant cell response; and neovascularization at the periphery of the graft insufficient to maintain graft viability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects were seen as part of routine health screening before attending recreational summer camp. The photographic appearance of each tympanic membrane was judged on two separate occasions by an otolaryngologist who categorized them as \"normal\", \"abnormal\", or \"cannot determine\". The repeatability of the categorizations was fair: kappa = 0.44. Only the tympanic membranes categorized identically twice were used for data analysis. The left-right symmetry of the tympanic membrane categorizations was fair: correlation coefficient phi = 0.42. Subjects categorized as having bilaterally normal tympanic membranes were considered to have not had previous otitis media (N = 95). In contrast, subjects categorized as having at least one abnormal tympanic membrane were considered to have had previous otitis media (N = 13). Head length and width, measured by calipers, and the cephalic index (width divided by length) x 100 were determined for each person. On the average, the cephalic index of the normal subjects was lower than that for the subjects with otitis media (t = 3.06, p less than 0.005). These data support the suggestions of Pautow (1925) and Worley et al. (1987): dolichocephalic persons have otitis media less often than do brachycephalic persons. Though this association is not useful in clinical care of the individual patient, it may be considered a weak external manifestation of the different cranial base and eustachian tube anatomy found in persons with otitis media.\r"

We reviewed our experience with 100 consecutive patients operated on for head and neck cancer. All patients had 5-year followup. The complete report covers site and stage. In summary, for all cancers of the larynx (N = 60), the recurrence rate was 45% for those in whom a wound infection developed and 26% for those in whom no such infection developed. For cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (N = 40), the recurrence rate was 80% for those in whom wound infections developed and 51% for those who had no infections. Because of the small number of patients in whom recurrence developed, with or without infection, the relationship does not reach statistical significance. For head and neck cancer, unlike abdominal cancer, the development of a postoperative wound infection may have an adverse effect on survival rather than a salutory effect.\r"

  ".W": "There is a substantial need for improvement of the hearing situation for patients, with chronic middle ear or ear canal disorders. To improve hearing for these patients, two different bone conduction hearing systems have been developed. The Nobelpharma Auditory System HC 200-the bone-anchored hearing aid we present here-uses a percutaneous transducer; whereas the Audiant device, developed by Dr. Jack Hough, uses a transcutaneous transducer. In percutaneous transmission, the transducer is directly coupled to the bone by means of a permanent skin penetration, whereas in transcutaneous transmission one part of the transducer is implanted and the other part is kept outside the intact skin and soft tissue. Comprehensive audiologic assessments indicate great differences in performance between the two systems. These differences probably originate in differences in length of gap and in different suspension properties of the two transducer systems. This article will demonstrate that large gaps, such as in the transcutaneous transducer, can be devastating for power consumption, maximum output capability, and second harmonic distortion. Since the properties of the suspension in the transcutaneous transducer are not under adequate control and the complication risk of permanent skin penetration is low, we continue to concentrate our efforts on percutaneous transducer systems.\r"

Of 244 patients with primary cancer of the supraglottis who were treated surgically, 22 (9%) had no neck treatment, 188 (77%) had unilateral neck dissection, and 34 (14%) had bilateral simultaneous neck dissection. Dissection on one or both sides of the neck was required later in 6 (27%) of the 22 patients with no neck treatment and in 32 (17%) of the 188 patients who had unilateral dissection. There were no differences among the treatment groups in the incidence of death from any cause or in the incidence of death from cancer, although neck stage did differ from group to group. The influence of delayed metastasis on survival was analyzed to explain these findings. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that death occurred at a rate 1.81 times higher in a person with a positive neck stage than in a person of the same age who had a negative stage. Also, death occurred at a rate 1.5 times higher for a person 10 years older than for a person with the same stage of disease. The influence of stage on the probability of need for a second dissection indicated that a patient with a positive neck stage had a 6.3 times greater likelihood of requiring a subsequent neck dissection than a person with a negative neck stage.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer of the nasal skin is usually well-circumscribed, superficial, and has an excellent prognosis. However, a small number of aggressive lesions require a partial or total rhinectomy. We retrospectively reviewed patients seen at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 1980, for nasal cancer. There were 147 patients identified as requiring full-thickness nasal resections, of whom 68 (46.3%) required a hemi- or complete rhinectomy. Lesions requiring extensive rhinectomy usually involved the ala or were recurrent multicentric, squamous cell carcinomas greater than 4 cm. These patients had significantly poorer prognoses than the group in general. Recurrence developed in 45 patients (30.6%), and two thirds of all recurrences were seen within 2 years. In this series, the histology of the malignancy and its size, in the case of large basal cell carcinomas, were both predictive of a poor prognosis. Only the primary site was significant in predicting recurrence, whereas tumor size and histology were significant predictors of the need for an extensive rhinectomy. Delayed reconstruction is recommended in patients who are in poor health and have large recurrent lesions that are multicentric or involve the ala or dorsum. The timing of reconstruction is individualized, but a 2-year wait after surgery is recommended. Prosthetic rehabilitation is a good interim measure.\r"

These same nasal endoscopes play an important role in the office diagnosis of nasal and sinus disorders. While not all physicians or medical institutions can afford the cost of nasal endoscopes for nasal sinus surgery, the cost of an office examination set is reasonable and the patient benefits are great. One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with nasal and/or sinus complaints and normal anterior rhinoscopic nasal speculum and posterior rhinoscopic nasopharyngeal examinations were each examined with rigid fiberoptic nasal endoscopy by two physicians to confirm each findings. Nasal endoscopy revealed fifty-eight (38.7%) patients with nasal pathology who had not been seen with traditional anterior and posterior rhinoscopic examination. The pathology found included obstructed natural maxillary sinus ostia and several pathologic disorders in the middle meatus, such as polyps and \"synechiae\". Many of these patients had seen several physicians and exhibited frustrating longstanding symptoms, some of which included postnasal catarrh, postnasal drainage, headache, facial pain, \"sinus\", pressure, and congestion. Nasal endoscopy can find nasal and sinus pathology that might easily be missed with routine speculum and nasopharyngeal examination. For patients with unexplained nasal sinus symptoms, the general otolaryngologist might consider rigid nasal endoscopic office examination as part of the routine office examination.\r"

In 1985 we introduced the retrosigmoid-IAC vestibular neurectomy, which allows a more complete transection of the vestibular nerves within the internal auditory canal (IAC). Vertigo control has been excellent; however, in 75% of patients, postoperative headaches have been a significant problem. In 1987, the best aspects of the two procedures were incorporated and the combined retrolab-retrosigmoid vestibular neurectomy was developed. The procedure is similar to the RVN in that all bone covering the lateral venous sinus is removed. It differs from the RVN in that a limited mastoidectomy is performed and the dura is opened just behind the LVS. The LVS is retracted forward, exposing the cerebellopontine angle. This allows the surgeon the option to section the vestibular nerve in either the CP angle or the IAC, depending upon the presence or absence of a cochieovestibular cleavage plane in the CP angle. The results have been good and the incidence of headache has been reduced to 10%. The technique, results, and complications are reported here.\r"

In this study, earlier treatment times frequently produced microtia similar to that seen in affected infants, as well as recognizable patterns of temporal bone and ossicular abnormalities; exposure at a later developmental stage resulted in facial tags with less severely affected ears. Possible teratogenic mechanisms of isotretinoin are discussed.

Complete activation requires two signaling events, one through the antigen-specific receptor and one through the receptor for a costimulatory molecule. In the absence of the latter signal, the T cell makes only a partial response and, more importantly, enters an unresponsive state known as clonal anergy in which the T cell is incapable of producing its own growth hormone, interleukin-2, on restimulation. Our current understanding at the molecular level of this modulatory process and its relevance to T cell tolerance are reviewed.\r"

Thirty-two patients who had resection have been followed up for 6 months to 4 years, and 29 (90%) have had good results. Our findings suggest that epidural recordings are valuable in patients with epilepsy who are being considered for surgical resection.

Endobronchial tuberculosis usually follows 2 to 3 months of antituberculous therapy. This case is especially unusual because the endobronchial disease developed before diagnosis or therapy. Endobronchial tuberculosis should be considered in any patient with symptoms or roentgenographic findings of obstructive airway disease.

All the patients had all night sleep studies performed and maximum inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures (PI and Pemax), lung volumes, single breath transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO), and daytime arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide tensions (PaCO2) determined. Vital capacity in the erect and supine posture was measured in 14 patients. Mean (SD) PI max at RV was low at 33 (19) cm H2O (32% predicted). Mean PE max at TLC was also low at 53 (24) cm H2O (28% predicted). Mean daytime PaO2 was 67 (16) mm Hg and PaCO2 52 (13) mm Hg (8.9 (2.1) and 6.9 (1.7) kPa). The mean lowest arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 83% (12%) during non-REM and 60% (23%) during REM sleep. Detailed electromyographic evidence in one patient with poliomyelitis showed that SaO2% during non-REM sleep was maintained by accessory respiratory muscle activity. There was a direct relation between the lowest SaO2 value during REM sleep and vital capacity, daytime PaO2, PaCO2, and percentage fall in vital capacity from the erect to the supine position (an index of diaphragm weakness). The simple measurement of vital capacity in the erect and supine positions and arterial blood gas tensions when the patient is awake provide a useful initial guide to the degree of respiratory failure occurring during sleep in patients with neuromuscular disorders. A sleep study is required to assess the extent of sleep induced respiratory failure accurately.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of exercise on gas exchange was studied in 17 patients (seven male and 10 female) recovering in hospital from acute severe asthma. On admission the patients (mean age 26 (SD 8) years) had a mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) of 26.8% (5.7%) predicted, a mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 8.63 (1.26) kPa, and a mean alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2) of 5.98 (1.34) kPa. Once resting symptoms had resolved (after 3.7 (1.6) days) patients performed a constant load exercise test (100 watts for men, 75 watts for women) on a bicycle ergometer for five minutes. PEF was measured before exercise and at five minute intervals for 30 minutes after exercise. Blood gas tensions were measured on capillary blood before, during, and 10 minutes after exercise. Treatment was not interrupted for this study. Mean PEF at rest was 87.6% (21.1%) predicted and showed no significant change after exercise. Mean PaO2 was 13.13 (1.37) kPa before exercise; it showed no significant change during exercise (13.93 (1.34) kPa) or 10 minutes after exercise (13.50 (2.15) kPa). Mean A-aDO2 also showed no change, being 1.82 (1.31) kPa before exercise, 1.79 (1.27) kPa during exercise, and 2.53 (0.93) kPa after exercise. It is concluded that moderate exercise carried out shortly after treatment for acute severe asthma is unlikely to result in worsening gas exchange during or after exercise if resting PEF, PaO2 and A-aDO2 have attained normal or near normal values.\r"

A study was designed to find out whether products of bacteria commonly isolated in chronic bronchial infection stimulate neutrophil migration in vitro. Neutrophils from healthy donors were studied by a modified Boyden chamber technique. Bacterial culture filtrates stimulated neutrophil migration over a wide dilution range and the chemotactic activity was heat stable. Culture filtrates derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were significantly chemokinetic and directionally chemotactic, whereas filtrates from Staphylococcus aureus were only chemotactic. Gel filtration of S aureus and P aeruginosa culture filtrates yielded high, medium, and low molecular weight fractions showing chemotactic activity. S pneumoniae and H influenzae yielded fractions with only low molecular weight chemotactic activity. Neutrophil chemotactic responses, occurring in response to all bacterial species tested, appear to represent a defence mechanism by the host. Chemoattractant activity may, however, contribute to bronchial damage mediated by products released from continuously attracted, activated neutrophils.\r"

The clinical, immunologic, and serologic status of the children was assessed prospectively. Fourteen subjects were symptomatic: 3 had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 5 had signs and symptoms that were compatible with HIV-1 infection (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga, class P2A), and 6 had ill-defined symptoms that could not be definitely attributed to HIV. Our data indicated that the maximum rate of vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection in New Haven, Conn, was less than 30%, and the rate of HIV-1-associated disease occurring during the first 3 years of life was 16%. The mean and median time to loss of maternal antibody, as detected by Western blot in seroreverters, was approximately 7 months, and the half-life of passive antibody was 38 days. A continued close follow-up of children in the cohort studied, and others like it, is critical to learn the full range of outcomes of HIV infection in the pediatric population.\r"

  ".U": "90289805\r", 
  ".W": "Unlike many other systemically administered pneumotoxicants affecting alveolar septa, Monocrotaline (MCT) does not cause a proliferative type II cell response. To determine whether MCT has an effect that might alter the type II cell response, we determined the numerical density and volume of type II cells in lungs from MCT-treated rats. Morphometric parameters were derived from estimates of nuclear volume based on point and intercept ratios counted in electron micrographs of type II cell profiles. These were combined with point and intercept counts of alveolar septal structures and counts of nuclear profiles per unit area to calculate average cell volume and numerical density of type II cells. Areal densities of type II cell profiles were determined by light microscopic counts of alveolar parenchyma and normalized to the volume of lung parenchyma. Cell volume of type II cells was markedly increased in MCT-treated animals (1.25 X 10(3) microns3) compared with controls (3.4 X 102) microns3). Nuclear diameter of type II cells was similarly increased (8.53 microns in treated animals versus 5.81 microns in controls). The number of type II cells was markedly decreased in treated animals (1.36 X 10(6] cells per cm3 lung parenchyma compared with 7.65 X 10(6) cells per cm3 parenchyma in controls). We conclude that MCT causes marked cellular hypertrophy of type II alveolar epithelial cells and that this hypertrophy is somehow related to a failure to maintain normal cell populations in the lung of MCT-treated rats. We hypothesize that this change is analogous to the hypertrophy and mitotic inhibition that occurs in the liver of animals treated with hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.\r"

As reported earlier, smooth muscle cells grown from the newborn or injured vessels have a distinctive epithelioid appearance. The platelet factor independent smooth muscle cells have a similar appearance. Unlike the cells from newborn animals or from injured vessels, smooth muscle cells derived in this way from the adult animal do not produce PDGF, although they do display PDGF receptors. Studies in serum-free medium show that the PDGF-independent cells can respond to PDGF when all other components of serum are absent; however, growth of these smooth muscle cells proceeds equally well in low concentrations of serum, independent of the presence of PDGF or other growth factors detectable by growth-promoting assays using either 3T3 cells or smooth muscle cells whose growth is dependent on factors present in whole blood serum. Taken together with recent observations in vivo, these data suggest that growth of at least some smooth muscle cells may depend on mechanisms independent of release of growth factors by platelets.\r"

These data suggest that abnormalities in thyroid function are not requisite neuroendocrine correlates of social phobia.\r"

Sonography of the ovaries was performed on day 13, and serum progesterone was measured on day 21 of each cycle. Elevated progesterone indicated ovulation. The presence of a maturing follicle supported this finding. All volunteers ovulated in the first cycle and no volunteers ovulated in the second and third cycles. However, 11 women ovulated when rifampin and the triphasic oral contraceptive were given concomitantly. The findings suggest there is no reason to believe that roxithromycin interferes with the efficacy of oral contraceptives.\r"

No correlation was found between the enzyme activities and antipyrine clearance or half-life. When microsomal enzyme activities were compared with the formation rate of 4-hydroxyantipyrine, 3-methylhydroxyantipyrine, and norantipyrine, a correlation was found only between benzo[alpha]pyrene hydroxylase and 3-methylhydroxyantipyrine (r = 0.89; p less than 0.0005). There was also a correlation between 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate cytochrome c reductase (0.56; p less than 0.05). Our data suggest that antipyrine elimination is not related to 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity in liver disease.

One hypothetical mechanism is that premature progesterone (P) secretion occurring in the high estradiol (E2) milieu produced by hMG triggers the spontaneous LH surge. To investigate this possibility, 11 rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys were stimulated with hMG. At maximal ovarian stimulation, monkeys were injected with 15 micrograms/kg P (n = 3), 30 micrograms/kg P (n = 3), or 1,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (n = 5; controls). Blood for E2, P, and LH was drawn twice daily in the periovulatory period and daily before and after this period. Laparoscopy was performed after P or hCG injection. In the 6 monkeys receiving P, no LH surges were detected. Further, postinjection P profiles and laparoscopy showed no evidence of ovulation. Controls demonstrated laparoscopic and hormonal evidence of ovulation. These findings suggest that P does not trigger LH surges in hMG-stimulated cycles.\r"

Additionally, it is not known whether gonadal steroid concentrations in the luteal phase of induced cycles in PCOS are predictive of pregnancy. In this prospective, randomized study comparing cycles using hMG alone (n = 26) with cycles using hMG with LA (n = 33), no differences were noted between treatment groups in progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), and P:E2 ratios on luteal days 3, 6, and 9. When all treatment cycles were pooled, there were no differences in P, E2, or P:E2 ratios, comparing conception and nonconception cycles. We conclude that adjunctive therapy with LA in PCOS patients undergoing ovulation induction with hMG does not alter the luteal phase concentrations of P, E2, and P:E2. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the serum concentrations of these luteal phase steroids and cycle fecundity.\r"

In 21 cycles the dominant follicle reduced in size after the LH peak (cystic corpus luteum cycles), and in 20 no shrinkage was seen (luteinized unruptured follicles). Progesterone concentrations in the early luteal phase were significantly reduced in the luteinized unruptured follicle cycles. Elevation in plasma FSH was seen in the early follicular and luteal phases of both cyst forming groups and may be due to disturbances in ovarian metabolism. Follicular rupture is important for efficient P release by the corpus luteum.\r"

The suppressive effect of GnRH-a on luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and sex steroid production is well documented. However, little is known regarding the effect of GnRH-a on other aspects of pituitary function. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of GnRH-a treatment on growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH)-stimulated GH release in premenopausal women. Eight control women and seven women, who were receiving a GnRH-a, were recruited. Before and after a bolus infusion of human GH-RH, blood samples were obtained over 3 hours and analyzed for GH by immunoassay. Basal GH and insulin-like growth factor levels were not statistically different between the two groups. However, basal levels of estradiol and the integrated GH response after GH-RH were significantly lower in the GnRH-a treated women. The reduction in GH-RH-stimulated GH release in GnRH-a treated women may be attributed to diminished endogenous estrogen secretion, or to direct pituitary suppression by GnRH-a, or both.\r"

In stimulated cycles the number of glands per square millimeter was positively correlated to the E2 level. The morphometric data point to a measurable difference between the study groups, indicating an insufficient secretory transformation of the tissue in infertile women when compared with a group of fertile women. The observations suggest that hormonal stimulation occasionally results in impaired development of the endometrial glands.\r"

Endogenous secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone was attenuated by 59% and 50%, respectively, after 2 weeks of orally administered NET. Twelve hours after a single 10-mg oral dose, significant levels of NET were measured in samples of peripheral (8.8 +/- 1.9 ng/mL) and ovarian venous blood (10.5 +/- 3.1 ng/mL), follicular fluid (7.1 +/- 2.1 ng/mL), and homogenates of ovarian tissue (8.0 +/- 0.6 ng/g). Furthermore, NET was detectable in follicular fluid 2 weeks after its withdrawal (863 +/- 149 pg/mL). However, there were no effects of NET on follicular fluid levels of estradiol and progesterone in vivo or on luteinized granulosa cell steroidogenesis in vitro.

  ".W": "The effects on three nutrition-sensitive plasma proteins of isocaloric feedings with three enteral formulas were compared in 10 tube-fed male nursing home residents. The enteral products were Isocal (based on whole protein), Peptamen (based on a mixture of oligopeptides), and Vivonex T.E.N. (based on free amino acids). The nutrition-sensitive plasma proteins were albumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein. After observation during four weeks of feeding with Isocal, each subject was then monitored during four weeks of Peptamen and four weeks of Vivonex T.E.N. The latter two products were alternated in a crossover design. The shift of Isocal to Peptamen did not significantly (P greater than .05) influence the serum level of albumin, transferrin, or retinol-binding protein. In contrast, the shift of Isocal to Vivonex T.E.N. or of Peptamen to Vivonex caused a significant (P less than .05) decline in all three plasma proteins, the kinetics of their reductions corresponding to their known half-lives. The behavior of the three nutrition-sensitive plasma proteins suggests that in elderly nursing home men without gastrointestinal disease the nutritional value of the protein component of the three formulas follows the order Isocal = Peptamen greater than Vivonex T.E.N. However, this conclusion will require confirmation by nitrogen balance studies.\r"

A modest expansion of the current (ie, after repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Law of 1988) Medicare benefit for persons needing relatively short-term nursing home and home care services would be a first step. For those with extended long-term service needs, a non-means tested, publicly funded program with joint federal-state financing and administration would provide coverage after a substantial elimination period and with an income-related copayment. Private long-term care insurance purchased through employers before retirement or in the periretirement period, through use of income or equity accumulated in life insurance, pension funds, or home ownership, would be used to fund the exclusionary period or copayments of the public program by those who wish to have greater protection for income or assets. The role of Medicaid would be limited to paying for the deductible, copayments, and initial long-stay expenses of those with low incomes and limited assets.\r"

The interfaces between short- and long-term care can be addressed by either a number of specific changes or more global approaches, such as one or another form of capitated care. Using the ratio of achieved/expected outcomes as a prominent part of a regulatory strategy offers a means to increase the flexibility of regulation to encourage innovation while retaining meaningful accountability. New combinations of housing and nursing care offer a way for both a better and more flexible way of living in the context of an approach that guarantees universal coverage of care together with an incentive to save to afford better accommodations.\r"

  ".W": "Although normal numbers of CD4+ T cells are present in the human neonate, cord blood CD4+ cells are deficient in their ability to provide help for antibody production. In the present studies, we have examined the cellular basis for this functional deficit by analyzing the phenotypic properties and immunoregulatory functions of the subsets of cord blood CD4+ cells defined by anti-CD45RA mAb. In contrast to CD4+ cells from adults, greater than 90% of cord blood CD4+ cells expressed the CD45RA, CD38, and Leu-8 membrane Ag. When neonatal CD4+ cells were cultured with adult B cells and PWM or anti-CD4+ mAb, no helper function was apparent. However, when the small number of CD4+CD45RA- cells in cord blood were purified and similarly analyzed, helper activity comparable to that of adult CD4+CD45RA- cells was found. This helper function was profoundly suppressed by the presence of even small numbers of cord blood (but not adult) CD4+CD45RA+ cells. Irradiation of mitomycin C treatment of neonatal CD4+CD45RA+ cells abrogated their suppressor activity, but did not induce helper capability. However, after activation with PHA and culture in IL-2, cord blood CD4+CD45RA+ cells lost their suppressor activity and acquired the ability to provide help for B cell differentiation. This functional maturation was accompanied by their conversion to the CD4+CD45RA- phenotype. Thus, whereas cord blood CD4+CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA- cells share certain properties with the analogous subsets in adults, our data show that the dominant immunoregulatory function of cord blood CD4+ cells is suppression mediated by CD4+CD45RA+ (and CD38+) cells. In view of these phenotypic and functional differences between neonatal and adult CD4+CD45RA+ cells, we propose that \"naive\" CD4+CD45RA+ cells undergo age-related maturational changes that are unrelated to their postulated activation-dependent post-thymic differentiation into CD4+CD45RA- \"memory\" cells capable of helper functions.\r"

The latter included donors with or without C alpha 1 or C alpha 2 gene deletions. Monoclonal human IgA1 and a genetically engineered IgA2 antibody, normal human serum and colostrum IgA were used as standards to estimate serum and saliva levels of Ag-specific antibodies. In normal individuals, there was a strong IgA1 preference of naturally acquired antibodies in serum against both polysaccharide Ag (PPS 6A, PPS 23, pneumococcal C-polysaccharide, and LPS from Escherichia coli) and protein Ag (Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin and HSV). Specific IgA2 in serum against the tested Ag were frequently not measurable. In contrast, most of the individuals with homozygous C alpha 1 gene deletions displayed substantial amounts of specific IgA2 against protein as well as polysaccharide Ag. The median levels of specific IgA in serum against protein Ag were approximately one-third as compared to normal individuals and one-fifth, or less, against polysaccharide Ag. Normal serum levels of IgA against the tested Ag, restricted to the IgA1 subclass, were noted in two individuals with IgA2 deficiency, one of whom carried a homozygous C alpha 2 gene deletion. Median values of specific IgA, against the tested Ag S. aureus alpha-toxin, HSV, and pneumococcal C-poly-saccharide, from normal healthy donors were approximately four to eight times higher in serum as compared to saliva. Individuals with homozygous C alpha 1 gene deletions displayed increased levels of the various specific IgA2 antibodies in saliva. In conclusion, the individuals with homozygous C alpha 1 gene deletions displayed decreased median levels of specific IgA antibodies in serum despite normal levels of total IgA. Normal levels of both specific IgA and total IgA in saliva were found.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that ligation of murine B cell membrane IgM or IgD can lead to inactivation of the signal transducing ability of unligated Ag receptors. We describe further studies of the molecular basis of this desensitization. Consistent with the possibility that ligand induced desensitization is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) are findings that demonstrate that both Ig binding ligands and PKC activators (DIC8 or PMA) induce desensitization in virtually all resting B cells. However, ligand-induced desensitization is longer lived than PMA- or DIC8-induced desensitization and insensitive to the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. Further, biochemical studies indicate that insufficient PKC activation is induced by ligation of membrane Ig to mediate the observed desensitization. Thus data indicate that PKC must play only a minor role in ligand-induced membrane Ig desensitization. Further studies explored the molecular source and target of effectors that mediate ligand-induced desensitization. Data indicate that phosphoinositide hydrolysis is neither necessary nor sufficient for ligand induction of desensitization. Finally, ligand-induced desensitization appears to be mediated by uncoupling of membrane Ig from G proteins that regulate phospholipase C because ligand desensitized cells are hyperresponsive to agents including ALF4- and mastoparan which activate G proteins leading to mobilization of Ca2+. Thus, the function of G proteins and further downstream elements that mediate Ca2+ mobilization is intact. Taken together, these data are most consistent with ligand-induced membrane Ig desensitization being mediated by a non-PKC, non phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis involving mechanism that has as its target a structure that is very proximal to the receptor, such as the receptor itself or a transducer complex analogous to CD3.\r"

To investigate the roles of these cytokines in vivo at the site of disease activity in human tuberculosis, we evaluated local cytokine production in patients with tuberculous pleuritis. Both TNF and IFN-gamma were selectively concentrated 5- to 30-fold in pleural fluid, compared to blood of the same patients. Messenger RNA for both cytokines was detected in pleural tissue by in situ hybridization, suggesting that selective cytokine concentration is due to local cytokine production. Two Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall components, the protein-peptidoglycan complex and lipoarabinomannan, caused dose-dependent release of TNF by pleural fluid mononuclear cells and may constitute the stimuli for TNF production in the pleural space. In contrast to results obtained for TNF release, the protein-peptidoglycan complex, but not lipoarabinomannan, stimulated IFN-gamma release by pleural fluid mononuclear cells. The clinical manifestations of tuberculous pleuritis, such as fever, exudative pleural effusion, and tissue necrosis, may be due to the effects of elevated local TNF concentrations, produced in response to mycobacterial cell wall components.\r"

To identify potential effects on two types of blastocyst-derived cells, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha/beta, and IFN-gamma were tested for the ability to modulate proliferation and the expression of class I MHC Ag by rat trophoblast cells and embryonic fibroblasts. The three cytokines had opposite influences on cellular proliferation by the two types of cells. Growth of the trophoblast cells was inhibited by TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha/beta, and IFN-gamma, whereas both TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha/beta enhanced fibroblast proliferation. The two endogenous cytokines had different effects on class I Ag expression by trophoblast cells and fibroblasts: TNF-alpha failed to induce trophoblast cell class I Ag and IFN-alpha/beta was a poor inducer whereas fibroblast Ag were induced by both cytokines. Moreover, combinations of TNF-alpha and IFN did not increase trophoblast cell class I Ag whereas the same combinations synergized to induce class I Ag expression by fibroblasts. In contrast, IFN-gamma was a highly efficient inducer on both types of cells. The results suggest that 1) cytokines in the uteroplacental unit may orchestrate some of the events associated with placental and embryonic development by exerting differential effects on two embryologically distinct types of cells and that 2) infections may disrupt normal events.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we have characterized T cell ontogeny in mice transgenic for the V gamma 1.1J gamma 4C gamma 4 (TcR gamma 4) TCR chain gene by analyzing the T cell surface phenotype and microarchitecture of the transgenic lymphoid organs during development. The first wave of V gamma 3J gamma 1C gamma 1 TCR+ thymocytes that appear in the thymus at day 14 of gestation were virtually absent in the TCR gamma 4 transgenic mice. However, comparable levels of total gamma delta+ thymocytes were present in the TCR gamma 4 transgenic mice, suggesting that these thymocytes expressed a transgene receptor. In addition, the appearance of significant numbers of TCR alpha beta+ T cells occurred earlier (day 17 of fetal development) in the transgenic thymus. After birth, thymuses from TCR gamma 4 transgenic mice were characterized by a consistent increase in the number of TCR gamma delta+ thymocytes and a transient increase (between 2 and 4 wk of age) in the absolute number of TCR+ thymocytes (2- to 4-fold) compared with thymuses from normal mice. Immunohistologic analysis of the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes from 2-day and 3-wk-old transgenic mice showed significant differences to controls only in regions harboring mature, functional T cell subsets which may be the result of bidirectional signaling between lymphocyte subsets (influenced by transgene expression) and stromal elements. The results demonstrate that striking differences, leading to the earlier appearance of mature T cells, occurred in both the fetal and neonatal thymus and periphery of mice that expressed a TCR gamma 4 transgene. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that expression of the TCR gamma 4 chain gene, early in ontogeny, has a positive influence on the development of the T cell compartment.\r"

The skeletal muscle-derived L8 myoblasts bound and spread on substratum coated with SC5b-9, and with the vitronectin/S-protein component of SC5b-9. The myoblasts did not adhere to substratum coated with collagen, laminin, or fibronectin. The cell attachment was blocked by antibody to vitronectin/S-protein, whereas antibody to the other components C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9 had minimal effect. The cells were not bound to free vitronectin because attachment activity was removed by adsorption with an anti-C6 antibody column. The L8 cell attachment was dependent on divalent cations, was blocked by synthetic peptides containing the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, and was inhibited by antivitronectin receptor antibody. These results indicate that cells adhere to the SC5b-9 complex through interaction of the vitronectin component with an integrin vitronectin receptor. Cell attachment to terminal C complexes could be used for leukocyte adherence and migration during inflammation, and also for attachment of tissue cells during regeneration after disease or traumatic injury.\r"

These data suggest an integral role for monocyte lipoxygenase in the generation by activated monocytes of the extracellular superoxide anion that participates in the oxidation of LDL and the conversion of LDL to a cytotoxin. Monocyte-modified LDL may be a mediator in tissue damage that accompanies atherosclerosis or occurs at sites of inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "90293470\r", 
  ".W": "The high affinity IgG FcR Fc gamma RI, CD64, plays important roles in the immune response. Fc gamma RI is predominantly expressed on monocytes and macrophages, and barely detectable on neutrophils. rIFN-gamma markedly increases the expression of Fc gamma RI on neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and myeloid cell lines such as U-937, HL-60, and THP-1. Glucocorticoids inhibit the augmentation of Fc gamma RI expression by rIFN-gamma on neutrophils and myeloid cell lines, but enhance the augmentation of Fc gamma RI expression by rIFN-gamma on monocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of rIFN-gamma and dexamethasone (Dex) on the steady state level of Fc gamma RI mRNA in U-937 cells, neutrophils, and monocytes by hybridizing total RNA with the Fc gamma RI cDNA probe, p135. We found that the amount of Fc gamma RI mRNA increased within 1 h of treatment with rIFN-gamma in all three cell types. This initial induction of Fc gamma RI mRNA by rIFN-gamma was completely blocked by an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, actinomycin D, suggesting that the rIFN-gamma-mediated induction of Fc gamma RI mRNA is dependent on gene transcription. Dex, used in combination with rIFN-gamma, partially blocked the induction of Fc gamma RI mRNA by rIFN-gamma in U-937 cells and neutrophils, but caused a synergistic increase in Fc gamma RI mRNA levels in monocytes. The inhibitory effect of Dex on the steady state level of Fc gamma RI mRNA in U-937 cells was blocked by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, suggesting that Dex-induced proteins were involved in the regulation of Fc gamma RI expression. This study indicates that the regulation of Fc gamma RI expression on U-937 cells, neutrophils, and monocytes by rIFN-gamma and Dex occurs, at least in part, at the mRNA level. rIFN-gamma increases the steady state level of Fc gamma RI mRNA through a common pathway among U-937 cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, whereas the effect of Dex on rIFN-gamma-induced Fc gamma RI mRNA is cell-type specific.\r"

The early increase in expression of c-myc mRNA was mediated by both enhanced initiation of c-myc transcription and posttranscriptional stabilization of c-myc mRNA. Stimulation of HL-60 cells with A23187 for 30 min increased transcription of both exons 1 and 3 of c-myc by 125%. After 1 h of treatment with A23187, the half-life of c-myc mRNA increased to 150% of control. The late decrease in c-myc expression induced by A23187 was primarily mediated by interruption of elongation of c-myc nascent mRNA beyond exon 1. The combination of calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate acted synergistically to inhibit expression of c-myc mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies employing Southern blot analyses have detected multiple kappa-homologous sequences within EcoRI-digested DNA isolated from kappa 1b6 homozygous rabbits and kappa 1b6 L chain secreting RMH H158 cell line. These results are very unexpected because the published partial protein sequence for the kappa 1b6 C region is incompatible with an EcoRI restriction endonuclease recognition sequence at the nucleotide level for this allotype. To determine their identity, the kappa-homologous sequences were isolated from DNA extracted from a kappa 1b6 L chain secreting RMH H158 cell line by molecular cloning. Structural analyses demonstrated these sequences to contain genetic information encoding the majority of the kappa 1b6 L chain gene locus. The protein sequence deduced from the kappa 1b6 C region gene was shown to differ from the published partial kappa 1b6 C region protein sequence at five amino acid positions. One of these differences results in a glycine to serine interchange that introduces an EcoRI restriction endonuclease recognition site within the kappa 1b6 C region gene. Subsequent genomic Southern blot analyses confirmed this structural assignment. Based on these data, the EcoRI-sensitive kappa-homologous fragments present within the genomes of the RMH H158 cell line and kappa 1b6 homozygous rabbits represent the nominal kappa 1 gene and not an alternative kappa isotype or kappa pseudogene. Rabbit Ig kappa 1 allelic nucleotide sequence homology comparisons have shown the isolated kappa 1b6 J-C gene locus to display common structural features previously identified in other kappa 1 alleles.\r"

  ".W": "A beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m)-deficient variant of YAC-1, A.H-2-, was transfected with a genomic beta 2m clone. Transfected cells were used to investigate the role of beta 2m in IFN-induced protection from NK cell lysis. IFN-gamma treatment of the NK-sensitive murine YAC-1 lymphoma results in reduced sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis in parallel with increased expression of its constitutively low MHC class I expression. It was previously shown that the A.H-2- variant had lost both these capacities, although it retained other responses to IFN-gamma. Here beta 2m transfection restored the YAC-1 phenotype with respect to an inducible expression of MHC class I molecules and a concomitant protection from NK cell lysis after treatment with IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma the NK sensitivity of the transfectants did not differ significantly from A.H-2-. A similar protection from NK cell lysis, in parallel with enhanced MHC class I expression, was observed for in vivo-passaged beta 2m transfectants whereas no protection was found for in vivo-passaged A.H-2- cells. The present study provides evidence that the IFN-gamma-mediated protection from NK cell lysis is dependent on beta 2m expression in the YAC-1 lymphoma. Restoration of MHC class I assembly, transport, and concomitantly an IFN-gamma augmentable cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules is a possible explanation for the effect of beta 2m.\r"

The donor-derived thymocytes of AKR----C3H chimeras on day 14 after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) contained a large number of blastlike CD4+CD8+ cells which represent relatively immature thymocytes, whereas those on day 21 after BMT consisted of small sized CD4+,CD8+ cells which represent a great part in normal thymocytes. To define the developmental stage at which clonal deletion of self-reactive T cells occurs in adult thymus, we followed the fate of V beta 6- or V beta 11-bearing T cells in the donor-derived thymocytes at the early stage of AKR----C3H chimeras. Mature thymocytes expressing high intensity of V beta 6 or V beta 11, which are involved in recognition of Mls-1a or MHC I-E gene products, respectively, were deleted from the donor-derived thymocytes on day 21. Immature thymocytes expressing low intensity of V beta 6 in CD3low thymocyte fraction decreased in proportion, whereas those expressing low intensity of V beta 11 rather increased in proportion in the donor-derived thymocytes of AKR----C3H chimeras from day 14 to day 21 after BMT. These results suggest that the clonal deletion of V beta 6-positive cells occurs just at the stage of immature CD3lowCD4+CD8+ cells, whereas the clonal deletion of V beta 11-positive cells may begin at the transitional stage from CD3lowCD4+CD8+ cells to CD3high single positive cells. Timing of negative selection of thymocytes may vary in distinct T cells capable of recognizing different self-Ag.\r"

  ".W": "After Ag and/or mitogen stimulation, cloned mouse Th1 and Th2 cells produce different cytokines that contribute to induction of particular B cell isotype responses. In this regard, IL-5 produced by Th2 cells has been shown to enhance IgA synthesis in LPS-triggered splenic (SP) B cell or in unstimulated Peyer's patch (PP) B cell cultures. This raises the possibility that Th2 cells may occur in higher frequency in gut-associated tissues, because B cells in these areas are committed to IgA synthesis. We have used an ELISPOT assay to detect individual T cells producing IFN-gamma or IL-5. For the IL-5 assay, the mAb TRFK-5 and biotinylated TRFK-4 were used in coating and detection, respectively, whereas the mAb R4-6A2 and biotinylated XMG 1.2 were similarly used for enumeration of IFN-gamma-specific spot forming cells (SFC). Specificity of each assay was tested by using Con A-activated, cloned Th1 (H66-61) or Th2 (CDC-25) cells, where the Th1 cells only produced IFN-gamma SFC and the Th2 cells only gave IL-5-specific spots. Further, preincubation of biotinylated TRFK-4 or XMG 1.2 with rIL-5 or IFN-gamma, respectively, abrogated the formation of specific spots when tested with Con A-activated SP CD4+ T cells. Both IFN-gamma and IL-5 were produced de novo, because treatment of T cells with cycloheximide inhibited both IFN-gamma and IL-5 SFC. We have assessed the numbers of T cells spontaneously secreting these cytokines in PP and in lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocyte (LPL and IEL) populations. Moderate levels of IL-5 SFC occurred in the IEL subset, whereas higher levels existed in the LPL population. Although significant numbers of IFN-gamma SFC (Th1-type) were also seen in LPLs, the frequency of IL-5 SFC was always higher (Th1:Th2 in LPL = 1:3). In IELs, equal numbers of IFN-gamma and IL-5 SFC were seen. Interestingly, CD8+ IEL T cells produced these two cytokines. In contrast, T cells freshly isolated from PP, an IgA inductive site, contained smaller numbers of IL-5- or IFN-gamma-secreting cells and SP T cells had essentially no SFC. When PP or SP T cells were stimulated with Con A, significant and approximately equal numbers of IFN-gamma- and IL-5-producing cells appeared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of CD4 molecule in T cell activation, the effect of anti-CD4 on T cell IL-2 production was examined by using an alloreactive Th clone. The alloreactive T cell used in the present experiments produced IL-2 in response to soluble anti-CD3 epsilon-chain (anti-CD3) without accessory cell or insoluble antibody carrier. The IL-2 production was suppressed by the addition of anti-CD4 in cultures. An intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of the T cell clone was elevated by anti-CD3 stimulation, but the elevation was suppressed in the presence of anti-CD4. When the clone was stimulated in Ca2(+)-free medium, the elevation of [Ca2+]i was not observed. When Ca2+ influx was induced by calcium ionophore A23187 or ionomycin, the clone produced IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 in the presence of anti-CD4. When polyclonal T cell line or several other alloreactive T cell clones were examined for their anti-CD3 response, essentially the same results as mentioned above were obtained. Taken together, these results suggest that the slow and sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i is an essential signal for IL-2 production of T cells, and that anti-CD4 suppresses the IL-2 production by interfering the [Ca2+]i elevation. The significance of CD4 molecules in murine T cell activation was discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of accessory cell-derived signals in promoting growth and lymphokine production by murine Th1 clones. Five of six Th1 clones failed to proliferate to immobilized anti-CD3 antibody despite producing IL-2 and IFN-gamma. These clones became unresponsive to Ag after exposure to anti-CD3. With the addition of irradiated splenic accessory cells (SAC), Th1 clones proliferated to anti-CD3 and produced greater amounts of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. High doses of plate-bound anti-CD3 completely inhibited responses of these clones to IL-2 and diminished the growth-promoting activity of SAC. The costimulatory effects of SAC on growth of Th1 clones were also seen in the presence of exogenous IL-2, indicating that enhanced IL-2 production alone was not responsible for the costimulatory effect. Delivery of the costimulatory signal from SAC required their close proximity to the T cells. The costimulatory activity of SAC was not reproduced by the addition of IL-1, IL-6, or IL-1 plus IL-6. IL-7 induced weak proliferation of Th1 clones, but did not synergize with plate-bound anti-CD3. Our results suggest a model in which SAC-derived costimulatory signals regulate growth of Th1 cells primarily at the level of cell cycle progression rather than at the level of IL-2 production.\r"

Group FL (n = 17) began LA on day 1 and hMG on day 3. Compared to FL, more ova were collected, more ova fertilized, and more pregnancies resulted per initiated cycle in groups achieving suppression before hMG stimulation. Fewer days were necessary to attain suppression for L vs F. After achieving suppression, patients were maintained on either 0.5 mg LA or 0.25 mg LA daily during hMG coadministration with similar results. Lower maintenance doses of LA during hMG did not decrease the amount of hMG needed but retained the benefits of LA. We recommend luteal initiation of LA to achieve suppression before hMG.\r"

  ".W": "The principles of dose-response and combination chemotherapy were basic to the design of the initial curative standard-dose treatment regimens for leukemias, lymphomas, and testis cancer. Agents were selected with different dose-limiting toxicities, resulting in subadditive toxicity in combination. A fourth principle in the design of curative regimens was to combine agents with different mechanisms of action to avoid cross-resistance. Based on these principles, combinations of the highest tolerated doses of active noncross-resistant agents are required to decrease the emergence of drug resistance and achieve optimum cytotoxicity. Hematopoietic stem-cell support provides a mechanism for significantly increasing the doses of active agents, a strategy that has resulted in the cure of 10% to 50% of selected patients with lymphoma who could not be cured with standard-dose therapy. The lack of sufficiently effective cytoreductive conditioning regimens remains the major impediment to improving the high-dose therapy of patients with solid tumors. In this study, 27 patients with solid tumors were treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb) in a phase I-II study. Severe mucositis and neurotoxicity were dose-limiting. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination was 6.0 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2 of thiotepa, and 800 mg/m2 of carboplatin. There were two deaths (7%) of sepsis, and an overall response rate of 72% in refractory tumors (81% in breast cancer). CTCb is a combination with low morbidity and high cytoreductive efficacy designed to exploit the principles of curative cancer chemotherapy.\r"

IL-2 was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days. IFN-gamma was administered by a daily intramuscular (IM) injection during the 5 days of IL-2 administration. Treatment was repeated twice after 9-day rest periods. After a 2-week rest, patients without evidence of tumor progression were retreated. Natural killer (NK)- and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-cell activity were assayed in each patient before treatment, on day 1, and on day 5 of each cycle. Constitutional symptoms occurred in most patients but were not dose-limiting. Other toxicities included hypotension responsive to fluids, transient elevations in liver function tests, erythema/pruritus, eosinophilia, and transient leukopenia/thrombocytopenia. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination was 1 x 10(6) U/m2/d of IL-2 combined with 0.50 mg/m2/d of IFN-gamma. The dose-limiting toxicity was pulmonary manifesting as rales and shortness of breath. The dose of the combination that resulted in the optimal generation of in vivo LAK-cell activity was a dose of at least 0.25 mg/m2/d of IFN-gamma combined with 1 x 10(6) U/m2/d of IL-2. Objective clinical responses were seen in five of 26 patients. These included a partial response of 2 months duration in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), mixed responses in a patient with NHL and two patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and an ongoing assessable response in a patient with bone metastases from RCC. The recommended dose for phase II trials of this combination is 0.50 mg/m2 of IFN-gamma and 1 x 10(6) U of IL-2.\r"

This effect of delta 9-THC was approximately three times greater in rats than in mice. When the behavioral effects of the cannabinoids were characterized further in the mouse, it was found that delta 9-11-THC, 12 beta-NH2-delta 8-THC, levonantradol and (-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH produced effects that were similar to those of delta 9-THC. The effect was found to be enantioselective in that (+)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH was inactive even at a dose 200 times greater than an active dose of (-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH. In contrast to the effects of delta 9-THC, mice treated with cannabidiol and nabilone spent a greater amount of time in the open arm of the maze, an effect similar to that produced by diazepam, the reference anxiolytic agent. In this test situation, 11-nor-delta 8-THC-9-carboxylic acid and abnormal cannabidiol did not alter the behavior of the animals at doses up to 20 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. Pretreatment with either the bidirectional inverse agonist carboline-3-carboxylate or diazepam (at doses that did not modify normal behavior on the elevated plus maze) blocked the effect of delta 9-THC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under all three schedules, alprazolam (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in response rate. The rate-decreasing effects of alprazolam were attenuated by drugs known to have benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist action: Ro 15-1788 (0.01 and 0.3 mg/kg), Ro 15-4513 (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) and 3-(methoxycarbonyl)amino-beta-carboline (10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg). These latter drugs alone either had no effect on or decreased fixed-ratio responding. Alprazolam also was tested in combination with lorazepam under the two FI schedules. In general, low doses of lorazepam, equal to or less than those having little effect on response rate when given alone, increased suppressed and nonsuppressed responding when combined with low to moderate doses of alprazolam. The results show that although the rate-decreasing effects of alprazolam probably are due to actions at BZ recognition sites, alprazolam alone does not have typical BZ-like agonist effects on FI responding; it did, however, potentiate the behavioral effects of lorazepam.\r"

Topical application of 0.6 N HCl on the gastric mucosa inhibited the endothelium-dependent increase in mucosal hemodynamics estimated using organ-reflectance spectrophotometry induced by vagal stimulation or acetylcholine, but not by papaverine. Collagenase, gossypol, hemoglobin and ascorbic acid have been reported to inhibit the endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inhibited increase in mucosal hemodynamics induced by vagal stimulation and acetylcholine. These inhibitors and methylene blue significantly enhanced the gastric lesion induced by 0.45 N HCl. Intra-arterial or topical application of nitrites (sodium nitrite and isoamyl nitrite) increased mucosal hemodynamics. Oral administration of nitrites prevented the formation of 0.6 N HCl-induced gastric lesion. These results suggest that EDRF plays an important role in the protection of gastric mucosa against HCl. Reduced endothelium-dependent increase in mucosal blood flow may be an etiology of gastric lesion in rats.\r"

Rats were anesthetized (50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital i.p.), and sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Four hours later, pulmonary effluent immunoreactive thromboxane (iTXB2) levels were significantly increased (156.8%) and pulmonary vascular reactivity to U46619 (50-200 ng) was significantly (P less than .05) decreased compared to lungs from nonseptic controls. This decreased vascular reactivity was not seen in lungs from cecally ligated rats challenged with angiotensin II (5-200 ng). Sham surgery did not alter pulmonary iTXB2 synthesis nor did it result in a depressed vascular response to U46619. Rats pretreated with ibuprofen (15 mg/kg i.v.) did not show the sepsis-associated increase in iTXB2 levels nor was a decrease in pulmonary vascular reactivity to U46619 observed. These data indicate that a sepsis-associated increase in TXA2 and/or other cyclooxygenase products can alter the pulmonary vascular response to the TXA2 mimic, U46619.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which toluene decreased synaptosomal phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was investigated by studying degradative and synthetic phospholipid pathways. Toluene stimulated a PE-specific phospholipase (PLase) C both in vivo (44-75%) and in vitro (20-30%) whereas PLase A, PLase D and base exchange enzymes were unchanged. Toluene, in vivo, also increased the synthesis of PE (27%) when expressed as [3H]ethanolamine incorporation into [3H]PE, but had no effect on PE synthesis when administered in vitro. Perhaps this reflects a compensatory mechanism in synaptosomes to replace PE via increasing de novo synthesis. Phospholipid methylation, an event proposed to be related to the transduction of singals across membranes, as well as a measure of membrane function, was studied. Toluene was found to rapidly increase phospholipid methylation (43%, 15 min), followed by a significant decrease (35%, 1 hr). Another measure of membrane, as well as cell function used in these studies was ATPase activity. Toluene, both in vivo and in vitro, stimulated Na+, K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity (20-30%, 15-30 min), whereas Mg(++)-ATPase and Ca(++)-ATPase were unaffected, an indication that toluene alters neuronal cell function. Membrane fluidity studies using fluorescence polarization reported that toluene, both in vivo and in vitro, increased the outer synaptosomal membrane fluidity using the probe trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene, whereas no effect was observed on the central core fluidity using diphenylhexatriene. These are the first studies to demonstrate that an organic solvent effects only specific membrane region fluidities. One possibility is that early synaptic alterations resulting from toluene exposure may be preceded by increases in outer membrane fluidity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 251: 439-447, 1989). Concentrations of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured in rats after i.c.v. and i.v. administration of LHRH alone or in conjunction with inhibitors of EP 24.15. In animals treated with two potent EP 24.15 inhibitors, i.v. and i.c.v. LHRH injections induced a much greater and longer-lasting increase of plasma LH and FSH concentrations than in controls Two and 4 hr after administration of the inhibitors and LHRH, hormone concentrations were one order of magnitude greater than in controls. The magnitudes and durations of the increases were similar to those after administration of [D-Trp6]-LHRH or [D-Leu6, Des-Gly-NH2(10)]-LHRH ethylamide, two \"superactive\" analogs of LHRH, which are resistant to degradation by EP 24.15, due to the presence of a D-amino acid in position 6. It is concluded that LHRH degradation by EP 24.15 limits the magnitude and duration of the response of the pituitary to LHRH, and that increases in plasma LH and FSH similar to those obtained after administration of superactive analogs can be also obtained with the natural hormone, provided that its degradation is prevented by EP 24.15 inhibitors. Accordingly, the increased in vivo activity of the superactive LHRH analogs can be largely attributed to their resistance to degradation by EP 24.15.\r"

On the contrary, the treatment with L-DOPA further enhanced the hypersensitivity of adenylate cyclase to dopamine stimulation that follows striatal denervation. In addition, the apomorphine-induced rotations were strongly potentiated. The latter effect was antagonized by morphine given acutely shortly before the dopamine agonist. On the other hand, the efficacy of [D-Ala2]-methionine enkephalinamide to inhibit striatal adenylate cyclase was decreased in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats chronically treated with L-dopa. Moreover, in these animals, when naltrexone was given chronically together with L-dopa, the supersensitivity of the enzyme to dopamine stimulation did not develop. Finally, in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, chronic morphine, similarly to L-dopa, further enhanced the responses of adenylate cyclase to dopamine stimulation. These data suggest that prolonged indirect activation of striatal opiate receptors and their consequent desensitization could be among the causes of the hyperactivity of D-1 dopamine receptors that follows chronic L-dopa treatment.\r"

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed on the Sonolith 2000 device with the patient under intravenous narcotic sedation with fentanyl. Enzymatic activity per gram of urinary creatinine was consistently but not significantly higher before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy than in control subjects. All 4 enzymes were elevated 24 hours after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, with the increases in beta-galactosidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme being statistically significant. However, by 7 days after the procedure the enzymes had decreased to pre-procedure concentrations or below. These data suggest that any renal tubular damage induced by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is of limited magnitude and brief duration.\r"

When used in combination with interferon gamma (IFNG) or chemotherapeutic drugs targeted at DNA topoisomerase II, synergistic cytotoxicity has been observed. Investigations of the anti-tumor activity of recombinant mouse TNF in a mouse bladder tumor model (MBT-2) were performed. The cytotoxicity of TNF and low dose actinomycin-D (AMD) against MBT-2 in vitro was examined alone and following preincubation with IFNG. The activity of TNF/AMD in vivo utilizing an intravesical implantation mode (MBT-2) was also evaluated. TNF alone had no cytotoxic effect in vitro. TNF/AMD was cytotoxic for MBT-2 growth in vitro. Maximum cytotoxicity (86%) occurred at one microgram./ml. TNF/one microgram./ml. AMD with 50% cytotoxicity at .64 micrograms./ml. TNF/one/microgram./ml. AMD. A two hour preincubation with IFNG markedly increased the cytotoxicity of TNF/AMD whereas longer incubations did not enhance cytotoxic activity. TNF alone and in combination with AMD did not significantly reduce the percentage of intravesical tumor outgrowth in vivo compared to controls. This study demonstrated that TNF/AMD exhibits cytotoxicity for MBT-2 cells in vitro but is ineffective in reducing implantation of intravesical tumors in vivo. The in vitro data suggest brief exposure of MBT-2 cells to IFNG augments the subsequent anti-tumor activity of TNF/AMD.\r"

We have attempted to improve patency of thrombosed vein grafts by direct infusion of vasodilator and anticoagulant drugs after surgical thrombectomy. Among 212 infragenicular vein grafts, 16 (7.5%) required thrombectomy within 30 days of surgery (14 in situ saphenous vein, 1 composite vein, and 1 cephalic vein graft). Causes for failure were corrected in four (graft twist, intimal tear, suture failure, and external compression), resulting in prolonged patency. No cause for failure was apparent in the 12 remaining grafts after balloon catheter thrombectomy and arteriography. Two of these grafts occluded within 10 days despite multiple attempts at vein patch angioplasty, distal graft extension, and repeat thrombectomy with systemic anticoagulation. In the remaining 10 grafts, a small polyethylene catheter was placed in a proximal vein branch for direct intragraft drug infusion. Heparin (10 units/min) and nitroglycerin (50 micrograms/min) were the agents infused most frequently, for a mean duration of 52 hours after thrombectomy. Of these 10 infused grafts, 8 remained patent during a mean 17-month follow-up (range, 6 to 38 months). This was accomplished despite previous and repeated failures of thrombectomy and systemic anticoagulation in seven of these eight grafts. Two infused grafts rethrombosed within 30 days of infusion, resulting in amputation. No catheter-related complications occurred. Increased thrombogenicity, intimal injury, and spasm after balloon catheter thrombectomy may contribute to vein graft rethrombosis in the absence of technical defects. Direct intragraft infusion of nitroglycerin and heparin contributed to prolonged salvage of 80% of thrombosed vein grafts in this preliminary experience.\r"

The survival rate was 25% for cardiac support patients and 47% for respiratory failure patients (36% overall survival). Mechanical complications included membrane lung failure, tubing rupture, and pump failure, all managed without mortality. Physiologic complications included bleeding, pneumothorax, cardiac arrest, renal failure, hepatic failure, and brain injury. The major cause of death was irreversible injury to lung, heart, or brain.

During hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, the pH-stat method of acid-base management produces relative hypercarbia. To determine whether pH-stat management produces relative hypercarbia. To determine whether pH-stat management induces intracerebral steals, we investigated nine patients with cerebrovascular disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. During hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, arterial carbon dioxide tension was varied in random order between 40 mm Hg and 60 mm Hg (uncorrected for body temperature). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by clearance of 133 xenon injected into the arterial inflow cannula. Nasopharyngeal temperature (26.8 degrees-28.0 degrees +/- 2.2 degrees-3.0 degrees C), perfusion flow rate (2.14-2.18 +/- 0.70-0.73 L/min/m2), mean arterial pressure (67-68 +/- 6-9 mm Hg), arterial carbon dioxide tension (302-308 +/- 109-113 mm Hg), and hematocrit (23% +/- 4%) were maintained within narrow limits in each patient during arterial carbon dioxide tension manipulation. Global mean cerebral blood flow values were similar to previously reported values in patients free of cerebrovascular disease; patients in this study averaged 15.2 +/- 2.5 ml/100 gm/min at an arterial carbon dioxide tension of 46.1 +/- 8.4 mm Hg and 25.3 +/- 6.1 ml/100 gm/min at an arterial carbon dioxide tension of 71.1 +/- 11.8 mm Hg. Carbon dioxide reactivity, defined as mean global cerebral blood flow (in ml/100 gm/min) divided by arterial carbon dioxide tension (in mm Hg), was similar in the region having the lowest regional cerebral blood flow and in the brain as a whole. No patient developed evidence of an intracerebral steal at the higher arterial carbon dioxide tension. During hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, higher levels of arterial carbon dioxide tension, such as those associated with the pH-stat management technique, are apparently not associated with potentially harmful redistribution of cerebral blood flow in patients with cerebrovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To determine the effects of etidronate (a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption) in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, we conducted a prospective, two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in 429 women who had one to four vertebral compression fractures plus radiographic evidence of osteopenia. METHODS. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with phosphate (1.0 g) or placebo twice daily on days 1 through 3, etidronate (400 mg) or placebo daily on days 4 through 17, and supplemental calcium (500 mg) daily on days 18 through 91 (group 1, placebo and placebo; group 2, phosphate and placebo; group 3, placebo and etidronate; and group 4, phosphate and etidronate). The treatment cycles were repeated eight times. The bone density of the spine was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry, and the rates of new vertebral fractures were determined from sequential radiographs. RESULTS. After two years, the patients receiving etidronate (groups 3 and 4) had significant increases in their mean (+/- SE) spinal bone density (4.2 +/- 0.8 percent and 5.2 +/- 0.7 percent, respectively; P less than 0.017). The rate of new vertebral fractures was reduced by half in the etidronate-treated patients (groups 3 and 4 combined) as compared with the patients who did not receive etidronate (groups 1 and 2 combined) (29.5 vs. 62.9 fractures per 1000 patient-years; P = 0.043); the effect of treatment was most striking in the subgroup of patients with the lowest spinal bone mineral density at base line, in whom fracture rates were reduced by two thirds (42.3 vs. 132.7 fractures per 1000 patient-years; P = 0.004). The addition of phosphate provided no apparent benefit. There were no significant adverse effects of treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Intermittent cyclical therapy with etidronate for two years significantly increases spinal bone mass and reduces the incidence of new vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes into the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas (insulitis) followed by destruction of insulin-secreting beta-cells leading to overt diabetes. The best model for the disease is the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. Two unusual features of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the NOD mouse are the absence of I-E and the presence of unique I-A molecules (I-ANOD), in which aspartic acid at position 57 of the beta-chain is replaced by serine. This feature is also found in the HLA-DQ chain of many Caucasians with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have previously reported that the expression of I-E prevents the development of insulitis in NOD mouse. Here we report that the expression of I-Ak (A alpha kA beta k) in transgenic NOD mice can also prevent insulitis, and that this protection is seen not only when the I-A beta-chain has aspartic acid as residue 57, but also when this residue is serine. These results show that the single amino-acid substitution at position 57 of the I-A beta-chain from aspartic acid to serine is not sufficient for the development of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The first inductive interaction in amphibian development is mesoderm induction, when a signal from the vegetal hemisphere of the blastula induces mesoderm from overlying equatorial cells. Recently, several 'mesoderm-inducing factors' (MIFs) have been discovered. These cause isolated Xenopus animal caps to form mesodermal cell types such as muscle, instead of their normal fate of epidermis. The MIFs fall into two classes. One comprises members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, and the other members of the transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta) family. Of the latter group, the most potent is XTC-MIF, a protein produced by Xenopus XTC cells. Here we show that XTC-MIF is the homologue of mammalian activin A. Activins modulate the release of follicle-stimulating hormone from cultured anterior pituitary cells and cause the differentiation of two erythroleukaemia cell lines. Our results indicate that these molecules may also act in early development during formation of the mesoderm.\r"

Although the mesoderm-inducing factor (MIF) from X. laevis XTC cells (XTC-MIF) has properties similar to TGF-beta, this factor is still unidentified. Recently, we obtained a number of homogeneous cell lines from the heterogeneous XTC population, which differ in their MIF production. Only one, XTC-GTX-11, produced MIF, although it was similar to the rest of the clones in its production of known growth factors, including TGF-beta activity. This observation, together with the identification of activin A as a potent MIF led us to study the parallel activities of MIF and activin. Here we report an analysis of activin-like activity from XTC cells and some of the XTC clones, including XTC-GTX-11. There is a clear consistent correlation between MIF activity and presence of activin activity, indicating that XTC-MIF is the Xenopus homologue of mammalian activin.\r"

  ".U": "90294909\r", 
  ".W": "Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is one of the most common hereditary haemolytic anaemias. HS red cells from both autosound dominant and recessive variants are spectrin-deficient, which correlates with the severity of the disease. Some patients with recessive HS have a mutation in the spectrin alpha-2 domain (S.L.M. et al., unpublished observations), and a few dominant HS patients have an unstable beta-spectrin that is easily oxidized, which damages the protein 4.1 binding site and weakens spectrin-actin interactions. In most patients, however, the cause of spectrin deficiency is unknown. The alpha- and beta-spectrin loci are on chromosomes 1 and 14 respectively. The only other genetic locus for HS is SPH2, on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p11). This does not correspond to any of the known loci of genes for red cell membrane proteins including protein 4.1 (1p36.2-p34), the anion exchange protein (AE1, band 3; 17q21-qter), glycophorin C (2q14-q21), and beta-actin (7pter-q22). Human erythrocyte ankyrin, which links beta-spectrin to the anion exchange protein, has recently been cloned. We now show that the ankyrin gene maps to chromosome 8p11.2, and that one copy is missing from DNA of two unrelated children with severe HS and heterozygous deletions of chromosome 8 (del(8)(p11-p21.1)). Affected red cells are also ankyrin-deficient. The data suggest that defects or deficiency or ankyrin are responsible for HS at the SPH2 locus.\r"

  ".W": "The metameric pattern of the Drosophila embryo is regulated by a combination of maternal and zygotic genes. The segment-polarity class of genes are required for the correct patterning within each segmental unit. Mutations in any one of these genes results in deletions and duplications of parts of each segment. The segment-polarity genes act coordinately by means of local cellular interactions to assign and maintain an identity for each cell in the segment, and to establish segment boundaries. Here we describe the molecular characterization of a novel segment-polarity gene, zeste-white3 (zw3). Embryos derived from germ lines that are homozygous for zw3 mutations (zw3 embryos) have phenotypes similar to embryos that are mutant for the segment-polarity gene naked (nkd). These embryos lack most of the ventral denticles, which are differentiated structures derived from the most anterior region of each segment. We have isolated the zw3 gene and compared the structure of one maternal and one zygotic transcript encoded by the gene. The zw3 gene is unique among the segment-polarity genes so far characterized, in that it encodes proteins that have homology to serine-threonine protein kinases. This indicates that zw3 may play a part in a signal transduction pathway involved in the establishment of cell identity within each embryonic segment.\r"

Biopsies were performed before and at 3 and 6 months of treatment. The specimens were studied by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Six morphometric indices were evaluated. Danazol produced a progestational effect on endometrial glands and stroma associated with marked hypotrophy of the mucosa, and buserelin treatment resulted in weakly proliferative or inactive mucosa. Both drugs induced noncyclicity and hypotrophy of endometrium although with different mechanisms of action, and it is suggested that they may have similar effects on ectopic endometrium. Because the atrophic effect of danazol appeared earlier than that of buserelin, the former could be recommended for short-term therapy.\r"

Thirty-six patients (45.6%) did not have preterm labor; the daily monitoring resulted in an average loss to the insurance carrier of $3300 per patient, or $118,800. Forty-three patients (54.4%) experienced preterm labor and were found to have benefited from the monitoring system. Earlier detection of preterm labor and better management of oral tocolysis in this group resulted in earlier initiation of maternal tocolytic therapy, which ultimately decreased the preterm birth rate and hospitalization days in the neonatal intensive care unit. Cost analysis of this group demonstrated an average savings of $24,000 per patient, or an overall savings of $1,032,000. The total group of high-risk patients (79) resulted in a net savings to the insurance carrier of $913,200, or $11,500 per patient, suggesting that use of the ambulatory uterine activity monitoring system significantly reduced the cost associated with preterm labor and early delivery.\r"

Therefore, antibody responses to an H influenzae type b polysaccharide-Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein conjugate vaccine were measured in very young Gambian infants. In the first group (n = 85), to whom the vaccine was given at the ages of 1 and 3 months, the geometric mean antibody level rose from a prevaccination level of 0.23 microgram/mL to a postvaccination level of 1.27 micrograms/mL, and in the second group (n = 56), vaccinated at the ages of 2 and 4 months, the prevaccination level of 0.16 microgram/mL rose to a postvaccination level of 1.59 micrograms/mL. These two final postvaccination levels did not differ significantly, and interpolation suggests that similar antibody levels were present in both groups of infants at the age of 3 months. This is the age by which protection would need to be achieved to protect against H influenzae meningitis in The Gambia and in other countries where the infection has similar epidemiologic characteristics. No significant side effects of vaccination were noted.\r"

These included broadening strategies to include paid advertising, media advocacy, and other tactics beyond public service campaigns; increasing awareness within the public health sector of the media's perspective on health; working collaboratively with media professionals and organizations, including the minority media; and developing guidelines for public-private sector partnerships. These recommendations, and factors affecting the roles of the media and public health communities in informing the public about health, are described in this paper.

Focus groups conducted with members of the hard-to-reach American public showed that while being healthy seemed to be important to participants, and they were generally aware of what to do to stay healthy, they had a different operational definition of health than that used in health promotion programs. Participants seemed to believe that better health behaviors would build their resistance to acute illnesses, that is, keep them healthy, but that chronic diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, were due to fate and heredity and beyond their individual control. The focus group results show that participants had not made the link between chronic disease prevention and the importance of diet, exercise, and weight control. Although most of them seemed to express a genuine interest in \"doing better,\" they were not able to supply more than superficial examples of how such changes might be made. Surprisingly, there were more similarities than differences in participants' attitudes and beliefs, with the similarities cutting across boundaries of race-ethnicity, age, and sex. Interest in changing behaviors was only slightly more pronounced among female rather than male, and older rather than younger, participants. However, there was not much evidence from the participants that they were actively seeking health information or trying to reconcile conflicting knowledge and beliefs.\r"

The authors discuss alternative conceptualizations, which highlight the strengths of different audience segments and encourage innovative approaches to the communication process. These alternative conceptualizations emphasize interactive communication, a view of society in which individuals are seen as members of equivalent--albeit different--cultures, and a shift of responsibility for health problems from individuals to social systems.

  ".W": "A review of mass media response to the smoking issue over the past 25 years reveals that sustained involvement of the broadcast and print media has served significantly to heighten public awareness and reduce smoking rates in the total U.S. population. Public service advertising has been an integral part of the smoking control movement from its outset, but today's intensely competitive media environment has forced health promoters to look beyond public service announcements in the development of total communication programs. Media advocacy--using the media to sharpen public awareness and mold public policy to serve the public interest, a technique derived from political campaigns--is emerging as a powerful tool in the smoking control movement. Its emphasis is on changing the entire social context of tobacco use in America, rather than the smoking behavior of people. Because media advocates' success pivots on their access to the media, they must be able both to create news and to react quickly to breaking news and unexpected events. The opportunistic, risk-taking nature of media advocacy requires that most efforts be waged at the State and local levels. An increasing number of State health departments and other organizations are using paid advertising to improve the frequency and reach of nonsmoking messages. Research verifies that paid media campaigns increase the target audience's exposure to smoking control messages, but planning and making efficient media purchases require sophistication and, of course, the necessary funds. Irrefutable medical evidence linking smoking to disease and addiction, combined with the powerful social force of the nonsmokers' rights movement, offer hope that a smoke-free society is an achievable goal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors describe a model for two of the five programs and discuss the role of communication media in supporting national goals for education programs. The research basis for the programs is reviewed, together with the process by which the Institute develops information materials for mass media, notably public service announcements. A description of two national health education campaigns, hypertension and cholesterol, illustrates how market research is used to identify appropriate target audiences, develop messages, and select channels of communication. Lessons learned about the role of mass media in a national health education campaign are summarized.\r"

  ".W": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Although mammography is recognized as the most effective early detection method for breast cancer, it remains underutilized. Communications theory and practice, with its emphasis on formative research, can provide a basis for developing strategies effective in changing mammography-related behaviors. Formative research, an important component of communications planning, can offer information useful in developing suitable messages and materials. The National Cancer Institute conducted small group discussions with white and black women, ages 40 to 75, to explore their attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about mammography. Findings reinforced the results from quantitative surveys indicating that a perceived lack of their own need for the examination, lack of a physician referral, and procrastination were the main reasons that the women reported for not having mammograms. The discussions provided detailed information about the factors that can be used to guide development of messages and materials to promote mammography use. The results indicate that strategies for messages directed to either black or white women ages 40 years and older need to stress the same key message points. The points are that all women ages 40 and older are at risk for breast cancer; breast cancer can be treated successfully if it is detected early enough; mammography can detect breast cancer before a lump can be felt by a woman or her physician; women need to follow screening guidelines for age and frequency for screening; and mammography is a low-risk, quick, and painless procedure. Communication channels to reach women should include television, newspapers, magazines, and information available in physicians' offices.\r"

Local officials worked with the Public Health Service's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to educate and inform the public about the workshop recommendations as well as other alcohol-related concerns, and to encourage public involvement in their communities with the issue of alcohol-impaired driving and other alcohol-related concerns. With minimal assistance from Federal agencies and Washington-based health and public interest groups, the communities developed unique approaches to generating local television, radio, and newspaper coverage of an event that had originated as national news. The events demonstrated that, with minimal Federal resources and support, local groups can create media attention in conjunction with national news, and local media events can lead to successful community activism. The techniques can be applied by other community groups to gain sufficient news media attention to encourage the public to organize around issues of common concern.\r"

Situational and financial barriers to care were not important correlates of utilization. In unadjusted analyses, only insurance status and employment status were associated with utilization. Of the sociodemographic characteristics studied, only parity was strongly associated with the use of prenatal care. When the apparent associations between utilization and insurance status and utilization and employment were analyzed controlling for parity, the estimated strength and statistical significance of these relationships diminished considerably. Multiparous women who were more likely than primiparous women to be underutilizers were also more likely to be on medical assistance and to be unemployed. These findings suggest that situational and financial barriers are not important correlates of utilization for low-income, adult women living in urban areas where there are accessible clinic facilities and public transportation. Efforts to identify and surmount other kinds of barriers may prove to be a more effective approach to prenatal outreach for women in these circumstances.\r"

Noteworthy improvements in the completeness of reporting emerged during this period with a decline from 31.1 percent missing information in 1974 to 6.6 percent missing in 1985. Completeness of reporting and strategies for imputing values for missing data were analyzed for their impact on the calculation of the percentage of preterm live births. The results indicate that the underreporting of gestational age can lead to marked underestimation of the preterm percentage in a population and to misinterpretation of trends in these percentages. Based on the results of this analysis, it is recommended that preterm percentages be based on cases with DLNM gestational age values between 20 and 50 weeks. Since cases with missing or implausible gestational age data have a greater risk of a poor pregnancy outcome, these findings emphasize the importance of identifying both the completeness of data reporting and the use of imputation and deletion strategies when employing population-based DLNM data to calculate gestational age related indicators.\r"

Statewide information on deaths was obtained from death certificates, autopsy reports, and investigative reports. Information about morbidity was obtained from the Florida Hospital Cost Containment Board data base and the National Climatic Data Center data base for all Florida counties, as well as from hospitals in selected counties. Lightning-related deaths totaled 101 in Florida during the period 1978-87, an annual average of 10.1. Eight percent of the victims were from other States. The overall yearly death rate for State residents was 0.09 per 100,000 population, with the highest rate being that for men aged 15-19 years, 0.38 per 100,000. Thirteen percent of victims were females. The ratio of lightning-related injuries to deaths in Florida was estimated at about four to one. Thirty percent of all deaths were occupationally related. The first strikes of lightning from a thunderstorm may be the most dangerous, not in terms of impact, but because of the element of surprise. During thunderstorms, people may seek shelter under isolated trees because they believe erroneously that a tree offers protection from lightning, or perhaps because their top priority is to escape from rain rather than lightning. People may not seek adequate shelter during thunderstorms because they do not know the dangers of remaining outdoors or their judgment is impaired by drugs or alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied total mortality in Allegheny County, PA, during the summer of 1988. A heat wave occurred in July of 1988, with daily maximum temperatures near or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit on 15 consecutive days. During that period there were a total of 694 deaths from all causes in the county, compared with an expected 587 deaths (P less than .01). All 107 excess deaths were of persons ages 65 or older, with the majority (78) occurring to persons older than age 75. Daily mortality was most closely correlated with average temperature from the previous day (R = .49, P less than .01), suggesting the cumulative effects of successive high daytime and night-time temperatures on susceptible persons. Evaluation of a possible effect on mortality of high ambient ozone levels detected in early July suggested that ozone did not contribute to excess mortality during the heat wave. Comparison of the 1988 heat wave with a less intense hot spell of 1973 indicated that excess mortality was less than would have been expected in 1988. The authors speculate that increased public awareness and the wider use of air conditioning over the years may have reduced the lethality of periods of extreme summer temperatures in urban areas. Further research is needed to evaluate this hypothesis completely. Public health officials should continue to monitor weather forecasts for predictions of extended periods of unusual heat and should warn the public to take suitable precautions during such periods.\r"

More blacks than whites were found to be smokers, before and after adjusting for age and education differences. More whites than blacks were former smokers, but the prevalence of those who had never smoked was comparable for whites and blacks. Among smokers, the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was lower among blacks than whites, but more blacks were found to smoke cigarettes with high \"tar\" (dry particulate matter) and nicotine content. Men smokers were found to smoke more than women smokers, young people smoked more than older people, and those with a high school education or less smoked more than those with more than a high school education. Smoking cessation behavior consisted mostly of a variety of strategies that began with reducing cigarette consumption, followed by changing to lower tar brands, attempting to quit, and actually quitting. In general, a higher percentage of whites than blacks reported smoking cessation behaviors. A greater percentage of white than black women had tried cigarette brands lower in tar and nicotine within the previous year. Among men, a lower percentage of black than white smokers had tried quitting, and fewer black men planned to quit in the future. Blacks appeared to lag behind whites in their efforts to quit smoking. Smoking behavior continues to be problematic for both blacks and whites. Studies are needed to explain better the racial differences in smoking and smoking cessation behaviors, and to facilitate programs to encourage cessation.\r"

The CBDMP is an active surveillance system; the staff visit hospitals to identify children with birth defects diagnosed in the first year of life. The study population comprised 66,481 live births to residents of five counties in the San Francisco Bay area in 1983. Of these infants, 2,543 had at least one birth defect noted on the DI, and 1,623 were in the CBDMP registry; 1,020 with defects noted on the DI were also in the CBDMP registry. For this same population, 399 infants had one or more defects noted on the birth certificate; 304 of these were also in the CBDMP registry. Reporting of birth defects on the birth certificate was poor for every condition. Reporting on the DI was most reliable for oral clefts and chromosomal defects; for these defects, the DI omitted one-third of the cases but had identified only about 10 percent false-positive (that is, unverified) cases. Major central nervous system malformations were less well reported, with about one-third of them false-positive. For all other birth defects, the DI either omitted more than half of the cases, or more than half of the cases reported were false-positive cases. These findings raise questions about the validity of analytic studies of birth defects if the data are obtained only from the DI or the birth certificate.\r"

Based on Mantoux testing and measurement of anti-HIV-1, we found a positive but not significant association between HIV-1 and TB infection (odds ratio 2.4, 95 percent confidence interval 0.9-6.3). The power of the study to detect an association of this magnitude was 0.57. Of the entire intake sample, 1.3 percent were found to be coinfected with TB and HIV-1. Some misclassification may have been present due to anergy or latent HIV-1 infection. The elevated risk of TB in coinfected inmates, coupled with the study results, suggest that the inmate screening process on entry to the prison should be modified to improve identification of coinfected people. Specifically, anergy testing should be added to the admission screening procedure, and appropriate voluntary anonymous HIV-1 antibody testing should be more widely available to inmates.\r"

More than 66 percent of those screened needed either immunization other than for influenza, or an immunologic test, a decline from 72 percent noted during a 1984-85 influenza immunization program. The mean number of interventions was 2.00 per patient in the 1985-86 program and 2.26 during the previous program. Of patients screened in the period 1985-86, 20.5 percent received diphtheria-tetanus toxoids, 15.7 percent received pneumococcal vaccine, and 23.1 percent received a tuberculin skin test. Vaccination or titers for measles were ordered for 10.4 percent, for rubella for 10.9 percent, and for hepatitis B for 20.3 percent. Assessment of those who came to the clinic for influenza vaccination in the second program demonstrated that the needs of some patients had been met in the first program. However, a general lack of immune protection existed in the majority of patients screened in the second program. In both programs, those older than 59 years needed pneumococcal vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus toxoids more frequently than the general population. The means of the numbers of interventions and the percentages of patients needing intervention other than influenza vaccine declined from the first program to the second, suggesting progress in meeting some individual immunization needs in a large and changing ambulatory population.\r"

Results of this study indicate that the children receive their immunizations at times which are significantly later than the recommended schedule. The first, second, third, and fourth oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) doses are being given approximately 10, 15, 23, and 32 months late, respectively. Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccine (DPT) is likewise late with the first, second, third, and fourth doses occurring 9, 14, 20, and 26 months late. The fifth booster dose in both series was timed properly. The mumps, measles, rubella vaccine (MMR) is approximately 28 months late, on average. An evaluation of antibody status of 41 migrant farm worker children (5-10 years old) revealed that, even with aberrant patterns of administration, all children had adequate antibody titers. These data indicate that, although adequate levels of protection are reached with the pattern of immunization that migrant farm worker children have, there are large groups of children that are unprotected early in life when they are most susceptible to these diseases.\r"

Three days later she had a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) embolus with infarcted bowel. Her small bowel was resected leaving about 20-25 centimeters of small bowel. A cardiac echo on hospital day 6 documented the presence of a left ventricular embolus, which was considered to be the cause of her CVA and SMA embolus. The cardiologists recommended lifelong anticoagulation, preferably with warfarin when technically feasible. After one month of warfarin therapy, with doses as high as 25 mg/d, the patient's prothrombin times (PTs) were not changed from baseline; however, this was probably due to concomitant therapy with vitamin K. Heparin was incorporated into her total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in preparation for her discharge. Because the TPN was cycled, she required subcutaneous heparin twice daily while off TPN. This patient's clinical course while she was maintained on heparin therapy was complicated by bleeding episodes and extensive thigh and abdominal hematomas, which led to erratic heparin absorption and widely fluctuating partial thromboplastin times. Ten months after the initiation of anticoagulation the patient was again tried on an oral warfarin regimen. She was successfully titrated to achieve the desired PT ratio. This case led to a review of the literature of patients with short-bowel syndrome requiring anticoagulation.\r"

Today, the emphasis on cost containment has added an extra dimension: cost-effective therapeutic regimens. Most stages of the DUP have not been extensively studied. Evidence presented to date reflects duplication of efforts and suboptimal decisions, with little concerted effort to identify means for improvements that may have a favorable impact on cost and patient outcome. The increasing use of drugs as the primary mode to treat diseases, the reduction in the number of hospital employees at a time increased severity of patient illness, the nursing shortage, and the increasing cost and complexity of drugs, along with the inconsistencies that exist in drug use, demonstrate a need for a complete review of the DUP. The DUP, as it currently operates, is not conducive to the provision of a systematic approach to therapy. The stages in this process are often independent of each other and poorly performed by a variety of health professionals. The subsequent development of strategies for improving the chance for optimal drug therapy through the use of pharmacists as drug therapy experts is needed. The pharmacy profession is in a prime position where expanded patient care services and supervision of the entire DUP may actually decrease the total cost of health care. This expansion represents the key to increasing acceptance of pharmacists' clinical role and for ensuring long-term survival of the profession.\r"

Fifty-one consecutive patients with AMI were randomized to treatment with xamoterol, 200 mg twice a day, or placebo; patients were also stratified as to whether or not diuretic therapy was given for left ventricular dysfunction. Noradrenaline, plasma renin activity (PRA), and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were measured over a 10-day period. Noradrenaline concentrations are higher (p less than 0.05) in patients treated with diuretics at the time of admission and fell over the subsequent 10 days (p less than 0.01). Treatment with xamoterol did not affect this noradrenaline response to myocardial infarction. PRA was also significantly higher in the patients treated with diuretics, and there was a nonsignificant trend for xamoterol to blunt the PRA response in these patients. There was no difference in ANF levels between those patients who were treated with diuretics and those who were not; xamoterol did not affect ANF. Thus xamoterol does not further elevate noradrenaline levels as do conventional beta blockers, and it does not activate the renin-angiotensin system as do potent nonselective beta agonists. Furthermore, xamoterol does not increase ANF levels, probably because it is not negatively inotropic. We conclude that xamoterol does not cause deleterious neuroendocrine changes in patients with AMI even in those treated for heart failure.\r"

All patients (n = 20) had chronic stable angina with symptomatic and silent events. All patients had 3 episodes of angina/week and 3 episodes of ischemia/24 hr. The protocol was made up of 2 weeks of placebo followed by 2 weeks of active drug, then crossed over for 2 weeks of placebo followed by the other active drug. At the end of each 2-week period, patients had ambulatory monitoring and exercise treadmill testing. All ambulatory monitoring reports were read blind and entered into an independent data base. The results were the following: on transdermal nitroglycerin, the duration of ischemia decreased by 57% from 140 min/24 hr to 60 min/24 hr (p = 0.0054). The exercise time increased by 5.5% from 4.8 to 5.0 minutes (p = 0.16). With nifedipine, the duration of ischemia decreased by 22% from 175 min/24 hr to 137 min/24 hr (p = 0.16). The exercise tolerance time increased by 13% from 4.5 to 5.0 minutes (p = 0.0264). Nifedipine increased exercise time without altering total ischemic time, while transdermal nitroglycerin decreased total ischemic time without increasing exercise time. Thus, changes in exercise time do not necessarily predict changes in total ischemic time.\r"

During a 19-month period blood cultures from 140 AIDS patients were sent to the microbiology laboratory. After the cultures were incubated for seven days, aliquots of medium from the vials were centrifuged, sediments examined microscopically for mycobacteria, and cultured to mycobacterial media. Seventy-one AIDS patients (51%) had at least one blood culture positive for mycobacteria. There was a significant difference in the percent of female AIDS patients positive for mycobacteria compared to male patients (72% vs. 44%, P less than 0.01). Forty-four percent of all subsequently positive cultures were detected by an acid fast stain of the specimen sediment. Subcultures from the BACTEC 6A suspensions were positive on mycobacterial media at one-seven weeks (mean three weeks) after planting. Sixty-nine of the isolates were Mycobacterium avium complex, while two were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Some bacteremias with M. tuberculosis may have been undetected because growth experiments with a reference strain showed that, in contrast to M. avium complex, M. tuberculosis did not increase in concentration in 6A medium.\r"

For each intervention, the costs and clinical outcomes associated with that strategy must be compared with an alternate strategy for treating the same patients. If an intervention results in improved outcomes but also costs more, the incremental cost per incremental unit of clinical outcome should be calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for various programs can be ranked to set funding priorities. By using this list, the person responsible for allocating resources can maximize the net health benefit for a target population derived from a fixed budget. Clinicians may not share this objective because, individually, they are appropriately concerned solely with the effectiveness of a specific intervention for their patients and are not concerned with the benefit derived from spending those resources on other patients in the target population. In addition, allocation may be driven by distributional and political objectives. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates the consequences of allocation decisions. Because clinicians should participate in policy making, they must understand d the role of this technique in setting funding priorities.\r"

We found polyclonal serum IgM anti-GM1 antibodies by an anti-GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 9 (19%) of 48 patients with motor neuron disease. A comparable frequency of IgM anti-GM1 antibodies was found in 4 (10%) of 40 sera from patients with other neurological disease. Three (17%) of 18 sera from the patients with motor neuron disease and 2 (17%) of 12 sera from patients with other neurological diseases had anti-GM1 immunostaining as shown by thin layer chromatography immunoblot. One patient with a lower motor neuron variant of motor neuron disease or motor axonopathy without multifocal conduction block had a markedly elevated polyclonal IgM anti-GM1 ELISA titer (greater than 1:64,000) with prominent immunostaining of GM1, moderate immunostaining of GM2, and weak and inconsistent immunostaining of GD1b by thin layer chromatography immunoblot. Treatment with prednisone resulted in clinical improvement despite increasing anti-GM1 antibody titers. These data indicate that patients with motor neuron disease have measurable levels of anti-ganglioside antibodies as frequently as patients with other neurological diseases. This contrasts with a small subgroup of patients with a lower motor neuron variant of motor neuron disease or motor axonopathy who have markedly elevated levels of serum anti-ganglioside antibodies and a clinical syndrome that is treatable with immunosuppression.\r"

Conversely, the CD4+CD8+ cells were significantly decreased. Significant increases in CD1-CD3+ cells and significant decreases in CD1+CD3- cells were noted. The percentage of CD45R+ cells also increased. There were no increases in activated T lymphocytes, defined as CD4+DR+ cells, CD8+DR+ cells, or IL2R+ cells. We conclude that the proportion of T lineage lymphocytes that are differentiated is increased in the thymus of patients with myasthenia gravis, and could reflect accelerated differentiation.\r"

(i) The rates of carbapenem (imipenem and meropenem) diffusion through the protein D2 pore were roughly 2 to 70 times higher than those through other porin pores. It is not clear why the protein D2 pore allowed rapid diffusion of carbapenems. The rates of diffusion of glucosamine and triglycine through the protein D2 pore were about 14 and 4 times higher, respectively, than that of an uncharged test solute with a similar Mr, glucose. (ii) The rates of diffusion of antipseudomonal anionic beta-lactams such as piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, and aztreonam through the protein C pore were higher than those through other porin pores. This was probably due to the slightly larger pore size and the slight anion selectivity of protein C, since the apparent exclusion limit of the protein C pore for uncharged saccharides is higher than that of other porins and the rate of diffusion of gluconic acid through the protein C pore is about double that for glucose. (iii) The rates of diffusion of cefoperazone through all three species of porin were relatively high. These results indicate that the antipseudomonal beta-lactams permeate the P. aeruginosa outer membrane via newly identified porins.\r"

The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.\r"

The broth-determined MICs of this agent ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml for M. tuberculosis strains and from 0.25 to 8.0 micrograms/ml for M. avium strains. A distinctive feature of this agent, in comparison with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, is its substantially greater activity at the low pHs. For M. avium strains, the MICs of Win 57273 were 2.0 micrograms/ml or less for 54.5% of strains at pH 6.8 and 85.5% of strains at pH 5.0. Win 57273 was more active than ciprofloxacin against M. avium strains, and this difference was very substantial for all M. avium strains at pH 5.0. Taking into account that the predominant locations of these organisms in vivo are within the phagosomes and phagolysosomes of macrophages, i.e., in acidic environments at pH 5.0 or lower, the greater activity of Win 57273 at low pH makes this quinolone especially promising for M. avium infection. The bactericidal activity of Win 57273 for M. avium strains was the same as that of ciprofloxacin, with MBCs from 4.0 to 16.0 micrograms/ml.\r"

Results obtained with inhibitors and a mutant that had defective autolytic enzymes suggested that cell lysis resulted from the deregulation of autolysin activity. The addition of surfactants at sublytic concentrations produced twisted cells, filamented cells, or both. Autolysins extracted with 5 M LiCl from the cell wall fraction and lysozyme added to cells that were treated with surfactants restored the apparently normal cell rod morphology, suggesting that surfactants interfere with the role of autolysins in normal construction of the cell envelope. The rates of cellular autolysis and autolysin activity remaining in growing cells after exposure to a surfactant at a sublytic concentration decreased, although the rate of turnover of cell wall peptidoglycan was the same as that of control cells. Surfactants were suggested to interact with the regulatory system of autolysins and, thus, to affect the activities of autolysins in B. subtilis cells and to cause either morphological changes or cell autolysis, depending on the concentration of surfactants.\r"

B. subtilis cells possessing BIPs were able to duplicate at a normal rate in the presence of bacitracin. The amount of B. subtilis BIPs diminished markedly after a few divisions in the absence of the antibiotic and the organism simultaneously reverted to the susceptible state. Induction of the proteins did not take place after the fourth or fifth hour of the stationary phase. The B. thuringiensis BIP was also induced by vancomycin.

In Zambia, 52% of N. gonorrhoeae isolates produced beta-lactamase in 1986. Few oral regimens have proven effective for treatment of resistant N. gonorrhoeae. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 250 mg of ciprofloxacin given orally versus 250 mg of ceftriaxone given intramuscularly for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in adult males. Two hundred men were enrolled and treated. The two groups were comparable in age (27.5 years), prevalence of latent syphilis (14 and 10%), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (32 and 38%). Of 165 patients with cultures positive for N. gonorrhoeae who returned for follow-up, ciprofloxacin cured 83 of 83 (100%), including 26 with penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and 21 with N. gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance to multiple antibiotics (CMRNG), and ceftriaxone cured 81 of 82 (98.7%), including 30 with PPNG and 19 with CMRNG. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Chlamydia trachomatis in urethral exudate was found by direct fluorescent-antibody microscopic examination or by culture in 10 (5%) participants. All N. gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by ceftriaxone at 0.06 micrograms/ml, except one which was inhibited at 0.125 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin inhibited all isolates at 0.03 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective therapy for uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, including that caused by PPNG and CMRNG in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men.\r"

The present study examined the efficacy of teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive bacterial infections in various animal models, in the treatment of experimental endocarditis due to a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Enterococcus faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin. Vancomycin was used as a comparative antibiotic. In the first set of experiments, both antimicrobial agents were administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days at dosages which yielded comparable mean levels in serum (plus or minus the standard deviation) of 14.6 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin and 14.3 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. These regimens proved similarly effective in sterilizing cardiac vegetations (38 versus 50% of treated animals, respectively; P greater than 0.05). Mean (plus or minus the standard deviation) residual bacterial titers within vegetations were reduced to 3.2 +/- 1.2 log10 CFU/g and 3.4 +/- 1.7 log10 CFU/g, respectively. In separate experiments, the potential of teicoplanin to cure endocarditis was assessed, using two dosage regimens: (i) 30 mg/kg per day (mean level in serum, 13 micrograms/ml) for 10 days or (ii) 150 mg/kg per day (mean level in serum, 84 micrograms/ml) for 5 days.

Blood samples (n = 10) and total urine output were collected during a 24-h dosing interval. Fleroxacin concentrations in serum and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The maximum concentration in serum and the time to achieve that maximum were 6.2 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml and 0.94 +/- 0.62 h, respectively. The absorption half-life, alpha half-life, beta half-life, apparent steady-state volume of distribution, apparent total body clearance, and renal clearance were 0.56 +/- 0.37 h, 0.78 +/- 0.51 h, 10.56 +/- 1.40 h, 0.85 +/- 0.31 liters/kg, 129.2 +/- 19.6 ml/min, and 53.3 +/- 16.7 ml/min, respectively. Fleroxacin disposition in this patient population was similar to that in noninfected volunteers with normal renal function.\r"

A surprisingly large percentage of manic patients showed difficulty in post-hospital adjustment, and over 40% experienced a manic syndrome during the follow-up period. Manic patients showed poorer outcomes than did unipolar depressives. Manic patients taking lithium carbonate did not show better outcome than those not taking lithium carbonate. The results suggest (1) many hospitalized manic patients have a severe, recurrent, and pernicious disorder; and (2) in routine clinical practice, lithium carbonate treatment is an effective prophylaxis for fewer than the 70% to 80% of manic patients previously reported.\r"

The VEP configuration was normal in all patients at the onset of the investigation. Hypoxic episodes (PaO2 less than 3 kPa) caused rapid and consistent attenuation of the VEP mostly with an instantaneous recovery after normalization of PaO2. In contrast, VEP amplitude and latency were unaffected during episodes with low cerebral blood flow (4.5 ml/100 gm/min) and correspondingly low oxygen delivery to the brain (1 ml/100 gm/min), severe hypocapnia (PaCO2 1.6 kPa), and severe arterial hypotension (MABP 10 mm Hg), provided that the arterial oxygen tension was greater than 5 kPa. Absence of N1 was observed soon after the development of severe intracranial hemorrhage; however, this abnormality was short in duration. We conclude that the neurons generating VEPs are supported sufficiently during extreme physiologic episodes, except during severe hypoxia. The recovery time may be proportional to the cerebral insult.\r"

The results demonstrate that ELISA and Western blot assay have limitations for HTLV-I antibody detection in an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) nonendemic population. This conclusion is based on the many false reactives obtained by ELISA, and weak and indeterminate reaction (mostly p19 band) on Western blotting. All moderate to strongly HTLV-I ELISA-positive samples tested were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. Although 6/27 mycosis fungoides (MF) patients tested gave mostly a weak reaction on HTLV-I ELISA, 3/6 MF patients gave multiple bands (p19, p31, p36, gp46) on Western blotting and three samples from one patient gave the same p31, p36, and gp46 bands. This may suggest involvement of some HTLV-I-related virus in MF. These results also indicate that prevalence of HTLV-I infection in leukemia/lymphoma patients was rare, if it exists at all, since, despite the reactivity of some sera with HTLV-I-suspected antigens, none of the samples satisfy the USPHS criteria for positivity which is based on the detection of antibodies to gag protein p24 and to an env gene product gp46 or gp61/68.\r"

Proliferative responses to env were seen in 9% of control children compared with 27% of infected children (p less than 0.02). There was no difference in the response rates of seropositive and seronegative adults (17% and 16%, respectively). Proliferative responses to cor were seen more frequently in children and adults (22% and 28%, respectively) than their seronegative cohorts (11% and 12%, respectively). Also, the proliferative response to env and cor was seen in 27% and 37%, respectively, of seronegative children who were born to seropositive mothers and then subsequently seroreverted. These results suggest that sensitization to HIV recombinant antigens has resulted in a cell-mediated immune response in some HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, the significant cell-mediated immune response to these antigens in seroreverting children raises the possibility that they may have been sensitized to this antigen by previous HIV infection.\r"

In the presence of 25 nM AZT, 2.0 micrograms/ml of PPS reduced HIV-1 replication 110-fold, compared with a 3.9- and 7-fold decrease in the presence of either drug individually. Surprisingly, at low (below 1 microgram/ml) concentrations of either PPS or dextran sulfate, an enhancement of virus production was observed. PPS was nontoxic, had a proliferative effect on uninfected and a protective effect on infected PMNC. Virus enhancement at low concentrations of PPS appeared to be linked to its lymphoproliferative effect. These findings suggest that the use of PPS and others such agents as monotherapy for AIDS might have deleterious effects. However, due to its marked synergism with AZT and its lymphoproliferative activities, PPS might prove to be a useful agent in therapeutic trials of AIDS if used in combination with less than the usual dosage of AZT.\r"

In 30 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and ten consecutive patients with aortic valve replacement (AVR), in whom therapy with catecholamines was expected to be necessary during and after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the basis of a retrospective study (\"control\" patients), 1.0 mg/kg of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor enoximone was administered ten minutes prior to weaning from bypass (enoximone group). In eight CABG and four AVR patients weaning was possible without further pharmacologic support. Significantly less epinephrine was used in enoximone pretreated patients (8.8 +/- 3.0 micrograms/min) than in the control patients (21.4 +/- 4.4 micrograms/kg). The use of additional vasodilators was significantly less pronounced in these patients as well. Seven CABG and four AVR patients in the enoximone group needed additional vasoconstrictors (norepinephrine) to counteract marked, unwanted decrease in peripheral vascular resistance with a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Hemodynamic monitoring revealed a higher level in heart rate in the control patients with arrhythmia in seven of the CABG patients: MAP, right atrial pressure, cardiac index, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were without significant differences between the groups. Pulmonary artery pressure and TSR, however, increased more in the control group, indicating an increase in right and left ventricular afterload. The results of this study demonstrate that patients at risk of circulatory failure during or after weaning from CPB profit from pretreatment with PDE-III inhibitor enoximone due to a reduction in catecholamines and an improvement in hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM), in the purest sense, is the result of depleted body protein stores due to semistarvation. A review of the hormonal response to simple semistarvation illustrates the elegant adaptive ability of the body to respond to an inadequate diet. By contrast, the body's metabolic response to an injury or illness stimulus is a dynamic process orchestrated by monokines and hormones. Although the injury response, strictly speaking, is not synonymous with PCM, the resultant increased energy expenditure, anorexia, and potential for skeletal muscle breakdown can result in an even more rapid depletion of body protein stores. Ultimately, the need for nutritional support depends on the amount of recent weight loss, anticipated time of insufficient oral intake, and the degree of stress. A discussion of basic concepts of anthropometry precedes examples of advantages and disadvantages of a given anthropometric parameter for selected disease states. The effects of PCM on visceral structure and function are discussed in detail so that the reader can appreciate why the metabolic response to injury may have a very different impact on the nourished compared with the malnourished patient. Particular attention is paid to the adverse effects of PCM on immune function and its antithesis, the beneficial impact of nutritional repletion on the immune system. An approach to refeeding discusses indications for initiation of nutritional support, choice of route, design of a macronutrient and micronutrient regimen, and guidelines for monitoring. Familiarity with the metabolic alterations of refeeding is key to the mitigation of potentially life-threatening complications of sudden refeeding. Appreciation of the anticipated response to nutrition is important, as the response will vary with the degree of stress. A nearly optimal response can be expected with appropriate nutrition in the nonstressed semistarved patient, whereas inefficient repletion is to be expected in the severely stressed patient. The review concludes with a discussion of the role of nutrition as a modifier of the body's metabolic response to injury.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the changes in thyroid hormone economy that occur in normal pregnant rats between 17-22 days of gestation. T4 and T3 decreased in all extrathyroidal tissues studied, namely plasma, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and skeletal muscle. The exception is the concentration of T3 in cerebral cortex, which remains unchanged, possibly as a consequence of an increase in type II 5'-iodothyronine deiodinase activity. The marked decrease observed in most T4 and T3 pools was not accompanied by a commensurate increase in circulating TSH levels, which at 21 days gestation were either unchanged or actually decreased. The TSH response to TRH appeared to be prolonged. alpha-Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was decreased in the liver, in accordance with its thyroid hormone deficiency. Hepatic type I 5'-iodothyronine deiodinase activity, however, did not decrease, but was slightly increased. Thus, thyroid hormone economy in the pregnant rat near term shows striking similarities with several (but not all) of the changes described in patients with nonthyroidal illness and in several animal models used to study this condition. It is suggested that attenuation of the negative feedback response to the decrease in thyroid hormone pools, leading to low levels of thyroid hormones in most tissues, is the normal physiological response to situations where preservation of energy (and protein) represents a distinct adaptive advantage, as in the case of the pregnant rat and her conceptus.\r"

  ".U": "90298840\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a monokine produced by activated macrophages and monocytes, may be an essential mediator of the pathogenesis and of the hormonal response to endotoxic shock. It has been suggested that an elevated level of TNF alpha is a marker for morbidity and mortality during septic shock, and that treatment with antibodies against TNF alpha decreases mortality. Because monokines have been shown to interact at the hypothalamic-pituitary level, we have studied the effect of TNF alpha on basal and stimulated hormone release from normal rat anterior pituitary cells. After 3 days of incubation, primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells were stimulated with either 0.5 ng/ml CRF, 3 ng/ml AVP, 10 ng/ml angiotensin II (AII), 10(-6) M TRF, 10(-8) M LHRH, or 10(-8) M GHRH, alone or in the presence of 20 or 50 ng/ml human or murine recombinant TNF alpha. The culture media were analyzed for ACTH, GH, LH, and PRL content. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated 3 to 8 times. Time-course experiments (n = 3) demonstrated that TNF alpha inhibited CRF-stimulated ACTH production over a period of 8, 16, and 24 h, but had no effect before a period of 4 h. At doses ranging from 1 to 100 ng/ml, TNF alpha did not affect basal ACTH secretion but inhibited CRF-stimulated ACTH release in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 approximately 10 ng/ml). At a dose of 50 ng/ml, TNF alpha inhibited AVP-stimulated ACTH release by 30% and blocked the effect of AII. TNF alpha (20 and 50 ng/ml) completely prevented the CRF-AVP potentiation of ACTH release. Similarly, TNF alpha inhibited the stimulated release of GH (100% inhibition), LH (35% inhibition), and PRL (100% inhibition). TNF alpha had no effect on the basal secretion of GH or LH but inhibited basal PRL in a dose-dependent manner. The administration of the monokine did not cause any cellular damage because 48 h after removal of the TNF alpha treatment the cells showed normal basal and stimulated hormone levels in response to their specific stimuli. Incubation of TNF alpha solutions with antibody to TNF alpha reversed all TNF alpha actions. These data suggest that TNF alpha inhibits the secretion of pituitary hormones and particularly suppresses the response of the corticotroph cells. This inhibitory effect may contribute to the increased mortality observed in cases of severe septic shock with high circulating TNF alpha levels.\r"

The stimulation of insulin release could not be ascribed to an increase in oxygen uptake, to the generation of histamine from L-histidine, or to its participation in a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction. Like other cationic amino acids, however, L-histidine rapidly accumulated in islet cells, increased 86Rb outflow from prelabeled islets perifused in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, and stimulated the entry of Ca2+ into islet cells. Yet, the amount of exogenous L-histidine present in the islet cells with a positively charged side chain was estimated to be below the threshold value required for stimulation of insulin release by fully ionized cationic amino acids, such as L-arginine. Hence, the present findings argue against the view that the insulinotropic action of cationic amino acids is solely attributable to the accumulation of these positively charged molecules inside the islet B cell with subsequent depolarization of the plasma membrane.\r"

  ".U": "90298843\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelin, a hormone secreted by endothelial cells, has potent vasoconstrictive properties. Due to its potential paracrine nature, we examined the effect of endothelin-I on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion in vitro. Isolated superfused rat left atria, paced at 2 Hz, were used for study. Endothelin (1-100 nM) increased ANP secretion in a dose-dependent manner from 1.6- to 6.7-fold above baseline. Spontaneously beating right atria increased ANP secretion by 2.3-fold in response to 10 nM endothelin without a change in beat frequency. However, the right atrial ANP secretory response was less than the 3.8-fold increase seen by left atria, and the time to peak response was slower. The calcium dependency of endothelin-stimulated ANP secretion was examined using paced left atria. The dependency of endothelin-stimulated secretion on calcium influx was examined by lowering the superfusate calcium from 1.8 to 0.2 mM. The ANP secretory response to 10 nM endothelin was reduced by 65% with 0.2 mM calcium. Influx of calcium through voltage-dependent calcium channels was examined by superfusion with 50 microM nitrendipine. Nitrendipine decreased endothelin-stimulated ANP secretion by 51% without affecting endothelin binding. The role of intracellular calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was examined by superfusion with 1 microM ryanodine, an inhibitor of SR calcium release. Ryanodine had no effect on endothelin-stimulated ANP secretion. We conclude: 1) Endothelin is a potent stimulus of ANP secretion in vitro. 2) The relative secretory response of right atria to endothelin expressed as a function of basal secretion is less and the time to peak secretion delayed relative to left atria. 3) Enhanced calcium influx, primarily through voltage-dependent calcium channels, plays a significant role in endothelin-stimulated secretion. 4) Release of intracellular calcium from the SR does not participate in the secretory response. 5) Part of the stimulatory signal appears to be independent of calcium influx or intracellular calcium release. Thus, endothelin may be an important secretagogue or modulator of ANP secretion in vivo; however, its physiological role in regulating ANP secretion in vivo remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Two cell lines have been established from insulinomas obtained by targeted expression of the simian virus 40 T antigen gene in transgenic mice. These cell lines, designated MIN6 and MIN7, produce insulin and T antigen and have morphological characteristics of pancreatic beta cells. MIN6 cells exhibit glucose-inducible insulin secretion comparable with cultured normal mouse islet cells, whereas MIN7 cells do not. Both cell lines produce liver-type glucose transporter (GT) mRNA at high level. Brain-type GT mRNA is also present at considerable level in MIN7 cells, but is barely detectable in MIN6 cells, suggesting that exclusive expression of the liver-type GT is related to glucose-inducible insulin secretion. MIN6 cells do not express either major histocompatibility (MHC) class I or class II antigens on the cell surface. However, treatment with interferon-gamma induces high levels of MHC class I antigens, and a combination of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induces a MHC class II antigen on the cell surface. These results emphasize that the MIN6 cell line retains physiological characteristics of normal beta cells. The MIN6 cell line will be especially useful to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which beta cells regulate insulin secretion in response to extracellular glucose concentrations. We discuss a possible role of GT isoforms in glucose sensing by beta cells.\r"

  ".U": "90298851\r", 
  ".W": "GH produces an acute but transient insulin-like response in adipocytes that have been deprived of GH for at least 3 h. The insulin-like response is followed by a period of refractoriness during which a second insulin-like response to GH cannot be elicited. These studies were undertaken to evaluate the role of calcium in the insulin-like response and refractoriness. Methionyl human GH (hGH) (100 ng/ml) increased the incorporation of D-[3-3H] glucose into lipid by 50-100% in fat cells that preincubated for 3 h without hormone and usually by less than 10% in fat cells that were made refractory by exposure to 100 ng/ml of hGH in the first hour of incubation. Insulin (100 microU/ml) increased lipogenesis by 3-5-fold whether fat cells were sensitive or refractory to GH. To determine whether calcium plays a role in either the insulin-like response to GH or the refractory phenomenon, we examined the effects of trifluoroperazine (20 or 50 microM) and calmidazolium (1.0 microM) which block calmodulin, as well as verapamil (30 microM), which blocks calcium channels. These agents did not interfere with stimulation of incorporation of D-[3-3H]glucose into lipid by GH (100 ng/ml) or insulin (100 microU/ml) but restored sensitivity to the insulin-like effects of GH in otherwise refractory cells. When freshly isolated, and hence refractory, cells were incubated for 1 h in calcium-free medium that contained 0.5 mM EGTA, GH stimulated lipogenesis by 30% (P less than 0.001) even though the response to insulin was markedly decreased in the absence of calcium. Conversely, when added to sensitive cells in the presence of normal extracellular Ca2+ concentrations during the 4th h of incubation, the calcium ionophore, A23187 (1.0 microM) produced an apparent refractoriness to the insulin-like effect of GH but had no effect on the response to insulin. The data indicate that maintenance of refractoriness to the insulin-like action of GH depends upon a calcium-calmodulin-sensitive process and suggest that, in producing refractoriness, GH may increase availability of intracellular calcium perhaps by increasing the rate of calcium entry into adipocytes. Since changes in responsiveness to GH were not paralleled by changes in responsiveness to insulin, it is suggested that the calcium dependent process responsible for refractoriness must lie at an early step in the signaling pathway.\r"

In hypophysectornized (Hypox) rats, serum LH and FSH were both undetectable; in the rats that received TE implants, serum LH was undetectable, but FSH was unaffected compared to control values. Seminiferous tubule fluid testosterone concentrations were reduced significantly from their control values of 60-65 to 1.4-1.7 ng/ml in the azoospermic Hypox and TE rats. These rats then received testosterone-filled implants of 4, 12, 18, or 24 cm and were killed 2 months later. In both the Hypox and TE rats, seminiferous tubule fluid testosterone concentrations rose linearly with increasing capsule sizes, and with each of the implant sizes, these concentrations did not differ significantly between the Hypox and TE rats. This made it possible for the first time to examine the effects of comparable intratesticular testosterone concentrations on the numbers of advanced spermatids per testis that could be restored in the azoospermic testes of rats lacking all pituitary factors vs. those lacking only LH. The results that we present demonstrate that the numbers of restored advanced spermatids were consistently and significantly lower in Hypox than in TE rats despite equivalent seminiferous tubule fluid testosterone concentrations. These results provide quantitative conclusive evidence to support the contention that pituitary factors in addition to LH are required for the quantitative restoration of spermatogenesis in the adult rat testis.\r"

The effect of LIF relative to matched controls increased with decreasing serum concentration, reaching 30% inhibition at 0.2% serum. LIF also reduced the stimulatory effects of platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I on DNA synthesis. The inhibition of the DNA synthesis by saturating concentration of transforming growth factor beta was further enhanced by the addition of LIF, suggesting independent pathways for the action of the two growth inhibitors. In addition, LIF reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and the abundance of type I collagen messenger RNA, but increased the level of osteopontin messenger RNA. These findings suggest that LIF may play a role in regulating the function of osteoblasts.\r"

Calcitonin has been reported to inhibit or to stimulate PRL release from rat anterior pituitary cells. We have investigated the effects of salmon calcitonin on basal and stimulated PRL release from rat anterior pituitary cells and have studied the effects of this peptide on the intracellular biochemical pathways involved in PRL release. Salmon calcitonin had no significant effect on basal PRL release, but inhibited (P less than 0.01) TRH-stimulated PRL release without affecting PRL release promoted by angiotensin II, neurotensin, phorbol myristate acetate (a protein kinase C activator), or maitotoxin (a calcium channel activator). Salmon calcitonin had no effect on the increase in PRL release and intracellular cAMP concentration after exposure of pituitary cells to vasoactive intestinal peptide or forskolin. Salmon calcitonin significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) the TRH-stimulated rise in inositol phosphates without affecting the angiotensin II-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates. Similarly, salmon calcitonin decreased the TRH-stimulated increase in cytosolic calcium and arachidonate liberation by pituitary cells. We conclude that salmon calcitonin selectively decreases TRH-stimulated PRL release by a mechanism that involves a decrease in inositol phosphate production, as well as a subsequent reduction in cytosolic calcium levels and in arachidonate liberation.\r"

Specific binding, internalization, and degradation of ovine PRL (oPRL) were examined under a variety of experimental conditions to characterize the metabolism of receptor-bound hormone by these cells. Stationary-phase cells were incubated with [125I]oPRL in Fischer's medium containing horse serum. Cell suspensions were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were assayed to determine specific cell-associated radioactivity. Internalized ligand was measured by exposing the cells to an acidic buffer before centrifugation to dissociate hormone from plasma membrane receptors, and cell-surface ligand was calculated by subtracting internalized hormone from the total [125I]oPRL bound by the cells. Hormone degradation was assessed by measuring the radioactivity in an acid-soluble fraction prepared from the incubation medium. Endocytosis of [125I]oPRL was observed within 30 min at 37 C, and the internalized component accounted for approximately 50% of the bound hormone under steady-state conditions. Hormone degradation was detectable within 1 h at 37 C and continued at a relatively linear rate thereafter; by 4 h, 8% of the added [125I]oPRL was acid soluble. Chloroquine (0.2 mM), methylamine (20 mM) and monensin (20 microM) prevented [125I]oPRL degradation and elevated both cell-surface and intracellular hormone 2-fold during a 4-h incubation. Leupeptin (0.2 mM) decreased degradation by only 15% under the same conditions. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 20 nM), a comitogen for lactogen-stimulated Nb2 cells, increased cell-surface hormone by 20% and decreased intracellular hormone by a corresponding amount 1 h after administration. Calcium ionophore A23187 (1 microM) produced similar changes, and a synergistic effect was noted when cells were exposed to both agents for 4 h. Amiloride (125 microM), an inhibitor of Nb2 cell mitogenesis, decreased [125I]oPRL degradation by 25% during a 4-h incubation. This response was abolished when the cells were exposed simultaneously to PMA. These experiments demonstrate that receptor-bound oPRL is rapidly internalized and extensively degraded via the endosome-lysosome pathway when Nb2 cells are maintained at 37 C. The inhibitory effect of PMA on oPRL internalization may help to explain the comitogenic action of this phorbol on Nb2 cells. Since amiloride also produced major changes in oPRL metabolism, post-binding events in lactogen processing by target cells could play an important role in the mitogenic response elicited by such hormones.\r"

Pituitary cells from immature male rats were cultured in chemically defined medium. After 4 days of static culture in the absence of inhibin preparation and GnRH, the cell monolayers were superfused for approximately 10 h at a constant speed (0.15 or 0.25 ml/min) with medium with or without inhibin preparation (1 micrograms/ml). During the superfusion, some cultures were stimulated with GnRH (10 nM) continuously or intermittently (1 min/0.5 h or 6 min/1 h). In the basal condition (no GnRH), inhibin suppressed FSH release after 5 h of exposure (P less than 0.01), whereas LH secretion was not affected. In cultures treated with GnRH pulses (of either frequency), the inhibitory effects on the GnRH-stimulated FSH and LH release were statistically significant (P less than 0.01) after 2 h of exposure, became more pronounced in the next several hours, then remained stable until the end of the experiment. In cultures exposed to GnRH continuously, the suppressing effects of inhibin preparation became significant (P less than 0.01) after 3 h of exposure and were maximal at 4 h (52% and 61% of control values for FSH and LH, respectively). Later, the suppressing effect became less pronounce due to the decreasing rate of gonadotropin secretion in control (no inhibin) cultures exposed continuously to GnRH. The magnitude of FSH and LH suppression after 9 h of exposure to the inhibin preparation was statistically different (P less than 0.05) for different GnRH treatments and was more pronounced with GnRH pulses (24-27% and 54-57% of control values for FSH and LH, respectively) than with cultures exposed to GnRH continuously (77% and 89% of control values for FSH and LH, respectively) or in the absence of GnRH (50% and 92% of control values for FSH and LH, respectively). We conclude that both the kinetics and magnitude of action of the inhibin preparation on FSH and LH release can differ significantly depending on the presence or absence of GnRH as well as on the mode of GnRH stimulation. Of particular importance is the observation that suppressive effects of inhibin preparation decline in cultures that have been desensitized to GnRH after prolonged continuous GnRH exposures. These differences stress the role of GnRH-inhibin interactions in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion and emphasize the importance of the mode of GnRH stimulation in studies concerning inhibin action on pituitary cells in vitro.\r"

The estrous cycles of 6 Finn-Merino ewes in which the left ovary had been autotransplanted to the neck were synchronized by two injections of cloprostenol (100 micrograms im) a potent analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PG) given 14 days apart. The ewes had ovarian and jugular venous blood samples taken at four hourly intervals from 42 h before the second PG injection until day 6 of the following cycle. All animals responded to PG with the preovulatory LH surge occurring within 58 +/- 2 h (mean +/- SEM). The concentration of FSH in jugular venous plasma fell (P less than 0.001) after the induction of luteolysis and then exhibited 3 peaks, the first coincident with the LH surge, the second on day 1, and the third on day 6. After injection of PG the secretion rates of inhibin, estradiol, and androstenedione increased (P less than 0.05) within 4-8 h. After this increase in the early follicular phase the secretion rate of estradiol continued to rise until the time of the LH surge (P less than 0.001). Although the secretion of androstenedione and inhibin increased in the 36 h before the LH surge the magnitude of this rise was less marked than for estradiol and was not statistically significant. Within 4-8 h of the start of the LH surge the secretion of estradiol and androstenedione declined rapidly reaching barely detectable levels within 16 h (P less than 0.001). In contrast the secretion of inhibin increased after the LH surge reaching a broad peak (P less than 0.05) of approximately 16-h duration, coincident with the second peak of FSH. From days 2-6 mean secretion of inhibin remained relatively stable at 2-6 ng/min although considerable variation was observed in individual profiles. The rate of estradiol secretion increased steadily from its nadir on day 1 to a broad peak centered around day 3 (3-6 ng/min, P less than 0.001) followed by a decline until by day 6 the estradiol secretion rate was less than 1 ng/min (P less than 0.01). The secretory profile for PRL showed a close relationship with estradiol secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reactive oxygen species are produced in the ovary. In luteal cells, peroxide abruptly inhibits LH-sensitive cAMP and progesterone production, and may serve a role as a mediator of luteolysis by such mechanisms. The objective of the present studies was to evaluate the acute actions of peroxide in rat granulosa cells. Peroxide at concentrations in the low micromolar range produced a marked and dose-dependent inhibition of FSH-sensitive cAMP accumulation and progesterone production, and depleted cell levels of ATP within 1 min. Longer treatment with peroxide (60 min) caused complete abrogation of the actions of FSH. Peroxide-induced depletion of ATP was prevented by 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of DNA repair, but maintenance of cell levels of ATP did not prevent the anti-FSH effects of peroxide. Peroxide also abrogated cAMP accumulation and progesterone production in response to LH in granulosa cells. Unlike that seen with LH, inhibition of FSH-sensitive cyclic AMP accumulation by peroxide was partially reversed with isobutylmethyl xanthine, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. Although peroxide inhibited cAMP accumulation in response to cholera toxin, it did not inhibit this same response to forskolin, which indicates that peroxide may interfere with G-protein-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase. Peroxide inhibited steroidogenesis in response to cholera toxin, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP. The marked inhibitory actions of peroxide on gonadotropic hormone action and steroidogenesis in granulosa cells raise the possibility that peroxide may mediate events associated with loss of follicular function.\r"
