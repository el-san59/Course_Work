  ".U": "90068675\r", 
  ".W": "The inferior gluteal musculocutaneous free flap usually provides a sufficient amount of autogenous tissue for breast reconstruction when adequate tissue is not present in the lower abdomen or back. Its arteriovenous pedicle is longer than the superior gluteal musculocutaneous free-flap pedicle and permits microvascular anastomosis in the axilla, avoiding medial rib and cartilage resection. In the thin patient, there is more available donor tissue than with the superior gluteal musculocutaneous free flap. Cadaver dissections confirm the greater pedicle length and the local area of the lower gluteus maximus muscle needed to carry the skin island and have helped define a safe approach to flap elevation. We have used four flaps for breast reconstruction without vascular compromise or the need for reexploration. The low donor-site scar in the inferior buttock fold has been acceptable, especially for a bilateral reconstruction. The anatomy of the gluteal region, the surgical technique for the inferior gluteal free-flap transfer, and a 3-year patient follow-up are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 82 women who had undergone unilateral breast reconstruction with the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were analyzed to determine what effect obesity had on the rate of complications and the aesthetic quality of the ultimate result. The patients were divided into four groups--thin, average, moderately obese, and markedly obese--based on a weight/height index derived by dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in meters. In the thin group (13 patients), the complication rate was only 15.4 percent. In the average group (22 patients), the complication rate was 22.7 percent. In the moderately obese group (35 patients), the complication rate was 31.4 percent. In the markedly obese group (12 patients), the rate was 41.7 percent. Aesthetic results in the abdomen tended to be better in the nonobese group, but in the breast they correlated better with the number of revisions performed than with degree of obesity. The findings in this study suggest that the complication rate of TRAM flap breast reconstruction does increase in proportion to the degree of obesity. Surgeons can therefore avoid many of the complications from TRAM flap surgery by not operating on very obese patients. Reports of complication rates from different authors may vary in part depending on their mix of obese and nonobese patients.\r"

  ".W": "At present, there is no accurate, reliable method of experimentally measuring capsular contracture. This study had four goals: (1) to define the parameters of capsular contracture employing principles of biomechanics of soft tissues, (2) to develop laboratory techniques to measure the parameters, (3) to design an implant that mechanically impedes the process of encapsulation, and, (4) to test this implant against a conventional one. We have developed a breast implant (the Pittsburgh implant) with an altered surface topography. Its silicone shell is punctuated by projections 1 mm in height and 1 mm in diameter. Two techniques were devised to measure contracture. The first involved measuring the force deformation along a coronal axis. The second involved measuring hydrostatic pressures within the implant resulting from the injection of known quantities of saline. Measurements were performed in vivo on 36 animals. By both force and pressure measurements, the Pittsburgh implant showed less capsular contracture (p = 0.12 and 0.012, respectively). Histology revealed that the prototype surface alters the linear arrangement of myofibroblasts and redirects the laminar collagen into a waveform pattern. We conclude from this experimental study that an altered surface topography may serve as a means of rendering a capsule less mechanically effective. We feel that the proposed methods can be used in the laboratory to characterize the extent of capsular contracture.\r"

The senior author has reconstructed ear frameworks in 132 microtia patients, most of whom were under 3 years of age when surgery was initiated. Of this group, 29 were assessed for ear growth through comparison of the lead-plate model of the original normal ear to the normal ear growth and the reconstructed ear framework after a period of at least 2 years. Similarly, 14 reconstructed ears were compared to 14 normal ears at least 2 years after reconstruction. The perimeters of tracings made from the original lead plates and of tracings of normal and reconstructed ears were determined by image analysis techniques. The results demonstrated no significant difference in growth between normal ears and reconstructed ear frameworks after an interval of at least 2.5 years. Therefore, the reconstructed ear is growing at a rate similar to that of the normal ear.\r"

A review of the literature and our own experience confirm the need for early aggressive drainage followed by timely reconstruction. In carefully selected patients, the sternum may be reclosed, provided that omental tissue has been transposed into the defect between the myocardium and the posterior cortex of the sternum. The technique is outlined and the results are analyzed and compared with three additional patient subgroups: (1) sternal wounds rewired over drains, (2) sternal wounds rewired with drains and irrigation catheters, and (3) wounds closed by sternal excision and muscle-flap transposition. To date, nine omental transfers have been performed with complete success. Mediastinal drainage routinely ceases after 3 to 5 days, and hospitalization has averaged 10 to 14 days. Early open debridement allows establishment of drainage and permits close evaluation of the character of the bony sternum. Muscle flaps may then be used in those patients with multiply fractured or frankly necrotic sternal tissue, while sternal closure over omental flaps may be used in all other patients. Adherence to this protocol has allowed for bacteriologic control of the wound, minimal morbidity, and no mortality.\r"

Results of sensibility return were assessed using moving two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, and vibratory testing. Two-point discrimination averaged 4.6 mm for 11 acute digital nerve repairs using vein conduits 1 to 3 cm in length. Delayed digital nerve repair with vein conduits yielded poor results. Semmes-Weinstein values demonstrated comparable levels of return of slowly adapting fiber/receptors to the quickly adapting fiber/receptors, as evidenced by moving two-point discrimination tests. Vibratory sensibility was present in all. A review of previous experiences with end-to-end digital neurorrhaphies and digital nerve grafting suggests that repair of 1- to 3-cm gaps in digital nerves with segments of autologous vein grafts appears to give comparable results to nerve grafting. Further laboratory and clinical research is necessary to better define the role of interpositional vein conduits for repair of peripheral nerves.\r"

Vitamin A, anabolic steroids, and growth hormone will, in the presence of glucocorticoids, restore mesenchymal cell proliferation, the accumulation of collagen, and the rate of increase of wound tensile strength. They will not, however, antagonize the inhibition of wound contraction. A novel inorganic agent, the tetrachlorodecaoxygen anion complex (TCDO), known to enhance the migration and activation of macrophages, was tested in a rat model of impaired wound healing using high doses of glucocorticoids. Histology, changes in wound contraction, collagen synthesis, and tensile strength were evaluated. Animals receiving cortisone in combination with TCDO displayed markedly enhanced wound healing, including restoration of tensile strength, collagen synthesis, and wound contraction. The results indicate that TCDO could be a potential agent of wound healing in immunosuppressed patients and anergic wounds.\r"

PTFE microvascular prostheses (n = 18), mechanically roughened PTFE microvascular prostheses (n = 18), and Chitosan-impregnated PTFE microvascular prostheses (n = 18) (all prostheses: length 1 cm, inside diameter 1.5 mm, fibril length 30 microns) were implanted into the abdominal aortas of rats and were evaluated at 3 days (n = 3), 10 days (n = 3), 3 weeks (n = 6), and 6 weeks (n = 6) with regard to the presence or absence of a clot layer and with regard to the amount of graft healing. All untreated PTFE prostheses were never found to be covered with a clot layer, only scarcely with some platelets, and showed poor neoendothelial healing; even at 6 weeks after implantation, there was only endothelial cell coverage near the anastomotic sides (coverage = 19 +/- 4 percent). The endothelial cells were present directly on the graft surface. In contrast, both the roughened and the Chitosan-impregnated PTFE prostheses were completely covered with a thin clot layer upon implantation and demonstrated significantly better neoendothelial healing (endothelial cell coverage at 6 weeks = 76 +/- 22 percent and 75 +/- 18 percent, respectively; p less than 0.001); moreover, in these prostheses, the endothelial cells were present on a matrix of smooth-muscle cells, which covered the graft surface completely. These results confirm our hypothesis that the induction of a clot layer on the graft surface of microvascular PTFE prostheses improves their healing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The excess skin is then advanced posteriorly, and redundant skin is excised following removal of the expanders.

Triploid offspring derived gynogenetically are more frequent at lower temperature, whereas tetraploid offspring derived sexually are far more frequent at higher temperatures.

A comparison of TCR V beta expression in four different congenic pairs of normal and nu/nu (athymic) mice indicated that the normal V beta deletions associated with tolerance to self minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mlsc) antigens or to self major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded E alpha E beta products did not occur in most athymic mice. Thus, the thymus has a critical role in mediating self tolerance by negative selection.\r"

DNA topoisomerase I, a nuclear enzyme important for solving topological problems arising during DNA replication and for other cellular functions, has been identified as a principal target of a plant alkaloid 20(S)-camptothecin. Significantly increased concentrations of this enzyme, compared to that in normal colonic mucosa, were found in advanced stages of human colon adenocarcinoma and in xenografts of colon cancer carried by immunodeficient mice. Several synthetic analogs of camptothecin, selected by tests with the purified enzyme and tissue-culture screens, were evaluated in the xenograft model. Unlike other anticancer drugs tested, 20(RS)-9-amino-camptothecin (9-AC) induced disease-free remissions. The overall drug toxicity was low and allowed for repeated courses of treatment.\r"

A 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive element (VDRE), which is within the promoter for osteocalcin [a bone protein induced by 1,25(OH)2D3] is unresponsive to other steroid hormones, can function in a heterologous promoter, and contains a doubly palindromic DNA sequence (TTGGTGACTCACCGGGTGAAC; -513 to -493 bp), with nucleotide sequence homology to other hormone responsive elements. The potent glucocorticoid repression of 1,25(OH)2D3 induction and of basal activity of this promoter acts through a region between -196 and +34 bp, distinct from the VDRE.\r"

T cell hybridomas that express the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) zeta homodimer (zeta 2), but not the TCR zeta eta heterodimer, were studied. The zeta eta- cells produced little or no inositol phosphates (IP) when stimulated with antigen. In most cases the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides was also impaired after stimulation with antibody to CD3, although one zeta eta- cell produced normal concentrations of IP. The zeta eta- cells slowed their growth and secreted IL-2 in response to both stimuli. However, the zeta eta- cells did not die after activation with antigen. Since activated thymocytes also undergo programmed cell death, these results may have important implications for the role of the zeta eta.TCR in negative selection.\r"

Solutions of tubulin (the subunit protein of microtubules) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP, the cofactor required for microtubule assembly and oscillations) can generate various dissipative structures. They include traveling waves of microtubule assembly and disassembly as well as polygonal networks. The results imply that cytoskeletal proteins can form dynamic spatial structures by themselves, even in the absence of cellular organizing centers. Thus the microtubule system could serve as a simple model for studying pattern formation by biomolecules in vitro.\r"

Immunization with a formalin-inactivated whole SIV vaccine potentiated with either alum and the Syntex adjuvant threonyl muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or MDP alone resulted in the protection of eight of nine rhesus monkeys challenged with ten animal-infectious doses of pathogenic virus. These results demonstrate that a whole virus vaccine is highly effective in inducing immune responses that can protect against lentivirus infection and AIDS-like disease.\r"

Analysis of Rb metabolism has shown that the protein has a half-life of more than 10 hours and is synthesized at all phases of the cell cycle. Newly synthesized Rb is not extensively phosphorylated (it is \"underphosphorylated\") in cells in the G0 and G1 phases but is phosphorylated at multiple sites at the G1/S boundary and in S phase. HL-60 cells that were induced to terminally differentiate by various chemicals lost their ability to phosphorylate newly synthesized Rb at multiple sites when cell growth was arrested. These findings suggest that underphosphorylated Rb may restrict cell proliferation.\r"

In addition, an inducible endothelial receptor for neutrophils, ELAM-1, supports the adhesion of a human colon carcinoma cell line.

These properties suggest that the expression of VPF by tumor cells could contribute to the increased neovascularization and vessel permeability that are associated with tumor vasculature. The cDNA sequence of VPF from human U937 cells was shown to code for a 189-amino acid polypeptide that is similar in structure to the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) and other PDGF-B-related proteins. The overall identity with PDGF-B is 18%. However, all eight of the cysteines in PDGF-B were found to be conserved in human VPF, an indication that the folding of the two proteins is probably similar. Clusters of basic amino acids in the COOH-terminal halves of human VPF and PDGF-B are also prevalent. Thus, VPF appears to be related to the PDGF/v-sis family of proteins.\r"

Hardware was implicated in 25% of cases occurring after surgery. Diagnosis was confirmed most often by direct vision at reexploration or esophography. Treatment usually consisted of drainage, repair, and parenteral antibiotics; 2 cases were successfully treated by enteral feeding and antibiotics alone. There was one fatality, and all patients required prolonged hospitalization. Cervical fracture and the use of hardware may be associated with this complication. Clinical suspicion and esophography are important diagnostic tools. Drainage and parenteral antibiotics are recommended treatment.\r"

These patients were studied clinically and radiologically, and the initial findings were published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Volume 55B, August 1973. All of these patients were followed clinically and radiologically until 1981 or until their demise. Roentgenographically, 61% have remained unchanged, 27% have shown progression of the atlanto-axial subluxation, and 12% showed decrease in the amount of atlanto-axial subluxation, including one following surgery. During this 10-year period, 12 patients with atlanto-axial subluxation have died, two with historical evidence of neurologic damage. The remaining 10 patients have died from unrelated causes. Only 3 patients underwent surgical stabilization. This study concluded that the atlanto-axial subluxation is compatible with life, but some patients require surgical intervention.\r"

The diameter of the spinal cord was measured to be 7.4 mm in the neutral position, and 6.5 mm in flexion. The difference between the diameter of the neutral and flexed positions was highly significant. Twelve of the 34 patients displayed clinical signs of cervical myelopathy, and 13 showed a significant delay of central motor latency, as calculated from the motor evoked potentials. Surgical intervention, either by a posterior approach only or combined with a transoral dens and inflammatory tissue resection, is recommended in patients with progressive atlanto-axial instability, pathologic clinical and neurophysiologic findings, and a spinal cord diameter of less than 6 mm in flexion. Severe pain and cranial migration of the axis, as measured by the MRI, also justify a surgical intervention.\r"

Although the nonunion rate (12%) and major complication rate (24%) in the present series were higher than those previously reported, the combined rates of all anterior screw fixation series were comparable to those of posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis studies. Three of the complications presented occurred in cases that in retrospect were inappropriate for the use of this technique. These included a verified nonunion and 2 individuals with markedly osteoporotic bone and unfavorable fracture type. Because of the difficulty involved in mastering anterior screw fixation of the dens, its use should be limited to experienced spine surgeons with the appropriate surgical facilities.\r"

The lesions are poorly visualized on plain roentgenogram and most often require bone scan and/or computed axial tomography (CAT) scan for definitive diagnosis. Delay in diagnosis in frequent in these patients (8 of 16). Radiation therapy and external mobilization yield satisfactory results for minor fractures or diffuse involvement without instability. Surgery is rarely indicated for decompression. However, in patients with C1 lateral mass involvement or severe C2 body destruction with instability, posterior stabilization gives excellent relief of pain. Onset after diagnosis of the primary tumor ranges from months to years. Survival is reasonable (mean, 9 months) after diagnosis of upper cervical spine involvement. Understanding these characteristics and the occurrence of metastatic disease in the upper cervical spine allows earlier diagnosis with appropriate radiographic studies and prompt palliation of symptoms.\r"

One patient had complete loss of MEP and was left a respiratory quadriplegic. In 2 cases, MEP amplitudes increased after tumor extirpation and remarkable remissions were observed. The MEP correlated with clinical outcomes and was a useful monitoring technique for upper cervical spine surgery, free of complication. In cat experiments designed to analyze conducting pathways, the maximal amplitude of the initial spike of MEP existed in the ventromedial spinal cord, which contains the extrapyramidal tracts. Motor evoked potential was proven to reflect motor function based on the spinal cord compression study.\r"

Ten of the 54 patients who did not have surgery ascended one to four levels, whereas only 4 of the 80 patients who underwent surgery ascended to similar levels. Myelography demonstrated diffuse swelling of the cord that extended approximately two segments above and below the injured vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging showed intrathecal hemorrhage within the first 2 weeks followed by cord atrophy within 4 weeks after the initial trauma. Thorough decompression of the cord with rigid internal fixation markedly reduced the incidence of this complication.\r"

  ".W": "Prior to the advent of computer-assisted imaging techniques, conventional radiographic studies did not accurately depict the severity of soft tissue injury (spinal cord and paravertebral tissue) attending severe spinal trauma. Computed tomography scanning is clearly superior to plain radiography in the demonstration of osseous fractures and impactions, but this modality does not clearly depict ligamentous or disc injuries and does not image the spinal cord directly. The authors' preliminary experience indicates that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) more accurately defines the extent of soft tissue damage in the zone of injury. In this study, the authors correlate these objective imaging techniques with findings on neurologic exam. Seventy-eight patients with cervical spine injuries admitted to the Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of the Delaware Valley between August 1987 and January 1989 were evaluated with surface-coil MRI on a 1.5-Tesla unit. Fifty-nine patients were studied within 7 days of injury. Image sequences consisting of T1-, proton density, and T2-weighted images were obtained in saggital views. Axial gradient recalled acquisitions in the steady state (GRASS) images were obtained from most patients. We learned that certain patterns of MRI signal were associated with severe neurologic deficit. These include: 1) intramedullary hematoma and 2) spinal cord contusion associated with edema encompassing more than one spinal segment. Magnetic resonance imaging findings also correlated with less severe injury and include 1) normal spinal cord signal and 2) small focal contusions associated with edema encompassing one spinal segment or less.\r"

There was no significant difference between the treatment groups regarding neurologic improvement. In experimental studies on rats, the increased levels of lipid peroxides and thromboxane after spinal cord injury were found to be proportional to the magnitude of injury. These evidences suggest that spinal cord injury is directly related with the magnitude of injury, and the prognosis is determined entirely at the time of injury.\r"

These ligaments were tested under in situ conditions by transecting all the elements except the one (AL or LF) under study. A fixture was designed to properly align the specimen to induce a uniaxial mode of loading. A six-axis load cell was placed at the distal end of the specimen. The proximal end of the specimen was attached to the piston of a specially designed electrohydraulic testing device. The biomechanical properties of the ligaments were determined at four different loading rates of 8.89, 25.0, 250.0 and 2500 mm/sec. The mechanical response indicated nonlinear and sigmoidal characteristics. The ultimate tensile failure load, stiffness, and energy-absorbing capacity at failure were found to increase with increasing loading rates for both the AL and LF. However, the distractions at failure did not indicate this tendency. While the ultimate tensile force and ultimate energy-absorbing capacity varied nonlinearly with the logarithm of the loading rate, the stiffness varied linearly.\r"

Young pig spines were injured at high speed to produce clinically relevant fractures and dislocations. The injuries were produced by dropping a mass onto the superior vertebra and causing three major types of trauma: flexion-compression, extension-compression, and pure compression. The multidirectional instability of each spine was measured before and after trauma by applying pure moments to the three vertebrae segments. Lateral radiographs were taken of each intact and injured spine. Flexion trauma produced the greatest instabilities in flexion and extension, while extension trauma produced the greatest instabilities in axial rotation and lateral bending. Lateral radiographs were found to be inaccurate predictors of spinal instability.\r"

Fresh human ligamentous spines (C2-T2) were potted, and clinically relevant loads were applied by a loading frame attached to the C2 vertebra of each specimen. A set of three infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were attached rigidly to each of four vertebrae (C4 to C7) to record their spatial locations after each load step application using a Selspot II (Selcom Selective Electronic, Inc., Valdese, North Carolina) system. The specimen was tested in the intact state, following discectomy at the C5-6 intervertebral level, following insertion of a bone graft in the intervertebral space, and following the application of an anterior metal plate. The load-deformation data of the injured and stabilized tests were normalized with regard to the corresponding results of the intact specimens. At the injured level (C5-6), the load-deformation results indicated a highly significant increase in motion in flexion (66.6%), extension (69.5%), lateral bending (41.3%), and axial rotation (37.9%). After the insertion of the bone graft, a significant decrease in motion was seen in the effected segment in extension (-45.9%), with similar reductions in lateral bending and axial rotation and a smaller reduction in flexion. The application of an anterior metal plate in addition to the bone graft at the injured level provided significant reduction in motion (-70%) in all load modalities. This data may have clinical relevance regarding the role of internal fixation in cases of severe spine instability.\r"

This study was undertaken to evaluate the above constructs and other constructs in human cadaveric spines. Six subaxial human cervical spine specimens were biomechanically tested at the C5-C6 motion segment both intact and with a simulated distractive-flexion Stage 3 injury created at the C5-C6 level with complete disruption of the supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, posterior longitudinal ligament, and facet joint capsules; with sufficient disruption of the intervertebral disc to allow a bilateral C5-C6 facet dislocation. The specimens were tested with a six-channel Bionix MTS 858 materials tester (M.T.S., Minneapolis, Minnesota) using cyclic loads to simulate cervical compression, flexion, extension, and rotation with measurements of axial load, axial displacement, torque, rotation, and anterior and posterior strains. Eight constructs were tested nondestructively: the intact spinal segment, sublaminar wiring, Rogers' wiring, Bohlman's wiring method (triple-wire technique), Roy-Camille posterior plate fixation, AO posterior hook-plate fixation, Caspar anterior plate fixation, and AO posterior hook-plate with Caspar anterior plate fixation. There was no significant difference in flexural stiffness and torsional stiffness between any of the constructs tested; however, there was a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the posterior strain during flexion and axial loading tests between the Caspar plate construct and all other tested constructs, including the combined posterior and anterior plating construct. These differences persisted after cyclic testing of 100 cycles. Biomechanical testing demonstrated no significant differences between any of the posterior stabilization methods tested. Caspar anterior plating is clearly an inferior method of treating distractive flexion injuries of the cervical spine when compared with all posterior fixation techniques. Also, there is little biomechanical justification for the use of potentially dangerous sublaminar wire fixation and posterior plating methods in these injuries (with intact bony posterior elements), since the relatively safe interspinous wiring methods (Rogers' and Bohlman) are just as rigid as these other posterior fixation techniques.\r"

Acute pseudotumor presents with abrupt, painful onset, and CT scan shows a diffuse process with no distinct mass to biopsy. Chronic or recurrent pseudotumor leads to a mass of fibrosis apparent on CT scan, which should be biopsied. Lymphoid tumor presents without pain, and orbital CT scan shows a homogenous mass that should be biopsied. Acute pseudotumor usually responds to steroids, but patients with chronic or recurrent pseudotumor may require low-dose radiation or immunosuppressive therapy. Lymphoid tumors that are classified as reactive lymphoid hyperplasia initially may be treated with steroids, followed by low-dose radiation if steroids are ineffective. Orbital lymphomas are treated with higher dose radiation and, perhaps, chemotherapy, if systemic disease is present. Reports of representative cases of acute and chronic pseudotumor and lymphoid tumor illustrate the distinguishing clinical, radiologic and pathologic characteristics of each type of tumor, and recommendations for management of each type are outlined.\r"

After 4 weeks the animals were killed, the parathyroid glands were removed and weighed, and blood samples were obtained. Of 30 rats, uremia developed in 22 (73%; uremic group) and eight (27%) died or did not become uremic. A sham-operated group of 15 rats served as control (control group). Creatinine levels were 1.8 +/- 0.5 mg/dl in the uremic group versus 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/dl in the control group (p less than 0.0001). Parathyroid glands were hyperplastic in all rats with uremia and were heavier than parathyroid glands of control animals (70.3 +/- 26 vs 19.1 +/- 8 micrograms; p less than 0.0001). In the group with uremia, parathyroid hormone levels were increased over those of the control group (112.6 +/- 13 vs 28.9 +/- 6.2 pg/ml; p less than 0.0001), whereas osteocalcin levels were similar (36.6 +/- 11 vs 37.5 +/- 1 ng/ml). Serum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase levels were similar in both groups. Our model can be used to test hypotheses concerning the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the relative pathogenetic relevance of vitamin D deficiency and phosphate retention.\r"

Significant rhythms for serum phosphorus, ionized calcium, PTH, urine phosphorus, and urine calcium were observed in many but not all patients before and after surgery. Nonetheless, collective analysis revealed the following: (1) diurnal patterns for serum ionized calcium, phosphorus, urine calcium, and urine phosphorus in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism both before and after surgery, whereas a rhythm for serum PTH was uniquely observed after surgical treatment; and (2) no significant correlation between preoperative serum ionized calcium and PTH but restoration of the expected reciprocal relationship between these variables after surgery. Although variability in individual expression of the rhythm for PTH precludes precise definition of a sampling \"window\" when hormone levels are likely to be highest, collection of data at points throughout the day helped establish the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism in several patients with borderline serum biochemistries.\r"

Among a group of 282 patients who were treated for primary hyperparathyroidism in recent years at the University of Chicago Medical Center, 14 (4.8%) had undergone one or more previous thyroidectomies, and 6 others (2.1%) had undergone thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine as therapy for Graves' disease. Numerous difficulties were encountered during surgery in the postthyroidectomy group of patients as a result of scarring and fibrosis, prior recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries in 13%, the inability to known with certainty how many viable, normal parathyroid glands remained after previous operations, and the need for additional thyroid resection, mostly for associated malignant lesions. Preoperative vocal cord assessment, evaluation of prior operative and pathology reports, and localization studies with thallium-technetium scanning and ultrasonographic techniques were especially helpful. A \"lateral approach\" was used frequently during surgery. Each of these 14 patients was cured of the hyperparathyroidism. The postthyroid ablation group presented fewer intraoperative challenges, although in some patients the thyroid gland was virtually absent, which obscured the normal landmarks of the surgical field. Five of these six patients were cured of hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy after thyroidectomy presents many operative challenges to the surgeon and should be approached with the same care and concern that one reserves for a reoperative parathyroid operation.\r"

Their age at the time of 131I treatment ranged from 21 to 72 years, and the interval to detection of hypercalcemia was between 3 and 27 years. It is noteworthy that all patients treated for Graves' disease had absorbed radiation doses large enough to cause permanent hypothyroidism, and half of them showed complete absence of the thyroid gland at subsequent operation for hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, parathyroid adenomas had developed at the sites of thyroid remnants in cases with 131I ablation after tumor operations. Our findings support other observations indicating that not only external radiation but also radiation from 131I is a risk factor for development of hyperparathyroidism, and it is emphasized that age at the time of radiation treatment may be of decisive importance in this context.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pretransplant (day -6) systemic intravenous or portal venous immunization with modified donor antigen combined with cyclophosphamide treatment (75 mg/kg on day -4) on rat parathyroid allograft survival was evaluated. Systemic intravenous preimmunization of Buffalo recipients with 10(8) untreated Lewis donor spleen cells plus cyclophosphamide resulted in 100% accelerated rejection of Lewis parathyroid allografts (mean survival time, 7.3 +/- 0.9 days vs 10.8 +/- 1.1 days for controls). Portal venous administration of untreated cells plus cyclophosphamide reduced accelerated rejection to 40% but could not prolong graft survival (10.8 +/- 2.7 days). Intravenous or portal venous preimmunization with heat-inactivated cells (45 degrees C for 60 minutes) plus cyclophosphamide also did not prolong graft survival, with accelerated rejection occurring in 20% and 40% of recipients, respectively. In contrast, preimmunization by either route with ultraviolet B-irradiated cells (UVB; 12,000 joule/m2) plus cyclophosphamide significantly prolonged graft survival (intravenous = 22.2 +/- 6.0 days and portal venous = 21.4 +/- 7.2 days; p less than 0.005), with no accelerated rejection. Preimmunization with UVB cells combined with cyclophosphamide was synergistic, because neither treatment alone prolonged allograft survival (UVB cell preimmunization only = 10.8 +/- 1.3 days; cyclophosphamide only = 12.6 +/- 2.6 days). The effect of UVB preimmunization was donor specific because third-party Wistar-Furth UVB cells had no effect on Lewis graft survival (12.5 +/- 2.9 days). We conclude that pretreatment with UVB-modified donor antigen plus cyclophosphamide induces allospecific immune hyporesponsiveness and prolongs parathyroid allograft survival.\r"

  ".U": "90069828\r", 
  ".W": "The pseudogout syndrome has been suggested to be a diagnostic clue of hyperparathyroidism or a complication after parathyroidectomy that abruptly relieves hypercalcemia. In this report of 20 patients who had pseudogout, eight had intermittent attacks of arthritis associated with chondrocalcinosis that led through the pseudogout syndrome to a confirmed diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. In an additional 12 patients, the diagnosis of pseudogout was made in patients who suffered from acute arthritis after parathyroidectomy that relieved the primary hyperparathyroidism. The postoperative attacks were seen most commonly on or after the second day after surgery and were associated with the lowest point in serum calcium levels. Pseudogout occurred in one or more joints, often involving the knee. The diagnosis was proved by aspiration of joint synovial fluid in many of the patients and identification of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals. To estimate the incidence of pseudogout in the population of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, these 20 patients were distinguished in 531 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy, for a 3.8% incidence of the pseudogout feature. No other markers of higher risk for this complication were apparent, including age, sex, biochemistry, or prior history. This collected experience suggests that (1) pseudogout is a biochemical entity associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and may offer a useful clue to the recognition of the disease in screening; (2) acute arthritis after parathyroidectomy is most likely pseudogout, and this complication occurs more frequently than has been recognized previously; (3) patients with hypercalcemia have a high incidence of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition in articular cartilage (chondrocalcinosis); and (4) relative hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy is a stimulus for crystal shedding into synovial fluid, which may precipitate acute attacks of pseudogout.\r"

Functional in vitro studies showed no significant difference in suppressibility and basal parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion (61% and 74%, respectively). In both types of glands A, B, C, and D regions could be distinguished with use of a stereo magnifier (magnification, x10 to x16). In diffuse A regions containing stroma fat cells, PTH secretion could be suppressed optimally (more than 50% of maximum secretion) in more than 90% of all specimens in vitro. In diffuse B regions containing no fat cells, hormonal secretion could be suppressed in only 17% and 25%, respectively. Confined (oxyphilic or chief cell) nodules (C regions), only found in type 2 glands, could be suppressed in 18%. Nodules of \"degenerating\" oxyphilic cells (D regions), only found in type 2 glands, were suppressible, but the low PTH secretion indicated degenerative processes. Thus only fragments from A regions should be selected for autotransplantation.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of our renal transplant population between 1981 and 1987 was undertaken to study the natural history of posttransplant hypercalcemia and to review indications and recommendations regarding the timing of parathyroidectomy. During this period, 1158 renal transplant procedures were performed in 1025 patients, with 819 allografts (71%) functioning currently. Posttransplant hypercalcemia greater than 10.5 mg/dl was associated with a longer duration of dialysis and developed in 227 patients, with onset of hypercalcemia occurring in 90% of these patients by 1 year. In 69% of these patients, spontaneous resolution of the hypercalcemia occurred between 6 months and 7 years after transplantation. A total of 42 patients with asymptomatic hypercalcemia are currently being followed up, with a mean serum calcium level of 11.0 +/- 0.41 mg/dl and a mean follow-up interval of 3.3 +/- 1.6 years since transplantation. Nine symptom-free patients with moderate hypercalcemia (12.0 to 12.4 mg/dl) more than 1 year after transplantation were identified. Five of these patients had spontaneous resolution of the hypercalcemia between 2 and 7 years. Fifteen patients with posttransplant hyperparathyroidism (6.6%) required parathyroidectomy--11 for symptomatic and four for asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. One patient had symptomatic hyperparathyroidism despite the presence of normocalcemia. One symptom-free patient with significant hypercalcemia (serum calcium level, 14.7 mg/dl) underwent parathyroidectomy 3 months after transplantation. The remaining three symptom-free patients had serum calcium determinations of greater than or equal to 12.5 mg/dl more than 1 year after renal transplantation. Patients with pretransplant and posttransplant hypercalcemia required parathyroidectomy more frequently than did patients with only posttransplant hypercalcemia (18% versus 3.0%; p less than 0.001). An unusual finding was the occurrence of a single adenoma in two patients, which represents sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism in the patient undergoing renal transplantation rather than tertiary hyperparathyroidism. We recommend a conservative approach to posttransplant hypercalcemia, with surgery reserved for patients with symptomatic disease and patients with asymptomatic persistent hypercalcemia greater than or equal to 12.5 mg/dl more than 1 year after transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine parathyroid tissue was evaluated as a model to compare parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Tissue was incubated in variable calcium levels (n = 5). A parathyroid cell digest was prepared from collagenase-treated glands. PTH-rP and PTH levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. PTH-rP bioactivity was determined by 3H-cAMP production in a UMR 106 cell bioassay. PTH-rP levels in the incubation medium were 2.0 ng/mg protein (0.25 mmol Ca++), 2.2 ng/mg protein (1.25 mmol Ca++), and 1.9 ng/mg protein (2.5 mmol/L Ca++). PTH levels were 321 ng/mg protein (0.25 mmol/L Ca++) and 200 ng/mg protein (2.5 mmol Ca++). Therefore, calcium significantly inhibited PTH but not PTH-rP secretion (p = 0.03). Addition of incubation medium to the bioassay resulted in 3H-cAMP levels that were 8 to 10 times greater than basal levels. Greater than 50% of the activity persisted after addition of PTH antibody, demonstrating that a significant amount of the activity was caused by PTH-rP. Tissue PTH-rP was 5.1 ng/mg protein, compared with 2080 ng/mg protein for PTH. We conclude that (1) bovine parathyroid tissue contains bioactive PTH-rP and is a useful model to compare the biosynthesis and secretion of PTH-rP and PTH in normal tissue and (2) unlike PTH, PTH-rP secretion is not regulated by calcium.\r"

Of 31 patients studied by bone densitometry, 16 showed moderate to severe osteoporosis. In approximately 20% of the total group, bone demineralization, including a bone fracture problem in some, was the dominant or a major indication for operation. Serial bone studies in six patients taken preoperatively or in patients not operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism showed an average loss of bone mineral density of 0.9% per year, whereas in four patients treated surgically serial studies showed an average increase of 9.8% per year. Although estrogen intake reduced serum calcium levels, significant bone demineralization or fractures were present in four patients aged 40 to 59 years and in five patients more than 60 years of age who had taken estrogens for many years. We conclude that in primary hyperparathyroidism, bone demineralization (1) justifies surgical correction in a significant number of patients; (2) should be evaluated, especially in elderly women; (3) is not prevented by estrogen intake, which may instead confuse decision making; (4) is reversed after surgical correction, but suggestions of incomplete reversal emphasize importance of this factor; (5) should be considered in postoperative management; and (6) involves many variables.\r"

Cholelithiasis is known to be more common after truncal vagotomy, with or without concomitant subtotal gastric resection, and the prevalence of gallstones in these patients is reported to be 16% to 38%. To date, however, no long-term study has investigated the prevalence of gallstones after total gastrectomy in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Since 1961, 26 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have undergone total gastrectomy and were enrolled in a Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Research Center protocol that allowed follow-up to assess the development of cholelithiasis. Eight patients had cholecystectomy at the time of total gastrectomy (seven patients had stones), leaving 18 patients with a normal gallbladder and no gallstones at the time of total gastrectomy. Four patients died early, two of surgical complications, one of tumor progression, and one of alcohol-related trauma. During follow-up, cholelithiasis has developed in 10 of 14 patients (71%) at risk; the mean time to gallstones was 6.3 years (range, 1.2 to 12.9 years). The predictable occurrence of cholelithiasis after total gastrectomy in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suggests that cholecystectomy should be performed at the time of total gastrectomy.\r"

Somatostatin (SRIF) is a peptide that inhibits gastrin release, is present within the gastric fundus and antrum, and is under vagal control. In this study we have investigated the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia is associated with a decrease in gastric SRIF. We examined tissue levels of SRIF in gastric mucosa and muscle wall in rabbits undergoing vagotomy and pyloroplasty compared with sham-operated controls. We also compared the release of SRIF from gastric glands in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Vagotomy resulted in an increase in gastrin compared with controls in both antrum (1062 +/- 176 pmol/gm vs 484 +/- 48 pmol/gm) and plasma (236 +/- 72 pmol/L vs 29 +/- 4 pmol/L; p less than 0.05). This was accompanied by an increase in the number of gastrin cells (25 +/- 4 vs 9 +/- 3; p less than 0.05). No significant differences were observed in gastric SRIF levels in either the fundus or antrum (p greater than 0.5). In addition, there were no differences in the release of SRIF from gastric glands of vagotomized animals compared with controls in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide (p greater than 0.5). These data suggest that the elevations in plasma and antral gastrin levels after vagotomy are not a result of alterations in gastric SRIF.\r"

In addition, in patients with functional syndromes, islet-cell tumors usually develop, and these may or may not be malignant. Because of the presumed inability to alleviate or cure the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) in MEN patients, total gastrectomy was the treatment of choice before the introduction of H2 antagonists and omeprazole. At present, many physicians and surgeons consider H2 antagonists the best treatment and advise pancreatic exploration only when a gross pancreatic tumor is demonstrated on imaging studies. During the past 10 years we have studied all MEN I patients with ZES without hepatic metastases or gross pancreatic tumors using percutaneous transhepatic selective venous gastrin samplings. Two patterns of gastrin secretion were identified: (1) diffuse from multiple pancreatic sites and (2) localized regional secretion. Four patients from the latter group were selected for attempted surgical \"cure\" without gastrectomy or total pancreatectomy. Two additional patients are included who had resection of gastrinomas and have maintained basal serum gastrin levels within the normal range for extended periods. The follow-up on these patients ranges from 5 months to 12 years. All six patients have normal basal gastrin values, and those with remaining stomachs require no drug therapy.\r"

Sources of hypergastrinemia included antral G cell hyperplasia (AGCH) (17), pancreatic gastrinomas (14), duodenal gastrinomas (11), multiple gastrinomas in patients with type I multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN I) (five), lymph node gastrinomas (four), and the source not found in nine patients. Eugastrinemia was achieved by resection in 17 of 17 patients with AGCH, nine of 11 patients with duodenal gastrinomas, three of four patients with lymph node gastrinomas, zero of 14 patients with pancreatic gastrinomas, zero of five patients with MEN I, and zero of nine patients in whom the source was not found. Hepatic metastases developed in 11 patients with pancreatic gastrinomas, two patients with MEN I, one patient with duodenal gastrinomas, and one patient with lymph node gastrinomas. One patient in whom the source of the hypergastrinemia was not found developed hepatic metastases, and seven required total gastrectomy. This experience suggests the following: (1) that patients with AGCH, duodenal gastrinomas, or lymph node gastrinomas can usually be rendered eugastrinemic by resection; (2) that patients with pancreatic gastrinomas, whether sporadic or familial (MEN I), are rarely cured by resection and frequently develop hepatic metastases; and (3) that patients in whom the source of the hypergastrinemia is not identified and removed frequently require total gastrectomy, but antroduodenectomy should be considered because it may uncover an occult duodenal microneurogastrinoma or may correct AGCH.\r"

Prior studies suggest, however, that hypergastrinemia after fundusectomy occurs earlier and to a greater degree than hypergastrinemia after total acid inhibition with high dose (8 mg/kg/day) famotidine. To explain the very early (0 to 21-day) gastrin response, 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 to 350 gm) were equally allocated to fundusectomy alone, famotidine alone, and fundusectomy plus famotidine groups. Vena cava blood samples and antral tissue were harvested at 0, 4, 7, 9, 14, and 21 days. Fundusectomy produced dramatic, sustained hypergastrinemia as early as 4 days after the procedure. Minimal, transient hypergastrinemia was seen with famotidine treatment, but this returned to baseline in spite of total acid inhibition. Antral gastrin was comparable in all three groups at the intervals assessed. Furthermore, fundusectomy plus famotidine did not demonstrate a significant difference from fundusectomy alone. Thus it appears that fundusectomy produces early and sustained hypergastrinemia by a mechanism other than acid inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric carcinoid tumor formation has been reported with prolonged achlorhydria in both animals and human beings. The hypothesis in this study was that the ablation of parietal cell function in an animal (mastomys) genetically predisposed to gastric neuroendocrine neoplasia would promote and accelerate tumor formation. Loxtidine, an irreversible H2-receptor blocker, was administered at 1 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 4 months to young mastomys (n = 16). After 4 months of treatment, 14 of 16 animals had gastric carcinoids compared with 0 of 16 young control animals and 4 of 16 older control animals. Ultrastructurally, these tumors were characterized by the presence of neurosecretory granules. Serum gastrin levels were elevated (230 +/- 40 pmol/L) in loxtidine-treated animals compared with control animals (26 +/- 8 pmol/L) (p less than 0.05). In addition, both peptide YY (620 +/- 160 pmol/L) and enteroglucagon (500 +/- 147 pmol/L) were significantly elevated compared with control groups (p less than 0.05). Similarly, in tumor tissue, peptide YY (676 +/- 152 pmol/gm) and enteroglucagon (551 +/- 164 pmol/gm) were found in large quantities, whereas gastrin was undetectable. These observations provide substantial support for the possible pathophysiologic role of gut peptides, particularly gastrin, in the generation of endocrine neoplasia. The advent of endocrine tumors after inhibition of a gut secretory cell (parietal) may be of considerable significance in understanding the genesis of endocrine neoplasia. Whether the drug acts as a neoplastic promoter of enterochromaffin-like cells or the tumor development is related to elevation of peptides such as gastrin cannot be established in this study. Long-term H2-receptor blockade with new potent, irreversible agents as an alternative to surgery may have potential grave implications that require careful consideration.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro isolated liver perfusion in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis (CP) has been shown to demonstrate hepatic resistance to insulin. The ability of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) to reverse the resistance to insulin on glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose production was therefore investigated in this model. CP was induced in 250 to 300 gm Sprague-Dawley rats by infusion of 50 microliters of 99% oleic acid into the pancreas via the common bile duct. After 6 to 8 weeks, isolated liver perfusion was performed on livers from both CP rats and sham-operated control animals (n = 12, 14), both with and without PP administration. Glucagon infusion (100 pg/ml for 30 minutes) produced a five- to sixfold increase in hepatic glucose production. The integrated hepatic glucose output (IHGO) response to glucagon alone was comparable in pancreatic and sham-operated animals; during period 1 (0 to 10 minutes) IHGO was 7.1 +/- 0.5 mg/gm-min for sham-operated controls (n = 8) and 7.1 +/- 0.4 mg/gm-min for pancreatitic animals (n = 6) without PP treatment. Animals that received PP (100 ng intraperitoneally 5 hours before liver harvest and perfusion with 4.2 ng/ml from 10 to 30 minutes) demonstrated an IHGO for period 1 for the sham (n = 6) and pancreatitic animals (n = 6) of 5.6 +/- 0.6 and 4.8 +/- 0.8 mg/gm-min, respectively. Insulin infusion (100 microU/ml added to perfusate from 10 to 30 minutes) in CP livers without PP revealed impaired responsiveness to insulin; the ratio of period 3 (20 to 30 minutes)/period 1 IHGO was 110% +/- 5% in CP livers compared with 77% +/- 5% in sham controls (p less than 0.01). In contrast, PP treatment restored hepatic responsiveness to insulin to control levels; the period 3/period 1 IHGO was 75% +/- 13% in CP livers treated with PP, which was indistinguishable from the 67% +/- 9% response seen in sham-operated control animals. These data provide the first in vitro evidence of a primary hepatic glucoregulatory role of PP. Therefore PP deficiency may contribute to altered glucose metabolism through the induction of a reversible hepatic resistance to insulin.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of growth factors in proliferative disorders of the breast, we assayed breast cyst fluid from 70 patients for calcitonin-related peptides. Cyst fluids (5.4 +/- 6.6 ml) (mean +/- SD) (n = 70) contained 10,499 +/- 8272 pg/ml of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-like immunoreactivity in 66 of 70 samples. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like immunoreactivity was found in 64 of 64 samples tested (3842 +/- 2048 pg/ml). Calcitonin-like immunoreactivity was detected in 47 of 69 samples (185 +/- 106 pg/ml). Significant correlations were found for GRP versus volume, CGRP, and calcitonin, for calcitonin versus volume and CGRP, and for CGRP versus volume. Extracts of two human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and BT-20) contained measurable GRP-like immunoreactivity. We conclude that GRP-, CGRP-, and calcitonin-like immunoreactivities are present in human breast cyst fluid and that GRP-like immunoreactivity is present in two established human breast carcinoma cell lines. High concentrations of GRP-like immunoreactivity in both breast cyst fluid and breast carcinoma tissue, taken together with the known mitogenic and trophic activities of this peptide, support the hypothesis that GRP may be an important factor in human breast disease.\r"

Nicardipine was used orally in the preoperative period for either 1 or 8 days (60 to 120 mg/24 hr) and then was infused during anesthesia until tumor removal, continuously at a rate of 2.5 to 7.5 micrograms/kg/min, depending on systolic arterial pressure level. All patients were successfully operated on. No severe hypertensive crisis occurred during tumor manipulation, although several patients had a 3- to 85-fold (norepinephrine) and 3- to 40-fold (epinephrine) increase of catecholamines from baseline levels. Hemodynamics data suggest that nicardipine caused significant inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction (42% decrease in systemic vascular resistance); calcium-dependent catecholamines release was not inhibited by nicardipine infused as mentioned. Use of nicardipine may be recommended for perioperative and intraoperative control of pheochromocytomas and might substitute for routine alpha-adrenergic blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The medical records of 32 patients with primary aldosteronism who underwent adrenalectomy at the University of Michigan Medical Center from January 1975 to February 1988 were reviewed. All 32 patients had the preoperative diagnosis of aldosterone-secreting adrenal cortical neoplasms. Based on pathology reports, however, 21 of 32 (66%) patients were confirmed to have adrenal cortical neoplasms. Ten of 32 (31%) patients had nodular hyperplasia, and 1 of 32 (3%) had diffuse hyperplasia. This report focuses on the results in 11 patients with idiopathic aldosteronism. In six of nine (67%) patients, aldosterone levels rose within 4 hours of patients assuming an upright posture after salt loading. Seven patients had selective adrenal venous aldosterone/cortisol ratios that were interpreted to lateralize to one adrenal gland; however, only four of seven (57%) had ratios of 3:1 or greater than the contralateral adrenal gland. In 6 of 11 (55%) patients, adrenal scans (NP-59) initially demonstrated unilateral uptake. Three of four computerized axial tomographic scans demonstrated a unilateral adrenal mass. Only 3 of 11 (27%) patients with idiopathic aldosteronism were normotensive after surgery. Four of 11 (36%) patients' conditions were improved, in that they became normotensive with antihypertensive medication. These data suggest that if both imaging and functional studies lateralize to one adrenal gland, it is reasonable to expect either a cure or an improvement after adrenalectomy among patients with primary aldosteronism caused by idiopathic aldosteronism. Unilateral adrenalectomy may be the treatment of choice in carefully selected patients with nodular hyperplasia causing primary aldosteronism.\r"

There was one cancer death, and three patients are alive with cancer. Such patients have a superficial resemblance to the Hiroshima maiden group of young women who survived atomic bombing and experienced severe facial burns, necessitating extensive plastic surgery. As atomic survivors they are at increased risk for cancer of thyroid, salivary gland, lung, breast, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. The North American Hiroshima maiden should warrant easy clinical recognition and require lifetime scrutiny for multisite neoplastic disease.\r"

Because free thyroxine (FT4) is the metabolically active form of T4, our study was designed to determine whether FT4 by analog radioimmunoassay method is normal or increased in euthyroid patients receiving L-thyroxine. Twenty-seven clinically euthyroid patients, 5 males and 22 females, receiving L-thyroxine for thyroid suppression, were studied in a prospective protocol. Twenty-one euthyroid patients not receiving L-thyroxine served as controls. Samples were analyzed for T4, T3, T3 (RU), TSH, and FT4 by three analog methods. Mean FT4 levels were greater than control for all three assays. The percentage of patients with FT4 in the hyperthyroid range was 63% for assay I, 41% for assay II, and 52% for assay III. When patients were grouped by dose of L-thyroxine, FT4 levels were not significantly increased. Sixty-two percent of patients receiving L-thyroxine had T4 levels in the hyperthyroid range. T3 concentrations were not significantly greater in the L-thyroxine group when compared with control. In the L-thyroxine group, thyrotropin was significantly less than in the control group. FT4 concentration by analog method is in the hyperthyroid range in as many as 63% of clinically euthyroid patients receiving L-thyroxine. The use of FT4 to assess thyroid status may cause inappropriate adjustment of L-thyroxine dose. T3 level continues to parallel closely the physician's clinical impression and best represents peripheral metabolic status.\r"

Twenty-one patients (9%) with 131I uptake of 3% or more (group 1) were treated with 150 to 200 mCi of 131I. Forty-four patients (19%) with less than 3% uptake (group 2) and 169 patients (72%) without evidence of metastases or extrathyroidal spread (group 3) were treated only with thyroid hormone. All patients initially underwent total thyroidectomy and modified neck dissection if cervical lymph node metastases were present. Three patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 had recurrent tumor with a mean follow-up of 8.9 and 8.4 years. There were no recurrences in group 3 with a mean follow-up of 7.2 years. Death rate from thyroid carcinoma was 5% in group 1 (one patient) and 0% in groups 2 and 3. In conclusion, 131I scanning and therapy may be omitted in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma in the absence of local tumor extension or regional or distant metastases. Therapy with 131I is not demonstrated to be of benefit in this population of patients.\r"

Mean age at diagnosis was 61 years. The manifestation of bone metastases was the presenting symptom in 18 patients (60%). Treatment included total thyroidectomy, levothyroxine sodium therapy, and radioactive iodine treatments. Twenty-seven patients had bone metastases from the initial observation, with 44 sites involved. Of the sites, 27 (61%) were shown both on iodine 131 whole-body scan (WBS) and on x-ray film, 11 (25%) only on WBS, and six (14%) only on x-ray film. Multiple involvement was observed in 11 patients. The radiologic appearance was invariably osteolytic. Serum thyroglobulin was elevated in all patients. After radioactive iodine, no WBS+/X-ray+ metastases showed a complete response, although a sclerotic border was noted in several cases, whereas six WBS+/X-ray- lesions were no longer detectable by WBS. Treatment with radioactive iodine and bone surgery resulted in a complete cure in three patients and in a reduction of tumor mass in three. Twenty-one (70%) of the patients died of thyroid cancer after a mean survival of 86 months. Of the nine patients still alive, two are free of disease, three have a good quality of life, and four have severe disability.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) activity and the growth and differentiation of thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin. Thyroid neoplasms generally have higher TSH-stimulated AC activity than normal thyroid tissue from the same patients. To determine whether differences in TSH receptors could account for the differences in AC activity, we studied the 8000 g membrane particulate fraction from 28 thyroid tissues (10 papillary carcinomas, 6 multinodular goiters, 4 follicular adenomas, 3 follicular carcinomas, 2 Graves, 1 normal, 1 Hurthle cell adenoma, and 1 thyroiditis). TSH receptors were measured by competitive inhibition using radioactive iodine-labeled bovine TSH (125I-bTSH). Maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were calculated by Scatchard analysis. AC activity was measured by the conversion of alpha-[32P]-ATP to [32P]-cAMP in the maximally (300 mU/ml) TSH-stimulated state. The basal and forskolin-stimulated (100 mmol/L) AC activity were also measured, and the ratios to TSH-stimulated AC activity were calculated (TSH/Basal ratio and TSH/Forskolin ratio). We found a strong correlation between the percent specific binding (%SB) of 125I-bTSH and TSH/Basal ratio (r = 0.70, p = 0.0001), between Bmax and the TSH/Basal ratio (r = 0.71, p = 0.001), between %SB and TSH/Forskolin ratio (r = 0.44, p = 0.02), and between Bmax and TSH/Forskolin ratio (r = 0.65, p = 0.0002). This strong correlation between TSH binding and the TSH-stimulated AC activity suggests that in some thyroid neoplasms the higher AC response to TSH may be due to an increased number of TSH receptors.\r"

To provide convincing data that malignant disease has not been overlooked requires extended follow-up on a large number of patients with cytologically benign lesions. The intent of our study was to assess the long-term accuracy of thyroid FNA-based diagnoses--particularly with respect to false-negative errors. From our total experience of more than 8000 patients, we reviewed the cases of 680 patients who underwent FNA in 1980, the first year we used it clinically. Follow-up information was obtained on 641 (94%) of the patients with a mean time since FNA of 6.1 years. Benign cytologic findings were reported on 439 (68%) of these patients, and only three (0.7%) had false-negative diagnoses. The false-positive rate was 0% for the 24 (4%) patients with positive aspirates. FNA is a safe, reliable, effective means of accurately discriminating benign from malignant thyroid lesions.\r"

During the period 1980 through January 1989, 22 patients underwent combined cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism and treatment of renal or ureteral stones with a single general anesthetic at our institution. This study demonstrates that this approach can be performed safely with a high success rate and negligible morbidity and that this approach may have cost-effective implications.\r"

Models that use transplants of supernumerary parathyroid (PT) glands or chronic parathyroid hormone (PTH) infusion are not ideal for many reasons. We report a new animal model in which athymic nude mice were used as recipients of human PT tissue heterografts. Three groups received 14, six, or one piece of PT adenoma tissue, and one group received six pieces of normal PT tissue. The significantly higher PTH levels in mice that received adenoma heterografts versus those with similar amounts of normal tissue suggest that adenomatous tissue is functionally distinct. A dose-response relationship between induction of hypercalcemia and the number of pieces implanted was in evidence, although only a small percentage of the mice with high PTH levels developed hypercalcemia. This differential response could be the result of any of several factors: (1) loss of ability to secrete bioactive PTH, (2) differing secretion rates among donor adenomas, (3) variability in host responsiveness to human PTH, and (4) requirement of additional factor(s) to generate consistently the hypercalcemia characteristic of human primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The findings in 10 non-smokers with asthma uncomplicated by other airway disease examined at the time of an exacerbation with sputum (group 2) were compared with those from eight smokers with chronic cough and sputum but no features of asthma (group 3). Sputum plugs were selected by microscopy to ensure their origin from the lower respiratory tract. A total cell count was performed on a trypsinised suspension, and differential and metachromatic cell counts were performed on undiluted plugs. The within specimen and test-retest reproducibility of these measurements was high (reliability coefficient, R, = 0.99 and 0.89). The sputum of the asthmatic patients was characterised by eosinophilia (69%, range 46-92%) and the presence of formaldehyde blockable metachromatic cells (1.5%, range 0.6-2.8%). In comparison, the sputum of the patients with chronic bronchitis had few eosinophils (0.5%) or metachromatic cells (0.14%); the dominant cell type was the macrophage (83%). It is concluded that sputum cell counts are reproducible in the short term, the inflammation of asthma is characterised by eosinophilia and metachromatic cells in sputum, and sputum may provide a useful source of cells for investigating the cellular characteristics of airway inflammation.\r"

The radionuclide technetium-99m (99mTc) was added to sodium cromoglycate in a canister (Intal inhaler; 1 mg/puff); in vitro studies with a multistage liquid impinger showed that the radiolabel acted as a marker for the presence of drug over a wide range of particle sizes. Ten healthy volunteers were studied after they had inhaled from (1) a metered dose inhaler alone (slow inhaled flow rate, about 25 l/min); (2) metered dose inhaler plus spacer (slow flow rate); and (3) metered dose inhaler plus spacer (fast inhaled flow rate, about 100 l/min). Inhalation was coordinated with firing the spray and was followed by 10 seconds' breath holding. With the metered dose inhaler alone a mean 11.0% (SEM 1.4%) of the dose reached the lungs, compared with significantly higher doses for slow (16.1% (2.2%] and fast (13.3% (1.7%] inhalations through the spacer. The distribution pattern within the lungs was significantly more peripheral after slow inhalation. Oropharyngeal deposition was halved by the spacer. The open spacer should teach patients good coordination and delivers more aerosol to the lungs than a correctly used metered dose inhaler.\r"

In one case recovery followed discontinuation of acebutolol; in the other case cessation of amiodarone had no effect, and corticosteroids were required. In addition to these patients, several cases of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia have been reported during treatment with gold salts, amiodarone, and miscellaneous other drugs. Taken together, this information supports the view that bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia may be a form of response by the lungs to insult by drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of an acute, artificially simulated increase in body weight on exercise performance were examined in 14 patients of normal weight (mean (SD) body mass index 22.3 (2.7)), age 61 (8) years) with chronic obstructive airways disease (FEV1 1.2 (0.5) 1; vital capacity (VC) 2.9 (0.6) 1), and in six normal subjects with similar age and sex distribution. The patients performed a six minute walking test and a symptom limited step climbing test both with and without an additional 10 kg weight (two leaded aprons). The normal subjects performed a step test with and without the additional weight. Ventilation (VE) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured during step climbing. Resting spirometric values were not altered by the additional weight. In the patients the median number of steps climbed fell from 67.5 when they were unweighted to 44.5 when they were weighted. Mean VE and VO2 were increased during weighted step climbing by 14% and 13% but the maximum levels of VE and VO2 achieved were similar during unweighted and weighted exercise (VE 36.8 (8.6) and 37.3 (10.2) 1 min-1, VO2 1.35 (0.3) and 1.41 (0.4) 1 min-1 respectively). The normal subjects were readily able to complete 150 steps both with and without the additional weight. In the patients the six minute walking distance fell only slightly with the extra weight, from 554 (SD 61) to 540 (62) m. A subsidiary study was carried out in six healthy younger subjects in which VE and VO2 were measured during a 5.6 km/h six minute treadmill walk at zero incline. The additional weight did not alter VE or VO2 during exercise. In conclusion, a small acute increase in body weight substantially worsened the already reduced \"uphill\" exercise performance in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease because of its effect on ventilation and oxygen consumption. These results suggest that modest weight loss might benefit patients with chronic obstructive airways disease even though they may be only slightly above their ideal body weight.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of current clinical practice was carried out among the 84 consultant cardiac surgeons currently performing coronary artery bypass surgery in the United Kingdom. The 80 surgeons who returned the questionnaire performed an estimated total of 17,100 coronary artery bypass graft operations in 1987, a mean case load of 214 operations each. Sixty two of the 80 surgeons regarded the internal mammary artery as the graft conduit of choice, and seven preferred the saphenous vein. The internal mammary artery was used in 73% of bypass grafts to the left anterior descending coronary artery but in only 4% of grafts to the circumflex and right coronary systems. Contraindications to the use of the internal mammary artery included advanced age of the patient (51 surgeons), insufficient flow through the internal mammary artery (49), and endarterectomy (35). Seventy four of the 80 surgeons considered intraoperative damage to the saphenous vein to be a possible cause of vein graft failure, but there was no agreement about how it should be reduced. All surgeons advocated pharmacological measures to enhance graft patency. Dipyridamole and aspirin constituted the most popular regimen (58 surgeons), though only 28 started dipyridamole preoperatively. Warfarin was prescribed postoperatively on occasion by 22 surgeons, but 14 of these used it only after endarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between pulmonary distensibility, lung volume, and elastic recoil pressure was examined in 45 patients (38 men) with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (mean age 61 (SD 14) years). Exponential analysis of static pressure-volume data obtained during deflation of the lungs gave the exponent K, an index of the distensibility of the remaining inflatable lung tissue. Total lung capacity (TLC) was measured in a body plethysmograph or by nitrogen washout. The results were compared with values obtained in 147 healthy subjects (95 men), of mean age 39 (SD 16) years. Fibrosing alveolitis decreased K by 0.62 (SEM 0.04) kPa-1. This decrease was approximately equal to 2 SD of the regression of log K on age in healthy subjects. TLC was decreased to a mean of 70% (SD 14%) predicted in the patients with fibrosing alveolitis. Lung recoil pressure at maximum inspiration was about twice the expected value and regression analysis showed that most of this increase was related to the decreased K rather than to the decreased TLC. In the men with fibrosing alveolitis the regression of height standardised TLC (TLC/Ht3) on K was significant (p less than 0.02); the regression slope was similar to that for 95 healthy men, but was displaced to a smaller lung volume. The dependence of TLC/Ht3 on K is consistent with the close relation between K and peripheral airspace size found in normal lungs. In fibrosing alveolitis decreased pulmonary distensibility probably reflects a decrease in airspace size, whereas most of the decrease in lung volume reflects the loss of inflatable tissue in the fibrotic process.\r"

The mean follow up period was 25 (range 13-37) months. No patient was having corticosteroid treatment at the time of initial bronchoalveolar lavage. \"High intensity alveolitis\" (lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 28%) was present at the initial lavage in 42 patients. These patients showed a significant improvement in their pulmonary function and chest radiographs over the follow up period whereas patients with \"low intensity alveolitis\" did not. Of the 42 patients with high intensity alveolitis, 31 had chronic sarcoidosis (duration over two years, mean 80 months). These patients showed a significant improvement in FVC but not in TLCO. Corticosteroids resulted in greater functional and radiological improvement in the patients with high intensity alveolitis than in those with low intensity alveolitis. Repeat bronchoalveolar lavage in 34 patients, mean 8.4 months after the original lavage, showed a weak inverse relation between a reduced lymphocyte count and change in forced vital capacity and isotope uptake on a gallium scan. These correlations were too weak to make repeated cell counts useful in management. Our results suggest that high intensity alveolitis may be a favourable prognostic factor for lung function in pulmonary sarcoidosis, even in patients with chronic disease, but that repeat lavage adds little to the management of the individual patient.\r"

CMV infection was diagnosed on the basis of IgM and IgG antibody responses to CMV late antigen (CMV-LA). Before cytoreductive therapy for their underlying disease, 59 patients were CMV seronegative and 91 were CMV seropositive. None of the 59 CMV-seronegative patients showed persistent seroconversion 2 months after the cytoreductive treatment. The comparison group, consisting of 312 cardiac surgery patients, showed a significantly higher incidence of primary CMV infections: 10 of 86 (11.6%, p = 0.004). Twenty-five percent of the CMV-seronegative patients and controls had transient IgG antibodies to CMV-LA without IgM antibodies, which is indicative of antibodies passively acquired via blood products. These results indicate that white cell-poor blood products carry a very low risk, if any, of CMV transmission. The policy of transfusing white cell-poor blood products provides a useful alternative to the selection of CMV-seronegative donors.\r"

Yields in excess of 75 percent of intramolecularly crosslinked (bis-PL)P4Hb have been obtained using stoichiometric amounts of the crosslinking reagent. Some functional properties of (bis-PL)P4Hb have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Oxygen affinity was substantially reduced (p50 = 31 torr at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, pCO2 = 40 torr), while the Bohr coefficient was -0.27 of H+ per mol of O2. Owing to its right-shifted dissociation curve, (bis-PL)P4Hb still yielded a p50 of 15 torr at a low temperature (16 degrees C), as compared with only 3 torr for normal adult Hb (HbA). Clearance of (bis-PL)P4Hb from plasma was significantly delayed (t1/2 = 171 min, at a dose of 0.2 g/kg of body weight compared with that of HbA (t1/2 = 54 min). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and respiration remained stable or returned to normal values within hours after bolus injection of the hemoglobin. The (bis-PL)P4Hb was not excreted in the urine, in contrast to HbA (21% of the total dose of HbA appeared in the urine within the first 2 hrs). These results show that the covalent beta-beta crosslink prevents the renal excretion of (bis-PL)P4Hb, thereby significantly prolonging vascular retention. These properties, together with an increased ability to unload O2, make (bis-PL)P4Hb a promising new candidate as a red cell substitute.\r"

The method was validated by correlating the PI-determined WBC concentrations with those determined with Coulter S-plus IV counter in units of packed red cells (PRBCs) or random-donor platelets (RDPs). The correlations were linear and had coefficients of 0.99. The sensitivity of PI staining permitted the detection of concentrations of WBCs as low as 1 cell per microL of RDPs or 11 cells per microL of PRBCs. Therefore, PI staining will be useful in investigating the role of transfused WBC-depleted blood components in the prevention of primary alloimmunization to HLA antigens, as well in evaluating various new procedures with high efficiency in depleting WBCs from blood components.\r"

During 6 days of storage, there were similar changes in all variables with one exception: the extracellular activity of adenylate kinase was lower in apheresis platelets with plasma than in the other three groups (p less than 0.01). In vivo studies were carried out with 111Indium-labeled autologous platelets in eight volunteers. Apheresis platelets with 100 mL of plasma added were stored in two 1000-mL containers (PL-732) at 22 degrees C during agitation. Platelets from one of the containers were labeled with 111Indium and transfused into the volunteer within 24 hours. Platelets from the other container were labeled after 5 days of storage and transfused into the same donor. There were no significant differences between apheresis platelets stored for 1 day and those stored for 5 days: the mean percentage of recovery was 58.4 and 57.6 percent, t1/2 was 69 and 67 hours, and the survival time was 5.5 and 5.6 days, respectively.\r"

Similarly donor-specific transfusion results in a reduction in the proliferative response of lymph node (LN) white cells (WBCs) to donor-specific stimulators in mixed-lymphocyte culture (MLC). To determine the relative roles of major and minor histocompatibility antigens in the depression of the proliferative response, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays were performed using congenic rat strains as blood donors. Unidirectional MLCs were set up between haplotype-disparate responder and stimulator LN cells, in cases in which the responding cells had been harvested from rats transfused with blood that shared either some, all, or none of the major histocompatibility complex genes with the stimulator strain. The proliferative response of LN cells harvested from rats transfused with blood sharing major (class I or II) or minor antigens, or both, with the in vitro stimulator cells was significantly less than the response of cells harvested from nontransfused controls. No single-locus product was more or less effective than whole blood in depressing cell proliferation. These data suggest that the beneficial effect of preoperative random blood transfusions observed in clinical transplantation may arise from the fortuitous sharing by the blood donor and the subsequent organ donor of not only a single major histocompatibility antigen but also of minor histocompatibility antigens.\r"

Analysis of the red blood cell (RBC) mass content of these blood units revealed that HB contained 13 percent more RBC than AB: 200 +/- 1.1 vs 177.1 +/- 1.1 mL, (m +/- SE), respectively (p less than 0.05). Of 174 AB units eligible for crossover by AABB criteria for RBC mass (greater than or equal to 154 mL), 35 (20%) were below the 95 percent confidence interval range for RBC mass of HB units collected; mean RBC mass of 300 HB units was 12 percent greater than that of 174 AB units (200.1 +/- 1.1 vs 178.9 +/- 0.9 mL, p less than 0.001) and 20 percent greater than that of the 35 AB units outside the 95 percent confidence interval (200.1 +/- 1.1 vs 161.2 +/- 0.5 mL, p less than 0.001). These findings indicate that an evaluation of the issues of AB crossover for HB transfusion should include a risk/benefit analysis of AB units with lower RBC mass. These findings also indicate that the proposed changes in AABB standards regarding directed donation (DD) should consider the reduced benefits of DD units with lower RBC mass in a risk/benefit analysis of this practice, and support retention of homologous donor standards for directed donors.\r"

In series 1, the patients (n = 13) received 2 or more injections of autologous, cryopreserved, irradiated tumor cells directly into the lymphatic system through the cannulation of a dorsal pedal lymphatic channel. In series 2, the patients (n = 7) received low-dose cyclophosphamide, 300 mg per m2, 3 days before the autologous cell vaccine was administered. Series 3 (12 patients) was similar to series 2 except that the tumor cells were treated with cholesteryl hemisuccinate immediately before irradiation. Patients received from 2 to 6 injections of cells, depending on availability, at 2-week intervals. In all, 91 treatments are evaluated in this study. Clinical responses occurred in 7 of the 32 patients and were seen in all 3 series with about the same frequency. These responses occurred in cases of melanoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, and sarcoma. Regressions occurred in both visceral and subcutaneous sites. There was little toxicity, the chief side effect being local discomfort or inflammation. This experience indicates that active specific intralymphatic immunotherapy is safe, produces antitumor effects, and requires more investigation to increase the frequency and duration of observable tumor regression.\r"

These physicians were matched with a comparison group by age, specialty, and practice location. We found that a mean of one malpractice claim had been filed against each physician in our study, with the specialties of obstetrics and gynecology, neurosurgery, and orthopedics having the most claims. A significantly higher mean number of malpractice claims had been filed against 31 physicians disciplined by the board. Our study suggests a role for state regulatory boards in the malpractice area. We propose that such bodies do practice reviews based on the convergence of two events, a disciplinary action such as those described in this article and the filing of more than one malpractice claim against a physician. Further research is needed on inappropriate prescribing by physicians and its possible association with malpractice.\r"

We reviewed all gastric antral biopsy specimens from children (n = 30) and adults (n = 77) over the past 5 years at the University of California, San Francisco. Tissue sections were stained with Giemsa to detect C pylori, and medical histories were obtained by chart review. The prevalence of C pylori in antral biopsy specimens with gastritis increased from 22% during the period 1983 to 1986 to 66% in 1987 (P less than .001). In all specimens showing gastritis, C pylori appeared more frequently in adults (31/67 [46%]) than in children (4/17 [24%]). In cases with primary gastritis, however, the prevalence of C pylori reversed to 57% (4/7) in children versus 49% (31/63) in adults. Most children (10/13) with gastritis and no C pylori had predisposing conditions. Infection with this organism was associated with more active inflammatory changes in adults than in children, but it may contribute to most cases of hitherto-unexplained gastritis in children. Further studies are needed to determine whether the prevalence of C pylori is increasing.\r"

Three of the four patients had adult T-cell leukemia, an aggressive neoplasm resulting from HTLV-I infection, while the other was an asymptomatic carrier of HTLV-I. Three of the patients had spent their childhoods in an endemic location for both organisms, suggesting an initial infection at that time. Three patients were symptomatic from their parasitism. We conclude that strongyloidiasis may be found in nonendemic locations in patients with either adult T-cell leukemia or an asymptomatic HTLV-I carrier state. Whether infestation with this parasite contributes to the leukemogenesis of HTLV-I, as postulated by others, cannot at this time be determined.\r"

A greater emphasis on outpatient care and the use of new therapies that increase life expectancy by reducing the frequency and severity of morbidity will decrease the future annual cost of treatment but will have a small effect on total economic costs because of substantial foregone earnings by persons with AIDS. Estimating the economic impact of this disease provides valuable information for formulating effective strategies to treat AIDS patients, to provide education for limiting the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, and to achieve other health objectives.\r"

Data on all 4,243 indigent patients admitted over 2 fiscal years (1985 and 1986) under the county medical services program of San Diego County, California, revealed 5.3% (226) to be homeless. The commonest major diagnostic category among the homeless discharges was \"diseases and disorders of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and breast,\" constituting 21.2% as compared with only 8.7% of the discharge diagnoses for housed indigent persons. Within this major diagnostic category, the predominant diagnosis-related group was cellulitis, accounting for 12.8% of diagnoses in the homeless and only 4.0% of discharge diagnoses in other medically indigent persons. A homeless housing status was also correlated with a higher percentage of discharges with the major diagnostic category of \"substance use and substance-induced organic mental disorders\" but was negatively correlated with that of \"diseases and disorders of the circulatory system.\"\r"

Five-year event-free survival (freedom from myocardial infarction, bypass grafting, angioplasty, and death) was 93% for surgical patients and 62% for angioplasty patients.

Twenty consecutive patients with ventricularization were identified prospectively in our laboratory. Four patients had a discrete ostial left main stenosis and 16 patients had stenosis of the entire length of the left main coronary artery. The degree of pressure drop upon cannulation of the diseased left main coronary artery was highly variable; the systolic pressure decreased by 9 to 94 mm Hg, and the diastolic pressure decreased by 6 to 60 mm Hg. The morphology of the ventricularized pressure was distinct. It had a presystolic deflection resembling an a wave. The upstroke of this waveform was slower and the downstroke was steeper than that of the aortic pressure. An identical waveform was observed in dogs after partial occlusion of the left main coronary artery with a balloon-tipped catheter. The waveform of the so-called ventricularized pressure is derived from the aortic pressure, which is altered by its transmission across the left main coronary stenosis. The appearance of ventricularization is an important clue to the presence of left main coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary angiography permits identification of stenotic lesions but underestimates their severity and does not provide information regarding their physiologic significance. Evaluation of coronary flow reserve by means of selective coronary artery Doppler flow catheters or quantitative arteriography has been proposed to obtain this information. However, these techniques may not accurately reflect transmural gradients in flow. We evaluated the relationship between flow reserve defined with an epicardial Doppler flow probe and the transmural gradient of flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres in 21 dogs with graded stenoses and correlated results with coronary artery geometry measured morphometrically. Four groups of dogs were studied. In five control dogs without stenosis, reactive hyperemia after 20 seconds of complete coronary occlusion was 4.5 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SD) times resting flow with an endocardial/epicardial flow ratio at peak flow of 1.0 +/- 0.2. When reactive hyperemia was blunted (without affecting resting flow) by 50% (n = 6), 75% (n = 5), or was abolished completely (n = 5) by coronary stenosis, the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio at peak flow was 1.0 +/- 0.3, 0.7 +/- 0.2, and 0.5 +/- 0.1, respectively. Cross-sectional area of the stenosed segment was reduced by 85.6 +/- 3.5%, 91.1 +/- 2.2%, and 92.8 +/- 4.3% in these groups, respectively. Thus in dogs with stenoses exceeding 86% of the cross-sectional area, endocardial flow reserve is compromised disproportionately compared with epicardial flow reserve, suggesting that clinical measurements of coronary flow reserve may underestimate the physiologic significance of coronary stenoses.\r"

These patients were also evaluated for ventricular performance, residual mitral regurgitation, and wall integrity. Early in our experience with reimplantation, two patients died while we waited for them to achieve a more favorable size for surgery. Eight of nine survived reimplantation; three of these were under 1 year of age when operated upon. One of these eight patients has required additional mitral valvuloplasty, but all are doing well clinically up to 12 years after operation. Preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.37 +/- 0.16 increased to 0.67 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.001) by 1 year after surgery, despite ventricular wall abnormalities in four patients. Thus reimplantation of the anomalous left coronary artery should be undertaken upon diagnosis, since surgery can be performed successfully in infancy, with resultant improvement in ventricular function and an adequate clinical condition for at least 12 years.\r"

Autopsies were performed in 56% of in-hospital deaths and 27% of patients dead on arrival in the emergency room (out-of-hospital deaths). In 271 cases of suspected cardiac death, a myocardial infarction of any age was identified. Death had occurred in the acute phase of a first infarction in 19 patients and was most frequently due to pump failure (37%) followed by cardiac rupture (26%) and arrhythmias (21%). Death had occurred 24 hours to 3 weeks after a first infarction in 80 patients and was most frequently due to pump failure (44%), rupture (27%), and arrhythmias (16%). Recurrent acute infarction was found in 32% of patients whose deaths were due to arrhythmias or pump failure and in 19% of those whose deaths were due to rupture. Death had occurred greater than 3 weeks after a first infarction in 172 patients. In 132 (77%) of these patients death was due to a complication of a new acute or recent infarction. Myocardial rupture was a less frequent cause of death in patients with recurrent infarction (8%) than in those dying in the acute or early phase after their first infarction (27%, p = 0.0009). A primary arrhythmia in the absence of recurrent infarction or ischemia accounted for only 14% of out-of-hospital deaths late after an infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac hypertrophy was found in 84%. The anterior papillary muscle was involved in four cases, the posterior in 13, and both muscles in eight. Left ventricular subendocardial infarction was found in 32% of cases. The size of left ventricular necrosis ranged from 11% to 75% of the left ventricular mass. Associated right ventricular infarction was observed in 68%. There were 19 cases of cardiogenic shock, four cases of pulmonary edema, and two cases of sudden death. We conclude that papillary muscle necrosis is usually associated with cardiac hypertrophy, posterior necrosis of both ventricles, and subendocardial infarction. Acute mitral regurgitation is probably an important contributing factor to clinical impairment and death, mostly in cases of small necrosis.\r"

Heart rate on electrocardiogram or Holter monitor did not clearly distinguish this subgroup. The presence of alternate \"risk factors,\" such as atrial enlargement seen on electrocardiogram, cardiomegaly seen on x-ray film, or prolonged QT interval were independent predictors of symptoms and poor outcome (p less than 0.05). Ventricular ectopy determined on Holter monitoring was also common among the symptomatic group, although this finding was inconsistent. Prophylactic pacing is indicated in select patients with congenital complete heart block and otherwise normal anatomy. Surveillance for rick factors beyond rate criteria alone may refine this selection process.\r"

To determine whether prolonged, strenuous activity is associated with the development of ventricular late potentials, signal-averaged electrocardiography was performed on 30 marathon runners before, immediately after, and during a recovery period at least 1 week after they had a 26.2-mile race. The filtered QRS duration decreased immediately after the marathon to 94.4 +/- 10.0 msec from baseline values of 97.3 +/- 10.1 msec (p less than 0.005). Root mean square energy in the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex increased immediately after the race from 60.4 +/- 35.6 uV to 71.0 +/- 41.7 uV (P less than 0.5). The duration of signals less than 40 uV in the terminal QRS were not appreciably altered. At the 1-week follow-up study, all parameters closely approximated the baseline values. No runner had a late potential after running the race. The one runner with a late potential at baseline had normal parameters immediately after the race. We conclude that signal-averaged ECG parameters are improved after a marathon is run, and the risk of an arrhythmic sudden death in adult runners without organic heart disease would seem to be low.\r"

Four patients had a family history of heart disease. Basic ECGs showed sinus rhythm in all of them. PR interval was prolonged in one. Two patients had complete and one had incomplete right bundle branch block. One patient had inverted t waves in V1-3 and late potentials. Three had an upsloping ST-T segment elevation in V1-2. The cardiothoracic index was less than 0.5 in five and 0.50 in one. In one of the five patients studied, the clinical episode of ventricular fibrillation was reproduced by stimulation of the right ventricular outflow tract during electrophysiologic study. Results of cross-sectional echocardiography and angiography showed predominantly structural and wall motion abnormalities of the right ventricle in five patients and slight wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle in two. Two patients also had mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse. Coronary arteries were normal in all five patients examined. Results of endomyocardial biopsy showed no abnormalities in one patient, fibrosis in two, and fibrolipomatosis in one. Two patients died during follow-up: autopsy was performed in one and results showed right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Thus in five of these selected patients with apparent idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, some abnormalities, predominantly of the right ventricle, were documented only after detailed investigation; however, clinical history and some nonspecific ECG abnormalities were factors in the diagnostic procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Diltiazem may provide a protective effect to ischemic and reperfused myocardium through preservation of high-energy phosphate metabolism. To test this hypothesis, rabbits had a 1.3 cm solenoidal coil placed over the myocardium to be rendered ischemic. Data were acquired with a 22 cm bore nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer at 2.0 T. Animals were treated with diltiazem (200 micrograms/kg intravenous bolus of drug followed by a 15 micrograms/kg/min continuous intravenous infusion, n = 10) or by an equal volume of saline (n = 6). The left circumflex artery was occluded and reperfused using a reversible snare while electrocardiogram-gated spectra were accumulated. Levels of phosphocreatine were decreased during occlusion in both groups; however, this decrease was attenuated in the diltiazem treated animals compared to control (in relative percent area: 7.8 +/- 1.0 to 2.5 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.01). Levels of phosphocreatine promptly returned to baseline following reperfusion and there was no difference between the two groups. The inorganic phosphate metabolites of high-energy phosphate consumption increased with occlusion, though more so in the control group compared with the diltiazem-treated rabbits (in relative percent area: 72.5 +/- 0.9 to 55.4 +/- 1.3, p less than 0.01). With reperfusion, levels of inorganic phosphates returned toward baseline in both groups; however, the diltiazem group had a more complete recovery relative to control (in relative percent area: 38.8 +/- 2.1 to 47.6 +/- 2.7, p less than 0.05). Levels of adenosine triphosphate decreased in both groups relative to baseline; however, the amount of decrease was similar in the two groups. With reperfusion there was a definite though incomplete recovery of levels of adenosine triphosphate in the diltiazem-treated group (in relative percent area: 10.7 +/- 1.0 at occlusion, 12.3 +/- 0.4 during reperfusion, p less than 0.05), but in the control group levels of adenosine triphosphate remained depressed (in relative percent area: 9.8 +/- 0.6 at occlusion, 9.8 +/- 0.8 during reperfusion, p = NS). During ischemia there was a trend toward attenuation of intracellular acidosis in the diltiazem group; however, this trend did not reach statistical significance. These data indicate that diltiazem provides a protective effect on myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism during regional ischemia and reperfusion in the intact animal.\r"

The positive inotropic agents that augment intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (dibutyryl cAMP, amrinone, and isoproterenol) caused an increase in developed pressure and [Ca2+]i transients and a decrease in diastolic [Ca2+]i. On the other hand, the glycoside digoxin and the alpha-adrenoceptor agents, phenylephrine and dobutamine, also caused an increase in [Ca2+]i transients and developed pressure. However, unlike the agents that increase [cAMP]i, they induced an elevation in diastolic [Ca2+]i. With all the positive inotropic agents, developed pressure increased commensurately with the percentage changes in amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transients.\r"

These results were compared to perfusion of the heart with 10(-6) mol/L norepinephrine and 10(-6) mol/L isoproterenol. With the positive inotropic agents the rate-pressure product increased immediately (p less than 0.01 with dobutamine, norepinephrine; p less than 0.003 with isoproterenol); after 10 to 15 minutes of perfusion the rate-pressure product remained relatively stable with norepinephrine and isoproterenol but decreased with dobutamine (p = NS vs control values). [Ca2+]i-transients increased significantly in all groups. The end-diastolic [Ca2+]i decreased continuously with norepinephrine and isoproterenol (p less than 0.008; p less than 0.005) but increased during dobutamine by 19%. Alterations in coronary flow, pHi, high-energy phosphates, and the phosphorylation potential were not significantly different among the three catecholamines. In conclusion, in contrast to norepinephrine and isoproterenol, dobutamine depressed myocardial performance and increased end-diastolic [Ca2+]i in late heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Aortic compliance is a major determinant of systolic blood pressure and of impedance to left ventricular ejection. However, little is known about its regulating factors. To assess the effects of preload and adrenergic activity on aortic compliance, we studied 10 normal subjects and nine untreated hypertensive patients at rest and during lower body negative pressure. Aortic compliance was measured invasively from the diastolic decay of the aortic pressure tracing and systemic vascular resistance. Preload was decreased stepwise by lower body negative pressure (-5 to -40 mm Hg) while adrenergic activity was assessed by the change in plasma norepinephrine at a maximum level of negative pressure suction. At rest, aortic compliance was lower in hypertensive subjects compared with its value in normal individuals (0.048 +/- 0.012 [SD] versus 0.071 +/- 0.009 units, p less than 0.001) but correlated inversely with systolic blood pressure in both groups (r = -0.64 in normotensive individuals, r = -0.83 in hypertensive subjects, r = -0.88 for the whole group, p less than 0.001 for all). Whereas resting pulmonary wedge pressure was higher in hypertensive subjects compared with normal individuals (16 +/- 4 [SD] versus 11 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), resting plasma norepinephrine levels were not different between the two groups (261 +/- 139 versus 251 +/- 103 pg/ml). Neither of these two resting indices correlated with baseline aortic compliance in both normotensive individuals and hypertensive patients. During lower body negative pressure (LBNP), cardiac filling pressure (right atrial pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure) as well as cardiac output decreased in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was designed to establish the relative responsiveness of maximum time-varying elastance (Emax) slope values to alterations in left ventricular contractile state in comparison with isovolumic and ejection phase indices in man. Accordingly, nine patients had a bipolar right atrial pacing catheter and micromanometer left ventricular catheter placed and red blood cells tagged with technetium-99m for radionuclide angiography. Hemodynamic measurements and radionuclide angiograms were acquired simultaneously over a range of loading conditions produced by methoxamine or nitroprusside infusions during both the basal and enhanced contractile states. Enhanced left ventricular contractility was produced by a steady-state dobutamine infusion of 2 to 10 mu/kg/min. The mean (+)dP/dtmax increased from 1510 +/- 460 mm Hg/sec during the basal state to 2537 +/- 546 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.001) during the dobutamine infusion. The mean Emax slope value also increased from 4.34 +/- 1.40 mm Hg/ml during the basal state to 6.41 +/- 1.90 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.001) during the dobutamine infusion. The average percent change in the Emax slope value (51 +/- 26%) was less than those for the isovolumic indices (57% to 112%), while it was more than those for the ejection phase indices (11% to 53%). When the variability in the percent changes for each of these contractile indices was incorporated into the analysis, the Emax slope values demonstrated a greater responsiveness to changes in left ventricular contractility than did the isovolumic and ejection phase indices. In conclusion, the Emax slope value calculated by this method is a contractile index, which is less affected by measurement variability and the influences of loading conditions than are the isovolumic and ejection phase indices, and therefore may improve our ability to both detect and quantitate changes in left ventricular contractility in man.\r"

Successful angioplasty of the infarct vessel was achieved in 94% of patients. The overall in-hospital mortality was 7.2%. Cardiogenic shock, 3-vessel disease and failed angioplasty were the 3 strongest multivariate correlates of early mortality. Reocclusion of the infarct-vessel was noted in 47 (15%) of the 307 patients with angiographic follow-up before hospital discharge. Significant bleeding complications occurred in only 3% of patients; stroke or myocardial rupture was not seen. The global ejection fraction increased from 53% on the preangioplasty ventriculograms to 59% at 1 week (p less than 0.001). Significant regional wall motion improvement in the infarct segments was noted in 53% of patients. Global ejection fraction improved most dramatically in patients presenting with baseline ejection fractions less than or equal to 45% (increasing from 36 to 50%). The 1- and 5-year survival rates after hospital discharge were 95 and 84%, respectively. The 1-year reinfarction rate was 3%. Thus, direct coronary angioplasty was highly effective in reestablishing infarct-vessel patency and salvaging ischemic myocardium, resulting in low in-hospital and long-term mortality.\r"

Of these, 65 patients were classified as having had an anterior non-Q-wave AMI, defined as new ST- or T-wave changes, or both, in leads V1 through V4 (group 1). The remaining 70 patients were classified as having had inferior or lateral non-Q-wave AMI, or both, defined as ST- or T-wave changes in 2 consecutive leads (II, II aVF; II and aVL or V5 and V6) (group 2). At baseline group I was older and had a higher incidence of previous AMI than group 2. After adjusting for baseline variables, the patients in group I had a 29% reinfarction and 32% mortality rate, which was significantly higher (p less than 0.002 for both) when compared to group 2, which had a reinfarction and mortality rate of 8 and 9%, respectively. Patients with anterior non-Q-wave AMI are at very high risk for developing a major cardiac event very soon after the index AMI. This high risk is probably related to a larger area of residual ischemic but viable myocardium in the infarct-related artery when compared to inferolateral non-Q-wave AMI.\r"

The finding of any redistribution on dipyridamole-thallium scanning was common (77%) in these patients and had poor specificity (29%). Redistribution outside of the infarct zone, however, had equivalent sensitivity (63%) and better specificity (75%) for events (p less than 0.05). Both predischarge dipyridamole-thallium and submaximal exercise electrocardiography identified 5 of the 8 events (p = 0.04 and 0.07, respectively). The negative predictive accuracy for events for both dipyridamole-thallium and submaximal exercise electrocardiography was 88%. In addition to the 8 patients with events, 16 other patients had severe ischemic potential (6 had coronary bypass surgery, 1 had inoperable 3-vessel disease and 9 had markedly abnormal 6-week maximal exercise tests). Predischarge dipyridamole-thallium and submaximal exercise testing also identified 8 and 7 of these 16 patients with severe ischemic potential, respectively. Six of the 8 cardiac events occurred before 6-week follow-up. A maximal exercise thallium test at 6 weeks identified 1 of the 2 additional events within 6 months correctly. Thallium redistribution after dipyridamole in coronary territories outside the infarct zone is a sensitive and specific predictor of subsequent cardiac events and identifies patients with severe ischemic potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous transluminal coronary excimer laser angioplasty was performed in 15 patients using a 1.3-mm diameter laser catheter. The catheter consists of 20 concentric quartz fibers of 100 microns diameter each located around a central lumen suitable for a 0.014-inch flexible guidewire. The catheter was coupled to an excimer laser delivering energy at a wavelength of 308 nm and at a pulsewidth of 60 ns. Quantitative analysis of the angiograms documented a decrease from 77 +/- 15% diameter stenosis before intervention to 40 +/- 22% after the first irradiation cycle and to 21 +/- 17% after termination of laser ablation. The minimal lumen diameter increased from 0.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.3 +/- 0.4 and to 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. Vessel reocclusion was seen in 2 patients at 24-hour control angiography. No procedure-related major complications such as vessel perforation occurred. In 8 patients, however, intraluminal lucencies were seen, which were persistently visualized 24 hours after intervention in 6 patients. Despite pretreatment with intracoronary nitroglycerin, coronary spasm occurred in 8 patients and was reversible after additional sublingual vasodilator therapy. The results of this pilot study suggest that percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty is feasible and effective for ablation of coronary lesions in selected patients and can be performed without subsequent conventional balloon angioplasty. The clinical impact of this new interventional technique, however, remains to be assessed.\r"

Thirty-five men and 16 women, mean age 63 years, with Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III angina (23 patients) or class IV (28 patients) were studied. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 45 (88%), bypass surgery in 14 (27%) and congestive heart failure in 17 (33%). Forty-six (90%) had impaired left ventricular function. Twenty (39%) had an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 25%. Left main stenosis was present in 9 (18%), 3-vessel disease in 48 (94%) and 2-vessel disease in 2 (4%). Twenty (39%) were considered at a prohibitive risk for bypass surgery (14 were turned down for surgery). Bypass was instituted percutaneously with flows ranging from 2 to 5 liters/min (mean 3.6). Angioplasty was successful in 115 of the 117 lesions attempted with the culprit vessel dilated in all. Dilatation of the only remaining vessel was performed in 14 (27%). Inflation times up to 10 minutes were well tolerated. Bypass was discontinued after a mean bypass time of 37 minutes. Hemostasis was achieved by external clamp compression in 50. There were 3 hospital deaths unrelated to bypass. Patient follow-up at 2 to 8 months (mean 4.9) disclosed 1 late death, 31 (66%) asymptomatic patients, 12 (26%) patients in class I and 4 patients (9%) in class II. Thus, this study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of percutaneous bypass support in selected patients undergoing high-risk coronary angioplasty.\r"

To determine success rate and assess clinical and angiographic variables associated with success and complications, 57 total occlusions in 56 patients undergoing PTCA were analyzed. The clinical duration of occlusion was 51 +/- 86 days. Success (less than 50% residual stenosis) was achieved at 40 of 57 (70%) dilatation sites.

  ".W": "To determine the safety and efficacy of early hospital discharge after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 100 patients were studied prospectively. A telemetry observation unit was established to monitor patients having uncomplicated procedures. A total of 170 lesions were dilated, with a procedural success rate of 96% and a clinical success rate of 91%. There were no deaths or patients who required emergency bypass surgery. Four patients developed abrupt vessel closure in the catheterization laboratory. No major complications developed in the telemetry observation unit or after discharge. Patients with high-risk lesion morphology, based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force guidelines, tended to have a lower success rate and more procedural complications. Coronary dissections were angiographically detected in 33 patients and stratified into 6 types. To reduce possible adverse sequelae, all patients with complex dissections were triaged in the catheterization laboratory to an in-patient monitored unit for additional management. Accordingly, 20 patients were admitted to an in-patient unit for extended observation. Excluding 4 patients with myocardial infarction, 75% (12 of 16) were discharged the next day. Initial experience with early discharge suggests that under proper conditions the procedure is safe and effective. Patients with complex coronary dissections who are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure can be promptly identified after dilatation and triaged to an appropriate monitoring area. Early discharge after PTCA offers more efficient use of hospital facilities and the opportunity to reduce hospital costs.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac complications represent a major risk to patients undergoing vascular surgery. Diabetic patients may be particularly prone to such complications due to the high incidence of concomitant coronary artery disease, the severity of which may be clinically unrecognized. Attempts to stratify groups by clinical criteria have been useful but lack the predictive value of currently used noninvasive techniques such as dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy. One hundred one diabetic patients were evaluated with dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy before undergoing vascular surgery. The incidence of thallium abnormalities was high (80%) and did not correlate with clinical markers of coronary disease. Even in a subgroup of patients with no overt clinical evidence of underlying heart disease, thallium abnormalities were present in 59%. Cardiovascular complications, however, occurred in only 11% of all patients. Statistically significant prediction of risk was not achieved with simple assessment of thallium results as normal or abnormal. Quantification of total number of reversible defects, as well as assessment of ischemia in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery was required for optimum predictive accuracy. The prevalence of dipyridamole-thallium abnormalities in a diabetic population is much higher than that reported in nondiabetic patients and cannot be predicted by usual clinical indicators of heart disease. In addition, cardiovascular risk of vascular surgery can be optimally assessed by quantitative analysis of dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy and identification of high- and low-risk subgroups.\r"

To determine whether type A CAD patients might be more likely than type B patients to have silent ischemia during exercise and consequently a worse prognosis, 403 patients with stable CAD who had significant coronary disease on angiography, a positive Bruce protocol treadmill test and a structured interview to assess type A behavior were studied. Median follow-up time was 6 years. Type A patients were more likely to experience silent ischemia during exercise than were type B patients (35 vs 25%, p = 0.05). Patients with silent ischemia during exercise had a history of fewer anginal episodes/week, and type A patients with silent ischemia were less likely to have had a history of typical angina. However, using the Cox model, there were no significant differences in survival between type A patients and B patients with silent ischemia (4-year survival 86 vs 79%, p = 0.44) and no significant differences in survival between type A patients with silent ischemia and type A patients with symptomatic ischemia (6-year survival 86 vs 80%, p = 0.59). Similar results were obtained for infarction-free survival. Type A patients are more likely than type B patients to have silent ischemia during exercise, but long-term survival is not affected.\r"

To determine whether the same criteria also predict acute ischemic heart events such as unstable angina and myocardial infarction, fatal and nonfatal acute manifestations were documented in 241 patients medically treated during an 8-year follow-up. All patients had a Bruce protocol treadmill exercise test with ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 2 mm and coronary angiographic studies. There were 52 deaths; of these 44 were due to coronary artery disease. There were 41 episodes of unstable angina and 21 myocardial infarcts documented as first morbid events. As expected, survival improved with increased workload achieved; patients terminating their exercise at stage I (5.1 METs) had an 8-year survival rate of 45 +/- 9% while those reaching stage IV or more (10 METs) had a survival rate of 93 +/- 6%. In a multivariate analysis, the duration of exercise and the number of narrowed coronary arteries and of left ventricular segment abnormalities correlated significantly with survival. In contrast, nonfatal acute events occurred in about 20 to 35% of patients whatever the stage of the exercise test. Furthermore, neither variables during the exercise test nor angiographic findings predicted nonfatal events. Thus, although the workload achieved did identify patients with different mortality rates, it failed to predict subsets of patients with different morbid event rates.\r"

A 15-W argon ion gas laser was used and pulsed laser energy was delivered through a fiberoptic catheter delivery system. Pre- and intraoperative mapping was used to localize the arrhythmogenic tissue. Postoperative clinical, ambulatory electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic evaluations were performed before discharge and at 1 year of follow-up. Thirty-eight VT morphologies were mapped and ablated with laser energy alone (82%), combined laser ablation and mechanical resection (13%) or mechanical resection alone (5%). Concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in 15 patients and in 1 patient it was performed with mitral value replacement. Postoperative 30-day mortality was 5%. One patient (5%) required postoperative antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and all survivors had suppression of inducible sustained VT at discharge. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 34 +/- 12% preoperatively to 41 +/- 13% postoperatively (p = 0.001). Efficacy rates for ablation of VT sites associated with anterior myocardial infarction and inferior or posterior myocardial infarction were comparable (100 vs 96%, respectively, p greater than 0.2). At 1-year follow-up no sudden deaths had occurred and total survival rate was 90%. Intraoperative pulsed argon laser ablation alone or in conjunction with standard surgical techniques improves the efficacy of surgical ablation procedures for VT or ventricular fibrillation and reduces the need for additional postoperative antiarrhythmic drug or device therapy.\r"

The response to propranolol was compared in 13 patients who had only stable monomorphic VTs inducible at baseline and another 11 patients who had greater than or equal to 1 episode of electrically unstable VTs (polymorphic VT, ventricular flutter or ventricular fibrillation) at baseline. Seven patients (29%) became noninducible (responders) and 17 patients (71%) remained inducible to sustained VT (nonresponders) after propranolol. The basal heart rate was faster in responders than in nonresponders (101 +/- 14 vs 86 +/- 11 beats/min, p less than 0.01). The magnitude of heart rate reduction was also greater after propranolol in responders (from 101 +/- 14 to 80 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.001) than in nonresponders (from 86 +/- 11 to 74 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.01) (p less than 0.05 between the groups), despite equal plasma propranolol concentrations (84 +/- 50 vs 88 +/- 43 ng/ml, difference not significant). Seven of 11 patients (64%) who had greater than or equal to 1 episode of unstable VTs inducible at baseline responded to intravenous propranolol, whereas none of the patients with only stable monomorphic VTs became noninducible after beta blockade (p less than 0.001). Responders had shorter cycle length of inducible VTs than nonresponders (225 +/- 38 vs 302 +/- 66 ms, p less than 0.001).

In 13 patients the diagnosis was of a reentrant tachycardia using an extranodal accessory connection (atrioventricular [AV] reentrant tachycardia); 5 of these patients had overt preexcitation in sinus rhythm, 4 had concealed accessory connections and 4 had latent or intermittent preexcitation. In 7 patients the diagnosis was of an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. Administration of adenosine resulted in termination of tachycardia in all 20 patients at a mean dose of 0.125 mg/kg (range 0.05 to 0.20). Although termination of tachycardia was frequently accompanied by atrial and ventricular premature complexes, no significant arrhythmias were observed after conversion. Administration of verapamil (0.145 mg/kg) resulted in termination of tachycardia in 19 of 20 patients but was followed by symptomatic arrhythmias in 2: preexcited atrial flutter in 1 patient and preexcited atrial tachycardia in another. Latent or intermittent preexcitation was unmasked in 4 of 4 patients immediately after termination of tachycardia by adenosine. Termination of tachycardia by verapamil revealed preexcitation in only 1 of these 4 patients. Analysis of results in terms of successful termination of tachycardia, absence of significant arrhythmias after conversion and unmasking of latent or intermittent preexcitation reveals that adenosine therapy was satisfactory in all 20 patients, whereas verapamil was satisfactory in only 14 of the 20 patients (p less than 0.05). All 6 of the patients with unsatisfactory responses to verapamil had AV reentrant tachycardia. These results suggest that adenosine has particular advantages over verapamil as acute treatment for patients presenting with an AV reentrant tachycardia.\r"

Morbidity and mortality statistics were confirmed by chart review and patient telephone interview. Of the 189 enrolled patients, 101 are alive, 84 are dead and 4 are lost to follow-up. Amiodarone-induced toxicity to the neurologic system, lungs, thyroid or liver was the primary or complicating cause of death in 12 of the 84 patients who died. The overall prevalence of all these forms of toxicity was 15%. Sixty-nine percent of the patients with amiodarone toxicity had pulmonary toxicity alone or combined with other forms of toxicity. Pulmonary function test abnormalities were noted at baseline in 75% of patients who had amiodarone-induced toxicity. The proportion of abnormal baseline pulmonary function tests was not significantly different among all toxic patients, pulmonary toxic patients and nontoxic patients. An evaluation of the decrease in pulmonary function over time could not distinguish patients who developed toxicity from those who did not. The observed incidence of pulmonary toxicity is consistent with published values; however, contrary to the findings of others, no statistically significant differences in pulmonary function at baseline or in changes over time were found between toxic and nontoxic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 21 patients studied, 17 had the common type (\"slow-fast\") and 4 had the uncommon type (\"fast-slow\") of AV node reentry. Under normothermic cardio-pulmonary bypass, perinodal dissection was performed guided by anatomic landmarks: the atrial membranous septum, posterior superior process of the left ventricle, tendon of Todaro and os of the coronary sinus. There were no deaths or major complications. Seven to 10 days postoperatively, all patients had normal AV conduction except for one who continued to have AV node Wenckebach-type block. Postoperatively, the shortest cycle length capable of 1:1 conduction over the AV node changed from 323 +/- 66 to 421 +/- 90 ms (p less than 0.0001) anterogradely and from 330 +/- 86 to 449 +/- 164 ms (p = 0.004) retrogradely. Anterograde effective refractory period of the AV node prolonged from 264 +/- 49 to 358 +/- 107 ms (p = 0.012). Discontinuous AV conduction curves were no longer seen in 14 of 17 patients and 5 patients lost retrograde conduction. During follow-up (14.8 +/- 8.2 months), 19 patients have been free of arrhythmia without medication. Two patients required a second operation for recurrent tachycardia with success. No patient required a permanent pacemaker. These data show that operative therapy of AV node reentrant tachycardia can be guided by anatomic landmarks. Successful cure of tachycardia with perinodal dissection while preserving AV node conduction supports the view that the reentrant circuit is, at least in part, perinodal.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of several proposed indirect and direct indexes of left ventricular LV) systolic performance and contractility to detect clinically important LV dysfunction was evaluated in 42 patients with refractory dilated cardiomyopathy studied with right-sided heart catheterization and M-mode echocardiography. Hemodynamic evaluation demonstrated elevated filling pressure (mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure 24 +/- 6 mm Hg) and depressed function (cardiac index 1.68 +/- 0.43 liters/min/m2). Echocardiographic LV end-diastolic dimension (7.3 +/- 1.0 cm), mass (182 +/- 60 gm/m2) and end-systolic stress (163 +/- 44 x 10(3) dynes/cm2) were increased whereas fractional shortening was depressed in all (mean 12 +/- 4%). During follow-up 88% of patients died at a median interval of 16 months after study. Indirect measurements of LV function (mitral E point-septal separation and the ratio of preejection period to LV ejection time) were abnormal in 100 and 88% of patients, respectively. Contractility was classified as depressed in 36 (86%) patients by the end-systolic stress volume index ratio and in 31 (74%) by the relation between fractional shortening and end-systolic stress. In contrast, the relation between end-systolic stress and velocity of circumferential shortening identified only 7 (17%) patients as having subnormal contractility and classified 9 (21%) as having supernormal contractility. Rate correction of velocity of circumferential shortening only modestly improved the ability of the relation to identify depressed contractility (abnormal in 16 patients or 38 percent).\r"

  ".W": "Clinical, hemodynamic and neurohumoral variables in 238 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to coronary artery disease were analyzed to determine potential predictors of mortality in a large population and to allow analysis according to mode of death (sudden or low output death). All variables were assessed before initiation of treatment with vasodilators (converting enzyme inhibitors, direct acting vasodilators) or with the nonglycoside, noncatecholamine class of inotropic agents. Survival outcome was determined as alive, sudden death or low output death. When all variables except ejection fraction were analyzed by Cox multiple regression analysis, the most important independent predictor of all deaths was the baseline plasma renin activity (p less than 0.001). When subdivided by cause of cardiovascular death, baseline plasma renin activity was retained as the most important determinant of low output death (p less than 0.001), whereas baseline left ventricular stroke work index (p less than 0.001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p less than 0.002) and absence of sinus rhythm (p less than 0.006) were the most powerful independent predictors of sudden death. Plasma norepinephrine was markedly elevated in the group dying of low output, but only modestly elevated in the group of survivors and the group dying suddenly. However, baseline norepinephrine was not found to be an important independent predictor of mortality in any of the subgroups. Plasma renin activity, but not plasma norepinephrine, is a powerful independent prognostic determinant of mortality in this group of patients with CHF.\r"

  ".W": "Superior systolic displacement of the mitral leaflets is the echocardiographic finding generally used to diagnose mitral valve prolapse, but its clinical significance is not clearly established. This study was designed to determine if the presence of leaflet thickening, displacement in the multiple imaging planes or the quantitative degree of displacement could be used to identify clinically important valvular abnormality. To this end, these findings were prospectively assessed and correlated with the presence of mitral regurgitation and ventricular arrhythmia in 49 patients with displacement and in 49 age-matched control subjects with no identifiable displacement. Both ventricular arrhythmia and mitral regurgitation were found to occur with significantly greater frequency in patients with leaflet displacement than in control subjects. However, among the patients with leaflet displacement, both these complications occurred with greater frequency in subgroups characterized by the presence of leaflet thickening, quantitatively greater displacement and displacement evident in 2 orthogonal imaging planes. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the best echocardiographic predictor of either ventricular arrhythmia or mitral regurgitation was the quantitative degree of leaflet displacement. These results indicate that most patients with echocardiographic evidence of leaflet displacement had very low incidences of ventricular arrhythmia and mitral regurgitation. Subgroups, however, could be identified echocardiographically in which both complications occurred with significantly greater frequency.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen infants and children with valvular aortic stenosis underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty over a 36-month period ending August 1988. The mean systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve decreased from 72 +/- 21 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 28 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) immediately after valvuloplasty; the degree of aortic insufficiency did not significantly increase. Follow-up catheterization (in 10 patients) and Doppler data (in all 16 patients) were available 3 to 32 months (mean 12 months) after valvuloplasty and revealed a residual aortic valvular gradient of 37 +/- 23 mm Hg, which continues to be significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than that before valvuloplasty. There was no increase in aortic insufficiency. On the basis of follow-up data, the 16 children were divided into 2 groups: group I with good results (gradients less than or equal to 49 mm Hg), 12 patients; and group II with poor results (gradients greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg), 4 patients. All 4 patients in group II required repeat balloon valvuloplasty or surgical valvotomy; none from group I required these procedures. Seventeen general, anatomic, physiologic and technical variables were examined by a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with restenosis; these risk factors were: age less than or equal to 3 years; and immediate aortic valvular gradient after valvuloplasty greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg. The immediate and intermediate-term follow-up results of balloon aortic valvuloplasty are encouraging. Recognition of the risk factors may help identify potential candidates for recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of exercise and to determine the influence of the right ventricular (RV) internal dimension on RV systolic function in morbid obesity, M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography were performed on 22 patients whose body weight was at least twice the ideal body weight and who had no clinical or laboratory evidence of underlying organic heart disease or pulmonary disease. RV ejection fraction was measured at rest and during peak supine bicycle exercise. RV exercise response was defined as the change in RV ejection fraction during peak exercise. There was a significant negative correlation between percent over ideal body weight and RV exercise response (r = 0.86, p less than 0.00005) and between RV internal dimension and RV exercise response (r = 0.60, p less than 0.005). There were significant positive correlations between resting RV and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01) and between RV and LV exercise response (r = 0.70, p less than 0.0005). The subgroup with a high-normal or enlarged RV internal dimension (greater than or equal to 2.0 cm, n = 10) experienced no significant change in RV ejection fraction with exercise, whereas the subgroup whose RV internal dimension was less than 2.0 (n = 12) experienced a significant increase in RV ejection fraction from 44 +/- 10% at rest to 58 +/- 11% at peak exercise (p less than 0.03). The results suggest that in morbidly obese individuals without underlying cardiopulmonary disease RV dilatation may predispose to RV systolic dysfunction and assessment of RV systolic function should optimally include evaluation of RV exercise response.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the noninvasive evaluation of pulmonary regurgitation can provide accurate estimates of pulmonary artery (PA) diastolic pressures and PA wedge pressures, Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed immediately before bedside PA catheterization in 29 medical intensive care unit patients. The characteristic color flow Doppler signal of pulmonary regurgitation was detected in 19 (66%) patients. In 17 of the 29 patients (59%), the gradient between the right ventricle and PA at end-diastole could be calculated from the pulsed-wave Doppler signal of pulmonary regurgitation using the simplified Bernoulli equation. Right atrial pressure was then estimated by examination of the jugular venous pulse or by electronic transduction of the pressure signal from a previously placed central venous catheter. A noninvasive estimate of PA diastolic pressure was made by adding the clinical estimate of right atrial pressure to the end-diastolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve. Pulmonary artery catheterization was then performed and stripchart recordings were interpreted by a physician who was unaware of the noninvasively-estimated PA diastolic pressure. The PA diastolic pressure estimated by Doppler echocardiography correlated closely with that found at catheterization (r = 0.94, mean absolute difference 3.3 mm Hg). The noninvasive estimate of PA diastolic pressure also correlated with the PA wedge pressure (r = 0.87, mean absolute difference 3.8 mm Hg). Therefore, in 59% of medical intensive care unit patients, Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of pulmonary regurgitation allowed accurate noninvasive estimation of PA diastolic pressure.\r"

Thirty-five tumors were diploid and 2 were tetraploid. Mean survival was 117 and 52 months for the diploid and tetraploid patients, respectively. The median S-phase fraction (Spf) of the 35 diploid tumors was 4.45%. Of the 17 diploid patients who died of disease, there were 11 tumors with high Spf (greater than 4.45%) and 6 tumors with a low Spf (P less than 0.05 chi-square test). The presence of more than 30% of a solid pattern in the tumor was strongly associated with poor median survival in Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis (P less than 0.05 log rank test). Grade, stage, recurrence, and metastases were also found to be important prognostic factors. Because few tumors were nondiploid, these results suggest that S-phase fraction analysis may be a more useful prognostic indicator than ploidy classification.\r"

We have modified a previously described antibody cocktail to provide complete lymphocyte subset analysis on 100-200-microL samples of whole blood. This method optimizes accuracy of CD4 lymphocyte assessments and provides simultaneous assessment of four other lymphocyte subtypes of interest in specimens with absolute lymphocyte counts as low as 300 X 10(6)/L. Lymphocytes are classified as Thelper (CD3+CD4+); Tsuppressor (CD3+CD8+); Tnull (CD3+CD4-CD8-, putative gamma delta T-cell receptor); B (CD19+CD20+); or natural killer (CD3-CD16+CD56+). The method positively discriminates against contamination of lymphocyte scatter gates by monocytes and unlysed erythrocytes and is compatible with a variety of cell preparation procedures. Increased accuracy of CD4 lymphocyte determinations and simultaneous identification of other lymphocyte subsets whose relationship to disease progression is under study make this an efficient and informative method for disease monitoring and evaluation of therapy in HIV-infected patients.\r"

Seven (44%) of the DCIS and eight (21%) of the infiltrating ductal carcinomas had inadequate material for diagnosis on the aspiration biopsy. Five (32%) of the DCIS and 29 (74%) of the infiltrating ductal carcinomas caused suspicion or had positive results for malignancy. Four (25%) of the DCIS and two (5%) of the infiltrating ductal carcinomas showed atypical cells. Morphologic features of the atypical or malignant cells in the adequate specimens from these two lesions were similar except that the cells from the infiltrating ductal carcinomas showed more irregular nuclear spacing (94% vs. 44%, P less than 0.01) and more pronounced nuclear overlapping (65% vs. 33%) than those from the DCIS. In addition, the fine-needle aspiration biopsies of the DCIS tended to be hypocellular (less than 10 cells/10X) (44% vs. 6.5%, P less than 0.05) and to contain benign epithelial cells (22% vs. 6.5%) and macrophages (33% vs. 13%). Although the suspicion of DCIS might be raised when hypocellularity, benign epithelial cells, and macrophages are noted in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the breast that has positive results or causes suspicion for malignancy, fine-needle aspiration biopsy cannot be relied upon to distinguish DCIS from infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the distribution and specificity of intestinal metaplasia (IM) in columnar lined esophagus (CLE), the authors reviewed biopsies of the hiatal hernia pouch (HHP) and esophagus from 17 patients with CLE (84 biopsies) and 10 controls (25 biopsies). The proximal margin of the gastric folds was used as an endoscopic landmark, corresponding to the gastroesophageal muscular junction (GEMJ). No biopsies obtained above the GEMJ in control patients showed columnar mucosa. No goblet cell metaplasia was seen in 21 biopsies of the HHP from patients with CLE or in 13 corresponding biopsies from controls. In contrast, alcian blue (AB) stains showed diffuse acid mucins in 3 of 21 biopsies of the HHP from patients with CLE and in 10 of 13 corresponding biopsies from controls, demonstrating that goblet cell metaplasia clearly distinguishes biopsies of CLE from the HHP (P less than 0.01), whereas small amounts of diffuse acid mucin on AB stains do not. IM evidenced by goblet cell metaplasia was frequently seen in biopsies only 2-3 cm above the GEMJ, and CLE was limited to that area in three patients, suggesting that the distal esophagus cannot be dismissed as a site for metaplastic and possibly premalignant mucosa. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during the course of the study in one patient with only 5 cm of columnar mucosa above the GEMJ.\r"

Concentrations of cytoferrin in cord sera from 25 normal term neonates were substantially lower but also were elevated (2X) by comparison with normal adult values. Concentrations of cytoferrin in placental tissues were comparable to values previously obtained for various mammalian tissues, and concentrations of cytoferrin in maternal sera were not elevated. This transplacental gradient in serum concentrations of cytoferrin suggests that cytoferrin may be involved in maternofetal iron transport. Although iron is known to be taken up by the hemochorial placenta via trophoblast brush border receptors for transferrin, further iron handling within the placenta is poorly understood. In particular, the routes or carriers by which iron enters the fetal circulation have not been identified. Cytoferrin may participate in stages of maternofetal iron transport distal to transferrin, and further investigation of the role of cytoferrin in neonatal hemochromatosis and other disorders may be warranted.\r"

Despite reports of elevation of levels of this analyte in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, no information is available correlating the serum levels with the actual prostatic abnormalities in men having prostatectomy for presumed benign disease. In the present investigation, the authors compared preoperative serum PSA levels with prostate disease in 81 men with bladder outlet obstruction. Five pathologic groups were found: incidental high-grade carcinoma (n = 3), low-grade carcinoma (n = 11), acute inflammation (n = 16) with or without chronic inflammation, Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (n = 25), and benign hyperplasia (n = 26). Serum PSA levels were significantly elevated in both low- and high-grade carcinoma, acute inflammation, and PIN when compared with the patients with benign hyperplasia with and without chronic inflammation. Within the four groups with elevated levels, use of PSA levels could separate only the high-grade cancer patients who were subsequently shown to have metastatic disease. Only one patient with simple hyperplasia had PSA levels in the abnormal range.\r"

The normal range was -15 to +10, which included 95% of 300 consecutive hospitalized patients. No abnormalities in the MPX were found in 35 patients with beta-thalassemia minor, 8 with iron deficiency, 14 with myeloproliferative disorders, 17 with autoimmune disorders, and 37 patients with lymphoma in complete remission. On the other hand 36% (10/28) of lymphoma patients with active disease either at diagnosis or relapse had a MPX of greater than 10 compared to only 2.3% (7/300) in hospitalized patients (P less than 0.001). Increased levels of MPX were found primarily in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of intermediate or high grades, or Hodgkin's disease [56% (9/16) compared to only 8.3% (1/12) in those with low grade NHLs, P less than 0.05]. The MPX levels returned to normal after successful treatment. Of the various chemotherapeutic agents used, only hydroxyurea led to a consistent elevation of the MPX. The authors conclude that MPX is commonly increased in patients with lymphoma and in those receiving hydroxyurea. Further studies are required to determine if the MPX is a sensitive test for relapse in patients with lymphomas who had an elevated pretreatment value.\r"

Although the tumor focally involved the uterine serosa, suggesting the possible diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma with fatty change, the authors think that, because the bulk of the tumor was located in the retroperitoneum and because the tumor contained characteristic thick-walled blood vessels from which smooth muscle cells radiated, this tumor would be best classified as a retroperitoneal angiomyolipoma. Although both angiomyolipomas and leiomyomas with fatty change presenting as large retroperitoneal tumors are rare, and therefore are not well-recognized by surgical pathologists, they are benign and must be distinguished from liposarcomas.\r"

A 73-year-old man presented with a mass as revealed on a chest x-ray. During surgical operation, a solid, well-circumscribed and encapsulated 9 X 9 X 8 cm tumor was isolated from the right anterior mediastinum. This tumor had neither undergone metastasis nor invaded into the surrounding tissue and lymph nodes. Light microscopy revealed the tumor to be a signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma. Clinically, the neoplasm was coupled with an elevation in serum CEA level, which promptly returned to normal values following surgical removal. Immunohistochemistry pointed out that the majority of neoplastic cells stained positive for CEA. In addition, LECL of unknown origin was distinguished at the periphery of the tumor. LECL was characterized by microcysts which were lined by columnar epithelial and surrounded by lymphoid tissue with germinal centers. Transition between the neoplastic cells and benign epithelial cells of LECL was evident, showing that the previously mentioned mediastinal adenocarcinoma may be derived from the epithelial elements of LECL. This paper discusses the histogenesis of LECL.\r"

There were some foci consisting of neoplasm-like or hyperplastic residual follicles within the lesion. Electron microscopically, a small number of bacilliform organisms were demonstrated within the lesion. X-ray microanalysis of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies was performed and revealed the presence of phosphorus, calcium, iron, and chloride. It is suggested that the malacoplakic lesion may be associated with the hyperplastic or neoplastic follicular lesion, and bacterial infection could be important in the causation of malacoplakia of the thyroid gland.\r"

In the immediate vicinity of the tumor, there was proliferation of cytologically benign endocrine cells in the normal endocervical glands and in the glands showing intraepithelial glandular neoplasia. Both the hyperplastic endocrine cells and the invasive tumor cells showed argyrophilia and immunostaining for neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament, and chromogranin.

  ".W": "One of our stalwarts on the Editorial Board has had a unique experience in the last few years; he has been a transcontinental spouse. In one of his two lives, as he so aptly describes, he has learned how the \"other half\" feels to be \"the spouse of . . .\". His article has currency, not only for the experience itself and its reflection of some marriages today, but because such experience will become commonplace in the future. More and more women have entered medicine and other professional careers and are achieving hierarchical status within their chosen fields. Their male spouses will now have to cope, as our female spouses have for decades, with a quite different role than that of the stereotypic dominant male, so prominent in American conception. My wife, Shirley, and I attended a retreat for first-year freshman medical students not too many years ago. I was privileged to be a member of the small break-out group that consisted of spouses and so-called significant others of the medical students. To my amazement and education, the majority were male (correspondingly, most of the students attending the retreat were female), and the attitudes displayed echoed what I had heard female spouses of the faculty saying for years. For example, one male businessman said, \"Do you mean that if she wants to take a residency in Seattle, I'd have to give up my business and follow her? . . . Hell, no!\" Perhaps he would be like Dr Stiehm and conduct a Los Angeles-Tucson-to-Seattle marriage. Another complained, \"At every party we go to, all they talk about is medicine! Don't they have any other interests?\" And on through the day. On reflection, Shirley and I realized that medical marriages are in for some surprises in the future. Dr Stiehm's experience is just the forerunner of many like it in the future. We will have to find new ways to make relationships work and to be sustained over the years. Men will have to learn to be secondary in interest to friends and colleagues of their successful female spouses. Men will have to learn to tolerate highly technical cocktail-party and dinner-party talk outside their sphere of knowledge, and interest, and scope. We are truly in for a brave new tomorrow. Dr Stiehm's firsthand description will be recognized by many today as pertinent and will be a blueprint for the future. May all have the wisdom and humor of Judy and Dick Stiehm!\r"

  ".W": "To clarify age-related patterns of violent death in childhood, a study was undertaken of medical examiner records concerning 437 deaths of Cook County, Illinois residents, aged younger than 15 years, who died from 1977 through 1982, and whose deaths were ruled as homicides or of an undetermined manner. Males outnumbered females after the age of 1 year. Black children were overrepresented. Perpetrators were usually parents for victims aged younger than 5 years and others for victims aged 5 years or older. Different circumstances of death characterized victims who were younger (mainly beatings) and older (mainly gunshots). Incidence was associated with urban residence and poverty, and it was highest among the youngest and oldest children. Striking differences were found in death rates for age subgroups within standard age groupings (eg, 19.77/100,000 for 1 and 2 years and 6.35/100,000 for 3 and 4 years). Different geographic areas had the highest rates for younger and older victims. We conclude: (1) Separate strategies are needed to protect the two groups at highest risk for homicide: black children aged younger than 3 years and older than 11 years in poor urban areas. (2) Standard homicide reporting practices should include narrow age groupings. (3) Age-related patterns of child homicide must be considered in the planning of prevention trials. (4) Research is needed to clarify why children of different ages are at differing risks in different communities.\r"

Ownership was prevalent among male adolescents (48%) and rare among female adolescents (4%). Among these suburban and rural teenagers, the ownership rate was highest for white male adolescents (56%). Handgun ownership was more frequent among male school dropouts (22%) than enrollees (7%). The first firearm was typically acquired by late childhood or early adolescence (median age, 12.5 years). An adult male family member (eg, father, grandfather, uncle) was the primary source. The prevalence, developmental timing, and sociodemographic correlates of firearm acquisition should be useful for informing preventive clinical practice and interventions.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine predictors of an elevated (greater than or equal to 2 mg/L) trough serum concentration of gentamicin sulfate (undesirable because of potential toxic effects). A total of 140 infants with birth weight of 496 to 4545 g and gestational age of 23 to 42 weeks who received gentamicin in the first days of life were studied prospectively. The trough serum concentration of gentamicin was not significantly affected by concurrent use of dopamine hydrochloride, indomethacin, furosemide, or umbilical artery catheters. Of 11 infants weighing between 1000 and 1500 g on an 18-hour dosing interval, 55% had trough serum gentamicin concentration of 2 mg/L or more. Use of the recommended 24-hour dosing interval for infants weighing less than 1000 g and an 18-hour schedule for preterm infants weighing more than 1000 g resulted in a significant number of elevated trough serum gentamicin concentrations in the latter. A dosing interval of 24 hours for infants less than 1500 g and 18 hours in infants between 1500 and 3250 g is suggested.\r"

This study was undertaken to identify clinical predictors of infection that might narrow the scope of screening adolescent populations. Demographic/clinical data and endocervical smears for the direct-specimen fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody test for Chlamydia trachomatis were collected from 244 consecutive women, 21 years of age or less, attending an adolescent health clinic. Positive direct-specimen fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody test for C trachomatis results were associated with a past history of chlamydial infection, multiple sexual partners, sexual contact with men with urethritis, nonuse of condoms, metrorrhagia, exocervicitis, mucopurulent endocervical discharge, abnormal cervical cytologic features, and isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from the endocervix. These variables were entered into a discriminant analysis to predict direct-specimen fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody test for C trachomatis results. The discriminant function was statistically significant but explained only 17% of between-group variance. Two variables alone, exocervicitis and partners with urethritis, correctly predicted direct-specimen fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody test for C trachomatis results in 79% of all cases (negative predictive value 90%; positive predictive value 35%). When routine screening with reliable laboratory tests is not feasible, selective testing or empirical treatment of adolescent women with either risk factor may be cost-effective alternatives.\r"

Sexually active females 13 to 21 years of age undergoing routine cervical cytologic screening were evaluated in the adolescent clinic of an urban hospital. Cells collected by cervicovaginal lavage from 249 subjects were analyzed for HPV DNA by Southern blot hybridization with probes for HPV types 6/11, 16, and 18. The HPV DNA was detected in 95 (38.2%) of 249 patients. Teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 years with multiple lifetime sexual partners were at higher risk for HPV infection (38/71 [54%]) compared with patients of the same age who had only a single partner (25/74 or [34%]). Twenty (8.3%) of 241 patients had abnormal Papanicolaou smears with atypia, koilocytosis, or low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cytologic abnormalities were detected in 16 (17%) of 94 adolescents with HPV present, but in only 4 (2.7%) of 147 of the uninfected patients. Thus, HPV emerged as a common pathogen in female adolescents, and infected patients are at increased risk for cervical epithelial abnormalities.\r"

Viral isolates were confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence method or by neutralization with well-characterized antibodies. Five varicella-zoster virus isolates (4.3%), 23 cytomegalovirus isolates (19.7%), five herpes simplex virus isolates (4.3%), and one respiratory syncytial virus isolate (0.9%) were found in the patients with varicella. Ten cytomegalovirus isolates (14.3%), two herpes simplex virus isolates (2.9%), one respiratory syncytial virus isolate (1.4%), and one poliovirus isolate (1.4%) were found in the swabs of the healthy control children. The varicella-zoster virus isolation rate from the pharyngeal swabs in children with varicella was low as compared with the rate from those pharyngeal swabs in the children with cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. No varicella-zoster virus isolates could be found in the swabbed materials after filtration (0.45 microns). On the other hand, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus could be isolated from the filtrated swabs, as well as from the unfiltrated swabs. The method of testing by filtration could have affected the results.\r"

We measured the hypopharyngeal oxygen concentration in 10 infants who were receiving oxygen via nasal cannulas and assessed the impact of changes in the flow rate and inspired oxygen concentration. Weaning these infants by reducing the flow rate, even if changes are slight, produces clinically important changes in the oxygen concentration reaching the airway. Such changes are poorly tolerated by infants with chronic lung disease. Changing the flow rate and inspired oxygen concentration, rather than the flow rate alone, provides greater precision and is likely to avoid excessive and abrupt changes in the oxygen concentration reaching the airway.\r"

A pretested questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 113 black females aged 12 to 18 years from a lower socioeconomic population. The three groups did not differ in age, Tanner stage, previous pregnancies, or in demographic variables. Females with boyfriends were more likely than others to be currently sexually active. Overall, 47.8% of the sample was sexually active. Females whose boyfriends were interviewed were more likely to feel that having a baby would ruin their life. Among sexually active females (n = 54), a higher percentage of females whose boyfriends were interviewed (90%) were currently using a prescription method of birth control and demonstrated higher previous contraceptive compliance. There were no differences between the groups with boyfriends in the degree that the females felt their boyfriends supported their use of birth control; those without boyfriends perceived less support. Six months after the initial interview, a higher percentage of sexually active females had a boyfriend as compared with other subjects. Although the 31 females and their boyfriends differed in the mean scores of several sexual behavior and attitude scales, the girls' and their boyfriends' scores on these scales were moderately correlated. These findings suggest that the nature of the heterosexual relationship may influence both the sexual and the contraceptive behavior of black female adolescents.\r"

Total nitrogen intake (preterm milk group, 452 +/- 138 mg/kg per day; preterm + formula group, 406 +/- 93 mg/kg per day), absorption (85%), and retention (71%) were not significantly different between groups. Intact and fragments of secretory IgA and lactoferrin were detected in soluble fecal extracts, and represented 25% and 9% of intake, respectively.

Echocardiography confirmed heart defects in 5 of 41 relatives of patients with isolated HLHS. In four instances, the cardiac abnormality was unrecognized. Among 7 relatives of infants with HLHS and extracardiac anomalies, no heart defects were detected. Cardiac defects occurred in first-degree relatives of probands at a frequency higher than previously predicted by an additive multifactorial model of inheritance. These findings suggest that first-degree relatives of HLHS probands may have an increased risk for subclinical cardiac defects and that genetic factors likely contribute to the cause of left-heart blood-flow lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Suicide by a motor vehicle occurs more commonly than is realized, and may be difficult to prove. Suicide by other means while driving a vehicle is far less common. An automobile driven by a young woman left a road at high speed, became airborne, and came to rest on its top in a front yard. This was initially assumed to be a fatal traffic accident. Upon righting the vehicle, a .357 revolver was found on the ground beside it. A single, fatal, self-inflicted gunshot wound was found in the decedent's midanterior thorax. A suicide note was found in her purse. She had been chronically depressed and had twice attempted suicide. Vehicular suicides may constitute 10-30% of fatal single-vehicle crashes, and must be considered in any vehicular mishap lacking another reasonable explanation. Suicide by other means while driving is far less common than suicidal vehicular collision and suicidal death from carbon monoxide in motor vehicles. An autopsy should be performed in each of these sometimes-low-priority single-vehicle deaths in order to certify vehicular accidents correctly; to discover and document vehicular suicides; and to detect homicides disguised as vehicular mishaps.\r"

The first victim (of two shots) fired the first shot, which was observed, into his mouth, leading to damage to the left optic nerve and frontal lobe. The man still was able to drive his car home, where he shot himself in his right temple. He died 2 days later. The second victim (of three shots) was a 58-year-old man who was found dead on his bed. Reconstruction of the case disclosed that the first shot had passed through his tongue and slightly damaged the second cervical vertebral body. He then shot himself in his right temple, leading to damage of the temporal lobe. Finally, he shot himself in his left temple, resulting in destruction of the pons. In the first case, an amateurishly modified 8-mm blank revolver firing 6.35-mm- (.25)-caliber ammunition was used; in the second case, a rifle firing 5.6-mm (.22)-caliber ammunition with a reduced charge was used. In both cases, low-energy transfer to brain tissue by the initial bullets was due to low bullet energy or due to the bullets' missing the brain or vital centers.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 82 suicides during 1982-1986 that were committed by jumping from buildings was performed using the case files of the Office of the Medical Examiner of Metropolitan Dade County in Miami, Florida, U.S.A. The analysis involved the age, race, and sex of the victim along with the results of toxicologic studies and the cause of death. Additionally, the decedent's place of residence, location of the suicide, height of the building, and the reason for the suicide were investigated. Whether or not a note was left by the decedent was also ascertained. The suicidal \"jumper\" most commonly was a white man who was greater than 60 years of age who died from the resultant multiple injuries. The victim commonly was sober and drug free at the time of the incident. In approximately two-thirds of the cases, the location of the suicide was the victim's residence, which frequently was an apartment or condominium-type dwelling that was seven floors or higher from the ground. The victim often had experienced depression prior to the incident and did not usually leave a suicide note. This article compares the Dade County cases with others that have been studied and discusses the reasons why jumping from a building may have been chosen as the suicidal mechanism.\r"

A portable perfusion device for postmortem angiography at the autopsy table involves attaching quick couplings to a compressed airline. Permanent cast and three-dimensional topographic assessment of vascular anatomy are achieved using solidifying silicone rubber with lead oxide as a contrast medium and stereopair radiographs. This technique can be performed by experienced autopsy technicians and can be linked to normal autopsy services. In our experience, postmortem angiography is useful in investigating all complicated deaths following surgical operations.\r"

The suicide rate for patients of the Oregon State Hospital is 289/100,000, which is similar to other reported suicide rates in hospitalized mentally ill populations. This rate is approximately 18 times higher than the rate for Marion County or the state of Oregon. The suicide rate for inmates of Oregon's four correctional institutions is approximately 29/100,000, which is similar to other reported rates for prisoners.

Examples of the various tattoos were gleaned from the files of the Dade County Medical Examiner Department. In general, tattoos on Cuban refugees signify prior incarceration in Cuban prisons, usually do not reflect criminal specialization, and often reflect affiliation to Afro-Caribbean cults (especially Santeria, Palo Mayombe, and the Abakua Secret Society). In addition, many tattoos reflect the values and attitudes of Cuban jail subculture.\r"

This study, a review of 24 TCA-related deaths, is aimed at defining the practical significance of such a problem and providing a workable approach to interpreting postmortem TCA levels. Deaths clearly due to TCA drugs were compared with deaths that were not caused by TCA drugs, but in which the decedent's postmortem blood tested positive for TCA medications. There is little evidence that postmortem elevations in blood TCA levels cause frequent problems in differentiating lethal from nonlethal levels (overdose from nonoverdose cases). The data suggest that using a heart blood level of 0.100 mg/dl as an indicator of lethality is practical at the present time and poses little likelihood of error. Isolated cases suggest that postmortem TCA increases can occur; further work is needed in this area to clarify more fully the significance and frequency of such cases. At present, it seems prudent to utilize peripheral blood samples for TCA testing on autopsy material, if a conservative estimate of TCA concentration is desired, possibly augmented by liver TCA levels and parent-metabolite ratios if money, facilities, and time permit.\r"

The widespread, patchy intraalveolar histiocytic desquamation was associated with lymphocytic infiltration of bronchiolar and aveolar walls, which together provided convincing evidence that an interstitial pneumonitis was the cause of death.

We report here chromosomal localization of the gene for the catalytically and regulatorily important alpha-subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Analysis of 24 rodent x human cell hybrids by Southern blotting with cDNA probes for the human alpha-subunit indicated complete cosegregation of the gene for the alpha-subunit with human chromosome 10. A cell hybrid containing only part of chromosome 10 mapped the gene to 10q11----qter. In situ hybridization mapped the gene to 10q21.3-23.1. The gene for the alpha-subunit is thus not physically linked to that for the beta-subunit of the enzyme.\r"

Four such probes were used to screen a panel of human DNA samples for genetic differences. One of these probes detected a 5.0-kb deletion in two related individuals. Cloning and DNA hybridization analysis indicated that the nondeleted common allele contained an intact RTVL-H element, whereas the deleted variant allele contained only a single LTR. DNA sequence comparisons strongly suggest that the deletion is due to homologous recombination between the 5' and 3' LTRs of the RTVL-H sequence. This is the first reported case of a DNA variation in humans that is due to an LTR-LTR excision event.\r"

There is little evidence for an excess risk of fetal death, at least following amniocentesis, for 47,XXX, 47,XXY, or 47,XYY. The excess risks of fetal death were adjusted for the likelihood that a fetus of normal karyotype would undergo spontaneous fetal death in a population of older maternal age similar to that in which prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis is undertaken. The absolute fetal death rates when this factor is ignored are about 3.5% higher (i.e., may be derived by adding 3.5% to the values given). The excess risks are those which are most appropriate for use in estimating the contribution of chromosome abnormalities to spontaneous fetal death.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that this class of chromosome 16 alpha satellite (D16Z2) is organized as a series of diverged 340-bp dimers arranged in a tandem array of 1.7-kb higher-order repeat units. As measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the total D16Z2 array spans approximately 1,400-2,000 kb of centromeric DNA. These sequences are highly polymorphic, both by conventional agarose-gel electrophoresis and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Investigation of this family of alpha satellite should facilitate the further genomic, cytogenetic, and genetic analysis of chromosome 16.\r"

  ".W": "The debrisoquine-4-hydroxylase polymorphism is a genetic variation in oxidative drug metabolism characterized by two phenotypes, the extensive metabolizer (EM) and poor metabolizer (PM). Of the Caucasian populations of Europe and North America, 5%-10% are of the PM phenotype and are unable to metabolize debrisoquine and numerous other drugs. The defect is caused by several mutant alleles of the CYP2D6 gene, two of which are detected in about 70% of PMs. We have constructed a genomic library from lymphocyte DNA of an EM positively identified by pedigree analysis to be homozygous for the normal CYP2D6 allele. The normal CYP2D6 gene was isolated; was completely sequenced, including 1,531 and 3,522 bp of 5' and 3' flanking DNA, respectively; and was found to contain nine exons within 4,378 bp. Two other genes, designated CYP2D7 and CYP2D8P, were also cloned and sequenced. CYP2D8P contains several gene-disrupting insertions, deletions, and termination codons within its exons, indicating that this is a pseudogene. CYP2D7, which is just downstream of CYP2D8P, is apparently normal, except for the presence, in the first exon, of an insertion that disrupts the reading frame. A hypothesis is presented that the presence of a pseudogene within the CYP2D subfamily transfers detrimental mutations via gene conversions into the CYP2D6 gene, thus accounting for the high frequency of mutations observed in the CYP2D6 gene in humans.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed DNA from nine French-Canadian probands from eastern Quebec province; all had hyperphenylalaninemia (phenylketonuria [PKU] or non-PKU forms) caused by mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus. Analysis of RFLP haplotypes and mutations revealed a novel mutation, an A-to-G transition (met----val) in codon 1 (the translation-initiation codon). It occurred on 5 of the 18 mutant chromosomes and was associated each time with haplotype 2. A proband homozygous for this mutation had the PKU phenotype. In other probands, the codon 1 mutation was inherited once with the splice junction mutation in exon 12 (on haplotype 3), conferring PKU, and was inherited twice with a mutation on haplotype 1, conferring PKU in one proband and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia in the other. The other five probands carried mutations, conferring PKU, on the following haplotype combinations: 1/3 (twice), 1/9, 3/4, and 1/1. The mutations on haplotypes 1, 4, and 9 are not yet characterized. This preliminary study reveals a novel PKU mutation and considerable genetic heterogeneity at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in French-Canadians.\r"

Likelihood analysis of RFPI supported recessive inheritance of an allele with a frequency of 46%, which elevated mean RFPI from .412 to .533 when homozygous. The analysis apportioned the variance in RFPI as 42.3% due to the major locus, 9.5% due to polygenic inheritance, and 48.2% due to random environmental effects. Homozygotes for the recessive allele tended to have small suprailiac skinfold thicknesses rather than large subscapular skinfold thicknesses. Homozygotes were more frequent in younger than in older cases of obesity, coronary heart disease, essential hypertension, and diabetes mellitus; the increase was significant for all but diabetes.\r"

Approximately 3,500 TaqI-digested DNAs were analyzed from the three populations studied. An apparent continuum of alleles was detected varying in size from 2.9 kb to 8.3 kb. Estimates of the average probability of exclusion were found to be .90 and .79 for the North American black and Caucasian populations, respectively. Gene frequency data for common and rare alleles indicated a potential paternity index ranging from 2 to 450.\r"

Subsequent chromosome walking experiments revealed that D7S122 in within close distance to another randomly isolated DNA marker, D7S340. To determine the physical relationship among D7S122, D7S340, MET, and D7S8, we have constructed a long-range restriction map of the region containing these four DNA segments, by using DNA from a human/hamster somatic hybrid cell line 4AF-KO15 (containing a single human chromosome 7) and a series of rare-cutting restriction enzymes. The combined results of complete, partial, and double digestion analyses confirm that D7S122 and D7S340 are located between MET and D7S8. The order of these markers is MET-D7S340-D7S122-D7S8, with distance intervals of approximately 500, 10, and 980 kbp, respectively. Together with family analysis, this information will be useful for eventual identification of the CF gene.\r"

In some CMT families linkage has been reported with either the Duffy blood group or the APOA2 gene, both located on chromosome 1q. More recently, linkage has been found in six CMT families with two chromosome 17p markers. We extensively analyzed a multi-generation Charcot-Marie-Tooth family by using molecular genetic techniques in order to localize the CMT gene defect. First, we constructed a continuous linkage group of 11 chromosome 1 markers and definitely excluded chromosome 1 as the site of mutation. Second, we analyzed the family for linkage with chromosome 17. The two-point lod scores obtained with D17S58 and D17S71 proved that this Charcot-Marie-Tooth family is linked to chromosome 17. Moreover, multipoint linkage results indicated that the mutation is most likely located on the chromosome 17p arm, distal of D17S71.\r"
