The study group consisted of 184 children ranging in age from newborn to 20 years who had a normal conus level as reported by the radiologist of record. The range of conus levels for the entire group of normal children was T12 to L3. The range for the 0-2-year-old group was T12 to L2-L3 with an average of L1-L2. The range of conus levels for the 19-20-year-old group was L1 to L2 with an average of L1-L2. We conclude that the conus medullaris does not ascend throughout childhood as stated by previous authors but attains the adult level sometime during the first few months of life. A conus level at L2-L3 or above should be considered normal at any age. A conus level at L3 is indeterminate, since it is possible for a normal or a tethered conus to be located at this level.\r"

Twenty-three patients (22%) with clinical or plain film findings compatible with dysraphism had normal-appearing cords on conventional myelography, movement between supine and prone positions, and no lesions in the spinal canal. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (majority of tonsils between foramen magnum and C1) was found in 17 patients (16%). Six patients (6%) exhibited varying degrees of hydromyelia. In the supine position, CT-myelography of meningoceles, meningomyeloceles, or lipomeningomyeloceles may limit demonstration of the neural placode and nerve roots because of compression of the CSF-containing sac. In the decubitus position, CT scans improved demonstration of neural tissue-CSF space relationships. CT scans were useful in demonstrating anomalous paraspinal bones, diastematomyelia spurs, and spinal and sacral bone deficiency. Axial CT-myelography of intradural lipomas showed apparent neural tissue extension into the lipomas.\r"

Middle cerebral artery velocities were greater than anterior cerebral velocities. Likewise, antegrade diastolic flow was always seen in these normal neonates.

The study was conducted in two parts. First, 14 neonates were examined with CDI by using a standard approach through the anterior fontanel. Whenever possible, views through the posterior fontanel and the temporal bone were obtained also. The anterior cerebral, M1 segment of the middle cerebral, distal internal carotid, and basilar arteries were demonstrated consistently. Portions of the vertebral distal middle cerebral, and posterior cerebral arteries were frequently visualized. In the second part of the study, we examined 10 neonates who had undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this group of patients, CDI was able to demonstrate occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and the reversal of flow through the ipsilateral A1 segment. Increased flow on the contralateral side and in the basilar artery was observed in several patients. The anterior fontanel approach was shown to be the most useful in identifying most of the major intracranial arteries and veins with CDI. In addition, the body weights and gestational ages of the neonates were found to significantly influence the success rate in visualizing the intracranial vasculature.\r"

This study was undertaken to see if color-flow Doppler could give semiquantitative information about the degree of stenosis at the origin of the internal carotid artery. The factors evaluated on color flow are the width of the lumen as estimated from the color-flow image relative to the width of the vessel, the degree of turbulence (evidenced by the mosaic pattern), and the pulse-repetition frequency necessary to prevent aliasing. A double-blind comparison with conventional duplex scanning in 146 carotid bifurcations in 74 patients was carried out. In 91%, the color-flow assessment was in complete agreement with the duplex assessment. In the remaining 9%, the color flow differed from the duplex by only one stenosis group, and the distributions of over- and under-estimation were equal. These results showed comparable assessment of the degree of stenosis with conventional duplex and color Doppler technology.\r"

Four lesions originated in the right lobe and two originated in the left lobe. Satellite nodules were seen at presentation in one case and developed after presentation in two others. Other features, such as enhancement after contrast administration, necrosis, and calcification, were variable. Three of six lesions had areas of very low density, suggestive of necrosis. One mass had calcifications. After IV contrast administration, no enhancement occurred in three tumors, patchy enhancement occurred in two, and an enhancing ring was seen in the remaining tumor. The radiologic presentation of primary lymphoma of the liver differs from that of secondary involvement of the liver in systemic lymphoma. Whereas secondary lymphoma is often diffusely infiltrative and difficult to detect on CT, the lesions of primary lymphoma of the liver are easily identified on CT scans even before the administration of IV contrast material. Although rare, primary lymphoma of the liver should be included in the differential diagnosis of a large, hypodense liver mass on CT.\r"

The cases were collected over a 13-month period. The chest radiographs generally underestimated the extent of the pneumatosis, as subsequently seen on plain abdominal films. However, the portions of bowel most extensively involved were those seen on the chest radiographs (transverse colon, hepatic and splenic flexures, stomach). One patient had pneumoperitoneum also. Pneumatosis developed within 6-293 days after transplantation. The cause of pneumatosis intestinalis was multifactorial. Three patients were asymptomatic. Clinical management of all seven patients was altered because of the detection of pneumatosis. The dose of steroids was increased in three patients to treat graft-vs-host disease, antibiotic drugs were given to three patients for enteric pathogens, and bowel rest was prescribed for one patient with mucosal injury from intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These cases show that the chest radiograph makes early diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis possible in posttransplantation patients.\r"

Although the consequences of hypokalemia are widely documented and recognized, it is only recently that the importance of magnesium deficiency as a cause of potassium depletion has gained clinical attention. Because of the association between hypokalemia and ventricular ectopy/sudden death, familiarity with the causes of magnesium loss, as well as enhanced identification and treatment, appear to be important.\r"

Medical therapy, neurohormonal activation and decreased dietary intake could all contribute to low concentrations of serum and muscle magnesium. Although the ideal serum level of this electrolyte is not known, multiple studies have documented lower magnesium concentrations in patients with heart failure than in normal persons. Magnesium deficiency could theoretically produce hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular arrhythmias. These complications have been observed in animals and in patients without heart failure, and magnesium repletion has reversed the adverse effects of hypomagnesemia in some patients. However, the consequences of chronic depletion of the electrolyte have not been adequately evaluated. Because of the high incidence of sudden death in patients with severe congestive heart failure, well designed investigations to determine the importance of magnesium are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary magnesium (Mg) deficiency is more prevalent than generally suspected and can cause cardiovascular lesions leading to disease at all stages of life. The average American diet is deficient in Mg, especially in the young, in alcoholic persons, and in those under stress or with diseases or receiving certain drug therapies, who have increased Mg needs. Otherwise normal, Mg-deficient diets cause arterial and myocardial lesions in all animals studied, and diets that are atherogenic, thrombogenic and cardiovasopathic, as well as Mg-deficient, intensify the cardiovascular lesions, whereas Mg supplementation prevents them. Diuretics and digitalis can intensify an underlying Mg deficiency, leading to cardiac arrhythmias that are refractory unless Mg is added to the regimen. Potassium (K) depletion in diuretic-treated hypertensive patients has been linked to an increased incidence of ventricular ectopy and sudden death. K supplementation alone is not the answer. Mg has been found to be necessary to intracellular K repletion in these patients. Because patients with congestive heart failure and others receiving diuretic therapy are also prone to chloride loss leading to metabolic alkalosis that also interferes with K repletion, the addition of Mg and chloride supplements in addition to the K seems prudent.\r"

A double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled protocol was used, and 6 large, urban hospitals, both university-affiliated and private, participated. The study involved 113 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, a ventricular rate greater than or equal to 120 beats/min and systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg without severe heart failure. The dose of intravenous diltiazem (or identical placebo) was 0.25 mg/kg/2 minutes followed 15 minutes later by 0.35 mg/kg/2 minutes if the first dose was tolerated but ineffective. If a patient did not respond, the code was broken and the patient was allowed to receive open-label diltiazem if placebo had been given. Of 56 patients, 42 (75%) randomized to receive diltiazem responded to 0.25 mg/kg and 10 of 14 responded to 0.35 mg/kg, for a total response rate of 52 of 56 patients (93%), whereas 7 of 57 patients (12%) responded to placebo (p less than 0.001). After the double-blind protocol, 49 of the 57 patients who received placebo were then given diltiazem; 47 of 49 responded, for an overall response rate of 99 of 105 patients (94%) with diltiazem. The median time from the start of drug infusion to the maximal decrease in heart rate was 4.3 minutes. Side effects occurred in 14 patients, 7 of whom had asymptomatic hypotension not requiring intervention. Thus, intravenous diltiazem was rapidly effective for slowing the ventricular response in most patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Blood pressure decreased slightly. Side effects were mild.\r"

Some of the latter are physiologic, notably sex steroid levels and possibly changes in adiposity, whereas others are modulated by diet and other aspects of lifestyle, such as cigarette smoking and hypertension. Recent declines in atherosclerotic disease suggest that the rate of atherogenesis is amenable to both changes in lifestyle and effective pharmacologic management of risk factors, deferring the onset of clinical disease until late in life or preventing its emergence altogether.\r"

  ".W": "According to major surveys, hypertension is found in over half the population aged 65 years or over. In this age group, systolic blood pressure is at least as important as diastolic blood pressure as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Overall, the presence of hypertension is associated with approximately a threefold increase in the likelihood of major events. Differing factors contribute to the hypertension. Loss of proximal arterial compliance, affecting the larger conduit vessels, occurs often with aging and explains the tendency for systolic pressure to increase while diastolic pressure remains constant or even decreases. A loss of baroreceptor sensitivity also may contribute to hypertension. There is an increase in responsiveness of the sympathetic nervous system and an enhanced sensitivity to its effects in the elderly, perhaps reflecting a decline in the buffering activity of peripheral vascular beta receptors. It is possible, too, that sodium retention may contribute to hypertension in some older patients. Although diuretics traditionally have been the mainstay of treatment in these patients, it is now recognized that other classes of antihypertensive agents may be equally as effective yet less prone to metabolic or symptomatic adverse events. Sympatholytic drugs, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either as monotherapy or in combination with low-dose diuretics, have been shown to be efficacious in the elderly. These agents also can produce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, an additional property that may contribute to a reduction in serious cardiac complications.\r"

The differences in percentage changes in LDL cholesterol between gemfibrozil- and placebo-treated men varied among Fredrickson hyperlipoproteinemia types; after 1 year of treatment the difference was greatest for type IIA hyperlipoproteinemia (14 percentage units) and smallest for IIB hyperlipoproteinemia (3 percentage units). The treatment-associated changes in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides did not differ materially between the 3 hyperlipoproteinemia types, when calculated in the same way. The gemfibrozil-associated reduction in incidence of definite coronary events varied among Fredrickson types and among tertiles of baseline HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The greatest rate reductions were seen in subjects with type IIB hyperlipoproteinemia, low initial HDL level or high initial triglycerides. These results suggest that subjects with low HDL cholesterol and type IIB hyperlipoproteinemia (and possibly type IV hyperlipoproteinemia) would benefit from treatment with gemfibrozil.\r"

Advanced lesions may not be amenable to treatment, but a reversal of cholesterol accumulation may be possible. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) could serve an important function in this reversal through their role in the process of reverse cholesterol transport, which removes cholesterol from the body. Reverse cholesterol transport could be stimulated by raising plasma HDL level, but the efficacy of the process may be determined by the way in which HDL level is elevated. The increase of HDL synthesis rate may be the best approach. The antiatherosclerotic effects of gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering agent that appears to raise HDL synthesis rate, may be mediated through this mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine A (CyA) given to prevent xenograft rejection induces renal function impairment. In the last few years many studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanism(s) of CyA-induced renal insufficiency. In humans, several specific findings--interstitial fibrosis, toxic tubulopathy, peritubular capillary congestion, arteriolopathy--have been associated with CyA administration. It is now recognized that CyA renal toxicity mainly manifests under three different syndromes: (1) acute reversible decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), (2) acute microvascular disease with the pattern of thrombotic microangiopathy, and (3) chronic irreversible renal damage. This review analyzes the available evidence that the clinical syndromes of CyA nephrotoxicity are related to changes induced by CyA on renal vessels. Experimental studies have failed to document that the activation of renin-angiotensin axis or sympathetic nervous system plays a relevant role in the development of CyA-associated renal vasoconstriction, which is the main causal factor of acute reversible decrease in GFR, whereas it is possible that changes in arachidonic acid metabolites with vasoactive properties contribute to this CyA-induced phenomenon. In this context, findings of increased urinary TxB2 and protective effect of TxA2 receptor blocking are of particular interest. Since the introduction of CyA in clinical practice, a syndrome of thrombotic microangiopathy resembling hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been recognized in humans and reproduced in experimental animals. This is a rare form of vascular toxicity attributed to CyA which may have a poor prognosis and possibly results from a direct toxic effect of CyA on vascular endothelium. The syndrome of chronic progressive deterioration of renal function associated with CyA was first recognized in humans. Until recently the possibility of reproducing this syndrome in animals in order to better understand its nature was not addressed. As in humans, when animals are given CyA for greater than 2 months they may develop chronic renal insufficiency with tubular arteriopathy and interstitial fibrosis. A peculiar form of tubulointerstitial damage has been recognized in association with CyA, and called striped interstitial fibrosis, that is probably due to tubular collapse induced by afferent vasoconstriction. This lesion may be improved by withdrawal of CyA, but renal function usually does not normalize.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clinical and laboratory characteristics at entry and at follow-up of 85 patients in a prospective therapeutic trial of plasmapheresis were examined to determine if these morphologic variants had prognostic implications. Addition of plasmapheresis to the therapeutic regimen did not affect outcome, and the two treatment groups were analyzed together. Patients with the three patterns of lupus GN were similar demographically and clinically, and they had similar serum creatinines at entry (SEG, 1.87 +/- 0.28 mg/dL [mean +/- SE], v diffuse GN, 2.11 +/- 0.21, v MGN + PGN, 2.12 +/- 0.26; P = 0.75). Although significant differences were found in the initial serum C3 (SEG, 46 +/- 5 mg/dL, v diffuse GN, 34 +/- 3, v MGN + PGN, 45 +/- 3; P = 0.02) and urinary protein excretion (SEG, 3.6 +/- 0.6 g/24 h, v diffuse GN, 6.0 +/- 0.7, v MGN + PGN, 6.7 +/- 0.9; p = 0.03), none of the clinical or laboratory data predicted the morphologic pattern of the glomerular lesion. Adverse outcomes included defined clinical stop points, nonfatal renal failure, and death. One half of the patients with MGN + PGN (13/26) had an adverse outcome, compared with 5/24 patients with SEG and 11/35 patients with diffuse GN. This trend was supported by actuarial analysis of outcomes showing that patients with MGN + PGN had the lowest cumulative proportion without adverse outcome after 175 weeks of follow-up (MGN + PGN, 0.40, v SEG, 0.77, v diffuse GN, 0.64; P = 0.04). We concluded that (1) at presentation, the specific glomerular lesion in severe lupus GN cannot be predicted on clinical or serological criteria alone; (2) on the basis of morbidity and mortality, cases with all three morphologic variants should be classified as severe lupus GN; and (3) patients with MGN + PGN appear to experience more adverse outcomes than patients with SEG or diffuse GN.\r"

After a 4-week baseline period, patients were randomized to receive either placebo or 10 mg lovastatin twice daily for a period of 6 weeks. The dose of lovastatin was increased to 20 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, and 40 mg twice daily for 6 weeks in the latter group. Those patients who received placebo for the first 6 weeks subsequently received 10, 20, and 40 mg of lovastatin twice daily in a stepped dose regimen, with each dose given for 6 weeks. Lovastatin was well tolerated by all patients and none withdrew from the study. Baseline plasma cholesterol concentrations (390 +/- 20 mg/dL; mean +/- SEM) decreased 22% (P less than 0.003) at the lowest dose of 10 mg twice daily, 27% at 20 mg twice daily, and 33% at 40 mg twice daily.

Concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fell by 29%, 34%, and 45% on doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg of lovastatin twice daily. Concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased slightly. Serum creatinine concentrations and proteinuria were not affected by lovastatin therapy.

A reproducible scoring system for the analysis of silver-stained chromosomes was developed, and this was applied to the analysis of study participants in a blinded fashion. Seven of the 58 parents of children with trisomy 21 and seven of the 50 control parents were found to have variant NORs on silver staining. Therefore, we do not find a demonstrable risk for nondisjunction of chromosome 21 in individuals with silver-staining variants.\r"

  ".W": "Wilms tumor of the kidney occurs with increased frequency in association with two clinically and cytogenetically distinct congenital syndromes, the Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS) and the triad of aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (WAGR). Constitutional deletions in the latter situation and similar alterations in sporadic Wilms tumors have implicated the chromosomal 11p13 region in neoplastic development. In contrast, some sporadic cases of WBS have been reported to have a constitutional duplication of chromosome 11p15. In order to resolve this seeming paradox, we have analyzed a family segregating WBS for linkage to DNA markers mapped to chromosome 11p. Consonant with the cytogenetic alterations in sporadic WBS cases, we obtained evidence for tight linkage of the mutation causing the syndrome to markers located at 11p15.5. Also consistent with this localization, we identified a subset of Wilms tumors, not associated with WBS, which have attained somatic homozygosity through mitotic recombination, with the smallest shared region of overlap being distal to the beta-globin complex at 11p15.5. These data provide evidence that familial WBS likely results from a defect at the same genetic locus as does its sporadic counterpart. Further, the data suggest there is another locus, distinct from that involved in the WAGR syndrome, which plays a role in the association of Wilms tumor with WBS.\r"

Since rare patients show varying karyotypic abnormalities on the short arm of chromosome 11, it has been suggested that BWS may be related to the Wilms tumor gene on 11p13 or, alternatively, to growth factor genes on 11p15. We performed genetic linkage analysis on two BWS kindreds, using RFLPs for loci on 11p. BWS was linked to the insulin gene (11p15.5), with an overall maximum lod score of 3.60 (recombination fraction = .00). Linkage to D11S16 (11p13) could be excluded for recombination fractions less than or equal to .03. These results suggest that BWS defines a tumor-predisposition gene on 11p15.\r"

The authors present an unusual case of Turner's syndrome with an aortic sinus aneurysm and severe aortic insufficiency in the absence of coarctation of the aorta. The various cardiovascular anomalies seen in Turner's syndrome, such as coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic dissection, aortic sinus aneurysm and ascending aorta aneurysm, can best be understood on a common basis of congenital structural abnormalities involving the aorta and the aortic valve. The only evidence available for such an abnormality is the presence of cystic medial necrosis in the affected vascular tissues.\r"

NAF was about three times more potent than fMet-Leu-Phe, but considerably less potent than endotoxin. The response to NAF was not inhibited by the endotoxin inhibitor polymyxin B or the protein synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D. Histology of NAF-induced lesions showed large numbers of neutrophils, but no monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, or lymphocytes were observed. Intravascular neutrophil accumulation, aggregate formation, and venular wall damage were also apparent. In vitro, NAF stimulated rabbit neutrophils as shown by the release of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. This study demonstrates that NAF elicits a rapid inflammatory response in vivo with massive neutrophil emigration, which is qualitatively similar to that observed with other chemotactic agonists.\r"

A limited distribution of the 28 kd peptides was observed in specialized BM of the kidney, eye, cochlea, lung, and brain, whereas type IV collagen is found in all human BM. These novel peptides, which colocalize with each other, are found in BM that also contain type IV collagen but do not, in all cases, colocalize with type IV collagen. The presence of the 28 kd peptides in the BM of the kidney, cochlea, and eye is in keeping with abnormalities involving these components in BM of patients with Alport familial nephritis (FN), who frequently have hearing loss, anterior lenticonus and retinal flecks in addition to renal disease. These 28 kd peptides are distinct, biochemically and immunochemically, from the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chain NC1 peptides of type IV collagen, and represent either peptide fragments of genetically distinct BM collagen molecules or additional molecules originating from the same gene family as type IV collagen.\r"

The authors investigated the production and distribution of ECM constituents by cultured rat MCs, using immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Staining for all ECM constituents increased after serum feeding. Localization was strictly intracellular until confluency, when extracellular deposition of collagen IV and laminin appeared, followed by fibronectin and collagen III. In parallel, the intracellular staining for these proteins diminished markedly. Neither extracellular deposition nor intracellular loss was observed for collagen I and thrombospondin. On surfaces coated with collagen IV or laminin, extracellular deposition of ECM constituents clearly preceded confluency. These results indicate that synthesis of ECM constituents parallels MC growth, and that extracellular deposition of ECM occurs at cell-cell contact. Collagen IV or laminin secreted by MCs in the substratum accelerates production and facilitates secretion of other ECM constituents in an autocrine fashion.\r"

Endothelial cells from normal, endotoxin-treated, and balloon-injured rats were stained with vWF antibodies and visualized using a biotinylated secondary antibody and avidin-tagged peroxidase. Endotoxin treatment and balloon injury caused a threefold increase in intracellular vWF, and immunoelectron microscopy showed the endoplasmic reticulum to stain heavily by the vWF antibody. Weibel-Palade bodies were not observed in all the cell profiles examined. The basement membrane of the endothelialized vessels showed no vWF staining; however, after endothelial denudation this matrix was clearly stained by the antibody. These results suggest that endothelial injury leads to an increased intracellular content of vWF that is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum.\r"

Lead exposure is not a problem for urban poor children alone, but inner-city minorities have a higher rate of exposure. The overabundance of lead coexists in the same area with two serious shortages: affordable housing and jobs.

A significant change in perceived anxiety was found in patients who received metoprolol, but there was no significant change in the placebo group. The correlation between the observers' assessment and the patients' visual analogue scores was poor, but some correlation was found between the assessed relief of anxiety and the changes in visual analogue score.

The response to treatment was assessed by measuring pain-free walking time on the treadmill and by Doppler ankle/arm systolic pressure ratio at rest and after treadmill. Both pentoxifylline and acenocoumarol were significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the proportion of patients who improved their performance on the treadmill after one year of treatment. Benefit from active treatment was also apparent from the results of Doppler examinations performed after physical exercise. No significant differences were observed in comparing the effect of one active drug versus the other or versus the combined treatment. Five major hemorrhagic complications were registered in anticoagulated patients, two fatal cerebral hemorrhages and one gastrointestinal bleeding occurring in the group treated with both active drugs. The investigators conclude that (1) pentoxifylline is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication (2) the benefits of oral anticoagulant therapy are outweighed by the risk of serious bleeding, and (3) the risk of bleeding is probably increased by the combined treatment with pentoxifylline.\r"

None of them was suffering from hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or symptomatic coronary heart or peripheral artery disease. The echotomographic analysis, using B-mode real-time echotomography revealed atherosclerotic lesions in 26 patients. The hemorheologic pattern (hematocrit, fibrinogen, whole blood filterability, whole blood and plasma viscosity) was determined in all the patients three months after the clinical event. Statistical analysis of the results indicates a possible link between atherosclerotic lesions of the extracranial carotid tract and age, fibrinogen levels, and whole blood filterability.\r"

The subjects were studied during heparin perfusion alone and during heparin perfusion together with prostacyclin. The authors investigated the effect of two heparin regimens (regimen I: 2,000 U/hr and regimen II: 500 U/hr) upon plasma antithrombin level (IU/mL) and activated thromboplastin time (sec). Our findings show: (1) prostacyclin can substitute for heparin anticoagulation in hemodialysis; (2) the concomitant administration of prostacyclin enhances the anticoagulant effect of heparin, based on the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time; (3) the antithrombin activity is increased by both treatments but more so with prostacyclin; and (4) platelet activation plays a role in limiting heparin anticoagulation, a conclusion partly supported by the finding that activated partial thromboplastin time is somewhat more prolonged by heparin when measured in platelet-poor rather than in platelet-rich plasma in the presence of prostacyclin. Physiopathologic implications of these preliminary findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Quinapril is an orally active, non-peptide, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that acts potently and specifically to interrupt the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in both plasma and tissue. Quinapril is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active diacid form quinaprilat. Quinapril is efficacious in hypertensive models exhibiting both high (renal hypertensive rats, diuretic-treated dogs) and normal (spontaneously hypertensive rats) plasma renin activity. Quinapril does not prevent the development of hypertension when plasma renin activity (PRA) is markedly suppressed as in the deoxycorticosterone-saline treated rat. Hemodynamic studies in dogs indicate that quinapril decreases total peripheral and renal vascular resistance. Quinaprilat produces natriuresis and mild diuresis at doses that do not alter mean arterial blood pressure. Quinapril has the potential to affect plasma lipids beneficially or at least be \"lipid neutral.\" Oral absorption of quinapril is rapid in rats, dogs, and monkeys. There is rapid and extensive distribution of radiolabel to most tissues except brain. Plasma radiolabel concentration-time profiles exhibit polyexponential decay with a prolonged terminal phase at low concentrations in all species. Metabolism to compounds other than quinaprilat is not extensive. Quinapril is excreted primarily as quinaprilat and to a lesser degree as quinapril. Quinapril is well tolerated in a variety of pharmacologic safety screens and its toxicity profile is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Quinapril does not adversely affect reproduction; it is not teratogenic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Quinapril is converted to quinaprilat, a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and is currently being studied for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. In studies of healthy volunteers, single quinapril doses of 0.625 mg to 80 mg inhibited plasma ACE activity for up to forty-eight hours. Dose-related inhibition of angiotensin I pressor response occurred after administration of quinapril doses of 0.625 mg to 20 mg. In addition, plasma renin activity increased and aldosterone and angiotensin II concentrations decreased following single or multiple doses of quinapril. Subsequently, dose-ranging studies were conducted in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and congestive heart failure. Pilot studies suggested that 5 mg of quinapril given once daily had minimal antihypertensive effect. Therefore, a definitive, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 5, 10, and 20 mg once daily doses of quinapril was performed. Quinapril doses of 10 mg and 20 mg were statistically significantly superior to placebo (p less than 0.05) in lowering sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP), whereas 5 mg of quinapril had only marginal clinical effectiveness. A twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring study indicated that quinapril administered once or twice daily effectively lowered DBP in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This study suggested, however, that some patients may not achieve sustained reductions in DBP over the entire twenty-four-hour interval with quinapril administered once daily and may require twice daily therapy. In studies of patients with refractory congestive heart failure, acute favorable hemodynamic effects were demonstrated after the administration of quinapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reductions in DBP of up to 13 mm Hg were obtained, and in full dosage more than 65% of patients achieved a reduction in DBP of 10 mm Hg or more from baseline or reduced their DBP to 90 mm Hg or less. Quinapril was well tolerated, and reported adverse effects were scarcely more frequent than in the placebo group. Once daily doses of quinapril were as safe and effective as twice-daily doses.

When the data for all studies were combined, an age analysis showed no increase in the total reporting of adverse events in the 379 elderly patients studied. The incidence of events was lower in those patients who did not take concomitant diuretic therapy. A comparison of the double-blind phases showed quinapril to have a lower incidence of adverse events than captopril, enalapril, or chlorthalidone. An analysis of the onset of events, or withdrawals, did not show an increase with time on quinapril therapy, and no dose-relationship. A review of serious adverse events did not reveal an unexpected occurrence or a high incidence of serious events considered to be related to quinapril therapy. The proportion of patients who experienced \"first-dose\" hypotension, or symptomatic hypotension was similar to captopril or enalapril. Quinapril, a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, has been extensively studied and is equally well tolerated in the young and elderly for the treatment of hypertension and CHF.\r"

One series of studies was done to determine the influence of room temperature on peripheral flow in healthy subjects and patients with peripheral vascular disease. The room temperature was varied from 30 degrees to 35 degrees C. The temperature from 24 degrees to 30 degrees C had only minor effects on the circulation. Thus, it seemed appropriate to use a room temperature in the lower range, usually 23 degrees C. Another series of studies showed the effect of changing skin temperatures locally at the finger tip or toe tip on the plantar and volar surfaces in healthy subjects and in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Results showed that as temperature was increased from 10 degrees to 45 degrees, there was a marked increase in the finger and toe circulations, which was considerably greater in the normal subjects as compared with those with digital disease. The ideal temperature at which to work as a routine is 40 degrees C as opposed to the lower temperatures, which did not separate healthy subjects from patients with peripheral vascular disease. A third experiment was done to study normal subjects and patients by using the finger circulation as control against the toe circulation when the conditions were a local skin temperature of 40 degrees C and a room temperature of 23 degrees C. A toe-finger index was established to detect abnormalities in the circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-four stable claudicants with long, collateralized femoropopliteal obstructions were treated with isovolemic hemodilution with 500 mL of 10% hydroxyethyl starch 200 and sham dilutions. Three weeks of hemodilution lowered blood and plasma viscosity, as well as hematocrit, and increased resting blood flow and pain-free walking distance. Placebo treatments produced no such favorable changes. It is concluded that hemodilution therapy can be clinically effective in patients with arterial obstructions in the lower extremities. Hemodilution seems particularly promising under hemodynamic condition of low shear stresses in vivo.\r"

This retrospective cohort study was designed to determine if the T40-ms axis could discriminate TCA-toxic patients from other overdose patients and whether a correlation exists between TCA plasma concentration and T40-ms axis rotation. Only symptomatic overdose patients with plasma and urine drug screens and an ECG obtained within two hours of each other were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: TCA overdose patients (TCA OD, n = 48) and nonTCA overdose patients (nonTCA OD, n = 30). The mean T40-ms axis was significantly more rightward in the TCA OD group compared with the nonTCA OD group (179 +/- 74 vs 86 +/- 87, P less than .001). A TCA OD patient was 8.6 times more likely to have a T40-ms axis of more than 120 degrees than was a nonTCA OD patient (odds ratio, 8.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 29.1). Eight of the TCA poisoned patients (17%) did not demonstrate a T40-ms axis between 120 degrees and 270 degrees. Receiver operating characteristics demonstrated that the T40-ms axis was a better indicator of TCA toxicity than the QRS interval (P less than .05). A T40-ms axis of 120 degrees or more was 83% sensitive and 63% specific for TCA overdose. A correlation between plasma TCA concentration and T40-ms axis deviation was not found (r = .04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The development of automatic firearm safety devices, promotion of hunter safety programs, and greater participation by the medical community in preventive measures may impact the problem. Similar efforts have already been influential in reducing other forms of accidental injury through promotion of seat-belt use, local motorcycle helmet laws, use of infant car seats, and, most recently, regulations regarding all-terrain vehicles.\r"

Inhibition of ciliary activity with the local anesthetic bupivacaine resulted in a saturable delay of transport (greater than 15 minutes), while exposure to the beta-adrenergic stimulator isoproterenol caused a significant increase in transport rate (79 +/- 7 seconds). Two inflammatory mediators commonly found in chronic middle ear effusions were also tested for their effect on fluid transport by the mucociliary apparatus. Bacterial endotoxin reduced transport rates at high concentrations, while prostaglandin E2 had no effect at any concentration tested.\r"

The MEE/plasma ratio of alpha 1-AT in SOM was significantly higher than that in POM (p less than .01) because of the high alpha 1-AT level in POM plasma. The ratio of both antitryptic activity and trypsin-binding activity in POM was significantly higher than that in SOM + POM (p less than .01, less than .05), and significantly lower than that in SOM (p less than .01). The majority of both inhibitors in SOM exists as the free state, and the reaction between proteases and inhibitors in POM and SOM + POM is more active than that in SOM. It is concluded that both alpha 1-AT and alpha 2-M appear to play an important role in the protection of middle ear mucosa by forming protease-inhibitor complexes to reduce proteolytic damage in POM and SOM + POM models.\r"

This study measured change in hepatic function (galactose elimination capacity [GEC]), liver blood flow (low dose galactose clearance: flow), hepatic volume (CT scan; volume) and morphology after OLT. The aim was to measure the physiologic response after OLT and compare this response with that after selective shunt (SS) and sclerotherapy (ES) to determine which patients should receive specific therapy. Between January 1987 and November 1988, 37 patients underwent OLT. Operative mortality was 18%, which was similar to that of SS in Child's C cirrhotics. GEC and volume were less in transplant patients than in cirrhotics treated with SS or ES. GEC, flow, and volume normalized after OLT; GEC was preserved after ES and SS, but volume decreased. Three preoperative patterns were observed that can aid in selection of OLT candidates. Patients with chronic cirrhosis (chronic active hepatitis; cryptogenic) need OLT when GEC is less than or equal to 225 mg/min and volume is less than or equal to 50% normal. Patients with Budd-Chiari Syndrome require OLT if cirrhosis has evolved. Patients with sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis qualify for transplants when complications of the portal hypertensive syndrome develop. The studies can also direct therapy for ES failures. Selective shunt is indicated in those patients with stable disease whose GEC is greater than or equal to 300 mg/min and liver volume is greater than 75% normal; OLT is indicated for cirrhotics with GEC that is less than 225 mg/min and liver volume that is less than 50% predicted normal.\r"

No differences in mortality could be demonstrated between therapies in adult patients older than 30 years of age or with a concomitant inhalation injury. Children (n = 259) with similar large burns treated by early excision showed a significant increase in mortality with increasing burn size and with concomitant inhalation injury (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The surgeon operating upon patients with primary or metastatic hepatic cancers must determine if resection is feasible and, if it is, the magnitude of required resection. In an attempt to determine which tests best aid the surgeon in these determinations, the authors prospectively compared preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the liver and intraoperative ultrasound (IOU) in 42 patients with liver tumors who underwent 45 exploratory operations. The primary diseases included colorectal cancer metastases in 27 patients, hepatoma in 11 patients, and metastatic cancers of other origins in 4 patients. In the 42 patients there were 89 identified hepatic lesions that were confirmed to be malignant by resection, biopsy, or continued growth on follow-up CT. The sensitivity of either test for detecting these lesions was 69/89 (77%) for CT and 87/89 (98%) for IOU. Resection was not feasible in 13 patients. Five had extrahepatic disease, 4 had more nodules discovered by IOU, 3 were found by IOU to have involvement of all three hepatic veins by tumor and 1 patient had portal-vein invasion. Alternatively, in four patients tumors thought to involve all three hepatic veins by CT were shown to be free of at least one hepatic vein, thereby permitting resection. In one patient who had been previously operated upon, a tumor thought to involve the remaining right hepatic vein was seen to be free of the vein, also permitting resection. Regarding the extent of resection, IOU was also helpful. Lesser procedures than anticipated were proved possible by IOU in seven patients. A more extensive resection was shown to be necessary by IOU in two patients. Thus, IOU affected the operative management in 22 of 45 operative episodes (49%). It was conclude that IOU is superior to both preoperative CT and surgical exploration in assessing both the feasibility and the extent of resection required for primary and secondary hepatic cancers. In the authors' experience, IOU is the most sensitive indicator of number of lesions present in the liver. In addition, the ability of IOU to determine hepatic venous anatomy is a helpful adjunct in determining resectability of liver tumors.\r"

All patients underwent surveillance with iodine 125-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography, with subsequent venography.

Proximal vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism occurred in 6 patients (9.2%) in the warfarin group, 7 patients (10.6%) in the aspirin group, and 19 patients (30.2%) in the placebo group. The results of this study show that sodium warfarin therapy is safe and effective in preventing thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing surgery for fractured hip, and that aspirin therapy is an equally safe and effective method for preventing proximal vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.\r"

In spite of their widespread use, little data about the frequency and spectrum of cutaneous reactions associated with these agents have been published. Based on reports provided to the FDA's Division of Epidemiology and Drug Surveillance, and the American Academy of Dermatology's Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting System, it appears that the frequency of adverse cutaneous events associated with these drugs is low, but that occasionally severe reactions are associated with the use of these drugs. Among the more serious reactions associated with the calcium channel blockers are toxic epidermal necrolysis with diltiazem, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, which have been associated with all three drugs in this class, and exfoliative dermatitis, which has also been reported with all three agents. Most serious reactions associated with these agents occur within two weeks of initiating drug therapy. These findings suggest that calcium channel blockers are occasional causes of a wide spectrum of cutaneous reactions and should be considered as possible causative factors in patients who develop adverse cutaneous reactions while using these drugs.\r"

Following randomization (open-label), timed urinary and plasma samples for clearance of urea and creatinine and excretion of sodium, potassium, and calcium were obtained as well as plasma renin activity for a two-hour collection prior to infusion, during a two-hour period of BP control (supine diastolic BP, 95 to 110 mm Hg), and following two hours off the drugs. Mean arterial pressure was lowered similarly with the two drugs (-22% on fenoldopam vs -20% on nitroprusside; P = NS), and neither plasma renin activity nor plasma aldosterone concentration were changed by either drug. However, patients receiving fenoldopam had significant increases in urinary flow and excretion of sodium, potassium, and calcium, whereas patients receiving nitroprusside had no changes in these parameters. Patients receiving fenoldopam had a net fluid balance of -334 mL from the end of baseline to the end of the treatment period, while the nitroprusside group had a positive balance of 382 mL. Thus, these findings show that acute BP reduction with fenoldopam is associated with both a diuresis and natriuresis in severely hypertensive patients while lowering BP with nitroprusside does not predictably alter renal function and causes a moderate expansion in volume.\r"

In contrast, protein-calorie malnutrition, while not strictly analogous to the protein-sparing characteristics often noted in anorexia nervosa, is a problem of global stature. Physiologic consequences of anorexia nervosa include rhythm disturbances, mitral valve prolapse, plus both systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. Diminished exercise capacity occurs in both states, with marked blunting of the heart rate and blood pressure response. Congestive heart failure may appear, especially during refeeding. In addition to the myofibrillar destruction associated with protein-calorie malnutrition, hypophosphatemia, particularly when exacerbated by unrestricted glucose-rich refeedings or hyperalimentation, may be one additional cause of ventricular dysfunction. A high level of suspicion for cardiovascular complications is, therefore, warranted in the evaluation and therapy of weight loss conditions such as starvation and anorexia nervosa.\r"

The sensitivity of the KDI Quik Test was 62.5%, specificity was 70%, predictive value of a negative test was 36%, and efficiency was 64%. In too many instances the KDI Quik Test did not detect the drugs for which it is intended. Paper chromatography tests such as the KDI Quik Test are inaccurate and as such are unacceptable in any setting for the purposes of screening for drugs of abuse.\r"

The observation of 19 malignancies in 17 of 60 patients with SMCD raised several questions regarding the chronological relationship of onset of SMCD and the malignancies, whether these patients are at increased risk for developing malignancy, and whether the distribution of solid vs hematologic malignancies indicates a relationship between SMCD and a particular tumor. The following malignancies were observed: eight solid tumors, seven acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, three malignant lymphomas, and one refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. The majority (13/17) of patients were found to have malignancies before, or within 12 months of, SMCD diagnosis. Statistical analysis suggested that patients with SMCD are not at increased risk for malignancies subsequent to the diagnosis of SMCD. The varied types of solid malignancies observed indicated a random distribution, in contrast to the hematologic malignancies that appeared to primarily affect the myeloid cells.\r"

The existence of desmin- and smooth-muscle actin-positive isolated spindle cells in SSTs and also in cortical stroma of the normal ovary was characteristically demonstrated, whereas such smooth-muscle-like cells were absent from six thecofibromas. Immunohistochemistry of desmin and smooth-muscle actin is useful in distinguishing SST from thecofibroma. Ultrastructural study further evidenced the presence of smooth-muscle-like cells in SSTs. In addition, we histochemically demonstrated heterogeneous cellular components in SSTs, including fibroblastic, thecalike, smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Hence, it is suggested that SST is derived from pluripotent immature stromal cells of the ovarian cortex.\r"

Proliferating cells expressing transferrin receptors (OKT9+ cells) were generally few or absent in CSF and not useful as a marker of disease activity in either MS or AM.\r"

These results suggest that the CDR 0.5 stage likely represents the incipient clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and that the majority of subjects with CDR 0.5 have \"very mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.\" Performance on several standard clinical scales was significantly different when comparing a larger sample of controls (n = 83), subjects with CDR 0.5 (n = 41), and subjects with mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (score of 1; n = 68).\r"

The time course of the clinical and electrophysiologic findings during provocation with chloroquine and the absence of autoantibodies indicate that the syndrome was due to a direct effect of the drug on the neuromuscular junction. While not taking chloroquine, the patient showed a decremental response on a modified double-step nerve stimulation test and a mean consecutive difference on single-fiber electromyography that was at the upper limit of normal, indicating a subclinical impairment of neuromuscular transmission. These findings can explain the apparent rarity of the syndrome described, as a direct effect of chloroquine on the neuromuscular junction may only have clinical relevance in patients with a reduced neuromuscular safety factor.\r"

Intracellular free calcium, implicated in vascular smooth muscle contraction, has been found to be elevated in platelets of other hypertensive disorders. We therefore measured intracellular free calcium concentrations by using the fluorescent probe quin-2 in platelets of six patients with preeclampsia and compared them to measurements in ten normotensive pregnant women and ten age-matched nonpregnant women. Intracellular free calcium was also determined in the preeclamptic women after delivery. We found that intracellular free calcium was slightly elevated in normal pregnancy (102 +/- 13 nmol/L v 87 +/- 17 nmol/L) but was markedly increased in preeclampsia (138 +/- 13 nmol/L, P less than .05). This increase disappeared six weeks after delivery (84 + 10 nmol/L, P less than .01). To investigate whether the increased intracellular free calcium was related to angiotensin II, the platelets were exposed to thrombin and angiotensin II in vitro. Exposure to thrombin and angiotensin II caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular free calcium. The intracellular response to thrombin was not significantly different in the three groups. However, stimulation with angiotensin II revealed an increased response in intracellular free calcium in preeclampsia (P less than .05) that disappeared after delivery. Our findings show a sustained increase in platelet intracellular free calcium in preeclampsia and suggest a functional alteration of the angiotensin II receptor in this disease.\r"

  ".U": "89207163\r", 
  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that a major site of production of angiotensin I and II is peripheral tissue. Both angiotensin I and II are present in venous blood in amounts far too high to be explained by their generation in blood alone, given the extensive conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and clearance of both peptides across peripheral tissues. Much indirect evidence supports this argument for angiotensin production in tissues, and indicates that tissue production of angiotensin plays an important role in regulation of blood pressure. Tissue renin may represent uptake from plasma and/or local synthesis, but despite the ease with which renin-like activity can be measured in tissues, its interpretation is problematic because of interference by nonrenin enzymes and inadvertent activation of inactive renin. Moreover, given that enzymes other than renin are able to liberate angiotensin I and angiotensin II from angiotensinogen, there is no obligatory role for renin in angiotensin production in tissues. Inasmuch as tissue production is the major source of plasma angiotensin, the fall in plasma angiotensin levels after bilateral nephrectomy indicates that kidney-derived renin is the major contributor to tissue angiotensin production. This argument is supported by evidence that vascular renin-like activity is kidney-derived, and plays a dominant role in angiotensin-dependent pressor mechanisms. Near-normal levels of inactive renin in plasma of anephric subjects indicates extrarenal synthesis of inactive renin, and renin mRNA has been identified in various nonrenal tissues. Whether these tissues are also able to process inactive renin to active renin, and its role in local angiotensin production and blood pressure regulation, are currently being investigated.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of immunoreactive \"angiotensin II\" in plasma cannot provide an accurate reflection of the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition because different angiotensin fragments interfere in all radioimmunoassays available so far. More complex methods are necessary in order to measure specifically angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide. With such methodology it can be shown that no tolerance develops to the angiotensin II-reducing effect of ACE inhibitors after prolonged administration. Marked reduction of angiotensin II levels can be shown even in patients with primary aldosteronism. At peak blockade, the level of plasma angiotensin II is still related to circulating active renin and angiotensin I. Accordingly, because ACE inhibitors raise circulating angiotensin I in a dose-dependent fashion, this should be taken into account when dosing ACE inhibitors. The hypothesis that tissue renin-angiotensin systems play an important independent role in determining vasomotor tone is very interesting. However, any discussion on whether tissue or plasma renin determines the pharmacological effect of ACE inhibitors should be based on the simultaneous measurement of true angiotensin II in tissue and plasma under steady-state conditions.\r"

Using radiolabeled cRNA probes prepared from specific cDNA fragments, we were able to document renin and angiotensinogen gene expression in atria and ventricles of the rat heart by Northern blot and liquid hybridization analysis. Relative signal strength for both mRNAs was highest in the atria and next highest in the right and left ventricle. We also demonstrated the presence of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II in all anatomical regions of the monkey and rat heart using specific, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) controlled radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for angiotensin peptides. The presence of converting-enzyme activity was also ascertained by direct in vitro determinations. Infusion of angiotensin I into the isolated perfused rat heart resulted in the prompt appearance of angiotensin II; the single pass fractional conversion was 6.42 +/- 0.33%. Dose-dependent inhibition of this effect by simultaneous infusion of converting-enzyme inhibitor supports the existence of a specific intracardiac pathway for the activation of angiotensin II. When the isolated, perfused rat hearts were exposed to infusions of purified renin, angiotensin I, undetectable before renin, was dose-dependently released into the coronary circulation at peak rates ranging from 2.4 +/- 0.7 fmol/min to 1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol/min, of which 7.2 +/- 1.1% was intracardially converted to angiotensin II. All renin effects were blocked in the presence of a specific pentapeptide renin inhibitor. Together, the results of these studies add support to the concept of a functionally active cardiac tissue renin-angiotensin system.\r"

  ".W": "Specific renin has been identified in the outer layers of the adrenals of rat, mouse, and human and the inner cortical layers but not in the medulla of mouse adrenals. Nephrectomy causes a marked elevation of adrenal renin, presumably through hyperkalemia. The subcellular distribution of adrenal renin was investigated by Percoll density gradient. The renin activity in the dense granules from the capsules of nephrectomized rats was 15 times greater than that of intact rat. Most of the active form renin was found in dense renin granules. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the dense granules increased in number after bilateral nephrectomy. Immunogold staining of these granules showed unequivocally the presence of renin therein. Adrenal capsules in organ culture were found to release renin at a steady rate. Renin release from bilaterally nephrectomized rat adrenals was 46 times greater than from the organs of intact animals. The mechanism of the control of renin secretion from the adrenal gland was different from the kidney in that the secretion was stimulated by potassium chloride (10 mol/L) or angiotensin II (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) but not by ACTH (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L), suggesting stimulation by intracellular calcium. These results provide evidence that the adrenal synthesizes renin, stores it in specific secretory granules, and secretes it in a regulated manner. Prorenin in the adrenal tissue accounted for only 10% of the total renin whereas 90% of the secreted renin was inactive.\r"

The gonadotropes also contain renin-like and angiotensin-converting enzyme-like immunoreactivity, but angiotensinogen-like immunoreactivity is found in a separate population of cells and does not colocalize with any of the known anterior pituitary hormones. This suggests that angiotensinogen shuttles to the gonadotropes in a paracrine fashion. There are angiotensin II receptors on lactotropes and corticotropes, but no definite function has been established for pituitary angiotensin II in the regulation of prolactin and adrenocorticotropic hormone.\r"

These three contact points allow for stability of the bony graft and account for the name tripod. The method was applied in 30 ears and was successful in all but three cases. All the rest (ie, 27 ears) achieved an average gain of 24.8 dB, leaving an average air-bone gap of 11.1 dB. The postoperative air-bone gap was 20 dB or less in all 27 ears that were successfully operated on; and in 21 of them (77.8%), it was no more than 10 dB. The average period of follow-up was 23.8 months. Operative success depended on both the technique chosen and the favorable selection of cases.\r"

After these initial doses, when incremental doses were given there was no sign of cumulation of effect. Antagonism of block with edrophonium 1 mg kg-1, whilst fast in onset, was rarely complete; with neostigmine 50 micrograms kg-1 antagonism was satisfactory.

Second, the evidence for a raised prevalence of unfixed reference in dyslexics is reviewed and contradictory findings are discussed. Third, it is argued that there is little support for the view that dyslexics with unfixed reference make different types of reading errors from those with fixed reference: indeed many dyslexics with unfixed reference have non-visual, phonological difficulties. Finally, it is argued that studies which claim that monocular occlusion is a successful treatment for 'visual dyslexia' are methodologically flawed and do not provide convincing evidence for this view.\r"

A 12-month prospective randomized controlled trial compared gold and hydroxychloroquine in 52 patients to gold and placebo in 49. The patients continued to receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics. They were selected from three rheumatology centres in the West Midlands. Combination therapy led to a greater number of withdrawals due to adverse reactions (18 cases compared to 10 receiving gold/placebo). Patients completing 12 months' therapy (27 taking gold/hydroxychloroquine and 32 on gold/placebo) were compared using five clinical, seven laboratory, and one radiological measure. All 13 variables favoured gold/hydroxychloroquine with an overall advantage of 20-25% for the combination. This only reached statistical significance (at the 1% level) for C-reactive protein. An overall disease activity index was better at 12 months (at the 5% level) and showed a more rapid response with gold/hydroxychloroquine. This is the first randomized prospective placebo-controlled trial to show a significant advantage from a combination of two slow-acting drugs. There are many different ways of giving such combinations and we consider these should be explored to maximize the effectiveness of treatment for RA.\r"

Corticosteroid use, need for hemodialysis and number of days of hemodialysis were significantly greater among the cases. Logistic regression analysis identified corticosteroid dosage and number of days of hemodialysis as independent risk factors. Lymphopenia and monocytopenia were correlated with the amount of corticosteroid administered and occurred to a greater degree in the cases. All clinical isolates were of L. pneumophila serogroup 1, subtype Philadelphia 1, which was also cultured from a recovery room sink outside the operating room where the transplants were done. Other areas of the hospital were colonized with other, heterogeneous strains of L. pneumophila. The organism was not eliminated from the hospital water supply despite shock chlorination and superheating of water tanks. The epidemic ended when new transplant recipients routinely received prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160-800 mg given orally once daily) while in hospital after transplantation. Corticosteroid-induced monocytopenia and lymphopenia and the complement activation and monocyte depletion effects of hemodialysis may combine to increase susceptibility to Legionnaires' disease.\r"

  ".W": "Simultaneous recordings of airway pressure, pleural pressure, and right ventricular (RV) pressure were obtained during mechanically controlled ventilation in a group of patients requiring respiratory support. Changes in transpulmonary pressure (calculated as airway pressure minus pleural pressure) were measured at end-expiration and end-inspiration during intermittent positive pressure ventilation with or without the application of a positive end-expiratory pressure, and were related to RV isovolumetric pressure changes at the onset of systole. It was found that any increase in transpulmonary pressure by intermittent positive pressure ventilation, or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), or both, was associated with a proportional increase in RV isovolumetric pressure change. Moreover, when lung volume was progressively increased by incremental increases in tidal volume or PEEP level, transpulmonary pressure and RV isovolumetric pressure changes were strongly and linearly correlated. These results suggest that: 1) RV isovolumetric pressure change might be used as an index of RV output impedance during respiratory support by mechanically controlled ventilation; and 2) lung inflation resulting from the use of a positive airway pressure during respiratory support can increase RV output impedance and thereby contribute to the decrease in RV stroke output.\r"

Patients in Group II received the same dose of the same solution in increments of 5 ml injected through a catheter after a 3 ml test-dose. Each increment was injected in one minute with a delay of two minutes between injections. Top-up doses were given in both groups to obtain a T4 sensory level. There was no difference between the two groups in the quality of sensory block before delivery. However, the quality was significantly better in Group II after delivery (P = 0.02). The incidence of hypotension was 52.2 per cent in Group I and 13.6 per cent in Group II (P = 0.014). There was no significant difference in maternal and umbilical venous lidocaine concentrations.

Time to the onset of sleep was determined by a blinded observer and venous blood samples obtained 15, 30, 45 and 120 minutes following drug administration. Fifty of 60 children were asleep within 15 minutes. Nine of the ten children that did not fall asleep were sedate and could be separated easily from their parents to undergo inhalational induction of anesthesia. Time to the onset of sleep was inversely related to the dose of rectal methohexitone administered. Sleep was achieved more reliably following the use of 25 to 30 mg.kg-1 rectal methohexitone. In addition, plasma methohexitone concentrations following 30 mg.kg-1 rectal methohexitone were significantly higher for up to 120 minutes following drug administration than the plasma concentrations achieved after 15 mg.kg-1 or 20 mg.kg-1 methohexitone. There was no difference in the incidence of complications. The authors recommend that clinical circumstances be carefully considered and the dose of rectal methohexitone administered be individualized to meet the specific anaesthetic requirements of each child.\r"

  ".W": "In nearly 25 years of clinical experience, the benefits and limitations of ketamine analgesia and anaesthesia have generally been well-defined. The extensive review of White et al. and the cardiovascular review of Reves et al. are broad in their scope and have advanced the understanding of dissociative anaesthesia. Nevertheless, recent research continues to illuminate different aspects of ketamine pharmacology, and suggests new clinical uses for this drug. The identification of the N-methylaspartate receptor gives further support to the concept that ketamine's analgesic and anaesthetic effects are mediated by separate mechanisms. The stereospecific binding of (+)ketamine to opiate receptors in vitro, more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, and the lower incidence of emergence sequelae, make (+)ketamine a promising drug for future research. Clinical applications of ketamine that have emerged recently, and are likely to increase in the future, are the use of oral, rectal, and intranasal preparations for the purposes of analgesia, sedation, and anaesthetic induction. Ketamine is now considered a reasonable option for anaesthetic induction in the hypotensive preterm neonate. The initial experience with epidural and intrathecal ketamine administration has not been very promising but the data are only preliminary in this area. The use of ketamine in military and catastrophic settings is likely to become more common. The clinical availability of midazolam will complement ketamine anaesthesia in several ways. This rapidly metabolized benzodiazepine reduces ketamine's cardiovascular stimulation and emergence phenomena, and does not have active metabolites. It is dispensed in an aqueous medium, which is usually non-irritating on intravenous injection, unlike diazepam. The combination of ketamine and midazolam is expected to achieve high patient acceptance, which never occurred with ketamine as a sole agent. Finally, it is necessary to point out the potential for abuse of ketamine. While ketamine is not a controlled substance (in the United States), the prudent physician should take appropriate precautions against the unauthorized use of this drug.\r"

In epidemiology, Snow investigated the relationship of water supplies to mortality in cholera during the London epidemic in 1854, which led him to formulate an original and valid theory of the transmission of cholera. Snow's research, which has received less attention than anecdotes concerning his career (e.g., his anaesthetizing Queen Victoria and urging removal of the handle of a contaminated water pump), was always directed towards solving specific problems. The significance of his research is evident in its leading not only to improvements in health care but also to the evolution of anaesthesia and epidemiology as professional disciplines.\r"

The linearity, reproducibility, and relations with regional myocardial perfusion and conventional time-density curve parameters, time to peak concentration (TPC), and exponential washout rate (k) were assessed in a dynamic flow x-ray phantom (n = 46) and in six open-chest dogs (n = 102) while coronary flow was altered by stenosis and/or hyperemic stimuli. In the phantom studies, the inverse of the system mean transit time (Tsys-1) closely predicted flow/volume (r = 0.99, slope = 0.99). In dogs, Tsys-1 was independent of the shape of the contrast bolus injection (single or double-peaked), class of contrast agent (ionic or nonionic), the type of hyperemic stimulus (dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus norepinephrine, transient total occlusion, or ionic contrast media), and was highly reproducible between adjacent myocardial regions served by the same artery (r = 0.98 +/- 0.01). There was a strong correlation between Tsys-1 and regional coronary flow for stenotic and/or hyperemic vessels (r = 0.94, distribution volume = 14.9 ml/100 g) over a wide range (0-514 ml/min/100 g). Tsys-1 performed better than conventional time-density curve parameters TPC-1 and k for predicting phantom flow/volume ratios and regional myocardial blood flow in the dog. These data suggest that both digital coronary angiography and coronary contrast transit can be modeled as linear systems and that impulse response analysis may provide accurate and reproducible estimates of regional myocardial blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to investigate the anisotropy of systolic chord shortening in the lateral, inferior, septal, and anterior regions of the human left ventricle. At the time of surgery, 12 miniature radiopaque markers were implanted into the left ventricular midwall of the donor heart in 15 cardiac transplant recipients. Postoperative biplane cineradiograms were computer-analyzed to yield the three-dimensional coordinates of these markers at 16.7-msec intervals. In each of the four left ventricular regions, chords were constructed from a central marker to outlying markers, and the percent systolic shortening of each chord was calculated. In each region, chord angles were measured with respect to the circumferential direction (positive angles counterclockwise) and each chord was assigned to one of four angular groups: I. oblique, -45 +/- 22.5 degrees or 135 +/- 22.5 degrees; II. circumferential, 0 +/- 22.5 degrees or 180 +/- 22.5 degrees; III. oblique, 45 +/- 22.5 degrees or -135 +/- 22.5 degrees; or IV. longitudinal, 90 +/- 22.5 degrees. In the lateral, inferior, and septal regions, respectively, systolic shortening (mean +/- SD%) was significantly greater in Group I chords (19 +/- 5%, 17 +/- 5%, and 15 +/- 4%) than those in Group II (15 +/- 5%, 12 +/- 4%, and 11 +/- 4%), Group III (12 +/- 4%, 12 +/- 5%, and 11 +/- 4%), or Group IV (13 +/- 5%, 13 +/- 6%, and 12 +/- 5%). The anterior region was unique in exhibiting equal shortening in both Group I and Group II chords (16 +/- 5%), although the shortening of these chords was significantly greater than that of Group III and Group IV (12 +/- 5%) in this region. A cylindrical mathematical model was developed to relate longitudinal, circumferential, and oblique systolic shortening to torsional deformation about the long axis of the left ventricle. Torsional deformations measured in these 15 hearts were of sufficient magnitude and correct sense to agree with model predictions. These data suggest that torsional deformations of the left ventricle are of fundamental importance in linking the one-dimensional contraction of the helically wound myocytes to the three-dimensional anisotropic systolic shortening encountered in the transplanted human heart.\r"

The hypothesis that CPM should stimulate pluripotential mesenchymal cells to differentiate into articular cartilage and should accelerate the healing of articular tissues has been validated by numerous scientific investigations of a variety of experimental models of the knee joint. These models have included full-thickness defects, intraarticular fractures, acute septic arthritis, partial thickness lacerations of the patellar tendon, semitendinosus tenodesis to replace the medial collateral ligament, autogeneic osteoperiosteal grafts in major defects, free autogeneic periosteal grafts, and periosteal allografts. In 1978, the author collaborated with Saringer, an engineer, to develop CPM devices for humans. CPM is clinically indicated following such procedures as open reduction of fractures, arthrolysis for posttraumatic arthritis, synovectomy, drainage of septic arthritis, release of joint contractures, total arthroplasty, tendon repair, and ligament reconstruction. Clinically, CPM is an important stimulus to joint regeneration processes.\r"

Complications included superficial wound infections in two patients, transient stiffness of the shoulder in two patients, loss of range of movement in one patient, and subjective weakness in one patient.

Numerous modalities have been explored, and this review formulates strategies to prevent this potentially lethal complication. While minidose heparin and anti-platelet agents may provide effective thromboembolism protection for some patients, their effect in patients treated with hip surgery is limited. Dextran 40 is useful in younger patients treated with hip arthroplasty who are at risk for bleeding complications and who can tolerate volume overload. Heparin dihydroergotamine is an alternative to oral anticoagulants and may cause fewer bleeding complications than oral anticoagulants. Low molecular weight heparin and adjusted-dose heparin can also be used effectively in hip surgery. Warfarin is perhaps the most effective regimen when the prothrombin time is maintained at 1.2-1.5 times control. The risk of thrombosis for patients treated with either emergency or elective hip surgery is significant, and numerous additional factors can increase the likelihood of this complication. The best approach to this problem is prevention, which is effective, safe, and economical.\r"

Some patients, however, have such severe pain and disability and frequent need for clotting factor replacement that reconstructive surgery is required.

Of these, 141 were primary procedures and 27 were reoperations for persisting or recurring symptoms, failed prostheses, and infection. End-result analysis at the latest follow-up examination indicates that all patients are improved in terms of recurrent hemarthroses and pain, and all but two are improved in terms of function. Results are analyzed and compared with existing reports in the world literature in order to determine appropriate indications for surgery and which procedures are most successful.\r"

DMD must be diagnosed early, not only to enable genetic counseling concerning future pregnancy and screening of female siblings, but also to stage physical therapy to delay muscle contracture. Surgery, when indicated, should anticipate realistic functional goals (standing, walking, transfer), and enable immediate postoperative mobilization. Bracing should be suitably provided and orthoses appropriately constructed to assure maximal support with minimal weight. Spinal deformity must be prevented when feasible and appropriately treated when present. Maximal function in wheelchair-confined patients can be enhanced through the use of an apparatus that encourages proper sitting posture and utilizes residual strength. Complications must be anticipated and vigorously treated. Attention should be paid to the psychic as well as the somatic aspects of this disease. Optimal treatment of the patient with DMD should be multidisciplinary, aggressive, and conducted in an atmosphere of intelligent concern. This approach minimizes the frustrating aspects of DMD while it maximizes the benefits obtained through available care. In this manner, the quality of life for the patient with muscular dystrophy can be significantly enhanced and his life expectancy extended.\r"

One hundred ninety-one patients with the sepsis syndrome were evaluated prospectively and comprised the placebo group of a multicenter trial of methylprednisolone in sepsis syndrome and septic shock. Forty-five percent of the patients were found to be bacteremic. Thirty-six percent of the patients were in septic shock (sepsis syndrome plus a systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease from baseline in systolic BP greater than 40 mm Hg) on study entry. An additional 23% of the patients developed shock after admission with 70% doing so within 24 h of study entry. Shock reversal occurred with a 73% frequency. Twenty-five percent of the patients developed the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality for the patients with sepsis syndrome who did not develop shock was 13%. Mortality for the groups of patients with shock on admission and shock postadmission was 27.5% and 43.2%, respectively.

Information is obtained from the size, shape, and changes in shape of the velocity waveforms of descending aortic blood flow. Minute distance, the product of waveform area (stroke distance) and heart rate, provides a measure of cardiac output. Good agreement between this technique and thermodilution was shown for cardiac output changes with 238 paired measurements made in 38 patients. The coefficient of variation was lower for Doppler (3.8%) than for simultaneous thermodilution measurements (6.2%). Seventy-eight changes in left ventricular filling, systemic vascular resistance, or inotropic state produced consistent alterations in waveform shape with a narrow-based waveform being indicative of hypovolemia. This development marks a significant advance in the technique and provides a useful alternative to invasive hemodynamic monitoring, both in the ICU and perioperatively.\r"

Complications of diverticular disease, including perforation and hemorrhage, may occur in 15% to 20% of patients with diverticula during their lifetime, and although often mild and self-limiting diseases, they too frequently cause life-threatening problems that require prompt surgical intervention. Despite a cadre of sophisticated laboratory and radiologic tests that have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of complicated diverticular disease, the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis still relies heavily on patient history, physical examination, physician judgment, and the patient's clinical response to treatment. Thus it is important for the managing physician to fully understand the pathogenesis of diverticula, the clinical consequences and modes of presentation of complicated diverticular disease, and the array of interventions available for treatment of these problems. This monograph summarizes our knowledge of diverticular disease to date and tries to give specific guidelines for the treatment of patients with complicated diverticulitis. However, it must be understood that the presentation and severity of these complications vary widely from patient to patient. Thus one cannot take a single approach toward a patient who has diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding. Rather, successful outcomes depend on an individual approach to each patient while maintaining certain generally accepted principles of treatment.\r"

However, using routine bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), histamine can be detected in only a portion of asthmatic subjects and a minority of control populations. To obtain relevant mediators from the airways in higher concentrations by avoiding the dilution inherent with a standard BAL, a technique was developed to lavage isolated airway segments of the human lung that employed a double-lumen bronchoscope and a balloon-tipped catheter. Lavage fluid obtained by this method yielded significantly higher concentrations of histamine than that obtained with routine BAL (asthmatic subjects, 2,403 +/- 633 pg/ml vs 188 +/- 42 pg/ml; rhinitis subjects, 533 +/- 187 pg/ml vs 113 +/- 53 pg/ml; normal subjects, 174 +/- 63 pg/ml vs 11 +/- 11 pg/ml). Similar findings were also noted for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Segmental airway lavage also resulted in higher lavage fluid concentrations of LTB, than routine BAL. Segmental airway lavage should help in studying the relationship of mast cell degranulation to airways reactivity in both asthmatic and other study populations.\r"

Since polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are thought to play an important role in septic or TNF-induced MOD, we investigated both neutrophil sufficient (PMN+) and neutropenic (PMN-) guinea pigs. Sepsis was induced by Escherichia coli administration (2 x 10(9)/kg) or recombinant human TNF (1.4 x 10(6) U/kg) was infused into PMN+ and PMN- guinea pigs. During necropsy, the PMN+/TNF and PMN+/E coli animals exhibited marked damage in the adrenal glands, kidneys and liver as evidenced by hemorrhage, congestion, and PMN sequestration on histopathologic examination. There was also increased tissue albumin accumulation in the adrenal glands, kidneys, spleen, heart, and liver as demonstrated by 125I-labeled albumin determinations. In contrast, the PMN-/TNF group did not reveal histopathologic damage in any organ system and there was no abnormal organ accumulation of 125I-albumin. However, in PMN-/E coli animals, marked histopathologic damage in the adrenal glands and liver was evident. Furthermore, there were marked accumulations of 125I-albumin in the adrenals, heart, kidneys, liver, and spleen. Moreover, the PMN-/E coli guinea pigs had a much greater accumulation (p less than 0.01) of 125I-albumin in the kidneys than any other group including the PMN+/E coli group. Thus, nonpulmonary MOD in guinea pigs is caused by TNF administration and can be prevented by PMN depletion. However, while E coli administration also caused marked nonpulmonary MOD in neutrophil sufficient guinea pigs, equivalent or greater damage was produced in neutropenic animals. This suggests that while TNF-induced MOD may be primarily mediated by PMN, E coli-induced MOD seems to be mediated by more than PMN.\r"

Transbronchial needle aspiration has brought into focus the importance of good cytopathologic support. The addition of histologic specimens (for light and electron microscopy) with the newer large-bore needles may further increase the utility of transbronchial needle aspiration. Both techniques are limited, in part, by the lack of distal tip deflection of the sampling instrument for steering accurately to peripheral masses. Tip deflection may have been partly responsible for the good yields reported for the double-hinged curet on small nodules, although the bronchographic map was also a factor. A steerable brush was described several years ago, but it was somewhat difficult to accurately maneuver, and long-term results were never reported. As yet, no easy answer is available for this problem. In the future, new generations of ultrathin bronchoscopes may permit much more accurate placement of sampling devices in the periphery of the lung and will represent an exciting diagnostic advance.\r"

  ".W": "A 62-year-old woman presented with a history of hoarseness. Although stable for ten years, she recently showed signs of deterioration. Investigations revealed left vocal cord paralysis and a large left atrial tumor displacing the left pulmonary artery under the arch of the aorta. The lesion was removed and the normal aortopulmonary window on computed tomography (CT) scan was restored. On review of the literature, this case appears to be the first to suggest that myxomas cause recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy through direct effects.\r"

The patient improved rapidly with specific antibiotic therapy, emphasizing the importance of considering this otherwise highly lethal syndrome in any individual who becomes critically ill after an initial influenzalike illness.\r"
