Sixteen adult subjects with asthma in a clinical steady state underwent 3 isocapnic cold air challenges on 3 consecutive days at a time when they had not received oral theophylline medication over the past 3 days. The dose of cold air causing a 20% (PD20) fall in FEV1 was obtained from each subject's dose-response curve. Subjects were then administered active or placebo sustained-release theophylline preparations according to a double-blind, randomized, two-treatment crossover design. Medication was given for a minimum of 3 consecutive days. PD20 was reassessed on 4 different days, 3 to 4 h after receiving active or placebo medication (two visits for each medication). We found a significant bronchodilator effect of theophylline as compared to the placebo (mean +/- SD differences in changes of FEV1 of 8.8 +/- 1.9%). We also documented a significant blocking effect of the active medication as opposed to the placebo on PD20 (p = 0.01). This difference (mean = 0.18 on the loge scale) was statistically beyond the intraindividual between-day variability observed on the 3 control days (p less than 0.001) but was physiologically minimal. This blocking effect was also partially related to changes in airway caliber. We conclude that theophylline showed a blocking effect on bronchial responsiveness to dry cold air, which was physiologically minimal and was partially related to changes in airway caliber.\r"

After i.v. PAF, the ED100 for acetylcholine and histamine was 5.4 and 3.4 micrograms/kg, respectively, in comparison with 17 and 6 micrograms/kg, respectively, before PAF, representing approximately a 3- and 2-fold increase in responsiveness, respectively. After aerosol PAF (500 micrograms), the ED100 for acetylcholine and histamine was 13 and 7 micrograms/kg, respectively, whereas after aerosolized BSA, the ED100 for acetylcholine and histamine was 23 and 12 micrograms/kg, respectively, representing approximately a 2-fold increase in responsiveness. However, airway smooth muscle obtained from these PAF- or BSA-treated animals did not exhibit any differences in contractile response to histamine or acetylcholine in vitro. Likewise, there were not significant differences in the binding affinity or receptor density between PAF- and BSA-treated tissues with [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate or [3H]pyrilamine binding, which were used to identify muscarinic and H1-histamine receptors, respectively. Furthermore, histamine and carbachol-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was similar in PAF- and BSA-treated tracheal smooth muscle preparations. Thus, PAF induces airway hyperresponsiveness in the guinea pig that is not related to changes in airway smooth muscle or to changes in muscarinic and histamine (H1) receptor density or function.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether prior histamine bronchoconstriction reduces airway responsiveness to inhaled acetylcholine in mild asthmatic subjects demonstrating histamine tachyphylaxis. All subjects developed histamine tachyphylaxis with repeated histamine challenge. The mean histamine PC20 increased from 3.74 to 5.92 mg/ml (p less than 0.005) when the histamine challenges were separated by 1 h. Prior acetylcholine bronchoconstriction did not reduce airway responsiveness to subsequent inhalation of either acetylcholine or histamine in these subjects. However, histamine inhalation did reduce airway responsiveness to acetylcholine in all subjects. The mean acetylcholine PC20 following acetylcholine inhalation was 3.37 mg/ml (%SD 2.17) and this increased to 7.76 mg/ml (%SD 1.80) after histamine inhalation (p less than 0.0005). Thus, this study demonstrates that prior histamine, but not acetylcholine, bronchoconstriction can partially protect against bronchoconstriction caused by both histamine and acetylcholine. Therefore, reduced airway responsiveness caused by histamine bronchoconstriction is specific for histamine and is not due to bronchoconstriction per se. However, the reduced airway responsiveness following histamine bronchoconstriction, is nonspecific.\r"

  ".U": "89075188\r", 
  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that activation of airway C-fibers, besides causing afferent transmission, also causes release of transmitters from peripheral endings, probably via local axon reflexes, resulting in effects on vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, i.e., vasodilatation, increase in vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction. In the present study, the release of tachykinins was investigated in the perfused guinea pig lung by various ways of neuronal activation. Substance-P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) and neurokinin-A-like immunoreactivity (NKA-LI) was determined by radioimmunoassay in the perfusates. A significantly increased outflow of both SP-LI and NKA-LI was observed during perfusion of the lung with high potassium concentration (60 mM), the C-fiber activator capsaicin (1 microM), bradykinin (1 microM), histamine (100 microM), or the nicotinic agonist dimethylphenyl piperazinium (DMPP) (32 microM). Release of both SP-LI and NKA-LI could also be achieved by electrical stimulation of vagal nerves. The percental increase varied from 80 to 1,000% depending on the kind of stimulus. The release of tachykinins by K+ or capsaicin was greatly reduced in calcium-free medium. Release by histamine was completely inhibited by 1 microM mepyramine, and release by DMPP was abolished by 20 microM hexamethonium. High performance liquid chromatography indicated that NKA-LI consisted of several cross-reacting substances, presumably other peptides of the tachykinin family. Among the isolated mammalian tachykinins, NKA was the most potent one to contract tracheal smooth muscle of guinea pigs in vitro, followed by neurokinin B and by SP. Both NKA and SP relaxed the guinea pig pulmonary artery with similar potency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that this phenomenon was related to a change in the balance of antagonistic receptor activity. The protocol consisted of 5 consecutive dose-response maneuvers (DR I to V) to 1 amine in each animal separated by 1 h. Once the loss of the initial vasoconstrictor activity had occurred (DR I to IV), the animal was given a receptor blocking agent, either the beta blocker propranolol or the H2 blocker cimetidine, prior to a final dose-response maneuver (DR V). The dose-response relationships were analyzed in terms of 3 parameters: maximum response, slope, and ED50. All the experiments with norepinephrine (n = 6), epinephrine (n = 10), and histamine (n = 25) demonstrated a progressive loss of vasopressor activity as shown by reductions in the maximum response and slope between DR I to IV. In addition, histamine demonstrated a significant increase in ED50 from DR I to IV, which suggested a loss of sensitivity. The loss of vasoconstrictor activity to histamine and the catecholamines was restored by the administration of propranolol prior to DR V. In contrast, cimetidine did not restore the initial vasopressor activity of histamine. The loss of reactivity to histamine was not secondary to changes in circulating catecholamine levels, because the plasma catecholamine levels before DR I and immediately following DR V in a subset of animals (n = 5) were within the reported normal range for this species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to see whether chelation of free iron reduced tissue damage induced by intratracheal bleomycin, deferoxamine (DFO) was administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion to overcome its rapid renal excretion. Thirty-three rats received DFO and 30 rats received an equivalent volume of saline by 7-day infusion pumps. Three days after commencement of infusion, half of each group received intratracheal bleomycin, the remainder received intratracheal saline. Three weeks after intratracheal injection, the rats were killed and their lungs were removed for histologic and morphometric assessment and collagen estimation. When compared with animals given intratracheal saline, both bleomycin-treated groups had significant evidence of lung toxicity, but DFO was not protective. Similarly, DFO infusion did not reduce the elevation in collagen concentration (bleomycin/saline, 49 +/- 3.6; bleomycin/DFO, 49.8 +/- 4.1; saline/saline, 39.6 +/- 3.9; saline/DFO, 43.4 +/- 3.8 mg.g-1 wet lung weight) or total lung collagen (bleomycin/saline, 29.9 +/- 6.3; bleomycin/DFO, 33.7 +/- 1.8; saline/saline, 15.5 +/- 2.2; saline/DFO, 17.8 +/- 1.9 mg.left lung-1) induced by bleomycin. This lack of effect was not due to iron contamination of the DFO in the pump or to loss of chelation capacity of DFO, at least for as long as 6 days after pump implantation. No DFO was detected in homogenized lung tissue (limits of detection of assay was 8 x 10(-5) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This ELF TGF-beta had similar physical characteristics to purified human platelet TGF-beta, competed with platelet TGF-beta for its receptor on A549 carcinoma cells, and stimulated the anchorage-independent growth of NRK cells in soft agar in the presence of epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, ELF TGF-beta suppressed diploid lung fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion similar to platelet TGF-beta. In the context of these observations and with the known biologic properties of this molecule, TGF-beta in ELF has the potential to play a role in a variety of cellular processes in the lower respiratory tract.\r"

We obtained reproducible lung water distribution data at comparable lung volumes in normal excised lungs and in intact living rats. In normal excised unperfused rat lungs, the distribution varied with the degree of inflation, but the changes were small compared with those associated with lung edema. The lung water density distribution changed markedly after induction of lung edema by intrabronchial saline instillation, intravenous oleic acid injection, and rapid intravenous saline infusion. Lung water density distribution data were well correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.948 for the excised lungs and 0.823 for the intact living rats) with gravimetric lung water measurements. The new analytical method is noninvasive, provides easily repeatable measurements, and is as sensitive as the gravimetric technique to lung water changes.\r"

Numbers of particles in airway epithelia and walls were counted in histologic sections of one lung, and the other lung was analyzed chemically for iron content. In both smoke-exposed and nonexposed groups, the chemically determined concentration of iron in the lung tissue decreased between 1 day and 1 month; however, the concentration of iron was significantly greater in the smoke-exposed group at 1 day and 1 wk. By 1 month, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. The number of particles in the epithelia of respiratory bronchioles also decreased in both smoke-exposed and nonexposed groups between 1 day and 1 month, but the smoke-exposed group had significantly more intraepithelial particles at 1 day and 1 wk than did the nonexposed group. The number of particles in the walls of respiratory bronchioles increased between 1 day and 1 month in both smoke-exposed and nonexposed groups; the difference between these groups was significant only at 1 wk, when airway walls of the smoke-exposed animals contained more particles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximal flow at constant lung volume was not significantly increased. Arterial O2 and CO2 tensions were not significantly different. Rebreathing DLCO normalized for lung volume was unchanged. The slope of phase III of a single-breath nitrogen test was increased (p less than 0.05) after surgery. Unilateral surgical obliteration of the pleural space results in a pure restrictive pattern. It does not affect the gas exchange surface. The increase in the slope of phase III is suggestive of a nonhomogeneous distribution of ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "Expiratory valves are the major source of resistance in ventilator circuits. Some valves, particularly under certain conditions, cause high resistances. To establish the mechanisms of expiratory valve resistance (R), we measured R of 4 commercial valves under several experimental conditions. The pressure above the diaphragm of one of the valves was also measured. The results reveal that all valves produce significant resistance to air outflow. This resistance is the result of the physical and functional interplay of several valve components. (1) In most valves, the dimensions of the air pathway through the valve contribute minimally to resistance in spite of its tortuosity. (2) The diaphragm adds a major contribution to valve resistance particularly at low flows. The diaphragm effect has 2 components: its weight--a gravity-dependent, fixed effect most predominant at very low flows and evident in all the valves--and a spring-like effect--a component related to the resistance of the diaphragm to deformation and of variable magnitude in different valves. Because of diaphragm-related components at low flows, valves behave as variable threshold resistors. (3) There is limitation to air egress from above the diaphragm at higher exhaled flows, which further contributes to valve resistance. The first and last components cause the valves to function also as flow resistors. Constant flows effectively counteract the diaphragm spring-like effect. Measuring valve resistance during constant flow underestimates the resistance that occurs under dynamic flow conditions characteristic of clinical situations.\r"

However, Pes and Pga do not contribute equally to Pdi under a number of clinical and physiologic conditions. We therefore tested the effect of varying the Pes and Pga contribution to Pdi on the EMG-DI using an esophageal electrode in 5 normal men during fatiguing contractions. Falls in the H/L occurred in all subjects regardless of the relative contribution of Pes and Pga to Pdi at a tension-time index of 0.29 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SE). However, the time constant of decay of the H/L varied widely among subjects when Pes predominated (173.9 +/- 45.7 s; coefficient of variation, 58.7%) or Pga predominated (78.4 +/- 19.4 s; coefficient of variation, 55.2%), whereas it was consistent among subjects when Pes and Pga were equal (72.3 +/- 3.8 s; coefficient of variation, 11.6%). In addition, a significant relationship was found between the mean integrated activity of the EMG-DI compared with maximum and the time constant of decay of the H/L (r = 0.57, p less than 0.03). We conclude that the differences in the rate of decay of the H/L was at least partly a result of differences in the relative activation of the crural diaphragm at the same Pdi.\r"

As a consequence, for a given decrease in pleural pressure (Ppl) during quiet inspiration (qi), abdominal pressure (Pab) should either undergo a smaller increase than normal or, in severe cases, decrease. If so, the ratio of change in Pab to Ppl during qi (delta Pab/delta Ppl(qi], which is normally less than -1 when upright, should increase, approaching +1 in profound diaphragmatic weakness. To examine the relationship between degree of diaphragmatic weakness and delta Pab/delta Ppl(qi), we measured (erect and supine) anteroposterior rib cage and abdominal motion, Pab, Ppl, and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during qi, maximal inspiration (Pdi(max)mi) and maximal inspiratory effort at FRC (Pdi(max)FRC) in 10 patients with bilateral and 8 with unilateral diaphragmatic weakness. Pdi(max)mi and Pdi(max)FRC were low in all patients. delta Pab/delta Ppl(qi) (erect) was increased in all patients (0.28 +/- 0.7; mean +/- SD) and correlated closely with both Pdi(max)mi (r = -0.89, p less than 0.001) and Pdi(max)FRC (r = -0.76, p less than 0.001). There was extensive overlap in the data between unilateral and bilateral diaphragmatic weakness. The ratio of delta Pdi during qi to Pdi(max)FRC was less than 0.31 in all patients. The results suggest that delta Pab/delta Ppl(qi) is a useful index of the degree of diaphragmatic weakness and that the functional consequences of unilateral and bilateral weakness are not rigidly separable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The responses of controls were lower in the females (-0.63 +/- 0.07 L/min/% SaO2) than the males (-1.11 +/- 0.18 L/min/% SaO2). Alcohol depressed the male response to a mean of -0.50 +/- 0.08 L/min/%SaO2 (p less than 0.01) but increased the mean female response to -0.87 +/- 0.11 L/min/%SaO2 (p less than 0.01). Naloxone reversed the ethanol-induced depression of the hypercapnic hypoxic response in males, but had no effect on the female response. In males there was a direct correlation between the magnitude of the initial hypoxic response and the extent of depression by ethanol; the higher the response the greater the depression. Females showed a significant direct correlation between the blood alcohol and the increase in hypercapnic hypoxic slope, whereas males showed a weaker inverse correlation to blood alcohol level. These results demonstrate that ethanol depresses male but not female hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness and suggest that this is mediated by opioid-like mechanisms. Because the alcohol-induced depression was seen in subjects with a high control hypoxic response, the male-female difference might simply reflect initially lower control responses in females. This suggests a qualitative difference in hypoxic ventilatory control mechanisms between sexes.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were performed to test the hypothesis that the evolution of a specific immune response in lung parenchyma upregulates the expression of Ia on surface membranes of murine alveolar macrophages. A secondary antibody-forming cell response to sheep erythrocytes was generated in lung parenchyma by intratracheal antigen challenge of systemically primed mice. During the immune response, alveolar macrophages were retrieved by bronchoalveolar lavage, and the percentages and total numbers of Ia-positive macrophages were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. The expression of Ia on surface membranes of lavaged alveolar macrophages increased in association with the generation of antibody-forming cell responses in lung tissue. This increase in Ia expression was antigen specific; intratracheal challenge with noncrossreacting antigen did not increase Ia expression. Nonspecific inflammation of the lung, induced by intratracheal hydrochloric acid, elicited increases in total numbers of macrophages that were similar in magnitude to those induced by specific immune responses, but increased Ia expression only modestly. In unprimed mice, intratracheal antigen challenge did not increase Ia expression by alveolar macrophages unless the mice had received immune splenocytes by adoptive transfer at the time of challenge. The results show that the generation of a specific immune response in pulmonary parenchyma upregulates the expression of Ia by murine alveolar macrophages in vivo and suggest that the accumulation of antigen-reactive lymphocytes in the lung plays an important role in this upregulation.\r"

Unconcentrated, cell-free lavage freshly obtained from normal volunteers clotted normal plasma in a mean of 84 +/- 20 s. The procoagulant activity was initiated by Factor VII-tissue factor complexes as judged by differential activity in various plasmas genetically deficient in single clotting factors, by neutralization of the procoagulant activity with antibodies to either Factor VII or tissue factor, and by a Factor X activation assay. Preincubation of the lavage with calcium was required to demonstrate Factor VII activity in unconcentrated samples. The cell-free fluid contained about 8,500 thromboplastin units/mg protein, equivalent to a third of the thromboplastin standard and indicating high amounts of cofactor. Quantitation of Factor VII was estimated by functional analysis in coagulation and amidolytic assays with reference to dilutions of normal plasma of known Factor VII concentration. When lavage and diluted plasma were adjusted to yield equivalent amidolytic activities, the average ratio of the Factor VII-clotting activity of the alveolar fluid relative to plasma Factor VII was 19 +/- 7, suggesting the presence of Factor VIIa in lavage. In contrast to previous reports with serum or activated plasma, immunoblots of concentrated lavage revealed only single-chain Factor VII, and 125I-Factor VII added to the fluid was not converted to 125I-Factor VIIa, suggesting a unique control mechanism in the lung compartment which differs from plasma. When equivalent Factor VII amidolytic activities in diluted plasma and cell-free lavage were compared, the rates of Factor Xa formation were very similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The protein was isolated on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose columns by a cross-reaction with the monoclonal antibody against pig low MW protein (15 kDa) used as a marker. Acidic ethanol-soluble proteins obtained from the fractions eluted by 0.09 to 0.16 M NaCl concentration from the CM-cellulose column migrated mainly as a 15-kDa band in the SDS-PAGE system without urea but mainly as a 5-kDa band in a system with 8 M urea. The isoelectric point of the protein was pH 10 to 11, and it contained a large proportion of hydrophobic amino acids (72%), especially leucine (17%). The arginine content was also high (9%). Two monoclonal antibodies were raised against this low MW protein, and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the antigen was located in the inclusions of alveolar wall cells in normal lungs and in lungs from a patient with alveolar proteinosis. These results indicate that the low MW protein originates from lamellar inclusions of alveolar wall cells (possibly type II epithelial cells) and is secreted into alveolar spaces.\r"

  ".W": "This study reveals that respiratory tract infections make the tracheal mucosa of rats more susceptible to neurogenic inflammation, which is a type of inflammation mediated by neuropeptides released from sensory nerves. Neurogenic inflammation was produced in the tracheas of 2 groups of Long-Evans rats by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (5 V, 1 ms, 20 Hz for 5 min) or by an injection of capsaicin (15 to 200 micrograms/kg i.v.) or substance P (0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/kg i.v.). Rats of one group were pathogen-free; the others had serologic evidence of naturally occurring airway infections caused by Sendai virus, coronavirus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. The stimuli produced neurogenic inflammation in both groups of rats, but the magnitude of this inflammation was much greater in the infected rats. The susceptibility of the infected rats to neurogenic inflammation was manifested by a 2.0 to 3.1 times larger increase in vascular permeability to Monastral blue, 5 times larger increase in number of neutrophils adhering to the endothelium of venules, and conspicuous morphologic changes in the tracheal epithelium. When pathogen-free rats acquired respiratory tract infections, they too became susceptible to neurogenic inflammation. Other experiments showed that infection by Sendai virus was essential for the change, although infection by M. pulmonis or coronavirus may also be necessary. The susceptibility to neurogenic inflammation outlasted the transient pathologic changes caused in the airway mucosa by the viral infections and may have been permanent.\r"

The purpose of this study was to identify the cells responsible for transfer and to determine if pulmonary cells can transfer HP. We cultured LNC from sensitized Strain 2 guinea pigs with a soluble extract of Micropolyspora faeni for 72 h, separated lymphoblasts from small lymphocytes, and transferred both subpopulations intravenously to syngeneic recipients. We also transferred irradiated lymphoblasts (1,500 rads), macrophage-depleted, lymphoblast-enriched populations, and pulmonary cells either without culture or after culture with M. faeni. Control animals received an equal volume of medium. All recipient animals were challenged intratracheally (i.t.) with M. faeni 48 h after the cell transfer, and they were killed 4 days after i.t. challenge. Randomly selected microscopic fields of the lung (250/animal) were judged to be normal or abnormal without knowledge of treatment. This measurement was reproducible (r = 0.95 for duplicate measurements, n = 55). All guinea pigs were maintained in HEPA-filtered air. There was a low level of pulmonary response to an i.t. challenge of M. faeni in animals that received medium. Animals that received pulmonary cells, either cultured or noncultured, did not differ from those in the control group. There was a substantial increase (p less than 0.01) in the extent of pulmonary abnormalities in the recipients of the lymphoblast population, with significant correlation (r = 0.87, p less than 0.01) between the number of lymphoblasts transferred and the extent of pulmonary abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The chest radiographs (CXR) were obtained with a high kilovoltage phototimed technique. The CT scans were obtained with a GE 9800 machine and the MRI studies with a 0.3 Tesla permanent magnet imaging system. The primary tumor was well demonstrated by all 3 imaging techniques; however, the configuration of lesions was best demonstrated by CT. MRI was superior to CXR and CT for demonstrating hilar involvement in 4 cases. CT and MRI were generally comparable for demonstrating mediastinal involvement but were superior to CXR. In 2 cases, small normal size nodes seen on CT were considered to be a single large abnormal node on MRI. Because of the paucity of signal from flowing blood, compression and displacement of vessels were easier to identify with MRI. In 1 case, a small pleural effusion was better seen with CT than with CXR or with MRI. Direct chest wall involvement in 1 case was not seen by CXR. Vertebral body abnormality in another case was seen only by MRI and not by CXR or CT. At present, MRI, with its long scanning time, motion degradation of the image, and poor spatial resolution, is inferior to CT for imaging lung cancer. For evaluation of intrathoracic extent of lung cancer, CT remains the procedure of choice after performing plain chest radiography.\r"

A diagnosis of asthma induced by toluene diisocyanate (TDI) had been established 6 yr before, when he underwent inhalation challenges with carbachol and with TDI. The subject had airway hyperresponsiveness to carbachol (PD20FEV1 carbachol = 0.32 mg; normal value greater than 1.0 mg) and developed an early and long-lasting asthmatic reaction after exposure to TDI in the laboratory. Although it was recommended that he change his job or stop using paints containing isocyanates, he continued to work as a car painter, taking antiasthmatic drugs both at work and at home to control asthma symptoms. On Monday, October 6, 1986, at 11:30 A. M., he developed a severe attack of asthma while he was mixing the 2 components of a polyurethane paint. Taken to hospital, he was dead on arrival. Autopsy showed no evidence of cardiac or brain disease; lungs were overinflated, the cut surface showed grey glistening mucous plugs in in the airways. Histologic examination showed denudation of airway epithelium and thickening of the basement membrane with infiltration of the lamina propria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mainly eosinophils, and diffuse mucous plugging of bronchioles. Bronchial smooth muscle appeared hyperplastic and disarrayed, and lung parenchyma showed focal areas of alveolar destruction adjacent to areas of perfectly intact alveolar walls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bracing the arms increased ventilatory capacity significantly in all subjects, but the magnitude of the change was small (8%). We attribute the change to improved function of the accessory muscles that expand the rib cage. We speculate that this effect assumes greater importance in patients with COPD, whose diaphragms are flattened and ineffective, because such patients depend more on the inspiratory muscles of the rib cage.\r"

Results obtained with TPC-MC were compared with those obtained with TPC using a conventional fiberoptic bronchoscope (FB) in random order. The diagnosis of BPN was definitely confirmed in 18 patients. In 7 patients, all TPC samples (MC and FB) were sterile, and a diagnosis other than BPN was proved. In the former group, colony-forming units equal to or greater than 10(3)/ml of one or more microorganisms were obtained in 61% of TPC-MC and in 66% of TPC-FB samples. These percentages increased to 64 and 71%, respectively, when 4 patients with previous antibiotic treatment were excluded from the study group. Agreement was observed between microorganisms cultured from both TPC samples in 11 of 18 patients with proved BPN (61%). Complete disparity was seen only in 2 patients (11%). Two patients developed a self-limiting hemoptysis after the TPC procedure (MC and FB, respectively). We conclude that TPC-MC is both a sensitive and specific technique for the diagnosis of BPN in mechanically ventilated patients. Because the diagnostic value of TPC-MC is similar to that of TPC-FB, we propose that the MC be used in patients receiving mechanical ventilation when the FB is not available. The simplicity and lower cost of this new system are important advantages to be considered over the fiberoptic bronchoscope.\r"

To investigate this problem, we administered saline alone, 10 mg iron oxide (an inert dust), or 10 or 30 mg of quartz to rats by intratracheal instillation. Animals were killed after 30 days, and pulmonary function and morphologic changes were examined. The iron oxide group was similar to the saline control group in all functional and morphometric parameters. However, both quartz-exposed groups showed evidence of air-flow obstruction, with more severe abnormalities in the high dose group. These findings correlated with morphometric observations of emphysema and thickened airway walls, with changes again more severe in the high dose group. Early silicotic nodules were also present in the latter animals. We conclude that in addition to the classic lesions of nodular silicosis, quartz can produce morphologic and functional changes of air-flow obstruction; no such changes are seen with iron oxide. These observations may explain the air-flow obstruction seen in workers exposed to mineral dusts.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we treated adjacent slices of resected lung lobes with either theophylline or carbachol and determined the dimensions of the airways in these lung slices. Transverse sections of contracted (n = 58) and relaxed (n = 55) airways were used to measure the Pi defined by the epithelial surface, lumen area (Ai), external perimeter (Pe) defined by the outer edge of the smooth muscle layer, and the external area (Ae). Wall area (WA = Ae - Ai) was calculated. The frequency distribution of internal perimeters was not significantly different for the contracted and relaxed airways, and when the square root of wall area was plotted against Pi, the regression lines for the contracted and relaxed airways were almost identical. The \"relaxed\" external perimeter was calculated Per = square root Pi2 + (4 pi WA), and the percentage of muscle shortening (PMS) was determined: PMS = [(Per - Pe)/Per] x 100. We conclude that Pi and WA are constant in airways whether the smooth muscle is relaxed or contracted and that Pi can be used as a marker of airway size and, under controlled conditions, can be used to calculate the smooth muscle shortening present in a given airway.\r"

Increases in total pulmonary resistance caused by acetylcholine aerosol were measured to assess bronchial responsiveness in these 3 groups. In parallel studies, neutrophil influx into the tracheal mucosa was quantified by counting cells within whole mounts of tracheas that were treated histochemically to stain the myeloperoxidase in neutrophils, and tracheal vascular permeability was quantified by measuring the amount of Evans blue dye extravasated into the trachea. In the rats studied immediately after the ozone exposure, the concentration of acetylcholine required to increase total pulmonary resistance to three-fold the baseline value was only 6% of that required in the controls. In the rats studied 24 h after the ozone exposure, this provocative acetylcholine concentration was not significantly different from that of the controls. Neither the number of neutrophils in the tracheal mucosa nor the amount of Evans blue dye extravasated into the trachea was significantly different from the corresponding control values at either time. We conclude that rats exposed to ozone develop bronchial hyperresponsiveness without detectable neutrophil influx or increased vascular permeability in the trachea.\r"

ED1 fibronectin, measured by quantitative immunoassay, was markedly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (2 and 4 h posttreatment) from rabbits with lung injury resulting from intrabronchial treatment with glucose oxidase and glucose to generate H2O2. This protein comprised a greater portion of total fibronectin in BAL fluid than in plasma, suggesting local release. Leukocyte-mediated lung injury after intrabronchial or intravenous treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) also affected ED1 fibronectin, triggering specific accumulation of this fibronectin variant in both BAL fluid and plasma. ED1 fibronectin in tissue fluids was largely intact and dimeric during injury, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Compartmental release of soluble ED1 fibronectin reflects acute pulmonary injury induced by oxidants or leukocytes in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Three methods for volume partitioning were simultaneously used to study 8 preterm infants: (1) miniature magnetometers, which measured the anteroposterior diameter of the chest wall and abdomen, (2) mercury-in-rubber strain gauges, which measured circumference changes, and (3) an inductance plethysmograph (Respitrace), which reportedly measures volume changes of a coil of fine wire placed around the chest and abdomen. Volume changes of the chest wall and abdomen were calibrated against lung volume changes measured with a pneumotachograph using a multiple linear regression (MLR) method, and the partitioning was checked by airway occlusion. The abdominal signals of the 3 systems were similar. The chest wall signals from the strain gauges and inductance plethysmograph were also similar but differed from those of the magnetometers (in 2 of the infants) primarily due to differences in the phase relationship of the signals. The 95% confidence limits for estimates of changes in lung volume by the MLR method in most infants was +/- 5% using all 3 systems. The airway occlusion check, however, could not corroborate the accuracy of volume partitioning by the magnetometers in half the infants. The minute volume displacement of the diaphragm was the same for the strain gauges and the inductance plethysmograph, ranging from 48 to 127% of the pulmonary minute ventilation, and was significantly underestimated by the magnetometers (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that distortion of the sternal portion of the chest wall, as detected by the magnetometers, represents less volumetric loss than the volume lost for the entire chest wall due to paradoxical breathing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PGF2 alpha (1 mg/ml inhaled for 5 min) was administered to induce bronchoconstriction. Then aerosolized capsaicin was inhaled (2.4 x 10(-9) mol) to stimulate bronchial C-fibers. PGF2 alpha produced significant bronchoconstriction; FEV1 and flow during a PEFV curve at 30% forced vital capacity (V30p) decreased over a 15-min period. Capsaicin induced significant bronchodilation; V30p increased for 2 to 6 min (0.001 less than p less than 0.02), and FEV1 increased for 2 to 4 min (p less than 0.05) when compared with saline-ethanol (vehicle of capsaicin) inhalation. After treatment with the ganglionic blocking agent hexamethonium, the significant bronchodilator response disappeared. These results suggest that the NAI system has a distinct bronchodilator action in human subjects in vivo, and that the bronchial C-fiber receptors may be involved in the reflex pathway for NAI system bronchodilation in humans.\r"

Because both hypoosmolarity and acidity can cause bronchoconstriction, we studied whether there was a positive interaction between these stimuli in 12 subjects with asthma. We administered the following aerosols: hypoosmolar saline (30 mOsm) at pH 5.5, 3 hypoosmolar acids (0.005 M H2SO4, 0.01 M HNO3 and a 1:1 mixture of 0.005 M H2SO4 and 0.01 M HNO3, all 30 mOsm) at pH 2, and isoosmolar 0.005 M H2SO4 (300 mOsm) at pH 2. Each aerosol was administered on a separate day and was inhaled through a mouthpiece during tidal breathing. Specific airway resistance (SRaw) was measured before and after the subjects inhaled aerosols delivered at as much as 5 doubling nebulizer outputs. For each aerosol challenge, an output-response curve was generated, and the nebulizer output required to increase SRaw by 100% above baseline (PO100) was calculated. Mean values of PO100 were significantly lower for each of the hypoosmolar acids than for hypoosmolar saline (1.65 + 0.43 g/min [mean + SEM] for saline compared with 0.95 + 0.11, 1.05 + 0.20, and 0.90 + 0.14 for H2SO4, HNO3, and a 1:1 mixture of the two; all p values less than 0.025). Mean values of PO100 did not differ among the 3 acids studied. For 7 of 12 subjects, all 3 acids caused a leftward shift in the output-response curve from the curve generated for hypoosmolar saline aerosol. Isoosmolar H2SO4 did not increase SRaw by 100% in any subjects, even at the maximal nebulizer output that delivered a concentration of H2SO4 in excess of 40 mg/m3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Felodipine is a new calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group with a high selectivity for arteriolar smooth muscle; it is under clinical investigation for the treatment of hypertension. In this double-blind, randomized crossover trial in 9 patients, the effect of 10 mg felodipine in oral solution on exercise-induced asthma was compared with a placebo on separate days. The FEV1 was at least 80% of the predicted normal value, with variation between study days of less than 10%. Heart rate, blood pressure, and FEV1 were measured before and at 15 and 30 min after each treatment. The exercise test consisted of steady state running at submaximal work loads for 6 to 8 min and started at 30 min after treatments. FEV1 was measured at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after the end of exercise. The predrug baseline FEV1 values were comparable on the 2 days of the study, and felodipine had no effect on the resting lung function. The mean percentage fall in FEV1 (SEM) after exercise with placebo was 27.0 (4.5)%, and with felodipine it was 13.5 (3.7)%. The difference between felodipine and placebo was statistically significant. While receiving felodipine, the resting heart rate was increased by 15%, with a tendency to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The heart rate after exercise was higher during felodipine treatment than during placebo treatment. One patient receiving placebo and 7 receiving felodipine noted a transient headache. Two patients receiving felodipine also noticed lightheadedness after exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of the antiasthmatic inhaled steroid budesonide at low and high dosage (0.6 and 2.4 mg/day) on calcium and phosphate metabolism (Ca, P) in 10 normal adults. Their endogenous production of cortisol dropped with budesonide treatment (p less than or equal to 0.0005), as did androgen production (p less than or equal to 0.003). This was associated with an increase in the renal tubular maximal reabsorption of Ca (p = 0.003) and P (p = 0.03), a decrease in the urinary output of Ca in the fasting morning state (p = 0.03), and an increase in serum P (p = 0.02). However, there was no change in the 24-h urinary excretion of Ca (p = 0.76) or P (p = 0.08) or the serum Ca level (p = 0.19). Similarly, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and urinary cAMP levels were not affected, indicating that absorption of Ca from the gut was not compromised. Thus, in contrast to the expected effects of oral steroid treatment, inhaled budesonide had no discernible short-term adverse effect on Ca or P metabolism under the conditions of this study, despite purposely using a dosage high enough to partially inhibit adrenocortical function. These data tend to support a broadening of the therapeutic role of budesonide, and possibly other inhaled steroid drugs, to include higher doses and more severe asthmatics. However, additional clinical and metabolic studies are needed to fully clarify the effects of high-dose inhaled steroid therapy on bone.\r"

All patients already hospitalized in or newly admitted to the medical and surgical intensive care units at San Francisco General Hospital between September 1, 1983 and August 29, 1986 were eligible for admission to the study if they had either (1) an increase in temperature of 1.5 degrees C and a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more from baseline values (in already hospitalized patients), or (2) a temperature greater than 38.5 degrees C or less than 35.5 degrees C and a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg (in newly admitted patients). Patients meeting these criteria were excluded if they (1) had severe immunodeficiency, (2) were less than 18 or greater than 76 yr of age, (3) had multilobar roentgenographic infiltrates, or (4) were already receiving corticosteroids. Eighty-seven patients enrolled in the study received either methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg per dose, or mannitol placebo for a total of 4 doses every 6 h, following the presumptive diagnosis of septic shock. Of these patients, 75 ultimately were determined on the basis of culture results to have actually had septic shock at the time of entry. Thirteen of the patients who received methylprednisolone developed ARDS, compared to 14 patients who received placebo.

We evaluated this relationship in 11 patients with pulmonary hypertension, 8 with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), and 3 with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive lung disease (SPH) at baseline and during treatment with vasodilating calcium channel antagonists. The mean baseline DO2 and VO2 were 11.0 +/- 4.2 and 3.9 +/- 1.1 ml/min/kg, respectively. After increasing cardiac output via vasodilators, we obtained an average of 3 additional data points per patient. We found a significant relationship between changes in VO2 and changes in DO2 (delta VO2 = -0.19 +/- 0.27 x delta DO2; r = 0.88, n = 37). In 4 patients, VO2 was determined both by respired gas analysis and by calculation from thermodilution cardiac output and measured arteriovenous oxygen gradient; results by the 2 methods were virtually identical. There was no significant relationship between cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen content or mixed venous oxygen tension (r = 0.20 and 0.47, respectively). Mean baseline oxygen extraction ratio was 36.7 +/- 6.4% and did not increase significantly after vasodilator therapy. We conclude that in patients with pulmonary hypertension, changes in oxygen consumption appear to be dependent on changes in oxygen delivery. This may represent evidence of tissue hypoxemia, which is otherwise not apparent. This dependency may support the use of vasodilators in these patients.\r"

Two National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified \"B\" readers interpreted the radiographs. The predominant radiographic abnormalities noted were scanty, small, irregular opacities in the lower zones of profusion 0/1 to 1/1. Rounded opacities were rare. Among nonsmokers with low dust exposures, the prevalence of opacities greater than or equal to 1/0 showed no trend with increasing age and duration of exposure, suggesting no relationship between age and prevalence of opacities of Category 1 or more in this cohort (p greater than 0.10). Nonsmokers who had accumulated higher dust exposures showed a trend of increasing prevalence of opacities with increasing duration, suggesting an effect of occupational exposure at higher cumulative exposure levels (p less than 0.05). In most exposure categories, smokers exceeded nonsmokers in their prevalence of opacities greater than or equal to 1/0; the overall prevalence among smokers being 12 and 11% according to Readers A and B, respectively, compared with 4% in nonsmokers (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, 7 to 8% of aluminum workers in this cohort had radiographic findings of scanty, small, irregular opacities, the prevalence of which was increased among smokers (p less than 0.01). There was a moderate increase in the prevalence of opacities with increasing tenure in nonsmokers with high cumulative exposures (p less than 0.05).\r"

A questionnaire on respiratory disease and maternal and paternal smoking habits was administered to one parent. Skin prick tests using the most common allergens present in central Italy, a flow-volume spirometric test, and a bronchial provocation test using carbachol in increasing doses were performed. Male children with smoking parents had significantly increased BR when compared to those whose parents did not smoke (Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.3, p = 0.009). No such significant increase in BR was found in female children of smoking parents (OR = 1.5, p = 0.4). The relationship between BR in children and smoking in parents was stronger in asthmatics (p = 0.02), but was still significant after controlling for asthma and atopy. Bronchial responsiveness was significantly correlated with atopy (p = 0.001). This was also true for nonasthmatic children and for both males and females separately. Male children of smoking parents had increased reactivity to allergens as assessed by the skin prick test index (p = 0.001). It is hypothesized that passive smoking, by increasing the frequency of BR and of atopy, may increase the risk of asthma in childhood and particularly in boys.\r"

The methodology used was the same in both studies: parent-completed questionnaire and BHR measured by response to an abbreviated histamine challenge. In Auckland, 1,084 children participated (84% of those selected) and were compared to 769 inland NSW and 718 coastal NSW children. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms, BHR, severity of BHR, and BHR combined with symptoms was similar among Auckland and inland NSW children but lower among coastal NSW children than those from the other two sites.

In September 1984 and March 1985, the provocative dose of histamine producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was measured, and respiratory symptoms and medication use assessed by questionnaire in 78 subjects taking part in a study of seasonal changes in airway reactivity. On both occasions, PD20 was negatively correlated with current frequency of wheezing, with the amount of asthma medication in regular use, and with the current general assessment of breathing problems. In the 45 subjects who had a PD20 value of 8 mumol or less on at least one of the two occasions tested, PD20 increased between September and March by 0.46 (SEM, 0.32) doubling doses of histamine (p = 0.16). Within subjects, change in PD20 was negatively correlated with change in the frequency of wheezing in the past month (p less than 0.005) and with change in medication use (p less than 0.05). This study demonstrates that PD20 is related to the severity of respiratory symptoms and medication use, and that change in airway reactivity within subjects in a community population is associated with changes in the frequency of wheezing and in the use of asthma medication.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the clinical features and outcome of patients with hypercapnia from acute asthma, we examined 229 (62 men, 167 women) consecutive episodes of acute asthma over a 6-yr period. Sixty-one episodes were associated with hypercapnia at presentation (PaCO2 greater than 38 mm Hg). Men more commonly presented with hypercapnia: 31 of 62 (50%) men with acute asthma had hypercapnia compared with only 30 of 167 (18%) women (p less than 0.001). Patients with hypercapnia had a longer duration of chronic asthma and were more likely to be steroid-dependent. Hypercapnic patients had greater airway obstruction, respiratory rate, and pulsus paradoxus than did nonhypercapnic patients. Findings of a quiet chest on auscultation, inability to talk, and cyanosis also suggested the presence of hypercapnia. Five hypercapnic patients required mechanical ventilation, but hypercapnia did not prolong hospitalization. In nonventilated patients, hypercapnia resolved in a mean time of 5.9 h; 50% of hypercapnic episodes resolved by 4 h, and all resolved by 16 h. No patient presenting with normocapnia progressed to hypercapnia with therapy, and there were no deaths in either the hypercapnic group or the nonhypercapnic group. In patients with more than one admission, the PaCO2 of one episode correlated with the PaCO2 on a subsequent admission, suggesting a role for individual variation in ventilatory control. With appropriate medical therapy, most patients with hypercapnia from acute asthma have rapid reversibility, and mechanical ventilation usually can be avoided. However, these patients require close inhospital observation until it is certain that the acute asthmatic episode has resolved.\r"

Seven subjects were asked to hyperventilate mixtures of 80% helium/20% oxygen (HeO2) or 80% sulfur hexafluoride/20% oxygen (SF6O2) for 5 min at a fixed target minute ventilation of 20 x FEV1 and an inspired gas temperature of 0 degrees C. Each subject equilibrated his or her lungs with the appropriate gas mixture prior to testing: PETCO2 and FIO2 were monitored and maintained at constant values (CO2 = 0.05; O2 = 0.20) by CO2 scrubbing and addition of compressed gas to the system. Gas composition, inspired and expired flow rates, and gas temperatures at the airway opening were recorded in real time using a computer-based data collection system that calculated respiratory heat loss on a per breath basis. Bronchoconstriction was quantitated using specific airway conductance measured before and serially after each challenge. The degree of bronchoconstriction correlated closely with evaporative respiratory heat loss (r = 0.658 p less than 0.05), but poorly with both temperature-gradient (r = 0.114, p greater than 0.20) and total (r = 0.268, p greater than 0.15) heat loss. These findings suggest that total respiratory heat loss is not the primary stimulus in exercise-induced asthma, and further suggest that total water loss, or focal heat/water loss, may be important in inducing bronchospasm in this subset of asthmatics.\r"

In lung interstitial tissues and alveoli, AFC mature into plasma cells and produce specific antibody. In addition to AFC, published data suggest that memory cells are also recruited to and/or are produced in immunized lung lobes, and that these memory cells can respond in the alveoli to secondary antigen challenges. The purpose of this study was to determine if memory cells induced in the lung by multiple antigen exposures could respond in vivo to challenges with low doses of antigen. The degree of inflammation produced by antigen doses that would allow the accumulation of AFC from the blood was evaluated. Beagle dogs were anesthetized, and a fiberoptic bronchoscope used to instill 10(6), 10(7), 10(8), 10(9), or 10(10) sheep red blood cells (SRBC) into individual lung lobes. Of these doses, only 10(9) and 10(10) SRBC significantly increased inflammation (increased number of neutrophils) or vascular permeability (increased total protein). The number of specific IgM AFC and concentration of anti-SRBC IgG antibody were significantly elevated only in lavage fluid from the lung lobes immunized with 10(9) and 10(10) SRBC. Four lung lobes were then given two additional challenges with 10(10) SRBC. In third and fourth challenges, these lung lobes received doses of SRBC of 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) SRBC. The results showed that significantly increased numbers of specific IgM AFC and concentrations of IgG antibody were found even at the lowest dose of antigen (10(4) SRBC) in the absence of increased inflammation or vascular permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NK cell assays demonstrated that ASGM1 was effective in reduction of NK cell activity in bg/+ mice to levels comparable to bg/bg mice. To test for possible cross reaction with other immune cells and ASGM1, we evaluated lymphocyte and macrophage function. These studies included lymphocyte transformation, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), and macrophage candidacidal activity. We found no evidence of any effects from ASGM1. Mice were evaluated for survival and colony counts after intravenous (i.v.) H. capsulatum challenge. We again confirmed increased susceptibility of bg/bg mice to H. capsulatum, but found no significant differences between bg/+ mice and bg/+ mice treated with ASGM1. Therefore, we conclude that NK cells play no major role in nonspecific early host defenses against H. capsulatum.\r"

Curves were recorded in each infant over a range of compression pressures as high as and exceeding the pressure required for the maximal partial FEFV curve. The maximal curves were quantitated and compared with passive compliance and conductance of the respiratory system and absolute lung volume measured by whole-body plethysmography. In some infants, the transmission of pressure between cuff and pleural space was determined. Partial FEFV curve shapes generated with a standardized compression pressure calculated from the transmission of pressure data to give an increase in pleural pressure at FRC of 10 cm H2O were compared between infants. For these standardized compressions, infants with convex curves tended to have better respiratory function than did those with concave curves. The combination of a concave curve and flow limitation during tidal expiration was associated with the worst function. Two parameters, the ratio of forced maximal expiratory flow (measured from the maximal partial FEFV curve) to tidal expiratory flow (measured from the expiratory flow-volume curve of tidal breathing) at midtidal volume (Vm1d(forced/tidal] and the minimal compression pressure required to generate maximal expiratory flow at FRC (Pmin), satisfactorily quantified respiratory function without the need for size correction with absolute lung volume. In addition, Vm1d(forced/tidal) provides an index of expiratory flow reserve. We conclude that useful information can be provided from the shape of a partial FEFV curve in an infant, provided that curves are generated by a standardized compression pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was also measured during both maneuvers to compare maximal diaphragmatic strength. Sniff Pes (males, 68 +/- 27 cm H2O; normal greater than 53; females, 66 +/- 21; normal greater than 48) was greater than Pimax (males, 45 +/- 24 cm H2O; normal greater than 42; females, 42 +/- 24; normal greater than 17) in 55 of the 61 patients, both in absolute values and as a percentage of normal. In 36 patients Pimax and sniff Pes were both normal (mean +/- 2 SD), whereas in 13 patients they were both low. In 11 patients, Pimax was low, but sniff Pes was normal. One patient had a reduced sniff Pes but a Pimax at the lower limit of normal. In the 36 patients in whom both Pimax and sniff Pes were normal, Pdi was also normal or only moderately reduced, and in the 13 patients in whom both Pimax and sniff Pes were reduced, Pdi was very low. However, in the group of 11 patients with a low Pimax but a normal sniff Pes, Pdi was normal or only moderately reduced, suggesting that Pimax was falsely low, perhaps because of difficulties with the technique. Conversely, in the single patient with a low sniff Pes but a Pimax just within the normal range, Pdi was very low. We conclude that measurement of esophageal pressure during a maximal sniff is a useful test of inspiratory muscle strength and overcomes the difficulty some patients have in carrying out the Pimax maneuver.\r"

Likewise, in the presence of fatigue, function should improve when blood flow is increased. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of increasing blood flow to the fatigued diaphragm. Studies were performed on anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs in which strips of costal diaphragm were developed in situ. Strip tension was measured with an isometric tension transducer. The inferior phrenic artery supplying the strip was cannulated and pump perfused at a pressure of 92 +/- 3 mm Hg; phrenic artery flow and pressure were continuously monitored with in-line doppler flow probes and pressure transducers, respectively. Fatigue was produced by electrically stimulating strips to contract 15 times/min (initial tension 80% of maximum, duty cycle 50%). Rhythmic contraction resulted in a downward shift in the diaphragm force-frequency relationship in all strips. In eight strips, stepwise increments in phrenic artery perfusion pressure to 161 +/- 8 and 281 +/- 17 mm Hg were produced by increasing pump speed at 6 and 8 min into rhythmic stimulation; in four strips, phrenic artery perfusion pressure was increased to 152 +/- 20 and 257 +/- 32 mm Hg at 20 and 25 min into rhythmic stimulation, respectively. Each increase in phrenic artery pressure resulted in increases in phrenic artery flow and diaphragm tension and produced an upshift in the diaphragm force-frequency relationship.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is particularly important during sleep, when upper airway resistance is greater. We measured ventilatory, genioglossal (EMGgg) and diaphragmatic (EMGdi) electromyogram responses to isocapnic hypoxia during wakefulness (W), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in seven chronically instrumented adult goats. We also compared the EMG responses to hypoxia to response to CO2 during W. delta EMGdi/delta SaO2 decreased progressively from W to SWS (p less than 0.05) to REM sleep (p less than 0.05 versus SWS), paralleling the corresponding ventilatory responses. EMGgg was activated only below an SaO2 threshold, similar during W (69.8 +/- 6.3%) and SWS (67.2 +/- 4.3%), beyond which there was a brisk linear increase. During REM sleep, arousal preceded activation of EMGgg in each animal, although SaO2 at arousal (61.3 +/- 4.4%) was less than the SaO2 threshold for EMGgg activation during W or SWS (p less than 0.05). Despite state-related differences in the individual muscle responses, simultaneous EMGgg and EMGdi during hypoxia or hypercapnia in W, and during hypoxia in SWS and REM sleep, were linked in a constant manner. This suggests common integration of central and peripheral chemoreceptor inputs. Furthermore, these relationships are unaffected by either SWS or REM sleep.\r"

After baseline evaluation, on two separate days all selected patients had spirometry and a self-paced 12-min treadmill walking test performed (in double-blind crossover fashion) before and after random administration of five puffs of inhaled metaproterenol or placebo. A few weeks later, testing was repeated single-blind before and after inhaled metaproterenol, but this time the 12-min walk was done in an enclosed hall. Pretreatment spirometry values were similar on all study days, and none of the subjects had a significant change (greater than 15% from baseline) in FEV1 or FVC after the administration of placebo or metaproterenol. The postmetaproterenol treadmill and hall walking distances improved by a mean (+/- SD) of 112 +/- 56 m (p less than 0.001) and 82 +/- 46 m (p less than 0.01), respectively. Individual improvements in exercise performance did not correlate with the corresponding changes in FEV1 or FVC, or with the baseline DLCO measurement. We conclude that an objective improvement in physical performance after administration of a relatively high dose of inhaled metaproterenol can be seen in some patients with moderate to severe \"fixed\" airway obstruction, despite a lack of significant response as judged by conventional spirometry criteria.\r"

The model consisted of 12 anesthetized dogs (17 to 32 kg) that were partially paralyzed using intermittent low doses of muscle relaxant; this produced a steady-state mean PaCO2 of 90 +/- 15.8 mm Hg (+/- SD). A catheter (1.5 mm ID) was inserted into each lung to the most distal position possible and withdrawn 1 to 2 cm. The effects of a constant insufflation of oxygen at rates of 5, 10, or 20 L/min were studied at this position (mean distance from the carina = 9 +/- 2 cm); at the carina; and using a single catheter located 2 cm above the carina. The changes in PaCO2 and minute ventilation (VE) due to the insufflation were calculated from the mean steady-state control values. Using the data for all catheter positions and flow rates, the insufflation was associated with a mean decrease in PaCO2 of 31 (+/- 7.6) mm Hg associated with a mean decrease in VE of 48 (+/- 12.9)%. The flow of 20 L/min caused a significantly greater drop in PaCO2 than the flow of 5 L/min (p = 0.02). This technique may prove beneficial for patients with various forms of ventilatory failure that are difficult to treat by conventional means.\r"

To evaluate the relative capacity of human tissue macrophages to produce this mediator, alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes from the same normal individuals were activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated for TNF release and TNF mRNA transcript levels. Resting alveolar macrophages did not express TNF mRNA transcripts or release TNF. However, when activated, alveolar macrophages expressed TNF transcripts and synthesized and released TNF as evidenced by the presence of a 28 kDa mediator in LPS-activated alveolar macrophage supernatants that had cytotoxic activity for L-929 cells that was abrogated by anti-TNF antibodies and that coeluted with a pure TNF standard on a molecular sieve column. Interestingly, activated alveolar macrophages released severalfold more TNF than did autologous blood monocytes stimulated in a similar fashion and, in parallel, the alveolar macrophages expressed more TNF mRNA transcripts than activated blood monocytes. Thus, the ability to express the TNF gene and to release TNF apparently increases during maturation of blood monocytes into alveolar macrophages, suggesting that the release of TNF in the local milieu by activated tissue macrophages may be much more significant than the release of this mediator by circulating blood monocytes.\r"

Freeze-fracture replicas of ferret tracheal epithelium from 0 to 28 days of age exhibited progressive developmental patterns in tight junctional structure from beaded, unclosed patterns in newborns to more closed patterns at 28 days. Strand number increased while the depth of tight junctional structures and the proportion of strands exhibiting discontinuity decreased postnatally. Total transepithelial conductance, paracellular conductance, and cell size decreased over the first month. Our data suggest that changes in physiological parameters that reflect epithelial tight junction permeability can be attributed, at least in part, to maturation of this intercellular junction during the postnatal period.\r"

The devices were tested when they were dry and when they were humidified with 100% saturated water vapor for 8, 16, and 24 h. The amount of water added to the devices was measured. The pressure flow characteristics of the devices could be described by a power function: P = aVb, where P is pressure, V is flow, and a and b are constants determined by the characteristics of the devices.

  ".W": "Major basic protein (MBP), one of several cationic proteins associated with the eosinophil granule, is cytotoxic to respiratory epithelium and is present in the sputum of asthmatics and on damaged bronchial epithelium from patients dying of asthma. The present experiments were performed in order to determine the effects of MBP on the responsiveness of airway smooth muscle. Rings of guinea pig trachea, in some of which the epithelium had been gently removed by rubbing, were incubated for 5 h in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution containing buffer or human MBP (100 micrograms/ml). The tracheal rings were then suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with Krebs-Ringer solution containing indomethacin. MBP did not affect the reactivity of rings in which the epithelium had been removed, but significantly augmented that of unrubbed rings to acetylcholine and histamine. The results suggest that MBP, by inhibiting the function of epithelial but not smooth muscle cells, causes hyperreactivity of respiratory smooth muscle, which may contribute to the hyperreactivity observed in chronic respiratory disease.\r"

We compared the effects of two months of IMT with a pressure threshold breathing device at inspiratory pressure loads equal to either 15 or 30% of each patient's maximal inspiratory pressure (Plmax). This study was double blind and patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups, 12 in the 15% group and ten in the 30% group. Dependent variables were measured at baseline, and after one and two months of IMT. Patients who exercised with the 30% load improved the following: Plmax by a mean of -12 +/- 9 cm H2O (p less than 0.01), endurance time while breathing against an inspiratory pressure load equal to 66% of Plmax by 5 +/- 9 min (p less than 0.01), and 12-min distance walk (12MD) by 199 +/- 90 feet (p less than 0.01). Patients who exercised with the 15% load demonstrated no improvements in Plmax, endurance time, and 12MD. There were no changes in patients' report of functional impairment (Sickness Impact Profile), mood (Profile of Mood States), health status (Health Perceptions Questionnaire), and pulmonary symptoms (respiratory symptom log). We conclude that the 30% load was more effective than the 15% load in this sample.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has proved to be a rapid, safe, and sensitive method for the diagnosis of several forms of pneumonia in these patients, but its efficacy for confirming CMV pneumonia remains to be established. In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of conventional viral culture, immunocytochemical staining, and cytological examination performed on cells recovered by BAL for establishing CMV as the cause of pneumonia in 71 BAL specimens from 56 immunocompromised patients. Pneumonia due to CMV was confirmed by stated criteria in 14 of these patients. Virus was isolated by culture in BAL specimens from all patients with CMV pneumonia (sensitivity 100%), but also in 17 specimens from patients who did not have CMV pneumonia (specificity 70%). On cytologic examination, CMV inclusions were found in 3 of the 14 specimens from patients with CMV pneumonia (sensitivity 21%) and also in 1 patient at risk for pneumonia but who did not fulfill the criteria (specificity 98%). Thus, a positive culture and positive cytology virtually confirmed CMV pneumonia, whereas a negative culture excluded it. Immunocytochemistry proved to be particularly useful when the culture was positive and cytology was negative. In this situation, specific labeling of CMV antigen by monoclonal antibody was found in 9 of the 11 patients with CMV pneumonia (sensitivity 82%). Thus, the absence of specific staining in BAL cells tended to exclude CMV as a cause of pneumonia in patients with positive cultures and negative cytologies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The rates of growth and growth fractions were studied in cultures from different origins. As much as 85 +/- 5% (SE) of HDPFC cultured from specimens with early fibrosis were cycling when the cells were grown in basal media supplemented with 10% serum or growth factors. In contrast, 55% +/- 8% (SE) of HDPFC from normal lung and only 31% +/- 5% (SE) of HDPFC cultured from specimens with dense fibrosis were cycling in those culture conditions. Results obtained by removal of any of the five growth factors from the defined medium indicated that the altered growth patterns were not related to any single growth factor tested. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that HDPFC cultured from specimens with early fibrosis have a greater proliferative potential than HDPFC from late fibrosis.\r"

The present studies were undertaken to determine if alterations observed in alveolar epithelial cell morphology and cytoskeletal composition are reflected in the profile of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lipids recovered from injured lung. BAL protein and lipid analyses were performed on fluids recovered from control rats and from rats 7, 14, and 28 days after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, an antineoplastic agent well-known to cause pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. There were increases in recovery of total protein, nonpolar lipid, polar lipid, and phospholipid following bleomycin treatment. The recovery of saturated phosphatidylcholine was increased, but recovery of a second surfactant phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol, was unchanged, resulting in a significant change in their ratio. The recoveries of cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and triglyceride also were elevated. Changes in the proportional recoveries of neutral lipids, such as cholesterol and saturated phospholipids, could partly explain concurrent reductions in lung compliance that have been described. Changes in lavage lipids paralleled both the process of alveolar reepithelialization and altered expression of alveolar epithelial cell cytoskeletal proteins. Changes in lipid metabolism by alveolar epithelial cells following bleomycin-induced lung injury may be responsible for altered lavage lipid recovery and may directly be related to processes that take place during alveolar type II cell hyperplasia followed by transition to type I cells. BAL lipid analyses thus may provide a relatively noninvasive way of assessing these events.\r"

As a first step in the evaluation of the hypothesis that these leukotrienes participate in the edema formation of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we investigated whether LTC4 and LTD4 were present in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with ARDS compared to nonsmoker control subjects and to patients with acute respiratory failure exhibiting no radiographic evidence of widespread pulmonary infiltrates but having a clinical predisposition for developing ARDS, i.e., the \"at risk\" group. Bronchoscopic lavage was performed with sterile 0.9% NaCl on 32 control subjects, nine patients with ARDS, and nine patients \"at risk\" for ARDS. Leukotrienes were measured in BAL fluid by radioimmunoassay after methanol extraction and HPLC purification of a 20-ml aliquot of the BAL sample. LTC4 and LTD4 (mean +/- SE) increased from 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 1.2 +/- 0.5 ng/lavage in the BAL fluid of control subjects to 6.3 +/- 2.3 and 20.1 +/- 5.9 ng/lavage in patients \"at risk\" for ARDS and to 12.5 +/- 3.0 and 30.5 +/- 7.8 ng/lavage in patients with ARDS, respectively. The sulfidopeptide LTs correlated with BAL fluid protein content. These results suggest that increased amounts of LTs in BAL fluid are a general finding in patients with ARDS and those \"at risk\" for ARDS.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, the validity of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards for selection of spirometric test results has been questioned based on the finding of inverse dependence of FEV1 on effort. I carried out a study to determine how the test results of FEV1 and FEF25-75 are affected by use of effort-based criteria (highest PEFR) as compared with the volume-based criteria (largest FVC, largest sum of FVC and FEV1-ATS criteria). Randomly sampled routine pulmonary function test results obtained from 10 normal subjects and 12 patients with COPD were analyzed. Although selection based on the largest FVC yielded test results identical to that obtained by the ATS criteria, selection based on the highest PEFR resulted in a decline of mean FEV1. The latter, however, was accompanied by an even more significant decrease of FVC, suggesting bias of this criterion toward selecting the maneuvers with lower FVC. Furthermore, the individual values of FEV1 were often found to decrease with effort only when the accompanying FVC were also lower. In contrast, FEF25-75 were more prominently affected by the negative effect of effort regardless of the values of accompanying FVC. It appears that fully inflated lungs (the largest FVC) favorably shift the balance of two opposing influences of effort, one of which positively acts on the effort-dependent portion of the flow-volume curve. FEV1 thus is little affected by effort once the lungs are fully inflated. Accordingly, the volume-based selection criteria remain valid. This argument does not apply to FEF25-75, which is prominently affected by the negative effect of effort.\r"

Subjects inhaled repeated doses of either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or histamine, immediately after the inhalation of a radioaerosol and during the subsequent 2.5-h clearance measurements. Histamine was administered in concentrations previously demonstrated to induce a 20% fall in FEV1 at intervals permitting 90% recovery (mean recovery time = 25 min). Both TMV and CB were significantly increased by inhaled histamine (p less than 0.001). Average TMV throughout the 2.5-h studies increased from 4.9 +/- 1.3 to 8.4 +/- 1.6 mm/min. The increase in TMV above control values became apparent from 5 to 20 min after the first histamine administration. The percentage of aerosol clearance in 60 min increased 33%. The enhancement of CB became statistically significant at 21 min and persisted throughout the 2.5-h measurements (p less than 0.05). The increase in CB could not be attributed to differences in aerosol deposition because measurements of aerosol penetration were not significantly different between PBS and histamine studies. These data indicate that the bronchoconstriction caused by histamine is accompanied by an increase in tracheal and bronchial mucus transport. Release of histamine, as part of an inflammatory response, may alter mucociliary clearance in humans.\r"

This study was designed to examine the effects of epithelial-derived products on contraction of airway smooth muscle. To avoid biochemical and physical changes that may be produced by stripping epithelium from tracheal smooth muscle, we examined the effect of products from pure cultured tracheal epithelial cells on intact dog tracheal smooth muscle. When bradykinin (10(-5) M) was added to dog epithelial cells in culture and the supernatant was added to strips of isolated tracheal smooth muscle, contractile responses to electrical field stimulation were significantly inhibited. Pretreatment of the epithelial cells with indomethacin (5.6 x 10(-6) M) inhibited this effect. Bradykinin placed directly on the canine smooth muscle had no effect on resting tension or on the response to electrical field stimulation. Contractions of the smooth muscle to exogenous acetylcholine were unaffected by supernatants from either indomethacin-treated or untreated cells stimulated with bradykinin (10(-5) M) compared to time controls. We conclude that bradykinin stimulates the release of a cyclooxygenase-dependent inhibitory factor from airway epithelial cells. This factor is likely to be prostaglandin E2, which is generated by the epithelial cells in response to bradykinin stimulation and inhibits smooth muscle contraction induced by electrical field stimulation. Although the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown, the normal response to exogenous acetylcholine is consistent with the hypothesis that prostaglandin E2 acts by inhibiting cholinergic neurotransmitter release at a prejunctional site.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether histamine H2-receptors are also involved in the development of this protective effect in the airways. Seven subjects with mild asthma were studied on 2 days separated by at least 1 wk. On both days, three histamine inhalation tests were performed, separated by 1 h. The response was expressed as the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 (histamine PC20). Before each study day subjects were pretreated with placebo or cimetidine (300 mg twice a day) for 3 days in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Cimetidine pretreatment had no effect on either baseline FEV1 or on baseline histamine PC20 (p = 0.461). After pretreatment with placebo, histamine tachyphylaxis occurred in all subjects; the mean PC20 increased from 3.01 mg/ml (%SD, 1.44) to 4.88 mg/ml (%SD, 1.68) and to 6.84 mg/ml (%SD, 1.68). Cimetidine pretreatment prevented histamine tachyphylaxis; the mean PC20 was 2.72 mg/ml (%SD, 1.77), 3.03 mg/ml (%SD, 1.73), and 3.56 mg/ml (%SD, 1.59) with repeated tests. These values differed significantly from placebo for both the second (p = 0.014) and third (p = 0.001) tests. This study demonstrated that cimetidine pretreatment prevents histamine tachyphylaxis and suggests that histamine tachyphylaxis occurs through stimulation of histamine H2-receptors in the airway.\r"

Exercise refractoriness and histamine tachyphylaxis may occur through release of inhibitory mediators in the airways. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prior challenge with exercise or histamine reduced the subsequent bronchoconstriction to the opposite challenge. Eight asthmatic subjects with exercise bronchoconstriction were studied on 4 study days. On each study day, two consecutive tests were separated by 1 h as follows: on Day 1, two exercise challenges; on Day 2, two histamine inhalation tests; on Days 3 and 4, a histamine test was followed by an exercise challenge or an exercise challenge was followed by a histamine test. On Day 1, the mean fall in the FEV1 after the initial exercise challenge was 22.13% (SD, 7.12%); after the second exercise challenge, 1 h later, it was 11.13% (SD, 10.69%) (p less than 0.005). On Day 2, the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was 1.68 mg/ml (%SD, 2.02) for the first test and 2.68 mg/ml (%SD, 1.99) for the second test 1 h later (p less than 0.005). However, after exercise bronchoconstriction, the histamine PC20 was 1.88 mg/ml (%SD, 2.03), not different from the control value (p less than 0.5). In contrast, the fall in FEV1 after exercise after prior inhalation of histamine was 15.63% (SD, 10.0%) compared with 23.13% (SD, 8.6%) on the control day (p less than 0.005). Therefore, inhibitory mediators released during histamine inhalation can cause exercise refractoriness; however, the converse is not true.\r"

The patients were randomly allocated into two groups, one receiving two puffs (400 micrograms) of fenoterol and the other two puffs of placebo, from a metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind fashion. The following procedure was used: premedication with 0.5 mg atropine sulfate and 100 mg hydroxyzine administered intramuscularly; 50 min later, aerosol administration; 10 min after aerosol administration, a standardized topical anesthesia was performed. As soon as the bronchofiberscope had entered the trachea, sounds were recorded for a 5-min period, while the tracheobronchial tree was systematically inspected. Additional lidocaine (2% solution, 2 ml boluses) was injected into the airways if troublesome cough occurred. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, sex ratio, and smoking history. In contrast, both the number of coughs and the volume (ml) of additional lidocaine were significantly smaller in the fenoterol group than in the placebo group: m +/- SEM: 35.0 +/- 5.5 versus 51.6 +/- 6.5, p less than 0.01 and 1.9 +/- 0.5 versus 3.3 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.01, respectively. Thus, fenoterol exhibits antitussive properties and can usefully be administered before bronchofiberscopy.\r"

The diagnosis of work-related asthma was initially confirmed in all of them by specific inhalation challenges at the workplace or by laboratory inhalation of snow-crab boiling water (n = 24) or by serial monitoring of airway caliber and bronchial responsiveness to histamine at work and off work (n = 7). Total duration of work-related exposure was 12.8 +/- 5.6 months (range, 3 to 21 months), and the duration of symptoms after onset was 6.8 +/- 4.2 months (range, 1 to 18 months). At the time of diagnosis, all 31 subjects required medication for asthma, 11 had a FEV1 less than or equal to 85% predicted, and all subjects had a PC20 less than or equal to 16 mg/ml. Twelve of 25 serum samples assessed showed high levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to crab meat and/or boiling water. At the time of the first follow-up, there was a reduction in the number of subjects still requiring medication, with a significant reduction in FEV1, and a PC20 less than or equal to 16 mg/ml. However, no further change was observed afterwards. Similarly, the mean FEV1 and FEV1/FVC improved significantly from the time of diagnosis to the first follow-up (p less than 0.01), with a plateau thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In those working with calcined clay, there was an increased prevalence of abnormality of the FEV1, but not the FVC, when compared to both wet and dry processors and which could not be explained by either cigarette smoking or the presence of pneumoconiosis. The magnitude of abnormality in the calcined clay workers was, however, unlikely to lead to disabling impairment. In workers with more than 3-yr tenure, there were 90 subjects with simple pneumoconiosis and 18 with complicated pneumoconiosis, yielding an adjusted prevalence of 3.2% and 0.63%, respectively, in the sample examined. Dry processing was associated with a greater risk of developing pneumoconiosis than wet processing.\r"

Each subject did the same exercise each day, but exercise intensity and duration varied widely between subjects, with minute ventilation ranging from 20 to 153 L and duration ranging from 15 to 55 min. Spirometry was performed immediately before and after each exercise period. O3 concentrations during exercise ranged from 21 to 124 parts per billion (ppb). All measured functional indexes showed significant (p less than 0.01) O3-associated mean decrements with FVC at -2.1 ml/ppb, FEV1 at -1.4 ml/ppb, PEFR at -9.2 ml/s/ppb, FEF25-75 at -6.0 ml/s/ppb, and FEV1/FVC at -0.038%/ppb. Mean decrements were smaller for 10 subjects with minute ventilations greater than 100 L than for 10 other subjects with minute ventilations between 60 and 100 L or for the 10 subjects with minute ventilations below 60 L. Overall, the functional decrements were similar in magnitude to those we have seen in children engaged in supervised recreational programs in summer camps. For 10 subjects with minute ventilations comparable to those used in controlled 1- and 2-h exposures to O3 in purified air in chambers (50 to 80 L), the effects were about twice as large as those reported for the chamber studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous cross-sectional analyses of data from the Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airways Obstructive Diseases have shown significant relationships of ventilatory impairment to a variety of risk factors, including smoking, chronic productive cough, a history of childhood respiratory illnesses, atopy, blood eosinophilia, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). In the present report, we reexamine these relationships in subjects 40 to 74 yr of age to determine the effect of excluding known asthmatics who, as a group, have markedly impaired lung function. After exclusion of asthmatics, atopy, eosinophilia, and IgE no longer appear to be significant risk factors for ventilatory impairment, and nonasthmatic nonsmokers show almost no remaining ventilatory impairment. In current smokers, quantitative relationships of FEV1 to pack-years of cigarette consumption and to chronic productive cough are changed little by excluding asthmatics. In nonasthmatic ex-smokers, however, age at quitting smoking adds significantly to prediction of FEV1 after accounting for pack-years. Young ex-smokers closely resemble nonsmokers, but they become increasingly similar to current smokers as their age at quitting increases. A history of respiratory trouble before 16 yr of age continues to appear to increase susceptibility to smoking effects, even after exclusion of asthmatics. But, as in previous studies, the possible bias of preferential recall of childhood illnesses by impaired subjects limits interpretations of this observation. On the other hand, present findings suggest that such factors as atopy, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE may well be risk factors for persistent asthma, but they have no relationship to nonasthmatic forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic investigations into the natural history of airway obstructive disease have focused on both the growth and decline of lung function measurements. Although a general picture has emerged as to overall patterns of growth/decline, uncertainty remains with regard to important details of these patterns. Pulmonary function data from subjects aged 5 yr and and older who participated in any or all of the first 10 annual surveys of the East Boston population-based study have been used to investigate patterns of growth and decline of lung function derived from maximal forced expiratory maneuvers. At each annual survey, subjects completed a standardized respiratory illness and smoking questionnaire and provided forced expiratory volume-time curves from which forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were derived. A nonparametric curve smoothing method was used to provide an overall summary of growth and decline of each measure of function. Asymptomatic, nonsmoking males demonstrated a pattern of growth of FEV1 that included a prolonged plateau phase or period of slow, continued growth from ages 23 to 35 yr. Decline in lung function began after this period and occurred in two phases that averaged about -20 and -30 ml/yr. In contrast, no plateau phase was observed for male current smokers. In these smokers, decline in FEV1 began in the early part of the third decade at a rate only slightly greater than that observed for nonsmokers (-25 to -30 ml/yr). Similar patterns and rates of decline were observed for females, although the presence of a plateau phase was less clearly discernible. These data suggest that a major effect of cigarette smoking on lung function decline involves the premature onset of a \"normal\" rate of decline in function and, to a lesser extent, more rapid rates of decline later in life and that the pattern and magnitude of decline is similar in males and females.\r"

We have therefore looked at objective and subjective evidence of beneficial and adverse effects after 4 doses of albuterol in 30 patients with chronic bronchitis, severe airflow limitation, and less than 200 ml increase in FEV1 after 200 micrograms inhaled albuterol. Subjects were given placebo, 400 micrograms, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg albuterol by dry powder inhaler in random order on separate days in a double-blind study, and FEV1, relaxed VC, PEFR, 12-min walk distance, finger tremor, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and arrhythmias were measured at intervals over 6 h. With increasing doses of albuterol, there was a significant dose-related increase in FEV1, VC, and PEFR, the maximal mean changes being 196 ml, 480 ml, and 50 L/min, respectively. The duration of effect was longer with the higher doses. There was a dose-related increase in heart rate, tremor amplitude, and supraventricular ectopic beats and a dose-related fall in oxygen saturation. There was no drug-related effect on the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats either at rest or during the walk tests. The largest increases in walk distance occurred after the 1 and 2 mg doses and the least after the 4 mg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During each exercise period, we recorded endoesophageal (PpI), gastric (Pg), and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures along with heart rate, respiratory rate, and endurance time. Expired gas was collected to determine oxygen uptake (VO2) and minute ventilation (VE). Exercise endurance was shorter for UAE than for SAE (210 +/- 114 versus 270 +/- 120 s, p less than 0.05), even though peak exercise heart rate (113 +/- 5 versus 122 +/- 7 beats/min, p less than 0.05), VO2 (5.9 +/- 0.5 versus 7.1 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.05) and VE (16.5 +/- 1.2 versus 19.8 +/- 1.3 L/min, p less than 0.05) were lower for UAE. Mean (+/- SD) values for changes in pleural (delta PpI) and gastric (delta Pg) pressures during either type of arm exercise were significantly greater than at rest (p less than 0.02). In eight of 11 patients during UAE, the changes between end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transdiaphragmatic pressure (delta Pdi) were observed to develop in a similar pattern. In these patients, end-inspiratory Pg was more positive and end-inspiratory PpI was less negative during UAE than during SAE (p less than 0.02). In addition, PpI at end expiration was markedly positive when performing UAE (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Severe diaphragm dysfunction was confirmed by the demonstration of the very low maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated by either a sniff (13 +/- 6 cm H2O, normal 148 +/- 24) or a static inspiration (11 +/- 8, normal 108 +/- 30) and during bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation (0.8 +/- 2.0, normal 22 +/- 4). Resting arterial blood gases were normal (SaO2 = 95 to 97%) and no oxygen desaturation occurred during maximal exercise on a treadmill. Maximum voluntary ventilation was low and related to PImax (r = 0.89). Overnight sleep monitoring showed that time spent in rapid eye movement sleep was normal (mean 55 +/- 36 min, range 26 to 117 min). Mean maximum increment in transcutaneous CO2 was within normal limits (6 +/- 2 mm Hg, range 3 to 9 mm Hg). Three patients had occasional brief episodes of oxygen desaturation (mean maximal decrease 13 +/- 10%, range 2 to 27%); however, only two of these spent a measurable proportion of total sleep time (TST) with an SaO2 of less than 80% (1% and 3% TST, respectively). No patient has developed any symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation or chronic respiratory failure during periods of observation of up to five yr. We conclude that bilateral paralysis or very severe weakness of the diaphragm does not of itself lead to respiratory failure unless weakness of other respiratory muscles is present.\r"

Vital capacity (VC) (70.9 +/- 19.0% predicted) was abnormal in 12 patients. Transdiaphragmatic pressure recorded during maximal sniffs (sniff Pdl) was reduced in eight patients, whereas pressure recorded during bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at 1 Hz (twitch Pdi) was reduced in only three. There was no relationship between the grade of myasthenia or the severity of dyspnea and any of the measurements of respiratory muscle strength. After the administration of edrophonium hydrochloride (Tensilon), there was a significant increase in maximal static expiratory and inspiratory mouth pressures in quadriceps muscle strength and in sniff Pdi. The small increase in VC was not significant, and twitch Pdi increased in only one patient. Phrenic nerve conduction time was normal before and after Tensilon. Two patients with severe long-standing myasthenia showed no improvement in any measurement after Tensilon. We conclude that expiratory and inspiratory muscle weakness was not uncommon in patients with myasthenia gravis. Respiratory muscle strength improved after Tensilon. Vital capacity was a less sensitive measure of respiratory muscle strength than were respiratory mouth pressures and sniff Pdi. Diaphragmatic involvement was not detected by twitch Pdi unless the weakness was severe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent data in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggest that periods of frequent eye movements may be associated with hypoxemia during REM sleep. We have therefore investigated the association between eye movements and ventilation and ventilatory pattern in 10 normal men. Expired ventilation was measured using a pneumotachograph attached to a valved face mask with a dead space of 50 ml and incorporating a peripheral CO2 leak detector. Ventilation was reduced (p less than 0.02) in all stages of sleep compared with that during wakefulness, with no difference between the level of ventilation in each sleep stage (awake, 7.18 +/- 0.43 SEM; Stage 2, 6.47 +/- 0.43; Stage 3/4, 6.45 +/- 0.52; REM sleep, 6.55 +/- 0.47 L/min). During REM sleep, eye movements (EMs) were associated with rapid shallow breathing. Dividing REM into 20-s epochs with or without EMs, EMs were associated with a raised breathing frequency (no EMs, 14.4 +/- 0.4 breaths/min; EMs, 15.8 +/- 0.5 breaths/min; p = 0.01), reduced tidal volume (0.49 +/- 0.03 L; 0.41 +/- 0.03 L; p less than 0.01), and reduced minute ventilation (6.87 +/- 0.45 L; 6.27 +/- 0.51 L; p = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effective dose inhibiting 75% of the mycobacterial population (ED 75) was estimated by a regression analysis on the probit transformed inhibition percentages and plotted on an isobologram for each combination. No major discrepancies were found between strains. Five combinations (RMP plus INH, RMP plus EMB, EMB plus SM, INH plus EMB, and ETH plus INH) showed synergistic effect, whereas five other combinations (ETH plus EMB, ETH plus RMP, ETH plus SM, SM plus RMP, and SM plus INH) showed antagonistic effect. These in vitro results are not in combination with the known results of treatment of the M. avium diseases. We conclude that the effect of drug combinations against M. avium may be strain dependent and that it is important to determine this effect in vitro before setting up a treatment protocol.\r"

The blood kinetics of the three antituberculosis drugs were determined on Days 1, 15, 30, and 60 of treatment. The triple combination employed in this study contained 50 mg isoniazid, 120 mg rifampin, and 300 mg pyrazinamide per tablet, the number of tablets ranging from four to seven per day according to the body weight of the patients. Almost superimposable plasma concentration curves for isoniazid were observed during the 4 days of the study. For rifampin, a fall in the plasma concentrations at the time intervals after the peak was observed comparing the data on Day 1 with those on Days 15, 30, and 60, which did not differ from each other. This finding is thought to be due to the well-known phenomenon of self-induction, which leads to an increased rate of disposal of the antibiotic from the blood compartment within the first and second weeks of continuous treatment. For pyrazinamide, an equilibrium in the opposite sense as that of rifampin seemed to take place within the 2 months of the study. Because of the relatively high plasma levels observed 24 h after each administration, an increase in plasma concentrations with respect to those observed on Day 1 was found on Days 15, 30, and 60, the levels on these days no differing from each other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because other patients in Ward 8A were at risk of developing disease with M. fortuitum, microbiologic surveillance to identify colonization in sputum was begun. By February 15, 1986, 30 colonized patients had been identified in this ward but none in another ward with a comparable patient population, which suggests a source unique to Ward 8A. Because water has been recognized as a source of opportunistic mycobacterial pathogens, we conducted a retrospective case-control study using a telephone survey questionnaire to examine a number of water exposures in 10 patients and 20 control subjects. Exposure to ice from the Ward 8A ice machine, but not to potable water, was associated with colonization with M. fortuitum. Large-volume water samples from a variety of sources were cultured for acid-fast bacilli. M. fortuitum was isolated only from the ice machine in Ward 8A. The ice machine was disconnected, and no additional patients became colonized. Although ice machines are infrequently implicated in nosocomial outbreaks, they represent a potential source for pathogens that survive or replicate in water.\r"

Characterization of their role in health and disease has been hampered by inadequate methods to separate interstitial from residual alveolar macrophages (AMs) in preparations of individual mononuclear cells from lung tissue. In this study, a specific cell-surface antigen (HAM1) present on more than 90% of hamster AMs, but not expressed by hamster IMs, was used to distinguish these populations. After collagenase digestion of lung tissue slices from exhaustively lavaged and perfused hamster lungs, mononuclear phagocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The mean yield of lung digest macrophages (3.9 +/- 1.9 (SD) x 10(6] was comparable to the yield of lavaged AMs (4.2 +/- 1.9 x 10(6]. The proliferative capacity of lavaged AMs, blood monocytes, and lung digest macrophages was compared using a soft-agar colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Both lung digest macrophages and blood monocytes had significantly more CFUs (68.7 +/- 2.6 and 53.5 +/- 8.4 CFU/10(3) cells [mean +/- SEM], respectively) than did AMs (16.5 +/- 1.7) (p less than 0.01). To further define the composition of the lung digest macrophage population, flow cytometric analysis of fixed cells from six experiments was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the HAM1 antigen found only on AMs. The lung digest macrophage population consisted of both antigen-negative IMs (78.2% +/- 3.7% [SEM]; n = 6) and antigen-positive, residual AMs (21.8% +/- 3.7%). Morphometric counts confirmed that substantial numbers of AMs are left behind after lavage and contribute to macrophages obtained from lung tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) has been shown to inhibit acute inflammatory reactions involving vascular permeability changes and subsequent tissue damage caused by immune complex deposition and other inflammatory mediators. These effects have been postulated to be due to functional changes induced in circulating neutrophils by PGE1. We evaluated the ability of PGE1 (1 to 100 microM) to protect endothelial cells (EC) from neutrophil injury induced by C5a or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The injury to endothelial monolayers was quantitated by 51Cr loss after an 18-h incubation. In the presence of PGE1, there was a concentration-dependent inhibition of C5a- or PMA-stimulated human neutrophil injury to EC. The protective effect was more effective by pretreatment of neutrophils than EC. Since neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells is thought to be an early event in the sequence resulting in injury to vascular endothelium, we next evaluated the effect of PGE1 on neutrophil adherence to plastic surfaces and EC. In a similar fashion, there was a concentration-dependent inhibition of neutrophil adherence to plastic and EC following stimulation with PMA (10 ng/ml), human C5a (5 micrograms/ml) or formyl-met-leu-phe (FMLP, 2 x 10(-7) M). To investigate a possible mechanism of inhibition of neutrophil adherence to plastic surfaces or EC, expression of the neutrophil surface protein Mo1, previously shown to be associated with increased granulocyte adherence, was measured by fluorescence flow cytometry. Although basal levels of Mo1 expression by unstimulated neutrophils were diminished by PGE1 treatment, there was no significant inhibition of PMA- or FMLP-stimulated Mo1 expression in PGE1-treated neutrophils compared with neutrophils stimulated in the absence of PGE1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Marked damage to the endothelium is associated with the pulmonary hypertension that develops during in vivo exposure to hyperoxia at normobaric pressures. We hypothesized that endothelial cell damage may contribute to initial increases in vascular tone during the development of hypertension by altering the metabolism of vasoactive compounds and/or modulating vessel responses to those agents that require an intact endothelium for their actions. This study reports the effects of in vivo hyperoxic damage to the lung on the pharmacologic properties of isolated pulmonary vessels. Proximal pulmonary arteries isolated from adult and weanling rats that breathed 85% O2 for 7 days were studied using myograph techniques. Isometric tension development was recorded in response to the cumulative addition of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and the ability of acetylcholine (ACh) to relax precontracted vessels was subsequently assessed. Sensitivities to PGF2 alpha were increased in both adult and weanling hyperoxic vessels relative to control. Conversely, relaxation to acetylcholine was reduced following hyperoxic injury. Control vessels relaxed completely to acetylcholine addition, while only a 30% relaxation was recorded in adult hyperoxic arteries and a 50% relaxation was measured in weanling hyperoxic tissues. This effect on vasodilation was specific for the endothelium-dependent dilator ACh. By contrast, relaxation responses to sodium nitroprusside and papaverine, endothelium-independent agonists, were unaffected following hyperoxic injury. These results demonstrate that in vivo exposure to high O2 concentrations increases the sensitivity of isolated pulmonary arteries to the vasoconstrictor PGF2 alpha and markedly diminishes the ability of ACh to relax precontracted pulmonary vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this heritable disease, the pathogenetic basis of disease should be distinct within families, and the pathologic lesions should reflect the underlying biologic mechanisms. Two pathologic types of primary pulmonary hypertension have been proposed to exist, \"plexogenic\" and \"thromboembolic.\" The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and variety of pathologic lesions in families with familial primary pulmonary hypertension and to discover whether the pattern of pathologic lesions found supported the existence of two types of disease. We found marked heterogeneity of pathologic lesions within and among families, including frequent coexistence of thrombotic and plexiform lesions. We conclude that the lesions found in primary pulmonary hypertension are not specific but represent different manifestations of the same pathologic process. Thus, plexiform and thrombotic lesions of the pulmonary arterioles may not arise from distinctly different biologic processes but may simply be different manifestations of the same process. Further insights in primary pulmonary hypertension must come from study of the biologic aspects of the intimal lesion.\r"

However, the involvement of such injury in the inflammatory response associated with the inhalation of asbestos fibers is unclear and the mechanism of asbestos fiber cytotoxicity remains unknown. In the present study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were challenged with amosite asbestos and several parameters of cellular function were examined. Electron microscopic examination revealed that endothelial cell exposure to asbestos resulted in active phagocytosis of these particulates. Biochemical evidence of dose-dependent asbestos-mediated endothelial cell activation was indicated by increased metabolism of arachidonic acid. For example, amosite asbestos (500 micrograms/ml) produced a ninefold increase in prostacyclin (PGI2) levels over those levels in non-exposed cells. Incubation of human endothelial cells with asbestos fibers induced specific 51Cr release in both a dose- and time-dependent fashion indicative of cellular injury. Injury induced by amosite asbestos was not significantly attenuated by treatment of the endothelial cell monolayer with either the iron chelator deferoxamine, which prevents hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation, or by the superoxide anion (O2-) scavenger, superoxide dismutase. However, significant dose-dependent protection was observed with the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger, catalase. Chelation of elemental iron present within amosite asbestos fibers by deferoxamine produced a 33% reduction in asbestos cytotoxicity, suggesting a potential role for hydroxyl radical-mediated injury via the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in tuberculosis, we extensively evaluated a patient with tuberculosis, hypercalcemia, and an elevated plasma concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3. Fresh total cells and cultured alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage were demonstrated to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D3 prior to and after nine months of successful antituberculous therapy. The continued capacity to produce 1,25(OH)2D3 was associated with a persistent lymphocytic alveolitis in this patient. This extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)2D3 probably contributed to the increased levels of plasma 1,25(OH)2D observed in our patient. Nevertheless, a close correlation between plasma 1,25(OH)2D and serum calcium was not observed. These findings suggest that although extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)2D3 occurs in tuberculosis, it need not be a predominant factor producing the abnormalities in calcium homeostasis observed in such patients.\r"

  ".W": "The potentiation of fatal bacterial pneumonia in mice by prior inhalation of ozone occurs at levels of this oxidant pollutant that are frequently present in ambient air. A likely mechanism for this effect is an ozone-induced inhibition in the ability of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) to produce superoxide anion radical (O2-) demonstrated in the present study. A 25% decrease in PAM O2- production, as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, occurred after exposure of Swiss-Webster mice to 0.11 ppm ozone for 3 h (p less than 0.05). After 1 ppm there was almost complete inhibition of O2- release. In contrast, the rat, which is highly resistant to the potentiation of bacterial infections by ozone, was less sensitive to inhibition of PAM O2- production, as measured by cytochrome c reduction (mouse IC50, 0.41 ppm; rat IC50, 3.0 ppm ozone for 3 h). The observed decrement in mouse PAM O2- production was not associated with any change in phagocytic ability, as measured by both latex bead ingestion and 51Cr-labeled sheep red blood cell ingestion. This decrease in O2- production in the presence of normal phagocytic activity is analogous to certain of the findings in the neutrophils of children with chronic granulomatous disease. A decrease in rat PAM membrane cytochrome b558 levels was observed after ozone exposure of 3 ppm for 3 h, preliminarily suggesting that the mechanism by which ozone interferes with PAM O2- production may be through interaction with this heme-containing electron carrier.\r"

The immediate response appears to be dependent on the presence of IgE antibody and mast cell mediator release. Although the late phase of dual responses is considered to be related to or a continuum of the immediate hypersensitivity response, its precise pathogenesis remains to be determined. To increase both the sensitivity and specificity of analyzing the pathogenesis of IgE-dependent pulmonary responses, we have used a Sprague-Dawley rat model system in which rats are passively sensitized with a murine monoclonal IgE anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) antibody prior to challenge with DNP-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA). Pathogen-free rats were injected with IgE or saline in a randomized blinded protocol, and in 24 to 48 h were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg intraperitoneally) and instrumented to measure lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Rats were then challenged with aerosolized DNP-BSA (10 mg/ml), and RL and Cdyn monitored through 7 h after challenge. Both RL (0.30 +/- 0.10 versus 0.13 +/- 0.02 cm H2O/ml.sec-1) and Cdyn (0.41 +/- 0.10 versus 0.25 +/- 0.08 ml/cm H2O) were significantly different (p less than 0.05) in sensitized rats compared to control rats immediately after challenge. No late changes were observed in either the treated or control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, we used the acoustic reflection technique to measure the airway cross-sectional area in 14 asthmatic subjects and 8 normal controls before and following treadmill exercise tests. In normal subjects, exercise caused no significant change in FEV1 and bronchial area, but did cause a significant increase in the intrathoracic tracheal area from 2.0 +/- 0.7 cm2 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p less than 0.002). In the asthmatics, exercise was followed by a 37 +/- 15% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s(FEV1), and a 36% decrease in bronchial area from 8.5 +/- 2.8 cm2 to 5.4 +/- 1.1 cm2 (p less than 0.001); however, extra- and intrathoracic tracheal areas increased significantly. These findings provide direct and quantitative evidence that the bronchi are the main site of airway narrowing in exercise-induced asthma, and draw attention to the phenomenon of tracheal dilatation that occurs concomitant with bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients.\r"

The frequency and tidal volume of spontaneous breaths increased at lower levels of mechanical ventilation, but inspiratory time fraction did not vary across the spectrum of machine support. As machine support was withdrawn, inspiratory work and pressure-time product increased progressively for both spontaneous and assisted breathing cycles. On a per cycle basis, work output was greater for assisted than for spontaneous breaths at all levels of comparison. Although the mean pressure developed by the patient during assisted cycles averaged approximately equal to 20% less than during adjacent unassisted cycles, contraction time averaged approximately equal to 20% longer, so that the pressure-time products were nearly equivalent for both types of cycle. Two indices of force reserve indicated that our patients taxed their maximal ventilatory capability at all but the highest levels of support. We conclude that under the conditions of this study the ventilatory pump continued to be active at all levels of machine assistance. Although work per liter related linearly to the proportion of minute ventilation borne by the patient, force generation differed little for spontaneous and machine-aided breaths at any specified level of support. Whether judged on the basis of mean developed pressure (work per liter of ventilation) or pressure-time product, little effort adaptation to volume-cycled machine assistance appears to occur on a breath-by-breath basis.\r"

We studied the effects of digoxin on isometric force production, fatigue, and recovery in isolated, directly stimulated, guinea pig and rat diaphragms. Digoxin had no effect on maximal twitch or tetanic tensions compared with control diaphragms in either rat (2 ng/ml to 20 micrograms/ml) or guinea pig (2 ng/ml to 2 micrograms/ml) hemidiaphragms. Digoxin worsened high frequency fatigue and impaired recovery from fatigue in guinea pigs (200 ng/ml to 2 micrograms/ml) but not in rat (2 micrograms/ml) hemidiaphragms. We conclude that digoxin has no effect on diaphragm contractility. Hypopolarization of the membrane potential is the likely cause for the increased fatigability. The difference in responsiveness between species is likely due to insensitivity of rat sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase to digoxin.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that improvement in OSA after weight loss is associated with improvement in pharyngeal function. Consequently, we measured pharyngeal area at functional residual capacity (AFRC) and at residual volume (ARV), the percent change in pharyngeal area between FRC and RV (delta Aph%) defined as (AFRC - ARV)/AFRC x 100, and lung volume dependence of pharyngeal area (LVD) defined as the difference between AFRC and ARV normalized for the expiratory reserve volume (ERV)--in 12 overweight apneic patients before and after weight loss. We found that after a 26 +/- 18 kg weight loss, there was a significant reduction in the apnea/hypopnea index from 57 +/- 29 to 14 +/- 10 (p less than 0.0005) and increase in the lowest nocturnal oxygen saturation from 54 +/- 20% to 80 +/- 8% (p less than 0.001). This improvement was associated with a significant reduction in delta Aph% from 25 +/- 15% to 9 +/- 18% (p less than 0.05) and a significant decrease in LVD from 1.98 +/- 1.52 cm2/L to 0.16 +/- 0.88 cm2/L (p less than 0.005). There were four patients in whom baseline LVD was low and relatively unchanged after weight loss. Three of these patients exhibited paradoxical inspiratory narrowing of the glottis, which reversed after weight loss; these glottic abnormalities were not present in the rest of the patients with OSA. We conclude that improvement in obstructive sleep apnea after weight loss may be related to improvement in pharyngeal and glottic function.\r"

Young adult female Long-Evans rats were divided into seven groups: (1) untreated controls; (2) low nicotine cigarette smoke exposure (Kentucky 2A1 reference cigarettes; 35.0 mg total particulate matter, 0.42 mg nicotine, and 0.38 mg nitrogen oxides per cigarette); (3) high nicotine cigarette smoke exposure (Kentucky 2R1 reference cigarettes; 38.8 mg total particulate matter, 2.2 mg nicotine, and 0.34 mg nitrogen oxides per cigarette; (4) PPE alone; (5) PPE + sham smoke exposure; (6) PPE + 2A1 smoke exposure; and (7) PPE + 2R1 smoke exposure. Three days after intratracheal administration of PPE (400 IU/kg), animals in the smoke-treated groups were exposed to 10 puffs of cigarette smoke daily, 7 days/wk for 14 wk. Sham-treated animals received room air in place of cigarette smoke. After the exposures, pulmonary function tests were performed under general anesthesia. Whole lungs were examined for gross pathologic changes, and samples of lung tissue were harvested for quantitative morphometry. Cigarette smoke exposure alone did not produce significant changes in pulmonary function or structure. On the other hand, treatment with elastase alone produced a constellation of pulmonary functional and structural changes that were pathognomonic of emphysema. Exposure to 2R1 but not 2A1 cigarette smoke significantly augmented the emphysematous changes produced by PPE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In another case-control study of 487 dead South African asbestos miners, no positive association between smoking and autopsy findings for asbestosis was observed (OR = 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.20; 1.29). The association between greater than slight asbestosis (moderate and marked) and smoking (yes/no) was not significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.44), and the adjusted odds ratio was 1.25 with 95% confidence interval (0.20; 7.78). In addition, the certification in life for asbestosis, based on chest roentgenogram readings for irregular opacities, was also found to have a tendency to be related to smoking. Thus, the findings of these studies do not support the hypothesis that smoking is associated with the presence of asbestosis at autopsy or that smoking and asbestos dust act synergistically in producing asbestosis at autopsy. But the findings of this and other studies suggest that smoking does produce some change in the lung structure that can be visible on the roentgenogram and can be wrongly interpreted as irregular opacities caused by asbestosis.\r"

  ".W": "Data presented here indicate that freshly fractured silica exhibits surface characteristics and biologic reactivity distinct from aged silica, and on this basis we propose that these surface features may lead to enhanced manifestations of lung injury. Grinding of silica produces approximately 10(18) Si and Si-O (silicon-based) radicals per gram of dust on the particulate surface which are characterized by an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum centered around g = 2.0015. These silicon-based radicals react with aqueous media to produce OH radicals, which are demonstrable using a DMPO spin trap. The concentration of silicon-based radicals in silica decreases with aging in air and exhibits a half-life of approximately 30 h, whereas its ability to generate OH radicals in aqueous solution decreases with a half-life of approximately 20 h. However, on storage in aqueous media, the concentration of silicon-based radicals and the dust's ability to generate OH radicals decrease significantly within a few minutes. Freshly ground silica is also more biologically reactive than aged silica, because freshly crushed silica activates a greater respiratory burst in alveolar macrophages than aged silica, i.e., storage of ground dust in air decreases silica-induced superoxide anion secretion, hydrogen peroxide release, and NBT reduction by 25%, 68%, and 43%, respectively. Furthermore, compared to aged silica, freshly ground silica exhibits a greater cytotoxic effect on cellular membrane integrity, i.e., a 1.5-fold increase in LDH release from macrophages, a 36-fold increase in hemolytic activity, and a three-fold increase in the ability to induce lipid peroxidation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sheep were irradiated with 1,500 rads to the whole chest except for blocking the heart and adjacent ventral lung. Seven experimental sheep were given methylprednisolone (1 g intravenously every 6 h for four doses) and thoracic irradiation; control sheep received only irradiation. In irradiated control sheep, lung lymph flow increased from baseline (7.6 ml/h) to peak at 3 h (13.2), and lung lymph protein clearance increased from 5.1 to 9.7 ml/h. Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased in the irradiated control sheep from 19 to 32.4 cm H2O, whereas the lung lymph thromboxane concentration increased from 0.09 to 6.51 ng/ml at 3 h. Arterial oxygen tension in irradiated control sheep fell gradually from 86 mm Hg at baseline to 65 mm Hg at 8 h. Methylprednisolone administration significantly prevented the increase in lung lymph protein clearance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and lung lymph thromboxane concentration. Methylprednisolone also prevented the fall in arterial oxygen tension after thoracic irradiation, but did not prevent a further decrease in lymphocytes in blood or lung lymph after radiation. We conclude that corticosteroid therapy prevents most of the acute physiologic changes caused by thoracic irradiation in awake sheep.\r"

In 19 infants, a comparison was made between jacket off and jacket on with the arms held inside the jacket. With the jacket on (arms inside), we found a significant reduction in thoracic gas volume (TGV). Passive compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) was also significantly decreased, while the resistance of the respiratory system (Rrs) was significantly increased. An additional 10 infants were studied comparing jacket off with jacket on (arms outside) and jacket on (arms inside). TGV was significantly less with the jacket on (arms inside) compared to jacket off and jacket on (arms outside), while Rrs and mouth pressure at end-inspiratory occlusion (Pm) were significantly increased. There was no difference between jacket off and jacket on (arms outside). These observations suggest that the squeeze jacket with the arms held at the infant's side inside the jacket exerts a restricting effect on chest and abdominal wall movement and leads to errors in the measurements. To avoid these potential errors, measurements should be made without the jacket on or with the arms held outside the jacket.\r"

An antiserum to rat lysozyme stained type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. In rat lungs, no staining of the airway cells was noted. Lysozyme was detectable in type II pneumocytes by immunocytochemistry and by a quantitative immunoassay of lung homogenates of fetal lungs at Day 20 of gestation. An increase in the lysozyme content of the lung with increasing gestational and postnatal age of the rat was noted. In adult animals, lysozyme accounts for about 169.0 micrograms/g of wet lung weight and 0.3% of the soluble proteins in lung homogenate. Lysozyme constitutes about 6.6% of the total soluble proteins in rat lung lavage. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were used to demonstrate that rat type II pneumocytes synthesize and secrete lysozyme in vitro. However, in human lungs, lysozyme was identified in serous submucosal glands but not in alveolar type II pneumocytes. The results demonstrate differential distribution of a secretory protein in rodent and human lungs and indicate that in the rat lysozyme could be used as an immunohistologic marker for type II pneumocytes and as an indicator of secretory activity and maturation of type II pneumocytes.\r"

In the adult rat alveolus, alkaline phosphatase staining selectively identified type II cells, although nonciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells and loose perivascular connective tissue also stained for alkaline phosphatase activity. In cell suspensions of type II cells and other dissociated lung cells, alkaline phosphatase staining correlated closely with the modified Papanicolaou technique and was particularly useful in distinguishing type II cells from alveolar macrophages. To determine if alkaline phosphatase was related to the differentiated phenotype of type II cells, we studied conditions known to affect other type II cell functions. When type II cells were cultured on plastic substrata, the intensity of alkaline phosphatase staining decreased with increasing time in culture. To quantitate the apparent decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity, we used a biochemical assay to study the expression of alkaline phosphatase by type II cells. The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase in type II cells declined with increasing time in tissue culture on plastic substrata. Alkaline phosphatase activity was maintained, however, by culturing cells on Englebreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor matrix. Cells that had reduced levels of alkaline phosphatase activity following 48 h of culture on plastic substrata could be \"rescued\" by removing them from the plastic substratum and reculturing them for 48 h on EHS matrix. Alkaline phosphatase activity was also increased by culturing type II cells in the presence of cAMP or sodium butyrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of cigarette smoke on the development of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in hamsters, four experimental groups were studied: a control group (C), a cigarette smoke-inhaled group (T), a BLM-administered group (B), and a cigarette smoke-inhaled plus BLM-administered group (TB). Groups T and TB were exposed to sidestream smoke of cigarettes for 30 min/day, 5 days/wk. Groups B and TB were administered 0.5 mg BLM hydrochloride per 100 g body weight endotracheally once on day 30 (Day 0) after housing start. Quantitative morphometry of the lungs revealed that Group TB showed less lung fibrotic change compared with Group B, but based on qualitative observation, the fibrotic lesions of Group TB were intermingled with slight emphysematous changes. Neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were remarkably increased in both the groups, with a peak on Day 1, but the increase in Group TB lasted longer. Alveolar macrophages were increased in both smoking groups (T and TB) compared to the non-smoking groups (C and B). These results suggest that cigarette smoke reduces BLM-induced lung fibrotic changes; however, it simultaneously causes derangement of alveolar architecture. The persistence of increased neutrophils in the early phase after BLM accompanied by exposure to cigarette smoke may play an important role in the mechanism by which smoke ameliorates the effect of BLM.\r"

  ".W": "Extravascular, primarily intra-alveolar, fibrin deposition is a histologic hallmark of acute lung injury in humans and experimental animals, but the mechanisms leading to this finding are poorly understood. To determine whether local abnormalities in the fibrinolytic-procoagulant balance contribute to alveolar fibrin deposition in acute lung injury, we studied bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of anesthetized sheep that received intravenous oleic acid. Prominent alveolar fibrin deposition was observed within 2 h after oleic acid-induced lung injury. Procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities were determined in BAL samples of anesthetized, mechanically ventilated sheep before and 2 h after intravenous oleic acid or saline. BAL procoagulant activity was found to be due mainly to tissue factor associated with Factor VII. In baseline BAL samples, we found relatively low levels of procoagulant activity and relatively high levels of fibrinolytic activity. After induction of oleic acid-induced lung injury, the procoagulant activity of BAL was markedly increased, whereas fibrinolytic activity was either depressed or undetectable. Antiplasmin activity was detectable in BAL of sheep after oleic acid-induced lung injury, which contributed at least in part to the depressed fibrinolytic activity observed. These perturbations occurred with the appearance of extensive alveolar fibrin deposition. In control sheep, BAL fibrinolytic activity was decreased, and antiplasmin activity increased modestly after 2 h of mechanical ventilation, but procoagulant activity was unchanged and alveolar fibrin was not observed. Procoagulant activity in lung lymph and plasma after lung injury did not differ from baseline values, and fibrinolytic activity was undetectable in lymph or plasma samples. These data indicate that increased procoagulant activity and concurrent disruption of the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis establish local conditions that promote acute fibrin deposition in the alveoli of mechanically ventilated, oleic acid-injured sheep.\r"

Mucosal edema is thought to be an important component of the airflow obstruction of asthma. In order to develop a model to study IgE-mediated vascular permeability in lung, rats were passively sensitized with a murine monoclonal IgE-anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP). Forty-eight hours later, the animals were challenged intravenously with mouse serum albumin conjugated to DNP (1 to 25 micrograms) and received 125I-labeled bovine albumin at the same time to permit assessment of leakage of vascular proteins into the lungs. The animals became cyanotic, but they did not die. Control animals were challenged with mouse serum albumin alone and experienced no systemic reactions. The trachea, the hilum, and peripheral lung were removed and the radioactivity determined. Compared to control animals, vascular permeability was increased most impressively in the trachea and to a lesser extent in the hilum. No increased vascular permeability was found in the peripheral lung. In dose-response experiments (1 to 25 micrograms MSA-DNP injected), the peak effect in the trachea occurred at 25 micrograms MSA-DNP (+450 +/- 119% above control values, p less than or equal to 0.05), while the response in the bronchus was less dose dependent; maximal increase above control was at 12.5 micrograms DNP-MSA (+50 +/- 8%, p less than or equal to 0.05). The increased plasma exudation in the trachea and bronchi peaked within 5 min of antigen challenge and remained significantly increased for at least 2 h. After 8 h, no increased radioactivity could be observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Right heart catheterization showed pulmonary hypertension, and there was no clinical evidence of left ventricular failure.

Mean main-stem bronchial diameters before and after treatment were 1.1 +/- 1.3 and 9.0 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively (p less than 0.05). In the three patients with underlying emphysema, MEFV curves showed a diffuse intrathoracic obstructive pattern before and after treatment; in the other eight patients, MEFV curves demonstrated an apparently restrictive pattern, with associated airflow obstruction in four, reversible after laser treatment in three of these four. After treatment, all patients exhibited an increase in FVC with a roughly parallel shift of the MEFV curve and little change in the slope of the descending limb of the MEFV curve: FVC improved from 54 +/- 16 to 86 +/- 13% predicted in patients without emphysema and from 54 +/- 16 to 77 +/- 8% predicted in patients with emphysema, whereas the slope of the descending limb of the MEFV curve between 45 and 55% of FVC changed minimally from 2.0 +/- 0.6 to 1.8 +/- 0.5 s-1 in patients without emphysema and from 0.8 +/- 0.3 to 0.8 +/- 0.1 s-1 in patients with emphysema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used simple linear regression for adults 25 through 80 yr of age. On the basis of exploratory analyses, we excluded adult subjects who were obese, defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater. This report describes these regressions. We did not perform regression analysis for those subjects between 19 and 24 yr of age because of small numbers and the inappropriateness of grouping these subjects with older adults for regression analysis. As an alternative to a regression equation for this age group specifically, we propose linear interpolation between values obtained using prediction equations developed for children and for adults. Finally, we compared the percent predicted values obtained from our internal prediction equations with equations from other populations of white children and adults. In general, the comparison equations underestimated the percent predicted values in our population.\r"

Of a cohort of 6,346 men, 1,490 were identified as healthy asymptomatic nonsmokers. Prediction equations and reference values were derived from this subgroup. When the prediction equation was compared with those derived from Caucasian and black populations, mean predicted FEV1 for Japanese-Americans was intermediate to higher values for Caucasians and lower values for blacks. In addition to age and height, skinfolds, dynamometry, and biacromial diameter were found to be independent predictors of FEV1. In summary, standards derived from Japanese-American populations should be used when measuring pulmonary function in this group and additional physical measurements make a small contribution to the accuracy of prediction equations.\r"

These variables included skinfold thickness, dynamometry, hematocrit, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure.

The inclusion of sitting height explained part of this reduction. Controlling for lung size using FVC as a surrogate, the performance of blacks on other spirometry measures was equal to whites in all age groups. Males tended to outperform females with the same anthropometric characteristics before the inclusion of FVC as a predictor variable. However, after controlling for lung size (FVC), female performance exceeded that of males. The higher female performance is particularly noticeable in the later flow measures.

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that connective tissue breakdown in the human lung leading to airway obstruction and emphysema involves proteinases expressed by neutrophils and macrophages that traffic to the lungs in response to cigarette smoke. It remains unclear why only a small fraction of all cigarette smokers develop symptomatic airway obstruction. In this study, we examined indexes of inflammation and proteolytic activity in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage from young cigarette smokers and questioned whether there was any correlation between the extent of inflammation or enzymatic activity and lung function. A total of 125 apparently healthy community volunteers who currently smoked at least one pack per day were evaluated by spirometry. Seven subjects with a relatively low FEV1/FVC (% predicted) were identified and further studied by bronchoalveolar lavage. These were compared with a group of 10 smokers of similar age (mean age, 33 yr) and pack-years and higher FEV1/FVC (% predicted). Both groups showed increased accumulation of lung macrophages and neutrophils as compared to nonsmokers, but there were no differences in total cells or cellular differentials between the groups. Similarly, there were no differences in either alveolar fluid phase elastase, antielastase, and plasminogen activator (PA) activities or macrophage elastolytic activity between the groups. In contrast, there was a clear difference in macrophage plasminogen activator activity between the groups, cells from the group with a lower FEV1/FVC (% predicted) having a higher PA activity than that of macrophages from the group with higher FEV1/FVC (% predicted), i.e., 0.50 +/- 0.16 international urokinase units/10(6) cells versus 0.30 +/- 0.10 units/10(6) cells (p less than 0.0007).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Time/activity curves were recorded for 90 min by gamma camera. HIPDM lung clearance was described by two exponential components. In smokers, the mean time of the first component, 10 +/- 1.4 min (mean +/- SEM), did not significantly differ from that of nonsmokers (9.7 +/- 0.9 min), whereas the mean time of the second component (12.9 +/- 0.6 h) was longer than that of nonsmokers (6.7 +/- 0.2 h). The intercept to the ordinate of the second exponential component was significantly higher in smokers (90.3 +/- 1.5%) than in nonsmokers (80.7 +/- 1.9%). Control studies in rabbits showed that, 2 min after intravenous injection, 95% of HIPDM is taken up by the lung; time/activity curves were similar to those obtained in humans. The longer pulmonary persistence of HIPDM in smokers may reflect an increased number of cellular binding sites or may be the expression of hindered HIPDM biotransformation. The rabbit can be used as a model to further investigate HIPDM kinetics in relation to lung dysfunction.\r"

  ".U": "89075422\r", 
  ".W": "The hypothesis that neutrophils are a major mediator of acute lung injury is based in part on the results from leukocyte depletion studies in which peripheral leukopenia is induced by administration of chemotherapeutic agents or antileukocyte serum. Because of valid concerns about the specificity and multiplicity of effects these regimens have in vivo, we designed a correlative structure-function study of the impact of one depletion regimen on the intrapulmonary density of neutrophils in two groups of sheep. We gave one group of four awake sheep repeated injections of nitrogen mustard (0.4 mg/kg body weight on the ninth, sixth, and third day before the experiment) to lower circulating leukocyte counts to less than 1% of their normopenic value. The other group of four awake sheep was not treated before the experiment (normopenic sheep). On the day of the experiment, the sheep were anesthetized to measure hemodynamics and lung lymph dynamics, and to take lung tissue for morphologic examination before and during 4 h of continuous venous air embolization. Reduction of circulating leukocytes by greater than 99% of normopenic values only lowered pulmonary intravascular neutrophil density by about 80%. In baseline lung biopsies, neutrophil density in small pulmonary arteries (1 to 0.1 mm in diameter) in the nitrogen-mustard-treated sheep averaged 51 +/- 23 (+/- 1 SD) cells/mm2 of blood area versus 291 +/- 40 in the normopenic sheep. During venous air embolization, neutrophils sequestered in the pulmonary arterial microvessels of both groups (210 +/- 27 cells/mm2 of blood area in the nitrogen-mustard-treated sheep versus 1,217 +/- 49 in the normopenic sheep). Parallel increases in neutrophil density occurred in alveolar capillaries and small pulmonary veins. Neutrophils attached to the intravascular air emboli and to microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelial cell gaps were seen in about 30% (13 gaps in 48 microvessels) of the small arteries in the nitrogen mustard-treated sheep versus about 80% (38 gaps in 48 microvessels) in the normopenic sheep. Lung lymph protein clearance nearly doubled in the nitrogen mustard-treated sheep and tripled in the normopenic sheep during venous air embolization compared with the respective baseline clearance values. We suggest that methods used to deplete circulating leukocytes do not assure removal of neutrophils from the lungs; the remaining neutrophils appear capable of responding to intravascular inflammatory stimuli.\r"

  ".U": "89075423\r", 
  ".W": "There is considerable evidence suggesting that substrate (e.g., oxygen) distribution and utilization are abnormal in the setting of acute respiratory failure from the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mechanisms that may explain this anomalous relationship include: redistribution of cardiac output resulting in the nonuniform delivery of substrate to regional vascular beds; increases in flow through anatomic precapillary arteriovenous channels; increased organ metabolic demand; and direct injury to the regional microvasculature. To test these hypotheses, we used radiolabeled 15-mu microspheres to measure cardiac output, regional blood flow, total systemic shunt flow, oxygen uptake (VO2), and oxygen delivery (QO2) in dogs after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA: 30 micrograms/kg; n = 5)-induced neutrophil activation and acute lung injury. These studies demonstrated that neutrophil activation and acute lung injury was accompanied by an increase in the level of QO2 (e.g., 19.1 ml/min.kg) necessary to maintain a constant level of VO2. Although PMA-induced acute lung injury did not result in an increase in the fraction of cardiac output comprising total systemic shunt flow or in an increase in whole body metabolic demand compared to control animals (e.g., PMA = 0 micrograms/kg; n = 10), it did result in a significant decrease in cardiac output. In addition, there were significant reductions in blood flow to most organs after PMA-induced acute lung injury that were not reversible with intravascular volume expansion (80 ml isotonic saline/kg; n = 5). The exclusion of reversible volume depletion, anatomic shunts, and increased metabolic demand suggest a role for microvascular injury in the development of the regional blood flow abnormalities and the supply dependence of oxygen uptake observed in this study. In the context of the mechanisms of lung injury known to be operative in this model, these microcirculatory abnormalities may be mediated through the intravascular activation of circulating neutrophils.\r"

In a preliminary experiment, total lung nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) and GSH levels were measured at various times after single doses of BSO. The lowest concentrations were observed at 12 to 18 h. These experiments were used to establish a repeated dosing protocol for more prolonged GSH depletion. The lungs of rats treated with BSO for 4 days demonstrated markedly decreased GSH and NPSH levels (10 to 40% of control values) and glutathione peroxidase activity (45 to 60% of control values). Superoxide dismutase activities were elevated, glutathione reductase activity was slightly elevated, and catalase activity was unchanged. These changes were dose-responsive. The lungs of treated rats were grossly and microscopically normal. BSO treatment of additional rats did not increase susceptibility to lethal hyperoxia (greater than 98% oxygen). Combined treatment of rats with both BSO and sublethal hyperoxia (80% oxygen) for 4 days did not alter the biochemical responses demonstrated by rats treated solely with BSO. The marked increase in catalase activity obtained after hyperoxia alone was not observed in rats treated with both hyperoxia and BSO. The lungs of saline- and BSO-treated rats exposed to sublethal hyperoxia demonstrated a patchy distribution of slight perivascular and peribronchiolar edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This additive effect could be due to different modes of action or different distributions of drug. In order to investigate the additive effect of S and A when administered by the same route, we studied eight patients 63.4 +/- 1.84 yr of age (mean +/- SEM), with long-standing COPD (FEV1, 0.96 +/- 0.12 L) by giving them intravenous A and S. A double-blind, cross-over study was performed on two separate days by administering either A followed by S or vice versa. Each drug when given alone increased the FEV1 significantly (p less than 0.01). The mean increase was 0.17 +/- 0.06 L (18% of baseline) for S and 0.15 +/- 0.05 L (17% of baseline) for A. The FEV1 increased 0.07 +/- 0.02 L when S was added to A (95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.12, 7% of baseline), and when A was added to S 0.05 +/- 0.03 L (95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.12, 6% of baseline). Neither change was significant. Heart rate (HR) was increased significantly (p less than 0.01) by S (22 +/- 3.4%), but not by A when it was given first. However, addition of the second drug increased HR significantly (p less than 0.01) from HR with one drug alone; the mean increase was 31 +/- 8.5% of baseline with the addition of S, and 19 +/- 4.06% of baseline with the addition of A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies examining the effects of hypoxia on diaphragm function have reached conflicting conclusions, with some reports suggesting an adverse effect of even mild hypoxemia while others indicate that the diaphragm may be extremely resistant to hypoxic stress. Diaphragm tension was not, however, directly measured nor was diaphragm length controlled in these previous reports, and it seems possible that methodologic limitations may have been responsible for these discrepant results. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of graded, steady-state hypoxia on diaphragm blood flow, oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption, and contractility using an in situ canine diaphragm strip preparation that permitted direct and continuous measurement of diaphragm length, tension, and blood flow. Measurements were made with the diaphragm at rest, during normoxia (PaO2, 90 to 160 mm Hg), mild hypoxia (PaO2, 45 to 60 mm Hg), and severe hypoxia (PaO2, 25 to 35 mm Hg); measurements were made with the diaphragm at rest, during rhythmic contractions at a tension time index (TTI) of 0.05, and with contractions at a TTI of 0.15. Decreases in arterial oxygenation resulted in progressive increases in blood flow and in the fractional extraction of oxygen in both resting and contracting diaphragm strips. At all levels of activity tested, blood flow and fractional extraction increased sufficiently to keep diaphragm oxygen consumption constant despite reductions in arterial oxygen content. Diaphragm contractility, as assessed from the tension generated in response to a range of electrical stimuli (1 to 80 Hz), was unaffected by hypoxia for trials performed with the diaphragm at rest and contracting at a TTI of 0.05.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the specific site of inspiratory narrowing within the upper airway during sleep, we measured supralaryngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal pressures and inspiratory flow in 11 healthy nonsnoring male subjects awake and in NREM sleep. Resistance was calculated at 0.01 L/s, a point along the linear portion of the pressure-flow relationship, and at peak inspiratory pressure, a point within the curvilinear section of the pressure-flow relationship. During sleep, nasal resistance increased minimally. At peak inspiratory pressure, both transpalatal and hypopharyngeal resistances increased more than 700% in NREM sleep. At 0.01 L/s inspiratory flow, transpalatal and hypopharyngeal resistances increased 200 and 400%, respectively. Six subjects had a greater increase in transpalatal than hypopharyngeal resistance, and five subjects had a greater increase in hypopharyngeal than transpalatal resistance. Three subjects in each of these two subgroups had an increase in resistance exclusively across the palate or the hypopharynx. The site of increased resistance during sleep was not predictable from awake resistance measurements. From these data, we conclude that the site of inspiratory narrowing within the upper airway during sleep occurs primarily at either the level of the palate or hypopharynx and is variable among subjects. The pattern of palatal or hypopharyngeal narrowing is the same as that observed in obstructive sleep apnea patients, but quantitatively different.\r"

The stimulation was produced by a cytology brush passed through a bronchoscope previously introduced transnasally and positioned just above the epiglottis. The subjects were premedicated with cholinergic blockers, and bronchoconstriction was induced by inhalation of histamine. In 11 experiments performed on six patients, vocal cords stimulation resulted in a decreased RL from 8.4 +/- 1.0 to 6.3 +/- 0.8 cm H2O.L-1.s (mean +/- SE) (p less than 0.01). To assess the possible contribution of circulating catecholamines to this decrease, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured in six experiments, before and 30 s, 1, 3, and 5 min after the stimulation. Pulmonary resistance fell from 10.0 +/- 1.3 to 7.6 +/- 0.9 cm H2O.L-1.s (mean +/- SE) (p less than 0.05) 30 s and to 7.9 +/- 0.9 cm H2O.L-1.s (p less than 0.05) 60 s after stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine levels increased slightly but not significantly throughout the experiment. We conclude that in asthmatic patients, as in normal subjects, stimulation of the vocal cords produces a reflex decrease in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction which is modulated by the nonadrenergic noncholinergic nervous system.\r"

Each inspired air condition produced significant airway cooling in both groups. Cold air evoked the greatest response, followed thereafter by hot dry and then room air. Only the asthmatic subjects developed airway obstruction. These data demonstrate that hot dry gases facilitate evaporative cooling and do not keep the airways warm as has been previously suggested. It appears the airway cooling is a normal part of respiration and develops whenever air is inhaled that requires the transfer of heat and/or water to bring the inspirate to body conditions.\r"

We studied 19 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 3 subjects with chronic intermittent rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sneezing without any other manifestation of allergy. We found that the change in nasal resistance and symptoms caused by nasal inhalation of 4 ppm of SO2 for 10 min was no greater than the changes caused by nasal inhalation of conditioned room air. In a second set of experiments, we examined whether allergic subjects with demonstrable bronchomotor responsiveness to SO2 also had nasal responsiveness to the gas. We studied 8 subjects with a history of both asthma and allergic rhinitis. Each subject developed symptoms of dyspnea or wheezing and an increase in specific airway resistance of at least 8 L x cm H2O/L/s after breathing 1 or 2 ppm of SO2 by mouthpiece at 20 L/min, and did not develop these changes after breathing room air under the same conditions. No subject, however, developed more nasal symptoms or a greater increase in nasal airway resistance after tidally breathing SO2 through the nose than after breathing room air, even when the concentration of SO2 delivered to the nose was double the concentration delivered through the mouthpiece to the lower airways. We conclude that brief exposure to SO2 at a concentration of 4 ppm or less is unlikely to cause significant nasal dysfunction in most subjects with chronic rhinitis, and that in subjects with both allergic rhinitis and asthma, responsiveness to SO2 is not uniform throughout the respiratory tract.\r"

Guinea pigs were actively sensitized with 10 micrograms of either ovalbumin or Dermatophagoides farinae extract in AI(OH)3 injected intraperitoneally twice at a 2-wk interval. Seven days after the second injection (booster injection), the lungs were removed, ventilated, and perfused via the pulmonary artery with Krebs solution containing 2.5 g/L bovine serum albumin. In lungs from actively sensitized animals, BC was induced by significantly lower doses of PAF-acether and LTD4 than those required to elicit the same response in control preparations. In addition, sensitized lungs released more TxB2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and histamine in response to PAF-acether and LTD4 than did control lungs. Increased mediator release was also observed upon challenge of lungs from actively sensitized animals with arachidonic acid and histamine. Lungs from guinea pigs passively sensitized with serum from actively sensitized animals did not exhibit increased responsiveness to PAF-acether as compared to control lungs. The hyperresponsiveness induced after booster injection of the antigen occurred concomitantly with an increase in the homocytotropic antibody titer (as measured by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) and persisted for 3 months after sensitization, when the levels of circulating antibodies and lung response to antigen challenge returned to control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tracheal diameter and chest dimensions were measured from postero-anterior chest radiographs in grain handlers to prospectively identify airway size and chest size-related predictors of the rate of pulmonary function decline. A total of 634 grain workers were studied at the initial survey, of whom 239 satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) had a satisfactory chest radiograph taken at the initial survey in 1975, (2) performed spirometry at the 1975, 1978, and 1981 surveys, and (3) had no change in smoking status from 1975 to 1981. Radiographic measurements consisted of height of the right lung, transverse diameter of the chest at the level of the right diaphragm and at a level two-thirds up the right lung, and tracheal diameter (Tr). Areas of both lungs were measured by planimetry. Tr was only weakly related to height (r = 0.24). Increasing age was strongly associated with faster rates of FEV1 decline. After adjusting for the effects of age and cigarette smoking, Tr was the only radiographic measurement associated with FEV1 decline. Workers with Tr of 16 mm or less lost an average of 0.2% of their FEV1 per year compared to 0.9% per year for those with larger tracheas. This association was not modified by dust exposure estimates based on measurements of total dust. However, the strength of the association did depend upon smoking status, being strongest in current cigarette smokers (Tr less than or equal to 16 mm lost 0.2% annually and Tr greater than or equal to 21 mm lost 1.4% annually).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the release of the monokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) from blood monocytes in a group of 66 coal miners and 12 non-dust-exposed individuals. Twenty-seven miners had simple Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP). Control miners (n = 39) were matched with respect to age, years underground, and smoking. Monocytes were assayed for TNF release, spontaneously or in response to soluble (endotoxin) or particulate (coal mine dust, silica) stimulation. TNF was measured with a TNF-specific ELISA. Monocytes of all subjects responded to stimulants by the release of TNF. Dust-exposed controls' monocytes revealed higher TNF release as compared to normal controls. The greatest discriminator between control miners and cases (CWP) was coal mine dust-induced TNF release. Interestingly, the largest difference was observed between controls and those cases with a small number of opacities (0/1, 1/0, 1/1, and 1/2), giving an odds ratio of 6.3 to find an individual with a \"high\" dust-induced TNF release in the patient group.\r"

Sarcoidosis patients with Stage 3 chest radiographs had significantly greater BAL histamine than did sarcoidosis patients with radiographic Stages 0, 1, or 2. Sarcoidosis patients with higher BAL lymphocytes also had higher levels of BAL histamine. Furthermore, among the sarcoidosis patients, we found a marked interactive effect between higher BAL lymphocytes and Stage 3 radiographs on BAL histamine. In IPF, subjects with increased BAL lymphocytes had significantly less BAL histamine than subjects with normal levels of lymphocytes. These studies suggest that BAL histamine may be a useful marker (of more active disease and/or poorer prognosis) to be evaluated in prospective studies in patients with sarcoidosis and IPF.\r"

The aim of this study was to verify whether, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, immunologic pulmonary abnormalities set the stage for the lung complications. For this purpose, a phenotypic and functional characterization of lymphocytes recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 24 patients with clinical symptoms and signs of HIV infections was performed (six patients with constitutional disease, five patients with neurologic manifestations, and 13 patients with full-blown AIDS). Our data showed that (1) in patients with HIV, the percentage and absolute number of pulmonary CD8 cells were significantly increased over those in control subjects (in 25% of these patients, mostly with full-blown AIDS, CD8 cells sustained an alveolitis); (2) lung CD4 cells were reduced in percentage but not in absolute number, with the exception of patients with AIDS in whom a significant decrease of the absolute number of BAL CD4 cells has been found (further phenotypic analysis of CD4 lymphocytes showed a reduction of the expression of T4A, B, and E with respect to the T4, T4C, T4D, and T4F epitopes); (3) although the number of BAL cells bearing NK-related determinants was increased, we were unable to demonstrate any in vitro natural killer cell activity. We suggest that the impairment of a proper NK activity in the lungs of these patients might be central to the mechanisms leading to the in situ immunodeficiency state and to the pulmonary complications characterizing AIDS.\r"

Hydration of the airway surface appears to promote effective mucociliary clearance and to influence the rheology of mucins, and together these factors provide a major mechanism for airway defense. The cellular processes governing absorption and secretion of salt are similar, if not identical, to those that have been described in a variety of other absorptive and secretory epithelial cells where they may be studied in isolation. A better molecular understanding of the channels that control apical membrane transport of Na and Cl, the rate-determining steps in salt absorption and secretion, should enhance our basic understanding of the factors that control the quantity and composition of airway fluids. This may elucidate the mechanisms for the reciprocal control of apical Na and Cl channel activities and provide an explanation for the balance between these oppositely directed salt transport processes.\r"

During inflammation, mast cells may arise in situ as well as by infiltration because epithelium contains both mast cell precursors and produces factors that support their growth in vitro. Structural studies show that mast cells associate with nerves in the lung. Using a tissue culture model, we showed that sympathetic nerves formed lasting contacts with rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Electrophysiologic studies showed that nerve contact increases RBL membrane conductance, which can be mimicked by exogenous substance P (SP). Experiments with sensitized rat tracheal mucosa in Ussing chambers showed functional evidence of interaction of mast cells with SP-containing nerves: changes in short circuit current caused by antigen were blocked by the mast cell stabilizer doxantrazole and reduced by 50% by neonatal pretreatment with capsaicin. Experiments in vivo showed that lung clearance of the aerosol probe 99mTc-DTPA was increased by antigen challenge in sensitized rats. This was blocked by neonatal capsaicin treatment, again implicating SP-containing nerves. Therefore, we conclude that the functional association of mast cells with nerves is an important mechanism in regulating the local epithelial environment.\r"

  ".U": "89075461\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary epithelial cells may be primarily responsible for initiating or regulating inflammatory responses in the airways, in part by releasing chemical mediators. Among the most potent mediators of inflammation are the lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, including the leukotrienes and the other mono- and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). The human airway epithelium contains significant 15-lipoxygenase activity. Although some biologic functions of 15-lipoxygenase metabolites are known, further understanding of the role of this enzyme in the airway requires localization in tissue and studies of expression, regulation, and biologic activity. Towards these aims, we purified and characterized 15-lipoxygenase from eosinophil-enriched leukocytes. First, we studied cofactors that may be involved in regulating enzymatic activity. We discovered that calcium and phosphatidylcholine both enhanced, but ATP inhibited, the 15-lipoxygenase activity of highly enriched enzyme. Second, we isolated to homeogeneity, for the first time, human 15-lipoxygenase. This led to the determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the discovery of homology among various mammalian lipoxygenases. Further research using purified lipoxygenase is expected to increase our understanding of the biologic roles and biochemical features of 15-lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid.\r"

These changes may predominantly affect ciliary function alone or be associated with epithelial disruption and cell death. Some factors act immediately, while others can take up to a number of days to achieve effect. It is postulated that rapidly acting factors may be involved during bacterial colonization, allowing the bacterium time (by slowing clearance) to penetrate the mucociliary barrier and reach putative receptors on the epithelial surface. The compounds might similarly facilitate contiguous spread through the bronchial tree and augment the tissue damage caused by the host inflammatory response during chronic bronchial sepsis. Future work should define more clearly the in vivo significance of the largely in vitro observations made to date.\r"

The protection towards the adverse actions of the eosinophil, particularly towards their proteins, therefore seems vital.

The current classification identifies at least four major syndrome groups or types. It also recognizes a considerable number of additional syndromes that may represent supplementary types or subgroups. Loss of hearing is the least constant of the prominent features of OI. Its incidence varies between 26% and 60%. In OI, formation and remodelling of bone are variously affected. In the temporal bone the development of the inner ear capsule may be involved severely. In the stapes the disturbance in lamellar bone formation can lead to extreme thinness, dehiscence, and nonunion of the stapedial superstructure with the footplate. Osteogenesis imperfecta can be associated with otosclerosis, another bone dysplasia with a different morphology. Otosclerosis, in turn, may interfere with sound conduction and perception. Thus, the hearing loss encountered in OI may be the result of OI, otosclerosis, or a combination of both.\r"

Retrospective chart review was performed to determine estimated blood loss and operative time, and illustrative case reports are presented. The technique of preoperative SSE represents an important advance in the surgical management of glomus jugulare tumors. In our experience, surgical ligation of tumor-feeding vessels or nonselective embolization of the external carotid system is unsatisfactory. Inadequate devascularization and excessive risk of complications have caused us and others to abandon these procedures. However, SSE performed by an experienced neuroradiologist can produce effective and safer tumor devascularization. Preoperative SSE results in shrinkage of tumor size and significantly decreases blood loss. The advantages to the surgeon include improved visualization and ease of dissection as well as increased confidence that complete tumor excision has been achieved.\r"

Fine-cut computed tomograms were evaluated, and it was determined that measurements taken from such scans can define the anatomy of individual temporal bones. We conclude that hearing conservation surgery for acoustic neuroma is a relatively difficult surgical exercise and that complete familiarity with the anatomy and use of all available landmarks is required for successful tumor removal and hearing conservation. Success can be improved further by using measurements taken from the individual patient's preoperative CT scan.\r"

However, indicators of intact auditory brain stem response (waves I-III-V), good speech discrimination score, and intact acoustic (stapedial) reflex were associated with a 68.2% rate of success. Thus, a comprehensive audiologic evaluation is a guideline for selecting and counselling patients with acoustic tumors before hearing preservation procedures.\r"

The most frequent diagnoses were otitis externa, acute otitis media, and otitis media with effusion. Sensorineural hearing loss frequently appeared to be related to ototoxic medications and neurologic infections.\r"

Facial nerve monitoring was used in all cases and there were no instances of facial nerve injury. Postoperatively, two thirds of the patients had speech reception thresholds of 30 dB or better; the air conduction threshold (averaged for 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz) improved at least 25 dB in 80% of the patients and at least 30 dB in 60% of the patients (follow-up, 10 to 29 months). Minor revision surgery was necessary in three patients. On the basis of this series, several conclusions were made. First, one of the most important factors in proper patient selection is the degree of middle ear development on computed tomography, both in terms of size and ossicular formation. Second, every attempt should be made to keep the ossicular chain intact (versus use of a prosthesis), as this appears to optimize hearing results. Third, embryologic considerations and surgical experience predict a mobile stapes in the majority of major atresias. Lastly, facial nerve abnormalities are to be expected, especially in patients with significant microtia, but facial nerve monitoring will help minimize the risk of facial nerve injury.\r"

Evidence of osteoclastic bone resorption was found in surgical specimens of 11 of 24 cases of cholesteatoma, two of three cases of chronic otitis media, and three of ten cases of otosclerotic stapes; all three spongiotic lesions had osteoclasts. With careful serial sectioning these cells are almost always multinucleate and have the typical appearance of osteoclasts with ruffled borders. Some specimens had evidence of bone erosion in the absence of osteoclasts; this finding represents an inactive phase of the remodeling process. Since the osteoclast plays an important role in the resorption and remodeling of bone in these middle ear diseases, the source, physiology, and local control of these cells are of prime importance in investigating the pathophysiology of these diseases. At the present time, the local control of activation and recruitment of osteoclasts, as well as their chemotactic responses, is poorly understood.\r"

A much greater than expected incidence of eventual cholesteatoma recurrence suggests that even with staging, closed techniques may provide a less than reliable outcome in surgical control of the disease, and long-term observation of ears thus treated is desirable.\r"

In this study, we determined the general morphological characteristics of the human adrenal medulla and assessed factors important for the maintenance of cultured chromaffin cells for later use as transplants. The human adrenal medulla contained islands of cortical cells scattered throughout the gland as well as Schwann cells, nerve endings, endothelial cells, pericytes, isolated ganglionic neurons, and connective tissue elements such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Because many of these cell types are mitotically active, transplantation of medullary fragments that contain these cells could have far-reaching consequences. One approach that could circumvent the problems arising from multiple cell types in the medulla is differential plating of chromaffin cells prior to transplantation. Differential plating yielded relatively pure populations of chromaffin cells that demonstrated excellent viability if processed within 2 hours after cessation of the gland's circulation. Chromaffin cells cultured in the presence of nerve growth factor exhibited a neuronal phenotype, possessed catecholamine histofluorescence, and displayed tyrosine hydroxylase- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity. The sex and age of the donor did not affect cell viability or morphological characteristics.\r"

This task requires a subject to emit a simple motor response to one cue while inhibiting the response in the presence of another cue. Commission errors suggest impulsivity, and omission errors suggest inattention. ADD subjects made more total errors than did control subjects (p less than 0.03), and more ADD subjects made multiple errors (p less than 0.001). Within the ADD group, the nonhyperactive (ADDnoH) subjects were characterized by a high number of commission errors early, and significant improvement with practice (p less than 0.01). In contrast, the hyperactive ADD subjects (ADD/H) did not differ from control subjects in number of early commission errors, but differed from both control subjects and ADDnoH subjects in their failure to improve with practice. In addition, the incidence of omission errors was highest in the ADD/H group. This paradigm can be easily incorporated into the assessment of children with suspected ADD and provides an objective measure of inattention and impulsivity. Our data provide cognitive support for the empirical distinction between hyperactive and nonhyperactive children with ADD.\r"

Electron microscopic studies on one patient revealed microvasculitis; frequent tubuloreticular inclusions in endothelial cells, histiocytes, and lymphocytes; and cylindrical confronting cisternae in lymphocytes.

Each histochemical procedure localized a well-delineated, compact lateral group and a more diffuse medial group of neurons within the pedunculopontine nucleus. Co-localization experiments revealed that all three enzymes marked the same population of cholinergic neurons. The extent of pathological alterations associated with the cholinergic neurons within the compact lateral sector of the pedunculopontine nucleus was examined in sections that reacted for NADPH-d, counterstained with thioflavin-S. The average number of neurofibrillary tangles within this portion of the pedunculopontine nucleus was 25.4 (range 0-70) in patients with AD, 1.5 (range 1-2) in those with PD, and 1.2 (range 0-4) in aged control subjects. Of the total number of neurofibrillary tangles counted in AD cases, 72.7% were end-stage ghosts and 27.3% were tangle-bearing neurons. The pathological alteration of cholinergic neurons of the compact lateral aspect of the pedunculopontine nucleus may play a role in some of the behavioral features characteristic of AD.\r"

Few significant (p less than 0.05) differences existed between exposed and unexposed subjects. However, multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated several significant correlations between declining neurological function and increasing exposure as determined by urine mercury measurements from the exposure interval. Subjects with urine mercury peak levels above 0.6 mg/L demonstrated significantly decreased strength, decreased coordination, increased tremor, decreased sensation, and increased prevalence of Babinski and snout reflexes when compared with the remaining subjects. Furthermore, subjects with clinical polyneuropathy had significantly higher peak levels than normal subjects (0.85 vs 0.61 mg/L; p = 0.04), but not increased exposure duration (20.1 vs 20.8 quarters; p = 0.34), and 28% of subjects with peak levels above 0.85 mg/L had clinical evidence of polyneuropathy, compared with 10% of remaining subjects (p = 0.005). Although exposure was not age dependent, several neurological measures showed significant age-mercury interaction, suggesting that natural neuronal attrition may unmask prior exposure-related subclinical abnormalities.\r"

Young normal subjects were also studied both before and after intake of a dopamine antagonist (haloperidol). Compensatory gastrocnemius electromyographic responses resulting from backward-directed displacements were significantly smaller in both the patients and the young normal subjects following intake of haloperidol. The reduced sensitivity of the gastrocnemius muscle to stretch correlated with an inability to compensate for the perturbations. In the patients, the gastrocnemius response was followed by enhanced activation of the tibialis anterior muscle. This was not the case in the normal subjects after intake of dopamine antagonist and is probably not, therefore, the consequence of acute dopamine deficiency. In the patients the angular rotation at the ankle joint induced during faster backward-directed displacements was slower than that in normal subjects, despite identical amounts of gastrocnemius electromyographic activity. This supports earlier findings of changes in intrinsic muscle stiffness in Parkinson's disease. None of these differences were seen when the tibialis anterior muscle was stretched. This differential behavior of the antagonist leg muscles can best be explained by the different function fulfilled by these muscles in regulation of stance and gait.\r"

Activity of the dopamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, and concentrations of dopamine and its primary metabolite homovanillic acid were significantly greater than anticipated on the basis of previously published postmortem values. These data suggest that postmortem changes in various biochemical parameters of dopamine function are more rapid than has been generally appreciated. Further analysis of striatal biopsy samples may reveal predictive relationships between striatal indices of dopamine function and therapeutic response to adrenal transplantation.\r"

In six of the 72 radiologically scarred kidneys, the DMSA scan appeared normal but scarring would have been overlooked in only two of the 54 patients. DMSA scan changes are non-specific and underestimated individual scars in 21 kidneys. The intravenous urogram and the DMSA scan showed good correlation but should be regarded as complementary investigations in these patients, giving morphological and functional information, respectively. On DMSA scans the timing of any preceding urinary tract infection must be considered in order to differentiate diffuse potentially reversible defects in isotope uptake after urinary tract infection from those due to permanent renal scarring.\r"

Infants with trivial symptoms had gastro-oesophageal reflux synchronous with swallowing, whereas those with serious symptoms had slower acid clearance and asynchronous reflux. There were significant differences in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and amplitude of oesophageal contractions between controls and patients with both gastro-oesophageal reflux and reflux oesophagitis. In reflux oesophagitis there was a decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and the contractions had a bizarre waveform suggesting a neuropathic process.\r"

We applied this technique in children to describe the maturation of corticospinal tracts. The latency from cortical stimulation to the onset of the evoked muscle action potentials and the subject's height were recorded. The subject's height was divided by the latency to the onset of the evoked muscle action potential to provide an index of the conduction velocity within descending motor pathways (VI). It is possible to evoke muscle action potentials after electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in children including preterm babies and there is a stepwise increase in the sensitivity to stimulation between 8 and 11 years of age. In addition there is a progressive increase in VI with age; adult values are attained at about 11 years. The successful application of this technique in children suggests that electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex has the potential to allow detection of abnormality in motor pathways in newborn babies and young children.\r"

Abnormal evoked potentials were recorded in 10 of the 11 children whose blood glucose concentration fell below 2.6 mmol/l; five of these 10 children were 'asymptomatic'. No change in evoked potentials was recorded in the six children whose blood glucose concentration remained above 2.6 mmol/l. Our findings suggest that the blood glucose concentration should be maintained above 2.6 mmol/l to ensure normal neural function in children irrespective of the presence or absence of abnormal clinical signs.\r"

Serum thyroxine and the dose of L-thyroxine/kg/body weight were significantly lower in those infants with raised thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations. Thyroid stimulating hormone was appropriately suppressed when the dose of L-thyroxine was increased, and only one child had delayed maturation of the hypothalamic/pituitary/thyroid axis. We believe it is the infant's rapid gain in weight in the first two years of life that necessitates this decrease in the dose of L-thyroxine/kg body weight and recommend that the treatment of this age group is reviewed every two to three months.\r"

Testosterone and four precursor steroids were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after incubation of the cell preparations with 100 microM of pregnenolone and appropriate concentrations of ethanol (1-100 mM). Concentrations of all 4-ene-steroids measured were significantly decreased even at the lowest concentration of ethanol. When NAD+ (0.1 mM) was added to the incubation medium, the levels of progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone returned to control values, whereas those of androstenedione and testosterone remained decreased. These results suggest that ethanol may inhibit testicular steroidogenesis by suppressing at least two steps in the pregnenolone-to-testosterone pathway, the pregnenolone-to-progesterone step catalysed by NAD+-dependent 5-ene-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase and the 17-hydroxy-progesterone-to-androstenedione step catalysed by the NAD+-independent C17-20 lyase.\r"

Heart rate (HR) increased by 12% and cardiac output (CO) by 24% 1 hour after alcohol ingestion (mean serum ethanol 35 mmol/l). Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) decreased by 5% because of endsystolic dilation and the forearm blood flow increased by 140%. Eight hours after alcohol ingestion (serum ethanol 21 mmol/l.) hangover symptoms were present in all subjects. HR and CO remained increased by 19% and 23%, respectively. A 4% increase was recorded in LVEF. The total peripheral resistance was reduced by 25%, while the forearm blood flow had returned to baseline values. No significant changes in plasma catecholamines were recorded. Apart from a slight increase in CO at 1 hour no haemodynamic changes were recorded after ingestion of an isovolumic, isocaloric drink. The present findings suggest that acute alcohol intoxication causes impairment of LV contractility, but that tachycardia results in an increase in cardiac output accompanied by an increased blood flow in the forearm. In the early hangover phase, when the serum ethanol is still elevated, cardiac output remains enhanced because of tachycardia, although the sympathetic nervous activity as measured by the plasma norepinephrine level is not influenced. A reduced total peripheral resistance may contribute to the increase in LV contractility in spite of sustained alcohol intoxication.\r"

(2) After 6 weeks ethanol feeding, significant reductions in body weight (approx. 15%) occurred in both groups of rats. In immature rats there were significant reductions (7-21%) in bone, gastrocnemius, liver, and skin weights. The total skeletal muscle mass was reduced by 20%. Lung and kidney weights were not significantly altered. In mature rats smaller decreases in organ weights were found, which were only significant for skeletal muscle and skin. The gastrocnemius protein content was significantly reduced in immature but not in mature rats. Plasma protein concentrations were unaltered in both groups. (3) Plasma aspartate aminotransaminase, gamma glutamyl transferase and creatine kinase activities in immature and mature rats were not significantly altered by ethanol feeding, but there were increases in plasma alkaline phosphatase activities in immature, but not in mature, rats. Plasma glucose was slightly raised by ethanol feeding in immature but not mature rats. Plasma triglycerides and insulin were unaltered in both groups of rats. (4) Protein synthesis was measured with a flooding dose of L[4(3)H]-phenylalanine. Rates of protein breakdown were calculated from the difference between synthesis and growth. Fractional and absolute rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis were reduced by 13-30% by ethanol treatment, in immature and mature rats. Fractional rates of protein breakdown were also reduced by ethanol, by 13 and 19% in immature and mature rats, respectively.\r"

These two groups were not comparable. The results were considered significant enough to justify further study. Two thirds of a group of workers referred to hospital for alcohol tests on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol had alcohol levels exceeding 35.2 mmol/l. It is concluded that there is a range of significant blood alcohol levels where employees are at increased risk of accidents but have a limited chance of detection by their supervisor and that this circumstance justifies the use of random testing particularly of employees responsible for the safety of others.\r"

Patients with unstable angina had had symptoms for a shorter time and were more likely to have angiographically complex lesions and lesions less than 10 mm in length than patients with chronic stable angina. Other baseline variables were not significantly different in the two groups. The overall primary success rate was similar in both groups (87% v 86%). Nine of the 14 unsuccessful procedures in those with unstable angina and nine of the 24 unsuccessful procedures in those with stable angina were the result of acute occlusion. These results led to a 9% frequency of procedure related myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina and a 5% rate in those with stable angina (NS). The procedure related infarct rate tended to be higher in patients with unstable angina who had coronary angioplasty soon after an episode of unstable angina (mean 10 days) than in those in whom it was delayed (mean 35 days) (12% v 3%) (NS). In patients with unstable angina who had had a previous myocardial infarction procedure related infarction was significantly more common (18%) than in patients with no previous myocardial infarction (3%). The difference between those with and without previous infarction was also significant in patients with stable angina (10% v 3%).\r"

Of 302 consecutive stable survivors of infarction, 262 performed a predischarge submaximal exercise test. In the first year after infarction patients with a \"positive\" exercise test were 13 times more likely to die, 2.8 times more likely to have an ischaemic event, and 2.3 times more likely to develop left ventricular failure than patients with negative tests. Patients with positive exercise tests underwent cardiac catheterization. Features of the history, 12 lead electrocardiogram, in-hospital clinical course, exercise test, and left ventricular and coronary angiograms that predicted these clinical end points were identified by univariate analysis. Then multivariable analysis was used to assess the relative powers of all variables in predicting end points. Certain features of the exercise test remained independent predictors of future ischaemic events and the development of overt left ventricular failure, but clinical and angiographic variables were more powerful predictors of mortality. Because the exercise test is also used to select patients for angiography, however, the results of this study strongly support the use of early submaximal exercise testing after infarction.\r"

Two thirds of the patients had raised age-corrected values of fasting serum cholesterol and/or triglyceride and/or a low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with the controls. Eighteen (30%) of the 61 normolipidaemic patients had a concentration of serum apolipoprotein A-I below the 5th percentile of 233 controls. In normolipidaemic patients on beta blockers the relative prevalence of serum low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apolipoprotein B values above the 95th percentile of 339 controls was significantly increased. Discriminant function analysis showed that a raised concentration of serum triglyceride was the best discriminant between patients and controls, with raised LDL-apolipoprotein B and reduced apolipoprotein A-I coming second only to triglyceride in analyses where each was separately compared with all the lipid variables. These associations were highly significant and were independent of other influences, including beta blockade. These findings re-emphasise the importance of hypertriglyceridaemia as a risk factor and confirm that apolipoprotein abnormalities occur frequently in coronary disease, even in normolipidaemic patients.\r"

Data from the initial examination in a large prospective study of cardiovascular disease in middle aged men (the British Regional Heart Study) were used to separate 7710 men into three groups on the basis of a resting electrocardiogram, a standardised chest pain questionnaire, and recall of a doctor's diagnosis of angina or of a previous heart attack: (group 1) no evidence of ischaemic heart disease (75%), (group 2) evidence of ischaemic heart disease short of a definite myocardial infarction (20%), (group 3) definite myocardial infarction (6%). In the average follow up period of 7.5 years, 443 men suffered a new major event caused by ischaemic heart disease (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death). Age standardised event rates were determined for each of the three groups for varying levels of the established risk factors. Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with the event rate in group 1 but in men with existing heart disease, especially group 3, differences in risk between the smoking categories were smaller. The strong relation between systolic blood pressure and event rate persisted in groups 1 and 2 but not in group 3. The positive association between serum concentration of total cholesterol and the event rate was strongest in group 1 and weaker in groups 2 and 3, though it remained highly significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Attenuation of counts from the more distant inferior portion of the left ventricular blood pool in equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography may mean that inferior infarction is less likely to be detected than anterior infarction. Fourier amplitude and phase images can be used to map the extent and timing of regional ventricular wall motion and this study assesses their use for the detection of anterior and inferior infarction. Normal regional values of amplitude and phase were established in 38 individuals without evidence of cardiac abnormality. In 20 patients with anterior infarcts, though the sensitivity of the combined left anterior oblique amplitude and phase images was high (95%) it was lower (77%) in 39 with inferior infarcts, principally because the sensitivity of the phase image for the detection of inferior infarcts was only 39%. Right anterior oblique images generated from a first pass study detected all 13 patients with inferior infarcts. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in the patients with anterior infarcts (37%) than in those with inferior infarcts (48%). Although the mean wall motion score on x ray contrast ventriculography was slightly lower in the patients with anterior infarction, the high sensitivity of the right anterior oblique amplitude and phase images in inferior infarction suggests that attenuation of counts is an important cause of reduced sensitivity of the left anterior oblique images. This may also partly explain the lower ejection fractions in inferior infarction. It follows that both a right anterior oblique first pass study and a left anterior oblique equilibrium study are necessary for an accurate description of regional wall motion.\r"

Patients underwent ambulatory ST segment monitoring off all routine antianginal treatment (total 6264 hours) and exercise testing (n = 146). Ninety one patients (61%) had a total of 598 episodes of significant ST segment change, of which 446 (75%) were asymptomatic. Twenty seven patients (18%) had only painless episodes; 14 (9%) patients only painful episodes; 50 patients (33%) had both painless and painful episodes. The mean number of ST segment changes per day was 2.58 (1.95 silent); however, 11 patients (7%) had 50% of all silent episodes, and 48 patients (32%) had 91% of all silent episodes. Fifty nine patients (39%) had no ST segment changes on ambulatory monitoring, and 73 patients (49%) had no evidence of silent ischaemia. Episodes of silent ischaemia occurred with a similar circadian distribution to that of painful ischaemia, predominantly between 0730 and 1930. There was a similar mean rise in heart rate at the onset of both silent and painful episodes of ischaemia. Silent ischaemia was significantly more frequent in patients with three vessel disease than in those with single vessel disease, and was also significantly related to both time to 1 mm ST depression and maximal exercise duration on exercise testing. There was a highly significant relation between the mean number and duration of episodes of silent ischaemia in patients with positive exercise tests when compared with those with negative tests. No episode of ventricular tachycardia was recorded in association with silent ischaemic change.\r"

Fifteen patients were studied: 10 were undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (upright T waves) and five aortic valve replacement (four patients with T inversion). Monophasic action potentials were recorded intraoperatively from eight to 10 left ventricular sites in each patient. In patients with upright T waves there was an inverse relation between the duration of the monophasic action potential and the activation time (mean slope -1.44). As a consequence, activation and repolarisation proceeded in opposite directions. Dispersion of repolarisation time (14 ms) was less than dispersion of activation time (23 ms). In patients with T wave inversion caused by aortic stenosis there was no relation between the duration of action potential and activation time; the repolarisation sequence resembled the activation sequence, and the dispersion of repolarisation time was greater than the dispersion of activation time (31 and 26 ms respectively). These results show that there are epicardial repolarisation gradients in man and that these are related to the configuration of the T wave. In patients with upright T waves an inverse relation between the duration of the action potential and the activation time reduces the dispersion of the repolarisation time. When the T wave was inverted this relation was no longer found and the dispersion of repolarisation increased.\r"

They exercised maximally on a bicycle ergometer and repeated the test after taking propranolol (40 mg) by mouth two hours before. Electrocardiograms were continuously recorded on magnetic tape and the cardiac cycle length (RR interval) and the QT interval were measured every five seconds by a computer aided method. The RR-QT data from each test during the exercise phase were analysed by an exponential formula, QT = A - B x exp (-k x RR) and by Bazett's formula, QT = K x square root of (RR). Three reference QT intervals, QTc1, QTc2, and QTc3, estimated at RR = 400, 700, and 1000 ms respectively from the regression curves of both formulas were compared. The exponential formula, which consistently gave a better fit with the data, showed that propranolol had a biphasic action on the QT intervals during exercise. It significantly prolonged the mean (SD) interval at longer cycle lengths (from 287 (27) to 305 (18) ms at RR = 1000 ms and shortened it at shorter cycle lengths (from 198 (14) to 179 (16) ms at RR = 400 ms). In contrast, Bazett's formula did not show any significant effect when the same raw data were used. The exponential formula can be adapted to study other interventions or conditions that affect QT intervals.\r"

The interatrial septum bulged into the left atrium during the whole cardiac cycle. Doppler echocardiography showed clinically significant tricuspid regurgitation, a right to left shunt through the foramen ovale, reduced flow through the pulmonary valve, and in two patients ductal flow into the pulmonary artery. In one patient tricuspid regurgitation was so great that it impeded the opening of the pulmonary valve and produced functional \"atresia\" of the pulmonary valve. The presence of regurgitant blood flow through the pulmonary valve showed that the \"atresia\" was functional rather than organic. Doppler echocardiographic study is useful in distinguishing functional neonatal tricuspid regurgitation from structural abnormality of the tricuspid valve.\r"

  ".W": "Androgenic stimulation of sebaceous glands is necessary for development of acne. If hyperandrogenaemia were a major determinant of acne in women, the frequency of other clinical markers of androgenicity should increase with acne severity. To investigate this, 268 female subjects (aged 12-44 years) were studied. Subjects were divided into groups on the basis of acne severity: physiological, moderate, and severe. With exclusion of women taking oral contraceptives or anti-androgen therapy, subjects in each group were similar with respect to age at menarche and incidence of menstrual irregularity of amenorrhoea. Reports of excessive body hair, and clinical hirsutes on examination were few and there were no significant differences between acne severity groups. No correlation was observed between acne and hirsutes grades in all subjects (rank correlation coefficient = 0.096). Mild male pattern androgenic alopecia occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the three groups. Female pattern androgenic alopecia was observed in only two subjects. We have shown no correlation between acne severity and clinical markers of androgenicity in women. This suggests that in most cases factors other than hyperandrogenaemia are necessary for the development of acne.\r"

In the present study we used this model to investigate the effect of topical CyA on human hair growth. One group of 15 mice was treated with topical CyA in olive oil, and a second group of 10 mice with olive oil only. The numbers of grafts with hair and the number of hairs per graft in the different groups were compared. A statistically significant delay in hair shedding appeared from day 24 onwards in the CyA treated group. This pilot study supports the possibility that CyA may be effective in the treatment of alopecia.\r"

Increased cutaneous blood flow occurred more often when the lotion was applied to the forearm than to the fingers. A greater increase in blood flow and an increased percentage of positive responses was elicited with the 1.0% hexyl nicotinate lotion.

The clinical features of the two conditions were then compared. In both diseases 60-66% of patients had a family history of the condition. Ichthyosis was noted at birth or immediately afterwards in 59% of the patients with XLI while it appeared in infancy in 68% of those with IV. Scales were mostly large and brown or dark brown in patients with XLI, while the majority of patients with IV had small brown or light brown scales. The distribution of the ichthyotic lesions differed in the two types of ichthyosis. On the trunk, the abdomen was more severely involved than the back in 63% of the cases with the XLI, whereas the back was more scaly than the abdomen in 44% of those with IV. On the extremities, the extensor surface was more severely affected than the flexor surface in both types. X-linked ichthyosis was characterized by the presence of lesions in the pre-auricular area, which were found in 93% of the cases with XLI, while only 17% of the IV patients had ichthyotic lesions at this site. Involvement of the preauricular area could be an important clinical feature for distinguishing XLI from IV.\r"

However, the oesophageal problems seen in SS cannot be sufficiently explained by connective tissue damage/abnormal motility alone. We wondered if temperature dependent ischaemia could occur in the oesophageal microcirculation. We have measured oesophageal temperature variation following oesophageal cold challenge: 50 ml of water at 7 degrees C and 17 degrees C, with 37 degrees C used as control, were introduced into the mid-oesophagus at a rate of 2 ml/s. Temperature was recorded using a thermocouple probe 5 cm above the gastro-oesophageal junction. The test was performed on 14 SS patients, eight patients with Raynaud's disease and 21 controls. The control's rewarming pattern followed a simple exponential curve. This did not vary with temperature or after repeated challenge. In the SS patients the time constant was significantly longer after cold challenge.\r"

They were assessed by a rheumatologist, who established the following diagnoses: four definite RA, eight probable RA, three psoriatic arthritis, one unclassifiable arthritis, 10 osteoarthritis and 22 non-specific arthralgia. No advanced RA was detected. Two were seropositive and another was erosive. One with RA, one with psoriatic arthritis and three with arthralgic symptoms were unable to work.

We have examined, retrospectively, all records of blood counts before, during and after treatment in 326 SASP treated patients and in 213 on gold. Leucopenia on at least one occasion occurred in up to 10% of patients on both drugs but usually recovered spontaneously in spite of continued therapy. 'Serious' leucopenia leading directly to drug withdrawal was a rare event occurring in only one SASP patient and in two patients receiving gold treatment.

A faculty survey of all academic clinicians in the Division of Ophthalmology, Department of Surgery, was carried out in 1984 to determine which problems and diseases the teaching faculty thought had the highest priority for student learning. The results have been used by educational planners in revising the curriculum. They have also served to clarify faculty members' expectations of students within an ophthalmology rotation.\r"

Patients were followed for 6 to 63 (mean 19.7 +/- 11.0) months. There was a mean loss of three letters in acuity, but the difference between initial and final acuity was not statistically significant. In 43 eyes the acuity remained within two lines of the initial acuity, in 17 there was a loss of two lines or more, and in 9 the acuity improved by two lines or more. The initial acuity correlated highly to the final acuity (p less than 0.0001). Multiple linear regression showed that pretreatment existence of macular ischemia or diffuse macular edema or both, when adjusted for initial acuity, age, insulin dependence and duration of diabetes mellitus, was predictive of poorer final acuity than in patients without ischemia or diffuse edema. The results support a consensus that macular edema should be treated early. In view of the conflicting experimental and clinical studies of grid techniques of photocoagulation and the role of the krypton laser, further clinical studies of the treatment of diabetic macular edema are warranted.\r"

A standard flow chart was used to record the medical treatment, intraocular pressure (IOP) and indications for any changes in therapy. No limitations were imposed on the choice of drugs. The mean IOP before treatment was 28 mm Hg. There was a significant reduction in mean IOP of 7.64 mm Hg in response to the first drug prescribed (p less than 0.0001) but none thereafter, despite changes in treatment in 25% to 32% of eyes at each visit. The mean standard deviation of IOP for all eyes was 2.62 mm Hg. Of 99 changes in therapy in 67 eyes, 40% were made when the IOP was within 3 mm Hg of the mean satisfactory pressure for a particular case. The findings indicate the need to make corrections for variation and fluctuation in IOP when evaluating pressure response. The pharmacologic effect of the drugs appeared less important than the patient's ability to tolerate the drugs without severe adverse reactions.\r"

We describe a patient in whom BVMD was suspected on the basis of the clinical findings, EOG and family history (one of her daughters had the typical vitelliform lesion). However, her dark-adapted ERG was markedly abnormal. Similar anomalies were found in the dark-adapted ERG of the daughter. While the temporal features of the various ERG waves were well preserved, a substantial decrease in the amplitude of specific segments of the ERG signal was observed. A similar decrease in the amplitude of the oscillatory potentials was also found. We believe that this unusual combination of BVMD and abnormal dark-adapted ERG may be due to the reported reduced penetrance and variable expressivity of the BVMD gene(s).\r"

A series of tests which covers the range of foreseeable mechanical problems was developed and used to test the performance of three breathing gas interruption monitors, two commercially available and one developed at Vancouver General Hospital. The tests were designed to evaluate the performance of monitors as installed on anaesthesia systems under a variety of failure conditions, including endotracheal tube disconnection with and without occlusion of the opening, kinks in the inspiratory and fresh gas hoses, disconnection of the fresh gas hose, leaks in the breathing circuit, excessive high or low pressure in the scavenging circuit, continuing high breathing circuit pressure, and kinks in the circuit pressure sensing hose. Ability to detect both significant changes in ventilation variables and faults existing at initiation of ventilation were also tested over a representative range of ventilator and patient variables using circle, coaxial and paediatric circuits. Only complete endotracheal tube disconnections with no obstruction of the opening were reliably detected by all three monitors. A commercial monitor with a single fixed-threshold alarm level also detected fresh gas interruptions in circle and adult coaxial circuits, but failed to alarm in response to any other fault condition. A monitor with selectable pressure thresholds and high, low, and continuing pressure limits detected just under half of the fault conditions. A microprocessor-based monitor developed at Vancouver General Hospital detected and correctly identified roughly 80 per cent of the faults. The series of tests forms the basis for a Canadian Standards Association Preliminary Standard (Z168.10) and will allow hospitals to test the performance of breathing gas interruption monitors in use in their institutions. Comments on the test series are solicited.\r"

Patients in Group 1 received oral diazepam or no premedication, while those in Groups 2, 3, and 4 received IM narcotic and atropine one hour preoperatively. Following induction of anaesthesia the residual gastric fluid was aspirated through a Salem sump tube and its volume, pH, and phenol red content measured. Mean volumes were Group 1: 24 ml; Group 2: 13 ml; Group 3: 17 ml; Group 4: 14 ml. Mean pH values were Group 1: 2.99; Group 2: 3.03; Group 3: 3.44; Group 4: 5.28. The amount of phenol red in the samples indicated at least 90 per cent gastric emptying had occurred in 90 per cent of patients. We conclude that, in healthy patients, 150 ml oral fluid is almost completely emptied from the stomach within two hours of ingestion, even when followed one hour later by narcotic-atropine premedication.\r"

This practice could lead to bacterial contamination of these syringes, making them an infection hazard to patients. We did a microbiologic survey of 100 of the most frequently reused syringes in our operating rooms and a control group of 100 single-use syringes. Only three of the syringes were contaminated in each group. None of the patients exposed to the syringes having a positive culture showed any sign of sepsis. Our data suggest that reusing plastic syringes is not associated with an increase in the incidence of bacterial contamination. However, contamination of the syringes by patients' blood, with the risk of cross-infections, remains a possibility and further studies are needed to evaluate this potential hazard.\r"

The overall time to twitch ablation and duration of succinylcholine's action is in agreement with published times obtained under controlled experimental conditions; the onset time following vecuronium is comparable to those observed during a similar anaesthetic background measured under controlled experimental conditions. Twitch ablation after succinylcholine was achieved in half the time needed following vecuronium regardless of anaesthetic agent. Succinylcholine's and vecuronium's onset time as well as succinylcholine's duration is adequately assessed by the outlined, simple clinical means. The choice of inhalation agent does not affect the time to visible twitch ablation in a clinically relevant manner; nor does it make an appreciable difference, in clinical terms, in succinylcholine's duration of action.\r"

Isoflurane one per cent was administered to 14 patients undergoing CPB and isoflurane blood concentrations were measured to determine the time course of washin and washout of this agent. Bubble oxygenators were used for seven patients and membrane oxygenators for the remaining seven. During the administration of isoflurane, isoflurane blood concentrations rose slowly and did not reach a steady state during the time available for washin. Isoflurane blood concentrations decreased by at least 50 per cent within two minutes of turning off the vaporizer, and by 15 minutes the concentration had dropped by 75 per cent. There was a tendency for more rapid elimination of isoflurane in patients undergoing rewarming during this period. There did not appear to be an important difference between bubble and membrane oxygenators in the rate of washin and washout of isoflurane. Within 15 minutes of turning off the vaporizer only 25 per cent of the original blood concentration of isoflurane will remain. The anaesthetist must decide what concentration of isoflurane is acceptable during separation from CPB. Knowledge of the time course of isoflurane washout will allow more accurate determination of when to discontinue its administration in order to reach an acceptable concentration by the time separation from CPB occurs.\r"

Mean age of the patients was 30 years (range 6-66) with a preponderance of males (59 per cent). Associated cardiac disease was found in 18 (9.9 per cent) patients. Induction of anaesthesia employed either a barbiturate-relaxant (83 per cent) or a narcotic-benzodiazepine-relaxant (17 per cent) and was uneventful in all cases. In 14 per cent of cases a pure narcotic relaxant technique was employed for maintenance of anaesthesia, whereas a balanced technique with isoflurane (29 per cent), enflurane (34 per cent), or halothane (22 per cent) was utilized for the remainder. Muscle relaxation was provided by d-tubocurarine in 35 (18 per cent) procedures and pancuronium in the remaining 162 (82 per cent) procedures. There was no significant correlation between intraoperative arrhythmias and type of anaesthetic used. Although recognizing the potential for malignant arrhythmias, our experience (within the confines of a retrospective analysis) suggests that the majority of these patients can be managed successfully using standard anaesthetic techniques.\r"

Vasoconstriction, in addition to topical anaesthesia, was required due to thrombocytopaenia. The use of three per cent lidocaine with 0.125 per cent phenylephrine for anaesthesia and vasoconstriction is described with successful maternal and neonatal outcome.\r"
