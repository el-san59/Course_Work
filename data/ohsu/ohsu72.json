This system affords a useful model for investigating the mechanism by which selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors decrease circulating lipid levels. The results indirectly suggest that hypercholesterolemia induced by dietary cholesterol may involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The basis for linkage between circulating cholesterol levels and sympathetic nervous activity, while not yet understood, may involve changes in the balance among cholesterol pathways in the liver, alteration of vasomotor tone and control of the activity of vascular endothelial lipases. An additive effect is described for cholestyramine and doxazosin, in which low density lipoprotein cholesterol is decreased by 76% by a combination of maximal doses of the 2 agents.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are 2 major risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Elevations of both blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels should be reduced to control CAD risk. Doxazosin is a once-daily, long-acting, selective alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitor that is effective for the treatment of essential hypertension. During controlled studies of doxazosin's antihypertensive efficacy, 3 serum lipid parameters were measured; total cholesterol, total triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In 10- to 12-week placebo-controlled studies, 142 doxazosin-treated patients were compared with 155 placebo-controlled subjects. Doxazosin patients had an increase of 8.9% in the HDL/total cholesterol ratio (p less than 0.05), whereas total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different between the 2 study groups. During a 52-week comparison of doxazosin versus atenolol, doxazosin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in total triglyceride levels (5%; p less than 0.001) and increases in HDL cholesterol levels (3.9%; p less than 0.01) and HDL/total cholesterol ratio (5.4%; p less than 0.0001). Doxazosin is an effective antihypertensive agent that has a favorable impact on serum lipid levels, thereby promoting a beneficial effect on 2 major CAD risk factors.\r"

  ".U": "87238424\r", 
  ".W": "After both oral and intravenous administration, doxazosin is extensively metabolized, with only about 5% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in urine. For single doses, oral bioavailability has been calculated to be about 65%; terminal elimination half-life is approximately 10 to 12 hours. In later multiple-dose studies in which doxazosin concentrations were measured beyond 24 hours after administration, the terminal elimination half-life was 22 hours. Clearance of doxazosin, presumably in the liver, involves the production of mainly O-demethylated and C-hydroxylated metabolites, and is low in comparison with hepatic blood flow. Protein binding is reported to be 98.3% in humans. Relatively low clearance (1.0 to 2.0 ml/min/kg) in association with a moderate volume of distribution (1.0 to 1.9 liters/kg) is responsible for doxazosin's relatively long plasma half-life. There is no evidence to suggest that active metabolites contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity of doxazosin; both hypotensive effect and alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitor activity have been directly related to the concentration of doxazosin in blood. During long-term treatment, no significant changes in the disposition of doxazosin have been reported; with dosages up to the maximum clinically used dosage of 16 mg daily, there is no evidence of dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. Studies in elderly patients have shown no major pharmacokinetic differences. Overall, these pharmacokinetic results suggest that doxazosin is suitable for once-daily administration in the long-term treatment of patients with essential hypertension.\r"

By comparing patients' long-term cardiac status (clinical signs of atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke or death due to atherosclerotic disease) with results from entrance questionnaires, physical examinations, blood pressure measurements, electrocardiograms at rest and blood analyses, the characteristics and strategies for identifying people in the general population who are at risk for developing CAD were to be determined. From PROCAM trial data, 3 predictive criteria for identifying such people have been determined: They are a total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio of 6.5 was determined to be the threshold for CAD risk. Combined analysis of lipid parameters identified high-risk patients as those with cholesterol values of greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl, and low-risk patients as those with cholesterol and triglyceride values less than 200 mg/dl. The remaining subjects are classified according to their HDL cholesterol values. If the HDL cholesterol value is less than 35 mg/dl, the subject is considered to be at high risk, if HDL cholesterol is greater than or equal to 35 mg/dl the patient is considered to be at average risk. The upper 20% of risk was computed by means of a multiple logistic function based on statistics for age, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and family history of myocardial infarction. A further analysis was the risk incurred by hypertension. Hypertension was observed in 16.5% of men and 13.9% of women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calculators and computers can be easily programmed using a multivariate logistic function that allows calculation of the conditional probability of cardiovascular events. These determinations, based on experience with 5,209 men and women participating in the Framingham study, estimate coronary artery disease risk over variable periods of follow-up. Modeled incidence rates range from less than 1% to greater than 80% over an arbitrarily selected 6-year interval; however, they are typically less than 10%, and rarely exceed 45% in men and 25% in women.\r"

Assuming that a residual diameter stenosis of at least 70% is flow limiting, the feasibility for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was determined by the following criteria: length less than 10 mm, no significant distal narrowing or left main stenosis, and an adequate-sized distal artery. In 81 of 99 patients (82%), arterial anatomy was suitable for PTCA. Thus, after therapy with streptokinase for acute myocardial infarction, most patients have a significant infarct arterial residual stenosis and are candidates for PTCA.\r"

The correlations among these parameters were good for patients with anterior AMI (r = 0.74 to 0.78, standard error of the estimate = 29 to 33%) but only fair for those with inferior AMI (r = 0.35 to 0.47, standard error of the estimate = 38 to 73%). Based on previous autopsy studies, estimates of CK-MB and QRS score were then converted to percent of infarcted left ventricle. Linear regression analyses between mean percent AMI size by cumulative CK-MB plus QRS score vs the number of dyssynergic segments by 2-D echocardiography were used to develop a comprehensive formula for estimating AMI size by a combination of all 3 techniques. Thus, a formula is proposed that may optimally estimate AMI size derived from leakage of cytosolic enzymes, changes in the sequence of myocardial depolarization, and irregularities of left ventricular contraction.\r"

Doppler examinations were performed at least 4 weeks after the attack. Twenty-seven healthy persons served as control subjects. Three Doppler variables were measured at the RV inflow tract: the ratio of the late diastolic peak flow velocity due to atrial contraction to the rapid filling peak flow velocity in early diastole (A/E) and the acceleration time and deceleration time of the RV rapid filling wave. A/E in patients with inferior AMI (1.01 +/- 0.24, mean +/- standard deviation) was significantly greater than in those with anterior AMI (0.80 +/- 0.16, p less than 0.001) and angina pectoris (0.79 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.01) and in normal subjects (0.70 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.001).

All patients were followed for at least 2 years or until recurrent AMI, coronary artery bypass grafting or death. Seventeen patients (10%) died during the follow-up period, 15 patients (9%) had recurrent AMI and 45 patients (28%) underwent bypass surgery. Ventricular ectopic activity was the only single treadmill abnormality that predicted subsequent cardiac death; angina pectoris, electrocardiographic ST-segment depression and a hypotensive blood pressure response did not. The mortality rate in the 20 patients with exercise-induced ventricular ectopic activity was 25%, compared with 8% in those without (p less than 0.004). Furthermore, in this patient population, exercise-induced ventricular ectopic activity was a much better predictor of cardiac death than that detected by ambulatory monitoring. Thus, ventricular ectopic activity on the predischarge treadmill exercise test is an important risk factor for death after AMI.\r"

A group of 67-year-old men, drawn from the general population of Gothenburg, Sweden, was studied. Acceptable studies by 2-dimensional echocardiography were obtained from 42 of 49 men with dyspnea of presumed cardiac origin, and from 45 randomly selected nondyspneic control subjects. Both groups originated from a random population sample of 644 men. All men with akinesia, not limited to the basal inferolateral segment, were dyspneic. Akinesia (inferolateral segment only) was found in 4 of 45 control subjects (9%). Six of 20 men (30%) with low-grade dyspnea and 5 of 5 men with the most severe grade of dyspnea had 1 or more akinetic segments. The severity of dyspnea was related to regional wall motion disturbances (as classified in 11 anatomic segments [p less than 0.02 to p less than 0.0001]) and to presence and number of akinetic segments (p less than 0.0001). The degree of dyspnea was correlated to anterior (p less than 0.0001) but not inferior akinesia. The regional wall motion disturbances measured by echocardiography still contributed significantly to the explanation of dyspnea when taking into account the presence or absence of clinical coronary artery disease determined from a 12-lead electrocardiogram, the history of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, and the findings on chest x-ray films. Thus, presumed cardiac dyspnea is a sensitive marker of regional wall motion disturbances. Furthermore, the location of these disturbances may be of importance for the hemodynamic changes leading to cardiac dyspnea.\r"

Doses were titrated to symptoms. The design was a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol with 8 weeks of treatment with each drug. At the end of each drug period, subjects performed 3 exercise tests: a symptom-limited test on a cycle ergometer with measurement of gas exchange parameters; a steady-state exercise test to measure cardiac output by the CO2 rebreathing method; and a supine exercise test with radionuclide angiography. The ISA effect of pindolol was evident at rest in that the heart rate of 82 +/- 4 beats/min was higher than with propranolol (70 +/- 3). At low levels of exercise heart rate, cardiac output and O2 consumption (VO2) were still higher. However, there was no difference in cardiac output or VO2 at higher levels of exercise and no difference in the VO2 at the anaerobic threshold and peak exercise. Peak VO2 was 1,344 +/- 108 ml/min with propranolol and 1,350 +/- 116 with pindolol therapy. There were also no differences in ejection fraction or cardiac volumes at rest or during exercise. The incidence of side effects was similar with both drugs and there was no significant preference for either medication. In conclusion, patients with angina treated with pindolol had the same peak exercise performance as with an 8:1 equivalent dose of propranolol (clinically equivalent), although at lower levels of exercise, VO2, cardiac output and heart rate were higher from the ISA of pindolol.\r"

With exercise, all patients showed diagnostic ST-segment depression (0.16 +/- 0.05 mV) which, in 49, was associated with an increase in S-wave amplitude. No consistent changes in R-wave amplitude were observed. S-wave amplitude also increased in all control subjects during exercise, but the sum of R and S wave remained constant, while it increased in 42 patients. In the 10 study patients undergoing Holter monitoring we identified 170 episodes of ischemic ST-segment depression, of which 169 were associated with increased S-wave amplitude. Isolated increases in S-wave amplitude without ST-segment changes occurred in 3 of 4 normal subjects. Dipyridamole echocardiography revealed regional wall motion abnormalities in 12 of 21 patients; the changes were invariably associated with increased S-wave amplitude but not necessarily with diagnostic ST-segment depression. An increase in S-wave amplitude is almost invariably associated with subendocardial ischemia, sometimes in the absence of ST-segment changes; this sign could represent a sensitive (although less specific) additional marker of myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Vasodilatory capacity of nonstenotic arteries in experimental animals with atherosclerosis is decreased. It was postulated that aortic distensibility may be abnormal in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Aortic distensibility was determined in 24 normotensive patients with CAD and an angiographically normal aorta and values were compared with those in 18 age-matched normal subjects. Aortic diameters were measured at 3 levels--2, 4 and 6 cm above the aortic valve--by angiographic techniques. The area of the first 6 cm of the aorta above the aortic valve was planimetered and mean aortic diameters were calculated. Distensibility was calculated using the formula: [2 X (changes of the aortic diameter)/(diastolic aortic diameter) X (changes of the aortic pressure)]. CAD patients had similar aortic pressures but markedly lower distensibility than normal subjects: 0.7 +/- 0.2 vs 1.7 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.02); 1.5 +/- 0.3 vs 4.0 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.02); and 1.2 +/- 0.2 vs 5.3 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.001) at 2, 4 and 6 cm above the aortic valve, respectively. Distensibility was also calculated from the mean aortic diameters and was greater in normal subjects than in CAD patients (3.4 +/- 0.4 vs 1.6 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.001). Decreased aortic distensibility in CAD may be related to the common atherosclerotic process or to reduced ascending aorta vasa vasorum flow from coronary arteries.\r"

The present study determines if the presence of myocardial ischemic disease with no infarction is a sufficient condition for this to occur, or if the presence of prior acute myocardial infarction (MI) is necessary. In men, first-pass radionuclide ventriculography was performed in the 30 degree left anterior oblique supine position to measure LV ejection fraction, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and heart rate, and to obtain an image of the LV cavitary perimeter. This procedure was performed in 4 subject groups: 13 normal volunteers, 25 patients with coronary artery disease but no prior MI, 13 patients with coronary artery disease and prior nontransmural MI, and 36 patients with coronary artery disease and prior transmural MI. All patients had angina and underwent routine contrast coronary angiography; 60 also underwent contrast coronary angiography; 60 also underwent contrast LV angiography. Ejection fraction decreased during the Mueller maneuver in each of all the coronary artery disease groups (p less than 0.01), but not in the normal subjects. Heart rate increased in groups 1, 2 and 4 (p less than 0.01), and end-diastolic volume decreased in all 4 groups (p less than 0.01), whereas end-systolic volume did not change. Only in group 4 did regional wall akinesia develop (17 patients) during the Mueller maneuver. Among patients who had akinesia during the Mueller maneuver and also underwent routine contrast ventriculography, half of the akinetic segments were not seen on routine contrast study, but were seen only on radionuclide ventriculography during the Mueller maneuver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The testing included maximal treadmill stress with thallium-201 scintigraphy and echocardiography.

Of the 68 patients, 14 (21%) had a mild (9 patients) or moderate (5 patients) decrease in ejection fraction on radionuclide angiography, echocardiography or both. Fifty-two men agreed to remain in the study and have been followed for 12 to 18 months (mean 41 +/- 19). Ten coronary events have occurred. Four of the men died (2 suddenly) and 6 have angina pectoris. Three patients have had vascular complications. Of the clinical and exercise variables studied, exercise duration effectively predicted an adverse outcome, while the odds ratio in favor of a coronary event increased by 36 times in those with thallium-201 defects and 7 times in those with ST-segment changes on exercise. Radionuclide angiographic responses during exercise were abnormal in 5 of 6 patients with events, but were also abnormal in 12 of 29 men (41%) who did not have coronary artery disease. Clinical variables such as blood pressure, cholesterol level and family history were not predictive of outcome, nor was maximal heart rate during exercise. Thus, diabetic mean who can exercise for 440 seconds on a treadmill using a bruce protocol are at low risk of a coronary event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At baseline all patients had VT inducible by programmed stimulation. After amiodarone loading (935 +/- 271 mg/day for 16 +/- 7 days), efficacy of amiodarone was determined by 3 programmed stimulation criteria (criterion I = VT not inducible or 15 beats or less; criterion II = VT not inducible or harder to induce; criterion III = VT not easier to induce). Amiodarone was effective in 12, 25 and 49 of 70 patients by criteria I, II and III, respectively. There were 16 recurrences or cardiac arrest during the follow-up period (19 +/- 19 months). Actuarial arrhythmia-free survival rates at 1 and 2 years were: 90% and 90% in patients with efficacy by criterion I and 78% and 78% in patients with inefficacy, respectively; 84% and 84% in patients with efficacy by criterion II and 78% and 78% in patients with inefficacy, respectively; and 80% and 80% in patients with efficacy by criterion III and 79% and 79% in patients with inefficacy, respectively (difference not significant for all).

Specificities were 17%, 26% and 70%, respectively, and predictive accuracies were 43%, 43% and 67%, respectively. Thus, patients with efficacy by criterion I appear to have a better prognosis when compared with patients with inefficacy. However, many patients with inefficacy by criterion I had a good outcome (nonspecificity).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The physiology of entrainment of orthodromic circus movement tachycardia (CMT) was studied using ventricular pacing during 18 episodes of induced CMT in 7 patients with atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathways. The first paced impulse was delivered as late as possible in the tachycardia cycle (mean 88 +/- 5% of the spontaneous cycle length [CL]). Entrainment was demonstrated by the following criteria: 1:1 retrograde conduction via the accessory pathway; capture of atrial, ventricular and His bundle electrograms at the pacing rate; and resumption of tachycardia at its previous rate after cessation of pacing. The number of ventricular paced impulses ranged from 5 to 14 (mean 8 +/- 3), and entrainment occurred in 2 to 7 paced cycles (mean 4 +/- 2). Orthodromic activation of a major part of the reentry circuit (manifest entrainment) was demonstrated during 9 episodes by the occurrence of His bundle electrogram preceding the first CMT QRS at the time anticipated from the last paced beat. In the 9 other episodes, persistent retrograde His bundle activation and AV nodal penetration by each paced impulse caused a delay (mean 79 +/- 25 ms) in activation of the His bundle preceding the first CMT QRS after the last paced beat. The mean pacing CL achieving manifest entrainment was 92 +/- 3% of the tachycardia CL, compared with 84 +/- 3% for retrograde AV nodal penetration (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, manifest entrainment of orthodromic CMT can be demonstrated by ventricular pacing at very long CLs; shorter CLs may cause CMT termination due to retrograde AV nodal penetration.\r"

Measurements obtained during exercise also included ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide to determine anaerobic threshold. Systolic and diastolic BP responses to exercise before anaerobic threshold were compared with responses after anaerobic threshold by linear regression analyses. The systolic BP response to graded exercise was significantly accelerated (p less than 0.01) after anaerobic threshold, demonstrating a nonlinear response to proportionately graded exercise demand. Comparison of the slopes or rates of change in diastolic BP before and after anaerobic threshold also indicated a significant difference (p less than 0.01) under these 2 different metabolic conditions. It is concluded that in contrast to the linear response of BP under conditions of aerobic metabolism, BP responds nonlinearly during anaerobic metabolism.\r"

Seventy-nine patients were randomized to either dobutamine therapy at incremental doses of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 micrograms/kg/min, or milrinone as a bolus of 50 or 75 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/kg/min. Both agents significantly increased heart rate, cardiac index and stroke volume index and decreased pulmonary artery wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance compared with baseline levels (p less than 0.01). During sustained infusion for 48 hours, no difference in hemodynamic effects was observed between the 2 drugs. Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 5 patients (3 taking milrinone, 2 taking dobutamine); 1 patient taking milrinone had ventricular fibrillation. Milrinone and dobutamine elicited similar beneficial hemodynamic results with relatively few adverse effects.\r"

The endpoints of mortality and mode of death were assessed during a mean follow-up of 6 months. In 91% of the patients, 1 week of oral milrinone therapy was associated with no significant change (85%) or a significant decrease (6%) in the density of ventricular couplets and frequency of ventricular tachycardia. However, in 9% of patients the frequency of complex ventricular arrhythmias increased significantly at the end of 1 week of oral milrinone therapy.

Heart rate did not change (97 +/- 17 vs 97 +/- 22 beats/min). The inotropic response correlated significantly (r = 0.70, p less than 0.05) with the dose of CI-930. Plasma renin activity did not change significantly (from 16 +/- 9 to 23 +/- 15 ng/ml/hour), nor did plasma norepinephrine or arginine vasopressin levels. The plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level decreased (from 153 +/- 97 to 83 +/- 35 pg/ml, p less than 0.02).

Thus, although mean differences were minor, considerable individual variability occurred, the magnitude of which was similar to that reported for other patient populations. In 3 patients who had an initial normal response to exercise (increase in EF greater than or equal to 0.05), the response became abnormal and in 2 who initially had an abnormal response, the response normalized. This variability must be considered in clinical decision-making or in research study design for patients with chronic AR.\r"

By investigating blood flow patterns at the left atrial outflow tract, late diastolic disturbed flow suggesting MR was detected in 15 patients (7%), including 10 (4%) with positive left ventriculographic findings. Among these 15 patients, 14 (93%) had atrial fibrillation and had late diastolic MR in the cardiac cycle with prolonged RR interval. The limitation in number of cardiac cycles that could be analyzed and the rapid heart rate eliminating appearance of the beat with prolonged RR interval may be the reasons for the paucity of late diastolic MR by left ventriculography. Ten patients (66%) with late diastolic MR, including 1 with sinus rhythm, had aortic regurgitation, 3 had high-grade systolic MR and 2 had atrial septal defect. Simultaneous recording of pulmonary artery wedge pressure and left ventricular pressure in 3 patients showed a reversal of pressure gradient in late diastole when the RR interval was prolonged. In conclusion, pulsed Doppler echocardiography was useful for detecting late diastolic MR and in reducing overestimation of systolic MR in left ventriculography induced by erroneous addition of late diastolic MR. The difference of the incidence of this flow between left ventriculography and Doppler examination indicated that this flow depends primarily on heart rate and may come and go in a patient.\r"

There were no significant differences in other rest hemodynamic variables between group 1, patients with a normal exercise factor (more than 600, n = 10), and group 2, patients with an abnormal exercise factor (less than 600, n = 17). A greater increase in stoke volume index (12 +/- 6 vs 2 +/- 8 ml/beats/m2, mean +/- standard deviation) and a greater decrease in systemic vascular resistance with exercise occurred in group 1 than in group 2 (-614 +/- 304 vs -406 +/- 291 dynes cm-5). Elevation of right ventricular end-diastolic pressure with exercise was significantly greater in group 2 than in group 1 (7 +/- 5 vs 1 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.05). A maintained cardiac reserve in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy appears to be largely dependent on 2 primary factors: preservation of normal right ventricular function during exercise; and preservation of systemic vasodilator capability sufficient to produce a significant degree of afterload reduction during exercise.\r"

All patients underwent cardiac catheterization and electrophysiologic studies. Ventricular tachycardia was induced at electrophysiologic study in all patients in group I and in 3 patients in group II. Six patients with inducible sustained monomorphic VT underwent chronic drug testing based on electrophysiologic study. A mean of 3.3 drugs per patient was tested. Patients with right ventricular systolic hypertension did not respond to any drug tested, and underwent surgery. Five patients received drug treatment based on the results of electrophysiologic study. During a mean follow-up period of 2.2 years, no patient in either group had recurrent episodes of VT or syncope. In the postoperative patient with tetralogy of Fallot with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, it is concluded that electrophysiologic study is useful in reproducing clinical episodes of VT and in selecting effective antiarrhythmic medication; a small number of patients with ventricular premature complexes alone will have inducible sustained VT during electrophysiologic study; prognosis of these patients may be improved by treatment that results in prevention of VT induction; and in patients with right ventricular hypertension, VT is likely to be refractory to drug treatment.\r"

The increase in peak velocity was greater in children with AS than in normal children. Measurements of left ventricular (LV) aortic pressure differences by cardiac catheterization were compared to those made by CWD, using the modified Bernoulli equation. The best correlation of the CWD prediction of LV aortic pressure differences was achieved when the children were sedated. The peak velocity of blood flow in the ascending aorta varied with level of activity, and this variability must be considered when using the Bernoulli equation to predict LV aortic pressure differences. CWD prediction of the LV aortic pressure difference was best when the child was sedated (r = 0.98). It is therefore prudent to consider the velocity measurement proximal to the AS to calculate LV aortic pressure differences more accurately unless the child is sedated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximal velocity of lengthening of the LV cavity was significantly lower in premature infants (38 +/- 7 mm/s) than in term infants (88 +/- 15 mm/s). This variable increased with increasing maturity over the 4 gestational age groups evaluated (r = 0.87). This index normalized for instantaneous LV dimension was lower in the most immature infants (4.5 +/- 1 s-1) than in term infants (6.8 +/- 2 s-1). Eight of the premature infants were studied serially at 1, 3 and 7 days of age. Maximal velocity of lengthening divided by stroke dimension improved from 12.9 +/- 2 s-1 at 1 day of age to 16.5 +/- 3 s-1 at 7 days.

This hypothesis was tested using computer-based quantitative analysis of LV mass and CSA from angiographic images of the left ventricle and proximal coronary arteries from 19 men and 21 women, aged 23 to 78 years (mean 56). Twenty-seven patients had valvular heart disease, 16 of whom had multivalvular involvement; diagnoses included aortic stenosis in 19, aortic regurgitation in 13 and mitral regurgitation in 12. Thirteen patients had normal valvular and ventricular function. All patients had normal coronary arteries. Significant differences between normal patients and those with valvular disease were noted in LV mass (88 +/- 7 vs 165 +/- 12 g/m2, p less than 0.001) and coronary CSA (26 +/- 2 vs 46 +/- 3 mm2, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, a linear relation between LV mass and coronary CSA was noted (r = 0.788, p less than 0.001). Thus, proximal coronary artery CSA is significantly larger in valvular heart disease patients with LV hypertrophy than in those with normal ventricles, and proximal coronary artery area increases in proportion to LV mass in hypertrophied ventricles.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relation of left ventricular (LV) afterload, hypertrophy, geometry and systolic pump function, 17 normal persons, 24 patients with aortic stenosis (AS), 20 with aortic regurgitation (AR) and 15 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) were studied. Two-dimensional echograms were used to assess end-systolic meridional and circumferential stresses and their ratio, LV mass, relative wall thickness (h/R ratio) and the ratio of LV minor axis to length, used as an index of shape. Independently obtained ejection fraction (EF) was used to determine which patients had normal (EF greater than or equal to 55%) and which had depressed (EF less than 55%) pump function. Patients with AS and low EF had similar LV mass (228 vs 215 g) but larger LV cavity (5.6 vs 4.5 cm), lower h/R ratio (0.53 vs 0.73, p less than 0.01), and therefore higher circumferential stress (336 vs 268 kdyne/cm2, p less than 0.05). Compared with normal persons, patients with DC had a lower h/R ratio (0.28 vs 0.38, p less than 0.01), higher circumferential stress (362 vs 215 kdyne/cm2, p less than 0.01) and more uniform stress distribution (meridional to circumferential stress ratio 0.57 vs 0.39, p less than 0.01), implying that meridional stress overestimates effective afterload. Afterload excess and LV shape change may be important to pump function in patients with AS or DC. In contrast, in those with AR, no significant shape differences were noted, although LV mass was higher in those with low EF (279 vs 211 g, p less than 0.05). Depressed pump function may result from impaired myocardial performance in AR without afterload excess.\r"

The other 29 members underwent clinical examination, electrocardiography, chest x-ray and M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography. Fourteen patients found to have structural abnormalities of the right ventricle underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording and symptom-limited bicycle stress testing. Hemodynamic and angiographic studies were performed in 6 of these patients. In this family the arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia showed a wide variation of abnormalities, ranging from mild, local alterations to generalized involvement of the right ventricle. The patients were separated into 3 groups on the basis of both the clinical profile and noninvasive/invasive studies: 3 subjects who died suddenly; 3 subjects who had severe ventricular arrhythmias; and 8 subjects in whom RV impairment was not associated with any significant arrhythmias. There was no close relation between the severity of the RV abnormality and presence of ventricular arrhythmias. The variability of the RV abnormality and the high prevalence of this condition in this family is consistent with a genetic pattern of autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance.\r"

In repeated dose toxicity studies, no drug-related pathologic changes were evident; dryness of the oral mucosa in dogs and body weight gain reductions in rodents were the only significant clinical signs. In a chronic (52 week) toxicity study in rats, pirmenol given in the diet was tolerated clinically at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. No drug-related aberrations in clinical laboratory parameters or ophthalmic or pathologic findings were evident. In a similar study in beagle dogs, pirmenol was tolerated clinically at a dosage up to 30 mg/kg/day. No significant changes in biochemical, hematologic, urinary or bone marrow determinations were found in either species. In reproductive toxicology studies in rats, pirmenol had no significant effect on litter size or embryonic viability. In rabbits pirmenol had no effect on average litter size, embryonic viability or fetal wastage. Given to male rats, pirmenol had no overt effects on fertility. Pirmenol failed to elicit deoxyribonucleic acid damage or induce cytogenetic alterations. Pirmenol appears to be without significant limiting toxicologic properties.\r"

Oral absorption of pirmenol was complete and devoid of significant first-pass metabolism. Systemic oral bioavailability averaged 87% in humans. Pirmenol was 83% to 90% bound to human plasma proteins. Animal studies showed that pirmenol was widely distributed in tissues resulting in higher drug concentrations in tissue than in plasma. Pirmenol was partly eliminated as unchanged drug and partly metabolized. Tracer studies in animals showed that approximately 40% to 50% of the administered radioactive dose was excreted in the urine and the remainder in the feces. The latter route was due to excretion of radioactivity in the bile. Evidence of enterohepatic recycling was established in bile duct-cannulated monkeys. Approximately 23% to 31% of the administered pirmenol dose was recovered unchanged in human urine.\r"

Animal pharmacology studies showed that pirmenol is highly efficacious whether the arrhythmias were atrial or ventricular in origin, chemically, mechanically or electrically induced or of the automaticity or reentrant types. The conscious coronary artery-ligated (Harris) dog model best allowed simulation of a variety of clinical situations in which pirmenol could be used either alone or in combination. Pirmenol was highly effective by both the intravenous and oral routes, causing immediate suppression, prevention or termination of cardiac arrhythmias. Preclinical studies in the dog showed an excellent correlation between the dose of pirmenol, plasma levels and antiarrhythmic efficacy. Administration of pirmenol in the dog at intentionally accelerated infusion rates suggested a relatively wide margin of safety for pirmenol compared with other class I agents. Analysis of the pharmacokinetic data led to the modeling of a rapid infusion-slow infusion bolus for sustained intravenous administration, thereby optimizing therapeutic utility. In vitro electrophysiologic studies in dog Purkinje fibers revealed possibly unique differences of pirmenol from other antiarrhythmic agents. It depresses fast and slow response automaticity and its electrophysiologic effects were less variable than other class I drugs over a spectrum of potassium levels. To test the relevance of the in vitro electrophysiologic results, pirmenol's antiarrhythmic efficacy was assessed in several in vivo dog models in which serum potassium was either increased or decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients ranged in age from 39 to 84 years (mean 61); the presenting arrhythmia was sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 and ventricular fibrillation in 2. After discontinuation of all antiarrhythmic drugs (for at least 5 half-lives) and assessment of electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic parameters in the drug-free state, patients underwent comprehensive intracardiac electrophysiologic evaluation with intravenous pirmenol (mean dose 195 +/- 46 mg). Programmed ventricular stimulation began at least 30 minutes after pirmenol infusion was started in each patient. There was significant shortening of sinus cycle length in all patients, from 746 +/- 155 to 683 +/- 107 ms (mean +/- standard deviation). In 7 patients in whom ventricular tachycardia could not be induced after intravenous pirmenol, an oral pirmenol regimen was begun. The dosage was 200 or 250 mg (both 3 times/day) in 2 and 5 patients, respectively. Seven hours after the third dose of oral drug was given, these patients underwent repeat electrophysiologic testing. Intravenous and oral pirmenol significantly prolonged the PR, QT, QTc and JT intervals compared with baseline. Intravenous pirmenol also significantly prolonged the QRS interval compared with baseline. Oral pirmenol significantly prolonged the sinus node recovery time compared with intravenous pirmenol. Intravenous pirmenol significantly increased the HV interval compared with control; oral pirmenol did not demonstrate a significant prolongation of the HV interval, but this is due to the smaller number of patients studied while taking oral drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Termination was successful in 11 of 17 patients who had a spontaneous attack and in 3 of 8 patients who had induced tachycardia. Pirmenol was effective in 3 of 5 patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant mechanism, but in none of 3 patients with a reentrant tachycardia with a retrogradely conducting atrioventricular bypass tract. Conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 14 of 25 patients (56%). No hemodynamic adverse effects occurred. Pirmenol increased the atrial effective refractory period, but had little effect on conduction in the atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje system. Reentry was abolished through a block in the retrograde part of the dual atrioventricular nodal pathway, which is typical of class I antiarrhythmic agents.\r"

  ".W": "The Oxylog (PK Morgan, Kent, UK) is a recently developed portable device for measurement of oxygen consumption and energy expenditure in man. It incorporates a turbine flowmeter and two polarographic oxygen sensors and is powered by rechargeable batteries. Two instruments were modified for operation at low ventilation rates and used in simultaneous Oxylog and Douglas Bag measurements of resting metabolic rate (RMR) in nine healthy subjects. The coefficients of correlation between RMR measured by the two methods were +0.904 (p less than 0.02) and +0.934 (p less than 0.01) and the standard errors of the mean percent error in energy expenditure were +/- 2.0% and +/- 2.7% for the two instruments respectively. This suggests that the Oxylogs are sufficiently accurate for many field studies of energy expenditure.\r"

A total of 18 healthy men and women underwent all three measurement techniques in three consecutive 20-min measurement periods in a Latin square design. No significant effects were found for either period or method with respect to oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and caloric expenditure. Oxygen consumption was (mean +/- SD) 250 +/- 45, 251 +/- 47, and 254 +/- 49 mL/min for hood, mask, and mouthpiece, respectively (ns). The respiratory exchange ratio was lower for the hood (0.809 +/- 0.051) than mask (0.837 +/- 0.043) and mouthpiece (0.847 +/- 0.045) but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Calculated caloric expenditure was 1.20 +/- 0.22, 1.21 +/- 0.22, and 1.23 +/- 0.23 kcal/min for hood, mask, and mouthpiece, respectively (ns). Thus, in healthy individuals similar results are obtained by the three methods and the face mask and mouthpiece are acceptable alternatives to the ventilated hood for estimation of resting energy expenditure.\r"

The test meal contained 60% of the energy expended in basal state over 24 h (736-1020 kcal/meal according to the group). In obese subjects the net absolute increase in energy expenditure (delta EE) in response to the meal was similar between exercising and resting conditions (delta EE = 0.27 vs 0.32 kcal/min, respectively) but tended to be lower in obese women after weight loss (delta EE = 0.19 kcal/min while exercising and 0.25 kcal/min while resting, p less than 0.05) and in control subjects (delta EE = 0.16 vs. 0.25 kcal/min, respectively: p less than 0.05).

Twenty-eight women received dietary supplements in amounts previously shown to increase birth weight. In unsupplemented women, fat gain was profoundly affected by the seasons through which the pregnancy progressed, ranging from an estimated loss of 4.7 kg to a net gain of 3 kg at various times of the year. Adjustment for season revealed, however, that pregnancy per se was without effect on body fat content. Supplementation increased fat gain during pregnancy by approximately 2 kg (p less than 0.05) and gave protection against the worst effects of season on energy balance. These findings contribute to our understanding of the consequences of low food intake during pregnancy and the effects of dietary supplementation on birth weight.\r"

To accommodate the small volumes of capillary blood usually obtained, we modified the experimental conditions of the L-tyrosine apodecarboxylase (TDC) assay for PLP by increasing both the specific activity of 14C-tyrosine and the reaction incubation time. Plasma PLP concentrations determined by the TDC assay and the micro-modified TDC assay were highly correlated (r = 0.995, p = 4.0 X 10(-6)). Using the micro-modified TDC assay, we observed no significant difference between the plasma PLP concentrations of venous and capillary (finger prick) blood from 10 healthy adults. Thus, capillary blood plasma can be used to estimate the PLP concentration of venous blood plasma. This observation will aid in verifying data concerning the vitamin B-6 status assessment of individuals as determined by capillary blood plasma PLP concentrations.\r"

During the 4 mo after completion of the first distribution, mortality among preschool capsule recipients was less than 4% that of nonrecipients (p less than 0.001). Mortality among preschool nonrecipients was three times that of controls (p less than 0.05), suggesting strong selection bias. The potential biologic impact on childhood mortality attributable to vitamin A supplementation is estimated to exceed the 34% previously derived from the more conservative intent-to-treat analysis. One capsule every 6 mo may provide adequate protection for the vast majority of children. The single major limitation to maximum impact appears to be inadequate program coverage.\r"

There were no significant differences in bioavailability of riboflavin and pyridoxine hydrochloride between the SEG formulation and the tablet albeit a trend toward consistent absorption was seen from the SEG formulation. The modified-SEG formulation exhibited significantly lower bioavailability for these water-soluble vitamins. The enhanced bioavailability of vitamin E and the trend towards faster and more consistent absorption of riboflavin and vitamin B-6 from the SEG formulation may be related to the surfactant vehicle employed and the attendant wetting properties. The results also suggest ethnic differences in vitamin bioavailability.\r"

During this year, food intake was not depressed in zinc-deprived (ZD) monkeys, and there were relatively few effects on biochemical or hematological indices. By the end of the year, plasma zinc concentration was somewhat lower in ZD monkeys than in controls. Several immune variables, including serum IgM and IgG levels and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function, were depressed in the ZD group, changes closely reflecting circannual fluctuations in plasma zinc levels in both diet groups. Endotoxin-activated plasma from ZD monkeys had less potential to promote chemotaxis than that from control monkeys, suggesting that defective PMN function may relate to a plasma effect. Marginal zinc deprivation may thus influence immune function before other variables are affected.\r"

There was a significant positive association between plasma zinc and PHA response. At midgestation, discriminant analysis revealed that maternal lymphocyte response to Con A, fetal abdominal circumference (by ultrasound), plasma fibrinogen, serum IgM, and amniotic fluid iron level were discriminators for diet group, all lower in ZD than in C monkeys. Maternal plasma and RBC zinc at midgestation were positively associated with fetal growth and plasma uric acid. These observations suggest that immune function (ie, mitogen response and serum immunoglobulin level) is a strong discriminator of dietary zinc deprivation in rhesus monkeys, both before and during pregnancy.\r"

This dietary model allowed simple formulation of new menus for subjects in diverse states of health. It caused no ill effects after prolonged consumption, and all deficiency symptoms were reversed by zinc supplementation of 30 mg/d for 20 wk.

White blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, 3PDs, and histograms were compared with smear differentials on 3,861 samples, including samples from oncology patients, to determine the predictive value of the Coulter parameters in detecting smear abnormalities. Results showed good correlation between the 3PD and smear differential for granulocytes and lymphocytes (correlation coefficients were 0.883 and 0.868, respectively) and poor correlation for mononuclear cells (0.492). No histogram region flag indicators were observed in the following samples: 15 of 40 samples with greater than or 1% blasts; 105 of 183 with greater than or 1 nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) per 100 WBCs; 65 of 113 with monocytosis greater than 1,600/microL (1.6 X 10(9)/L); 425 of 548 with greater than 2,000 bands/microL (2.0 X 10(9)/L); 84 of 112 with eosinophilia greater than 600/microL (0.6 X 10(9)L); and 88 of 149 with greater than 2% immature granulocytes. All samples with greater than 5% blasts were indicated by region flags and abnormal histograms. Oncology patient data were analyzed, yielding similar results. The authors established guidelines for using the Coulter 3PD data in their tertiary care laboratory to select samples that require smear evaluation.\r"

In situ DNA hybridization has been effective for detection of CMV in otherwise nondiagnostic histologic material. Studies comparing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with open-lung biopsy have shown the former to be superior in detecting most pulmonary pathogens affecting immunocompromised patients. Fifty consecutive BAL specimens were studied to compare direct in situ DNA hybridization, routine tissue culture, and conventional cytologic examination to assess the efficacy of the hybridization technic to rapidly detect CMV. Using tissue culture as the standard, a sensitivity of 90% (28 of 31) and specificity of 63% (12 of 19) were observed with the CMV probe. Discrepant results between the probe and tissue culture were present in ten cases. There were seven probe-positive, culture-negative cases, three of which had systemic CMV infection, including two patients with inclusions noted by conventional cytologic examination. Three probe-negative, culture-positive cases were found. In the authors' laboratory, the predictive value of a positive CMV probe is 80% (28 of 35). In contrast to the probe, conventional cytologic examination revealed CMV inclusions in only 23% (7 of 31) of the culture-positive cases. An average of 21 days was required for CMV cultures to become positive; probe results were available within 24 hours. The authors conclude direct in situ DNA hybridization is a useful rapid method for the detection of CMV in BAL specimens submitted for cytologic examination.\r"

  ".W": "A difficulty encountered during antimicrobial clinical trials is to determine whether a patient's death was related to uncontrolled bacteremia or other factors. Because the postmortem spleen culture correlates with untreated antemortem bacteremia, a study was performed to determine the association of the duration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy with the recovery of the blood culture organism from the postmortem spleen. During the last 10 days of life, blood cultures from 79 patients yielded 85 organisms. The spleen yielded 96%, 55%, 41%, and 35% of the blood culture organisms in patients receiving appropriate antibiotics for 0, less than 2, 2-4, and greater than 4 days, respectively. Statistical analysis with the use of chi-square test for stratified data showed this to be a significant trend. This correlation suggests that postmortem spleen cultures may be of value in assessing antimicrobial therapy in patients dying within ten days of proven bacteremia.\r"

Methanol exposure during preparation of the sampling site or in the course of specimen handling, ingestion of denatured alcohol, as well as methanol production from the metabolism of aspartame are ruled out as causes for these findings.

Within one year after radiotherapy, cortisol levels had returned to normal (but with continued absence of diurnal variation), growth velocity improved, and puberty ensued. Five years after treatment, the patient developed clinical and biochemical evidence of recurrent CD. The high baseline evening corticotropin level (9 pmol/L [40 pg/mL]) was unresponsive (maximum level, 10 pmol/L [46 pg/mL]) to stimulation with ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRF). In patients with CD treated with radiotherapy, the corticotropin response to CRF stimulation may not be reliably compared with that of normal control values. After pituitary adenomectomy, the corticotropin concentration was still unresponsive to CRF. We suggest that the pituitary tumor was secondary to abnormal hypothalamic CRF regulation not corrected by pituitary irradiation; therefore, CD may recur despite pituitary irradiation.\r"

When that sudden death is due to a known cause, the concrete character of the event can be incorporated into the normal rationalization of mourning. However, when death is due to an unknown mechanism, as in the sudden infant death syndrome, feelings of inadequacy in caring for the child are reinforced. The essential need for support of these families is clear. For physicians, this kind of loss is disquieting and anxiety-provoking. Forty-seven physicians responded to a survey exploring the relationship between the physician and the family after the death of an infant, the feelings of the physician about the death and his or her own sense of loss, and the physician's need for personal support and educational preparation for such an event. While 41 of the physicians indicated they had discussed the death with the family, six had made no contact with the survivors. Thirty-six of the respondents indicated that their relationship with the family continued, and ten physicians stated that their relationship terminated after the death. Physicians characterized their initial responses to the death as frustration, sadness, shock, anger, guilt, regret, hurt, and inadequacy. Most of the physicians believed that they had \"missed\" something and feared they might be blamed for the death. The competence, sincerity, and sensitivity shown to families during this tragic experience can positively influence the family's mourning and recovery. The pediatrician can provide a rational voice and a medical understanding of tragedy without blame.\r"

We examined the hypotheses that in children (1) CSF levels of calcium and phosphorus might be low, (2) CSF levels of magnesium might be higher than serum levels of magnesium, and (3) immunoreactive calcitonin might be present in the CSF. We examined serum and CSF samples of 45 children, aged 8 days to 16 years, undergoing spinal taps for suspected meningitis or as part of leukemia therapy. Both serum and CSF levels of calcium correlated with those of magnesium. There was no correlation for CSF levels vs serum levels of calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus. The CSF levels of calcium and phosphorus were lower than the serum levels of these elements, but the CSF levels of magnesium were higher than the serum levels of magnesium. Calcitonin was detected in the CSF of 8% of samples assayed (range, 14 to 175 ng/L [14 to 175 pg/mL]). Two of these five samples had bacteriologically proven meningitis, and two samples were from patients less than 2 months of age. The CSF levels of calcitonin did not correlate with the serum levels of calcitonin. Thus, in children CSF levels of calcium and phosphorus are low, CSF levels of magnesium are higher than the serum levels, and the level of immunoreactive calcitonin is usually not present in the CSF but possibly is elevated in meningitis and early infancy.\r"

We treated four children with classes I through III lead poisoning (range of blood lead [Pb-B] level, 1.6 to 2.75 mumol/L [33 to 57 micrograms/dL]) who had significant elevation of their Pb-B levels (range, peak 4.34 to 6.27 mumol/L [90 to 130 micrograms/dL]) following deleading of their homes. The methods used for deleading included scraping, sanding, and burning of the paint. Symptoms included irritability (n = 3) and vomiting (n = 1). The elevation of the Pb-B levels was detected early, allowing prompt chelation therapy. Because exacerbation of lead poisoning may occur in children following deleading of their homes, safer approaches of deleading should be determined.\r"

Forty-six of 50 operators achieved an adequate minute ventilation, and 48 of 50 operators achieved a mean tidal volume exceeding that of the mask plus simulated physiologic dead space. Wide variation with a tendency to hyperventilate and to use excessive pressures indicate the need for improved standard training methods. Technical difficulties with an anesthesia bag impaired performance, suggesting that only self-inflatable bags should be used for mask-bag ventilation during pediatric resuscitation, unless the staff's proficiency with anesthesia bags is clearly demonstrated.\r"

At 30 days of age, 39% of surviving infants who had received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours were still respirator dependent; 15% were only oxygen dependent. By 3 months, the rates had fallen to 8% and 7%, respectively. By 6 months of age, only 1.6% were respirator dependent but 3% were oxygen dependent and 9% had died. The NICUs differed widely in incidence of CLD, without relation to number of very-low-birth-weight infants treated or to whether treatment was by pediatric residents. Rates of CLD among survivors at 30 days were not inversely related to prior mortality rates. Incidence varied inversely by birth weight, but differences among NICUs were only partly due to differing weight distributions.\r"

In the second group (n = 135, 13.3%), the CHD was part of a malformation syndrome, embryopathy, association, or complex. In one fourth of the 56 chromosomal syndromes, the underlying cytogenetic anomaly differed from trisomy 21. Fourteen of the 30 children with non-chromosomal malformation syndromes had Noonan's syndrome. Thirteen of the 27 embryopathies were due to rubella infection, but alcohol embryopathy occurred nearly as often (n = 10). In those children with malformation associations (n = 16) seven showed cardiofacial association. Three of the five children with malformation complexes had Ivemark disease. In this study, underlying disorders were found in one of eight children with CHD, a considerably higher percentage than that reported in earlier studies.\r"

Eighty subsibs were screened in hospital at an average age of 4.6 weeks. The most valuable investigations included history, physical examination, blood gas tests, and four days on an apnea monitor in hospital. Sleep recordings added no decision-making data. Only 23 infants met one of the following criteria for home apnea monitoring: (1) sleep apnea for more than 15 s (either on sleep recording or recognized by apnea alarm), (2) more than 4.5 episodes of apnea per hour of sleep, (3) periodic breathing greater than 24% of sleep time, or (4) severe parental anxiety. Twenty-two infants were monitored until they were aged 6 months and had spent two months apnea free. Twelve had apnea at home. All of the infants survived. Excessive periodic breathing alone did not seem to be a valid reason for home monitoring. Our screening program is simple, acceptable to families, and useful to select a smaller number of subsibs for home apnea monitoring.\r"

Sixty-four patients remained HBsAg-negative after reaching end-stage renal disease; 30 were transiently or persistently HBsAg-positive; seven patients were excluded from study because of insufficient data. The HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative patients did not differ with respect to age, sex, race, or etiology of renal disease. There were no differences between the positive and negative groups in terms of death rates (50% v 34.4%, P = not significant), causes of death, hospitalizations (1.5 v 1.2/patient/yr), or hospitalized days (18.0 v 11.8 patient/yr). Only mild liver enzyme elevation (SGOT) was observed at the time of conversion in 13 patients with enzyme abnormalities who seroconverted after beginning hemodialysis (mean SGOT 255 micron/mL). No patient had persistent liver enzyme elevation over the 8-year period. These data suggest that chronic hepatitis B surface antigenemia is not, in itself, associated with increased morbidity or mortality in a chronic hemodialysis population.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral edema in uremic animals and humans, as well as an EEG deterioration in humans, has been reported after dialysis. Both are manifestations of the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS). This study was designed to analyze the changes induced by dialysis in the EEG pattern (spectral analysis), in the cerebral hydration, and ventricular size (computed tomography [CT] of the brain) in a group of 11 stable uremic patients. They volunteered for a randomized crossover study of 4 months each of standard hemodialysis (HD) and hypertonic hemodiafiltration (H HDF). H HDF is a dialysis technique that is shorter and more efficient than HD. An EEG recording, a CT scan of the brain, and blood biochemistry were performed before and after a HD (four hours, blood flow rate 250 mL/min) and a H HDF run (three hours, blood flow rate 400 mL/min). Approximately 6 weeks of stabilization on each treatment were allowed before these studies. No difference was found in the density of seven specific brain structures (base and apical cuts), when comparing pre- v post-HD, pre- v post-H HDF, pre- HD v pre-H HDF, and post-HD v post-H HDF. Furthermore, no difference was evident either in the bicaudate diameter of the lateral ventricles or in the transverse diameter of the third ventricle. In addition, no significant in-between- and within-treatment difference was observed when analyzing the EEG% power (3-7/7-13 Hz) data. In conclusion, this study shows neither a postdialysis change in brain density and ventricular size nor a postdialysis EEG deterioration in a group of stable uremic patients undergoing both a rapid and a standard dialysis treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An epidemic of renal disease is occurring among the Zuni Indians in western New Mexico. In 1985, 1.6% of Zunis had clinically recognized renal disease and 1% had renal insufficiency. The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 1984 and 1985 was 14 times the rate for US whites, and three times the rates of other Indians in ESRD network 6. One third of the cases of renal disease and ESRD is due to type 2 diabetes, but the etiology of disease in most of the remainder is unknown. Affected subjects range from early childhood to old age. Early signs are hematuria, mild to moderate proteinuria, normal BP, and low total hemolytic complement, normal or low C3 and C4 levels, in about 40% of the cases. The clinical course varies from benign to rapidly progressive renal failure. Biopsies usually reflect an immune-complex mediated mesangiopathic glomerulonephritis, with IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 variably present in the mesangium. In some cases, there is a very strong familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance or a marked communal exposure effect. This may be a genetic disease educed by the consanguinity in the ethnically homogeneous Zuni population. Mesangiopathic renal disease is common in some Oriental populations, and this phenomenon may reflect the American Indians' Oriental ancestry. This disease may also be due to toxic exposures related to jewelry-making, potting, Zuni water, Zuni salt, or herbal or other products used for medicinal or religious purposes. This epidemic is much morbidity and generating huge costs for ESRD treatment. Further study is needed to better understand its etiology.\r"

Only 51 such cases have been reported, 15 of which had ARF as the initial presentation of lymphoma. The clinical and pathologic features of these 15 cases and of two additional cases reported herein are reviewed. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient with ARF, bilateral enlargement of the kidneys, minimal proteinuria, nonspecific findings on urinalysis, and absence of features of allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Renal imaging techniques may suggest the possibility of lymphomatous infiltration, but only renal biopsy or autopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis. Although modern chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy usually leads to a dramatic normalization of renal function, almost all patients eventually die of widespread recurrent lymphoma, despite the absence of clinical or pathologic involvement of the kidneys at the time of death.\r"

Neither the propositus or the siblings had the distinctive mesangial sclerosis of nephropathy-XY dysgenesis, type 1 (Drash syndrome). The association of nephropathy-XY dysgenesis with familial nephritis of heterogeneous pathology suggests that nephropathy-XY dysgenesis, type 2, may relate to separate genetic loci for XY dysgenesis and glomerulopathy or reflect a loss of protection against familial renal disease when the Y chromosome is absent or defective.\r"

Three groups of families from the collaborative Lipid Research Clinics Program Family Study were assessed: 1,146 selected at random, 483 obtained through hypercholesterolemic probands, and 177 selected from the random sample because a number had low HDL-C, the sample sizes being 4,279, 1,807 and 735, respectively. The data were first transformed and adjusted for effects of covariates. Analyses were performed within clinic and selection strata and also pooled across clinics within strata. The results were consistent across strata and identified two major HDL-C clusters with means separated by approximately 3 SD. There was significant evidence of transmission of a major factor for low HDL-C, but transmission did not conform to Mendelian segregation expectations. There was also evidence of significant multifactorial transmission. Since low HDL-C levels are a major independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, the association of a major factor with familial aggregation of low HDL-C emphasizes the importance of detailed within-family sampling for low HDL-C after identifying a proband whose predominant dyslipoproteinemia is low HDL-C.\r"

  ".W": "Medical treatment of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has been generally accepted because of the proven efficacy of the histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in achieving symptomatic relief, and because of early reports indicating that few, if any, gastrinomas were resectable for cure. Gastrin radioimmunoassay (RIA) has made earlier and more certain diagnosis possible, and therefore reevaluation of the surgical management of gastrinomas is necessary. Experience with 60 gastrinoma patients is reported. Comparison between the pregastrin RIA years (before 1970) and post-gastrin RIA years was made to determine whether there was evidence to support the continuation of medical treatment without attempts to resect the gastrinoma. Twenty-five cases were diagnosed in the pre-RIA years. Age at diagnosis ranged from 17 to 68 years (median, 45 years). All patients were operated on. Metastases were found in 56 percent. No tumor was identified in 8 percent. Tumor was resected for \"cure\" (normal fasting gastrin levels for two years postoperatively) in one patient. Seventeen patients have died, and tumor was the cause of death in 70 percent. The five-year survival rate was 44 percent; the 10-year survival rate was 40 percent. Thirty-five cases were diagnosed after 1970. Age at diagnosis ranged from 39 to 61 years (median, 46 years). Thirty patients were operated on. Metastases were identified in 23 percent and no tumor was found in 17 percent. Tumor was resected for \"cure\" in 30 percent of patients. Seven patients have died and tumor caused death in 42 percent. The five-year survival rate was 82 percent; the 10-year rate was 64 percent. Advances in diagnosis and surgical technique since 1970 have made early operative treatment applicable in patients with gastrinoma. Because death in most cases is caused by progression of the tumor, an aggressive surgical approach to resect the tumor is advised soon after the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is established.\r"

Industrial absenteeism, hospitalizations of adults and infants for pneumonia, and deaths due to pneumonia-influenza all tend to peak later in the epidemic. Although influenza infection rates are highest in persons of school age, hospitalizations and deaths occur primarily in infants and in the elderly, particularly among those with pulmonary, cardiovascular, or other debilitating disorders. Influenza viruses can be spread by aerosol or contact. The primary target cells are those of the respiratory epithelium. In healthy adults, the typical influenza syndrome includes fever, cough, and general aches for three to seven days, but lassitude, cough, and evidence of small-airways disease may persist for weeks. Laryngotracheobronchitis, pneumonia, and unexplained fever are prominent manifestations of influenza that lead to hospitalization of young children. Adults are more likely to have complications of bacterial pneumonia and worsening of chronic pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure. Less frequent complications include myositis, various neurologic disorders, and Reye's syndrome. These consequences of influenza clearly justify strenuous efforts at prevention and control.\r"

  ".W": "Because of their dramatic impact, morbidity and mortality associated with influenza have been recognized since at least the time of Elizabeth I of England. Excess mortality has been documented since 1889, and the infamous 1918 outbreak confirmed that influenza was truly one of the last major plagues. Despite the clear recognition of large clusters of influenza activity, it is still difficult to quantify precisely the total impact of influenza morbidity and mortality, since laboratory confirmation is required for exact diagnosis. Many methods have been developed to provide estimates of the mortality associated with influenza. These methods are usually predicated on establishing expected baseline rates of mortality. Deaths in excess of these rates are then calculated--and attributed to the circulating influenza virus. In this way, groups at high risk of mortality have been defined as the elderly and those with chronic conditions. Special-risk groups, such as those in institutions, have also been identified. The quantification of morbidity has required different approaches, and here community and family studies have made major contributions. In contrast to mortality, morbidity is most pronounced in children and young adults, and the diseases, although self-limited, are often quite severe. Although the size of the outbreaks varies, influenza infection can be documented annually. Thus, each year must be considered an influenza year.\r"

  ".U": "87238683\r", 
  ".W": "A major component in the prevention and control of influenza should be the use of killed influenza vaccines. These vaccines became possible after the first discovery of human strains of influenza virus in the 1930s. The ensuing decades have seen marked improvement in the available inactivated vaccines. Current vaccines have excellent reliability and assured potency, and they contain the proper antigens to match the frequent changes in circulating influenza viruses. Killed vaccines work by inducing serum antibodies against the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the vaccine strains, with sufficient antibodies ensuring protection against infection. The antibody responses to current vaccines appear to be adequate in all age groups. Although antibody responses are depressed in patients receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressants, current vaccines do provide protection for most populations. Vaccines prevent the manifestations of disease by about 30 to 70 percent in all populations, and they reduce deaths in high-risk individuals by about 60 to 87 percent. Local adverse reactions to vaccine are quite common, but not severe. Fever, also somewhat common, usually does not last beyond 48 hours. Neurologic complications have not been observed since the use of the swine influenza vaccine of 1976. Killed vaccines should be given annually in the fall, but they can be given up to and during an outbreak. Target groups for vaccines have been defined by the Centers for Disease Control. In recent years, these groups have included physicians and nurses who give care to patients at risk for complications of influenza.\r"

  ".W": "Among the molecular maneuvers that enable the influenza virus to survive are antigenic variation and functional alterations. Two kinds of minor antigenic variations, producing new strains within type A virus subtypes, have been discovered: antigenic drift, in which the amino acid sequences of the antigens are changed; and antigenic camouflage, in which the antigens are glycosylated. Both kinds of variation are caused by mutations in the viral genome. These mutations produce slightly changed antigens, which many existing antibodies cannot recognize. Major antigenic variations (so-called antigenic shift) are produced by gene reassortment. Two subtypes, coinfecting a host, can reassort their eight ribonucleoprotein gene segments into as many as 256 different combinations. Such recombinations can produce new viruses with the potential for transmission in humans, but whose surface antigens are completely unmatched by antibodies in the population, permitting a pandemic to occur. Functional changes, caused by mutations, alter the interactions between the virus and the host, including virus binding to host receptor sites and fusion of viral and host membranes. All these mechanisms allow the influenza virus to survive in humans, probably perpetually.\r"

Antibody was measured by radioimmunoassay. The authors detected persistently elevated anticapsular antibody levels among more than one half of vaccinees who developed a significant rise in antibody 1 month following immunization one decade after administration of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine when these levels were compared to prevaccine levels for pneumococcal capsular types 4, 7F, and 8. This finding was not the case with pneumococcal types 1, 3, 12F, 14, and 19F; less than two fifths of vaccinees maintained increased levels of anticapsular antibody to these types one decade after administration of pneumococcal vaccine. Geometric mean anticapsular antibody levels for types 7F and 8 only were significantly higher one decade after vaccine administration compared with the levels before immunization (t-test, p less than 0.01).\r"

Studies of peritoneal fluid were rarely helpful and cell counts overlapped in the cases and controls. Spontaneous peritonitis is usually seen in patients with severe liver disease, but there are few distinctive symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings. The mortality rate is high, and it is uncertain from our data that antibiotic therapy alters this prognosis.\r"

The risk factors, natural course, optimal method of diagnosis, and optimal therapy of this complication are not well defined. One case of Legionella pneumophila lung abscess occurring in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is described, and the reports of 26 other cases are reviewed. This complication is usually hospital-acquired and occurs predominantly in transplant recipients and systemic lupus erythematosus patients treated with corticosteroids with or without a cytotoxic drug. The time interval between the onset of immunosuppressive therapy and infection is usually of several weeks. Progression from pneumonia to abscess formation may be rapid, more commonly within an upper lobe. Transthoracic aspiration within the abscess cavity may be diagnostic, thus obviating the need for open lung biopsy. The prompt institution of erythromycin 4 gm daily intravenously followed by oral therapy for at least 4 weeks is associated with a high survival rate. Adequate drainage from the abscess cavity must be maintained. Radiologic healing may be slow. Long-term survival without relapse does occur. That the clinical spectrum of Legionella pneumophila infection includes lung abscess has not been sufficiently emphasized. This agent should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of lung abscess.\r"

Predicted maximum oxygen consumption values were determined by using standard Bruce treadmill protocol during the first and third tests and the Astrand protocol for submaximal testing on a bicycle ergometer during the third trimester. Exercise prescriptions were given. The primiparous and multiparous subjects were randomized into control and exercise groups, differing only in the frequency of aerobic exercise. The results showed that exercise had no associated increase in neonatal morbidity and obstetric complications. All subjects improved or maintained their level of aerobic fitness. The exercisers showed a significant training effect. The disparity in the second test's results may suggest that the physiologic characteristics of pregnancy masked the aerobic improvement.\r"

The incidence of gestational onset diabetes in the selectively screened group (19/453, 4.2%) was twice that in the routinely screened group (21/1000, 2.1%). Evidence of glucose intolerance without a risk factor was found in only one case (1/1000, 0.1%) in the routinely screened group.

If the occurrence of severe shoulder dystocia, resulting in fetal asphyxia and trauma, could be accurately predicted from maternal risk factors, then a cesarean section would be indicated to prevent the poor outcome. The information available in the obstetric literature, however, is contradictory regarding whether shoulder dystocia can be predicted. In the present study, the patients at greatest risk of shoulder dystocia (all 394 mothers delivering neonates with birth weights greater than or equal to 4000 gm over a 2-year period) were examined. A three-way discriminant analysis was used to determine if a model could be developed that could effectively predict those patients who would be included in each of the groups of no shoulder dystocia, shoulder dystocia without trauma (29 patients), and shoulder dystocia with trauma (20 patients). Three factors, including birth weight, prolonged deceleration phase, and length of second stage labor, were found individually to contribute significantly to the classification. However, when examined in detail, it was noted that while 94% of cases with no shoulder dystocia would be detected, only 16% of the cases of shoulder dystocia with trauma would be predicted by this model. We conclude that in the group of pregnancies delivering neonates greater than or equal to 4000 gm, the occurrence of shoulder dystocia cannot be predicted from clinical characteristics or labor abnormalities, and that the occurrence of shoulder dystocia is not evidence of medical malpractice.\r"

These efforts resulted in a low (22.1%) postoperative distress catheterization rate with no complications if needling was done. Urinary infection rates ranged from less than 1% for patients who did not require distress catheterization to 3.9% for a comparative population of patients who had an indwelling catheter during and after operation.

  ".W": "In a clinical-pathologic review of 825 cases of endometrial carcinoma diagnosed between 1955 and 1984, 735 cases were confirmed as endometrial carcinoma. From this group 29 cases of clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium were found representing a 4% frequency. Clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium was found in an older group of women, all postmenopausal. No relationship to the use of estrogen could be demonstrated. The frequency of clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium dropped from 6% in the group diagnosed between 1955 and 1969 to 3% in the group diagnosed between 1970 and 1984, although the numbers of cases of endometrial cancer rose from 194 to 525 in the comparative time span. Clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium has a poorer prognosis, with a 64% 5-year survival rate compared with an 80% 5-year survival rate for adenocarcinoma, not otherwise stated. Three patients died after 5 years of disease. Treatment is still not satisfactory, but the proved therapy remains total abdominal hysterectomy plus salpingo-oophorectomy. The role of adjunctive therapy has not been established.\r"

This article describes the evolution of testing within the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center and encompasses a 15-year time period between 1971 and 1985. During this time approximately 200,000 patients were delivered of their infants. Fetal surveillance increased from less than 1% to current levels of 16% of patients. The antepartum fetal death rate was evaluated as a measure of evaluating the usefulness of antepartum testing. The fetal death rate after antepartum testing in selected high-risk patients was significantly less than that found in those patients not tested. The questions that might be raised regarding broader application of this technique and potential benefits are stated.\r"

  ".U": "87238778\r", 
  ".W": "Although osteoporosis is an age-related disorder, the accelerated bone loss observed in postmenopausal women may be preventable with early diagnosis and adequate estrogen replacement. In a prospective study, we investigated the effect of oral estrogen replacement using conjugated estrogens (Premarin, 0.625 mg) or micronized 17 beta-estradiol (Estrace, 1 mg) versus no estrogen in sequential single-photon bone density measurements over 3-year intervals in 397 postmenopausal women. Estradiol, 1 mg, and conjugated estrogens, 0.625 mg, were equally effective in regarding bone loss. The rate of bone loss was about the same for estrogen users regardless of age (51 to 80 years) and was approximately one third that of nonusers. Among nonusers a uniform accelerated rate of bone loss of 2.5% per year was noted between 56 and 70 years old, whereas between the ages of 51 and 55 years and after age 70 years, the rate of bone loss was significantly less. Ever users over age 65 years showed continued protection from bone loss as long as estrogen therapy was continued. Previous estrogen users who stopped estrogen after age 65 years lost bone more rapidly than women of similar age who had never taken estrogen. Thus to prevent accelerated bone loss in postmenopausal women, we recommend early and continued hormone replacement for life. Estrogen nonusers should be monitored at regular intervals to minimize accelerated bone loss.\r"

The medical records were reviewed for maternal age, amniocentesis indication, ultrasound findings, location of the placenta, location of the needle insertion (transplacental versus nontransplacental), color of the amniotic fluid, results of prenatal testing, complications of procedure, and pregnancy outcome. Complete follow-up data were possible for 308 subjects and obtained for 298 (96.8%). There were 11 miscarriages (3.6%), two stillbirths (0.7%), and one neonatal death (0.3%), resulting in a total postprocedural loss rate of 4.7% (14/298). If those patients with a preamniocentesis history of bleeding are eliminated, the total postprocedural rate of loss is 3.3% (7/211). Miscarriage within 2 weeks of amniocentesis occurred in 1.7% of procedures (5/298). No significant difference in pregnancy outcome was noted between transplacental and nontransplacental amniocentesis.\r"

This study of a series of patients managed over a 2-year period demonstrates the use of this technique in an ambulatory gynecologic practice. Results demonstrate this to be a very rapidly accomplished, effective procedure that is very well accepted by the patients. Results are generally available within 24 hours and permit both the physician and the patient to accurately predict the course of management. In addition, it allows the primary physician to accurately determine which patients will require in-hospital management and which may safely undergo ambulatory, office-based biopsy of solid lesions. Experience shows this to be a valuable diagnostic tool that can be safely utilized by the practicing gynecologist.\r"

The cyanoacrylate retinopexy did not prevent the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy with traction retinal detachment, but in three of the eyes the tissue adhesive continued to maintain retinal apposition to the retinal pigment epithelium at the retinotomy edge.

The first change detected after radiation was the focal loss of capillary endothelial cells and pericytes. As the areas of acellular capillaries became confluent, cotton-wool spots became visible ophthalmoscopically. These increased in number and then faded away, leaving large areas of retinal capillary perfusion. Histologic studies showed occlusion first of the deeper, smaller retinal vessels and then gradually of the larger vessels. Intraretinal neovascularization as well as apparent recanalization then developed, but no new vessels extended through the internal limiting lamina into the vitreous. Rubeosis iridis with neovascular glaucoma developed 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 years postirradiation, and vitreous aspirate demonstrated a high level of angiogenic factor.\r"

The sensitivity is further increased by about two orders of magnitude if high specific-activity 32P-labeled probe is used. This method of detection is more sensitive than histologic diagnosis, appears to be roughly comparable to that by virus isolation in culture, and should be applicable to the detection of other infectious agents.\r"

Mg-deficient rats were studied with no known seizures or immediately after audiogenic seizure-shock. Light microscopy of lung from Mg-deficient rats with audiogenic seizure-shock revealed atelectasis, generalized edema and hemorrhage, and pleural petechiae. Ultrastructural changes in lung alveoli of Mg-deficient rats with seizure-shock included gaps in capillary endothelium, swelling and separation of endothelial cells from the underlying basement membranes; Type I cell necrosis and separation from basement membranes; and intraalveolar red blood cells, fibrin, and precipitated plasma. The seizure-shock episode of acute Mg deficiency produces structural changes in the lung similar to changes produced by several forms of shock, early acute oxygen toxicity, and the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in human neonates.\r"

  ".W": "Cultures of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) tend to form loci with multilayered growth as \"hills\" or \"nodules,\" which is unusual for normal but common for transformed cells. Earlier it was shown that such nodules were composed of SMCs with the distinctive properties of small cell size, low adhesivity, and scarce or no fibronectin and filamentous actin, features which may also characterize tumor cells. Similar properties could be induced by cultivation of SMCs in aggregates, indicating modulation of SMCs to a distinct \"multilayered\" phenotype, rather than selection of variant SMCs with preference for multilayered growth. Transfer of SMCs to a three-dimensional arrangement by agglomeration to nodules, \"spheroids,\" by seeding of SMCs on low-adhesive substratum, like agarose, was followed by signs of SMC injury with focal autodigestion and with loss of material from the cells, which to some extent was deposited extracellularly, transition to foam cells with cholesterol accumulation mainly as cholesteryl esters, and eventually decrease in cell size. Identically treated fibroblasts showed similar, but much less pronounced, changes and were largely protected by whole blood serum, in contrast to SMCs. The results indicate that the \"multilayered\" SMC type can be conceived of as a postinjury phenotypic state which is preceded by overt cellular injury and transition to foam cells in conjunction with sudden transfer to three-dimensional arrangement in spheroids. It is suggested that similar modulation may be important in atherosclerosis, in which foam cell transition and deposition of debris are prominent changes.\r"

Homeostatic control of inflammation is accomplished in part by physiologic protease inhibitors. The authors investigated the effectiveness of a number of synthetic protease inhibitors in ameliorating the glomerular injury induced by immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in mice. Two amidine-type protease inhibitors, bis (5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane and 1,2-bis (5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)ethane, had the greatest effects. They caused a marked reduction in glomerular necrosis (P less than 0.001) but did not affect the amount or site of immune complex localization or leukocyte influx. The inhibition constants of the protease inhibitors against nine purified physiologic proteases were determined. These results were discussed in relation to the effectiveness of the protease inhibitors in reducing glomerular injury. This investigation indicates that the administration of synthetic protease inhibitors can have a beneficial effect on immune-mediated inflammatory injury.\r"

  ".W": "The histogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested a relationship to an unusual form of childhood neural tumor, often termed peripheral neuroepithelioma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Five Ewing's sarcoma tumor cell lines were studied for evidence of a neural phenotype. Under normal culture conditions, no morphologic evidence of neural differentiation was detected. Treatment with retinoic acid, an agent known to induce marked neural differentiation in neuroblastoma, had no demonstrable effect. Treatment with either cyclic AMP or TPA, in contrast, induced pronounced morphologic evidence of neural differentiation. Cells developed elongate processes with varicosities by phase-contrast microscopy; filaments, microtubules, and uraniffin-positive dense core granules were present by electron microscopy. Three neural markers (NSE, NFTP, and cholinesterase) were absent or barely detectable in untreated cells, but became abundant after treatment. These results provide convincing evidence for a neural histogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma. They also suggest a close relationship between Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neural tumors, including the chest wall tumor described by Askin, but only a distant relationship to neuroblastoma.\r"

All Cy-treated animals revealed the expected lymphoid depletion of spleen and lymph node B zones. Acute GPHLV infection of Cy-treated animals resulted in increased blood and spleen leukocyte viral infectivity titers and lymphoid tissue lesions containing cells positive for GPHLV antigen and intranuclear inclusions. During latent GPHLV infection, Cy treatment resulted in declining leukocyte viral infectivity titers without pathologic lesions. Morphologic data suggest that tissue histiocytic cells may be involved in the productive viral infection observed in Cy-immunosuppressed animals during acute GPHLV infection. During latency, however, infectious virus appears restricted to a Cy-sensitive, probably lymphoid, cell. This animal model appears useful for the study of lymphotropic viral infection during immunosuppression.\r"

  ".U": "87238851\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic administration of cyclosporin A (CyA) to animals and humans results in renal damage characterized by tubulointerstitial lesions and renal insufficiency. This nephrotoxicity limits the use of CyA in the management of graft rejection. Despite recent investigations in this area, relatively few studies correlate structural and functional abnormalities in animals undergoing long-term CyA treatment. The authors therefore treated 30 rats with CyA at the dose of 40 mg/kg/48 hr for up to 5 months. An additional group of 30 rats was given the vehicle alone and was considered as a control group. Renal morphology and function were studied. For evaluation of the effect of drug withdrawal, a third group of 25 animals received CyA for 3 months and was followed for another 2 additional months after drug withdrawal. The results show that the chronic administration of CyA to rats induced complex renal morphologic changes, associated with renal insufficiency, polyuria, and enhanced sodium excretion. Withdrawal of the drug resulted in almost complete normalization of morphologic and functional parameters. The early morphologic expression of CyA nephrotoxicity was isometric vacuolization and loss of brush border involving the proximal tubular cells, followed by a peculiar lesion in distal tubular cells due to glycogen accumulation. Glomerular and interstitial damage was mild and appeared only after 3 months of CyA administration. No vascular abnormalities were found in rats treated with CyA for 5 months. A CyA-induced decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) correlates with brush border loss but not with isometric vacuolization. The distal tubular glycogen accumulation was associated with the development of polyuria and enhanced sodium excretion. Given the high blood sugar level and severe glycosuria in animals treated chronically with CyA, it is also concluded that CyA possesses a diabetogenic effect which is likely to be responsible for glycogen accumulation at the tubular level.\r"

When sociodemographic variables, health beliefs, feeling of control over outcome, mood, sexual interest before the AIDS epidemic, and medical care utilization were correlated with decrease and/or increase in AIDS risk behaviors, the clusters of variables most strongly correlated with change in risk behaviors differed between the physicians and students. Interventions designed to change behaviors in AIDS high-risk groups should be tailored for specific subgroups.\r"

The identification of a probable anatomical route of entry is clinically relevant and an important clue for further investigations of the mechanism of phototherapy. However, patients' expectations nearly always predicted the outcome, leaving open the possibility that expectations were responsible for their responses.\r"

A sorting task used to establish whether other clinicians agreed on the classification of highly prototypical features into dimensions yielded satisfactory levels of agreement. A mail survey of a random sample of psychiatrists indicated that these dimensions possessed satisfactory content validity.\r"

Women received greater mean daily doses of antipsychotics than men (1688 versus 1284 mg). Using a Cox model survival analysis, the authors found no statistical association between length of stay and the mean daily dose of antipsychotic medication. The mean daily dose of high-potency agents was 2.7 times greater than the dose of low-potency agents. The excess exposure to haloperidol alone resulted in 16.3% of the overall neuroactive drug costs.\r"

Harsh attitude judgements were associated with the AIDS portrayals, as well as much less willingness to interact even in routine conversation when the patient's illness was identified as AIDS. Increasing numbers of AIDS patients will be seeking medical attention from physicians in all areas of the country and it will be important for health care professions to develop programs which counter unreasonable stigma and prejudicial attitudes that may be associated with this illness.\r"

Data on practice experiences reflect the increased incidence of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The proportion of practitioners in rural areas who evaluated possible cases (17 per cent), and counseled patients at risk (50 per cent) indicated the generalized nature of the problem. Compared to similar data obtained in 1984, levels of competency in diagnosing and counseling persons with AIDS-related disorders increased in Los Angeles. However, on a statewide basis, a majority of those interviewed lack the AIDS-related knowledge and skills required to carry out their roles in dealing with AIDS. Competency was associated with physicians' personal and professional characteristics and their level of discomfort in dealing with homosexuals.\r"

  ".W": "We used insurance claims from enrollees in the Rand Health Insurance Experiment to determine the amount of selected components of preventive care received by a representative sample of the non-aged population in the United States and to determine whether insurance coverage was an important determinant of that amount. Only 45 percent of infants received timely immunization for DPT and polio; 93 per cent received some well child care by 18 months of age. In the three-year experimental period, only 4 per cent of adults had a tetanus shot, 66 per cent of women aged 17-44 and 57 per cent aged 45-65 received a Pap smear, and 2 per cent of women aged 45-65 had a mammogram. Cost sharing was associated with even less preventive care: 60 per cent of children on the free plan and 49 per cent on cost sharing plans received preventive care of any type. For adults, women on the free plan received more preventive care of several kinds, and those aged 45-65 received more Pap smears than those on cost-sharing plans. Even with free care, most enrollees did not receive adequate preventive care. Thus, free care alone, while significant, is not a sufficient incentive to providing recommended levels of preventive care. The average per person insurance charge for increasing the amount of preventive care to a level consistent with that recommended would be $22 for a complete set of immunizations by age 18 months, $9 for a Pap smear every three years, and $97 for a Pap test and mammogram every three years.\r"

Smokers at two outpatient sites were assigned to one of three groups: provider intervention only (PI); provider intervention plus self-help manual (PI/M); and usual care (control) group (C). The physician message emphasized the patient's personal susceptibility, the physician's concern, and the patient's ability to quit (self-efficacy). The nurse consultation concentrated on benefits and barriers associated with stopping, and on strategies for cessation. Telephone interviews were conducted with the 250 participants within a few days of their clinic visit and again at one and six months. Both PI and PI/M proved to be superior to usual care in motivating attempts to quit at both one-month and six-month follow-ups, and logistic regression analyses indicated that participants receiving the self-help manual in addition to the health provider message were between two and three times more likely to quit smoking during the study period than were participants in either of the other study groups.\r"

Among those who reported such head injuries within the two weeks prior to interview, only 16 per cent were admitted to hospitals. Children, members of low-income families, and those injured at home, school, or in a recreational setting were less likely to be admitted to hospital than others. Among those who sustained a head injury in the previous three months and had some disability from that injury during the two weeks prior to interview, those not admitted to hospital included one-half of those with three to seven days of bed disability and one-third of those with more than seven days of bed disability; and they accounted for one-half of all disability days. These findings indicate that hospital-based head injury incidence data are incomplete and may contain substantial biases.\r"

A 93 per cent match rate resulted in a final study population of 9,411 pregnancies. A control population of like number was acquired by matching on key demographic characteristics. The majority of the results generally confirm the results of a 1980 Missouri study; WIC participation was associated with decreases in low birthweight (7.8 vs 9.2 per cent), prematurity (9.7 vs 12.0 per cent) and inadequate prenatal care (30.5 vs 31.7 per cent), and an increase in mean gestational age (39.9 vs 39.6 weeks). Low birthweight rates were lower for infants of WIC participants in each of the risk categories reviewed. As noted in the 1980 study, duration of WIC of at least seven months was needed before improvements in birthweight outcomes measures were noted.\r"

  ".U": "87239072\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1975 and 1982, the annual number of deaths attributable to pregnancy and childbirth, induced abortion, and contraception in the United States declined from 1,083 to 751. The mortality rates for each of these components decreased by 35,89, and 35 per cent, respectively, and the overall reproductive mortality rate dropped by 35 per cent. The death rate due to pregnancy and childbirth is 25 times greater than that due to induced abortion and eight times more than that to contraceptive-associated mortality. In 1982 nearly 30 million women used contraceptives, while slightly fewer than four million women were pregnant to term. The decrease in contraceptive-associated mortality between 1975 and 1982 probably reflects a combination of safer contraceptives, fewer women using contraceptive methods that may not be safest for them, and an increasing number of sterilizations, which remove women from the group at highest risk of contraceptive-related mortality. Maternal mortality appears to be slowing its rate of decline, while induced abortion mortality has been very low since the legalization of abortion.\r"

Results indicated perfect classification of smokers versus nonsmokers and acceptable reliability of repeated samples. Study II investigated the accuracy of saliva cotinine in detecting recent quitters in a worksite smoking cessation program. Saliva cotinine showed greater accuracy than expired carbon monoxide at detecting quitters, provided they were abstinent for at least seven days. From pre- to post-treatment, subject's saliva cotinine levels dropped 19 per cent while self-reported rate of smoking dropped 54 per cent. Saliva collection in the field is feasible and cotinine appears to be one of the more sensitive assays currently available for epidemiologic and clinical applications.\r"

For determination of the intrathoracic extent of a lesion, posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs should be followed by computerized tomography to evaluate the hila, mediastinum, pleura, and chest wall. Computerized tomographic examination of the chest should be extended to include the upper abdomen. The adrenal glands can be evaluated by such examination, but adequate examination of the liver requires both precontrast and postcontrast computerized tomography scans. The radiologic workup for assessing distant metastases to the liver, brain, or bone should be performed only when clinical and biochemical findings suggest such metastases. For detection of recurrent carcinoma following treatment, computerized tomograms of the chest are more sensitive than routine radiographs. Magnetic resonance imaging may prove useful in the future for initial staging and for differentiating posttreatment fibrosis from recurrent bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

In the last 125 patients, catheter technique through the superior thyroid artery was compared with the needle technique to evaluate quality of images, completeness of the study, number of exposures required, and complications from these two techniques. The needle technique resulted in complete visualization of the extracranial and intracranial circulations in 94 patients (94 percent). The catheter technique was similarly successful in 123 of 125 patients (98 percent). The proportions of complete visualization were not statistically different in the two groups (p = 0.16). Six patients (6 percent) in the needle technique group and three patients (2 percent) in the catheter technique group required multiple exposures. When the complications incurred by the two techniques were compared, there was no statistical difference between the two techniques (p = 0.39). Two complications occurred in the needle technique group (2 percent), one resulting in dissection and the other, extravasation. There were no complications in the catheter technique group. Due to technical ease of performance, the catheter technique is preferred, although statistical data did not reveal superiority of one technique over the other.\r"

In addition, the average cost for surgical revision was slightly less than that for transluminal angioplasty. Therefore, for long-term patency, surgical treatment is the method of choice, although under special circumstances there may still be a role for transluminal angioplasty.\r"

On the basis of physical findings, patients underwent either immediate laparotomy or close observation with frequent reexaminations and operation only if signs changed. The reliability of physical examination and the safety of nonoperative treatment in the absence of peritoneal signs were assessed. The overall incidence of major damage, including damage to the diaphragm, was 59.1 percent. Significant intraperitoneal visceral injury was found in 45.7 percent of patients with transabdominal stab wounds and in 25 percent of those with transthoracic stab wounds. Physical examination correctly predicted the findings in 90 to 96 percent of patients at initial assessment, with a sensitivity of 88.4 percent and a specificity of 93.9 percent. As delayed laparotomy after a change in signs during observation did not increase morbidity or hospital stay, and the unnecessary laparotomy rate in this study was 5.9 percent, we recommend a policy of selective management of abdominal and thoracic stab wounds with omental evisceration or other evidence of peritoneal penetration. Local wound care with amputation of the protruded omentum followed by close observation and monitoring of vital signs is safe surgical practice when no peritoneal signs or other indication for urgent exploration are present on admission.\r"

This finding, in combination with the unsatisfactory results of simple incision and healing by granulation and the character of relapses, suggests improper initial operation and multifactorial causes.

Its important features are mobilization of the duodenum, the use of irrigation, and the possibility of practicing the removal of calculi under visual control. We stress that the use of the choledochoscope is important to reduce the incidence of retained stones after common bile duct explorations.\r"

The Magill system and a demand valve breathing system were both studied with tidal and vital capacity breathing. Rapid pre-oxygenation was possible with the demand valve system but the technique was associated with air leaks around the mask. Vital capacity breathing with the Magill system was inefficient in practice because of rebreathing and air leaks, and the recently proposed four vital capacity breath technique provided suboptimal alveolar oxygenation in pregnant subjects. Oxygenation in pregnant subjects was significantly faster than in nonpregnant controls and was achieved after just 2 minutes of tidal breathing from a standard Magill system with a prefilled reservoir. Care was necessary to ensure a gas-tight seal around the facemask.\r"

However, the efficacy of the epidural analgesia was maintained by using the same volume for the loading dose. The mean onset of analgesia was delayed from 9.1 to 13.6 minutes. There were fewer calls for intervention consequent upon the reduction in adverse effects. The use of 8 ml 0.08% bupivacaine for the loading dose or for subsequent top-ups is recommended.

The infusion rate was adjusted until the first twitch of the train was below 20% of control and then run at a constant rate. There was a marked variation in the dose of vecuronium administered (0.01-0.065 mg/kg/hour [corrected]). Two patients, who appeared to be most sensitive to the drug, were both receiving metronidazole. Recovery of neuromuscular function was extremely prolonged and widely variable (6-37 hours) on stopping the infusion. No adverse cardiovascular effects or evidence of histamine release were seen as a result of administration of the drug. Vecuronium is probably more suitable for administration in bolus doses rather than by infusion in patients with renal and respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilatory sensitivity to carbon dioxide was measured in six healthy volunteers before, and at various times up to 20 hours after, administration of epidural buprenorphine 0.15 mg with a modified Read rebreathing technique. The carbon dioxide response curves were depressed in a time-dependent, prolonged and biphasic manner. Significant depression was seen in the intercept values at an end tidal carbon dioxide of 7.2 kPa, for mouth occlusion pressure (p less than 0.01), tidal volume (p less than 0.05) and minute ventilation (p less than 0.05). A significant reduction of slope was obtained only for minute ventilation. Linear regression of respiratory rate changes during carbon dioxide stimulation, did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, these data indicate that epidural buprenorphine, despite a high lipid solubility, causes respiratory depression to the same extent as epidural morphine. Surveillance of patients who receive epidural buprenorphine for postoperative pain relief is necessary.\r"

Results in this group of patients showed that there was no longer any need to sterilise breathing systems or decontaminate ventilators if these filters were used. They also performed satisfactorily as a heat and moisture exchanger in patients in need of long-term ventilation, and their use appears to offer substantial advantages as regards cost, ease of use and patient safety.\r"

There is a correlation between the degree of difficulty and the anatomy of the oropharynx in the same patient. The study was initially on obstetric patients but was extended to nonobstetric surgical patients in order to increase the number of cases investigated. The incidence of failed intubations in the obstetric group over a 3-year period was seven out of 1980 cases, whereas in the surgical group the results were six out of 13,380 patients. Any screening test which adds to our ability to predict difficulty in intubation must be welcomed, as failure to intubate can potentially lead to fatality.\r"

Low-dose intrathecal morphine provides a level of analgesia during operation indistinguishable from that of moderate doses of parenteral opiate, but is no more effective in attenuating autonomic responses to the procedure. Analgesia is prolonged into the postoperative period, does not cause clinically evident respiratory depression and can be enhanced by small doses of intravenous opiate. The principal advantage of intrathecal morphine is the avoidance of irregular and inadequate pain relief in the early, and most painful, part of the postoperative period. Low-dose intrathecal morphine appears safe, effective and feasible in aortic aneurysm surgery and provides an alternative to traditional management with parenteral opiates.\r"

These findings indicate that after cardiopulmonary bypass, when right ventricular dysfunction with raised pulmonary vascular resistance may occur, selective reduction of right ventricular afterload with isosorbide dinitrate may prove beneficial.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred gynaecological patients for laparoscopy divided into five groups were studied to determine the effects of a number of pretreatments on serum myoglobin, creatinine kinase and myalgia following intermittent suxamethonium administration. One group acted as controls, while the other groups were given intravenous pretreatments of alcuronium 2 mg, midazolam 0.15 mg/kg, lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 7 mg. Serum myoglobin was determined by radio-immunoassay. The mean increases in the control group were 167 micrograms/litre myoglobin at 20 minutes and 196 IU creatinine kinase at 24 hours; 13 out of 20 patients responded with a marked increase of serum myoglobin at 20 minutes and of creatinine kinase at 24 hours. Only alcuronium pretreatment prevented myoglobin increase at 20 minutes, abolished creatinine kinase increase at 24 hours and reduced 24-hour myalgia. The other pretreatments slightly reduced myoglobin increase at 20 minutes and 24-hour creatinine kinase but did not reduce myalgia. Only one patient in the whole study had markedly elevated serum myoglobin at 24 hours. We conclude that only non-depolarising relaxant pretreatment is effective in the reduction of some of the adverse effects of suxamethonium administration.\r"

Prolonged and profound neuromuscular block persisted despite haemodialysis (5 hours on each of 3 days) followed by 72 hours of continuous haemofiltration; it appeared to resolve only after plasma exchange (4 litres). The total of persistent block, for 9 days after the infusion had been stopped, is thought to be the longest period ever reported after administration of alcuronium. Neuromuscular block was monitored throughout this period using the train-of-four twitch technique. The potentiating effects of concurrent aminoglycoside therapy and hepatic dysfunction on the degree of paralysis are discussed.\r"
