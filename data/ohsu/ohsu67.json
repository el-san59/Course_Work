  ".W": "Sodium intake of infants varies widely with the type of food consumed. However, few reports are available describing the nutrients, including sodium values, of dietary intakes of infants receiving supplemental foods. The purpose of this study was to determine the sodium, energy, and nutrient values of diets for infants from low-income families participating in the WIC program. The sample consisted of 306 infants, aged 4 through 7 months, who were seen in well-child clinics. Approximately 200 of the infants were reportedly fed commercially prepared baby food as the only solid food; 55 received 50% or more of their energy from table foods. The dietary intakes of infants receiving supplemental foods and consuming commercially prepared baby foods included significantly less sodium than the intakes of infants fed primarily table foods. As a group, all infants met the RDAs for most nutrients but had higher sodium values than reported by other researchers. The group of infants for whom consumption of table foods was reported had values above the acceptable range for sodium primarily because the caregivers failed to provide low-sodium, nutrient-dense, supplemental foods in the quantities prescribed but instead substituted sodium-dense meat and vegetable products.\r"

  ".W": "A national telephone interview survey of an age-stratified random sample of 2,991 adults, aged 16 and over, provided detailed information from 1,142 vitamin and mineral supplement users about their nutrient intake patterns from dietary supplements. Dietary supplement users were divided into four groups (Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Very Heavy) on the basis of the type and amount of nutrient intake from supplements. The Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Very Heavy nutrient intake groups accounted for 42%, 16%, 28%, and 14%, respectively, of the total users. Young supplement users (aged 16 to 25) tended to be in the Light user group. Older adults (aged 41 to 64) and residents of the western United States tended to be in the Heavy and Very Heavy user groups. Users in the Light and Moderate nutrient intake groups generally used only one broad-spectrum vitamin and mineral product. Users in the Heavy and Very Heavy groups were typically taking two or more specialized vitamin and mineral products at a time as part of a personalized supplement regimen. Heavy and Very Heavy nutrient intakes were associated with more frequent visits to health food stores, greater nutrition activity, and less physician involvement. Light and Moderate nutrient intakes were more likely to be associated with a defensive interest in avoiding nutritional deficiencies. The implications of generally different motivations for dietary supplement use are discussed in the context of public information strategies.\r"

As a result, a late tray distribution and control system was implemented, and Food and Nutrition Services has assumed responsibility for serving late trays directly to patients' bedsides. This has resulted in the reduction of disputes with nursing personnel regarding \"lost\" trays. Unreported patient meal distribution changes were researched for each patient unit as meals were served. A system was implemented to document and control unreported distribution changes. Unreported changes for the noon and evening meals have virtually been eliminated. The outcome of the collaborative effort has been a redesigned patient meal distribution system, improved communication with Nursing Services and Administration, and reduced distribution problems.\r"

Sixty-two men aged 58 to 91 years (mean, 74.3 years) were vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in the fall of 1983. Serum hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibody titers were measured at various times up to 24 weeks postvaccination. Seroconversion frequencies determined at single times after vaccination were 28 to 46% of subjects, whereas cumulative seroconversion frequencies were greater than or equal to 70%. Eighteen to 28% of seroconversions occurred later than four weeks, and greater than or equal to 68% of those who seroconverted experienced greater than four-fold declines in peak HAI antibody titers by 24 weeks after vaccination. Consequently, 31 to 73% of subjects had HAI antibody titers greater than 40 throughout the study period. Measurement of HAI antibody titers at only one time after vaccination may not adequately reflect the immune response of this population or the degree of protection maintained through the influenza season.\r"

Severe disability resulting from stroke was defined as patients who were unable to dress, take care of their toilet needs, and feed themselves without assistance, or who required a wheel chair for ambulation three months after the most recent episode. During 20 years of follow-up 255 stroke patients were observed among the sample population. The annual incidence of stroke per thousand was 9.8, and rate of severe disability was 2.8 for men and 6.4 and 2.0 for women, respectively. Of the 74 cases with severe disability, approximately 92% were attributed to cerebral infarction. Related factors to severe disability due to cerebral infarction were recurrent attacks, hypertension, changes in ocular fundi and diabetes mellitus among predispositions and quadriplegia or muscular contraction, and intelligent or mental disorders among inhibiting factors for functional recovery. Furthermore, in 59 autopsy cases with multiple cerebral infarctions, the frequency of disability increased as the number of infarcts increased. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as risk factors for cerebral infarction and factors inhibiting post-ictal functional recovery were discussed.\r"

Compared to physicians aged 35 to 54 years, elderly physicians devoted a larger proportion of their practices to the care of elderly patients. In caring for these patients, elderly physicians spent more time per visit than did younger physicians and were more likely to conduct general examinations and provide counseling. In contrast, elderly physicians were less likely to perform mental status or vision examinations. Elderly physicians were also less likely to provide telephone follow-up for those patients greater than or equal to 75 years of age and more likely to discharge patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age without any specific follow-up planned. These data suggest that the content of care for elderly patients may differ substantially depending upon the physician's age.\r"

We are conducting five simultaneous clinical studies in a 725-bed nursing home. Utilizing a systematic subject recruitment methodology designed to minimize patient and staff burden, we have recruited over 100 subjects. The average recruitment rate over two years from nursing home residents meeting study entry criteria was 43%. The rate was highest (81%) for a study of urinary incontinence offering direct benefit to participants, and lowest (28% and 14% respectively) for physiologic studies of vasopressin regulation and dermal vitamin D production, offering no direct benefit. Studies of syncope and dementia which benefitted groups affected by these problems but not controls, had intermediate recruitment rates (46 and 44%, respectively, P less than .002 compared to incontinence). Thus, clinically relevant projects, sensitive to the needs of the patient and institution, can recruit subjects from the nursing home.\r"

Nineteen of these patients had no other symptoms and were hematologically normal. The B12 binding proteins, transcobalamins (TC) I, II, and III were quantitated employing QUSO and DEAE cellulose batch separations. The total number of TC II binding/affinity sites for B12 were elevated in both the normal and low B12 elderly groups. About 17% of the total serum B12 was carried by TC II in the control group while only 4% of the total was carried on TC II in both the normal and low B12 elderly. This was accompanied by an increase in unsaturation in TC II for these two groups. The findings suggest that an alteration in the TC II-B12 delivery system has occurred in the elderly.\r"

Twelve per cent of participants were anemic overall, although there was a sex difference; more males (17.7%) were anemic than females (8.4%). Mean Hgb levels did not change significantly with age group except in males over 85 years of age. Pearson Correlation Coefficients were small for age versus Hgb in females (-0.10) as well as in males (-0.21). Likewise, linear regression slopes were small for females (-0.01) and males (-0.04). Based on this set of data, one would not expect a change in Hgb with advancing age in healthy elderly patients.\r"

Forty-eight of 79 subjects (61%) fell during their first year of residence. Fourteen fallers suffered a serious injury. Among fallers, subjects with lower extremity weakness were more likely to be injured than were fallers without weakness (42 versus 12% injured). On the other hand, injured fallers needed less help than noninjured fallers (14% needed help with at least 2 activities of daily living versus 35%), and were less likely to be depressed than were noninjured fallers (7 versus 38%). Although frequently associated with falling, no injury occurred while rising from a chair. The contribution of environmental hazards was not well defined. The only acute factor distinguishing noninjurious from injurious falls was a recent previous fall (present in 30% of the former and 0% of the latter). The finding that injured fallers tend to be more independent, yet have greater lower extremity weakness, than noninjured fallers suggests that both components of injury, namely force of impact and protective responses of the faller, may contribute to likelihood of injury during a fall. This study suggests that if predictive characteristics of the injury-prone faller, or the fall, can be identified, preventive strategies could be targeted at the high risk group.\r"

The Court also refused to compel the hospital in this case to terminate the treatment, but permitted other hospitals to comply with the patient's wishes. We are publishing the amicus curiae brief filed by the Society for the Right to Die, Inc. in the Brophy case. Our purpose in doing this is to stimulate further discussion of the issue of the role of the patients who become incompetent, a matter of major concern to geriatric specialists. This brief has been well-prepared. It contains a legal and ethical history of considerable merit. It has not, however, been endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). Some of the principles the AGS has endorsed can be found on its own brief filed in the Conroy case (published in the December 1984 issue of the Journal). Physicians and medical ethicists in particular may wish to consider the caveats noted by David Thomasma, PhD. in his editorial in this issue of the Journal. We invite further discussion.\r"

Since there is no national standard for back-up policies for emergency departments, emergency medicine has a responsibility to examine this question in order to arrive at some possible solutions. In addition, emergency department directors have an obligation to consider their particular staffing and usage patterns in order to try to devise the most efficient back-up policy prior to need. Finally, assessment of the success with which such back-up policies are used is discussed.\r"

We also examined the effect of supplemental oxygen upon these factors. Baseline and peak drop in SaO2 after completion of the first bronchodilator therapy were measured and the percent change in SaO2 was calculated. A total of 47 patient visits were studied; 10 patients received supplemental oxygen. Mean age was 38 +/- 17.9 years. Baseline was SaO2 = 94.6 +/- 2.9%, peak drop SaO2 = 91.4 +/- 3.4%, and percent change in SaO2 = -3.4 +/- 2.5%. The mean time to peak drop was 24.4 +/- 15.4 minutes in the 40 patients, with an observed drop after initial treatment. The absolute change in SaO2 from baseline was significant both with and without oxygen (P less than .05 and less than .01, respectively). The group receiving oxygen had a significantly smaller percent drop and a larger proportion of patients showing no drop in SaO2 (P less than 0.01 and less than 0.03, respectively). Clinically significant oxygen desaturation can occur within 30 minutes of inhaled bronchodilator therapy. Supplemental oxygen (2-3 L/min) helps blunt the metaproterenol-induced drop in SaO2.\r"

  ".U": "87223987\r", 
  ".W": "We have presented evidence in a previous paper that the development of prothymocytes, pre-B cells, and TdT+ lymphoid precursor cells in the bone marrow of motheaten (me/me) and viable motheaten (mev/mev) mice is defective. In the present study, we have used a selective culture system that supports the generation of rat- and mouse-origin TdT+ bone marrow lymphoid cells in vitro to further investigate the early stages of lymphopoiesis in me/me and mev/mev mice. The results demonstrate that bone marrow stromal cell feeder layers derived from me/me and mev/mev mice do not support the growth of rat TdT+ cells in vitro, whereas stromal cell feeder layers from heterozygous (+/-) littermates and wild type (+/+) control mice do. Moreover, composite feeder layers formed by mixing as few as one part me/me and mev/mev bone marrow cells with 7 to 9 parts +/- littermate bone marrow cells also fail to effectively support the generation of TdT+ cells in vitro. In contrast to me/me and mev/mev mice, other mutant mouse models of autoimmune (NZB, NZB/W), immunodeficient (nu/nu), and hemopoietic (W/Wv, Sl/Sld) disorders form feeder layers that support normal to elevated levels of TdT+ cell growth in vitro. Thus, to date, only the me/me and mev/mev mutant mice have been found to lack the appropriate microenvironment for the generation of TdT+ bone marrow cells. Histologic analysis of the stromal cell feeder layers that are formed in our culture system shows that multilayered cellular patches, which normally are the most active sites of TdT+ cell development in vitro, are absent in feeder layers of me/me and mev/mev cells. Moreover, feeder layers from mev/mev mice contain a population of MAC 1+, basophilic, nonvacuolated, macrophage-like cells; whereas feeder layers from control mice contain MAC 1+, eosinophilic, vacuolated macrophage-like cells. Stromal cell feeder layers formed by mixtures of me/me or mev/mev and control mouse bone marrow cells contain numerous multilayered cellular patches and vacuolated mononuclear cells, but also contain large numbers of basophilic mononuclear cells. These composite feeder layers have a disproportionately reduced capacity to support the generation of TdT+ cells in vitro. Although the stromal microenvironment of me/me and mev/mev bone marrow does not support the growth of TdT+ cells in vivo or in vitro, the bone marrow from these mutant mice contains detectable numbers of pre-TdT+ cells. Thus, when cultured on normal mouse feeder layers, mutant mouse bone marrow rapidly generates TdT+ cells in vitro, albeit at significantly reduced levels as compared to +/- littermate controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Mice immunized with complexes formed in antigen excess developed a PnC-specific antibody response that was equivalent to that in mice injected with free antigen. On the other hand, mice injected with complexes formed in antibody excess developed very little PnC-specific antibody. Furthermore, administration of immune complexes (formed in antibody excess) resulted in suppression of the response to an immunogenic dose of PnC given concurrently or 1 day after injection of immune complexes but not when the antigen was given 1 day before injection of the immune complexes. Injections of free antibody (TEPC-15) also resulted in suppression of the response to antigenic challenge; however, suppression was greatest when the antibody was injected concurrently with the antigen, suggesting that the suppression was mediated through the formation of immune complexes in vivo. The suppression appears to be specific for the antigen (PnC), since in mice injected with TEPC-15/PnC complexes (formed in antibody excess) and challenged with PnC coupled to sheep RBC, only the response to PnC was suppressed.\r"

  ".U": "87224001\r", 
  ".W": "The T suppressor (Ts) cell response in contact sensitivity is preferentially inhibited by murine interferon-alpha, beta (IFN-alpha, beta) in vivo. Previous studies in vivo have suggested that IFN exerts its effect directly on the Ts subpopulation rather than through an effect on antigen-presenting macrophages. Nevertheless, the mechanism of this selective blockade remained unclear. To better define the mechanism(s) of inhibition of suppression by IFN-alpha, beta, we determined whether IFN acted on lymphocytes, macrophages, or both. Antigen-specific T effector cells of delayed-type hypersensitivity (TDH) and Ts cells were induced in vitro by co-culture of spleen lymphocytes with bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting macrophages (BM-MA) pulse-labeled with 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonate (DNBSO3). TDH or Ts activity was demonstrated by transfer of the lymphocytes into naive recipient BALB/c mice after 3 days of culture. BM-MA cultured for 5 to 7 days (BM-MA d5-7) before labeling preferentially activated TDH cells (Thy-1+, Lyt-1+2-); 10- to 14-day-old BM-MA (BM-MA d10) induced Ts cells (Thy-1+, Lyt-2+), as previously shown. Treatment of the spleen lymphocyte suspension with pure mouse IFN-alpha, beta at a dose of 10(3) U/10(8) cells completely blocked the induction of Ts cells but had no effect on the induction of TDH cells. Pretreatment of the antigen-presenting BM-MA for 24 hr with IFN (10(2) U/3 X 10(5) cells) had no effect on the induction of Ts and TDH cells. Cultivation of lymphocytes on a DNP-BM-MA d6 monolayer did not result in the induction of Ts cells; however, in the presence of a goat anti-murine IFN-alpha, beta antibody, Ts cells were induced. This finding indicates that the spontaneous release of IFN-alpha, beta in those cultures prevented the induction of Ts cells. These results confirm our previous observation that Ts cells are more easily blocked by IFN-alpha, beta than TDH cells, and demonstrate that IFN affects the Ts subpopulation not via modulation of the antigen-presenting macrophages. IFN-alpha, beta-producing, antigen-presenting, or accessory cells may therefore prevent the activation of this type of Ts cell.\r"

The anti-SRBC PFC from mice immunized with 5 X 10(7) SRBC was markedly increased by daily s.c. injections of epinephrine. The enhancement of PFC by epinephrine was completely blocked by preadministration with propranolol and hexamethonium, but not with phentolamine. The PFC was increased by osmotic and physical stimuli given once a day for 4 days after immunization with SRBC. The enhancement of PFC by these stimuli was completely blocked by preadministration with propranolol and hexamethonium. The enhancement of PFC by physical stimuli was observed in nonimmunized mice when spleen cells from stimulated mice were cultured with SRBC in vitro. In normal mice, the enhancement of PFC was observed 2 hr after one physical stimulation. However, spleen cells from mice given two physical stimuli did not show the enhancement of PFC after treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 antibody and complement, nor after removal of nonadherent cells. Next, the serum obtained from mice 30 to 60 min after a physical stimulation enhanced PFC of normal mice spleen cells in vitro, but the enhancement was abolished by the addition of propranolol. The enhancement of anti-SRBC PFC by s.c. injection of epinephrine suggested that the autonomic nervous system, especially the sympathetic nervous system, was activated by a local stimulus effect of the injection. This enhancement of anti-SRBC PFC appear to be due to the activation of antigen non-specific helper T lymphocytes by the beta-actin of endogenous catecholamines from the adrenal gland.\r"

We suggest that under certain conditions MC may serve as immune effector cells in glomerulonephritis. Immune complex (IC) deposits are a hallmark of glomerulonephritis. Because IC elicit oxygen radicals from other cell types and because oxygen radicals can induce glomerular injury, we measured release of O2- by cultured rat MC in response to IC and, in separate experiments, the binding of IC to MC. Soluble and insoluble IC markedly stimulated dose- and time-dependent, saturable O2- release. Specific antibody (Ab) alone or mixtures of nonimmune Ab and antigen had no significant effect. IC-induced O2- release was not affected by cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of phagocytosis. Binding studies with radioiodinated IC demonstrated specific binding with an affinity of 1.56 X 10(6) M-1 and 1.02 X 10(5) receptors per cell. Both binding and O2- release required the Fc region of Ab. IC formed with F(ab')2 fragments did not bind specifically to or stimulate O2- release by MC. Cultured cells from rats depleted of bone marrow-derived phagocytes by irradiation produced amounts of O2- similar to cells from normal rats. These results provide evidence that IC affect the biology of the contractile glomerular MC in a manner that is dependent on the Fc region of Ab and suggest that MC structure and function may be altered at sites of injury.\r"

On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, MCP migrates as a doublet with an Mr of the upper band of 63,000 and the lower band of 58,000. The same pattern was found on all cell populations in a given individual and was stable over time. In order to further characterize the two band pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, MCP was isolated by affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation from 72 healthy unrelated donors. All individuals expressed both bands and, based on the densitometric scanning of gels, three patterns were noted: upper band predominant in 65%, approximately equal distribution of upper and lower bands in 29%, and lower band predominant in 6%. These observed phenotypic frequencies fit with expectations based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a two-allele system. Family studies also support this model as none of the 26 offspring had a phenotype that deviated from the expected, assuming an autosomal codominant model of inheritance. These results are consistent with a simple two-allele system that controls the expression of the two bands of MCP.\r"

Each of these antibodies has been found to compete with the granulocyte C5a receptor for binding site(s) on the C5a polypeptide. Exploration of the antigenic topography of C5a revealed that the immunodominant portion of this glycopolypeptide resides between residues Lys20 and Arg37, with the area surrounding Cys27 being particularly important. In addition, a specific C5a derived tryptic peptide containing these amino acid residues competes with 125I-C5a for binding to the receptor. These observations are consistent with previously published data and suggest that this area of the C5a molecule is an important part of the receptor \"recognition domain\", and thus plays a critical role in the C5a receptor interaction.\r"

  ".U": "87224034\r", 
  ".W": "We reported previously that the Thy-1 antigen was released from murine thymocytes and thymoma cells by S. aureus-derived phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). It is therefore part of a small group of proteins known to use a unique form of membrane attachment. This finding has now been extended in studies with peripheral lymphocytes and additional leukocyte markers. Retention of viability and responsiveness to LPS were excellent in PI-PLC-treated spleen cells and there was no appreciable effect on lectin-binding surface glycoproteins. Thy-1 regeneration was insignificant on unstimulated spleen cells within 24 hr of treatment, but nearly complete at this time with a continuously dividing cell line. In contrast to the result with LPS, responses to the mitogens Con A, PHA, and PWM were virtually eliminated. Of more than 40 monoclonal antibodies tested, only staining with ThB and particular Qa specificities were diminished by PI-PLC treatment. The latter included Qa-2, Qa-4, Qa-5, and possibly also Qa-6, whereas Qa-1, TLa, and other class I and class II histocompatibility antigens were unaffected. Although the validity of the Qa results seems assured by the total PI-PLC resistance of many other lymphocyte antigens, the pattern of release was notably different from that observed with Thy-1 and ThB. That is, the density of Qa-2 was usually unchanged on a subpopulation of Qa-2-positive cells. This raises interesting questions about lymphocyte heterogeneity and flexibility in the use of this form of surface protein anchoring. Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins may be functionally significant in immunological responses, and this experimental approach should continue to be valuable for their identification and characterization.\r"

  ".W": "Human peripheral blood monocytes ingest particulate activators and generate leukotrienes via a trypsin-sensitive, beta-glucan-inhibitable receptor. The incubation of monolayers of monocytes with from 4 X 10(5) to 2 X 10(8) zymosan or glucan particles resulted in a dose-dependent release of up to 9% +/- 1.9 and 17.8% +/- 5.3 (mean +/- SD, n = 3) of the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetylglucosaminidase, into the culture medium. Lysosomal enzyme release occurred throughout the 2-hr period studied, with the greatest rate of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase release occurring during the first hour; the presence of 5 micrograms/ml of cytochalasin B accelerated this process when zymosan was the agonist. The preincubation of monocytes with from 0.5 to 500 micrograms/ml of soluble yeast beta-glucan inhibited N-acetylglucosaminidase release by 4 X 10(7) zymosan and glucan particles in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition occurring with 50 micrograms/ml of soluble yeast beta-glucan (mean +/- SD, n = 3). Preincubation with as much as 5 mg/ml of yeast mannan had no inhibitory effect on N-acetylglucosaminidase release. The pretreatment for 30 min of monolayers of monocytes with 50 micrograms/ml of affinity-purified trypsin, which selectively inactivates the monocyte-phagocytic response to particulate activators, also fully inhibited lysosomal enzyme release induced by zymosan and glucan particles. The inhibitory effects of a soluble ligand, yeast beta-glucan, and of trypsin pretreatment on lysosomal enzyme release correspond to the inhibitory effect of these agents on monocyte phagocytosis of zymosan and glucan particles and thus indicates ligand specificity for the beta-glucan receptor in the release of stored intracellular mediators.\r"

  ".W": "Opiate addiction and stress have been associated with altered immune responses. In this study, we evaluated the influence of morphine and the stress responsive opioid peptide beta-endorphin (beta-END) on O-2 and H2O2 production by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Exposure of these cells during 48 hr of culture to morphine and beta-END at pharmacologically (10(-8) M) and physiologically (10(-12) M) relevant concentrations, respectively, markedly suppressed peripheral blood mononuclear cell O-2 and H2O2 release in response to the respiratory burst stimuli opsonized zymosan and phorbol myristate acetate. Both opioids also induced a minimal, but statistically significant, increase in resting O-2 and H2O2 generation. The modulatory effects of morphine and beta-END on peripheral blood mononuclear cell oxygen metabolism appeared to involve a classical opioid receptor, because opioid activity was blocked by naloxone and was not observed with N-acetylated-beta-END. Using purified lymphocyte and monocyte preparations, we determined that although opioids directly increase monocyte-resting oxygen metabolism, lymphocytes are the primary target cell in opioid-mediated suppression of monocyte respiratory burst activity. The release of a suppressive product from opioid-triggered lymphocytes was inhibited by cyclosporine. Based on the results of this study, we propose that opioid-mediated suppression of mononuclear phagocyte respiratory burst activity is another factor to be considered in the immunodeficiency of opiate addiction and stress.\r"

The former pattern corresponded precisely to the reactivity of monoclonal antibody SFR20-DQ alpha 5, shown by Western blotting to react with isolated alpha-chains, but not with beta-chains. Additional variants of the DQ alpha genes were identified by using a locus-specific oligonucleotide probe for the DQ alpha gene, indicating differences among the DQ alpha 5-negative set of alleles. This analysis defines a set of DQ alpha allelic markers that are distinct from the well-established DQ serologic specificities DQw1, 2, 3 or \"blank.\" Although most DQ alpha 5+ cells carry the DRw52 specificity associated with the DR beta 2 gene, analysis of DQ alpha polymorphisms on DR5, DQw1; DR8, DQw1; and DRw13, DQw1 cells verified that this DQ alpha family of alleles was not invariably linked to the DR beta 2 locus.\r"

  ".W": "Uterine and vaginal secretions collected from intact adult female rats were analyzed to determine whether immunization at sites distal to the reproductive tract had any effect on the presence of specific IgA and IgG antibodies in genital tract secretions. Peyer's patch and i.p. immunization and boost with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) stimulated the appearance of specific IgA antibodies in uterine and vaginal secretions of uterine-ligated animals. IgG antibodies were also induced in uterine but not in vaginal secretions. In contrast, subcutaneous immunization and boost elicited a weak IgA uterine and IgG vaginal response. To establish the role of estradiol in regulating the presence of specific antibodies in the female genital tract, ovariectomized rats received primary and/or secondary Peyer's patch immunizations with hormone treatment. Administration of estradiol daily for 3 days before sacrifice resulted in a significant accumulation of IgA and IgG antibodies to SRBC in uterine secretions. In the absence of estradiol, antibody content was negligible. Vaginal antibody levels were also clearly influenced by estradiol. In contrast to the uterus, however, specific IgA and IgG antibodies were present in the vaginal secretions of saline-injected immunized animals and were markedly inhibited in animals treated with estradiol. These results indicate that antibodies in genital tract secretions can be induced by immunization of the Peyer's patches and that their presence in uterine secretions is clearly dependent on estradiol. Further, they indicate that gut-derived specific antibodies enter the vagina in the absence of hormone stimulation and that estradiol exerts an inhibitory effect on their presence in vaginal secretions.\r"

Kinetic analysis allowed evaluation of the four rate constants governing both complement- and Fc-mediated clearance processes. This analysis revealed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis had significantly reduced values for the constants regulating complement-dependent clearance (p less than 0.001). Complement-mediated clearance dysfunction was associated with normal serum complement levels and normal Fc receptor function. These data indicate that complement-mediated clearance defects are neither the simple result of a hypocomplementemic complement opsonization deficiency nor merely the reflection of profound Fc dysfunction. Defects in the two clearance processes can occur independently. These data demonstrate a specific complement receptor defect in the fixed tissue macrophages of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".U": "87224076\r", 
  ".W": "During an attempt to isolate shrimp allergens, evidence was obtained that shrimp ribonucleic acid was capable of eliciting a specific IgE response in man and an experimental animal model system. The shrimp ribonucleic acid was extracted from boiled whole shrimp (Peneaus indicus), and was isolated by salt precipitation and sequential chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel and BioGel P-100. The allergenic material was identified as a ribonucleic acid based on the following criteria: a maximal absorption at 258 nm, failure to stain positively with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on slab gel electrophoresis, positive staining with ethidium bromide, co-migration with yeast tRNA on submerged gel electrophoresis in 1.5% Agarose M, and sensitivity to ribonuclease T2 and 0.3 M NaOH. Treatment with protease did not alter its allergenic activity. The RNA was capable of binding allergen-specific IgE in sera from two shrimp-sensitive patients, as demonstrated by microELISA and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) using antigen-coated nitrocellulose filter paper discs and purified 125I-labeled goat anti-human IgE. RNA isolated from shrimp by a conventional tRNA isolation procedure also had the ability to specifically bind IgE in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients. IgE antibodies to shrimp RNA did not recognize yeast tRNA or salmon testes DNA, and were not detected in sera of other subjects. The shrimp-derived RNA was further able to induce a reaginic response in mice. A combination of in vitro aminoacylation of shrimp tRNA and SPRIA resulted in the identification of the allergenic tRNA as tRNA(Tyr) and tRNA(Arg). Thus, shrimp tRNA is capable of inducing a specific IgE response in man.\r"

We present data showing that these naturally occurring human cytotoxic cells and murine NC cells have similar lytic mechanisms. Both the human cytotoxic cells described here, and murine NC cells, use tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to mediate the lysis of sensitive targets. Moreover, targets that resist murine NC-mediated lysis by a protein synthesis-dependent post-recognitive mechanism use a similar mechanism to prevent lysis mediated by naturally occurring human cytotoxic cells. In addition to the similarity of naturally occurring human cytotoxic cells and murine NC cells in their specificity and lytic mechanism, naturally occurring human cytotoxic cells and murine NC cells are also similar in that their activity is both associated with a monocyte lineage and age independent. Taken together, these data indicate that humans express NC activity.\r"

Glomerular deposits were induced by administering preformed immune complexes to young (2 to 4 mo) mice before they naturally acquired deposits from endogenous disease and to old (7 mo) mice with deposits from naturally acquired disease. The administration of excess antigen specifically removed deposits of preformed immune complexes in both groups. This was associated with a reduction in circulating large latticed complexes containing more than two antigen and two antibody molecules (greater than Ag2Ab2). Established deposits in old mice therefore did not interfere with removal of newly induced deposits of preformed immune complexes. Glomerular deposits were also induced in young mice by a chronic human serum albumin (HSA) immune complex model. The antigen in immune deposits induced by 2 wk of chronic antigen administration was solubilized and was removed within 48 hr of administering excess antigen. Circulating antibodies to the antigen were also reduced by excess antigen. Glomerular deposits of mouse immunoglobulin and complement were not significantly reduced by excess antigen but remained more intense than in mice of comparable age given preformed complexes. Thus deposits of other antigen antibody systems and possibly endogenous disease were induced by the chronic HSA immune complex model in NZB/W mice. However, defined antigen deposits within deposits containing multiple antigen antibody systems can clearly be removed by administering excess antigen.\r"

  ".W": "In previously published studies, highly cationized antibodies alone and in immune complexes bound to glomeruli by charge-charge interaction, but only immune complexes persisted in glomeruli. Because normal IgG does not deposit in glomeruli, studies were conducted to determine whether cationized antibodies can be prepared which deposit in glomeruli when bound to antigen but not when free in circulation. A series of cationized rabbit antiHSA was prepared with the number of added amino groups ranging from 13.3 to 60.2 per antibody molecule. Antibodies alone or in preformed soluble immune complexes, prepared at fivefold or 50-fold antigen excess, were administered to mice. With the injection of a fixed dose of 100 micrograms per mouse, antibodies alone did not deposit in glomeruli with less than 29.6 added amino groups by immunofluorescence microscopy. In contrast, 100 micrograms of antibodies with 23.5 added amino groups in immune complexes, made at fivefold antigen excess, formed immune deposits in glomeruli. With selected preparations of cationized, radiolabeled antibodies, deposition in glomeruli was quantified by isolation of mouse glomeruli. These quantitative data were in good agreement with the results of immunofluorescence microscopy. Immune complexes made at 50-fold antigen excess, containing only small-latticed immune complexes with no more than two antibody molecules per complex, deposited in glomeruli similar to antibodies alone. Selected cationized antibodies alone or in immune complexes were administered to mice in varying doses. In these experiments, glomerular deposition of immune complexes, made at fivefold antigen excess, was detected with five- to 10-fold smaller doses than the deposition of the same antibodies alone. These studies demonstrate that antibody molecules in immune complexes are more likely to deposit in glomeruli by charge-charge interactions than antibodies alone.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of leukocytes with endothelial cells is intrinsic to the process of leukocyte extravasation, whether during the entry of blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes into sites of acute and chronic inflammation, or during the homing of lymphocytes to lymphoid organs. A lymphocyte surface glycoprotein, defined by monoclonal antibody MEL-14, has been described that appears to mediate lymphocyte recognition of postcapillary venules in peripheral lymph nodes, and to control the migration of lymphocytes from the blood into these lymphoid organs. We now report that the antigenic determinant recognized by MEL-14 is present at high levels on other leukocytes as well, including neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils; and we demonstrate involvement of the MEL-14 antigen in neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions. MEL-14 immunoprecipitates a neutrophil surface protein of Mr approximately 100,000, similar in m.w. to the 80,000 to 90,000 dalton lymphocyte surface MEL-14 antigen, and it blocks the interaction of neutrophils with endothelial cells in an in vitro model of adhesion to postcapillary venules in lymph node frozen sections. Neutrophil binding to lymph node venules is also inhibited by PPME, a mannose-6-phosphate-rich yeast polysaccharide that is thought to mimic the endothelial cell ligand for the MEL-14-defined lymphocyte receptor. Interestingly, neither MEL-14 nor PPME exhibit a major effect on neutrophil binding to postcapillary venules in Peyer's patches, suggesting that as for lymphocytes, the neutrophil MEL-14 antigen is involved in recognition of tissue-specific endothelial determinants. Finally, we show that MEL-14 inhibits the capacity of neutrophils to migrate from the blood into sites of acute inflammation in the skin. These observations lead us to propose that receptors for tissue-specific endothelial determinants are utilized by neutrophils and lymphocytes and probably other leukocytes during the physiologic process of leukocyte extravasation in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations have demonstrated that the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) is stimulated by hyaluronic acid (HA). The aim of the present investigation was to study the molecular basis for the effect of HA. HA fragments of m.w. in the range from 792 (tetrasaccharide) to 3,000,000 all stimulated the chemotactic and phagocytic function of PMN. The active concentration ranged from 4 to 64 pmol/liter, irrespective of the molecular size. Further investigations demonstrated that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAGA) was the smallest active fragment of HA. NAGA is one of the components from which HA is built up; the other component glucuronic acid was without effect, and so were the other glycosaminoglycans, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and D-glucosamine. Finally, Con A, the glucopyranosyl and glucomannosyl binding lectin, inhibited the stimulatory effect of NAGA. As is the case with HA, fibronectin also acts as a necessary cofactor to NAGA when incubations are made in the absence of whole blood or serum. The present results strongly indicated that the combined action of NAGA and fibronectin worked directly on the PMN by an interaction at the cellular membrane level. We conclude that the stimulatory action of HA on granulocyte functions is mediated through one of its two structural components, i.e., NAGA.\r"

We have examined the regulatory signals determining human Thy-1 expression through serologic analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids retaining human chromosome 11 in which the fusion partners belong to distinct differentiation lineages. Cell surface expression of human Thy-1 was determined by mixed hemadsorption assays with two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), K117 and L127, shown to detect authentic human Thy-1 through analysis of COS-7 monkey kidney cells transfected with a cloned human Thy-1 gene. Three different patterns of human Thy-1 expression were observed when hybrid cells, constructed with different human and rodent cell types, were tested with mAb K117 and L127. Hybrids formed between Thy-1+ human neuroblastoma cells and Thy-1- mouse neuroblastoma cells, or hybrids between Thy-1+ human fibroblasts and the Thy-1- mouse kidney carcinoma, RAG, retain human Thy-1 expression. In contrast, hybrids formed between either Thy-1+ human neuroblastoma cells or Thy-1+ human fibroblasts and Thy-1- mouse L cells lose expression of human Thy-1 even though chromosome 11 is retained. Finally, hybrids formed between Thy-1- human peripheral lymphocytes or a Thy-1- lymphoblastoid B cell line and Thy-1- Chinese hamster fibroblasts begin to express human Thy-1. These studies suggest that both positive and negative trans-acting signals may play a role in the tissue-specific regulation of the human Thy-1 gene.\r"

MTP-PE was dissolved in a phosphate-buffered saline to produce micelles. Single or multiple oral administrations of MTP-PE produced tumoricidal activation in both lung and peritoneal macrophages. This was in direct contrast to the i.v. or i.p. administrations of MTP-PE incorporated in liposomes, which produced activation in only lung or only peritoneal macrophages, respectively. The distribution and fate of [3H]-labeled MTP-PE subsequent to oral administration revealed that MTP-PE was found in various organs independent of reticuloendothelial activity. Finally, the repeated twice-weekly oral administrations of MTP-PE inhibited lung and lymph node metastasis in C57BL/6 mice by syngeneic B16 melanoma cells. The oral administration of MTP-PE, however, was not effective in eradicating well-established melanoma metastases. We conclude that the oral administration of a lipophilic muramyl dipeptide produces systemic activation of macrophages. The feasibility of enhancing host defense against infections and cancer by the oral administration of an immunomodulator has obvious clinical advantages.\r"

The cell line SG3/5 was generated by transfection of a nonproducing mouse myeloma line (SP2/0) with a chimeric gene construct composed of variable regions from the mouse 17-1A immunoglobulin (gamma 2a, kappa) and constant regions of human k and gamma 3 immunoglobulin genes. The secreted immunoglobulin was bound by mouse monoclonal antibodies to human IgG(Fc) and IgG3 but not by staphylococcal protein A. Gel filtration HPLC profiles of purified chimeric antibody were similar to normal human IgG3 but quite different from native 17-1A and normal human IgG1, 2, and 4. Native and chimeric 17-1A had similar patterns of reactivity with colon cancer, other adenocarcinoma, and leukemic cell lines. Competitive inhibition documented that native and chimeric 17-1A had identical capacities to inhibit radiolabeled native 17-1A binding to colon cancer cell lines. Thus, the chimeric 17-1A exhibits molecular characteristics of normal human IgG3 but retains the specificity and binding affinity of the native 17-1A murine monoclonal antibody. The native and chimeric 17-1A mediated similar modest degrees of human lymphocyte and monocyte ADCC in a 4-hr 51Cr release assay, and both failed to mediate complement lysis of colon carcinoma cell lines in the presence of human complement. This human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody may be a good candidate for use in clinical trials because it retains the tumor antigen specificity and human effector cell recognition of the native 17-1A, would presumably have a fivefold to 10-fold longer circulating half-life in man, and should be considerably less immunogenic as compared with native murine immunoglobulins.\r"

Mice depleted of NK cells in this manner had no lasting alteration in the distribution of other lymphocyte subsets in the spleen and did not demonstrate reduced cellular or humoral immunity. Depletion of NK cells, however, markedly increased the localization and growth of B16 melanoma cells or CT 38 colon carcinoma cells in the lung after i.v. administration of tumor cells. Moreover, mice given B16 tumors and treated with anti-NK-1.1 had reduced survival. NK cells were important in host resistance to sublines of B16 that had been passaged either in vivo or in vitro, which express, respectively, high and low levels of class I major histocompatibility antigens. These findings support a role for NK cells in host defense against malignancy. The ability to selectively remove NK cells in vivo by MAb will permit a better understanding of their physiologic role.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells passively sensitized with monoclonal IgE released paf-acether (platelet-activating factor) and beta-hexosaminidase when challenged with the specific antigen. The formation and the release of paf-acether followed an early increase in the activity of the acetyltransferase, the main enzyme in paf-acether biosynthesis. The antigen-induced activation of the acetyltransferase was dependent on physiologic temperature and on the presence of Ca2+. By using microsomal fractions from unchallenged and challenged mast cells, the Vmax values were 3.5 and 12.0 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, whereas in both cases a Km value for acetyl-coenzyme A of 172 microM was measured. The stimulation of acetyltransferase could be mimicked in vitro under experimental conditions which favor phosphorylation, i.e. adding ATP and Mg2+ to lysates from unchallenged mast cells. In contrast, ATP and Mg2+ were uneffective on lysates from challenged cells that exhibited high level of acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of the enzyme already took place at the time of cell stimulation. Moreover, addition of alkaline phosphatase to microsomal fraction obtained from either antigen-challenged mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells or unchallenged cells, resulted in 52% and 43% loss of acetyltransferase activity, respectively. Phorbol myristate acetate treatment of cells doubled the enzyme activity supporting the phosphorylation hypothesis. Thus, we report on the immunologic activation of a key enzyme for paf-acether synthesis and on the mechanism of this activation in a pure mast cell population. A link between bridging of IgE receptors and the activation of an enzyme critical to the formation of a lipid mediator is thereby evidenced.\r"

Jel 241 is an autoimmune monoclonal antibody derived from an NZB/NZW mouse which binds to double-stranded DNA. Thermal denaturation profiles of poly[d(AT)] were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of IgG Jel 241. From these data it was estimated that the IgG occludes 12 base-pairs on duplex DNA, and the binding to double-stranded DNA was at least four orders of magnitude greater than to single-stranded DNA. In addition, intrinsic association constants (K(O)) were measured by a gel filtration technique for the interaction of both Fab and IgG Jel 241 to native calf thymus DNA. K(O) for the IgG was only 60-fold greater than for the Fab fragment for which K(O) was 4.4 X 10(4) M-1 at an NaCl concentration of 150 mM. Also, K(O) for the Fab increased dramatically with decreasing ionic strength, suggesting that there are four phosphates involved in the interaction. These techniques should be applicable to most autoimmune antibodies which bind to nucleic acid polymers.\r"

Differences in the complement-mediated binding of these IC to rabbit blood cells (platelets) were also studied. Complexation of either double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded (ss) DNA with IgG anti-DNA tends to preclude in vivo DNA recognition mechanisms; the DNA is cleared as part of an IC at a rate slower than that of free DNA. Binding of ds- or ssDNA by IgM anti-DNA antibodies leads to formation of IC which are cleared more like free DNA, and this effect is most evident for ssDNA. However, although both IgG- and IgM-containing IC bound rapidly to blood cells in vivo, significant differences in their immunochemistry were apparent. For example, the DNA in IgM-containing IC was more susceptible to both in vivo and in vitro degradation. In addition, the binding of IgM-containing IC to rabbit platelets and human red blood cells was considerably more labile. Based on this systematic investigation of the soluble antibody/DNA IC that can potentially form in the circulation of a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, it should be possible to formulate predictions regarding the relative pathogenic potential of these IC.\r"

We now report on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the DQ alpha and DQ beta cDNA from the same DR5 cell line, which also types as DQw3. Comparison with other available DQ sequences indicates that DQ alpha has one region of major variability, whereas DQ beta appears to have four regions of variability. In addition, these comparisons indicate that DQw3 alpha from DR5 is different from DQw3 alpha from DR4, but identical to DQw2 alpha from DR3. In contrast, DQw3 beta from DR5 is very similar to DQw3 beta from DR4. These data indicate that at least for DQw2 and DQw3 it is the DQ beta chain that is responsible for DQ typing. Most sequence differences in DQ alleles can be attributed to point mutations; however, codon additions/deletions in the DQ alpha chain may contribute to variability. In addition, regions of possible gene conversion in the DQ alpha and DQ beta chains is suggested by the presence of a chi-like sequence in each chain. Finally, comparison of available haplotypes suggest recombination events may take place between DQ beta and DQ alpha, between DQ alpha and DR beta I, and between DR beta I and DR beta III.\r"

Calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to lymphocyte membrane was found to reach equilibrium within 5 min of incubation at 37 degrees C and to be saturable and specific. A single class of high affinity-binding sites was identified, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 to 3 X 10(-8) M and a total binding capacity (Bt) of 1 to 2 pmol/mg membrane protein. The free calcium concentration necessary for half-maximal binding was 100 to 300 nM. This was strikingly similar to the cytoplasmic-free calcium activity [Ca2+]i measured by the Quin-2 fluorescence technique, particularly after stimulation with phytomitogens. Calmodulin binding was inhibitable by trifluoperazine (TFP), W-7, and chloropramazine, all of which are calmodulin antagonists. The concentration of TFP that caused 50% inhibition of lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytomitogens was found to be identical to the concentration of TFP which causes 50% inhibition of calmodulin binding to lymphocyte plasma membrane. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by gel overlay and autoradiography with iodinated calmodulin revealed five calcium-dependent, TFP-inhibitable, calmodulin-binding polypeptides.\r"

  ".U": "87224177\r", 
  ".W": "Our studies and other investigations have shown that NK effector cells can also mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through the use of the Fc gamma receptor on the NK cell membrane. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) derived from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex exhibit a poor NK activity due to a defective \"trigger\" required for activation in the lethal hit stage of the NK lytic pathway. Consequently, it was important to delineate whether the defect in AIDS NK cells affected the ADCC function. By using the 51Cr-release assay, the ADCC cytotoxic activity of AIDS PBL was found to be within the normal range, despite the absence of significant NK activity. Several experiments corroborated that the same effector cells mediate both NK CMC and ADCC. Depletion of Fc gamma R-bearing cells resulted in elimination of both the ADCC and NK cytotoxic functions. Single cell analyses, using one- and two-target cell conjugates, revealed that the frequency of ADCC effector:target conjugates and the frequency of killer cells from AIDS PBL were comparable to the frequencies seen in the normal controls. However, when mixtures of NK and ADCC targets were used to form mixed two-target conjugates, the AIDS effector cells lysed only the bound ADCC target, whereas the normal effector cells lysed both the bound NK and ADCC targets. These results demonstrate clearly that the same NK/K effector cells from AIDS PBL, defective in NK activity, are not impaired in mediating ADCC activity. These findings were supported by the demonstration that AIDS PBL stimulated with ADCC targets, but not with NK targets, released NK cytotoxic factors, postulated mediators of the NK CMC reaction. These findings indicate that the NK/K cells in AIDS are triggered normally for ADCC activity but are not triggered for NK activity. Furthermore, the results indicate that the lytic machinery is not impaired in the AIDS NK/K cells.\r"

In this report, animals injected once or chronically for 9 to 12 wk had reduced content of muscle AChR. The chronically injected animals also had diminished miniature endplate potential amplitudes, but to a lesser extent than the reduction in AChR content.

We have confirmed that this fetal resorption rate can be significantly reduced by immunizing the female with C57BL rather than DBA leukocytes. The current studies have been extended to show the effect of continued immunization into second pregnancies. Three new findings emerge: second pregnancies in unimmunized CBA/J females X DBA/2 males proceed with a low percentage of spontaneous resorptions; continued immunization of multigravid, multiparous mice is associated with a high percentage of late onset fetal resorptions; and comparison of sex ratios between treated and untreated pregnancies showed no significant shift. These results suggest that untreated CBA/J females mated to DBA/2 males can be immunized to trophoblast antigens during first pregnancies, and that such immunization leads to \"normal\" reproductive outcome in subsequent untreated pregnancies. Persistent immunization with leukocytes appears to increase the percentage of fetal wastage in subsequent pregnancies regardless of whether the mother receives paternal or nonpaternal leukocytes. Intentional chronic immunization with male leukocytes does not influence the sex ratio of viable offspring. These data are discussed with reference to immunotherapy for women who suffer unexplained, recurrent spontaneous abortions.\r"

  ".W": "Using an improved skin chamber technique, the consequences of prolonged contact of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet-activating factor (paf-acether) with human dermis were evaluated quantitatively and kinetically in vivo. Leukocyte chemotaxis, histoenzymologic alterations, and modifications in vascular permeability were studied in two sets of experiments. In a first set of experiments, the dose-effect relationship of LTB4 and paf-acether on leukocyte migration was studied. LTB4 (3 X 10(-8) M to 9 X 10(-7) M) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) elicited an intense dose-dependent and time-dependent neutrophil migration. Paf-acether, at the same concentration range, induced a significant increase in cell migration only at 9 X 10(-7) M and when diluted in HBSS containing 0.25% serum albumin (HBSS-BSA). Histoenzymologic analysis demonstrated that LTB4 in vivo induced degranulation of most of the neutrophils migrating through the dermis. Paf-acether caused mild degranulation of neutrophils and induced the appearance of degranulated basophils in dermal vessels. A second set of experiments was designed to study simultaneously the modifications in vascular permeability and cell migration induced by LTB4 and paf-acether, with or without prostaglandin E2 (both at a concentration of 3 X 10(-7) M in HBSS). Since spontaneous protein diffusion in HBSS progressively declined up to a plateau reached after 20 h (1.2 +/- 0.15 mg of proteins/cm2/2 h), these experiments were carried out after a 20-h equilibration period. Leukotriene B4 induced a late and slight increase in vascular permeability. Paf-acether did so intensely and transiently. Prostaglandin E2 significantly enhanced protein diffusion and neutrophil migration induced by LTB4 and, to a lesser extent, by paf-acether. Interestingly, despite the reintroduction into the skin chambers of freshly prepared solutions containing the mediators, leukocyte migration and protein diffusion progressively decreased during the experiments. This suggests the local production of anti-inflammatory factors that inhibit local mediators and thus regulate the inflammatory response.\r"

Previous studies demonstrated that antidromic stimulation results in substance P (SP) release from nerve endings, SP stimulates histamine release (HR) from rat mast cells in vitro, and intradermal SP in humans produces wheals identical to those induced by histamine. These studies suggest a possible role for SP as a link between neurologic events and cutaneous mast cell-mediated reactions. We therefore investigated SP-induced HR in an in vitro preparation of human skin mast cells. Human foreskin sections were incubated with varying concentrations of SP. Histamine was assayed using automated fluorimetry and release was calculated as a percentage of total tissue histamine. Substance P caused dose-dependent HR over a range from 10(-5) M (1.3%) to 5 X 10(-4) M (25.1%). Histamine release was optimal at 3 mM calcium and was blocked by pretreatment with calcium chelation. Naloxone failed to block HR. These studies suggest that HR from skin mast cells by SP may play a role in neural modulation of poorly understood inflammatory skin conditions.\r"

The increase in ear swelling was triphasic with peak increases at 1.5 h (14.3 +/- 1.6 X 10(-2) mm; mean +/- SEM), 8 h (19.9 +/- 1.8 X 10(-2) mm), and 24 h (30.2 +/- 2.9 X 10(-2) mm). A triphasic pattern of increased serum histamine was noted at 1-4 h (117% over control levels), at 12 h (131%), and at 48 h (133%). Examination of the tissue specimens from challenged animals showed modest (1+) degranulation of mast cells between 1 and 6 h with extensive (2+) degranulation at 12 h. In addition, hypogranulated mast cells were evident between 1 and 6 h, at 24 h, and at 48 h. There were no statistically significant differences in mast cell numbers at any time. Neither platelets nor other formed elements of the blood contributed to the increased blood histamine levels. These data show that mast cells are activated in a triphasic pattern during ACH, and thus suggest both early and late roles for the mast cell and its products in the evolution of ACH.\r"

Histamine was present in extracts made from whole moths and from urticating hairs. Extracts made from other moth parts contained no histamine. Cutaneous wheals occurred after intradermal injections of histamine and various concentrations of Hylesia extract (HE) into the backs of cynomolgus monkeys. This whealing response was suppressed by pretreatment of the animals with diphenhydramine hydrochloride, but not by pretreatment with indomethacin. Histologic examinations showed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate around dilated capillaries without evidence of mast cell degranulation in HE-injected sites but not in controls. These findings provide evidence that histamine may be the mediator responsible for the urticarial lesions seen after contact with Hylesia moths.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to determine whether ultraviolet (UV) radiation exerts its effect through the generation of oxygen intermediates on Langerhans cells (LC). Guinea pigs were exposed to one single dose of UVB (0.9-2.7J/cm2), and biopsy specimens were taken 5 days after the irradiation. The population of LC was evaluated using ATPase-stained epidermal sheets. These exposures reduced the number of LC to 20-25% of the original density. On the other hand, superoxide dismutase (SOD) (0.02-0.2 mg), a scavenger of superoxide anion, which had been injected intradermally just before UV radiation, significantly prevented the depletion of LC, although not completely (37-40% of the original density). The injection immediately after the exposure was still significantly effective, but less so. Other scavengers of oxygen intermediates including catalase, D-mannitol, and L-histidine revealed no detectable effect. A single exposure of UVB at doses of 0.3-0.6 J/cm2 did not deplete the ATPase-positive LC. However, the same dose of UVB reduced the number of LC to 70%, when exposed after the injection of an SOD inactivator, diethyldithiocarbamate, possibly due to inactivation of physiologically existing SOD. These observations indicate that oxygen intermediates such as superoxide anion or its subsequent species are generated by UV radiation exposure and damage the epidermal LC.\r"

  ".W": "The stratum corneum of mammalian epidermis contains a mixture of ceramides, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl sulfate, amounting to 14% of the dry weight of the tissue, that can be removed by exhaustive extraction with chloroform/methanol. Subsequent mild alkaline hydrolysis liberates additional lipid, consisting almost exclusively of C30-C34 omega-hydroxyacids in amide linkage with sphingosine, equal to 2% of the tissue mass. In the present study, transmission electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that the initial extraction removes the intercellular lamellae that constitute the epidermal water barrier but leaves the lucent band that has been termed the corneocyte plasma membrane. The subsequent alkaline hydrolysis and lipid extraction remove the lucent band, which must therefore contain the omega-hydroxyacylsphingosines. From the results of in situ derivatization of these lipids and the construction of molecular models, it is inferred that the bound lipids exist in ester linkage with protein on the surface of the corneocyte envelope. The tightly packed hydroxyacylsphingosine molecules thus form a lipid envelope for each corneocyte.\r"

Membrane coating granules (MCGs), small intracellular organelles found in the uppermost layers of the living epidermis, contain stacks of membranous disks which are extruded into the intercellular space and undergo both biochemical and physical changes to form the lipid sheets which constitute this barrier. Using ruthenium tetroxide as a secondary fixative, we are able to demonstrate stacks of lamellae filling the intercellular spaces in the uppermost layers of the stratum corneum. The structure of these lipid lamellae is consistent with the proposed derivation of MCG lipid disks and also suggests that the lipid bilayer adjacent to the corneocyte cell envelope may be assembled from lipids not derived from MCGs.\r"

Surface glycoconjugates of the differentiated cells from the spinous and lower granular layers bind Ulex europeus agglutinin I (UEA) (alpha-L-fucosyl specificity). The change from GS I-B4 binding to UEA binding was studied in rat keratinocytes that were cultured as a monolayer in low-calcium medium until confluence, and then induced to stratify and terminally differentiate by raising the calcium concentration of the medium. The cells in the monolayer had basal cell morphology and exhibited surface binding of GS I-B4. However, at confluence, 30-40% of these cells also showed surface binding of UEA. There was an increase with time in the number of cells which bound both GS I-B4 and UEA. Raising the calcium concentration of the medium resulted in an increase in UEA binding. Cells of the upper layers of the stratifying cultures showed intense UEA binding but did not show any GS I-B4 binding. Double staining of frozen sections of newborn rat skin with fluorescein-conjugated GS I-B4 and rhodamine-conjugated UEA revealed that the surfaces of cells from the lower spinous layer bound both lectins. Thirty percent of the major glycoprotein fraction, that was isolated from the membranes of the epidermal cells of the newborn rat and was bound to an affinity column of UEA-Sepharose 4B, was also bound to an affinity column of GS I-B4-Sepharose 4B. These results indicate that surface glycoconjugates of rat keratinocytes differentiating in culture exhibit a change from GS I-B4 binding to UEA binding; the change in the cell surface glycoconjugates that results in the appearance of UEA binding, a feature of differentiated cells, occurs independently of stratification; and the change from GS I-B4 binding to UEA binding probably involves an \"intermediate\" glycoconjugate that binds both GS I-B4 and UEA and is found on the surface of cells from the lower spinous layer of the epidermis of the newborn rat.\r"

  ".W": "Dermal fibrosis, characterized by collagen accumulation, is the hallmark of several cutaneous diseases. To examine the mechanisms of collagen deposition in fibrotic skin diseases, fibroblast cultures were established from the skin of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis, morphea, scleredema, familial cutaneous collagenoma, connective tissue nevi of the collagen type, or keloids; these patients served as prototypes of fibrotic skin diseases with varying clinical features and potentially different etiologic factors. Collagen production was assayed by the synthesis of [3H]hydroxyproline, and types I and III procollagen messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined by dot blot hybridizations using human type I and type III procollagen-specific cDNA probes. The collagen production in fibroblast cultures from the fibrotic diseases was increased up to 6-fold over the controls, and a relatively good correlation between the collagen production and type I collagen mRNA levels was noted. The type I/III procollagen mRNA ratio in control fibroblast cultures was 5.9 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- SD). The corresponding ratio in keloid cell culture was markedly increased, while slightly decreased values were noted in the case of morphea and familial cutaneous collagenoma; the values in other cultures were within the normal range. The results suggest that procollagen production in fibroblast cultures derived from fibrotic skin diseases reflects elevated levels of the corresponding procollagen mRNA. The increased mRNA abundance, suggesting pretranslational control, may result from enhanced transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene or alternatively reflects increased stability of the mRNA molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Elastin synthesis is initiated in many organs during the latter part of fetal development. By birth, accumulation of elastin in elastic fibers accounts in large part for the integrity and resilience of skin, blood vessels, and lungs. Developmental studies in several connective tissues of nonhuman vertebrates indicate that elastin synthesis is rapidly initiated during fetal life and that its expression is largely controlled by the abundance of its mRNA. Previous evidence for elastin synthesis in the developing human fetus has been derived from either histologic inference or studies of net accumulation. We now report that the developmental induction of cutaneous elastin synthesis appears to be stably reflected in cell culture. Production of elastin by human skin fibroblasts increased 7- to 14-fold between 17 and 19 weeks of gestation, reaching the levels found in neonatal skin fibroblasts. Consistent with other developmental studies, elastin synthesis was found to be under pretranslational control with relative mRNA levels increasing 6- to 15-fold by 19 weeks of gestation. Under the same circumstances, collagen expression and total protein synthesis were relatively constant among all strains examined. Human skin fibroblasts may thus be a useful system for examining developmentally regulated elastin gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "87224308\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown recently that brief pulses of 577 nm radiation from the tunable dye laser are absorbed selectively by oxyhemoglobin. This absorption is associated with highly specific damage to superficial vascular plexus blood vessels in those with lightly pigmented (type I-II) skin. To determine whether pigmentary differences in the overlying epidermis influence this target specificity, we exposed both type I (fair) and type V (dark) normal human skin to varying radiant exposure doses over 1.5-microsecond pulse durations from the tunable dye laser at a wavelength of 577 nm. Using ultrastructural techniques, we found in type I skin that even clinical subthreshold laser exposures caused reproducible alterations of erythrocytes and adjacent dermal vascular endothelium without comparable damage to the overlying epidermis. In contrast, degenerated epidermal basal cells represented the predominant form of cellular damage after laser exposure of type V skin at comparable doses. We conclude that epidermal melanin and vascular hemoglobin are competing sites for 577 nm laser absorption and damage, and that the target specificity of the 577 nm tunable dye laser is therefore influenced by variations in epidermal pigmentation. This finding is relevant to the clinical application of the tunable dye laser in the ablative treatment of vascular lesions. We also found on ultrastructure that the presence of electron-lucent circular structures of approximately 800 A in diameter were observed only at and above clinical threshold doses in those with type I skin and at the highest dose of 2.75 J/cm2 in type V skin. It has been proposed that these structures might be heat-fixed molds of water vapor. Both this and ultrastructural changes of epidermal basal cells demonstrate mechanisms responsible for alteration of tissue after exposure to 577 nm, which are discussed.\r"

Termination of cyclosporine administration resulted in enhanced integumental and choroidal amelanosis, choroidal inflammation, and chorioretinal damage beyond that observed in nontreated controls. These results suggest that withdrawal of cyclosporine in treatment of this spontaneous autoimmune disease may exacerbate associated symptoms.\r"

The ideal surgical treatment would be precise and total removal of abnormal tissue with maximal sparing of remaining structures. The ultraviolet (UV) excimer laser is capable of such precise tissue removal due to the penetration depth of 193 nm and 248 nm irradiation of 1 micron per pulse. This type of ablative tissue removal requires a high repetition rate for efficient lesional destruction. Excimer laser radiation at 193 nm is capable of high repetition rates, which are necessary while 248 nm radiation causes increasing nonspecific thermal injury as the laser repetition rate is increased.\r"

In 24 women follicle development was stimulated by clomiphene and gonadotropin treatment, and oocytes were collected by laparoscopy under epidural analgesia in 11 women and under fentanyl-supplemented nitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia in 13. The plasma levels of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (ir beta-E), cortisol, and prolactin (PRL) did not change under epidural analgesia per se, but after the start of laparoscopy, increased release of all these stress hormones was observed. General anesthesia per se increased the release of PRL, whereas the release of cortisol and ir beta-E decreased, probably due to the effects of fentanyl and thiopentone. During the stress attributed to laparoscopy, significantly more ir beta-E and cortisol was released under epidural than under general anesthesia, whereas the release of PRL was more significant under general anesthesia. These results show that neither mode of anesthesia prevented the stress response to laparoscopy. In the subsequent midluteal phase, the mean plasma level of progesterone and the mean progesterone-estradiol ratio were significantly greater in the epidural than in the general anesthesia group, suggesting that the mode of anesthesia may have an effect on the luteal phase. The significance of this difference on the conception rate remained unsolved, however.\r"

In an attempt to create a model suitable for investigation of the mechanisms of HP, we transferred cells and serum from sensitized (Micropolyspora faeni in Freund's adjuvant) strain 2 guinea pigs to naive animals. Cells (peritoneal exudate, lymph node, or spleen) were cultured for 72 hours with either concanavalin A (Con A, 1 microgram/ml) or a soluble extract of M. faeni (10 micrograms/ml). We then injected the cells intravenously (IV) into naive guinea pigs, skin tested with purified protein derivative (PPD), challenged the animals intratracheally (IT) with M. faeni 48 hours after the cell transfer, and killed them 4 days (IT) with M. faeni 48 hours after the cell transfer, and killed them 4 days after IT challenge. We also transferred noncultured cells and antibody-containing serum from sensitized animals. Randomly selected microscopic fields of the lung (150 per animal) were judged to be normal or abnormal. All guinea pigs were maintained in high-efficiency particulate accumulator-filtered air. Compared with control animals that received media IV, there was a substantial increase (P less than 0.01) in the extent of pulmonary abnormalities in the animals receiving lymph node cells or spleen cells cultured with M. faeni, and peritoneal exudate cells cultured with Con A. Findings in recipients of peritoneal exudate cells cultured with M. faeni, or lymph node cells or spleen cells cultured with Con A did not differ from those in the control group. In contrast to cultured cells, noncultured cells and antibody-containing serum did not transfer susceptibility. PPD skin reactivity was present only in recipients of noncultured cells and not in recipients of serum or cultured cells. We conclude that experimental HP can be transferred with cultured cells from sensitized animals and that HP appears to be a cell-mediated process.\r"

This was shown to be caused by direct inhibition of factor Xa clotting activity by HTGL, although the amidolytic activity of factor Xa was unaffected. Preincubation of factor Xa with CaCl2 and phospholipid reduced the rate of inhibition of HTGL, indicating that phospholipid-binding sites may be involved. Heparin, and low-affinity heparin, reduced the anti-Xa activity of HTGL, suggesting that heparin and factor Xa compete for the same binding sites on the lipase molecule. These results suggest that at least part of the enhanced anti-Xa clotting activity observed after injection of heparin and heparin analogues is caused by the release of HTGL. This release could contribute toward the anticoagulant and antithrombotic actions of these drugs.\r"

Five animals served as sham-operated controls.

In septic animals, systemic oxygen extraction increased from 33% +/- 5% to 70% +/- 5% (P less than 0.01) to maintain total body oxygen consumption. However, arterial lactate level increased from 0.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/L to 4.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (P less than 0.01) over the same study interval. Cardiac output was correlated with central venous oxygen desaturation (r = 0.66, P less than 0.001). Central venous oxygen saturation was inversely correlated with lactate concentration (r = -0.87, P less than 0.001). These data suggest that cellular oxygen utilization is largely maintained during rapidly fatal septic shock.\r"

Cirrhotic rats with body temperature maintained at 38 degrees C were found to have increased trapping of microspheres in the pulmonary bed when compared with control rats studied under similar conditions (8.2% +/- 2.2% vs. 3.6% +/- 0.8%, P less than 0.05). The extent of arteriovenous shunting was also measured in control rats maintained at various body temperatures (34 degrees to 40 degrees C) with and without prior alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mg/kg). Both body warming and alpha-adrenergic blockade independently increased the extent of arteriovenous shunting. In cirrhotic rats, body warming also increased shunting. However, in contrast to findings in control rats, alpha-adrenergic blockade did not further increase shunting in cirrhotic rats warmed to 40 degrees C. Moreover, the degree of shunting after combined body warming and alpha-adrenergic blockade was similar in cirrhotic and control rats. Our results indicate that increased peripheral arteriovenous shunting occurs in this model of experimental cirrhosis, and that the increased shunting may be related to altered physiologic regulation of arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow.\r"

We studied the effect of SAM on monocyte-macrophage cytotoxicity against a tumor cell line. Alveolar macrophages were studied from 15 subjects without cancer. Tumor growth, as assessed by tritiated thymidine incorporation, was significantly inhibited by the macrophages alone (tumor alone median 39,401 cpm, macrophages plus tumor median 12,153 cpm, P less than 0.01). Tumor cytotoxicity was enhanced by preincubating the macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (median 37 cpm, P less than 0.01) or coincubating the tumor cells and macrophages with SAM (median 5474 cpm, P less than 0.01). Similar results were seen when using blood adherent mononuclear cells. There was increasing cytotoxicity for the adherent mononuclear cells with increasing amounts of SAM. When the various phospholipids of SAM were studied, it was found that phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidyl glycerol all enhanced adherent mononuclear cell cytotoxicity, whereas phosphatidylinositol inhibited adherent mononuclear cell cytotoxicity. These studies suggest that SAM may have important immunoregulatory function for the alveolar macrophage.\r"

To determine whether the lesion is primarily in the stem cells or whether there is also a microenvironmental component we have used the Dexter-type long-term marrow cultures. Normal marrow maintains hemopoiesis for several weeks to months in such cultures, whereas \"busulfan-marrow\" will not support long-term growth. When normal marrow cells were transplanted onto an established adherent layer, whether derived from normal or busulfan marrow, normal hemopoiesis was established. However, busulfan-treated marrow cells would not establish hemopoiesis even when transplanted onto a normal stem cell-depleted adherent layer. It appears, therefore, that the primary lesion induced by busulfan is in the stem cells rather than in the microenvironment.\r"

Augmented TXB2 platelet synthesis and attenuated vascular prostacyclin formation have been demonstrated in diabetes mellitus. We undertook to establish a simple method of extracting urinary TXB2 (UTXB2) and to elucidate the pathophysiologic role of renal TXA2 in diabetes mellitus. One-step extraction of UTXB2 with an octadecylsilyl-silica column was sufficient as pretreatment for TXB2 radioimmunoassay because recovery of UTXB2 was good, the eluate was parallel with the dose-response curve, and the value coincided with that obtained by the conventional method. When platelet TXA2 synthesis was completely suppressed by administration of 100 mg aspirin, urinary TXB2 excretion (UTXB2V) declined to 41% of the initial levels, suggesting that renal TXA2 formation contributes significantly to UTXB2V. UTXB2V was 94.5 +/- 14.0 ng/day or 108.8 +/- 17.3 ng/gm creatinine in controls. Approximately half of the patients with diabetes demonstrated a UTXB2 level higher than the mean + 2 SD level of controls. Although UTXB2V did not show a significant correlation with protein excretion, UTXB2V in patients with diabetes with proteinuria greater than 100 mg/day was augmented (224.4 +/- 30.5 ng/day) compared with that in patients with diabetes without proteinuria greater than 100 mg/day. Furthermore, UTXB2V correlated negatively with the p-aminohippuric acid clearance rate, but not with the creatinine clearance rate. The results suggest that renal TXA2 synthesis may be augmented in diabetic nephropathy and may play a pathophysiologic role in renal hemodynamics as well as in protein excretion.\r"

HVL rats showed no differences in systemic hemodynamics compared with control rats, with the exception of decreased renal blood flow and increased renal vascular resistance. HVL rats showed increased portal and intrahepatic pressure, without other differences in splanchnic hemodynamics or in portal-systemic shunts. Clearance studies revealed that under basal conditions, HVL rats showed lower glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, urinary flow, and sodium, chloride, and potassium excretion than control rats. After saline infusion (3% body weight, 15 ml/hr) differences in glomerular filtration rate became nonsignificant, but urinary flow and electrolyte excretion remained lower in HVL than in control rats. Under basal conditions, plasma norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations were higher and urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2 alpha levels were lower in HVL than in control animals. These results demonstrate that chronic and progressive hepatic congestion results in impaired renal function with decreased water and electrolyte excretion, and suggest the involvement of a hepatorenal sympathetic reflex in these alterations. Renal effects could also be mediated by the low levels of PGE.\r"

  ".W": "Although severe potassium depletion has been shown to cause sodium retention, the effect of small potassium losses on sodium excretion is unknown. Seven healthy male volunteers were given a diet containing 35 mEq sodium and either low (10 mEq) or normal (90 mEq) potassium intake for 9 days. With the low potassium diet plasma potassium concentration decreased by 0.60 +/- 0.15 mEq/L. The cumulative potassium balance with this diet was negative (-124 +/- 22 mEq). Cumulative sodium balance was -82 +/- 43 mEq with the normal potassium diet but was positive (20 +/- 22 mEq) when the same subjects ingested a low potassium diet (P less than 0.05). A significant difference in sodium excretion could be detected as early as day 1 of potassium restriction. To study the effect of potassium depletion on the renal ability to handle a short-term sodium load, on day 10 each subject received a 2 L isotonic saline infusion over a period of 4 hours. Subjects while ingesting a normal potassium diet excreted 20% +/- 4% of the administered load. The same subjects while ingesting a low potassium diet excreted only 9% +/- 3% of the administered load (P less than 0.001). The difference in sodium excretion was not dependent on changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, or plasma and urinary catecholamines. We conclude that variations in dietary potassium strikingly modify sodium excretion. Even mild potassium depletion impairs the renal ability to handle a short-term sodium load.\r"

The specificity of the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvres linked to the typical ppv is also confirmed by the data obtained by testing for VHT (VHT-test-battery). Ppv can have a repercussion upon the vestibulospinal reflex. That the same ppv disturbance can coincide with normal as well as with abnormal posturographic data, pleads for the intervention of central adaptive mechanisms. The effect of VHT is due to stimulation of these central adaptive mechanisms and not to any impact upon the peripheral lesion.\r"

The post-operative clinical improvement as regards rhinorrhea and sneezing was not as marked as that for nasal obstruction.

They comprised 9 females and 6 males and ranged in age from 6 to 35 years, with a mean of 15 years. Tonsillectomy was performed under general anaesthesia. The mean number of pain crises in the one-year period after tonsillectomy was 1.5 and was significantly less than the mean number 4.7 in the one year preceding the operation (p less than 0.001). Four patients failed to show a reduced number of crises and these were those whose tonsils at operation showed no pus in their tonsillar crypts. It is thus observed that chronic tonsillitis, symptoms of which may not be volunteered at examination, is a potent inductor of sickle cell pain crisis and that tonsillectomy is an effective mode of treatment, especially when the tonsillar crypts contain pus.\r"

In patients in the stroke age bracket, however, who present with a history of neurologic deficit, transient ischemic attacks can be confused with migraine accompaniments. The typical patient is 50 years old, is without a past history of migraines, and complains of scintillating visual disturbances (20 percent), marching paresthesis (22 percent), or a myriad of neurologic deficits. In one series of 70 neurology patients aged over 55 years, 16 percent reported that they experience the new onset of scintillations. Once fully evaluated, the cause of unexplained marching paresthesias, dysphagia, or hemiplegia, once reserved for thrombotic or embolic phenomena, may be attributed to migraine accompaniments. In the face of a normal evaluation, neurologic deficit in the stroke age bracket may be attributed to migraine accompaniments. A case of a 47-year-old woman with sudden onset of left-sided paresthesia, dysarthria, and confusion is presented. The discussion includes a description of migraine pathophysiology and a review of concepts regarding accompaniments.\r"

There is a lack of research evidence, however, to document the value of such cultures in all settings. In this retrospective study of gonorrhea cultures in a family practice, all of the cultures performed in one year were reviewed. Of the 219 clinically asymptomatic women who had screening cultures ordered, only two (0.9 percent) had culture-positive results, and both were known to be recent contacts of men with confirmed gonorrhea and hence would have had a screening culture ordered anyway. This finding opens to serious question the value of routinely screening women for gonorrhea by culturing vaginal specimens in all circumstances and suggests that thorough history and examination alone, supplemented by cultures only when clinically indicated, would suffice in certain settings.\r"

A control wound remained untreated. All wounds were covered with an occlusive dressing after treatment. The time to healing (100 percent epithelialization) was evaluated for each wound. Wounds were cultured for bacterial growth after two treatments. Contaminated blister wounds treated with the triple antibiotic ointment healed significantly faster (mean nine days) than wounds treated with any antiseptic and those receiving no treatment. Only the neomycin-polymyxin B-bacitracin combination effectively eliminated bacterial contamination of the wounds after two applications (within 16 to 24 hours after contamination with Staphylococcus aureus). The overall clinical appearance and healing rates of wounds treated with the triple antibiotic were ranked superior to all treatments (and no treatment) except the other antibiotic ointment in the study.\r"

Ninety-two difficult patients were identified by asking physicians to indicate those patients whose care they considered difficult. Charts of 166 randomly selected patients were then compared with those of the difficult patients. The difficult patient group was older, more often divorced or widowed, and had a higher percentage of women than the random patient group. The difficult patient group also had more acute problems, chronic problems, medications, x-ray examinations, blood tests, physician referrals, and visits to the family practice center. After covariance analysis adjusting for age and sex, significant differences remained between the two groups for chronic problems, blood tests, medications, and visits to the family practice center. The two patient groups did not differ significantly in household composition, payment status, or provider continuity. The data suggest that, although there are different types of difficult patients, there may be certain medical and demographic features that are common to many of them. Many physicians suspect that difficult patients suffer from a \"thick-chart syndrome,\" a syndrome confirmed to exist by this study.\r"

Respondents were also asked to indicate the relative importance of several potential sources of information on new drugs and to test their ability to recognize a list of generic and trade name drugs. Several associations were identified between physicians' sources of drug information and generic drug recognition, attitudes, and prescription patterns. The habit of prescribing mostly generic drugs, for example, was found to be more common among family physicians who were residency trained, who relied least on drug company representatives, and who were regular readers of the New England Journal of Medicine. The ability to recognize all ten generic names was found to be highest among these same groups of physicians and also among those who relied least on journal advertisements and those who were regular readers of The Medical Letter.\r"

Using a historical cohort design with chart review, rates in selected groups of patients were compared between two teaching family medicine centers, one with an on-site radiology service and one without. After controlling for confounding variables, patients with chest-related diagnoses were 2.4 times more likely (P less than .05) to have a chest film in the presence of on-site facilities. Rates for the off-site examination, upper gastrointestinal series, in patients with abdominal-related diagnoses were similar (relative risk 1.34, P greater than .5) at both centers. Higher usage brought no short-term clinical benefit. It was also observed that residents overinterpreted one quarter of chest films when compared with radiologists' reports.\r"

Diagnostic approach includes a careful physical examination of primary skin lesions and goal-directed laboratory tests. Careful skin care and oral antihistamines are basic measures to alleviate pruritus.\r"

This paper reports the findings from a survey in which all the principal components (both providers and consumers in one catchment area) contributed data about the degree to which vocational rehabilitation was integrated into systems of care for the mentally ill. The major repetitive themes found at the interface of each participating sector were: rigidity, isolation, compensatory ad hoc operations, and narrow frames of reference. Vocational and other forms of rehabilitation were accomplished by persistent, energetic personnel inventing ingenious solutions to the roadblocks set up at system interfaces. Their problem-solving techniques pointed to ingredients that might help to integrate treatment and rehabilitation efforts. These key elements were flexibility, collaboration, data-based training, and a unified theoretical framework.\r"

The results showed good subscale alpha coefficients, test-retest reliability, and face and construct validity. Differences in patients' and nonpatients' perceptions of social support were examined. The influence of demographic factors on both groups' responses to the support measure were assessed. In a second study, the support scale's concurrent and predictive validity were tested. Forty-two patients treated in brief, dynamic psychotherapy completed the scale pre- and posttreatment. Patients' perceptions of supportive relationships pretreatment were associated with pretreatment self-report ratings of symptoms and social adjustment and posttreatment changes in social adjustment. Also, posttreatment responses on the support measures were significantly more positive than were pretreatment perceptions of the quantity and quality of social support.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the literature on the comprehensive description of depressive patients revealed prominent concern with syndromic subtypes, course of illness, and personality factors, followed by severity, concomitant physical disorders, psychosocial stressors, and adaptive functioning. The descriptive value of multiaxial approaches for depression was illustrated through the application of an extended DSM-III formulation to all 3455 depressive (bipolar depression, major depression, dysthymic disorder, and atypical depression) and 7837 nondepressive patients of all ages and sexes presenting for evaluation and care at the Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh during a period of 53 months. Twenty-six percent of the depressive patients received an additional diagnosis in axis I, the most frequent of which were substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, and condition not attributable to a mental disorder. In axis II, depressive patients presented a differentially higher frequency of dependent personality disorder and the \"anxious/fearful\" cluster of personality disorders. In axis III, 47% of the depressive vs. 40% of the nondepressive patients had a positive diagnosis of physical illness, with a significantly higher frequency among depressive patients attained by acquired hypothyroidism, migraine, essential hypertension, unspecified abdominal hernia, and unspecified arthropathies. Specific stressors differentially more frequent among depressive patients were those of conjugal, parenting, and occupational types and those reflecting the impact of physical illness. Overall stressor severity was at severe, extreme, or catastrophic levels for 42% of the depressive and 31% of the nondepressive patients. The highest level of adaptive functioning in the past year was good, very good, or superior for 44% of the depressive and 29% of the nondepressive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data were collected from 744 university students. Only 15% of subjects without loss vs. 44% with both types of loss had Beck Depression Inventory scores indicative of moderate depression. Analysis of variance confirmed this strong interaction effect. These results provide empirical support for Freud's view that a recent loss can reactivate depressive feelings associated with earlier loss.\r"

There is agreement that earlier findings of performance deficits among offspring of schizophrenics and among schizophrenics in remission may not extend to more foveal, as opposed to peripheral, presentations of visual arrays of the SOA task. Using the former format of presentation, the current study found that performance of episodic patients was distinguishable from that of nonpatient controls but performance of remitted patients was not. Readings of psychophysiological activity (heart rate) obtained during SOA task performance were higher among episodic patients than among others, suggesting that such measures may be promising markers of episodes of schizophrenia.\r"

The features that enabled a diagnosis of hysterical paraplegia to be arrived at were: They were predominantly paraplegic, There was a high incidence of previous psychiatric illness and employment in the Health Service or allied professions, Many were actively seeking compensation. The physical findings were a disproportionate motor paralysis, non anatomical sensory loss, the presence of downgoing plantar responses, normal tone and reflexes. They made a rapid total recovery. In contrast, the control traumatic cases showed an incomplete recovery and a persistent residual neurological deficit. Investigations apart from plain radiographs of the spinal column were not warranted, and the diagnosis should be possible on clinical grounds alone.\r"

Compared with oculocephalic response testing, VOR analysis provided more evidence and allowed more precise study of ocular motility in comatose patients. In 25 patients (31%) without conclusive or with absent oculocephalic response, a preserved VOR could be seen. The results indicated that in all cases with preserved VOR response (independent of the cause of coma) the assumption of a good outcome is justified and was correct in a maximum of 67%. The unpredictability in the other cases was largely due to non-neurological factors. Ninety two per cent of the patients with abolished reflex eye movements died. The combination of absent VOR and abolished pupillary light reaction allows prediction of negative outcome in 100% and shows the paramount importance of these two brainstem reflexes.\r"

In normotensive normocapnic animals the volume of infarction was 52 +/- 4 mm3 in the cerebral cortex and 21 +/- 1 mm3 in the corpus striatum. The reproducibility of the volumetric assessment was found to be excellent (coefficient of correlation 0.995 on 18 replicate measurements). The minimum number of stereotactic levels which must be assessed to yield accurate volumetric measurements of infarction is 8. The method is sensitive at detecting alterations in the amount of infarction. For example, it can readily detect the increase in amount of structural damage in cerebral cortex following a transient episode of hypotension. This approach allows an objective assessment of drug therapy and management strategies in the treatment of cerebral infarction.\r"

  ".W": "In 80 controls latencies of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and in 94 controls latencies of soleus H-reflexes correlated well with length of the extremity, body height and age. Multiple regression equations using latency as a variable dependent on age and body height can be best used in practice when both reflexes are employed for demonstration of proximal pathology. The majority (69%) of 93 patients with various polyneuropathies showed abnormalities in both reflexes illustrating that proximal nerve segments are frequently involved. Four per cent had abnormal FCR H-reflexes with normal soleus H-reflexes whereas the reverse was found in 19% of the patients. Abnormal FCR H-reflexes occurred with normal motor and sensory conduction velocities in the peripheral part of the median nerve in 14%, whereas the reverse was seen in 12%, indicating that FCR H-reflex examination is a valuable supplement to conventional conduction studies for detection of electrophysiologically existing pathology.\r"

Cooling of the muscle caused a severe reduction in the EMG and force which accompanied either voluntary effort or tetanic nerve stimulation, but it had little effect on the response to single stimuli. The ineffectual attempts at voluntary contraction of the cooled muscle did, however, block the response to single nerve stimuli. Administration of cholinesterase inhibitors did not improve neuromuscular transmission in the cooled muscle, but usually made it worse. It is concluded that depolarisation block may contribute to the weakness of cooled denervated muscles.\r"

The relative proportions of the different forms of each enzyme and of AChE to BChE were similar in CSF and brain. AChE decreased in Huntington's chorea (degeneration of striatal cholinergic interneurons) but also in multiple sclerosis (not known to affect cholinergic systems).

There were six patients with motor aprosodia, one with global aprosodia, two with conduction aprosodia, one with sensory aprosodia, one with transcortical sensory aprosodia, one with pure affective deafness and two with normal examinations of affect. Functional-anatomical correlations were consistent with those predicted previously. Recovery of affective language function in selected cases was characterised by improvements in affective-prosodic repetition and/or evolution into other aprosodic subtypes. Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that the organisation of affective language in the right hemisphere mirrors that of propositional language in the left hemisphere.\r"

  ".U": "87225006\r", 
  ".W": "Amplitude/frequency characteristics of postural hand tremor in 59 patients with bilateral essential tremor of various degrees of severity were assessed using accelerometric recordings and spectral analysis. Intra-subject comparisons of tremor characteristics between the more and less affected hands were used to control for variability of tremor due to age factors and intersubject differences in amplitude and frequency. Statistical analysis distinguished three different patient groups. Some patients had low amplitude (less than 0.1-0.015 cm) tremor in the less affected limb (which tended to be 7 Hz or more in frequency in the young) and a larger amplitude tremor in the more affected hand which was 1 Hz or more lower in frequency. Other subjects had either bilaterally small or bilaterally large amplitude tremors of similar frequencies. These findings imply that there is a downwards step in frequency between symptomatic tremors of small and large amplitude. The amplitude and frequency of the small amplitude tremors were unrelated but frequency declined with age. The frequency of the large amplitude tremor was generally determined by amplitude but a wide range of amplitudes were compatible with similar frequencies. The frequency of large amplitude tremor also declined with age. It was concluded that there are two types of essential tremor, the smaller amplitude tremor probably derives from an exaggeration of some or all of the mechanisms of normal physiological tremor whereas the larger amplitude tremor probably arises from a separate \"pathological\" central nervous mechanism. It is not known if or how one may transform into, or be replaced by, the other during progression of the disease.\r"

Wrist tremor was recorded by an accelerometer fixed to the dorsum of the hand and demodulated surface EMG was recorded from the wrist extensors, while the extended hand was loaded with successively heavier weights. Physiological tremor was characterised by flat EMG spectra and a gradual decrease in tremor peak frequency with increasing load, as would be expected from the properties of a passive spring-mass-system. Also the peak frequency of activated physiological tremor characterised by increased synchronisation between motor units decreased in frequency with increasing loads. EMG spectra showed clear peaks of activity at the various mechanically determined tremor frequencies. In contrast, in two pathological tremor forms, the postural tremor in Parkinsonian patients and essential tremor, peak frequency tended to remain stable irrespective of changes in load. The method therefore allows a simple distinction between physiological and these two pathological tremors.\r"

  ".U": "87225008\r", 
  ".W": "Three patients with spasmodic torticollis following VIII nerve lesions (VIII-ST) underwent quantitative assessment of their sternomastoid EMG during vestibular (otolith and semicircular canal) stimulation. The results were compared with a normal control group and with six patients with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis (ST). Backwards tilt of the VIII-ST patients resulted in a marked increase in the EMG, especially in the more affected sternomastoid, whereas this manoeuvre did not have a significant effect in normal subjects, or had a variable effect in the ST group. These results suggest that those with torticollis following VIII nerve lesions are a distinct group. Since there was no relationship between the side of the VIII nerve lesion and the direction of the torticollis a direct aetiological link between the two is, however, unlikely. The unusual EMG/tilt responses are explained on the basis of peripheral imbalance of utricular signals (maximal in the supine position) in the presence of central deranged processing of information concerning head posture.\r"

In MND patients, F-response frequency varied between 5% and 96% with a median of 39% which was significantly lower than controls (p less than 0.001), and showed a significant rank correlation with the M-response amplitude (r = 0.62, p less than 0.004). Identical responses occurred more frequently than in controls (median 30.8%, p less than 0.001). F-response frequency was normal in CS patients (median 76.3%, range 35% to 97%), but the frequency of identical responses (median 6.3%) was higher than normal (p less than 0.01). Reduced F-response frequency in MND was thought to reflect loss of lower motor neurons, while the presence of spasticity was probably the major factor underlying the increased frequency of identical responses in both disorders. F-response shape tended to be simpler in MND and rather more complex in CS patients than controls.\r"

Three patients had radiological findings demonstrating a second lesion of the lower spine. The remaining 15 patients, however, did not have any obvious bony lesion to account for the lumbosacral dysfunction. Atypical neurological findings, abnormal neurophysiological testing and aberrant detrusor behaviour were the essence of the occult lumbosacral dysfunction in cervical and thoracic spinal cord injury patients. Recognition of the presence of a double lesion was important for care of the neuropathic bladder and pain in addition to understanding the unexpected clinical signs.\r"

It is suggested that bilateral destruction of the lingual gyrus alone is not sufficient to affect complex visual processing. The fusiform gyrus probably has a critical role in colour integration, visuo-spatial processing, facial recognition and corresponding visual imagery. Involvement of the occipitotemporal projection system deep to the lingual gyri probably explained visual memory dysfunction, by a visuo-limbic disconnection. Impaired verbal memory may have been due to posterior involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus and underlying white matter, which may have disconnected the intact speech areas from the left medial temporal structures.\r"

Each displayed several characteristic features. First, the onset was in early adulthood. Second, there was a unique distribution of muscle involvement: tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum and hallucis muscles were initially and most severely affected. The hamstrings and adductors of the thigh were also markedly involved. The gluteus medius and minimus muscles and the neck flexors were mildly affected in the relatively early stages. In contrast, the gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps femoris, and gluteus maximus muscles were well preserved until an advanced stage. Third, serum creatine kinase activity was normal or only mildly elevated; fourth, EMG were mainly myopathic, with certain neuropathic features; and fifth, histopathologically rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers were found associated with certain \"neuropathic\" features, such as angular fibers, clustering of atrophic fibers, pyknotic nuclear clumps, and fiber-type predominance. The characteristic distribution of skeletal muscle involvement was particularly noticeable, together with certain \"neuropathic\" features of the EMG and muscle biopsy in rimmed vacuolar distal myopathy.\r"

The earliest changes noted were focal proliferation of the Golgi's apparatus and mitochondrial degeneration with myofibrillar loss. A proliferation of the T-system appeared later. Secondary lysosomes (autophagosomes) could be noted much later and gradually increased in number. Autophagosomes tended to coalesce and became larger autophagic vacuoles, which were surrounded in part by relatively preserved myofibrils and partly by a single membrane. Gently curved laminated structures (tubulomembranous structures) were seen in the degenerating muscle fibers and also in relatively intact fibers, satellite cells, and interstitial cells in all cases. They were closely associated with lipofuscin-like material. These findings suggest that an abnormality of the lysosomal system might be essential in the pathogenesis of rimmed vacuolar distal myopathy.\r"

Neuropathological observations of the brain of persons suffering from concussion after relatively minor head injury, as well as of animals subjected to experimental brain injury, have shown that alterations of the blood-brain barrier constitute a common result of such trauma. It is postulated that the alterations of the blood-brain barrier secondary to trauma of the brain or spinal cord of patients with already established multiple sclerosis may result in an exacerbation or recurrence of a previously symptomatic plaque, in the appearance of symptoms from a silent lesion, or in the formation of a new plaque in such an area of selected vulnerability. In other persons injury to the nervous system may cause the development of multiple sclerosis plaques in the previously damaged areas when the disease has its onset after the trauma. There is no evidence to support the idea that trauma ever causes multiple sclerosis.\r"

Ipsilateral pursuit movements were also impaired. These findings suggest that the parieto-occipital region may be critical for generating all visually evoked eye movements. The full-field pursuit was more impaired than the foveal pursuit; this unusual dissociation may occur when the lesion involves more the interhemispheric than the intrahemispheric occipito-parietal connecting fibres.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 95 families, consisting of 317 patients with severe and mild X-linked proximal pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy (MD), was analysed by the use of two different and rigid clinical criteria based on the age when the patient became chairbound. Using these criteria the families from Erfurt and Warsaw could be clearly separated into classical Duchenne (DMD) and classical Becker (BMD) type patients. A third group of patients was found with atypical clinical course, who could not be identified as neither Duchenne nor Becker cases. Statistically highly significant differences were found between the groups of classical DMD and atypical MD cases on the one hand and between the groups of atypical MD and classical BMD cases on the other, especially with respect to age when chairbound and age at death. The comparisons of progression of the disease, life expectancy and of fertility between the three groups of X-linked MD show that classical DMD and atypical MD may be considered as separate types of severe X-linked proximal pseudohypertrophic MD. On the basis of these findings the authors offer conclusions for the general practice of neurology, paediatrics and genetic counseling.\r"

Adults in all age groups can be affected and present with progressive signs and symptoms of spinal cord or cauda equina compression. The dorsal aspect of the thoracic spine is most commonly involved, usually in its total extent. Spine radiographs are normal and myelography poorly delineates the nature and extent of abnormality. While computed tomography can provide information about the nature of the spinal mass, magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice. Extensive decompressive laminectomy is useful but the results are variable. Correction of underlying endocrine abnormality can reverse the process. The need for early diagnosis of this disorder is therefore emphasized.\r"

In the two patients with Shy-Drager syndrome these changes were not present and the only significant finding was the more pronounced type I fibre atrophy, with type II fibre predominance in the more severely affected case. These findings do not permit the vocal cord paralysis seen in the Shy-Drager syndrome to be explained by motorneuron loss and denervation.

The breathing of pure oxygen often results in higher calculated Qs/Qt values that have been attributed to the development of atelectasis, ventilation-perfusion imbalance, or both. To interpret properly the changes in calculated Qs/Qt that occur when the inspired oxygen fraction is altered, the changes produced in all the variables affecting Qs/Qt must be known. This tutorial presents an in-depth analysis of the four variables affecting the calculation of Qs/Qt: VO2 (oxygen uptake), Qt (cardiac output), Cc'O2 (oxygen content in pulmonary end capillaries), and CvO2 (oxygen content in mixed venous blood). These variables are related according to the following equation, which is derived by combining the Fick and the classic shunt equations: Qs/Qt = 1 - [(VO2/Qt)/(Cc'O2 - CvO2)]. Three-dimensional surface representations relating these variables are also presented to help the reader understand the effects of these variables on the calculated Qs/Qt.\r"

Hypotension was induced in 10 mongrel dogs and maintained for 2 hours, either by an anesthesiologist or by the computer controller. Challenges to homeostasis were given during the 2-hour period. The computer brought the mean arterial pressure to the desired value in an average of 4.1 minutes compared with 6.3 minutes for the anesthesiologists, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference between the computer and the anesthesiologists for 25 performance criteria. The anesthesiologists performed better during two imposed hypertensive perturbations by turning off the sodium nitroprusside sooner when the pressure rapidly decreased. In general, the computer controller performed as well as experienced anesthesiologists who devoted full attention to the control of blood pressure.\r"

The patients in the nonrelaxant group showed a mild depression to 77% of initial hand grip force by the time they could hold up their heads for 5 seconds. Patients in the relaxant group had a mean of only 29% of initial hand grip force when they could lift their heads. One hour later, hand grip force increased to 76% of preoperative force in the relaxant group. Hand grip force appears to be a sensitive measurement of residual relaxant effect.\r"

A steep decrease in arterial blood oxygen tension was obvious immediately after the institution of one-lung ventilation, reaching the lowest mean value of 63 +/- 2 mm Hg (+/- SEM) at 12 minutes. Despite significant correlation between transcutaneous oxygen tension and arterial blood oxygen tension during one-lung ventilation (r = 0.75; P less than 0.001), the delay in the transcutaneous oxygen tension response resulted in underestimation of the severity of hypoxemia at the beginning of one-lung ventilation. In contrast, the decrease in arterial blood oxygen saturation from 97.9 +/- 0.3% to 92.2 +/- 0.8% as measured by CO-Oximeter was accurately followed by pulse oximetry with almost beat-to-beat response, bringing about a highly significant linear correlation between the two methods (r = 0.93; P less than 0.001). We conclude that pulse oximetry is a simpler and more rapidly responding method than measurement of transcutaneous oxygen tension for detection of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation in adults.\r"

One hundred newborn infants, weighing 850 to 5,230 g each, delivered vaginally or by cesarean section with general or epidural anesthesia were studied. After delivery, each infant was placed in a radiant warmer, and a pulse oximetry probe was placed on the right hand. Hemoglobin saturation was then recorded for 15 minutes. Initial pulse oximetry values were obtained in less than one minute after cord clamping in 43% of infants, less than two minutes in 81%, and less than three minutes in 98%. Average arterial oxygen saturation was 59% at 1 minute (43 infants), 68% at 2 minutes (81), 82% at 5 minutes (98), and 90% at 15 minutes (91). Oxygen saturation was less than 30% in 12 neonates and less than 50% in 26 neonates at some time during the 15-minute monitoring period. Oxygen saturation did not differ significantly between neonates delivered vaginally or by cesarean section, regardless of the presence or type of anesthetic used. Arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry showed a statistically significant relationship when compared with the traditional Apgar scoring system. Pulse oximetry was found to be very useful in objectively judging the adequacy of resuscitative efforts, as well as in identifying children who had marked arterial desaturation during the early neonatal period.\r"

  ".W": "This study addressed two major questions regarding therapeutic use of Adriamycin ([Adr] Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) in adult soft tissue sarcomas: the influence of dosing schedule and the value of adding imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) to Adr. Patients with objectively measurable metastatic soft tissue sarcomas were randomized to Adr 70 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 and every 3 weeks (94 patients); Adr 20 mg/m2 IV day 1, 2, and 3, and 15 mg/m2 IV day 8 and weekly thereafter (89 patients); and Adr 60 mg/m2 IV day 1 and DTIC 250 mg/m2 days 1 to 5, repeated every 3 weeks (92 patients). The regimens using Adr as a single agent resulted in an equivalent response frequency (18% and 16%) and survival (median, 8.0 and 8.4 months). DTIC significantly increased (P less than .02) the overall response frequency of Adr to 30%. However, DTIC did not influence survival (median, 8.0 months) or increase the number of complete responses. The toxicities of the two single-agent regimens differed: Adr weekly resulted in more stomatitis (P = .09) and less hematologic toxicity (P less than .05). DTIC resulted in substantially increased toxicity, primarily gastrointestinal (P less than .002); overall, 98% of patients receiving Adr-DTIC experienced moderate or worse toxicity. To decrease the potential for error in interpretation of treatment results, histopathological confirmation of diagnosis was undertaken by a panel of reference pathologists; pathology slides were submitted on 97% of entered patients. The on-study clinical diagnosis was affirmed in 199 of 316 patients (63%) with a final review. In 23% of patients, the panel agreed with the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, but not with the type. In 14%, the panel concluded that a diagnosis of mesenchymal malignancy could not be affirmed. Final treatment results were based on the 275 pathologically confirmed, eligible patients. The most common histological subtype entered was leiomyosarcoma (99 patients). The response to Adr-DTIC of this subtype was higher (44%) than that of any other subtype. However, this difference alone was not responsible for the overall superiority of the combination. This confirmed that the combination of DTIC plus Adr adds to the response rate of Adr alone in soft tissue sarcomas. Whether the increased response frequency, without an impact on survival, is worth the significantly greater toxicity remains a subjective judgement that must be made within the context of the individual patient.\r"

Three patients are too early to evaluate (on study less than or equal to 2 months with no change in tumor status). Objective responses (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in measurable disease) occurred in 14 of 42 evaluable patients (33.3%) (the 95% confidence interval based on this rate is +/- 14.3%), with three complete responses and 11 partial responses (PR). Complete responses lasted 9.5, 4+, and 9.5+ months. The median duration of response for the PR group was 5 months (range, 4 to 21+ months). Twelve patients experienced stabilization of disease ranging from 4 to 16.5+ months. No response was seen in 16 patients. There was no symptomatic, hematologic, or chemical (organ dysfunction) toxicity among the 45 patients treated.

The association of gastrointestinal (GI) and Waldeyer's ring lymphoma and the unique lymphocyte migration pattern of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) have been previously described. To establish whether predictive clinical patterns of disease occur in localized Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, survival and relapse patterns for 496 patients with stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with loco-regional irradiation (XRT) alone were examined. We identified 139 patients with GALT lymphoma (defined as arising from primitive gut and including Waldeyers' ring, thyroid, and GI lymphomas) and 87 patients with extranodal non-gut-associated lymphoma (ENL). Survival and relapse data were assessed in multifactorial analysis to correct for previously identified other prognostic variables. GALT lymphomas (GALT-L) have a survival advantage compared with other ENL (P = .017) independent of stage and histology. A difference in distant relapse (DR) rate between GALT-L and other ENL (P = .0002) was also identified. The presentation site of localized extranodal NHL is predictive of clinical behavior and is an independent determinant of outcome. This may be an expression of lymphocytic origin and determinants of migration patterns.\r"

Patients without prior chemotherapy with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-unknown disease were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) or surgical oophorectomy followed directly by CAF (O + CAF). ER-negative patients without prior chemotherapy were directly assigned to treatment with CAF. Among randomized patients 83% have responded, and 37% have achieved a complete remission. Among ER-negative patients the complete response rate was 38%, and the complete plus partial response rate was 70%. Characteristics significantly associated with a longer time to treatment failure were age 45 or over, one or two organ sites, and performance status O. The median survival time of ER-positive patients treated with CAF is 29 months, and with O + CAF it has not yet been reached, whereas for ER-unknown patients the equivalent survival times are 41 months and 43 months respectively. For ER-negative patients treated with CAF the median survival time is 17 months. Characteristics associated with significantly longer survival among randomized patients were age 35 or over (P = .009) and only one or two organ sites involved (P = .02). Neither treatment (P = .33) nor ER status (P = .70) was significant.\r"

The possibility that colony formation by progenitor cells in these tumors may reflect a more \"aggressive\" phenotype bearing clinical implications was examined in a series of 61 patients with primary breast cancer. Tumor cells from 32 samples formed colonies in vitro. There was no correlation between colony formation and any of the standard clinical parameters such as tumor size, nodal status, metastatic spread, or hormone receptor levels. Eighteen patients had inflammatory, locally advanced and/or detectable metastatic breast cancer at the time of surgery. Sixteen of these patients have progressed and 15 have died, with no relationship between colony formation and survival. For the 43 remaining patients, 23 had a tissue sample that gave rise to colonies in vitro; 14 of these have relapsed, with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 37.6 months, and eight have died with a median survival time of 46.8 months. This is compared with four relapses (median RFS not reached, P = .0043, Peto-Pike), and four deaths (median not reached, P = .1175) in the group without growth of the tumor specimen. These results indicate that colony formation is an independent prognostic parameter for breast cancer, which may be useful for selecting patients who would benefit from more intensive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective long-term analysis of the results of primary postoperative radiotherapy in 106 women with invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma is presented. Forty-two women received open-field total abdominopelvic irradiation, and 64 received treatment by various subtotal abdominopelvic techniques. The mean follow-up of living patients in the two groups is 86 and 116 months, respectively. Women who had Federation International Gynecology and Oncology (FIGO) stages I through III-A with no postoperative residual disease, or less than 0.5-cm abdominal and/or less than 2-cm pelvic residual disease formed a favorable group in whom total abdominopelvic irradiation resulted in a 71% 10-year actuarial relapse-free survival rate compared with 40% for those treated by subtotal abdominopelvic techniques (P less than or equal to .0205). The survival improvement due to the total abdominopelvic technique in favorable patients became even more significant (P less than or equal to 0.003) after adjusting for differences in stage, grade, and postoperative residual disease volume (no, or favorable, gross). Increasing grade appeared to be associated with decreasing survival even among favorable patients treated with the optimal technique, although the differences did not approach statistical significance after adjusting for residual disease volume and stage. Surgical bowel complications were equivalent, 7.1% for total abdominopelvic v 8.1% for subtotal abdominopelvic techniques. The addition of intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate increased the surgical bowel complication rate 33% over external pelvic irradiation alone without improving survival. Patients with unfavorable gross residual disease and/or FIGO stages III-B and IV were incurable by any radiation technique. Those with no, or favorable, gross residual tumor constitute a group in whom we believe open-field total abdominopelvic irradiation represents a potentially curative therapy modality.\r"

  ".W": "In order to test the toxicity and efficacy of intensive postremission therapy with high-dose cytosine arabinoside with L-asparaginase and amsacrine with etoposide in adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANL), 100 adults (ages 19 to 75) with previously untreated ANL were entered into a study using six sequential cycles of chemotherapy. Cycles 1 (induction), 3, and 5 included conventional doses of daunomycin, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, vincristine (VCR), and prednisone. Cycle 2 was cytosine arabinoside 3 g/m2 intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for four doses, followed by L-asparaginase 10,000 U intramuscularly (IM) at hour 42; this combination was repeated 1 week later. Cycle 4 included amsacrine 120 mg/m2/d and etoposide 100 mg/m2/d, both IV for five days, and cycle 6 was three monthly courses of VCR on day 1, and prednisone, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate each for five days. Seventy-four patients (74%) achieved complete remission (CR) (51 with cycle 1 and 23 after cycle 2). The overall disease-free survival (DFS) for patients achieving CR is 27% at 3 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis, while for patients achieving CR with cycle 1 it is 34%. The actuarial probability of being free from relapse at 3 years for patients achieving CR is 34%. Sixteen of the 74 CR patients (22%) died in CR while continuing to receive intensive chemotherapy, including 12 (18%) who succumbed to infection (nine bacterial, three fungal). After a median follow-up of 20 months, 36 patients have relapsed and 21 remain alive in CR. Intensive consolidation with high-dose cytosine arabinoside, amsacrine, and etoposide can modestly prolong DFS compared with historical controls. However, relapse continued to be a major problem and, in addition, with more aggressive consolidation therapy, infection during marrow aplasia resulted in a significant number of deaths.\r"

  ".W": "CNS dysfunction, especially impaired cerebellar function, is the dose-limiting toxicity associated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside, which precludes doses of greater than 48 g/m2. Four hundred eighteen patients between the ages of 2 and 74 years with leukemia or lymphoma received 36 to 48 g/m2 cytosine arabinoside either alone or with anthracycline antibiotics, 4'-(9-acridinylamino) methane sulfon-m-anisidine (m-AMSA), or total body irradiation. In only 35 of 418 patients (8%) did severe cerebellar toxicity develop; it was irreversible or fatal in four (1%) patients. The age of the patient was a critical factor in the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity. Patients greater than 50 years old had a statistically significant greater incidence of cerebellar toxicity compared with younger patients (26/137, 19%, v 9/281, 3%; P less than .0005, chi 2). Neither the diagnosis, disease status, sex, nor the regimen altered the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity (when corrected for age). A second course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, administered to 62 patients, did not increase the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity, which occurred in five (8%) of these patients. Two of the five patients had severe toxicity with the initial course. Of the 60 patients with no antecedent cerebellar dysfunction, three (5%) had severe toxicity with the second course: one of 41 patients were less than 50 years old; two of 19 patients were greater than or equal to 50 years. Since the occurrence of severe cerebellar dysfunction is greatly affected by age, reduced doses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside should be given to patients greater than 50 years old, and methods for reducing the cerebellar toxicity should be investigated in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven children or adolescents with initial stage IV (42 patients) or stage III (five) advanced neuroblastoma (12 were progressing after relapse and 35 had never reached complete remission [CR] after conventional therapy) were included in a phase II study of the combination of high-dose VP-16 (100 mg/m2/d X 5) and high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) (40 mg/m2/d X 5). Twenty patients had received prior CDDP therapy (total dose, 100 to 640 mg/m2; median, 320 mg/m2) and 38 of 47 had bone marrow involvement when included in the study. The overall response rate was 55%, with 22% CR. Duration of response was 5 to 18 months, with a median of 10 months. Eight patients are still disease free, with a median observation time of 13 months, but all had received additional therapy after two courses of this regimen. Gastrointestinal toxicity was frequent but tolerable. Myelosuppression was severe but of brief duration, ie, nadir of neutrophils was observed at day 15 with 95% of the patients recovering a normal count before day 28, and nadir of platelet count was at day 17 with only two severe and reversible episodes of bleeding. The overall incidence of sepsis was 8% (seven of 92 courses), with no death related to infection. No acute renal failure was observed after two courses, and only three of 47 children experienced a clear reduction of renal function. After two courses, only two children showed a hearing loss in the 1,000 to 2,000 Hz range, although hearing loss above the 2,000 Hz level was frequently encountered. It is concluded that high-dose VP-16 and CDDP is an effective regimen in advanced neuroblastoma with acceptable toxicity. Phase III studies are needed in previously untreated patients.

Six of the nine patients who received PAF in the neoadjuvant setting did not respond and proceeded to surgery and/or radiation therapy. No difference in response rate was found between those patients treated for recurrent disease v those treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All three patients with adenocarcinoma responded. The response duration in patients with metastatic or recurrent disease ranged from 6 to 15 months. The PAF regimen was delivered primarily in the outpatient setting and was associated with acceptable toxicity. PAF demonstrates activity in salivary gland malignancies, and further evaluation of this combination seems warranted.\r"

The inherent slow-release character of MSC was confirmed by 2 1/2 X T1/2 absorption rate, one-half Cmax, and twice Tmax relative to IRMS. The T1/2 elimination of the two morphine preparations was similar, demonstrating insignificant risk of MSC accumulation. The difference in the mean number of side effects experienced by the control group per subject was significant (.70 for MSC and 1.26 for IRMS, P = .05) and was consistent with peak plasma morphine attenuation. The cancer patients were initially switched from their previous analgesic to four hourly IRMS and then to MSC at double the dose every eight hours. The majority had their MSC dosing interval lengthened to every 12 hours with a decrease in the total daily morphine requirement. While the mean duration on MSC was 20.5 days, many patients were followed poststudy for an extended period with no appreciable development of tolerance. Overall, MSC analgesia and side effects were perceived by the patients as superior compared with prestudy opioids. The advantage of less frequent dosing may lead to improvement of the quality of life of cancer patients.\r"

Using a newly synthesized BCA, a p-carboxyethylphenylglyoxal-di(N-methylthiosemicarbazone) (CE-DTS), the coupling and technetium-99m (99mTc) labeling of monoclonal IgG against hCG were carried out. In the system presented, factors affecting stability and immunoreactivity were examined. Immunoreactivity of the original IgG (56C) was preserved by conjugating one CE-DTS molecule per molecule of IgG (56C) using the phosphorylazide method, however, 99mTc labeling pH affected the immunoreactivity and limited the 99mTc labeling reaction between pH 4.5 and 6.2. A screening of labeling conditions, such as pH, reaction time, and reducing agent system were then carried out. Technetium-99m-labeled IgG (56C), [99mTc]CE-DTS-IgG (56C), showed good stability upon incubation with mice sera and comparable mice biodistribution to that of indium-111 (111In) DTPA-IgG (56C).

Regurgitant fractions were calculated from differences between the FP right and left ventricular stroke volumes. Ejection fractions determined by FP were precise (mean CV = 9.6% RVEF, 13.4% LVEF). Mean LVEF by FP and ER were essentially identical, and both were lower than by CA. LVEF(FP) correlated with LVEF by ER and CA (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). Mean RVEF by both FP and ER were also correlated (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001). There was correlation between FP (corrected) and CA left ventricular stroke (r = 0.77), end-diastolic (r = 0.88), and end-systolic (r = 0.91) volumes, but underestimates were noted when uncorrected flows were used (r = 0.52-0.71). The FP regurgitant fraction measurements separated the patients with regurgitant valvular disease from those without and agreed well with CA grading of regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "Bone mineral mass was measured in normal subjects and osteoporotic patients at two forearm sites (proximal and distal of the 8 mm site between the two forearm bones) by single photon absorptiometry and in the spine and whole body by dual photon absorptiometry. There were no signs of preferential low spinal bone mass in 28 patients with vertebral fractures. Their bone mass was at all sites 26% to 37% lower than the premenopausal mean value and 7% to 13% lower than in age-matched normal women. In 45 patients with forearm fractures bone reduction was also universal but only 3% to 6% lower than in healthy women of comparable age. The spinal bone mass in all the patients was significantly related to both forearm measurements with coefficients of correlation of 0.58-0.61 and s.e.e. of 18%. Compared to the premenopausal normal range the distal forearm site had a greater sensitivity in identifying patients with vertebral fractures than had the spinal measurement (chi-square test, p less than 0.01). We thus conclude that patients with vertebral fractures have universal osteoporosis and that measurement of spinal BMC had no predictive advantages over that of the forearm bone mass for population studies.\r"

Use of the criterion of absence of [99mTc]IDA activity in the gastrointestinal tract by 24 hr, as well as application of the more recently used criterion of normal hepatic extraction, failed to differentiate patients with biliary atresia from those with SOD. Septo-optic dysplasia has clinical and scintigraphic features unique from other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Identification of the patients with SOD, in a group of 44 infants being evaluated for neonatal jaundice, improved the overall specificity of hepatobiliary scintigraphy in neonatal jaundice from 65% to 79% and accuracy in identification of patients with biliary atresia from 82% to 90%. Recognition of SOD is important to prevent unnecessary surgical exploration of these patients.\r"

  ".U": "87225204\r", 
  ".W": "Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) locates most pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas. The tracer is concentrated in intracellular storage vesicles by an active process. Many other neuroendocrine tumors of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) series have hormonal storage vesicles and, thus, the potential to take up [131I]MIBG. A variety of neuroendocrine tumors in 57 patients were studied 1, 2, and 3 days after 0.5 mCi [131I]MIBG. Views from skull to pelvis were obtained. Results of MIBG scans were compared with all available imaging modalities (including plain radiography, liver scan, ultrasound, computed tomography, and angiography) and surgical exploration. The neuroendocrine nature of the tumor was determined by histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and the assay of appropriate biogenic amines and peptide hormones. Results were (positive/total cases): carcinoids (four of ten), nonsecreting paragangliomas (three of three), sporadic medullary carcinomas of the thyroid (MCT) (one of five), familial MCT (one of 26), chemodectomas (two of five), oat cell carcinomas (zero of four), choriocarcinoma (one of one), atypical schwannoma (with storage granules) (one of one), Merkel cell skin cancer (one of one), islet cell carcinoma (zero of one). We conclude that a wide range of neuroendocrine tumors show [131I]MIBG uptake; tumors other than pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas are less often seen scintigraphically, but in certain cases (e.g., carcinoid and nonsecreting paragangliomas) scintigraphy may be useful in depicting the extent and location of disease and may indicate therapeutic potential. Iodine-131 MIBG shows promise in the diagnosis and staging of tumors of varied types.\r"

Because the dietary components were not statistically independent, they were studied in combinations of three variables. The three-variable combinations were the most useful in locating the desired maximum or minimum lipid responses in terms of the proportions of the dietary components. These analyses indicated that dietary carbohydrate, lipid and protein were better than dietary fiber for predicting the serum and liver lipid response levels. Response-surface contours and three-dimensional plots were developed for each lipid response except serum triglycerides, which were not predictable. The contours and three-dimensional plots were used to help determine those combinations of the diet components that would produce the desired maximum or minimum lipid responses. The statistical analyses indicated that the desired lipid response levels could be attained with a diet consisting of 3-5% neutral detergent bran fiber, 6-10% lipid, 54-55% carbohydrate, 26-30% protein and 4.7% vitamins and minerals.\r"

Fecal lipid elimination was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in each cocoa butter group when compared with the corresponding corn oil group, resulting in lower digestibility coefficients for cocoa butter (59-72%) than for corn oil (93-97%). Body weight gain and food intake data were similar among all treatment groups. Fecal fatty acid profiles in rats fed corn oil diets consisted primarily of 27-34% palmitic acid (16:0), 22-32% stearic acid (18:0) and 25-37% oleic acid (18:1). Palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids were also the primary fatty acids stored in epididymal fat tissue from corn oil-fed rats. In contrast, fecal fatty acids in animals fed cocoa butter diets consisted of 31-37% palmitic acid and 58-64% stearic acid; oleic acid was the major fatty acid stored in epididymal fat tissue. These results indicate that the decreased digestibility of cocoa butter is largely a result of its fatty acid composition. This reduced bioavailability of cocoa butter may be at least partially responsible for its previously described neutral effect on serum cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were fed linoleic acid from a safflower oil emulsion or triolein-supplemented total parenteral nutrition solutions by continuous intragastric infusion for 7 and 14 d. Biochemical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) developed in rats supplemented with triolein compared with those receiving linoleic acid, and the relationship between hepatic cholesterol esterification and the distribution of free cholesterol in plasma lipoproteins was investigated in the EFAD and control animals. Results indicate that hepatic triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol ester content are greater and plasma levels of TG and cholesterol are lower in triolein-supplemented groups. Hepatic accumulation of cholesterol esters is associated with an increase in hepatic acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and also with plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which contain a greater proportion of cholesterol esters. These data suggest that EFAD can be rapidly induced with continuous intragastric feeding and that hepatic accumulation of cholesterol esters and enrichment of VLDL and HDL with cholesterol esters are early indicators of EFAD in the rat.\r"

Deprivation of a methionine is known to increase the activity of RNA polymerase I. Infusing the methionine-free solution resulted in the accumulation of RNA molecules larger than 28S in the liver nuclei and resulted in a higher rate of rRNA synthesis than in rats infused with the control solution. A methionine deficiency did not impede either the processing of 45S pre-rRNA or transport of 28S and 18S rRNA into cytoplasm. When rats were infused with the methionine-free solution for 7 d followed by the control solution for 2 d, the level of RNA in the nucleus as well as the rate of RNA polymerase I were similar to the levels in rats receiving the control solution for 9 d. There were no significant changes in the rate of DNA synthesis due to nutritional manipulations.\r"

Animals fed a 8% protein diet (LP) for 4, 8 and 12 wk had a significantly lower bile flow and a lower biliary bile acid and protein secretion rate compared with rats fed a 26% protein (normal) diet (NP). The bile acid-independent fraction of bile flow was significantly increased. The slope of the regression line to zero bile acid was markedly smaller in the LP than in the NP group, indicating lower bile acid-dependent bile flow. Biliary phospholipid and cholesterol secretion rates were significantly higher in the LP than in the NP group, demonstrating an uncoupling between bile acid and lipid secretion at the low rates of bile acid secretion. The percentage increase for these parameters was of similar magnitude (30%). Absolute concentrations of bile acid, phospholipid and cholesterol were significantly higher in LP-fed rats than in NP rats, while relative concentration of bile acid was lower and those of cholesterol and phospholipid were higher. Analysis of biliary bile acids showed that the percent contribution of chenodeoxycholic acid and of deoxycholic acid increased significantly in the LP-fed rats, while that of cholic acid decreased. These data indicate that the lower bile flow in the rats fed LP can be attributed to lower bile salt-dependent flow associated with significantly lower choleretic potency of bile acids secreted.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis tested was that feeding rats sucrose rather than invert sugar (50:50 mixture of glucose and fructose) or cornstarch would result in a more rapid excretion of glucuronides and tritium from intravenously injected [1,2-3H]aldosterone. Thirty 56-d-old male rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain were fed for 8 wk one of three diets containing 45% of dietary energy from sucrose, invert sugar or cornstarch; 15% of energy was from protein and 40% from fat. Body weights and systolic blood pressures were measured weekly. After 60 d of feeding the diets ad libitum, all rats were injected intravenously with [1,2-3H]aldosterone and the percent recovery of tritium in both urine and feces was determined over the next 4 d. Urinary and fecal excretion of both free and conjugated glucuronic acid was determined over those 4 d. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium (mg/d) was also determined. There were no differences between groups in food or water intakes, body weights, systolic blood pressures, daily fecal weights and daily urine volumes. The cornstarch-fed group excreted less sodium and potassium than did the other groups (P less than 0.05). The sucrose-fed group had a greater 4-d excretion of tritium (urinary + fecal) than did the invert sugar- or cornstarch-fed groups (P less than 0.01). The sucrose-fed group had a greater percentage of excreted glucuronic acid that was conjugated (urinary + fecal) than did the invert sugar- or cornstarch-fed groups (P less than 0.05). These results tended to confirm the hypothesis.\r"

Kinetic parameters were calculated by input-output analysis of plasma [3H]ROH turnover monitored for 35 (LO and MAR) or 115 d (HI) after injection of [3H]ROH in its plasma transport complex. There was a highly significant negative correlation between fraction of dose in plasma 5 d after injection of [3H]ROH and the natural log of liver total vitamin A. The total time an average ROH molecule spent in plasma (residence time), as well as the time spent during each pass (transit time), was significantly lower in HI (0.77 d and 1.9 h) than in LO (0.98 d and 2.7 h) and MAR (0.92 d and 2.8 h) rats; however, the total time in the system (mean sojourn time) increased markedly with vitamin A status (5, 18 and 77 d). The number of times an average ROH molecule recycled through plasma before irreversible loss (7-9 times) was similar in all groups. Most of the ROH molecules (approximately 90%) that left the plasma were recycled, not irreversibly metabolized, in all groups. Among groups, ROH DR increased significantly from 1.2 (LO) to 8.0 (MAR) to 11.8 micrograms/d (HI). For LO versus MAR and LO versus HI, differences in DR were positively related to differences in the plasma ROH pool size. These results suggest that low plasma ROH concentrations are associated not only with low liver vitamin A levels, but also with a decreased ROH DR. This decreased DR may or may not reflect a compromised functioning of ROH-dependent systems.\r"

Serum zinc was consistently lower in AZn and MZn rats receiving EMB than in rats without EMB. Apparent zinc absorption, measured by 65Zn balance, was higher in AZn rats receiving EMB than in AZn rats without EMB. Thus changes in absorption could not account for lower serum zinc levels in EMB-treated rats. However, 65Zn turnover was also higher in EMB groups. This suggests that EMB may have increased urinary zinc losses resulting in reduced circulating zinc and a consequent increase in zinc absorption.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of metallothionein (MT) in the sequestration and storage of zinc in newborn rat livers, a cross-fostering experiment was performed in which zinc-deficient (Zn-D) pups were suckled from Zn-sufficient (Zn-S) dams and vice versa. At consecutive days during lactation, groups of pups were killed. The experiment was continued for 22 d. Zinc concentrations in various tissues and MT concentrations in livers and kidneys were analyzed. The retention of injected 65Zn, as well as body weight, was also studied in both groups. Higher whole-body retention of 65Zn in the zinc-depleted (Zn-Dp) rats indicates a decreased zinc turnover. These rats also showed markedly reduced growth. The observation that the zinc-repleted (Zn-Rp) pups, although showing 65Zn retention similar to that of controls, grew less than controls suggests that Zn-Rp may not compensate for gestational zinc deficiency. Zn-Rp pups showed an increased accumulation of zinc into hepatic MT until d 10, whereas Zn-Dp pups showed a more accelerated degradation of MT than controls. These data indicate that hepatic MT levels fluctuate directly in response to dietary zinc status in newborn rats. Various tissues such as spleen, heart, lung and intestine showed no difference in zinc concentration among all groups at d 22 postpartum. Thus the rapid degradation of hepatic MT in zinc deficiency that may occur to maintain the required zinc levels in other tissues supports the role of MT as a zinc storage protein in newborn rats.\r"

A purified, casein-based diet without added Se was fed to nine groups of rats throughout pregnancy to produce a marginal Se deficiency. During lactation, groups (n = 8) were fed experimental diets containing either 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 ppm Se as selenite, Se-methionine, or Se-yeast. On d 18 of lactation, tissue Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities of dams and pups were determined. Based on slope-ratio analyses, the bioavailability of Se-methionine and Se-yeast was greater than that of selenite in both lactating dams and their nursing pups. The greater availability of organic Se to pup tissues may be a direct result of the greater concentration of Se in the milk of dams fed organic Se. A dietary level of 0.25 ppm Se as Se-methionine ensured maximal GSH-Px activity in both dam and pup tissues, but 0.5 ppm Se was necessary when selenite or Se-yeast was fed. These results indicate that, regardless of form, the National Research Council recommendation for growing rats of 0.1 ppm Se is not adequate to replete lactating dams and maintain maximal tissue GSH-Px in nursing pups.\r"

To determine the effect of dietary Se deficiency on the concentration of the protein portion of GSH-Px, weanling rats were fed a Se-deficient (less than 0.02 ppm Se) or a Se-supplemented (0.2 ppm Se as Na2SeO3) 30% torula yeast-based diet and killed 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 or 28 d later. GSH-Px activity was assayed using H2O2, so only the Se-dependent GSH-Px was measured. Anti-GSH-Px antibodies, produced in a rabbit by three injections of purified rat liver GSH-Px, were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for GSH-Px protein. Immunoblotting showed that the antibodies were highly specific for GSH-Px. In Se-supplemented rats, liver GSH-Px activity increased 66% and GSH-Px protein increased 50% over the 28 d. In Se-deficient rats, liver GSH-Px activity decreased exponentially to zero with a half-life of 2.8 d. Liver GSH-Px protein also decreased exponentially, but with a longer half-life of 5.2 d (P less than 0.001), and the anti-GSH-Px antibody-reactive protein did not decrease to zero. This experiment shows that both GSH-Px activity and GSH-Px protein decrease exponentially during progressive dietary Se deficiency. The longer half-life of GSH-Px protein compared with GSH-Px activity suggests that an inactive GSH-Px polypeptide is present in rat liver during the early stages of Se deficiency.\r"

The present study was designed to examine the influence of rat strain, stage of tumor development and micronutrient composition of the diet on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced intestinal tumorigenesis. Two strains of rats [Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Fischer-344 (F-344)] were fed one of three experimental diets. The diets contained 5 or 20% dietary fat but differed in nutrient composition and nutrient-energy ratio. After receiving the experimental diets for 4 wk, animals were treated with DMH X 2HCl (10 mg/kg body wt) once a week for 20 wk and killed 10 wk after receiving the last dose of carcinogen. Long-term administration of DMH was more toxic to F-344 rats than to SD animals, and the toxicity was potentiated by reductions in the micronutrient composition of the diet. High levels of dietary fat (20%) resulted in a barely significantly higher incidence in colon tumor (but not frequency or size) in SD rats that received the diet promoting optimal growth than did low levels of dietary fat. No effect of 20% beef fat was seen in SD animals fed a diet that produced a slower growth rate or in F-344 animals.\r"

Diurnal variations in the food consumptions of these animals, maternal live weights and litter weight gains were also observed. This diurnal variation with respect to milk production and food consumption appears to be abolished by feeding a low protein (10% casein) diet. However, the variation was amplified when the amount of the control diet was restricted to 25 g/d and made available at the middark period; this was probably related to the meal-feeding behavior of these rats because they consumed all their food within 6 h after it was made available. The rates of fatty acid synthesis in the mammary glands, livers and adipose tissue measured in vivo from [3H]H2O incorporation also varied diurnally with maximal rates at the middark period. Similar rates were obtained for the rats receiving restricted amounts of the control diet measured in the feeding period, whereas the values for the rats fed the low protein diet in the dark period tended to be significantly lower. The milk fatty acids were also analyzed, and whereas no diurnal differences were detected in the samples taken from control rats, a marked reduction in the proportion of the medium-chain acids was observed in the samples from rats receiving restricted amounts of the control diet taken immediately before the normal feeding period.\r"

Tissue carnitine concentrations were determined in fetuses from cross-bred domestic gilts at stages of gestation corresponding to those of neonates found in neonatal intensive care units. Fetal piglet plasma and red blood cell carnitine levels decreased from approximately 90 d to term. Skeletal muscle carnitine increased from 60 d to term. Temporal changes in fetal carnitine concentrations in plasma, red blood cells and skeletal muscle throughout gestation are similar to the pattern reported by our laboratory for the human neonate. Cardiac muscle carnitine increased earlier than skeletal muscle but also continued to increase to term. Carnitine concentrations in fetal liver, kidney and intestine were maximal at 90 d and decreased until term. Similarities in physiology, metabolism and profiles of tissue carnitine concentration between the newborn piglet and the human neonate indicate that the neonatal piglet is an appropriate animal model for investigations concerning neonatal carnitine metabolism.\r"

At 4 wk of age, one-half of each group continued receiving the initial diet, while the other half was fed the alternate diet for two additional weeks. Growth was decreased in birds fed the low protein diet due to restriction of protein, sustained low feed intake and hence possibly insufficient energy for growth. Birds fed low protein diets had higher plasma growth hormone (GH) concentrations (325% in Leghorns and 233% in broilers) compared with controls. Plasma concentrations of somatomedin-C in protein-restricted Leghorn and broiler chicks were only 50 and 34% of those of controls, respectively. Similarly plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were reduced in protein-deprived birds compared with those fed adequate protein. Plasma T3 concentrations of restricted birds were 48 (Leghorns) and 47% (broilers) of those of controls, whereas plasma T4 concentrations were 44 (Leghorns) and 41% (broilers) of those of controls.\r"

When the acini were incubated with radioactively labeled amino acids, both cellular and milk proteins were synthesized and milk proteins were secreted into the incubation medium. Antisera to the lipogenic enzyme, fatty acid synthase, and the milk proteins, alpha-lactalbumin and the caseins, raised in rabbits, were shown to be specific by analyzing immunoprecipitates on sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gels. The rates of synthesis and secretion of each protein by acini prepared from rats during late gestation and at specific stages of lactation reflect their previously observed concentration in the mammary gland or milk of rats at the corresponding stage of gestation or lactation. Rats were treated according to one of the following regimes between d 7 and 14 of lactation: they were fed a control (20% casein) or a low protein (10% casein) diet ad libitum, they were fed the control diet restricted to 25 g/d (40% of the voluntary intake), they were fed the control diet for 5 d and starved for 48 h or they were treated as in 3 and then refed the control diet ad libitum for 24 h. Food restriction and starvation both resulted in lowered rates of synthesis of all proteins examined compared with either the control or refed animals. Starvation also lowered the rates of secretion of the milk proteins. Consumption of the low protein diet caused a specific decrease in both the rates of synthesis and secretion of alpha-lactalbumin compared with the control rats without affecting the synthesis and secretion of the caseins.\r"

  ".W": "The avian epiphyseal growth plate plays an important role in skeletal development. Compared with the mammalian species, the avian growth plate contains more cells, is less well organized and appears more susceptible to malformation. Abnormal cartilage development is associated with chondrodystrophy, tibial dyschondroplasia and rickets. Many nutrient deficiencies result in chondrodystrophy, which is characterized by shortened, thickened bones and a narrowing of the epiphyseal growth plate. Manganese, the most extensively studied of these deficiencies, is necessary for proteoglycan biosynthesis. Tibial dyschondroplasia is a condition in which the prehypertrophic cells fail to hypertrophy and vascularization is aborted. This abnormality is found in genetically predisposed animals and its occurrence is altered by subtle changes in calcium, phosphorus and electrolyte content of the diet. Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies cause rickets, which is characterized by an increase in the width of the prehypertrophic zone of the epiphyseal growth plate. Most of the biochemical and histological changes can be related to the need for calcium for chondrocyte hypertrophy and maturation, although there is some evidence that chondrocytes require specific vitamin D metabolites. Phosphorus deficiency increases the zones of hypertrophy and metaphyseal primary spongiosa.\r"

Simulation with this model indicated oscillations in the plasma calcium concentration in growing chicks under normal dietary conditions. The oscillations diminish in amplitude and finally disappear when dietary calcium concentrations are either reduced or elevated. These oscillations, triggered by the perturbation imposed by growth, are the result of the dual action of parathyroid hormone on bone on the one hand and on intestinal calcium absorption via the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol synthesizing system on the other and the difference in the response time between the two subsystems. Simulation also predicts that at high or low intakes of calcium, the capacity of the control systems is exceeded and oscillation in plasma. calcium diminish and finally disappear. Bone calcium, simulated for different calcium concentrations, mimics documented experimental results.\r"

A complex endocrine system coordinates the metabolism of vitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol[1,25(OH)2D3] and 24R,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol[24R,25)OH)2D3] and 28 other metabolites; of these 16 were originally isolated and chemically characterized from avian systems. Key advances in understanding the mode of action of the seco-steroid 1,25(OH)2D3 and the scope of its action have been made by studying the tissue distribution of both its receptor and its gene-induced product, a 28,000-dalton calcium-binding protein termed calbindin-D28K. To date no less than 23 tissues have been found to have specific 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors; of these 10 were identified in avian studies. Similarly, nine tissues express the vitamin D-induced calbindin; seven have been reported in avian tissues. The second dihydroxylated metabolite, 24R,25(OH)2D3, has been reported to be capable of inducing a variety of specific biological effects, some when the steroid is administered alone and some in the presence of its companion dihydroxylated metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3. There is emerging evidence for the existence of specific receptors for 24R,25(OH)2D3, particularly in chondrocytes and parathyroid glands (both studied in avian systems). These observations collectively demonstrate the broad scope of the vitamin D endocrine system.\r"

Within the overall scheme of chemical, hormonal and target tissue interactions, the kidneys serve as a safety valve, operating on a minute-to-minute basis to excrete Ca and Pi when these minerals are present in excess or to conserve Ca and Pi when they are needed for eggshell formation or bone mineral replenishment. This key role of the kidneys is directly mediated by PTH, acting to stimulate Ca reabsorption and increase Pi excretion at the tubular level. By dissociating Ca from Pi transport, the kidneys serve to maintain appropriate blood Ca:Pi concentration ratios during extremes of dietary challenge or bone mineral mobilization. Direct regulatory roles for vitamin D metabolites and calcitonin on avian urinary Ca and Pi excretion have yet to be firmly established.\r"

White mice were fed 2 wt% safflower oil and either 10 wt% MO or 10 wt% hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) for 23 d. The stability of dietary MO-induced fatty acid modifications was assessed by replacing the MO diet of a group of mice after 23 d with the HCO diet for an additional 10 d. Mice were sacrificed on d 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 23 and 33. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were rapidly incorporated into lung and kidney phosphoglyceride (PL) classes during the first 7 d of MO ingestion relative to the controls. After 1 wk of MO consumption, the rate of incorporation either plateaued at an elevated level or continued to increase at a much more gradual rate. A marked increase in the content of 22:5n-3 in lung and kidney was observed. A concomitant and rapid decrease was observed in the n-6 PUFA, 20:4n-6, 22:5n-6 and 18:2n-6. The minimum content of 20:4n-6 was reached between 1 and 2 wk, whereas the minimum levels of 18:2n-6 and 22:5n-6 occurred within 72 h. The n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in lung and kidney and PL classes increased in mice fed HCO and decreased in mice fed dietary MO. When dietary MO was removed, the n-3 PUFA levels decreased with a concomitant increase in n-6 PUFA after 10 d of HCO consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rats fed a low protein (9% metabolizable energy) diet and housed at 24 degrees C gained less weight and body energy then controls fed a normal (25%) protein diet. Energy intake and expenditure corrected for body size [kJ/(kg0.75 X d)] were similar in rats fed the two diets, but energetic efficiency was suppressed in low protein-fed rats, and the thermogenic response to norepinephrine and the activity of brown adipose tissue (mitochondrial GDP binding) were both significantly elevated. Housing at a higher temperature (29 degrees C) suppressed energy expenditure and brown fat activity in animals fed either diet, and gross efficiency was greater in control animals at 29 degrees C than at 24 degrees C but unaffected in the protein-deficient group. The differences in brown fat activity between dietary groups were still apparent at 29 degrees C. The results suggest that thermogenesis induced by feeding low protein diets is not markedly inhibited by a higher environmental temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Adult male rats were fed for 7 wk either a low fat diet (3% fat) or a high fat-cholesterol diet (20% fat, 0.5% cholesterol) containing 7% wheat germ or not. Body weights and food intakes were unchanged by adding wheat germ to the control low fat or high fat diets. Adding wheat germ to the high fat-cholesterol diet significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the HDL-serum cholesterol ratio and lowered the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides. Thus the lipoprotein pattern was comparable to that obtained with the low fat diet, but the VLDL lipid composition remained altered. At the same time, triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation in the liver and the triglyceride content in skin were significantly decreased. When wheat germ was added to the low fat diet, cholesterol and triglycerides were not significantly modified. No adaptative change in lipase and colipase contents was observed in the pancreas of rats fed the wheat germ-supplemented diets, whereas the high fat diet increased these values. The results show a beneficial effect of wheat germ added to a high fat-cholesterol diet on the lipid status of rats; the implicated mechanisms are yet to be elucidated.\r"

  ".U": "87225313\r", 
  ".W": "During gestation iron is diverted from maternal tissues to satisfy fetal requirements, but the factors controlling this transfer are not well understood. Riboflavin may be important in this process, because it is believed to be involved in the mobilization of iron from tissue ferritin. An experiment was designed to test this possibility. Female Norwegian Hooded rats were fed a riboflavin-deficient diet (B2-) from 10 wk of age through to mating and gestation. Control animals fed a complete diet (B2+) were weight-matched to the rats fed the B2- diet. At d 17 or 20 of gestation 59Fe was administered to the dam, and distribution of 59Fe between maternal, placental and fetal tissues was determined 24 h later. Iron-mobilizing activity in placental mitochondria preparations was reduced in riboflavin-deficient rats at d 18 of gestation. Riboflavin deficiency was associated with a reduction in the percentage of the radioiron dose reaching the fetal tissue at both stages of gestation. Maternal hepatic iron stores and plasma iron levels were greater in B2- dams than in controls at d 18 of gestation and showed a reduced rate of depletion over the subsequent 3 d. However, concentrations of radioiron and of ferritin iron and nonheme iron in the fetal tissues were unaffected by riboflavin status. The primary effect of riboflavin deficiency appeared to be a reduction in fetal mass, which served to limit maternal iron depletion and maternofetal iron transfer.\r"

  ".W": "Variations of a recently proposed rat bioassay were examined and applied to the measurement of biologically available folate. The concentration of hepatic folate was found to be inconsistent as a response indicator, although fasting levels of plasma folate accurately reflected available dietary folate. Studies involving the control of coprophagy suggested that fecal folate significantly contributes to the folate status of the rat. Bioassays employing multiple dietary levels of dried orange juice solids or blanched cabbage without control of coprophagy were conducted to determined available folate by slope-ratio methods. The apparent bioavailability of endogenous folate in the dried orange juice and cabbage was 146 and 68%, respectively, relative to folic acid. The presence of dried orange juice solids or cabbage did not inhibit the utilization of folate pentaglutamate added to the diets. These results illustrate the usefulness and several limitations of the rat bioassay for evaluating the bioavailability of folate. However, the appropriateness of the rat as a model of human folate digestion and absorption requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the distribution of vitamin A between parenchymal and stellate cells in rats with low vitamin A liver reserves is different from that observed in rats with adequate reserves. Retinol and retinyl esters were quantitated in parenchymal and stellate cells of the liver of three groups (n = 3) of adult Sprague-Dawley rats with mean total liver vitamin A reserves of 1.2, 14.5 and 28.9 micrograms retinol/g fresh liver for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The amount of vitamin A per 10(6) cells was similar in parenchymal and stellate cells of group 1, whereas in groups 2 and 3, a much higher amount was found in stellate cells (11-fold and 27-fold higher, respectively). In group 1, 83% of the liver vitamin A was present in parenchymal cells. As liver stores rose, however, a progressively greater amount was stored in stellate cells. In group 3, 82% of the liver vitamin A was found in stellate cells. In groups 2 and 3, 87-91% of the vitamin A was found as retinyl ester, whereas in group 1, 52% was found as retinol. The retinyl ester composition was similar in parenchymal and stellate cells, major esters being palmitate (84%) and stearate (10%), with smaller amounts of oleate (2.5%) and other esters. Thus, in rats with low liver vitamin A reserves, most of the liver vitamin A is found in parenchymal cells.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of mercaptans, especially the beta-mercaptocarboxylic acids, inhibited the selenium (Se)-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGSHpx) activity of chick liver postmitochondrial supernatant or cytosol and of purified bovine erythrocyte SeGSHpx. The effects of mercaptans and a glutathione analogue on Se utilization were determined by subcutaneous injection of test compounds into vitamin E-deficient chicks fed diets containing 0.1 ppm Se (as Na2SeO3) at times when greater than 50% of vitamin E- and Se-deficient chicks showed the vitamin E-, Se-deficiency disease exudative diathesis (ED). D-(-)-Penicillamine hydrochloride (the positive control model compound), sodium beta-mercaptopyruvate, t-butyl mercaptan and S-methylglutathione (nonmercaptan glutathione analogue) decreased SeGSHpx activity in chick liver postmitchondrial supernatants within 24 h of injection and increased the incidence of ED within 4 d. Other mercaptans tested did not increase ED incidence or affect liver, kidney or plasma SeGSHpx activities. Although mercaptosuccinic acid, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine and sodium thioglycolate each strongly inhibited SeGSHpx in vitro, each also significantly increased chick mortality in the dosage range tested; therefore, their effects on SeGSHpx in vivo could not be evaluated. It appears that the beta-mercaptocarboxylic acids, mercaptans with a high degree of steric hinderance in close proximity to the thiol group and a close structural analogue of glutathione are capable of altering selenium status in chicks.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports indicate that the concentrations and total amounts of several essential trace metals in various tissues of genetically obese rodents differ markedly from those in lean controls. In the present studies the absorption, retention and tissue distribution of zinc and constitutive levels of zinc-metallothionein (Zn-MT) in selected tissues were compared in obese (ob/ob) and lean (+/?) C57BL/6J mice. When 5-, 10- and 22-wk-old mice were administered 1.2 mumol 65Zn by stomach tube the apparent absorption of 65Zn by obese mice was 1.5, 2.2 and 3.9 times higher, respectively, than that in age-matched lean mice. Retention of orally administered 65Zn after 96 h was also substantially higher in obese mice than in lean mice. To assess the possible influences of hyperphagia and intestinal hypertrophy on the enhanced apparent absorption of 65Zn by obese mice food intake by an additional group of obese mice was restricted to that of age-matched lean controls. When actual absorption of zinc was determined according to the method of Heth and Hoekstra, groups of ad libitum--fed obese, pair-fed obese and lean mice absorbed 38, 32 and 18% of administered 65Zn, respectively. In contrast, the rate of 65Zn excretion 2-6 d after oral or subcutaneous administration of the metal was similar for obese and lean mice. Unrestricted and pair-fed obese mice had significantly lower percentages of carcass 65Zn present in skin, muscle plus bone, spleen and testes and higher percentages present in liver, small intestine and adipose tissue than lean mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
