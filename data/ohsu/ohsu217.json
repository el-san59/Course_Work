Microdilution tests were performed with 16,016 bacterial isolates. An isolate was considered susceptible to cefixime if the minimal inhibitory concentration was less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml and resistant if the minimal inhibitory concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml. Cefixime was effective against the Enterobacteriaceae (87.7% susceptible to 1.0 microgram/ml) as well as against pathogenic Neisseria spp. (including penicillin-resistant gonococci), Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Streptococcus species (minimal concentration inhibiting 90% of organisms less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml). Species resistant to cefixime included penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Listeria spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp.\r"

It inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.\r"

In general serum and urinary concentrations of cefixime achieved after recommended daily doses are well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations at 90% for indicated microorganisms. The pharmacokinetics of cefixime were determined in adult and pediatric subjects. In general the half-life of the drug is about 3 to 4 hours and is not dependent on dose. The drug is not extensively bound to serum proteins; the free fraction is about 31% and is concentration-independent. The absolute bioavailability, based on comparisons of area under the serum concentration-time curve values after 200-mg intravenous, 200-mg oral solution, and 200- and 400-mg capsule doses, ranged from 40 to 52%, showing a comparable bioavailability for cefixime at single 200- and 400-mg oral doses. In a dose proportionality study, over an oral dose range of 200 to 2000 mg, peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time values increased linearly but were not directly proportional with dose. Upon multiple dosing for 2 weeks on a 400-mg daily or 200-mg twice a day regimen, serum concentrations and urinary recovery of unchanged drug were similar for each group, and there was no drug accumulation. Peak serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve values after a 400-mg dose were almost double those after a 200-mg dose. All formulations of cefixime were bioequivalent to an oral reference solution at doses of 200 and 400 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cefixime was administered daily or twice daily and because results on the two dosage regimens did not differ, data were combined for analysis. Results suggested that cefixime was somewhat more effective than amoxicillin for acute otitis media with effusion caused by Haemophilus influenzae but less effective for infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The medical records of the 169 pediatric patients from whom the C-S were obtained were reviewed and divided into infected (N = 11) and uninfected (N = 158) groups. The phenotypic traits of strains associated with infection included: (1) slime production (P = 0.014); (2) slime-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis (P = 0.002); and (3) resistance to penicillin (P = 0.03), oxacillin (P less than 0.001), clindamycin (P = 0.003), chloramphenicol (P less than 0.001) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P less than 0.001). Infected patients were significantly older (P = 0.006) than uninfected patients. Simultaneous isolation of the same strain of C-S from the aerobic and anaerobic bottles of a single blood culture increased the probability of sepsis (P = 0.004). The combination of these patient and laboratory data may be useful in determining the clinical significance of C-S recovered from pediatric patients.\r"

Catheters remained in place for an average of 241 days. Possible catheter sepsis and exit site infection accounted for the majority (39 of 76) of the complications of long term central venous catheterization. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count under 500/mm3) was associated with 70% of the catheter-related infections and 75% of the non-catheter-related infections. Catheters inserted during neutropenic episodes (23) were associated with an increased risk of subsequent septicemia (60% vs. 25%), a finding apparently related to their exposure to further neutropenia (38% vs. 16% catheter days). Of the 32 episodes of septicemia of unknown origin, 19 involved Gram-negative bacteria, 14 involved Gram-positive bacteria and 4 were caused by fungi. Five of these episodes involved multiple organisms. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common Gram-positive organism isolated (7 of 14). Four episodes of septicemia resolved before therapy and are considered false positive cultures. Of the other 28 episodes of septicemia, 25 (89%) were successfully treated without catheter removal including 3 episodes of fungemia and 4 of multiple organism sepsis. These data demonstrate the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment without catheter removal in the pediatric oncology population with catheter-associated infections including those associated with neutropenia, multiple organisms and fungemia.\r"

Of the 137 patients studied 66 were HIV-positive and 71 were HIV-negative. Evidence of HBsAb (n = 44) or exposure to hepatitis vaccine (n = 12) was found in 85% of HIV positive patients at some time during their care in our clinic. However, 20% demonstrated subsequent antibody loss and/or did not respond to hepatitis vaccine. Loss of HBsAb or vaccine nonresponse was restricted to patients less than 21 years of age (72% of all patients). This result contrasted to only a 3% loss of HBsAb or vaccine nonresponse in the HIV-negative patients who had acquired the HBsAb (n = 23) or were given the hepatitis vaccine (n = 29). This result suggests that loss or alterations of hepatitis B immunity occur in association with HIV infection or exposure.\r"

This is a different pattern from that seen in the majority of earlier reports. In 60 of the 125 medical patients the aetiology of the acute renal failure could only be determined by renal biopsy. This series suggests that with changing medical practice (particularly the improvement in resuscitation) and an ageing population, the pattern of causes of acute renal failure is altering. It also highlights the value of renal histology as a guide to diagnosis and treatment in patients with unexplained acute renal failure.\r"

In common with other groups, there was a much higher incidence of asymptomatic (341 or 66.2 per cent) than symptomatic (174 or 33.8 per cent) ST segment depressions. Seventy-eight (15.1 per cent) of the ST segment depressions occurring in the absence of angina pain (and hence termed asymptomatic) were actually associated with other somatic sensations such as breathlessness and emotional upset. Reported disorders of sleep and poor energy levels were also associated with more ischaemic events. The view is presented that it is no longer adequate to obtain a classical history of angina pectoris for this poorly reflects the ischaemic myocardium. It is the functional capacity of the pump rather than the appearance of the rigid narrowings of the coronary arteries that is of importance both for the patient and the left ventricle. Further the role of mental upset occurring in daily life appears increasingly important in the aetiology of silent myocardial ischaemia. Recognition of this and appropriate counselling of the patient is important.\r"

Three patients had advanced rectal adenocarcinoma and a relatively long duration of Crohn's disease, two patients had an early adenocarcinoma and a short antecedent history, and a sixth patient had advanced cloacogenic cancer of the anorectum. The prognosis for a patient with carcinoma in association with regional enteritis was poor when there was advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The late diagnosis of the cancer may have been the result of three erroneous assumptions. First, scepticism as to the association of Crohn's disease and cancer despite the evidence to the contrary; second, misinterpretation of the intestinal symptoms of the carcinoma as those of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease; and third, confusing the clinical picture of colorectal cancer with that of benign perianal disease with stricture formation. Increased awareness of the association of cancer and Crohn's disease, particularly the development of cancer in apparently normal bowel, and careful evaluation of all new symptoms should improve the prognosis of this potentially lethal complication of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Heart disease presented with effort dyspnoea, cardiac failure, palpitation, ECG changes or cardiomegaly. Initial chest radiographs showed cardiac enlargement in seven patients. Electrocardiograms were abnormal in nine patients with repolarisation disorders or intraventricular conduction defects. Rhythm disturbances were found in six. Echocardiograms were performed on six patients; all were abnormal showing left ventricular hypertrophy or impaired function. In five patients radionuclide ventriculography was also performed. Cardiac catheterisation was undertaken on seven patients; all showed either hypertrophy or dilatation of the left ventricle. Coronary arteries were widely dilated in two patients and in another there was dilation of the proximal segment only. In six of the 10 patients, acromegaly was cured by transsphenoidal surgery. This resulted in limited improvement of cardiac function in two patients only. Of the four patients who were not cured, three died and one was lost to the study. Four patients in total died and autopsies were obtained in two: one showed changes suggesting myocarditis and the other diffuse fibrosis. It is concluded that acromegaly may infrequently lead to heart disease, and that if recognised at an early stage progression may, in a proportion of patients, be arrested by successful treatment.\r"

One hundred and six patients had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 69 'cryptogenic' chronic active hepatitis (no autoimmune markers or other aetiological factors identified), and 29 were HBsAg-seropositive. Variceal haemorrhage, encephalopathy and ascites were common presenting features in the cryptogenic group while the presence of jaundice and other immunopathic diseases did not differ between the groups. Cirrhosis was more common at presentation in the cryptogenic group. Remission was induced with corticosteroids and azathioprine in 82 per cent of patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatis and in 77 per cent of patients with cryptogenic chronic active hepatitis and the annual relapse rate was similar in the autoimmune and cryptogenic groups. Five-year survival was 87 per cent in the autoimmune group, 65 per cent in the cryptogenic group, and 80 per cent in those with HBsAg-positive disease, and on logistic regression analysis, the presence of cirrhosis at presentation was the only independent factor which adversely affected survival. Overall survival in the cirrhotic patients at five and 12 years was 63 and 48 per cent respectively compared with 95 and 92 per cent in those without cirrhosis.\r"

In one case described herein, small-colony variant forms of S. epidermidis were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from a patient with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Data from the rat model of experimental endocarditis provide further evidence that small-colony variants may be operative in the production of prosthetic valve infection. Moreover, a review of the literature indicates that small-colony variants could account for the subtle clinical course after prolonged dormant infection that characterizes S. epidermidis prosthetic valve endocarditis. It is therefore hypothesized that small-colony variants of S. epidermidis may play a role in the pathogenesis of prosthetic valve endocarditis.\r"

The roentgenologic spectrum of disease closely resembled that of M tuberculosis. One third of the patients had predisposing factors, and the disease predominated in middle-aged and elderly men. Two thirds of the patients had slow progression of the disease, with an average of 6.4 years before roentgenographic changes occurred. The diagnosis was frequently missed, and in most of the patients it was delayed from one to 16 years. Only after chronic, slow disease progression was atypical mycobacteriosis suspected clinically. The more widespread application of multiple simultaneous skin tests for atypical mycobacteria may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease.\r"

Survival in stage I is 87.5% and in stage II, 50%. Survival is 88.9% among patients with grade 1 tumors and 33.3% for those with grade 3 lesions. Morbidity related to chromic phosphate P 32 was minimal; small bowel obstruction occurred in only one patient who had also received external pelvic irradiation. Our results suggest that chromic phosphate P 32 is a safe, well tolerated, inexpensive, and effective adjuvant to surgery in the management of selected patients with ovarian malignancy.\r"

All patients were treated with combination chemotherapy regimens of comparable efficacy with or without chest radiotherapy and/or surgical resection. Median survival for the 101 patients was 16 months; the three-year actuarial survival was 14%. Elevated serum LDH level at the time of diagnosis was predictive of improved survival by both univariate and multivariate analyses (P less than .01). Initial tumor volume (calculated from tumor measurements) on chest roentgenogram and clinical TNM stage were unrelated to survival. Until the prognostic significance of an elevated serum LDH level is confirmed by other investigators, we cannot recommend any modification in the current system for staging small cell lung cancer. Although patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer form a clinically heterogeneous group, they should continue to be treated uniformly.\r"

  ".W": "A notion has prevailed that carinal bronchogenic cyst and other congenital mediastinal cystic lesions, particularly those occurring in older children and adults, are usually asymptomatic, innocuous, and frequently only an incidental finding on routine chest roentgenogram or postmortem examination. Some physicians, therefore, have adopted a policy of observation for these patients. Our experience, however, as demonstrated in three cases reported herein, and the experience of others, clearly shows that carinal bronchogenic cyst is far from being usually asymptomatic and innocuous, but in fact often produces a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, some of which are life-threatening. Mere observation not only places these patients at serious risk, but also increases the possibility of missed diagnosis and delayed treatment of those lymphoproliferative malignancies involving mediastinal lymph nodes that can mimic a carinal bronchogenic cyst. Computerized tomography (CT) is the single most important method of making a diagnosis of carinal bronchogenic cyst. We believe strongly that the mere presence of a mediastinal carinal bronchogenic cyst is an indication for surgical excision.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical presentations of liver abscess, hepatoma, and metastatic tumor to the liver may be quite similar, and procedures such as computerized tomography, radionuclide scanning, and ultrasonography of the liver cannot make a specific diagnosis. Therefore, we compared the clinical presentations of 38 patients seen during the last five years with liver abscess (13 patients), hepatoma (eight patients), and undifferentiated carcinoma metastatic to the liver (17 patients). Patients with liver abscess were distinguished from the other two groups by a significantly shorter prodrome, a history of known risk factors for liver abscess, fever, leukocytosis, and a normal-sized liver (P values all less than .1). A finding of three or more of these criteria correctly identified all cases of liver abscess. Only one of the 25 patients with neoplasms had three of the criteria. The presence of multiple or single lesions, abdominal pain, weight loss, or liver function abnormalities did not differ significantly among the three groups. Thus patients with liver abscess can be reliably differentiated from patients with hepatic neoplasms by clinical criteria alone, and appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy can be started while the diagnosis is being confirmed.\r"

Toxicity can occur acutely, as with accidental overdose, or with long-term maintenance dosing. In children it is almost always acute. Conventional treatment includes gastric lavage or ipecac-induced emesis, and activated charcoal or nonabsorbable resins and cathartics to reduce absorption. Although children appear to tolerate massive ingestions without specific therapy, serum digoxin levels must be reduced quickly and safely when conventional measures have failed. Fab fragments of digoxin-specific antibodies have been successfully used to treat refractory digoxin toxicity. Indications for use should be limited to life-threatening digoxin toxicity when conventional therapy has failed.\r"

One patient had severe impairment of both renal and liver function. In the 20 remaining subjects vasoactive intestinal polypeptide concentrations were normal, and only two patients had increased concentrations of somatostatin. Increases in pancreatic polypeptide were detected more commonly (7/20), but these may have been non-specific age related increases. The major finding was high concentrations of motilin (greater than 496 pg/ml) in 17 of 20 patients. Plasma motilin was subsequently assayed in 16 more patients with lung cancer, including 10 patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. At concentrations over 900 pg/ml plasma motilin appears to be a tumour marker for small cell carcinoma of the lung with acceptable sensitivity (59%) and specificity (78%). The origin of increased plasma motilin in small cell carcinoma of the lung was investigated. Bombesin (gastrin releasing peptide), a peptide known to stimulate the release of motilin in man, was, as in previous studies, detected in tumour but not in plasma, except in one patient out of 21. Immunohistochemical studies failed to detect motilin antigen in biopsy samples. Motilin tumour content was found to be low in tumour tissue from three patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung who had appreciable hypermotilinaemia and from three patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung who had either normal or slightly raised plasma motilin concentrations. The stimulus to motilin secretion in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung remains unclear.\r"

The Cobb angle of those with kyphoscoliosis varied from 60 degrees to 140 degrees (median 100 degrees) and the vital capacity varied from 17% to 56% (median 28%) of the value predicted on the basis of span. Recordings made during sleep included expired carbon dioxide tension at the nose, gas flow at the mouth, arterial oxygen saturation, chest wall movement, and the electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, and electrocardiogram. In three subjects transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension was measured simultaneously. Patients with kyphoscoliosis hypoventilated during sleep, particularly in rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in a rise in end tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension, and a reduction in oxygen saturation to a degree not observed in normal subjects. Reduced chest wall movement was the major cause of these episodes, which were more frequent and occupied a greater proportion of sleep time in those with kyphoscoliosis than in normal subjects. Serious cardiac arrhythmias were rarely associated. It is concluded that disturbances of respiration during sleep occur in patients with kyphoscoliosis and that these may be important in the pathogenesis of cardiorespiratory failure.\r"

In the present study the potential difference from the floor of the nose has therefore been assessed in normal subjects, as well as in adult patients with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and Young's syndrome. Voltages existing along the floor of the nasal cavity were recorded. The mean potential difference was similar in controls (-18 (SD 5) mv) and in patients with bronchiectasis (-17 (6) mv) and Young's syndrome (-20 (6) mv). The potential difference in cystic fibrosis (-45 (8) mv) was significantly different from controls (p less than 0.002) and there was no overlap between the cystic fibrosis values and values obtained in normal and diseased controls. This simple technique therefore discriminates well between patients with cystic fibrosis and other populations, raising the possibility of its use to assist in diagnosis.\r"

Most strains were resistant to the individual drugs, but all strains of M malmoense, 86% of M xenopi, and 31% of M avium intracellulare were completely suppressed by the lowest concentrations of ethambutol and rifampicin when the two drugs were combined in vitro. Streptomycin combined with ethambutol or with rifampicin in the lowest combined concentrations suppressed 50% and 62% respectively of strains of M malmoense. All strains of M xenopi were suppressed by the lowest combined concentrations of streptomycin with rifampicin. Combinations with isoniazid were less effective. It is postulated that similar effects in vivo might account for the satisfactory clinical response seen in patients with disease caused by these mycobacteria who have received treatment with combinations of standard antituberculosis drugs despite in vitro resistance to the individual agents.\r"

Quantitative histological studies of the airway wall showed no difference in gland size, smooth muscle, connective tissue, or Reid index between the groups. The central airways of patients with mucus hypersecretion showed increased mucosal inflammation. The five ex-smokers in whom mucus hypersecretion persisted after they had stopped smoking had both central and peripheral airways affected by the inflammatory response, and these patients also had an abnormal result in the nitrogen washout test.\r"

The five commonest signs of bronchial carcinoma were a mass, coarse linear shadows contiguous to a mass, unilateral hilar enlargement, linear shadows from mass to periphery, and an irregular margin to a mass. The combination of either two or three of these signs was highly sensitive, 95% and 89% respectively, in detecting carcinoma. The most useful specific signs were lobulation of the mass and cavitation with thick or irregular walls.\r"

One patient died within 24 hours of the biopsy procedure owing to asphyxia resulting from aspiration of the contents of an acutely dilated stomach. Our experience clearly establishes that the drill biopsy as used by us is simple and safe and can be carried out in an outpatient department, yielding better overall results than any other procedure for closed biopsy of the lung currently practised.\r"

The proportion of type III collagen in the whole organ as well as in the pepsin solubilised fraction was slightly but significantly raised (net increase of about 5-10% type III collagen (p less than 0.05]. Both type I and type III collagen from the patients contained less hydroxylysine than collagen from control lungs. The alterations in tissue composition described here and observed in normal wound healing support the notion that acute post-traumatic pulmonary fibrosis resembles a wound healing process in the lungs.\r"

On two separate days the subject performed isocapnic hyperpnoea with dry air at 60-70 l min-1 for five minutes. Before, immediately after, and five minutes after completion of a test sRaw measurements were made. Heat and moisture exchangers were placed in the breathing circuit on one of the two days. All subjects had an increase in sRaw of 100% or more without the heat and moisture exchangers (average increase 300%) but were protected from bronchoconstriction with the devices in place (average increase 7%) (p less than 0.005). The exchanger's resistance to airflow was less than 1 cm H2O for flow rates of 100 l min-1. A heat and moisture exchanger designed as a facemask or mouthpiece may allow a person with asthma to exercise without the need for prophylactic drugs.\r"

The time taken for the phrenic nerves to be located and adequately stimulated was measured in 110 subjects, aged 21-89 years, 26 of whom had diaphragmatic weakness; and phrenic nerve conduction time was recorded in 76 of these individuals. Each phrenic nerve was stimulated transcutaneously in the neck with square wave impulses 0.1 ms in duration at 1 Hz and 80-160 volts while diaphragmatic muscle action potentials were recorded with surface electrodes. The time taken to locate either phrenic nerve ranged from two seconds to 22 minutes (median 10s). Both nerves were located in 83 of the 84 control subjects (99%) and in 21 of the 26 patients with diaphragmatic weakness (81%). Mean (SD) phrenic nerve conduction time in the control subjects was 6.94 (0.77) ms on the right and 6.61 (0.77) ms on the left. A weak relationship was found between conduction time and the subjects' age and height. Four out of 24 patients with diaphragmatic weakness had a prolonged phrenic nerve conduction time. Transcutaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerves was not a time consuming procedure, and it was well tolerated, reproducible, and successful in 95% of subjects.\r"

The response time of the oximeter was measured after a sudden rise in inspired oxygen concentration. Artefact rejection was assessed by arterial compression proximal to the probe site, and by simultaneous recordings of overnight Sao2 on opposite hands. The ability to recreate patterns of oscillating Sao2 from the data stored in the oximeter was also investigated. With the best probe system the oximeter measured Sao2, relative to arterial values estimated from Pao2, with a mean (SD) difference of -0.4% (1.8%). The response time was comparable with those of previous oximeters. It was not possible to generate artefactual dips in excess of 2% Sao2, and the dual overnight recordings rarely showed even small dips on one tracing alone. The stored data can recreate oscillating Sao2 signals with wavelengths down to about 35 seconds, but not below. The Ohmeda 3700 pulse oximeter appears to be suitable for unattended overnight recordings of Sao2.\r"

An indicator of alcohol abuse--registration with the social authorities for alcoholic problems--was used to evaluate the role of alcohol in relation to general and cause-specific mortality in a general population sample. Altogether 1,116 men (11%) out of a total population of 10,004 men were registered for alcoholic problems. Total mortality during 11.8 years' follow-up was 10.4% among the non-registered men, compared to 20.5% among men with occasional convictions for drunkenness and 29.6% among heavy abusers. Fatal cancer as a whole was not independently associated with alcohol abuse, but oropharyngeal and oesophageal cancers together were seven times more common in the alcohol-registered groups. Total coronary heart disease (CHD) was significantly and independently associated with alcohol abuse, but nearly all the excess CHD mortality among the alcohol-registered men could be attributed to sudden coronary death. Cases with definite recent myocardial infarction were not more common in the alcoholic population. A combined effect of coronary arteriosclerosis and heart muscle damage secondary to alcohol abuse is suggested. Other causes of death strongly associated with registration for alcohol abuse include pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and peptic ulcer, as well as death from liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. Of the excess mortality among alcohol-registered subjects, 20.1% could be attributed to CHD, 18.1% to violent death, 13.6% to alcoholism without another diagnosis and 11.1% to liver cirrhosis.\r"

Coffee drinking was negatively related to the use of low-fat milk, use of table fat high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, use of fruits and vegetables, and positively associated with bread consumption. Three persons out of four with high coffee consumption (greater than 8 cups/day) were daily smokers, in contrast to about a quarter of those with low coffee consumption (less than 1 cup/day). In women and young men, high coffee consumption was associated with low physical activity at leisure. The results suggest that high coffee consumption may be an indicator of a life style with high risk for coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and levels of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) were measured in a random sample of 4,059 women aged 25-64 years, residing in four areas of Finland. LTPA indexed as the product of weekly exercise sessions X their usual intensity showed an inverse association with smoking (p = 0.02) and with CHD risk estimate which combines the three main risk factors, smoking, serum cholesterol and blood pressure (p = 0.06), and a positive association with HDL cholesterol (p = 0.002). It was not associated with mean arterial pressure and serum total cholesterol. In a multiple regression analysis LTPA contributed independently, though modestly, to the model for CHD risk estimate. Age and body mass index were the most important independent predictors of both mean arterial pressure and CHD risk estimate. It is concluded that in middle-aged Finnish women, unlike men of the same population, high LTPA is only weakly related to lower CHD risk factor levels.\r"

The daily consumption of fish in the coastal and inland areas was 132.4 g and 55.1 g respectively, and the intake of eicosapentaenoic acid was 0.9 g and 0.25 g. The content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in platelet phospholipids and primary bleeding time were similar in the two groups. Linoleic acid was lower and saturated fatty acids were higher in phospholipids in men from the coastal area. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was increased and serum triglyceride concentration was higher in men from the coastal area. CHD mortality during a 10-year period was higher in the coastal area for both sexes. This may be associated with differences in serum triglyceride levels and platelet fatty acid composition. This study indicates that a high consumption of lean fish is not sufficient to induce changes in blood lipids and platelet function associated with low CHD mortality and it does not seem to prevent high CHD mortality.\r"

One patient had an elevated total S-CK activity three months after radiotherapy, but none of the patients had an elevated S-CK-B activity during follow-up. Three patients had elevated serum LD before irradiation, two patients during and two patients after radiotherapy, but only one patient had an elevated S-LD-1 activity, which decreased during irradiation. We conclude that the heart muscle is not injured by cardiac irradiation to such an extent that CK, CK-B, LD and LD-1 activities rise in serum, if moderate doses (39-62 Gy, NSD 1,137-1,775 rets) are delivered to the heart.\r"

The gamma-GT activity was elevated in 11 patients and its mean value was five-fold higher than in healthy controls. The increase in gamma-GT could not be explained by factors generally known to result in a misleading elevation of gamma-GT. Most patients with elevated gamma-GT also had one or more other pathological laboratory tests related to hepatic function but none had a clinically significant liver disease. Serum gamma-GT activity was not related to the disability caused by dystrophy or to the level of serum creatine kinase suggesting that the elevation of serum gamma-GT is not an indication of a general cell membrane dysfunction. It is concluded that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity in patients with myotonic dystrophy is due to a real but mild liver involvement, which should be taken into account in the examination of these patients who often complain of gastrointestinal symptoms.\r"

In this study, ambulatory ST segment monitoring was performed in 60 patients with a history of chronic stable angina pectoris, positive exercise test and/or positive coronary angiography, and a correlation was made between the episodes of chest pain and ST segment change. The patients were grouped according to the results of exercise testing and coronary arteriography, and one group was studied with and without antianginal medication. Overall, 195 episodes of angina were noted, only 94 of which (48%) were accompanied by ST segment depression. Pain and ST segment changes were best correlated in patients with a positive exercise test, positive angiography and who were not receiving antianginal medication. In 101 episodes of chest pain, ST segment change could not be identified; in 18 (18%) there was sinus tachycardia, in 12 (12%) ventricular premature beats, and in 71 (70%) sinus rhythm solely. Thus, anginal pain appears not to be the reliable indicator of transient myocardial ischaemia as was previously thought, a finding which supports the use of objective methods in identifying episodes of transient myocardial ischaemia in daily life.\r"

None of the recognized risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking and blood glucose imbalance, could be related to CHD. However, all female patients with CHD were lacking a family history of diabetes, while seven of nine female diabetic subjects without a history of CHD had diabetes in the family (p less than 0.02). This was confirmed in a second study of 150 type II diabetic subjects; CHD was more common among female patients without compared to those with diabetes in the family; 9/38 and 1/28, respectively (p less than 0.03). Diabetes increases the risk of CHD, and it does so for women more than it does for men. The finding of a possible low CHD risk in female diabetic subjects with diabetes in the family supports the hypothesis of genetic factors being important for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus.\r"

One group received individual dietary instructions by a nurse and the other a short, written leaflet given by a doctor. The principal aim of the dietary instructions was weight reduction. A significant weight loss and improvement in the control of diabetes occurred in both groups, and these changes were similar in the two groups. At the end of one year's follow-up, however, only 25% of the patients were satisfactorily controlled (fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6.0 mmol/l). The degree of weight loss correlated only weakly with the improvement in the metabolic control. The degree of obesity and insulin secretion capacity as measured at the beginning of the study did not predict the improvement of glycaemic control during the study. At the end of the study a significant improvement was observed in serum lipids of patients with good control (fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6.0 mmol/l) or weight loss (greater than 5 kg). In conclusion, both brief, written and individual dietary instructions induced a significant weight loss as well as improved glucose and lipid metabolism in newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, but satisfactory metabolic control was achieved only in a minority of the patients.\r"

Microalbuminuric patients were significantly younger at onset of diabetes but did not differ from normoalbuminuric patients concerning age or duration of diabetes. Nonetheless, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures were significantly higher in the microalbuminuric group. The existing glycemic control, assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was better in normoalbuminurics, but not significantly so. The albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric patients correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) to diastolic (r = 0.69) and to mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.69), but did not correlate to HbA1c. Thus, it is concluded that even normotensive patients with signs of early diabetic nephropathy, i.e. microalbuminuria, exhibit small, but significant increases in blood pressure.\r"

The free cholesterol of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) is considered to be the preferred substrate for LCAT. It therefore appeared as a paradox that plasma cholesterol esterification, both in vivo and in vitro, is normal in fish eye disease and Tangier disease, two familial conditions with extremely low plasma HDL levels. Fish eye disease plasma, however, was shown to have LCAT activity primarily acting on combined very low (VLDL) and low (LDL) density lipoproteins, denominated beta-LCAT, while it lacked LCAT activity esterifying HDL cholesterol (alpha-LCAT). Here we show that Tangier plasma, in contrast, has both alpha- and beta-LCAT. Thus, in both fish eye and Tangier diseases it is beta-LCAT that explains the apparent normal plasma cholesterol esterification. We also show that Tangier plasma, having alpha-LCAT activity, normalizes the low cholesteryl ester content as well as the abnormally small size of fish eye disease HDL particles during incubation.\r"

We measured plasma catecholamines before and after submaximal exercise in 26 MEN-2 gene carriers, eight of whom with asymptomatic pheochromocytoma, nine with medullary thyroid carcinoma and 10 after uni- or bilateral adrenalectomy. Seventeen clinically healthy individuals and 11 patients with neurovegetative lability and symptoms mimicking pheochromocytoma served as controls. Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine increased after exercise except for adrenaline after bilateral adrenalectomy. The post-exercise levels of adrenaline and the adrenaline/dopamine ratio were significantly higher in the pheochromocytoma patients compared to the healthy controls and the patients with neurovegetative lability, while the patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma represented an intermediate group with a high probability of developing adrenal tumors. The present method is a physiological test with a high sensitivity and specificity. It is practical and well suited for repeated examinations and seems to be of value for the detection of early pheochromocytoma in MEN-2 patients. Furthermore, the test could be used in the differential diagnosis between pheochromocytoma and neurovegetative lability.\r"

Death was attributed to causes other than the brain lesion in 59% of the patients with ischemic and in 24% of the patients with hemorrhagic stroke (p less than 0.01). Age and sex had little influence on the distribution of causes of death. Fatal pulmonary embolism and bronchopneumonia surprisingly often occurred in ambulatory patients. An intracardiac thrombus was present in 20% of deceased patients with atrial fibrillation, and in 17% of cases with a history of myocardial infarction.

  ".U": "88102800\r", 
  ".W": "The prevalence of snoring, overweight and systemic hypertension was estimated in a random sample of 4,064 Swedish men, aged 30-69 years. Of the responders, 15.5% complained of habitual snoring and 29.6% of occasional snoring. Although there was an age-related increase in the prevalence of snoring up to 60 years, habitual snoring was found to be mainly related to body mass index (BMI) (p less than 0.0001) but not to age. Altogether 299 men (9.3%) reported hypertension, 21.5% of whom were habitual snorers, compared with 14.9% of the non-hypertensives (p less than 0.01). The hypertensives were also more often overweight. Logistic multiple regression analyses showed that among subjects 40-49 years old there was an average increase in the predicted prevalence of hypertension from 6.5% among non-snorers to 10.5% of habitual snorers in the same weight group. For the whole study population, however, the increase was mainly dependent on age and BMI. Thus, the importance of habitual snoring for the prevalence of hypertension differs in various age groups.\r"

This phenomenon could either be due to the disease process with structural changes of the heart or to an abnormal hormone level. The purpose of the present paper was to study the prevalence of bradyarrhythmias in hypothyroid patients on long-term substitution therapy. Nineteen subjects were studied 9-53 months after they had reached the final thyroxine substitution level. Ambulatory ECG registrations were performed during 48 hours. Ventricular ectopic beats were observed in 10 of the 19 patients, but no bradyarrhythmias were detected. The results support the notion that arrhythmias found in hypothyroid patients are at least mainly due to the low thyroid hormone level.\r"

The diabetics had a higher mortality rate (relative death rate of 1.44 vs. 0.93, p less than 0.01) and a higher frequency of reinfarctions (18.9 vs. 10.8%, p = 0.04) than the non-diabetic population. A larger proportion of the diabetics had suffered a previous infarction, but the excess mortality was also present in those without a previous infarction. Established risk factors for death after myocardial infarction, such as age, infarct size, infarct localization and heart size, could not account for the difference in mortality. It is suggested that the increased mortality among the diabetics may be due to an increase in the rate of progression of the atherosclerotic heart disease.\r"

The two groups had similar age, sex, diabetes duration and glucose control. Blood pressure, total cholesterol, fibrinogen and in vivo platelet adhesion were all significantly elevated in patients with proteinuria (p less than 0.01), whereas these parameters were normal in the uncomplicated diabetic patients, independent of diabetes duration. The mortality of cardiovascular disease during 20 years' follow-up was significantly higher among patients with proteinuria compared with patients without proteinuria (p less than 0.001), indicating that these risk factors contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with clinical nephropathy.\r"

Out of the 49 patients, 17 (35%) had evidence of platelet clumping which, however, occurred in an unpredictable manner from time to time. Platelet clumping thus provides a confounding factor when automated platelet counts are used to monitor effects of cytotoxic treatment in this type of disorders. In a prospective study, it was shown that the problem can be overcome by optimizing the hospital routine to secure minimum delay between sampling and analysis.\r"

Panic patients had a significantly higher heart rate at 4 and 6 METS than either control group. The max METS were 11.2 +/- 2.3, 13.5 +/- 2.3 and 11.2 +/- 1.8 for the panic attack patients and control groups 1 and 2, respectively. One panic patient had ischemia on the treadmill at 12 METS. Panic patients had a significantly higher standing heart rate than controls. Furthermore, 11 of 39 panic patients had tachycardia on standing compared with 3 of 40 controls. Panic attack patients had higher wake and sleep heart rates than control group 1, but the differences were not significant. These results are consistent with autonomic dysfunction in panic patients but may also be due to differences in physical conditioning. The treadmill can be useful for reassuring patients and for identifying the rare patient with ischemia on exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The prevention of ischemic heart disease requires intervention on the natural history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Because a variety of so-called risk factors influence that natural history, it is logical to consider modification of these risk factors as a way to prevent CAD. Although this approach is effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of CAD, this presentation will focus on behavioral intervention on multiple risk factors in the secondary prevention of CAD (i.e., after the initial cardiac event). A number of studies have suggested that lifestyle modification plays an important role in preventing CAD recurrence or death. Risk factors that require this modification of human behavior include: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cigarette smoking, obesity, hypertension, physical activity and, although controversial, coronary prone personality. The assessment of these multiple factors can be performed in most acute care settings. The intervention on the factors requires a structured approach to the patient, taking advantage of the heightened awareness and concern at the time of a cardiac event. Often, several behaviors require modification simultaneously and other disciplines (behavioral medicine, nutrition, exercise physiology) are often useful when integrated into a single treatment plan. Involvement of the patient's social support network is essential. The effectiveness of the modification of each risk factor is assessed, as a means of recognizing behavior change as a way to prevent recurrence of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Sudden cardiac death is the leading mode of death in adults in the United States. While it appears intimately associated with coronary artery disease, the factors that render some subjects vulnerable to sudden cardiac death, while others with the same coronary disease do not die suddenly, are unknown. An approach is described which considers that sudden cardiac death represents a separate syndrome of coronary artery disease within certain vulnerable subjects. It is suggested that the response to psychosocial stress in vulnerable subjects results in deleterious cerebral cortical influences on the autonomic control of the heart which render it more vulnerable to ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation. Studies in the pig, an animal known to be susceptible to sudden death resulting from an environmental stress, demonstrate that cerebral cortical influences on autonomic centers play a central role in vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation after coronary artery occlusion. In this model, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation can be reduced by psychologic adaptation of the animal to his environment, cryoblockade of frontal cortical brain stem pathways and by central administration of propranolol. The relative role of adrenergic and cholinergic innervation of the heart is an important consideration.\r"

The authors evaluated longitudinal observations of survival made in 846 patients over a 12-year period. Each patient was initially studied with Mantoux-type recall antigen skin tests. The patients were categorized with respect to the following: high (greater than 5 mm) or low (less than or equal to 5 mm) averaged skin test reaction diameters at 48 hr; Clark level; tumor stage (I = localized tumor, II = local extension and/or region lymph node metastasis, III = systemic metastasis); ulceration; site of primary; histologic type; age; and sex. The percentage of high reactors in Stages I, II, and III were 44.3%, 37.4%, and 25%, respectively. Survival was evaluated with the Cox-Mantell hazard function model and the Cox regression model. The significant (chi-squared; probability) risk factors detected were tumor stage (94.58; less than or equal to 0.0001), Clark level (19.37; less than or equal to 0.0001), sex (16.97; less than or equal to 0.0001), and skin test reactivity (7.48; less than or equal to 0.0062). A significant relationship also was detected between skin test reactor status and the tumor stage (p less than or equal to 0.0330). When evaluated within each stage of disease, skin test reactivity predicted survival only in Stage II patients (p less than or equal to 0.0080). Five-year survival estimates among Stage II patients were 58% among high reactors and 38% among low reactors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cyclophosphamide prevented tumor appearance when tumor burden was low and decreased tumor growth rate in larger tumor volumes, but was unable to eradicate established tumors. Glucan did not reduce tumor incidence but decreased animal mortality. These experimental observations may correlate well with clinical evidence and suggest future clinical use of these agents.\r"

A retrospective case study and an extensive literature review were undertaken to critically evaluate this policy. Fifty-nine consecutive patients with major hemoptysis, 26 of whom had massive hemoptysis, were identified from 887 patients seen in our institution over a 10-year period. Only four of these 59 patients underwent surgery, while 55 were managed conservatively. Etiologic factors, operability, and bleeding rate all appeared to play a major role in outcome. No patients with bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, or who were on anticoagulation therapy died compared to a mortality rate of 59% in patients with carcinoma (CA) of the lung and 71% in patients with leukemia. Eleven percent of operable patients treated conservatively died compared to a 46% mortality rate for nonoperable patients. And, 9% of patients with bleeding rates less than 1,000 ml/24 hr died compared to 58% of those with greater than or equal to 1,000 ml/24 hr. Conservative management appears to have a low mortality in patients with non-tuberculosis-related major hemoptysis as well as in many patients with massive hemoptysis, especially those patients who are operable and those without neoplastic disease.\r"

In normal rats, arterial blood ketone body ratio and energy charge level at 6 hours after hemodilution decreased when the hematocrit value was less than 15%. In contrast, the values decreased at an even higher hematocrit level in cirrhotic rats. It was suggested from these results that the hemodilution procedure exerts a more profound hypoxic effect at a milder hemodilution on a cirrhotic liver than on a normal liver.\r"

There were transient increases in pulmonary artery and systemic blood pressure with decreases in cardiac output. Lymph flow increased five-fold and remained elevated for 24 hr, returning to normal by 48 hr. All animals survived.

Serotonin may have similar effects in humans and, thus may be a mediator of certain ischemic syndromes. However, the role of serotonin in human ischemic heart disease has not been studied. Since evaluation of transcardiac serotonin metabolism requires that blood samples be obtained through long catheters, it is possible that artifactual changes in serotonin concentration could occur because of platelet activation in the catheters themselves. Accordingly, to determine if serotonin could be measured through long catheters without artifactual changes, the authors obtained paired blood samples by gentle aspiration through a large bore steel needle and a 100-cm polyurethane catheter placed in the femoral vein of 13 patients. All samples were processed to obtain platelet-poor plasma and then analyzed by a sensitive radioenzymatic assay. Blood sampling through long catheters did not cause a systematic alteration in plasma serotonin concentration. Mean serotonin concentration from the femoral vein through a needle was 22.3 +/- 26.55 ng/ml (mean +/- standard deviation), and that obtained through a long catheter was 20.0 +/- 26.29 ng/ml (p = 0.34). The authors conclude that carefully obtaining blood samples through long catheters does not significantly alter the plasma serotonin concentration and thus the accurate measurement of transcardiac serotonin concentrations is possible using these methods.\r"

Her red blood cells (RBCs) had increased incubated Heinz body formation, decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), and decreased GSH stability. The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the dapsone-exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs. Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking dapsone had increased incubated Heinz body formation, the GSH content and GSH stability were normal. The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the non-dapsone-exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs. Thus, AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo, since dapsone does not cause hemolytic anemia at this dose in hematologically normal individuals. Given the influx of Southeast Asians into the United States, oxidant medications should be used with caution, especially if an infection is present, in individuals of ethnic backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin E.\r"

It has certain biologic activities similar to those of the antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid (ANRL) derived from the renal papilla and its renomedullary interstitial cells (RIC). These include a vaso-depressor effect following bolus injection and a requirement for hepatic activation for the development of biological activity. In view of this similarity to ANRL, it appeared worthwhile to test the antihypertensive action of SA when given via the GI tract. Accordingly, pure SA was given either by gavage or by tube into the stomach or duodenum of one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats (5-10 mg per dose). The role of hepatic activation was demonstrated by comparing the BP response to bolus injection of SA and ANRL with and without the presence of an intact circulation to the liver. Administration of SA via the GI tract resulted in a significant decline in BP without tachycardia or weight loss. In the absence of a circulation to the liver, neither SA nor ANRL was active. SA appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent when given via the GI tract.\r"

To determine why there have been no nonmenstrual cases of TSS reported in children in Utah, the authors tested S. aureus isolated from children for TSST-1 by radial immunodiffusion and sera from other hospitalized children by radioimmunoassay for antibody to TSST-1. TSST-1 was produced by 25% of S. aureus. Fifty-two children had infections with toxin producing strains. None had TSS. The prevalence of presumably protective levels of antibody (greater than or equal to 1:100) was high in newborns (80%), declined until age 2 years and then gradually increased with age. Therefore, there may have been about 20 children with toxigenic infection who lacked protective antibody but did not show the usual features of TSS. We conclude that the rarity of TSS in children is not caused by misdiagnosis, underreporting, or the absence of toxigenic strains or susceptible patients. Additional factors, such as local conditions or duration of carriage, may influence the clinical presentation of infection with TSST-1 producing staphylococci.\r"

Elevations in iPTH were observed in 70% to 95% of 1 degree HPT and 13% to 46% of HCM cases. There was a good correlation among the assays in the 1 degree HPT group. A significant correlation was found only between the C-terminal and N-terminal assays from the same laboratory in the HCM group. Only one (5%) of 20 1 degree HPT patients had normal iPTH in all assays while only one (4%) of 25 HCM patients had elevated iPTH in all assays. This study shows that currently available assays for iPTH can detect elevations in most patients with 1 degree HPT and can discriminate them from HCM. When renal function is impaired an N-terminal assay can still discriminate.\r"

The reduced serum potassium levels, reflecting hyperaldosteronism, increased after surgical treatment (p less than 0.003). The 28 patients were classified in three groups according to previous therapy: group I (14 patients) had been treated with a centrally active adrenergic agonist or a beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; group II (7 patients) had been treated with a diuretic, and group III (7 patients) had never received antihypertensive therapy. Serum uric acid concentrations were similar in each of the three groups and decreased significantly in each group after correction of the renal artery stenosis. These data strengthen our previous observations and further suggest that serum uric acid concentration may be useful as an index of renal vascular involvement in hypertension.\r"

Of these 54, two patients developed definite digoxin toxicity, although neither suffered significant morbidity. Digoxin administration was reduced or discontinued in all patients but one in group 1. There were no significant differences between the patients who had no signs or symptoms of digoxin toxicity (group 1) and those who did have signs or symptoms (group 2) in the mean SDC (3.9 +/- 0.1 vs 4.2 +/- 0.2 ng/mL, respectively), the serum creatinine (2.9 +/- 0.2 vs 3.4 +/- 0.4 mg/dL), or the incidence of atrial fibrillation (29/54 vs. 35/69) and coronary artery disease (21/54 vs. 18/69).

The lack of specificity was further confirmed by demonstration that this component could be dissociated by pronase but not by acid. The high affinity component was responsible for most or all of the iron uptake by the cell. However, in certain cell densities of the culture, some iron could be taken up via other mechanisms.

In all instances, the placenta had significantly higher progesterone concentrations than the chorion or amnion. Progesterone concentrations in the chorion were significantly lower after the onset of labor than before. The placenta and chorion but not the amnion converted pregnenolone to progesterone; the placenta had a significantly greater conversion rate than the chorion in all instances. Placental conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone increased significantly after labor to reach a maximum with vaginal delivery. Chorionic conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone was significantly increased after vaginal delivery but was similar after cesarean section with or without labor. The reduced tissue progesterone in the chorion, together with enhanced placental and chorionic production of progesterone from its precursor, pregnenolone, suggest that rapid metabolism and increased binding of progesterone locally in the placenta and membranes may lead to the local withdrawal or decline of progesterone and onset of labor.\r"

The liver may account for as much as two thirds of the removal of low-density lipoprotein and one third of the clearance of high-density lipoprotein in certain animal species and humans, mainly by receptor-mediated pathways. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if human fetal hepatocytes maintained in vitro take up and degrade lipoproteins. We first determined that the maximal binding capacity of iodine 125-iodo-LDL was approximately 300 ng of low-density lipoprotein protein/mg of membrane protein and an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 60 micrograms low-density lipoprotein protein/ml in membranes prepared from human fetal liver. We found that the maximal uptake of [125I]iodo-LDL and [125I]iodo-HDL by fetal hepatocytes occurred after 12 hours of incubation. Low-density lipoprotein uptake preceded the appearance of degradation products by 4 hours, and thereafter the degradation of low-density lipoprotein increased linearly for at least 24 hours. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein was not degraded to any extent by fetal hepatocytes. [125I]Iodo-LDL uptake and degradation were inhibited more than 75% by preincubation with low-density lipoprotein but not significantly by high-density lipoprotein, whereas [125I]iodo-HDL uptake was inhibited 70% by preincubation with high-density lipoprotein but not by low-density lipoprotein. In summary, human fetal hepatocytes take up and degrade low-density lipoprotein by a receptor-mediated process similar to that described for human extrahepatic tissues.\r"

The plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are threefold greater than those of normal fetuses. We have provided evidence that elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were caused by reduced uptake and metabolism of low-density lipoprotein by atrophic adrenal glands deficient in low-density lipoprotein receptors. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if other tissues, namely, skin fibroblasts, of the fetus with anencephaly were also deficient in low-density lipoprotein receptors. We compared the binding and metabolism of low-density lipoprotein by skin fibroblasts of fetuses with anencephaly and normal subjects. Cultures of skin fibroblasts were grown to confluency. Thereafter, the medium was changed to lipoprotein-deficient serum for 24 hours. The rate of uptake and degradation of iodine 125-iodo-LDL was determined as a function of time and concentration of low-density lipoprotein. The maximal specific binding of low-density lipoprotein was also determined. The rate of uptake, degradation, and the maximal binding of low-density lipoprotein was similar in skin fibroblasts of infants with anencephaly and normal subjects. We conclude that the elevated level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in cord blood of fetuses with anencephaly is not caused by deficiency of low-density lipoprotein receptors and metabolism in skin fibroblasts but instead by deficiency of low-density lipoprotein receptors and metabolism by atrophic adrenal glands.\r"

This stimulus was applied for 5 seconds on the maternal abdomen over the fetal head after a 20-minute period of decreased fetal heart rate variability. All fetuses reacted with an immediate fetal heart rate acceleration of at least 10 bpm (range: 10 to 35 bpm, mean +/- SD = 18.4 +/- 7.0), and 19 fetuses also had sudden fetal body movement. A deceleration of the fetal heart rate after the initial acceleration was observed in nine fetuses (range: 15 to 70 bpm, mean +/- SD = 45.5 +/- 16.5). The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the possible use of fetal vibratory acoustic stimulation for intrapartum surveillance.\r"

Glycemic control was modestly but not significantly superior in the diabetic exercise group 2 compared with the diabetic nonexercise group 4. Exercise was associated with lower fasting cholesterol and triglyceride values in both controls and diabetic women, with significantly lower fasting plasma triglyceride levels in the diabetic exercise group (p less than 0.02).

There was an immediate fetal heart rate response, following stimulus, characterized by an increase in duration of fetal heart rate accelerations from 26 weeks to term with an increase in basal fetal heart rate after 30 weeks. There was also a delayed response after 33 weeks' gestation, which consisted of an increase in the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and the incidence of gross fetal body movements for up to 1 hour after a 5-second stimulus with the electronic artificial larynx. Term (36 to 40 weeks) fetuses made breathing movements more irregularly after vibratory acoustic stimulation.

To conduct these studies, a hysterotomy was performed on the pregnant ewe at 110 to 118 days' gestation to implant stainless steel electrodes in the fetal scalp and a hearing aid receiver in the fetal external ear canal. The fetus was returned to the uterus and the pregnancy was allowed to continue. Auditory brain stem responses from younger fetuses (115 to 125 days' gestation) were present at the slower click rates but were not observed consistently at the fast click rates until the fetuses were older (125 to 136 day's gestation). Latency values of the auditory brain stem response peaks decreased with increasing fetal age and increased with increasing stimulus rates. From a two-way analysis of variance, the influence of age and click rate alone and more important, the interaction of age and click rate were determined to have highly significant effects (p less than 0.001) on latency values of wave 1, wave V, and central conduction time. These auditory brain stem response results suggest that the cochlear component of the fetal auditory system undergoes rapid change in late gestation to process incoming stimuli at a faster rate.\r"

  ".W": "There are few objective data to support the clinical impression that pregnancy exerts a beneficial effect on endometriosis. In this study, we examined the progression-regression of endometriosis in pregnant and nonpregnant monkeys. Endometriosis was surgically induced in 16 monkeys and classified as minimal (n = 5), mild (n = 5), moderate (n = 4), or severe (n = 2). Monkeys were mated and pregnancy occurred in three monkeys with minimal, three with mild, and one with moderate endometriosis. Laparotomy was performed to stage the disease and to obtain biopsy specimens of implants 1 month post partum or 6 to 8 months after initial operation in nonpregnant monkeys. Monkeys with minimal and mild disease had complete regression of macroscopic disease. Histologic examination of the implants showed only fibrosis and hemosiderin deposits, except in one animal with mild endometriosis containing microscopic foci of endometrial glands. The one monkey with moderate disease had significant, but not complete regression of implants. Endometriosis in nonpregnant monkeys tended to progress. These findings demonstrate that pregnancy does exert a beneficial effect on endometriosis and suggest that pregnancy commonly results in complete resolution of minimal or mild disease.\r"

Of the 21 patients in whom spinal anesthesia was used for delivery, ten patients with preeclampsia with therapeutic serum magnesium levels made up the study group and 11 term nontreated normotensive gravid women served as controls. At the time of spinal anesthesia, a 1 ml aliquot of cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from each patient. The mean cerebrospinal fluid magnesium level for the control group was 2.56 +/- 0.19 mg/dl (range 2.2 to 2.8 mg/dl). For the preeclamptic group who received intravenous magnesium sulfate, the mean cerebrospinal fluid magnesium level was 3.04 +/- 0.12 mg/dl (range 2.9 to 3.2 mg/dl). Although only a small amount of magnesium crosses the blood-brain barrier after intravenous magnesium sulfate treatment, this increment is highly significant (p less than 0.001).\r"

The tympanic membrane and ossicles were removed and all turns of each cochlea were unroofed with destruction carried to the modiolus. Mean local cerebral glucose utilization of 33 of 34 gray matter structures and four of four white matter structures in operated animals were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that in unoperated control fetuses. The depression in local cerebral glucose utilization was greatest (p less than 0.002) in brain stem auditory nuclei, in which the mean rate of glucose utilization was approximately 25% of the levels in unoperated fetuses. The pattern of glucose utilization in these structures was clearly altered, with a reversal of the normal distribution in density of the inferior colliculus. Tonotopic bands of high local cerebral glucose utilization frequently seen in autoradiographs of inferior colliculus in unoperated fetuses were not observed in operated fetuses. These results show that the glucose utilization of the brain, and by implication the normal growth and maturation of the brain, depends on an intact auditory system during prenatal life.\r"

Thirteen singleton fetuses were studied from day 120 of pregnancy. Embolization was achieved by injecting approximately 9 X 10(6) microspheres of 15 micron diameter into the fetal placental cotyledons along the umbilical arteries over 9 days. Umbilical and uterine flows were measured by radioactive microsphere counting. The umbilical placental resistance was increased (0.25 to 0.35 mm Hg.ml.min-1) by embolization, and there was an increase in the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio. Embolization produced a significant fall in umbilical flow expressed either as total flow (312 to 237 ml.min-1) or when normalized by reference against splanchnic flow (3.36 to 1.53). We conclude that the umbilical artery flow velocity waveform systolic/diastolic ratio measures the reflection coefficient at the peripheral vascular bed (the \"resistance vessels\") of the placenta.\r"

At the end of therapy, endometrial biopsy specimens in group I revealed inactive endometrium, whereas one of ten biopsy specimens in group II showed proliferative endometrium. Blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were not significantly altered from baseline in either group during the 9-month treatment. Vaginal bleeding was virtually eliminated in group I by the end of the study, while 80% of the patients in group II continued to have cyclic menses (p less than 0.001). This pilot study suggests that continuous conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy appears to be a satisfactory method of postmenopausal hormone replacement, effectively reducing menopausal symptoms without any apparent short-term alterations in serum lipids. It has the added benefit of eliminating cyclic menstrual flow.\r"

Amniotic fluid was obtained from four groups of women with premature rupture of membranes: group 1, women without labor or infection; group 2, women with labor but without infection; group 3, women with intra-amniotic infection but without labor; and group 4, women with both infection and labor. 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and leukotriene B4 were measured by radioimmunoassays. Amniotic fluid concentrations of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were found not to differ significantly among the four groups. Amniotic fluid concentrations of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in group 4 were significantly higher than in women in groups 1 and 3 (p less than 0.05). In addition, amniotic fluid concentrations in leukotriene B4 were significantly higher in group 4 than in any of the other three groups (p less than 0.05). Leukotriene B4 concentrations were higher in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1, suggesting that the presence of both labor and infection increases the concentration of this metabolite in amniotic fluid. Infection and labor had an additive effect in the elevation of amniotic fluid concentrations of leukotriene B4. These results suggest that the amniotic fluid concentrations of arachidonate lipoxygenase metabolites are affected differently by the presence of infection and labor in women with premature rupture of membranes.\r"

During periods of spontaneous uterine contractility, a 500 micrograms nicardipine bolus was injected intravenously, and this was followed by continuous infusion (6 micrograms/kg/min) to the mother for 1 hour. Uterine activity (amniotic fluid pressure) and maternal heart rate and blood pressure were monitored continuously. Paired maternal and fetal blood samples were drawn at frequent intervals to monitor pH, PO2, PCO2, and plasma nicardipine concentrations. Peak maternal nicardipine concentrations ranged from 175 to 865 ng/ml while peak fetal levels ranged from 7 to 35 ng/ml. Fetal heart rate and blood pressure were unaffected. However, fetuses became acidotic (pH 7.26 +/- 0.01 versus 7.33 +/- 0.01) and hypoxemic (PO2 16.0 +/- 3.2 versus 24.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) after maternal nicardipine treatment (p less than 0.01).

We therefore studied the effects of RU486 on uterine activity and amniotic fluid prostaglandins in four rhesus macaques implanted with amniotic fluid and maternal vascular catheters and with fetal electrocardiogram and uterine electromyogram electrodes at 119 to 124 days' gestation (term = 168 days). Uterine electromyogram, intra-amniotic pressure (hourly contraction area, mm Hg.sec/hr), and fetal electrocardiogram were monitored continuously. After a stabilization period (6 to 9 days) RU486 was administered orally (20 mg/kg/day) at 1000 hours for 3 days. Uterine activity increased from basal levels (less than 4000 mm Hg.sec/hr) 8 hours after the first dose of RU486, reaching levels of 12,000 mm Hg.sec/hr. A sustained increase in uterine activity (13,000 to 30,000 mm Hg.sec/hr) was observed for 48 hours before cesarean section with little or no cervical effacement or dilatation. Increases in amniotic fluid prostaglandin F2 alpha, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-11 beta, 16 epsilon-cycloprostaglandin E2 occurred 40 hours after the onset of increased uterine activity. In contrast, amniotic fluid prostaglandins in the control animals delivering at term (n = 4) increased 24 to 48 hours before significant increases in uterine activity occurred. Control animals but not those given RU486 demonstrated a progressive nocturnal peak in uterine activity before delivery. Progesterone receptor blockade stimulates intense preterm uterine activity but not the orderly sequence of changes in prostaglandins and cervical status observed during normal parturition.\r"

Preductal arterial and sagittal vein blood samples were analyzed for oxygen content, blood gases, pH, and ethanol. Cerebral and cotylendonary blood flow were measured with a radioactive microsphere technique. Fetal blood gases and pH changed little with the ethanol infusions, although PaO2 and oxygen content decreased 24 hours after ethanol infusion. Cotylendonary blood flow, which was decreased after the third and fourth ethanol infusions, did not account for these delayed hypoxemic changes. Similarly, cerebral oxidative metabolism was decreased when measured after each of the ethanol infusions, with no dose response or tolerance evident. This noted fall in fetal cerebral oxidative metabolism appears to be a direct depressant effect that was maximal at rather low fetal ethanol levels, which, if prolonged, might well affect cerebral growth and development. Recovery of cerebral metabolic function appeared complete by 24 hours. However, relative fetal hypoxemia was evident at this time, the mechanism of which remains to be determined.\r"

In an effort to evaluate the risks associated with a trial of labor, a prospective investigation was undertaken from July 1, 1982, through June 30, 1984. During the first year of the study, patients with a known vertical scar or more than one prior cesarean birth were excluded from an attempted trial of labor. Beginning July 1, 1983, patients with two prior cesarean births were no longer excluded and were studied prospectively. During this 2-year period, 32,854 patients were delivered of their infants at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center. Of these patients, 2708 (8.2%) had undergone a prior cesarean birth, and 1796 women (66%) underwent a trial of labor. A total of 1465 (81%) of them achieved a vaginal delivery. Successful vaginal delivery by the number of prior cesarean sections was as follows: one, 82%; two, 72%; three, 90%. When contrasted with the group without a trial of labor, the group with a trial of labor had significantly less maternal morbidity. In a comparison of the groups with and without a trial of labor, the incidence of uterine dehiscence (1.9% versus 1.9%) and rupture (0.3% versus 0.5%) was similar. With the application of attempted vaginal delivery in our patients with a previous cesarean birth, we were able to reduce our cesarean delivery rate for this population alone by 54%. In summary, the benefits associated with a trial of labor in the patient with a prior cesarean birth far outweigh the risks. The policy of \"once a cesarean section, always a cesarean section\" should be abandoned.\r"

Lecithin phosphorus concentration greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/dl and positive or strong positive Amniostat-FLM results were considered mature. The results of both assays were concordant in 79% of the samples. The discordance rate was highest in GIII patients. In our experience, respiratory distress syndrome did not develop in neonate infants of diabetic women delivered after a mature lecithin result. With lecithin phosphorus concentration as the reference standard, the predictive value of a mature Amniostat-FLM result was 96.2%, whereas that of an immature result was 58.5%. Respiratory distress syndrome occurred in only two GIII neonates who were delivered within 72 hours of both immature lecithin and Amniostat-FLM results. These findings support the use of Aminostat-FLM as a screening test for fetal lung maturity in both normal and diabetic pregnancies. Additional tests will be necessary to evaluate further fetal lung maturity only if the results are negative.\r"

Forty-six patients with well-established dates were evaluated with semiweekly biophysical profiles and umbilical artery flow velocimetry (characterized by the ratio of the peak systolic to end-diastolic velocity). Their labor records were reviewed, and neonates were examined for signs of postmaturity. Twenty neonates had an abnormal test result or outcome (identified as an abnormal nonstress test, oligohydramnios, meconium, intrapartum fetal distress, or a 5-minute Apgar score less than 7). Nine neonates had a physical examination consistent with the postmaturity syndrome. Twenty-one neonates were entirely normal. Comparisons of the mean systolic/diastolic ratios for neonates with and without the complications associated with postdatism showed no significant differences. In addition, all systolic/diastolic ratios were within the normal range. Therefore, umbilical artery flow velocimetry is unlikely to be useful for the routine antenatal assessment of the postdate fetus.\r"

To evaluate postliquefaction proteolytic breakdown of seminal plasma proteins, protease inhibitors were added to the semen at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after ejaculation. Most seminal plasma proteins in normospermic men (n = 4) had molecular weights of 30,000 to 70,000 and were similar to those present in serum. The major non-serum protein in seminal plasma of all men was a basic product with an approximate molecular weight of 40,000. A group of proteins (molecular weights = 20,000 to 23,000) in seminal plasma analyzed immediately after liquefaction was detected in oligospermic men (n = 4) but not in normospermic men (n = 4) or azoospermic men (n = 4). When protease inhibitor was added to normospermic semen at greater than or equal to 15 minutes after liquefaction, these proteins (molecular weight = 20,000 to 23,000) and another group of proteins (molecular weights = 40,000 to 43,000) were readily identifiable but were further enhanced in the absence of protease inhibitors.

  ".W": "Continuous wave Doppler studies were carried out on both uterine arteries in 71 pregnant women from the twentieth week of gestation onward. Analysis of the waveform included the systolic/diastolic ratio and the presence or absence of a diastolic notch. In the current study, these ratios from 31 women with left/right systolic/diastolic difference, (between left and right uterine arteries) were compared with those of women having normal ratios. A normal left/right systolic/diastolic ratio difference of 0.3 with SD of 0.3 was found. When the left/right difference was plotted against the left/right averaged systolic/diastolic ratio, a correlation coefficient of 0.7 was noted (p less than 0.001). Significant outcome differences were noted between normal and abnormal left/right difference systolic/diastolic ratios in the perinatal parameters of gestational age at delivery, fetal weight, pregnancy-induced hypertension, proteinuria, and intrauterine growth retardation. Divergent uterine artery ratio findings are a result of one artery being the dominant supplier to the placenta. The majority of women with an elevated systolic/diastolic ratio seem to have divergent uterine blood supply to the uterus and placenta. These data suggest that errors in placentation site contribute to the development of preeclampsia and growth retardation in the fetus.\r"

Rabbits were used in this study because this species, unlike the rat, has a sex steroid-binding protein. The impact of capillary membrane permeability markedly varied with different steroids and did not completely parallel the lipid solubility of these compounds. The addition of plasma proteins to the injection vehicle had varied inhibitory effects on the in vivo extractions by the uterus. These in vivo extraction values could not be predicted from in vitro studies of steroid binding to plasma proteins and the results underscore the importance of performing in vivo studies so that we may have a better understanding of the bioavailability of steroids to tissues.\r"

Hypoxemia was induced by an infusion of nitrogen via the maternal trachea for 24 hours in 13 pregnant sheep at 122 to 139 days' gestation. Two control periods of air infusion via the maternal trachea for 24 hours were alternated with hypoxemia. Fetal hypoxemia was not associated with any change in fetal pH. During the first and second exposures to hypoxemia, there was an increase in fetal plasma lactate of 22.8 +/- 22.3 and 15.3 +/- 14.6 mg.dl-1 (mean +/- SD) above preliminary values (p less than 0.05) compared with the control period. Fetal plasma cortisol also increased by 5.7 +/- 6.1 and 9.5 +/- 5.4 ng.ml-1 (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.05) compared with the control period.

  ".W": "Rat thoracic aortas were denuded of endothelial cells with a fine nylon filament, which removed a row of endothelium approximately 100 mu in width and caused platelets to adhere to the exposed subendothelium. A further group of rats was subjected to a sham operation where only the abdominal aorta was injured, and another group of rats was used as controls. Each animal was continuously labeled with 3H-thymidine (6.7 Ci/mM, 10 microCi/hr) for 7 days, at which time they were killed and the aortas perfusion-fixed with aldehydes. Sections of each aorta were processed for autoradiography. The thoracic aortas from animals subjected to the nylon filament injury showed no intimal thickening, but there was a significant increase in the thymidine index of the medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as compared with aortas from sham operation or control animals (1.02% +/- 0.44% versus 0.19% +/- 0.13% versus 0.15% +/- 0.12%). This experiment showed that continuous administration of 3H-thymidine permitted the detection of a small but significant increase in replication rates that could not be detected by the standard bolus administration of 3H-thymidine, and that selected loss of endothelium with minimal trauma to the vessel wall caused SMC proliferation without intimal thickening. These findings suggest that platelets may indeed provide SMC proliferation, but that migration of these cells into the intima may be controlled by different factor(s).\r"

The tumors were strikingly similar to those occurring in man both with regard to histologic features and growth patterns. The authors have cultured cells from these tumors and established epithelial lines with a variety of karyologic features and doubling times shorter than those of normal mesothelial cells. Lines of diploid or near-diploid tumor cells required serum in the medium to replicate, whereas most aneuploid cell lines were maintained in a serum-free medium. In serum-free medium, the aneuploid line monolayers produced anchorage-independent excrescent masses of cells which \"bud\" and float free. These spheroids, which strikingly resemble the papillary structures in human mesotheliomas, are composed of mesothelial-like cells that produce hyaluronic acid and have a rich complement of intermediate filaments, predominantly cytokeratins. Aneuploid cells also replicated in soft agar with high efficiency, whereas the diploid and near-diploid cells did not. All but one cultured cell line, regardless of karyotype, produced tumors after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal inoculation (or both). Aneuploid cells caused lung tumors sporadically when introduced intravenously. Comparative analysis of the nuclear DNA of primary tumors and cultured cells demonstrated a high degree of chromosomal instability and selection among cells during early passage in vitro.\r"

The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) was 0% at 12 weeks, 22% at 16 weeks, 39% at 20 weeks, and 53% at 24 weeks. In 29 of the 35 (W x B)F1 male mice with MI, small multiple infarctions were noted in the right ventricular free wall and anterior, lateral, posterior, and septal ventricular walls. In 25 of the 29 hearts with multiple infarcts, the infarcts in the same heart were at the same histologic stage. Twenty-one of these hearts showed only replacement fibrosis, and 4 hearts showed only granulation. The remaining 4 hearts with multiple infarcts exhibited coagulation necrosis plus fibrosis or granulation. Quantitative analysis of the infarct size revealed that in the 35 (W x B)F1 males with MI, the relative area of MI (%MI) was significantly larger in the right ventricular free wall (6.7% +/- 8.4%) than in the ventricular septum (1.9% +/- 2.4%) or in the left ventricular free wall (2.1% +/- 2.5%). The %MI was greatest in the right third (3.6% +/- 5.4%) of the ventricular septum and in the outer third (2.9% +/- 3.3%) of the left ventricular free wall. The %MI did not increase with age. In 11 of the 35 (W x B)F1 mice, 27 intramural small arteries showed marked obliterative lesions. Most of them were in the right ventricular free wall, the right third of the ventricular septum, or the outer third of the left ventricular free wall. There was no evidence of stenosis in the extracardiac major coronary arteries. In addition, the infarct showed a whirlpool-like configuration, and x-ray photographs revealed that the small intramural coronary arteries had a whirlpool-like configuration. It is concluded that in (W x B)F1 males multiple small infarcts appear at the same time due to small coronary artery disease. The whirlpool configuration of the infarct reflects the special anatomy of the intramural coronary arteries in the mice.\r"

  ".W": "Changes were examined in the expression of Class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens by autochthonous cells of the terminal ileum affected by Crohn's disease. The study was based on the analysis of transmural specimens from terminal ileum segments obtained in the course of ileocolectomy for colon cancer and Crohn's disease. Serial sections were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies directed against monomorphic determinants of HLA-A,B,C, DR, DP, DQ, and the invariant chain (Ii) associated with Class II molecules. Compared with the normal state, the only change in Class I antigen expression occurring in Crohn's disease was the induction of HLA-A,B,C antigens in lymphatic endothelium. Changes in Class II antigen expression were more substantial. Enhancement of HLA-DR expression was found in enterocytes; DR induction was observed in glial cells of the visceral nervous plexus and in venular and venous endothelium. HLA-DP and DQ antigens were induced in enterocytes, glial cells, and capillary and venular endothelium, although this induction was restricted to areas of moderate or high inflammatory activity. The tissue distribution of Ii closely resembled that of HLA-DR, although this association was not strict: on the one hand, arterial endothelium contained low amounts of Ii in the absence of DR antigens; on the other hand, glial cells expressed Class II molecules in the absence of Ii. The extent of local enhancement/induction of MHC antigens was positively correlated with the local density of the cellular infiltrate. These data suggest that altered MHC antigen expression by autochthonous structures might be mediated by factors released from the lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, which is itself attracted by an unknown signal. In conjunction with an unknown antigen, the enhanced expression of Class II antigens might trigger an autoaggressive immune response.\r"

Primary skeletoblast cell cultures were established from humeri and calvaria of 3-day-old, 7-day-old, and 28-day-old animals. Infectious ecotropic MuLV was found in all humerus cultures from infected animals and in 7-day and 28-day calvaria cell cultures. Levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were markedly higher in cultures of calvaria and humeri from infected mice than in those from controls. In vitro infection of undifferentiated periosteal cells was followed by a decrease in cell growth and an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, differentiated osteoblast-like cells were barely susceptible to OA MuLV infection, and the virus did not influence their cell growth or differentiation. Electron-microscopic studies of skeletal tissue from infected old osteopetrotic mice showed virus particles associated with and budding from osteocytes and accumulated in devitalized osteocyte lacunae. The results indicate that progenitor cells of the osteoblastic lineage represent the target cells for OA MuLV in bone tissue, that virus infection induces an increase in osteoblastic activity, and that infected cells produce virus until full development of the disease.\r"

On Days 1-3 in culture, the colonies were composed of a monolayer of poorly-differentiated flattened cells. Most of these were large cells which appeared to be altered secretory (mucous) cells. On Days 4 and 5, many of the epithelial cells were cuboidal. The rough endoplasmic reticulum was moderately developed, and mucous granules were seen at the cell apices. Preciliated and newly formed ciliated cells were observed on Day 6, and a differentiated mucociliary epithelium was established by Day 7 in culture. The study shows that in the hamster tracheal epithelium, the stages of normal fetal development and regeneration following injury, which have been characterized previously in vivo, are recapitulated in vitro. Formation of a mucociliary tracheal epithelium occurs within 7 days in vito and in vitro.\r"

Extracts from both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney and spleen yielded similar monomers and dimers of the AA protein. The additional high-molecular-weight bands and a distinct 12,000-dalton fragment in the amyloid protein extracted from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung suggest that different processing of proteins, ie, by polymerization and/or degradation, may occur in different organs.\r"

Rather than promoting tumorigenesis in vasopressinergic cells of the hypothalamus, expression and activity of the hybrid oncogene, and consequent tumor formation, were confined to insulin-producing beta cells of the endocrine pancreas and to cells in the anterior pituitary. These observations suggest that the specificity of vasopressin gene expression normally results from an interaction between several regulatory elements, some of which are absent from the hybrid oncogene. The possible relationship between the endocrine tumor syndrome found in the vasopressin-SV40 transgenic mice and familial human multiple endocrine neoplasia is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "88103953\r", 
  ".W": "In the rat, both IgG and IgA immune complexes induce oxygen radical mediated lung injury that is partially complement-dependent. In vivo studies have suggested that the chief sources of oxygen radicals in IgG and IgA immune complex-induced lung injury are neutrophils and tissue macrophages, respectively. The current studies have been designed to provide additional insights into these two models of tissue injury. Preformed monoclonal IgG and IgA immune complexes stimulated dose-dependent O2-. and H2O2 production by alveolar macrophages. In contrast, neutrophils exhibited O2-. production and lysosomal enzyme secretion in response to IgG immune complexes, but not in response to IgA complexes. There is evidence that C5a significantly amplifies these responses. Purified human C5a enhanced the O2-. responses of neutrophils activated with IgG immune complexes and alveolar macrophages activated with either IgG or IgA immune complexes. Addition of C5a alone to neutrophils or alveolar macrophages had no direct stimulatory effect as measured by O2-. production. The observation that O2-. responses of immune complex-activated alveolar macrophages can be significantly enhanced by the presence of C5a and that C5a can also enhance O-2. responses of IgG immune complex-stimulated neutrophils suggests a potential amplification mechanism through which complement may participate in both IgG and IgA immune complex-induced lung injury. The present data corroborate in vivo studies which suggest that IgG immune complex lung injury is primarily neutrophil-mediated, whereas IgA complex lung injury is predominantly macrophage-mediated.\r"

  ".U": "88103954\r", 
  ".W": "The elaborate cytoskeletal matrix underlying the intestinal epithelial cell brush border (BB) is the hallmark of a mature enterocyte. As such, alterations in this structure are potentially useful as markers aiding in the recognition of subtle defects in cell maturation, such as those accompanying dysplasia and neoplasia. For exploration of this hypothesis, the BB components of human ileal and colonic enterocytes have been compared structurally and biochemically with the well-characterized avian BB, and alterations in the BB cytoskeleton in various states of dysplasia and neoplasia have been identified. Ultrastructural analysis of isolated human ileal BBs indicate that the human BB is structurally homologous to BBs isolated from chicken and other mammalian sources. Like other mammalian BBs (eg, from rat) the terminal web cytoskeleton of the human BB is less extensive than that in the avian BB. Immunochemical analysis of isolated human BBs indicates that the major proteins of the avian microvillar actin bundle, villin, fimbrin, and the 110-kd subunit of the 110K-calmodulin complex, are all present in the human BB. The terminal web protein myosin is also present. Unlike the terminal web of the avian BB, which contains a BB-specific isoform of spectrin, TW 260/240, the human BB contains the more widely distributed spectrin isoform, fodrin. In addition, the human BB contains multiple proteins immunoreactive with antibodies to protein 4.1, a spectrin/actin binding protein that is absent from the avian BB. Immunolocalization studies examining the distribution of the BB-specific microvillar protein, villin, in human colonic mucosa indicate that the localization of this protein is disrupted in certain dysplastic and neoplastic states. Thus, both the expression and/or distribution of BB-specific proteins such as villin may be useful markers for defects in the differentiation state of the enterocyte.\r"

  ".W": "One ACL in each of 11 mature goats was replaced with a freeze dried bone-ACL-bone allograft and a ligament augmentation device (LAD). The LAD was released from its tibial fixation at 3 months postoperation. Biomechanical, microvascular, and histological changes were evaluated 1 year following implantation. The reconstructed knees had a significantly greater total AP translation (3.1 +/- 0.5 mm) (mean and SEM) than the contralateral controls (1.0 +/- 0.1 mm). Differences in primary AP translation were responsible for 59% of the difference in total translation, with only a 0.6 mm difference in secondary translation. Neutral stiffness in the reconstructive knee was 22% of control, while stiffness at 30 N of anterior force was approximately 35% of controls. Ligament stiffness in the linear region for the ACL allograft/LAD was 53% of the control value of 691 N/mm. The maximum load of the allograft/LADs was 1,052 +/- 145 N, or 43% of the contralateral ACL control strength (2,448 +/- 144 N). Five of the six allografts failed at the femoral insertion. Energy (39%) to maximum load was less for allograft/LADs than controls but elongation to maximum load was the same as control. Histologic evaluation of the allograft/LADs revealed soft tissue cellular ingrowth into the LAD in the extraarticular portions. No bony growth into the LAD was observed. The collagen fibers of the graft appear to be arranged in a longitudinal orientation although some areas show chaotic collagen fibers. Microangiography revealed a periligamentous and endoligamentous vascular pattern reminiscent of a normal ACL and complete revascularization of the bone plugs.\r"

  ".W": "The large number of reconstructive procedures in the treatment of ACL reflect a lack of consistent clinical success, thus creating the current controversy over the treatment of ACL injuries. The purpose of this study on the relationship of the femoral attachment site to the isometric tracking of the ACL graft was three-fold: 1) to develop a method for evaluating the femoral attachment site for the ideal isometric graft tracking pattern; 2) to develop a reference table comparing femoral attachment sites to graft excursion; and 3) to apply this information to the surgical procedure to allow for stepwise refinement of the attachment site for improved clinical results. To aid in graphic representation, the attachment sites were identified from radiographs by the sclerotic margin of the drill hole in the bone or the bone trough. These attachment sites were transferred to a trace diagram and compiled to form a composite diagram. Three distinct graft tracking patterns were identified. Group I represented the modified \"over-the-top\" technique with a deep cancellous bone trough and represented the most isometric tracking. Group II represented the modified over-the-top technique with a shallow or no cancellous bone trough and Group III the drill hole technique. Groups II and III were nonisometric. In surgery, palpation of the graft for excursion while performing a range of motion allows for review of isometric graft tracking. Stepwise intraoperative refinement of the femoral attachment site can result in isometric graft tracking.\r"

The 3.6 mm diamond-braided prosthesis was implanted in 17 dogs. The device was passed through a trough on the anteromedial side of the tibial crest and over the top of the lateral femoral condyle. The device was internally fixed at both ends to bone using a bushing-lag screw technique which resulted in solid prosthesis immobilization at the time of surgery. Animals were necropsied at 3, 6, or 10 months after implantation. There was partial or total disruption of the prosthesis in all cases. Destruction of the prosthesis was attributed to excessive viscoelasticity of the device and fatigue failure. Based on this study, prosthetic ACL replacement using this device is not recommended.\r"

Three groups were compared: Group I, bilateral ACL tears; Group II, unilateral tears; and Group III, normal knees. Notch dimensions were computer-generated from CT scans. All patients were examined for ligamentous laxity. Statistically significant differences were found between normal and ACL-injured knees in regard to opening notch angle, ratio of notch width at two-thirds of the notch length to condylar width, and ratio of maximum notch width to condylar width, suggesting a significant association between anterior outlet stenosis and unilateral and bilateral ACL tears. The shapes of the notches were determined from tracings of the distal CT scan. Shapes ranged from inverted U to cresting wave. Narrow notches tended to be waveshaped, but more study is needed in this area. Notch-plasty is recommended for those with documented stenosis. The ratio of maximum notch width at two-thirds of the notch height to maximum condyle width should not be much less than 0.2, and the opening notch angle should be at least 50 degrees.\r"

Presented here is a prospective study of isolated posterior cruciate injuries seen in the acute stage in 13 patients, 6 males and 7 females. The diagnosis of posterior cruciate ligament tear was made clinically and confirmed by arthroscopy. The average age at injury was 22 years. The athletic activity at injury was varied. Hyperflexion was the most common mechanism of injury, followed by pretibial trauma in the hyperflexed knee or in the \"dashboard\" injury. There were seven complete midsubstance tears and five partial tears. Direct visualization of the posterior cruciate ligament was not attained in one patient. All patients were treated nonoperatively on a physiotherapy routine. Average followup was 2.6 years. Patients were clinically examined and subjected to KT-1000 and Cybex testing. All patients were able to return to their previous activity and experienced no limitations with their injured knees. Using Hughston's criteria, subjective and functional ratings were all good. However, only 3 rated good and 10 fair when assessed objectively. We conclude that acceptable functional stability in these patients does not necessarily require absolute static stability. Nonoperative treatment of the isolated posterior cruciate ligament midsubstance injury may be a viable alternative to the difficult repair/reconstruction procedure.\r"

The lack of contact trauma preceding symptoms, the failure of the athlete to appreciate the instability, the relative rarity that the lesion has been previously recognized and reported, and the lack of objective evidence of instability often lead to incorrect diagnosis by the physician. We report 30 shoulders in 28 patients with this lesion. Nineteen of these patients had been originally seen by other physicians prior to presenting to us and misdiagnosed. The newly described apical oblique roentgenographic projection revealed Hill-Sach's lesions in 23 of 28 patients in this series. In addition, two of the five patients without Hill-Sach's lesions had bony changes pathognomonic for the Bankart lesion on the apical oblique projection. A total of 25 of the 28 patients had objective roentgenographic evidence of previous anterior subluxation. Eleven of the patients had arthroscopic examinations confirming various pathology consistent with anterior subluxation, including anterior or inferior labral tears, Hill-Sach's lesions, anterior inferior glenoid articular cartilaginous erosion, or Bankart lesions. Two of the twenty-eight patients had pathology in addition to evidence of previous occult subluxation which may have played a role in their symptoms, one having had osteolysis of the distal end of the clavicle and another having subacromical adhesions.\r"

Seven were major league baseball pitchers and six were amateur pitchers. The act of pitching a fast ball was filmed at 450 frames per second with the EMG signals recorded synchronously. The subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles were tested in 13 subjects, the biceps brachii muscle was tested in 12, and other shoulder muscles were tested variously among the subjects. Two groups of muscles were identified. Group I muscles, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, deltoid, trapezius, and biceps brachii, served primarily to position the shoulder and elbow for the delivery of the pitch. These muscles were found to have greater activity during the early and late cooking stages, with less activity during acceleration. Group II muscles accelerated the arm and baseball forward in space. These muscles, the pectoralis major, serratus anterior, subscapularis, and latissimus dorsi, had stronger activity during the propulsive phase of the pitch. The professional pitchers were able to use the muscles about the shoulder in an efficient manner to achieve greater pitching velocities. The subscapularis and latissimus dorsi muscles of Group II had stronger activity among the professionals, whereas the supraspinatus, teres minor, and biceps brachii muscles of Group I had only minimal activity. The amateurs, on the other hand, continued to use all of the rotator cuff muscles and the biceps brachii muscle of Group I through the acceleration stage of the pitch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medical coverage for the Games was provided by the University of Iowa Sports Medicine Service. Staffing for the events involved approximately 75 physicians, 60 athletic trainers, and other health care personnel. A triage protocol was established prior to the Games whereby the athletic trainer would make first contact with the injured athlete and would evaluate and treat the injury based on standing orders. If in the judgment of the trainer, the athlete needed to be referred to a physician, one would be available, either on site or on call. During the Games, 1,113 medical encounters were recorded, 121 of those being deemed serious enough to withhold an athlete from competition pending further evaluation and treatment. The 121 significant injuries and illnesses involved 116 athletes (66% male, 34% female). Thirty-four percent of the significant injuries only required treatment by the trainer, while 46% were referred to an on site physician and 20% needed a specialty consultant. Seventeen percent of the significant injuries resulted in the athlete being medically disqualified for the remainder of the event. The most common injuries/illnesses were contusions (26%), sprains (21%), heat (17%), strains (9%), and other illnesses (12%). According to body region, 44% of the 121 injuries were to the lower extremity, 26% to the head, neck, and trunk, and 12% to the upper extremity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Microscopic hematuria was present in two runners before the race. After this strenuous exercise there was macroscopic hematuria in five runners (19.2%) and microscopic hematuria in nine (34.6%). On examination by phase contrast microscopy there were neither dysmorphic erythrocytes nor red cell casts. Albuminuria was measured by radial immunodiffusion and was expressed as Ualb/Ucreat and Ualb/Uosm ratios. Clinical albuminuria was found in five runners with macroscopic hematuria, and microalbuminuria in 13 of the 21 remainders; in 6 of them it was associated with microscopic hematuria. Twenty-four hours later all of the results were normal with the exception of the five runners who have had macroscopic hematuria and another one with microalbuminuria without hematuria. We conclude that determination of albumin excretion in runners after exercise should be made as well as hematuria, and particular attention should be paid to cases of severe and/or prolonged microalbuminuria, since such individuals may be at risk of renal disease.\r"

Surgeons cannot afford gaps in their medical education regarding the communication process with patients. We found that many surgical residents and faculty understand the mechanics of the informed consent process quite well and could perform well under the artificial circumstances of our video interview. Whether they would do as well if a real patient was considering nonoperative therapy, or was a ne'er-do-well, or an alcoholic is not known. Two main causes of interference with the process have been identified: conflicting messages which surgeons get from within the profession, from the courts, and from within themselves and lack of time for dialogue with patients, and poor timing of the consent process. Areas that were uncovered that need further investigation include the barrier created by some surgeons' internal, often unrecognized, biases about surgery being the only satisfactory mode of treatment for some illnesses and some surgeons' belief that longevity should be the goal of all therapy, without considering that for some patients, maintenance of certain quality lifestyles is more important than a longer life. We hope that surgeons can learn to look at the informed consent process as a wonderful opportunity to communicate their personal concern for the patient as a person, not just a sick gallbladder to remove, and that this process can become the channel through which the wounded relationship of the patient and the physician can be healed.\r"

The tibio-peroneal arteries were the most commonly injured vessels. After extensive analysis of the records and arteriograms of the involved patients, the following conclusions were drawn: Arteriograms are mandatory for penetrating wounds proximal to major arteries of the extremities because of the 5 to 15 percent incidence of occult injuries; the timing of arteriography in the distal leg is critical if subtle injuries to the tibial and peroneal vessels are to be detected; when experienced radiologists are not available, interpretation of exclusion arteriograms is best performed by experienced trauma surgeons; false aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, or a combination of both continue to be the most common manifestations of missed arterial injuries; failure to find an injury previously diagnosed by a preoperative arteriogram mandates an intraoperative arteriogram and, on occasion, an arteriotomy; and, late arterial repairs usually require segmental resection with an end-to-end anastomosis or insertion of a graft.\r"

Based on the beneficial properties of hypertonic lactated saline solution in burn resuscitation, we have extended its use to acute hemorrhage. Using an awake canine model analogous to the clinical situation, we compared hypertonic lactated saline solution with Ringer's lactate solution for resuscitation in the presence of acute blood loss. The hypertonic lactated saline solution group required less fluid to restore and maintain cardiac output and blood pressure while maintaining better urine output. Although the Ringer's lactate solution group had increased shunt function indicative of pulmonary dysfunction, the shunt function in the hypertonic lactated saline solution group did not differ from that in the control group. Serum sodium and osmolality values were higher in the hypertonic lactated saline solution group, but at no time did they approach toxic levels.\r"

Large numbers of patients are being referred to surgeons for biopsies on the basis of mammographic abnormalities alone. As mammograms are complex studies and the findings often subtle, variation in terms of interpretation and recommendations for biopsy can leave the surgeon in a difficult position. We have reported a systematic method for evaluating patients and mammograms. Eighty-eight patients were referred to a single surgeon solely for an abnormal mammographic finding. Physical examination was repeated and the mammogram reviewed with a single consulting radiologist using specific criteria to define a mammographic abnormality. Through this evaluation, biopsy was avoided in 42 of 88 patients, with follow-up mammograms and physical examinations finding no suspicion of malignancy. By becoming educated in regard to mammographic abnormalities, establishing specific criteria with a consistent radiologist, and following patients carefully who are not biopsied, the surgeon can deal effectively with screening mammography.\r"

The procedure was effective, well tolerated, carried a low morbidity, and resulted in the removal of a minimal amount of breast tissue. It must be emphasized that although mammography and needle localization are useful tools, they are only adjuncts to breast self-examination and clinical observation.\r"

Six conclusions can be drawn from this retrospective review. (1) Vancomycin appears to be the first single drug of choice, especially in cases of gram-positive peritonitis. (2) In our experience, the dialysis catheter should be removed in patients who do not demonstrate major resolution of their peritoneal sepsis by 3 to 4 days. (3) If removal of the dialysis catheter does not resolve the issue within 2 to 3 days, exploratory laparotomy should be seriously considered. (4) If fungal organisms are present, exploration and debridement of the peritoneal cavity should be carried out and the patient should be aggressively treated with systemic amphotericin. This should be undertaken early in the course of the peritonitis. (5) Patients with polycystic kidney disease may be better served by hemodialysis. (6) Patients who experience multiple septic episodes should be, when feasible, electively converted to hemodialysis or should undergo transplantation.\r"

Simple repairs were successful more often than complex ones. Site of injury and perioperative therapeutic adjuncts did not affect results. Eleven limbs were amputated, none solely because of venous injury. Edema was present at last follow-up in fewer patients with patent repairs than occluded repairs or ligations. Repair of major lower extremity venous injuries should be attempted routinely in stable patients. Improved patency of complex repairs may require increased use of balloon catheter thrombectomy and other adjunctive procedures. Postoperative venography is very useful for the evaluation of results.\r"

An analysis of the records of these patients has led to the following conclusions: With a midline penetrating wound and presence of a supramesocolic hematoma or hemorrhage, injury to the suprarenal aorta should be suspected. If a midline supramesocolic hematoma is present or if hemorrhage can be controlled by direct pressure, a lateral approach with medial mobilization of the intraabdominal viscera on the left side allows rapid vascular control. Although lateral aortorrhaphy is preferred, patch grafting, and end-to-end anastomosis, or insertion of a prosthetic graft was required in 46 percent of the patients who underwent repair. As in all previous series, the insertion of synthetic patches or prostheses was not complicated by infection. The average survival rate for injuries to the suprarenal aorta in series reported since 1974 is 33 percent. Finally, the continuing problem of irreversible shock suggests the need for rapid transport from the field to the hospital for victims of penetrating wounds to the abdomen.\r"

In 118 minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with penetrating neck trauma, the combination of esophagography with esophagoscopy identified all 10 esophageal injuries in 118 patients with penetrating neck trauma. These data suggest that patients with penetrating neck trauma and minimal clinical findings should be initially evaluated with arteriography and esophagography. If the results of arteriography or esophagography are positive, then neck exploration should be performed. If the results of esophagography are equivocal, then rigid esophagoscopy should be performed. If all test results are negative, then observation is justified.\r"

We separately analyzed patients with burns of 30 percent total body surface area or greater during both halves of the study with respect to survival and length of hospital stay. Before 1982, patient survival was 59 percent and mean length of hospital stay was 28.1 days. Since that, the survival rate increased to 77 percent and mean length of hospital stay increased to 35.2 days. The early burn mortality rate remained nearly constant during the period of study (17 percent during the first half of the study and 16 percent during the second half), but the late mortality rate decreased significantly during the second half of the study (24 percent versus 8 percent, p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate increased survival rates after major thermal injury due to improvements in prevention and treatment of sepsis and other late complications of thermal injury.\r"

Of these patients, 131 underwent the Goldstein test to determine the presence or absence of a contralateral hernia sac. The Goldstein test was performed by introducing a soft rubber catheter through the hernia sac into the abdominal cavity and distending the peritoneal cavity with air. The contralateral groin and, in males, the scrotum were then palpated for crepitance. The presence of crepitance constituted a positive test result. Of the 131 tests performed, the results were positive in 38 (29 percent) and negative in 93 (71 percent). There was one false-positive test result (2 percent) and no false-negative results. The test was not performed in 60 patients because of technical problems in passing the catheter (22 percent), presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (2 percent), previous contralateral herniorrhaphy (1.6 percent), presentation with bilateral hernias (26 percent), and patient age of 12 years (1 percent). Continued differences in approaches to the management of pediatric patients who present with unilateral groin hernias prompted this study. We believe that the Goldstein test represents a safe, economical, rapid, accurate, and humane approach to this common problem.\r"

In 31 of these patients, other pathologic abnormalities were found to account for the symptoms, thus the number of negative explorations was reduced to 7 percent. The average length of hospitalization was 5.3 days for patients with acute nonperforated appendicitis and 7.3 days for patients with perforated appendicitis. A protocol was followed which consisted of fluid resuscitation, preoperative and postoperative administration of antibiotics, and surgical exploration with appendectomy in all patients. No interval appendectomies were performed. The peritoneal cavity was not irrigated and the use of drains was avoided as much as possible. All wounds were closed primarily without wound drains. Topical cefamandole powder was used in all cases. Aerobic and anaerobic culture specimens were obtained in all cases from the peritoneal cavity and appendiceal stump. Twenty-eight different organisms were recovered, B. fragilis being the most common followed by E. coli. Excellent results were obtained without mortality and a less than 1 percent complication rate. There was a shorter period of hospitalization for patients with perforated appendicitis and a shorter period of antibiotic treatment.\r"

Our study disclosed a concomitant orchiectomy rate of 2 percent during 1,817 groin herniorrhaphies. The risk of orchiectomy was greatest in patients with incarceration (relative risk 22 times) but was also increased by herniorrhaphy for recurrence (relative risk 8 times) (Table II). On the other hand, patients undergoing repair of a primary reducible hernia were at low risk. Of the 29 patients undergoing orchiectomy, only 12 of the procedures were performed for specifically recorded testicular or spermatic cord abnormalities. The precise reason for orchiectomy was often not stated or was vague. We conclude that orchiectomy is more likely to be associated with repair of complicated hernias and that permission for possible orchiectomy should be obtained from these patients preoperatively. On the other hand, consent for orchiectomy and detailed discussion is unwarranted for patients with primary reducible hernias. In addition, orchiectomy during herniorrhaphy should be limited to cases of specific testicular and cord abnormalities, and the reason for orchiectomy should be clearly documented in the operative record.\r"

The clinical picture of a patient who initially manifests a return of gut function and advances to a diet, but then has loss of bowel function with distention and pain is most characteristic of early postoperative small bowel obstruction. Any patient in the high-risk group demonstrating this clinical picture should be presumed to have a mechanical small bowel obstruction, and early operation should be considered.\r"

This obviates the inherent risks of blindly placing bulky spur clamps between the colon and ileum in the postoperative period. Using this technique, we have encountered no staple line leaks, fluid or electrolyte imbalance, or skin excoriation in the postoperative or follow-up period of 26 patients.

Five of these patients (63 percent) died. The mortality rate was 100 percent when buttock necrosis developed. In most of these patients, the neurologic deficit suggested ischemic injury of the lumbosacral plexus rather than spinal cord ischemia.

Presenting complaints included pain (51 percent) and neuropathy (19 percent). Additional morbidity has been discussed. The present study differs from previous ones in that many of the patients had femoral artery pseudoaneurysm formation in the common femoral artery without a history of smoking, diabetes, or hypertension. There was no demonstrable association with anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. The incidence of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm did increase with the use of a catheter sheath from 0.06 to 0.3 percent (p less than 0.005). This has not been reported previously. Direct arterial repair was utilized in 63 patients, whereas arterial reconstruction was required in 7 patients (saphenous vein graft in 4 and prosthetic graft in 3). There was one wound complication but no mortality associated with the surgical repair. Acceptable reasons for repair of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms are persisting or enlarging femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, associated pain or neuropathy, and rupture of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms.\r"

Members, including persons from perinatology, neonatology, genetics, radiology, pathology, pediatric surgery, neurosurgery, and urology, met monthly to discuss new referrals, follow-up ongoing cases, and present findings and treatment in delivered cases. Of 90 referred cases, 76 surgical diagnoses occurred in 71 fetuses (79 percent), with central nervous system and genitourinary anomalies predominating. A formal presentation during a single meeting with the variety of specialists necessary to manage surgical problems in the fetus facilitated perinatal management and allowed for the appropriate specialist to counsel the parents as early as possible.\r"

All of the neonates showed immediate clinical improvement, with a decrease in peak airway pressure and elevation of arterial oxygen pressure levels. There were no complications directly attributable to the procedure. We believe that pneumomediastinum in association with severe hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, and high ventilation pressures indicates clinically significant tension in the mediastinum. This results in a decrease in systemic blood pressure and pulmonary venous return that is not amenable to conservative management. Needle aspiration is inadequate because of the dynamic nature of the air leak. Tube decompression of the mediastinum is the treatment of choice in these circumstances.\r"

Forty-six percent were receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. A specific diagnosis was obtained in 30 of the 46 patients (65 percent). Fifteen of these patients had pulmonary infections. Nonspecific diagnoses were obtained in 16 of the 46 patients (45 percent). Therapy was altered in a total of 27 patients and 17 of these patients responded to treatment. Overall survival at 1 year was 41 percent. Forty-eight percent of the patients in whom therapy was changed survived 1 year, and 31 percent of the patients in whom therapy was not changed survived 1 year. No deaths were attributable to the operative procedure. The complication rate was acceptable. Open lung biopsy is an important technique in evaluating and determining therapy in immunocompromised patients who present with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.\r"

A significant (p less than 0.001) increase in pulmonary artery pressure at constant flow was seen in 10 of 14 dextran and 12 of 15 blood perfusions. The average increase for dextran was 112 percent and for blood, 109 percent. Antihistamines did not inhibit the response. However, this was abolished in all 11 animals treated with aspirin. In 11 intact swine, thromboxane B2 blood levels increased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 0.46 +/- 0.38 ng/dl to 2.97 +/- 1.5 ng/dl. Thus, pulmonary hypertension associated with protamine reversal of heparinization is associated with prostaglandin release from the lung, and this does not require mediation of platelets or leukocytes.\r"

Between 1981 and 1986, 85 patients (41 male and 44 female) aged 1 to 77 years underwent anterior spinal fusion by an orthopedic or general surgery team (33 pediatric patients and 52 adult patients). Thirty-four patients had scoliosis, 8 had kyphosis, 24 had spinal trauma, 9 had tumor, and 10 had infection. Fifteen patients had restrictive lung disease diagnosed by pulmonary function testing (10 children and 5 adults). The thoracoabdominal approach was used in 50 patients, thoracotomy in 22 patients, and the lumbar approach in 10 patients. Two incisions were used in three patients. Correction was accomplished by interbody fusion in 36 patients (17 with instrumentation) and strut graft in 49 patients (6 with instrumentation). Twelve strut grafts were vascularized ribs and 37 were free ribs. Eighty-two patients survived (96 percent). Seventy-four complications occurring in 50 patients all resolved prior to discharge. These included 28 pulmonary complications, 27 urinary complications, and 5 gastrointestinal complications. Three patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation. Solid fusion was seen in 78 of 85 patients, whereas pseudoarthrosis developed in 7.\r"

There were no abnormalities in plasma free, conjugated, or intraplatelet free norepinephrine. All of the levels were independent of the etiology, the duration, and the severity of the disease. The reduced plasma levels of free dopamine and epinephrine might be due to impaired adrenal release in response to some kinds of sympathetic stimulation or to rapid tissue uptake and peripheral metabolism.

At the threshold, we should not dismiss lightly the traditional role of the doctor as the autocrat. There is much to be said in his or her favor: 1. The basic decision, after all, is a medical one--diagnosis and prognosis--with the concurrence perhaps of a consultant or a specialist. That decision was and is a major premise. Miss it and one misses the mark. 2. What is so novel, what is so startling about a fateful life-death issue in the medical profession? It is quotidian. In the Armageddon between human life and human demise, doctors have been making those solemn decisions in other areas of medicine from time immemorial. Often--not always--the patient is silently saying to the doctor, \"My life is in your hands.\" 3. And within what context does he act? Usually--not always--he knows the patient. He knows the family. He knows the surrounding circumstances. But there still lurks that gnawing, underlying flaw. The decision-making is not diffused. The doctor stands alone. Small \"groups\" or \"committees,\" retaining medical guidance, share responsibilities, make more palatable to themselves those agonizing decisions, and contribute to their acceptability by society. Here, then, is the harvest to be reaped by diffusion. What is so striking is that the decision-making process anent life-support systems still calls for a superior breed of men and women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to establish a possible relationship between the early morning dyspnoea and a reduced beta-adrenergic activity, these parameters were measured during the \"morning dip\" in FEV1 and in the afternoon, when lung function is maximal. No differences were observed for lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics (beta-receptor number, Kd, for 3H-dihydroalprenolol, and cAMP response to isoproterenol) between patients and controls, when determined at 8 AM or at 4 PM. Nor was there a significant circadian variation in these parameters present in both groups. By contrast, the patients showed a significantly reduced urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, as measured in four-hourly urine portions collected between 8 and 12 AM and between 4 and 8 PM, respectively. In addition, the urinary excretion of epinephrine showed a significant circadian variation in the patients, which was correlated with the FEV1 (% predicted). Such a relationship was not found for norepinephrine. The results suggest that a (generalized) dysfunction of the beta-adrenergic receptor is not involved in the pathogenesis of CAO or EMD. However, reduced beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation due to decreased levels of catecholamines may contribute to the observed (variation in) airflow obstruction of the patients.\r"

In three food-allergic patients IgG anti-IgE was detectable in a complexed form in the serum samples examined before and after food challenge. The finding of IgG anti-IgE autoantibody in a group of patients with allergic arthralgia is quite exciting. It raises the possibility of distinguishing a subgroup of arthralgic patients not having a classical rheumatoid arthritis, who may have a definable external exacerbating cause for their symptoms.

In a subgroup of 15 patients with undetectable venom-specific IgE, there were 16 re-stings in eight patients, leading to three systemic reactions.

Calcium channel blockers including nifedipine have been shown to inhibit mast cell degranulation in different systems. The oral administration of nifedipine (10 mg) did not affect the size of codeine-induced skin reactions in ten normal volunteers. Mean wheal over flare sizes were 11.7 mm/29.2 mm before nifedipine and 11.5 mm/31.0 mm at peak nifedipine blood levels. Similar observations were made when codeine was injected locally with or without 20 micrograms nifedipine (12.1/29.2 mm and 13.2/29.2 mm, respectively). These data suggest that codeine-induced mast cell degranulation may be mediated by a calcium-independent mechanism. Alternatively, mast cells in the human skin may differ in their reactions to secretagogues when compared with basophils and mast cells from other human tissues or other species.\r"

  ".W": "IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions are characterized by an immediate or early-phase response within the first 30 minutes of exposure to allergen, followed by a late-phase response that begins two to six hours later. Histamine is released during both the early- and late-phase responses and inhibits a variety of neutrophil functions, including superoxide anion generation, chemotaxis, and enzyme secretion. There is some debate as to whether histamine's action on neutrophils is mediated through H1 or H2 receptors, or through a single receptor that recognizes both H1 and H2 agonists. In an effort to understand the mechanism of action of the H1-antagonist cetirizine, we studied its effects on a variety of neutrophil functions. We found that at concentrations up to 35 micrograms/mL), it does not affect superoxide anion production or degranulation. However, at higher concentrations (greater than 35 micrograms/mL), a concentration-dependent inhibition of superoxide anion production is observed. This inhibition is most apparent with responses stimulated by chemotactic factors. Limited inhibition of degranulation and chemotaxis is also seen at high concentrations, but at a level far below that seen with superoxide anion production. These studies indicate that neutrophil function is not altered by the circulating concentrations of cetirizine attained during therapy (less than 10 micrograms/mL), but may be suppressed at higher concentrations. Additional effects of cetirizine on neutrophil function, possible influences of the drug on the inflammatory response, and histamine's modulation of neutrophil function are discussed.\r"

The purpose of the evaluation was to determine whether dosage schedules of cetirizine will require modification in the elderly or patients with renal insufficiency. We found that the elimination half-life of cetirizine was prolonged in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency, compared with age-matched individuals with normal renal function (19.0 +/- 3.3 and 20.9 +/- 4.4 hours, vs 7.4 +/- 3.0 hours, respectively). However, the mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution did not differ significantly between these subject groups (range 0.41 to 0.47 L/kg). Total body clearance and renal clearance of the drug were both significantly lower in the patients with renal insufficiency. In elderly subjects, the elimination half-life of cetirizine was significantly prolonged compared with younger adults, and apparent total body clearance was significantly reduced. Again, there was no significant difference in the volume of distribution between the groups. Linear regression showed good correlations between the disposition characteristics of cetirizine and age as well as creatinine clearance. However, we found no relationship between age and the ratio of apparent total body clearance of cetirizine to creatinine clearance. Thus the disposition of cetirizine is independent of age but dependent on renal function. The relationship between apparent total body clearance of cetirizine and creatinine clearance was significant only in patients with creatinine clearances greater than 40 mL/min. Progressive decrements in creatinine clearance were not associated with similar changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of cetirizine.\r"

Single oral doses of 14C-cetirizine dihydrochloride (10 mg) in aqueous solution were administered to six healthy male volunteers. The drug was rapidly absorbed: The peak mean concentration of radioactivity (359 ng-equivalents/mL) and of unchanged drug (341 ng/mL) were achieved within one hour. Mean concentrations of cetirizine declined biexponentially and had a mean elimination half-life of 7.4 hours. The drug was excreted quite rapidly, with 60% of the dose recovered in the 24-hour urine. An additional 10% was excreted in urine over the next four days. Approximately 10% of the dose was excreted in feces over the five-day study period. The dose was excreted mainly as the unchanged drug. Examination of the radioactive compounds present in the plasma, and excreted in the urine and feces indicate that there is little metabolism of cetirizine. One minor metabolite, formed by oxidative O-dealkylation of the cetirizine side chain, was detected in plasma and feces.\r"

  ".W": "Antihistamines act by competing with histamine for H1 or H2 histamine receptors on cell membranes. In addition, most of the common antihistamines bind other receptors and thus exert other pharmacologic actions. For all practical purposes, mast cells and basophils are the main physiologic sources of histamine, and the primary usefulness of antihistamines is in diseases characterized by excessive production and release of histamine by these two cell types. Experimental models have proven useful for evaluating antihistamine compounds in humans. In these model systems, a test drug may be employed to block one or more of the known effects of exogenously administered histamine or a histamine agonist. Or the release of endogenous histamine may be brought about in a controlled fashion by agents such as allergens, opiates, or compound 48/80, and the drug's effects on this process may then be measured. In the case of the central nervous system, unfortunately, such models are not available and other means of evaluation must be devised. The dose response and duration of action of orally administered antihistamines can be determined in a simple skin model by their blocking of the wheal and erythema (flare) resulting from an intradermal challenge with histamine, an allergen, or compound 48/80. Antihistamines can also be evaluated in urticaria induced by scratching or cold. Itching that commonly follows injection of histamine or an allergen into the skin is also inhibited by this class of drugs. Most of the commonly used antihistamines are effective in these models, which form the basis for evaluating antihistamines in the treatment of skin diseases. In the nose and conjunctiva, other model strategies are used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate this oral drug's efficacy in treating asthma, we examined the bronchodilator effects of 5-, 10-, and 20-mg doses as well as the protective effects of these doses against histamine-provoked bronchospasm. Cetirizine's efficacy was compared with that of a placebo and oral hydroxyzine (25 mg) in 10 patients with mild asthma. The new compound provided significant protection in a dose-dependent manner against histamine-induced bronchospasm. A 25-mg oral dose of hydroxyzine, which is partially metabolized to cetirizine, yielded blood levels of cetirizine comparable to those attained with 5 mg of oral cetirizine. Hydroxyzine 25 mg conferred greater protection against histamine bronchoprovocation than placebo, but it gave less protection than 10- and 20-mg doses of cetirizine. Cetirizine in all doses, as well as hydroxyzine at 25 mg, produced significant bronchodilation. However, the bronchodilator effect of the 25-mg hydroxyzine dose was less than that of cetirizine at 20 mg. In this short-term study, no significant side effects of cetirizine were noted.\r"

After one adaptation night in the lab, the subjects' sleep patterns were recorded from 2300 to 0730 hours. Subjects were in bed during this period. When they awoke at 0730, a test agent was administered according to double-blind technique. Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT: 20-minute opportunities to fall asleep in bed while EEG and eye movements are recorded) were given at two-hour intervals throughout the day, and a 30-minute vigilance performance test was given at 1000 and 1600 hours. Subjects receiving cetirizine in doses of 5 to 20 mg did not differ from placebo controls in any objective or subjective measure of daytime alertness. Subjects receiving hydroxyzine were significantly more sedated and showed slower reaction times than the placebo control group for at least four hours after treatment. Self-rated feelings of sleepiness, impairment, and fatigue did not differ significantly between groups. This suggests that hydroxyzine subjects may not have been aware of their sleepiness and slower reaction times.\r"

In part, this is the result of a lack of objective measures of the nasal response. The purpose of this study was to develop a monkey model for the objective evaluation of antihistamine effectiveness and, using this model, to study the efficacy of cetirizine. Computer-assisted active anterior rhinomanometry was used to assess nasal airway resistance (NAR) before and after a nasal histamine provocation in conscious rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). To establish dose-response relationships for oral antihistamines in monkeys, we measured the suppression of wheal-and-flare reactions by two such agents, oral cetirizine (CET) 0.1 to 1 mg/kg and chlorpheniramine (CHL) 0.07 to 0.2 mg/kg. The decreases in wheal sizes were maximal 60 to 120 minutes after CET 1.0 mg/kg (90%), and after CHL 0.2 mg/kg (70%). The four monkeys were challenged intranasally with increasing histamine doses (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg). The NAR was measured 15 minutes after each dose. At least three days later and 90 minutes after oral pretreatment with either CET 1 mg/kg or CHL 0.2 mg/kg, the intranasal challenges were repeated. Postchallenge NAR data are given as the percent increase from the baseline NAR values. The four monkeys studied had coefficients of variation of 13%, 15%, 16%, and 26% respectively for baseline studies. Mean percent increases in NAR +/- standard deviation were 14% +/- 0.4%, 47% +/- 10.0%, 45% +/- 3.0%, and 72% +/- 6.0% after intranasal challenge with 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg of histamine, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether complement activation accompanied reductions in effective hepatic and renal blood flow (EHBF and ERBF, respectively) in a septic murine model previously demonstrated to be associated with flow redistribution. Rats underwent either cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham laparotomy after a baseline blood sample was collected for complement assay. Eighteen hours later, thermodilution cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, EHBF by galactose clearance, and ERBF by p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance were determined. A second blood sample was collected for measurement of total hemolytic complement (CH50) by immune hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes and was compared to the t = 0 sample for calculation of per cent change in CH50. The cardiac output and hematocrit were normal in the CLP group relative to sham. The septic animals were tachycardic and slightly hypotensive, suggesting a diminished systemic vascular resistance. EHBF and ERBF fell dramatically in the septic group despite the normal cardiac output. Residual hemolytic complement activity was reduced to less than 40% of preseptic levels in the CLP group while sham values were no different than baseline, indicating massive complement activation in the septic animals. This study demonstrates an association between complement activation and hepatic and renal perfusion abnormalities in murine peritonitis. Work is underway to establish the temporal relationship between complement activation and visceral flow changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of macroscopic and microscopic evaluation were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (Newman-Keuls). Damp albuminated grafts had significantly less transinterstitial blood loss than uncoated grafts (P less than 0.05). No significant differences in thrombogenicity, thrombus-free surface area, tissue ingrowth, or endothelial coverage existed between the damp albuminated and the uncoated grafts. However, significantly less thrombogenicity (P less than 0.05) and more endothelial cell coverage (P less than 0.05) were present in the damp albuminated grafts than in the collagen-coated grafts. No evidence for delayed graft hemorrhage or distal embolization was found in any group. The new damp albuminated graft is a minimally thrombogenic prosthesis combining low implantation porosity with relative ease of handling. It should function well as a low porosity graft for great vessel replacement.\r"

A statistically significant (P 0.05) decrease in the incidence of septic death was seen in comparing the total splenectomized animals (63%) to the autotransplant group (27%), the partial splenectomy (4%) and the control group (4%). This diminishing mortality is inversely proportional to the amount of splenic remnant in the respective groups. There was a similar, parallel relationship in the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Thus, the greater the amount of remaining splenic tissue, the lower the incidence of bacteremia and subsequent mortality, implying the preservation of immunologic function with splenic conservation.\r"

Groups were compared to sham-operation and truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty (TVP) regarding gastric acid secretion, plasma gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and histology, including immunocytochemistry for G-cells. All operative procedures reduced acid output (P less than 0.001) both immediately and at 8 weeks, with LCV being more effective than TVP or MA. Moreover, LCV with MA was no more beneficial than LCV alone. Plasma gastrin increased slightly following TVP but not following the LCV group in the acute study, and no difference was seen in the chronic group. Histologically, the depth of laser penetration was optimum with no perforations. Although the G-cells were destroyed following the laser photoradiation, they reappeared in lesser numbers at 8 weeks. Laser photoradiation of the intramural nerve plexuses on the lesser curve of the stomach by intragastric mucosal myotomy is effective in reducing gastric acid and may have a clinical and therapeutic role with flexible fiberoptic gastroscopy.\r"

The authors evaluated the effects of a stable cocarboxylase solution in the treatment of an experimentally created acute myocardial infarction in 14 healthy mongrel dogs. The left anterior descending artery was ligated for 60 minutes and data were collected at the following points: A) prior to ligation, B) 15 minutes after ligation, C) 30 minutes after ligation, and D) 60 minutes after ligation. In one group (Group II), cocarboxylase (150 mgm/kg) was given systematically via a central line 15 minutes and 45 minutes after ligation, while in Group I an equal amount of D5W was given. Hemodynamic data include heart rate, systolic and mean arterial pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, right arterial pressure, and cardiac output. Myocardial O2 consumption was determined by the method of Rooke and Feigl. Electrocardiographic data were also monitored throughout the experiment. In both groups, preligation (point A) hemodynamic data were similar. In Group II, there were beneficial hemodynamic changes versus Group I (expressed as percentage recovery of hemodynamic performance from preligation) at points C and D, with significant (P less than 0.05) decreases in heart rate, increased stroke volume, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased myocardial O2 consumption. EKG criteria also showed improvement in Group II versus Group I. In conclusion, this experiment suggests that cocarboxylase may be beneficial to ischemic canine myocardium by virtue of its favorable systemic hemodynamic effects.\r"

Forty-one patients (34%) showed various arterial anomalies in the peripancreatic and hepatic areas. The most common anomalies included the right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery (16%) and the left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric (11%). Thirty-two of the 120 patients eventually underwent pancreatic resection, and ten of the 32 resected patients (31%) had aberrant arterial anatomy. Recognition of the arterial anomalies permitted resection with no arterial reconstruction in nine of the patients. One patient required sacrifice of an aberrant right hepatic artery that was reconstructed with an anastomosis to the gastroduodenal artery remnant. Selective angiography should be done routinely before any potential radical resection for malignant neoplasms of the pancreas. Recognition of arterial anomalies generally permits satisfactory resection. Even if arterial segments require sacrifice, reconstruction can generally be accomplished with regional vessels, avoiding major arterial grafts.\r"

She had episodes of hematemesis and a prompt diagnosis of early gastric cancer was made following observations using a gastroduodenal fiberscope. A living normal child was delivered following oxytocin-induced labor and, 18 days later, curative resection for the gastric cancer was done. The patient has been doing well for over 16 months at this writing, with no evidence of recurrence.

This study of radial keratotomy complications includes the number of patients and percentage of the total of the following: intraoperative occurrences which generally do not affect vision, which include microperforations and macroperforations; postoperative changes which do not affect vision: limbal \"peeking\" and star pattern with light; transient occurrences which tend to resolve with time: ptosis, recurrent erosions, corneal ulcer, microwound abscess, delayed wound healing, inferior rectus palsy, glare or fluctuating vision after six months, iritis, and stromal keratitis; postoperative changes which can affect vision (correctible): overcorrection more than 1.5 diopters, marked undercorrection more than -2.00 diopters, irregular astigmatism, neovascularization after soft-contact-lens wear, and best-corrected acuity decreased usually only one line; and postoperative changes which can affect vision (uncorrectible): retrobulbar hemorrhage and endophthalmitis, loss of the eye, herpes keratitis, and cataract formation.\r"

We report a bilateral case repaired surgically by a single, whole-muscle, superior rectus transposition. Secondary medial rectus contracture, a common problem, is usually managed by surgical weakening procedures which it is difficult, if not impossible, to grade. We attempted to avoid the problem by weakening the antagonist medial rectus by intraoperative injection of botulinum toxin which might allow a self-adjusting mechanism. Using this approach, fusion in down-gaze without correction and in the primary position with a small amount of vertical and horizontal prism correction was achieved. Good to excellent abduction was restored.\r"

The follow-up period was three to 36 months (average, 1 yr). During this time, 60% to 80% of eyes have maintained an intraocular pressure (IOP) less than 21 mm Hg and/or required less medication. The average IOP reduction was 7.9 mm Hg. Complications included focal, peaking, peripheral anterior synechiae in the lasered area in 19 of 31 eyes (61%), and permanently increased IOP in two of 31 eyes (6%). Gonioplasty was a useful method to differentiate between appositional angle closure and that due to peripheral anterior synechiae. After combined treatment, the chamber angle has remained open for more than a year in 60% to 80% of eyes.\r"

A ring-shaped inlay of biologically-inert polymer is imbedded into the cornea in order to make its curvature steeper. The corneal tissue is displaced centripetally by constant traction around its optical zone. No corneal grafting or incision in the optical zone is required. The simplest way to carry out the procedure is to place a buried intracorneal suture in a circle 6 to 8 mm in diameter. The suture must be tied strongly enough to ensure sufficient bulging of the cornea inside the circle. Then it will remain buried inside the cornea permanently. The term \"circling keratorraphy\" was coined for the technique. The results of the first six procedures performed on patients are presented and are considered to be promising. Some improvements in the exactness and delicacy of the technique are required; this work is currently in progress.\r"

Oral glutamate loading (60 mg of monosodium glutamate per kilogram of body weight, taken orally after overnight fasting) resulted in significantly greater elevations in the plasma glutamate and aspartate levels in the ALS patients than in the controls. Glutamate, a potentially neuroexcitotoxic compound, is thought to be the transmitter of the corticospinal tracts and certain spinal cord interneurons.

Seven of nine (78%) patients with chronic Wernicke's encephalopathy had smaller mamillary bodies than 36 of 37 control patients and 7 of 7 Alzheimer patients. The decrease in mamillary body volume was related neither to patient age nor to degree of ventricular enlargement, and most likely reflects the mamillary body atrophy that is grossly apparent at autopsy in up to 81% of Wernicke patients. This technique provides a means of identifying the most specific macroscopic lesion of chronic Wernicke's encephalopathy.\r"

Incidence of familial clustering of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy was about 20%. Type C retrovirus was isolated from cultured cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood lymphocytes in both cases. Modes of transmission seem to be similar to those described in ATLL, although there are no reports of both HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and ATLL occurring in the same family. We suggest three possibilities: (1) that the virus associated with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy is different from the virus causing ATLL, although they seem to be morphologically and immunologically similar; (2) that HTLV-I-associated myelopathy may be determined by the ATLL-causing virus plus a specific genetic background; and (3) some combination of factors 1 and 2.\r"

PTZ seizures were prevented by GVG injections in the anterior thalamus, the caudal hypothalamus, the superior colliculus, cerebellar nuclei, and in a large area of the medial medullary, pontine, and mesencephalic tegmentum encompassing the vestibular nuclei, the reticular formation, and portions of the central gray. GVG injections in the substantia nigra did not protect against PTZ seizures. In contrast, tonic hindlimb extension in MES was prevented consistently by injections in the substantia nigra. A minority of injections in the vestibular nuclei, cerebellar nuclei, and parts of the reticular formation also protected against tonic hindlimb extension of MES. These results indicate a striking difference in the functional anatomy of PTZ-induced seizures and MES. PTZ seizures appear to be mediated by an extensive system involving the reticular formation, diencephalic regions in the vicinity of the anterior medial thalamus and caudal hypothalamus, and bulbar regions which give rise to descending motor pathways to the spinal cord. In contrast to PTZ seizures, MES appears to be mediated by a different neuroanatomical substrate with the present data implicating only the substantia nigra definitely in that process.\r"

Cerebral blood flow increased and remained elevated in all animals subjected to seizure, regardless of blood or brain glucose concentration. In vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy disclosed a small (10-20%) decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels and a greater (20-40%) decline in phosphocreatine levels in animals experiencing seizure, irrespective of whether they were hyper-, normo-, or hypoglycemic. In vitro analysis of brain extracts with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy disclosed a significant elevation of lactate in all seizing animals. There were differences in brain alanine, glycine, and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels between the hyperglycemia-seizure and hypoglycemia-seizure groups. Alternate substrates such as lactate, fatty acids, or amino acids may be used when neonatal seizure is complicated by hypoglycemia, thereby preventing further deterioration of brain metabolic state.\r"
