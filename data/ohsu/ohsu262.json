Cells were incubated at 37 degrees C with [3H]oleate bound to albumin in various molar ratios and the initial rate of uptake (V0) was determined as a function of the unbound oleate concentration in the medium. V0 was saturable with increasing oleate concentrations incubated (Km 78 nM; Vmax 1.9 nmol X min-1 per 10(6) cells) and temperature dependent with an optimum at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, binding of [3H]oleate to isolated plasma membranes of cardiomyocytes was saturable, revealing a KD of 42 nM, and was inhibited by heat denaturation or trypsin pretreatment of the membranes. From these membranes a single 40-kD protein with high affinity for a variety of long chain fatty acids was isolated. With a monospecific antibody to this membrane protein, binding as well as cellular influx of [3H]oleate was selectively inhibited. These data indicate that at least a portion of myocardial fatty acid uptake is mediated by a specific membrane protein.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase, which conjugates LTA4 and LTA4-methyl ester (LTA4-me) with glutathione (GSH) to form LTC4 and LTC4-me, respectively, has been solubilized from the microsomes of guinea pig lung and purified 91-fold in four steps to a specific activity of 692 nmol/10 min per mg protein using LTA4-me as substrate. LTC4 synthase of guinea pig lung was separated from microsomal GSH S-transferase by Sepharose CL-4B chromatography and further purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, agarose-butylamine chromatography, and DEAE-3SW fast-protein liquid chromatography. It was also differentiated from the microsomal GSH S-transferase, which utilized 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as a substrate, by its heat lability and relative resistance to inhibition by S-hexyl-GSH. The Km value of guinea pig lung LTC4 synthase for LTA4 was 3 microM and the Vmax was 108 nmol/3 min per microgram; the Km values for LTA3 and LTA5 were similar, and the Vmax values were about one-half those obtained with LTA4. The conversion of LTA4-me to LTC4-me was competitively inhibited by LTA3, LTA4, and LTA5, with respective Ki values of 1.5, 3.3, and 2.8 microM, suggesting that these substrates were recognized by a common active site. IC50 values for the inhibition of the conjugation of 20 microM LTA4-me with 5 mM GSH were 2.1 microM and 0.3 microM for LTC4 and LTC3, respectively. In contrast, LTD4 was substantially less inhibitory (IC50 greater than 40 microM), and LTE4 and LTB4 had no effect on the enzyme, indicating that the mixed type product inhibition observed was specific for sulfidopeptide leukotrienes bearing the GSH moiety.\r"

  ".U": "88139792\r", 
  ".W": "The pathway for hepatic glycogen synthesis in the postprandial state was studied in meal-fed rats chronically cannulated in the portal vein. Plasma glucose concentration in the portal vein was found to be 4.50 +/- 1.01 mM (mean +/- SE; n = 3) before a meal and 11.54 +/- 0.70 mM (mean +/- SE; n = 4) after a meal in rats meal-fed a diet consisting of 100% commercial rat chow for 7 d. The hepatic-portal difference of plasma glucose concentration showed that liver released glucose in the fasted state and either extracted or released glucose after feeding depending on plasma glucose concentration in the portal vein. The concentration of portal vein glucose at which liver changes from glucose releasing to glucose uptake was 8 mM, the Km of glucokinase [E.C. 2.7.1.12]. The rate of glycogen synthesis in liver during meal-feeding was found to be approximately 1 mumol glucosyl U/g wet wt/min in rats meal-fed a 50% glucose supplemented chow diet. The relative importance of the direct vs. indirect pathway for the replenishment of hepatic glycogen was determined by the incorporation of [3-3H,U-14C]glucose into liver glycogen. Labeled glucose was injected into the portal vein at the end of meal-feeding. The ratio of 3H/14C in the glucosyl units of glycogen was found to be 83-92% of the ratio in liver free glucose six minutes after the injection, indicating that the majority of exogenous glucose incorporated into glycogen did not go through glycolysis. The percent contribution of the direct versus indirect pathway was quantitated from the difference in the relative specific activity (RSA) of [3H] and [14C]-glycogen in rats infused with [3-3H,U-14C]glucose. No significant difference was found between the RSA of [3H]glycogen and [14C]glycogen, indicating further that the pathway for glycogen synthesis in liver from exogenous glucose is from the direct pathway. Our results do not support the thesis that the majority of liver glycogen is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate derived from gluconeogenesis. Reasons for the discrepancy between current findings and other reports supporting the indirect pathway for glycogen synthesis in the liver are discussed.\r"

Using the functioning rat thyroid line (FRTL5) cells for TGI (incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA) and TSAb (increase in cAMP concentration) assays, we tested IgG from 30 Graves' patients. Positive TGI assay occurred only if cAMP increased in the cells and responses correlated, i.e., r = 0.95, P less than 0.001. With one very potent TSAb-IgG we showed that Fab was active as TGI and TSAb, IgG with pI of 8.5-9.0 was the most potent fraction in both systems and an inhibitory IgG prevented the action of both TSAb-IgG and TSH in both the TSAb and TGI assays. In the last example, the action was on the cell membrane and not on the TSH or IgG. These data are entirely compatible with the view that in Graves' disease, at least as tested in FRTL5 cells, the same IgG is active in stimulating both growth and adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in fibroblasts from 132 subjects with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-LDL receptor monoclonal antibody. 16 of the 132 cell strains (12%) synthesized no immunodetectable LDL receptor protein, indicating the presence of two mutant genes that failed to produce cross-reacting material (crm- mutations). DNA and mRNA from 15 of the 16 crm- patients, representing 30 crm- genes, were available for further study. Haplotype analysis based on 10 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) suggested that the 30 crm- genes represent 13 mutant alleles. Four of the alleles produced no mRNA. Three of these four mRNA- alleles had large deletions ranging from 6 to 20 kb that eliminated the promoter region of the gene. The fourth mRNA- allele did not contain any deletion or alteration in the promoter sequence; the reason for the mRNA- phenotype was not apparent. Nine alleles were positive for mRNAs, of which three encoded mRNAs of abnormal size. One of the abnormal mRNAs was produced by a gene harboring a deletion, and another was produced by a gene with a complex rearrangement. The third abnormal-sized mRNA (3.1 kb larger than normal) was produced by an allele that had no detectable alterations as judged by Southern blotting. The other six mRNA+ alleles appeared normal by Southern blotting and produced normal-sized mRNA but no receptor protein. The current studies demonstrate that mRNA analysis coupled with haplotype determination by Southern blot analysis can be used to classify crm- mutations at a genetic locus where multiple alleles exist.\r"

Lymphoid cells accumulate in the islets of Langerhans and beta cells undergo destruction. We report that inoculation of such BB rats with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Armstrong strain, clone 13) reduces over a prolonged period the incidence of IDDM, normalizes the concentration of blood sugar and pancreatic insulin, prevents the mononuclear cell infiltration in the islets of Langerhans, and for a short time after inoculation alters T lymphocyte subsets. Thus, a virus might be programmed to carry out useful functions.\r"

  ".W": "A synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 34 amino acids of the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) produced by a human tumor associated with hypercalcemia was examined for skeletal and renal effects on calcium metabolism in vivo and in vitro. These effects were compared with those of human parathyroid hormone (1-34), hPTH (1-34). Equal doses of PTH-rP(1-34) and hPTH(1-34) produced equivalent stimulation of adenylate cyclase in vitro in bone cells and kidney cells and tubules. Subcutaneous injection of PTH-rP(1-34) in mice caused a significant dose-related increase in blood ionized calcium similar to that seen with hPTH(1-34) at equivalent doses. Repeated injections of equal doses of both peptides caused sustained hypercalcemia which was significantly greater in PTH-rP(1-34)-treated mice, although each induced comparable increases in histomorphometric indices of osteoclastic bone resorption. PTH-rP(1-34) and hPTH(1-34) also caused similar increases in bone resorption when incubated with fetal rat long bones in organ culture. Infusion of either peptide into thyroparathyroidectomized rats suppressed urinary calcium excretion and increased urinary excretion of cyclic AMP. PTH-rP appears to have similar effects to those of PTH on the skeleton, the kidney, and overall calcium homeostasis.\r"

In previous reports, analysis of the kinetic properties of APRT from APRT-deficient Japanese subjects revealed strikingly similar abnormalities suggesting a distinct \"Japanese-type\" mutation. In this paper, we report studies of 11 APRT-deficient lymphoblast cell lines. Nucleotide sequence analysis of APRT genomic DNA from WR2, a Japanese-type homozygote, identified a T to C substitution in exon 5, giving rise to the substitution of threonine for methionine at position 136. RNase mapping analysis confirmed this mutation in WR2 and revealed that six other Japanese-type homozygotes carry the same mutation on at least one allele. The remaining Japanese subject, who does not express the Japanese-type phenotype, did not demonstrate this mutation. Southern blot analysis showed that all seven Japanese-type subjects were confined to one TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotype. These studies provide direct evidence for the nature of the mutation in the Japanese-type APRT deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral lymphocytes of 50 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (13 of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 17 of AIDS related complex (ARC), and 20 healthy carriers) were studied immunoultrastructurally. The prevalence of \"tubuloreticular structures\" and \"tubular confronting cisternae\" increased with the progression of the disease. Numerous tubular confronting cisternae were noted in patients presenting with a high serum acid labile alpha-interferon values. The patients with depressed natural killer cell activity were characterised by circulating immature natural killer cells with abundant multivesicular bodies that were devoid of \"parallel tubular arrays\". With an immunogold staining technique the location of HIV antigen was detected ultrastructurally, both at the surface of \"hand-mirror\" natural killer cell lymphocytes and inside vacuolised cells, probably corresponding to infected T4 lymphocytes. These findings indicate the usefulness of electron microscopic techniques in evaluating the pathology and the pathogenetic outcome of AIDS.\r"

Discriminant analysis was applied to multiple variables based on the measurements, and three variables were identified as of high predictive value. The most powerful discriminant was increased lamina propria cellularity in all forms of chronic colitis. The ratios of surface length to mucosal length and of surface epithelial height to crypt epithelial height also emerged as discriminants. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease was distinguished from normal in 95% of cases with a definite pathological diagnosis, and 85% of borderline cases were correctly classified as either normal or inflammatory when judged by the final diagnosis after follow up. This study provides a basis for automated diagnosis of rectal biopsy specimens and provides objectively validated criteria which can also be applied in routine histological diagnosis.\r"

Therefore, clinical variables and in-hospital and 1 year mortality rates were analyzed in 2,088 patients, aged 18 to 95 years (mean +/- SD 64 +/- 12), admitted to the hospital with acute myocardial infarction between 1979 and mid 1984. One hundred forty-seven patients (7%) had at least one episode of ventricular fibrillation occurring within 48 h of hospital admission. Of these, 25% died during their initial hospitalization compared with 13% of patients without early ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.001). In greater than 50% of patients with early ventricular fibrillation, the immediate cause of death was left ventricular failure or cardiogenic shock. In contrast, the 1 year mortality rate after hospital discharge was not significantly greater in patients with than in those without early ventricular fibrillation (15 versus 11%, respectively), particularly in the subgroup of patients with anterior myocardial infarction in which the mortality rate tended to be lower in patients with early ventricular fibrillation (8 versus 14%, respectively). Similar mortality results were found when only primary (not associated with left ventricular failure) ventricular fibrillation was analyzed. The left ventricular ejection fraction and the incidence of complex ventricular arrhythmias from 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring obtained at hospital discharge were not different in survivors with or without early ventricular fibrillation (0.45 +/- 0.13 versus 0.49 +/- 0.14 and 41 versus 41%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 17 of these patients there was a persistent release of myosin light chains lasting until the 4th hospital day, whereas in 7 patients myosin light chains were only detectable during the initial 24 h after admission. The presence of myosin light chains correlated with signs of ischemia in the electrocardiogram (ECG) (p less than 0.05) and with the extent of coronary artery narrowing (p less than 0.05). Cardiac myosin light chains were elevated in serum only if there was a greater than or equal to 75% diameter narrowing in at least one major vessel. In all five patients who developed transmural myocardial infarction during the course of their hospital stay, myosin light chains were detectable greater than or equal to 28 h before the diagnosis of myocardial infarction could be established by ECG criteria and conventional serum enzymes. Thus the detection of circulating cardiac myosin light chains enables one to identify a subgroup of patients with angina at rest having more severe coronary artery disease with a worse outcome.\r"

All participants then underwent same day graded bicycle exercise, with simultaneous radionuclide angiography in both the upright and the supine posture. Catecholamines were measured, and a variety of volumetric and hemodynamic data were obtained. Group I (patients with mitral valve prolapse) demonstrated a reduced exercise tolerance, especially during upright exercise, as measured by both total exercise duration and maximal work load achieved. Mean total catecholamine measurements were similar between the two study groups at comparable mean heart rate, mean blood pressure and mean rate-pressure (double) product. No difference was observed in the ratio of right to left ventricular stroke counts at rest or during exercise regardless of posture, suggesting that exercise-induced mitral regurgitation did not occur. A difference was noted, however, in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index. At rest, Group I patients exhibited a 42% decrease in this index when sitting upright, and this difference from supine values persisted at submaximal (300 kpm/min) and peak work loads (34 and 29% difference, respectively). This contrasted with the control subjects whose upright end-diastolic volumes at rest, at 300 kpm/min and at peak exercise were reduced 21, 10 and 3%, respectively, compared with supine values. Cardiac index measurements reflected the reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the response of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation to exercise, 50 men (mean age 65 +/- 8 years) with atrial fibrillation underwent a maximal exercise test using respiratory gas exchange techniques. Patients were classified by the presence (n = 29) or absence (\"lone atrial fibrillation,\" n = 21) of underlying heart disease. Responses were evaluated at a standard submaximal work load (3.0 mph, [4.8 km/h] 0% grade), at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold and at maximal exercise. For all 50 patients, the mean maximal oxygen uptake was 20.6 ml/kg per min, which approximates 85% of the aerobic capacity predicted for age-matched normal individuals. Patients with lone atrial fibrillation demonstrated normal exercise capacity in contrast to patients with atrial fibrillation and known heart disease (22.7 +/- 5 versus 19.1 +/- 5.0 ml/kg per min, p less than 0.05). The mean maximal heart rate (176 +/- 30 beats/min) was approximately 20 beats/min higher than that expected for age, was extremely variable and accounted for only 8% of the variance in maximal oxygen uptake. Maximal heart rate in subjects with lone atrial fibrillation was higher than that of subjects with atrial fibrillation and known heart disease (189 +/- 32 versus 166 +/- 24 beats/min, p less than 0.01). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that maximal systolic blood pressure accounted for 19% of the variance in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), suggesting that systolic function is an important determinant of exercise performance in atrial fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the possibility of terminating reciprocating atrioventricular (AV) tachycardia using subthreshold atrial pacing. Ten patients with a left-sided accessory pathway and sustained AV tachycardia underwent subthreshold atrial pacing from the coronary sinus site closest to insertion of the accessory pathway. In seven of these patients, the tachycardia could be reliably terminated with subthreshold atrial overdrive pacing. When pacing at a cycle length of 80 +/- 23% of the tachycardia cycle length, the minimal subthreshold current that was effective in tachycardia termination was 64 +/- 14% of threshold current and the maximal ineffective current was 49 +/- 17% of threshold (p less than 0.05). In all cases, the tachycardia was terminated by one or two instances of atrial capture that resulted in a premature atrial impulse (20 +/- 4% advancement of the atrial cycle) that blocked the AV node limb of the tachycardia. Anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway never occurred, either during the tachycardia or during subthreshold pacing after a return to normal sinus rhythm. No instances of atrial fibrillation were provoked by subthreshold pacing. Possible explanations for the intermittent atrial capture with critically placed subthreshold impulses include supernormal atrial conduction or summation of impulses at the atrial insertion site of the accessory pathway. It is concluded that subthreshold pacing is effective in selected patients with AV tachycardia due to an accessory pathway. Furthermore, because neither atrial fibrillation nor anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway is seen with subthreshold pacing, this modality may hold significant promise for permanent antitachycardia pacing in these patients.\r"

To determine if programmed electrical stimulation at the recording site can assist in localizing areas of slow conduction that are participating in the tachycardia circuit, seven patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia were studied. The cardiac cycle was scanned with single stimuli delivered during ventricular tachycardia at multiple endocardial sites. In four patients, an endocardial site was identified at which stimuli advanced the tachycardia with marked conduction delay and without alteration of the ventricular activation sequence, as indicated by a lack of change in the configuration of the QRS complex and endocardial electrograms distant from the stimulation site. This finding was seen only during stimulation at sites displaying abnormal electrograms and is consistent with premature depolarization of an area of slow conduction within the tachycardia focus by stimuli delivered at or near that area. Attempted endocardial catheter ablation at or adjacent to these sites in three patients was followed by persistent noninducibility of ventricular tachycardia in one patient, marked modification of the configuration and cycle length of inducible tachycardia in one patient and transient noninducibility of tachycardia in one patient. Programmed electrical stimulation during ventricular tachycardia at sites with abnormal electrograms may provide information about the proximity of the stimulation site to the tachycardia circuit.\r"

In all patients, electrodes for pacing and recording were placed in both the left and right ventricles during electrophysiologic study. Among the 19 patients in whom the response to rapid pacing could be evaluated (25 episodes of ventricular tachycardia), transient entrainment was demonstrated in 79% (76% of episodes). Ten of 12 episodes of ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block QRS configuration in lead V1 and 9 of 13 episodes with a right bundle branch block QRS configuration could be transiently entrained (p = NS). Transient entrainment was demonstrated for 8 of 11 episodes of ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block configuration during pacing from the left ventricle, but for only 2 of 10 episodes during pacing from the right ventricular apex (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of myocardial scintigraphy with nitrogen-13 (N-13) glutamate as a marker of myocardial metabolism. Within 2 weeks after cardiac catheterization, 25 patients with single vessel left anterior descending coronary artery disease underwent thallium-201 imaging (5 min and 3 h after injection) and N-13 glutamate scintigraphy (10 min after injection). Radionuclide studies were performed in the 30 degrees left anterior oblique projection after symptom-limited bicycle exercise, and regional tracer uptake was quantified by computer-assisted placement of regions of interest within the regions of myocardial activity. Poststenotic tracer uptake in the perfusion bed of the left anterior descending coronary artery (septum) was then normalized to the tracer uptake in the nondiseased left circumflex territory (posterolateral segments = 100%). In 14 patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction (Subgroup A), deficient poststenotic N-13 uptake correlated closely with thallium-201 uptake in both initial (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001) and redistribution (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01) scintigrams. By contrast, in 11 patients with no previous myocardial infarction and normal left ventricular function at rest (Subgroup B), initial uptake of both tracers was inverse: poststenotic N-13 glutamate uptake increased with decreasing thallium-201 uptake during exercise-induced ischemia (r = -0.64, p less than 0.05) and was closely correlated with the percent thallium-201 redistribution (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01). Thus, augmented accumulation of N-13 glutamate in reversibly ischemic (that is, viable) myocardium, and decreased uptake in myocardial scar tissue suggest the clinical usefulness of this metabolic tracer in the differentiation between viable (metabolically active) and irreversibly damaged myocardium.\r"

An electronic pressure gauge was built and tested for measurement of inspiratory pressures during two-dimensional echocardiography to quantitate the diameter of the inferior vena cava. Thirty-one studies were made in 27 alert, informed, consenting patients with an in-place pulmonary artery catheter having right atrial ports. Inferior vena cava diameter was measured in successive 10 mm segments distal to the right atrial-inferior vena cava junction on images obtained while the patient suspended breathing at full inspiration and during each 4 mm Hg increment of a calibrated inspiratory maneuver. Results show that the segment between 5 and 30 mm distal to the right atrial-inferior vena cava junction was the region most responsive to increasing inspiratory pressure. In this segment, the inspiratory pressure required to decrease the inferior vena cava diameter to greater than or equal to 85% of the difference between its maximal (suspended full inspiration) and minimal (over the entire inspiratory maneuver) values was similar or equal to the mean right atrial pressure (measured from the pulmonary artery catheter) (r = 0.87, SEE = 2.9 mm Hg). Minimal inferior vena cava diameter was directly related to mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.56); the minimal to maximal inferior vena cava diameter ratio was inversely related to mean right atrial pressure (r = -0.57). Maximal inferior vena cava diameter and the absolute (measured) amount of inferior vena cava diameter decrease correlated weakly with mean right atrial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To further assess the respiratory changes in transvalvular blood flow during tamponade, pulsed Doppler tracings of flow velocity profiles across all four cardiac valves were recorded during inspiration and expiration in 13 patients during cardiac tamponade, in 6 of the 13 patients after relief of tamponade by pericardiocentesis and in 8 normal control subjects. Flow velocity integrals were calculated for each valve during inspiration and expiration. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, inspiration caused an 85 +/- 46% increase in the flow velocity integral across the pulmonary valve, an 81 +/- 34% increase across the tricuspid valve, a 33 +/- 13% decrease across the aortic valve and a 35 +/- 8% decrease across the mitral valve. These phasic respiratory changes were markedly reduced after relief of tamponade (p less than 0.05 compared with tamponade) and were observed to only a minimal extent in the normal individuals (p less than 0.01 compared with tamponade). The exaggerated respiratory variations in transvalvular flow velocity integrals suggest that Doppler evaluation may be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Transmitral Doppler indexes of left ventricular filling during cardiac tamponade revealed that inspiration caused a shift to increased filling during late diastole, with a greater contribution of atrial systole to total left ventricular filling. These Doppler indexes did not vary significantly with respiration in the group studied after relief of tamponade or in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess interobserver variability, the largest definable mitral regurgitant jets from three cardiac cycles were independently chosen and measured by planimetry by two observers who were unaware of other patient information. Measurements were repeated by both observers at a separate time to obtain intraobserver data. Videotapes from 23 patients with aortic regurgitation were similarly analyzed. Each observer measured the isovolumic aortic jet (before mitral valve opening) and the maximal aortic regurgitant jet (at any time during diastole) using computer-assisted planimetry. Both intraobserver and interobserver correlations were excellent for mitral regurgitant jet areas (r = 0.97 and r = 0.93, respectively). The intraobserver correlation for isovolumic aortic regurgitant jet was r = 0.73; the interobserver correlation for this measurement was only fair (r = 0.57). For the maximal aortic regurgitant jet area, intraobserver correlation was good (r = 0.86) and interobserver correlation was fair (r = 0.72). These findings suggest that intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility are acceptable for the measurement of mitral regurgitant jet area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a potentially useful diagnostic test to determine presence and severity of coronary disease; however, the safety of the procedure has not been determined in an older population. The side effect profile and frequency of severe ischemic responses after 0.56 mg/kg of intravenous dipyridamole were compared in 101 patients greater than or equal to 70 years old and 236 patients less than 70 years old. There were no side effects in 64% and 62% of patients greater than or equal to 70 and less than 70 years old, respectively (p = NS). Among the 337 patients tested, there were no complications of myocardial infarction or death. The most common cardiac side effect was chest pain, which occurred in 21 (21%) of the 101 patients aged greater than or equal to 70 years and in 64 (27%) of the 236 patients less than 70 years (p = NS). Aminophylline was required to reverse cardiac or noncardiac side effects in 15 (15%) and 36 (15%) of the patients greater than or equal to 70 and less than 70 years old, respectively (p = NS). A severe ischemic response occurred in 2% and 2.5% of patients greater than or equal to 70 and less than 70 years old, respectively (p = NS). The sensitivity of intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging for obstructive coronary artery disease was 86% (25 of 29) and 83% (68 of 82) in older and younger patients, respectively (p = NS); the specificity was 75% (6 of 8) and 70% (16 of 23), respectively (p = NS). Thus, intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a safe noninvasive method for assessment of older patients with obstructive coronary disease; its side effect profile and diagnostic accuracy are similar to those seen in younger patients. The technique is associated with severe ischemic responses in only a small minority of patients.\r"

The minimal energy necessary for defibrillation (defibrillation threshold) was determined intraoperatively in 21 volunteer patients undergoing accessory pathway ablation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Selection of the use of a single or sequential pulse technique for the initial attempt was randomized. Defibrillation thresholds were determined in three groups of patients: 1) those with four small mesh electrodes (6 cm2), 2) those with two small and two large (13 cm2) mesh electrodes, and 3) those with four large mesh electrodes.

Segments of ventricular fibrillation (n = 102) were categorized by average peak amplitude as fine (1 to less than 3 mm), medium (3 to less than 7 mm), coarse (7 to less than 12 mm) and extra coarse (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and transcribed onto high fidelity videocassette tapes. Nonventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest rhythms (n = 144), which included wide complex idioventricular rhythms, ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias, asystole and artifact, were also transcribed. Automatic external defibrillators developed by three manufacturers reached a treat (shock) decision on 88 to 93% of the ventricular fibrillation rhythms and on 5 to 10% of the nonventricular fibrillation rhythms. The latter decisions were defined as false positive, though for many rapid nonventricular fibrillation rhythms, countershock may be the appropriate treatment response. There were no statistically significant differences among the three devices in the shock/no shock decisions. A variety of ventricular fibrillation arrhythmias and terminology to express the preclinical performance of automatic external defibrillators are defined. Three commercially available automatic external defibrillators appear to successfully identify ventricular fibrillation and nonventricular fibrillation rhythms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subsequently, 24 of the dogs underwent experimental myocardial infarction with permanent left anterior descending coronary ligation, and 13 dogs served as sham-operated controls. Two weeks later, an open chest programmed electrical stimulation was performed in the 13 sham-operated and 24 postinfarction dogs to determine its accuracy in predicting the ventricular arrhythmias that develop during a subsequent episode of acute reversible ischemia. After programmed electrical stimulation, the left circumflex marginal branch was reversibly occluded for 10 min at the same site. The incidence of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during reversible left circumflex marginal coronary occlusion did not differ from the first to the second study in sham-operated dogs, whereas in the postinfarction dogs, it increased from 13% before infarction to 54% after infarction (p = 0.005). The outcome of programmed electrical stimulation predicted spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias during coronary occlusion in only 21% of the postinfarction dogs. The accuracy of programmed electrical stimulation was 42% and its predictive value was 47% in detecting the dogs with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. Regional myocardial blood flow measurements by microsphere technique identified the severity of reversible ischemia in the infarct border and periinfarction zones as a correlate of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during coronary occlusion. In contrast, total infarct size correlated with electrically induced but not with spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

In left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with heart failure these receptors may be impaired or absent, leading to decreased vasopressin release.

Diagnosis is often missed when based solely on physical examination and noninvasive methods. A 4 year old patient is presented in whom mitral regurgitation was noted by a referring physician and an anomalous left coronary artery was found by Doppler color flow mapping upon referral and verified at cardiac catheterization. Doppler color flow mapping was also used intraoperatively using a gas-sterilized transducer to further clarify the hemodynamics and assess the surgical result. After creation of an intrapulmonary artery tunnel from the ostium of the left coronary artery to the aorta, anterograde coronary artery flow and absence of a residual left to right pulmonary artery shunt were verified during surgery by Doppler flow mapping. Postoperatively, residual mitral regurgitation and patency of the left coronary artery graft have been followed up serially by Doppler flow mapping. Therefore, Doppler color flow mapping is useful in the diagnosis and intraoperative and postoperative management of this important and potentially life-threatening abnormality.\r"

Membrane-associated TNF did not behave as an integral protein as it could be eluted from the plasma membranes by either high salt or low pH treatment. Plasma membranes cleared of membrane-associated TNF by high salt treatment were able to bind TNF, and this binding was specifically inhibited by preincubation of rTNF with specific anti-TNF serum. Western blot analysis of plasma membranes showed a membrane-associated TNF with a m. w. of approximately 17 kDa present only in the activated monocytes. When the plasma membranes were preincubated with the cross-linker agent dissuccinimidyl suberate, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a TNF-binding protein with a Mr of approximately 102 kDa. These studies indicate that unlike IL-1, membrane-associated TNF is not an integral membrane protein and that TNF may be associated with the monocyte membrane by occupying the TNF R.\r"

The gp98 molecule was biochemically analyzed to identify a basis for the serologically detected polymorphism. The molecule was demonstrated to be a glycoprotein containing N-linked oligosaccharides. The strain 2 serologic variant, gp98-2, migrated with an apparent m.w. approximately 2500 more than did the strain 13 variant gp98-13. This differential migration was observed in a (strain 2 X strain 13) F1 animal, and persisted after neuraminidase and endoglycosidase F treatment, and after reduction. Trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C digestion localized the biochemical basis of the polymorphism to the peptide portion of the molecule. Biochemical analysis of the gp98 molecules from five different inbred strains indicated that only two biochemical variants correlating with the serologic variants existed among the five strains.\r"

The cryoglobulin Ger manifested values outside the range encountered for the other proteins. The partitioning of the IgG proteins was also examined in aqueous polyethylene glycol-dextran two-phase systems in the presence of both positive and negative salt-induced electrostatic potentials across the phase interface. Both cryoglobulins were found to behave as if they were more negatively charged than the noncryoglobulins. The experiments support the hypothesis that the differences in solubility behavior of monoclonal cryoglobulin and noncryoglobulin proteins are caused by differences in the electrostatic properties of the proteins.\r"

Certain strains of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium perfringens were found to bind a major fraction of polyclonal IgM. One bacterial strain showed a particularly high binding capacity and was studied in more detail. This strain is also able to bind a minor fraction of polyclonal IgA and IgG. Inhibition experiments indicate that the different Ig classes bind to one and the same R structure. The ability of the strain to bind polyclonal Ig is correlated to the number of subunits in the Ig. This correlation can most simply be explained by increasing avidity with increasing number of subunits. In agreement with this hypotheses, experiments with aggregated IgG show that binding ability increases with aggregate size. Experiments with Ig fragments indicate that the binding structure in Ig is located in the F(ab')2 region. The ability of this bacterial strain to bind a majority of IgM molecules as well as aggregated IgG is potentially useful in immunologic work and represents a new type of Ig binding to bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Immune adherence is the attachment of C-bearing immune complexes via the major activation fragment of the third component of C(C3b) to C3b binding membrane proteins. On primate E, the C3b-R, termed CR1, mediates immune adherence. In nonprimates, immune adherence involves platelets instead of E. However, these functional data have not been corroborated by the identification of the binding protein. In this work, we have identified a C3b/iC3 binding protein of rabbit platelets and characterized it as a single chain structure with a Mr of 150 kDa (nonreducing) or 175 kDa (reducing). This protein binds to rabbit iC3 or C3b but not C3d. This specificity of binding and the ability to rebind to a second column of iC3- or C3b-thiol-Sepharose are comparable to human CR1. Also, a molecule with the identical Mr as well as other structural and binding characteristics is present on rabbit PBMC. No such protein was isolated from rabbit E. Our data strongly suggest that the C3b/iC3 binding protein of rabbit platelets is the homologue of human CR1. If so, this represents an interesting evolutionary switch in the tissue specific expression of the immune adherence R from platelets in the nonprimate to E in the primate.\r"

C3 molecules were detectable on the cell surfaces up to 24 h after serum exposure. The C3 fragment-coated cells showed increased sensitivity to spontaneous lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. The effector lymphocytes involved in the enhanced cytotoxicity were NK cells with low buoyant density, carrying both CR3 and FcR. Blocking of the FcR and CR3 with F(ab)2 fragments from Leu-11c or Leu-15 mAb, respectively, did not influence the lysis of targets that did not carry C3 fragments. In contrast, the accessibility of CR3 on the effector lymphocytes was essential for the C3 fragment-mediated enhancement of cytotoxicity. In addition to the Leu-15 antibody, N-acetyl-D-Glucosamine, a compound known to block iC3b binding to CR3, also abrogated the C3 fragment-imposed effect. Our previous experiments showed that the C3 fragments bind to acceptor sites on target cells. The present experiments show that the C3 fragments fixed onto the target bind to CR3 on effector cells. These data substantiate the hypothesis that the bivalent C3 fragments, which are fixed on the targets, promote their interaction with lytic lymphocytes by bridging the two cells.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage adhesion molecule is a surface molecule of guinea pig macrophages and neutrophils. It is the counterpart of mouse Mac-1 and human CD11b/CD18 (Mol/OKM-1/Mac-1/Leu-CAM) and is member of a family of heterodimer glycoproteins with a common beta-subunit. Macrophage adhesion molecule is a prevalent molecule in nonactivated macrophages, but it is dramatically decreased in macrophages activated in vivo. The experimental system of activated vs nonactivated guinea pig peritoneal macrophages was used to examine the mechanisms that down-regulate synthesis of this heterodimer molecule. [35S]Methionine labeling of nonactivated macrophages and chase incubation revealed that synthesis involves separate translation of the alpha- and beta-glycopeptides of \"high mannose\"-containing monomeric precursors, then refolding/assembly to form a heterodimer, and, finally, a maturation process that includes conversion of carbohydrate to \"complex\" units. Two lines of evidence demonstrate that down-regulation in activated macrophages occurs via restriction of the alpha-species. First, pre-beta is detected at 3 h only in activated macrophages. Second, the amount of newly translated pre-alpha averaged 16% in activated macrophages relative to nonactivated macrophages, which is close to the value of 12% for the mature heterodimer. The amount of newly translated pre-beta averaged 62%. These findings identify the regulatory step as a restriction of the alpha-species at, or before, translation. A model is proposed to explain regulation of synthesis of heterodimer membrane glycoproteins.\r"

In sterile meningitis induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (fMLP), low and high doses of fMLP were equally effective in inducing CSF pleocytosis, whereas only high doses of fMLP caused brain edema. High doses of fMLP injected intracisternally during pneumococcal meningitis also increased brain water content. The fMLP did not significantly increase intracranial pressure or CSF concentrations of lactate or protein in sterile or pneumococcal meningitis, nor did it cause brain edema in neutropenic animals. Thus, granulocytes may contribute to brain edema during meningitis if adequately stimulated, but intracranial pressure and CSF protein and lactate concentrations appear independent of granulocytes. Stimulation does not appear to occur early in meningitis, when granulocytes were without effect on brain edema.\r"

This assay was a specific and sensitive marker of the kidney PMNL content. We used this assay to measure in rats with AEP the effect of dexamethasone, administered in an attempt to mitigate the acute inflammatory response. Compared with saline, dexamethasone given during AEP strikingly reduced kidney swelling, measured by the kidney-weight increase, but failed to reduce PMNL infiltration, measured by the kidney MPO content. Despite reduced kidney swelling during AEP, dexamethasone treatment failed to prevent subsequent kidney scarring, an observation indicating that PMNLs play a role in the development of permanent kidney damage during AEP.\r"

The ability of these techniques to match patients' and epidemiologically linked environmental isolates from outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease at seven institutions was also compared. Two different panels of monoclonal antibodies (I and II) identified nine subtypes (one new disease-causing subtype) and six subtypes, respectively. The Bellingham 1 subtype type was the most common among environmental isolates, and the Philadelphia 1 subtype predominated among patients' isolates from all institutions except the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The source of an isolate (patient vs. environment) and its monoclonal antibody subtype were significantly associated (P less than .01). With use of the molecular techniques tested, the subtypes of patients' isolates were identical to those of epidemiologically linked environmental isolates from the same hospital.\r"

Patients were unlikely to be epidemiologically linked either with each other or with the 44 sampled environmental sites (14 air conditioning systems and 30 buildings) that were selected at random in the Paris area. According to their monoclonal antibody patterns, isolates belonged to 14 subgroups. Monoclonal antibody 2 recognized 121 (93.8%) of 129 clinical isolates and 30 (35.3%) of 85 environmental isolates (P less than 10(-9)). Of the eight patients infected with L. pneumophila not recognized with monoclonal antibody 2, seven were immunocompromised; only 46.3% of the 121 patients infected with L. pneumophila reactive with monoclonal antibody 2 were immunocompromised (P = .02). We conclude that monoclonal antibody 2 can be used as a marker for the more virulent strains of L. pneumophila serogroup 1.\r"

Subjects received both regimens one week apart; the regimen used first for each subject was randomized. Nine receiving the 1000-mg dose experienced the \"red-man (neck)\" syndrome; none had the reaction while receiving the 500-mg dose (P = .002). Plasma histamine concentration, measured every 10 min during the first infusion of each regimen, increased in most subjects given 1000-mg doses; there was only a slight change in histamine levels after 500-mg doses. There was a significant relation between histamine release and reaction severity; frequency and severity of the reaction declined with subsequent doses. We conclude that the red-man syndrome occurs frequently in normal adults who receive 1000 mg of vancomycin over 1 h, that vancomycin causes an infusion rate-dependent increase in plasma histamine concentration, and that the increase in plasma histamine concentration is correlated with the severity of the reaction.\r"

No significant differences in risk among patient categories were observed. Infected patients received a significantly larger mean number of units of cellular blood products (CBP; 50.0 +/- 38.9 vs. 6.2 +/- 8.5; P less than .001) and plasma (23.7 +/- 15.3 vs. 2.6 +/- 4.6, P less than .001) than did uninfected patients. This result represents a risk per unit of CBP transfused of 0.14%, or approximately 0.38% per unit of seropositive CBP transfused. We observed, however, that patients exposed to CBP from greater than 30 donors had a higher risk of acquiring CMV infection than would be predicted if infectious units were randomly distributed among all donors (P less than .01).\r"

Sixty-four percent of subjects from each country had detectable levels of specific IgG, indicating infection sometime in life. Detection of specific IgG increased in the two- to three-year-old age-group, a result suggesting that this is a common age for infection. Persistence of IgG and, less often, IgM antibody response over 12 mo occurred in some subjects, although the significance of this finding is uncertain. Our findings suggest that Cryptosporidium infections are endemic in the communities surveyed and that most residents have been infected.\r"

The adherence of chromium 51-labeled neutrophils from patients with diabetes in the basal state and after incubation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) but not N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) was decreased significantly. A subset of 16 of 26 patients demonstrated highly significant decreases in basal adhesion. No significant correlation was found between defective adherence and metabolic control as assessed by plasma glucose level (range 44 to 508 mg/dl) and hemoglobin A1 level (range 7.7% to 17.1%) at the time of study. Plasma from patients with diabetes increased adherence of both diabetic and control neutrophils in the basal state. The adherence-augmenting factor in diabetic plasma was found to be nonfilterable and partially heat labile and to manifest the characteristics of a protein. The adhesive effects of diabetic plasma were mediated through alterations in endothelium rather than neutrophils. Diabetic neutrophil aggregation induced by PMA, FMLP, and calcium ionophore was normal in all patients examined, regardless of the aggregating agent used. Fibronectin release in the basal state and after stimulation with FMLP was found to be comparable in diabetic and control neutrophils. These studies demonstrated intrinsic adhesive dysfunction of diabetic neutrophils and a factor or factors in diabetic plasma that enhanced adherence to endothelium. These cellular and humoral factors may act together to prevent tissue emigration of neutrophils and may contribute to the pathogenesis and susceptibility of infection in diabetes.\r"

The studies demonstrate that preincubation of monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with LPS has a significantly greater effect on neutrophil adherence to endothelium than does preincubation of neutrophils with LPS (P less than 0.001 for each amount of LPS). Although the effect was small compared with incubation of endothelial cells with LPS, incubation of neutrophils with LPS did significantly increase their subsequent adherence to endothelial cells compared with controls (P less than 0.05). LPS was not toxic to either endothelial cells or neutrophils, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase. Preincubation of endothelial cells with LPS at a concentration of 1.0 to 10 micrograms/ml maximally increased their ability to bind to neutrophils, and this effect was maximally expressed after 4 hours of exposure to LPS. In the assay, neutrophil binding to LPS-stimulated endothelial cells was rapid and did not increase after 30 minutes of coculture of neutrophils and endothelium. Morphologic studies demonstrated that LPS opened cell-to-cell junctions between endothelial cells. Neutrophils that attached to these monolayers of LPS-stimulated endothelial cells bound, primarily, to the margins of the endothelial cells and not to the underlying tissue culture dishes, which were exposed after incubation with LPS. These observations suggest that LPS increases neutrophil adherence primarily, but not solely, via an effect on endothelial cells.\r"

Increased production of superoxide (O2-) and H2O2 by alveolar macrophages may contribute to the pathogenesis of cigarette-induced lung diseases. The cytotoxicity mediated by alveolar macrophages from smokers (n = 11) and nonsmokers (n = 13) was compared in an in vitro assay in which the target cells were chromium 51-labeled lung explants. The spontaneous cellular cytotoxicity mediated by smoker macrophages was significantly greater than that of nonsmoker macrophages (cytotoxic index 20.3% +/- 1.9% compared with 5.5% +/- 0.9%, P less than 0.001). Phorbol myristate acetate significantly increased the cytotoxic index of nonsmoker macrophages but did not cause further increases in smoker macrophage killing. The antioxidants superoxide dismutase and catalase produced partial inhibition of smoker macrophage cytotoxicity, suggesting that target cell killing was mediated in part by oxidant mechanisms. Supplementation of smokers' diets with high-dose oral vitamin E failed to decrease smoker alveolar macrophage cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate that smoker alveolar macrophages possess enhanced cytotoxic potential for normal lung parenchymal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments to explore human platelet protein phosphorylation changes and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) secretion after challenge with cotton bract tannin were performed. Quantitative changes in sodium phosphate phosphorus 32 incorporation in two platelet proteins of 19 kilodaltons (kd) and 47 kd were assessed by measuring protein band densities on autoradiographs of dried polyacrylamide gels. Secretion of 5-HT was assessed by 14C-5-HT release. Results show that tannin causes increases in phosphorylation of discrete platelet proteins that begin in less than 2 seconds. These increases are maximal in 1 minute for the 47 kd protein and in 3 minutes for the 19 kd protein. Fifty percent of maximum response required less than 2 seconds for both of these proteins, and 50% of maximum 5-HT secretion required 48 seconds. Dose-response studies comparing 0 to 50 micrograms/ml tannin with 0 to 1 U/ml human alpha-thrombin showed that tannin caused 5-HT secretion and protein phosphorylation changes that were very similar to those induced by human alpha-thrombin. Fifty micrograms per milliliter of tannin caused increases in 19 kd protein phosphorylation and 47 kd protein phosphorylation to 312% +/- 34% (SEM) and 204% +/- 13% of control, respectively (n = 14). One unit per milliliter of thrombin induced changes of 350% +/- 40% and 221% +/- 17% of control in the 19 kd and 47 kd proteins, respectively. Release of 5-HT by tannin and thrombin was 61% +/- 3% and 69% +/- 3% of total cellular 5-HT, respectively. Indomethacin had little inhibitory effect on activation by these two different agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Washed platelet suspensions are almost always prepared from blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate. Because citrate has been reported to affect platelet function, we examined the involvement of citrate on the platelet-fibrinogen interactions. More iodine 125-labeled fibrinogen was bound on washed platelets from citrate-anticoagulated blood (CP) than on washed platelets from non-anticoagulated blood (PNB) obtained by the rapid gel filtration of native blood from the same donor. Scatchard analyses of the equilibrium binding data gave linear plots for PNB indicating a single class of binding sites with 16,480 +/- 2,800 fibrinogen molecules bound per platelet (Kd 5.6 x 10(-7) mol/L); CP gave curvilinear plots that, when resolved into two components assuming two classes of binding sites, gave a high-affinity site (4,950 +/- 970 molecules per platelet; Kd 1.29 x 10(-7) mol/L) and a low-affinity site (25,660 +/- 4,600 molecules per platelet; Kd 1.02 x 10(-6) mol/L). When blood from one donor was collected into 10 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L citrate, increased binding of 125I-fibrinogen was observed on platelets exposed to 20 mmol/L citrate. Exposure of PNB to varying citrate concentrations showed enhanced fibrinogen binding with increasing citrate concentrations; differences in the Kd values between non-citrate-treated PNB and citrate-treated PNB were apparent at about 7.5 mmol/L of citrate. The effects of citrate in increasing the association of fibrinogen with platelets were not caused by variations in the pH; although fibrinogen binding was diminished at low pH of the citrate used, more binding was observed in the presence of citrate than with buffer of the same pH. The effects of citrate appear to be on the platelet fibrinogen receptor because nonspecific binding was not affected by the citrate. Inasmuch as no carbon 14-labeled citric acid binding to platelets was observed, citrate may affect the platelet-fibrinogen interactions without binding to the platelets. We conclude that platelet exposure to citrate increases the fibrinogen binding and may lead to the appearance of curved Scatchard plots.\r"

  ".U": "88140596\r", 
  ".W": "The normal ranges of orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate have been defined in 92 individuals aged 18 to 64 years. In 34 individuals whose symptoms (especially orthostatic light-headedness) suggested cerebral ischemia, but in whom none of the known causes of orthostatic hypotension could be identified, we have found one or more of five theoretically possible orthostatic circulatory derangements: systolic hypotension, diastolic hypotension, diastolic hypertension, excessive narrowing of the pulse pressure, and tachycardia after standing for at least 3 minutes. The orthostatic disorders of blood pressure and heart rate identified in the 34 patients were significantly reduced, almost always into the normal range, by external pressure of 45 to 50 mm Hg applied through an inflatable pressure suit. After labeling with sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m and reinjecting the erythrocytes contained in 3 to 6 ml blood, external gamma counting over a fixed site in the calf, both in the recumbent and in the standing posture, showed excessive gravitational pooling of blood in the legs of five patients with orthostatic diastolic hypertension, of four with orthostatic narrowing of the pulse pressure, and of 10 with orthostatic tachycardia alone. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were usually normal in recumbency and elevated above normal limits during standing for 15 to 30 minutes in the 18 patients so observed. Red cell mass, plasma volume, and circulating blood volume were subnormal in more than half the seven patients in whom these measurements were made. We conclude that most of the patients with idiopathic sympathicotonic abnormalities of orthostatic blood pressure control have a venous pooling syndrome often aggravated by hypovolemia, the cause(s) of which remains to be determined.\r"

  ".U": "88140597\r", 
  ".W": "Phosphoinositide content was measured in erythrocyte membranes from 11 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and from 12 control subjects to determine whether altered levels of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (Ptdlns4P) or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Ptdlns(4,5)P2) are responsible for the decrease in Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2+-ATPase) activity in this disorder. Isolated membranes were extracted with an acidified chloroform-methanol solvent system. The recovered lipids were separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and quantified with a colorimetric assay for phosphorus. The results are expressed in molar percent, moles of phosphoinositide times 100 divided by the total number of moles of phospholipid per membrane. The means +/- SEM of Ptdlns(4,5)P2, Ptdlns4P, and phosphatidylinositol (Ptdlns) in CF membranes (1.07 +/- 0.18, 1.02 +/- 0.22, and 2.32 +/- 0.36 molar percent, respectively) were indistinguishable from controls (0.91 +/- 0.14, 0.85 +/- 0.12, and 2.21 +/- 0.32 molar percent, respectively) (P greater than 0.20 for all three pairs). The accuracy of quantitative recovery throughout the procedure was determined by adding a radioactive internal standard, L-3-phosphatidyl[2-3H]inositol to 10 membrane preparations. Although quantitative recoveries, as determined by percent radioactivity recovered, varied from 54% to 92%, mean Ptdlns(4,5)P2, Ptdlns4P, and Ptdlns levels appropriately corrected from tracer loss were still indistinguishable between the two groups. We conclude that absolute phosphoinositide levels are not altered in cystic fibrosis erythrocyte membranes and that the differences in Ca2+-ATPase activity cannot be explained on this basis.\r"

  ".U": "88140599\r", 
  ".W": "Cutaneous mast cell degranulation in rats results in tissue inflammation, and this species has therefore provided a useful model to study the pathogenesis of late phase reactions (LPRs). The mast cell dependency of LPRs has been confirmed by the demonstration that isolated rat mast cell granules (MCGs), when injected intradermally into rat skin, induce patterns of tissue inflammation similar to those seen after skin testing with anti-IgE antibody. Rat LPRs are neutrophil dependent, and, further, MCG-derived inflammatory factors can chemically attract rat neutrophils in vitro. To further study the relationships among MCGs, tissue inflammation, and neutrophil function, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) responses of rat peritoneal-elicited neutrophils in response to opsonized zymosan and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in the presence and absence of MCGs were analyzed. When MCGs (1.0, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml) alone were added to neutrophil suspensions, a rapid concentration-dependent increase in baseline CL responses was observed; these increases (maximum of sixfold) were modest, varied with cell concentrations, and followed different time courses compared with those seen after addition of preopsonized zymosan (0.5 mg/ml) (50-fold increases that peaked in 4 to 8 minutes). However, if neutrophils were preincubated (15 minutes) in the presence of MCGs, the CL response to opsonized zymosan (1.25 mg/ml) was significantly and synergistically enhanced compared with the response seen with MCGs alone. Similar but less pronounced effects were also noted after cell activation with PMA (2.5 and 25 ng/ml). To determine which component of the MCG was responsible for this enhancing activity, additional experiments were performed. Enhancement was still observed, albeit less intense, if MCGs were prepared membrane free and washed free of readily dissociable mediators such as histamine. Histamine (10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/L) had no enhancing effect nor did preparations of MCG membranes. MCG solubilization (3 mol/L NH4HCO3) revealed that the enhancing activity resided completely in the high molecular weight (greater than 10,000 daltons) fraction. Heat treatment of the granules and sodium azide preincubation completely abolished the enhancing effect. Exogenous horseradish peroxidase, at peroxidase activity levels contained within the MCGs (1 x 10(-4) to 10(-2) U/ml), reproduced the enhancing effect. After opsonized zymosan activation, neutrophils generated less H2O2 and superoxide anion in the presence of MCGs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Histologically the lesions are composed of proliferating capillary vessels associated with a heavy inflammatory infiltrate including eosinophils and mast cells. The cause remains obscure. The lesions often persist for many years and may regress spontaneously. Several forms of treatment have been used, including cryosurgery, curettage and diathermy, radiotherapy and intralesional steroid injections. In this case the Argon laser was employed.\r"

When the pillar cells have been destroyed the scar epithelium from the Claudius cells has reached the IHC's, which show a remarkable resistance to acoustic trauma. Their presence in a large healed area may be the only remnants of a previous sensory region. When even the IHC's are absent, the entire organ of Corti can be replaced both by Claudius cells and by inner sulcus cells covering the denuded basilar membrane without any clear morphological difference between the two cellular sources.\r"

A review of these cases demonstrates that the results of revision stapedectomy are different from those of primary stapedectomy. The commonest cause of failure was prosthetic dislocation (30.8 per cent), followed by fibrous adhesions (18.3 per cent) and otosclerotic regrowth (14.1 per cent). First revision operations resulted in post-operative bone-air gaps of 15 dB. or less in 46.5 per cent of cases, much better than 25 per cent for second revisions. Primary stapedectomy resulted in successful closure of the air-bone gap to 15 dB. or less in 89.5 per cent of cases. The sensorineural loss occurred in 11.3 per cent or first revisions and in 16.6 per cent of second revisions, as compared to 1.3 per cent after primary surgery. 'Dead ears' were encountered in 2.2 per cent of first revisions, as compared to nil in the primary group.\r"

To investigate the etiological role of genetic factors in ORC-related symptoms, we studied questionnaire responses in 715 monozygotic and 416 dizygotic volunteer twin pairs concordant for ORC usage. Biometrical genetic analysis indicated that the liability to ORC-related depression was clearly influenced by genetic but not familial-environmental factors. Similar, but less definitive, results were found for ORC-related irritability. Multivariate genetic analysis indicated that both the genetic and the individual-specific environmental factors that influenced the liability to ORC-related depression and irritability were largely distinct from those that influence baseline levels of psychiatric symptoms. Genes play an important etiological role in ORC-related psychiatric side effects. The genes that influence liability to these side effects appear to differ from those that are etiologically important in baseline psychiatric symptomatology.\r"

Evaluations were completed closer to admission with patients admitted during the day and evening shifts and with patients having more obvious psychiatric problems, i.e., brought involuntarily, with a known psychiatric history, given a psychotic diagnosis in the emergency room, or subsequently sent to a psychiatric hospital. Such factors failed to affect the actual length of the psychiatric evaluation. The multiple time pressures in an emergency room setting appeared to affect when, but not how long, clinicians evaluated psychiatric patients. The time that emergency room clinicians take to begin evaluations of psychiatric patients may reflect important observational data that affect their temporal, diagnostic, and recommended treatment patterns.\r"

The subjects were 83 male alcoholic Veterans Administration inpatients 50 years of age or under. The Alcohol Use Inventory, various alcohol-related symptoms and behaviors, and laboratory values were used to evaluate the severity/pattern of alcoholism. Psychopathology/personality were measured by the MMPI, the Psychopathic State Inventory, the MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale, the Childhood Problem Behaviors Questionnaire, and the percentage of patients with an antisocial personality disorder (ASP) diagnosis. Surprisingly few subgroup differences were revealed in the severity/pattern of alcoholism. Only age at time of treatment and use of nonalcoholic drugs were associated with increasing familial alcoholism. On the other hand, childhood behavior problems, particularly antisocial behavior, and an ASP diagnosis were found to be associated with an increasing degree of familial alcoholism. The diagnosis of ASP was most apparent in the two-generational and bilineal alcoholics, while an increased degree of familial alcoholism was not associated with ASP for the conventional classification. Bilineal familial alcoholics also exhibited an MMPI profile reflective of a characterological disorder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During a 2.5-year follow-up of opioid addicts, we examined psychosocial antecedents and consequences of the onset and remission of cocaine abuse. Patients who never used cocaine were compared with those whose use increased or decreased along several dimensions of treatment outcome including drug abuse, legal, employment, family, social, psychological, and medical problems. Cocaine abuse had a marked impact on almost every outcome area except medical problems. Patients whose cocaine use increased during follow-up had more severe problems than either those whose use decreased or those who never used cocaine. Furthermore, the attainment of cocaine abstinence among abusers was associated with improved psychosocial functioning, whereas the onset of cocaine abuse was associated with increased problem severity. Compared with drug-free and detoxification alone treatments, methadone maintenance may minimize legal complications of cocaine abuse, but otherwise it did not significantly reduce psychosocial morbidity from increasing cocaine abuse. These findings suggest that treatment-seeking opioid addicts are vulnerable to wide-ranging deterioration when they become increasingly involved with cocaine but that with the attainment of abstinence many problem areas improve.\r"

Medical students high in both power and intimacy motivation were more depressed, neurotic, fatalistic, and self-doubting than were their classmates. These effects began at the end of year 1, peaked in year 2, and disappeared by the end of clerkships. High intimacy-low power students had the highest levels of well-being. These effects were equally true in men and women and both support and render more precise prior role conflict explanations.\r"

Follow-up information was obtained on 166 patients until death, surgery, or other intervention, or for at least 4 years after diagnosis (mean follow-up time 8.2 years). All available cerebral arteriograms and computerized tomography scans of the head were reviewed. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 31 patients (18%), due to AVM rupture in 29 and secondary to AVM or aneurysm rupture in two. The mean risk of hemorrhage was 2.2% per year, and the observed annual rates of hemorrhage increased over time. The risk of death from rupture was 29%, and 23% of survivors had significant long-term morbidity. The size of the AVM and the presence of treated or untreated hypertension were of no value in predicting rupture.\r"

This approach is based on a combination of King and Morrison's translabyrinthine-transtentorial approach and on the extended approach through the middle cranial fossa described by Bochenek and Kukwa. There were two hospital deaths (operative mortality 1.6%). In 102 operations on the initial tumor, total removal was performed in 89 cases (87%), and in 71 (80%) of these the facial nerve was anatomically preserved. Intracranial end-to-end anastomosis was performed on five of the 18 sacrificed facial nerves; a facial-hypoglossal anastomosis was carried out in the remaining 13 patients and in five (7%) of the 71 patients whose anatomically preserved facial nerve functioned poorly. In seven (39%) of the 18 patients in whom an attempt to preserve hearing was made, postoperative hearing was saved. In 23 operations on 17 patients for recurrent tumors, most of which had previously been removed subtotally via the suboccipital approach, total removal was accomplished in 13 (57% of the 23 reoperations and 76% of the 17 patients). At reoperation, the facial nerve was preserved in six (55%) of the 11 patients in whom the facial nerve had not been sacrificed. Postoperative leakage of cerebrospinal fluid occurred in 11 cases (8.8%), with rhinorrhea in 10 cases and otorrhea in one. Five of the fistulas were corrected by surgery and the rest healed spontaneously. Other complications were not significant.\r"

Based on a series of 22 cases, the authors propose a classification comprising three categories: spinal extradural MC's without spinal nerve root fibers (Type I); spinal extradural MC's with spinal nerve root fibers (Type II); and spinal intradural MC's (Type III). Although water-soluble myelography may disclose a filling defect for all three categories, computerized tomographic myelography (CTM) is essential to reveal communication between the cyst and the subarachnoid space. Communication demonstrated by CTM allows accurate diagnosis of a spinal MC and rules out other mass lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging appears useful as an initial study to identify an intraspinal cystic mass. Final characterization is based on operative inspection and histological examination for all three categories.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven patients with medulloblastoma were treated postoperatively with procarbazine, followed by craniospinal radiation therapy in combination with hydroxyurea. The radiation dose to the posterior fossa was 55 Gy; the spinal cord received 25 Gy and the whole brain 25 to 35 Gy (mean 33 Gy). Seventeen tumors recurred. Only one initial recurrence was in the spinal subarachnoid space; 10 (59%) were in the posterior fossa, and four (24%) were supratentorial. The estimated 5-year disease-free survival probability was 55%; the 5-year overall survival rate was 66%. Myelotoxicity occurred in 38% of patients, but in only one case was it severe enough to warrant reducing the total dose of radiation. It was concluded that good-risk medulloblastoma patients may be treated with radiation dosages as low as 25 Gy to the spinal axis and to the whole brain without increasing the risk of recurrence outside the posterior fossa. Chemotherapy with procarbazine followed by radiation therapy and hydroxyurea during radiation therapy was well tolerated and may play a role in reducing radiation dosages outside the posterior fossa.\r"

  ".U": "88140883\r", 
  ".W": "A dose-escalation study of the calcium ion entry blocking drug nicardipine was performed using large dose infusions in 67 patients with recent aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A safe, potentially therapeutic dose of the drug was determined. Patients admitted within 7 days of SAH from a documented cerebral aneurysm were entered into the study if no spasm was present on the initial angiogram. Nicardipine was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion throughout the 14-day period after SAH, regardless of the timing of surgery. To determine the safest possible dose, nicardipine was administered at seven dose levels from 0.01 to 0.15 mg/kg/hr. The total daily doses ranged from 27.7 mg to 375.0 mg. A follow-up angiogram was carried out on all 67 patients 7 to 10 days after SAH. Computerized tomography and neurological examinations were used to determine the presence of cerebral infarction. No major adverse effects, unexpected reactions, or permanent sequelae could be attributed to nicardipine. A decline in blood pressure was noted following administration of the drug. This occurred more frequently among patients given the largest dose but did not produce clinical problems or require discontinuation of the drug. Favorable outcomes were noted in 52 patients (78%). Vasospasm was found by arteriography in 31 patients (46%). A dose-related trend was noted: only eight (24%) of 33 patients treated at the highest dose level (approximately 10 mg/hr) developed arteriographic evidence of vasospasm. Symptomatic vasospasm was diagnosed in only two (6%) of 33 patients treated with this dose. Of the 34 patients receiving the lower dose levels, angiographic spasm was observed in 68% and symptomatic vasospasm in 27%. No deaths due to vasospasm occurred. Nicardipine appears to prevent both vasospasm and cerebral ischemia after SAH. A multicenter randomized double-blind trial to test this hypothesis is planned.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen patients with ventricular cerebrospinal fluid shunts in place for chronic hydrocephalus presented with a history and neurological deficits usually associated with high intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by an obstructed shunt system. However, the symptoms were characteristically present when the patient was upright and active, and were usually relieved by lying down. The symptoms of intermittent headache, nausea, emesis, lethargy, and diplopia were associated with paresis of upward gaze or minimal strabismus. Measurement of ICP showed unexpected dramatically low levels with a marked drop in pressure when the patient was in the upright position, whereas ICP was near normal when the patient was supine. The low ICP was corrected by insertion of a high-pressure Flo-Control valve into the shunt system already in place. Postoperatively, the immediate clinical improvement and more normal ICP measurements were striking. The important clinical finding in this group of patients was the presence of disabling symptoms which occurred when the patients were up and active and which were relieved by lying down. Measurements of ICP with the patient in the supine and then in the upright position were critical in establishing an accurate diagnosis of symptomatic low ICP in these hydrocephalic patients with indwelling shunts. With the patient in the Trendelenburg position, ICP showed a marked increase, as expected; in some patients this position was prescribed as treatment for several days before surgery.\r"

This \"pediatric population\" was compared to the remaining \"adult population\" for mechanism of injury, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, motor score, blood pressure, pupillary reactivity, the presence of associated injuries, and the presence of subdural or epidural hematoma. The relationship of each of these factors was then correlated with post-traumatic mortality. Except for patients found to have subdural hematoma and those who were profoundly hypotensive, the pediatric patients exhibited a significantly lower mortality rate compared to the adults, thus confirming this generally held view. This study indicates that age itself, even within the pediatric age range, is a major independent factor affecting the mortality rate in head-injured patients.\r"

These patients represent 10.5% of a series of 520 patients with severe head injury studied with computerized tomography (CT). Cerebral hemispheric swelling has the highest mortality rate and the shortest survival period after trauma in all series of severe head injury. In this series, it was associated with an ipsilateral subdural hematoma of variable size in 47 patients (85%) or with a large epidural hematoma in five patients (9%); in three patients (5.4%) it occurred as an isolated lesion. Evacuation of an associated extracerebral hematoma, which was performed within 4 hours after injury in only 20% of cases, scarcely changed the patients' preoperative neurological status. The high incidence of arterial hypotension and/or hypoxemia at admission (47% of cases) and the severity of the clinical presentation (82% of patients scored 5 points or less on the Glasgow Coma Scale, 74% had unilateral or bilateral mydriasis, and 80% had an initial ICP above normal) correlated with a very poor final outcome (87% mortality). Only one of the 11 patients with normal initial ICP continued to have normal pressure throughout the course. High-dose thiopental failed to control severe intracranial hypertension in 24 patients (51%) who had a fulminant, malignant course. A transient decrease in ICP elevation was achieved in 15 patients (31.4%) and definitive control in eight patients (17%), among whom were the seven survivors in this series. In the authors' experience, once ICP is controlled, barbiturate administration should not be discontinued until a control CT scan shows complete disappearance of the mass effect.\r"

  ".U": "88140890\r", 
  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies were produced by immunization of the human glioma cell line SK-MG-4. One of the antibodies, designated G-22, reacted with 18 of 20 glioma cell lines, two melanoma cell lines, and three lung cancer cell lines, but not with 39 cell lines derived from sarcoma, carcinoma, or hematopoietic tumors. The antigen was expressed in the brain of human fetuses in early gestation (9 weeks) but not in late gestation (8 months) or in normal adult brain, suggesting that the antibody recognizes neural differentiation antigens expressed by neuroectodermal origin. A high incidence of positive antigens has been observed in gliomas but not in the other neural tumors, such as ependymomas, meningiomas, and neuroblastomas. Thus, the antigen defined by the G-22 monoclonal antibody could be defined as glioma-associated antigen. Pulse-labeling with tritiated leucine and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the solubilized cell membrane revealed that the antigen recognized by this antibody had a molecular weight of 67 kD on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It was shown by dot-blot enzyme-linked immunospecific assay (ELISA) that the antigen could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with gliomas. From analysis of affinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE, the antigen present in the CSF had a molecular weight similar to that of a 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) extract from a glioma cell line. When the antigen in CSF was quantitatively assayed by ELISA, the mean antigen level (expressed as optical density at 450 nm) in the CSF of seven patients was 0.8 +/- 0.28 (mean +/- standard deviation), which was significantly higher than the 0.38 +/- 0.14 level observed in the CSF of 15 patients with nonglioma brain tumors and the 0.23 +/- 0.09 level in the CSF of four patients without brain tumors. These results indicate that the monoclonal antibody G-22 is useful for the diagnosis of glioma.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of a novel non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid U74006F to inhibit lipid peroxidation of central nervous system tissue in vitro and to enhance the early neurological recovery and survival of mice after a severe concussive head injury is described. In the in vitro studies, U74006F was found to be an extremely potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in an assay system where the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone and the non-glucocortoid steroids U72099E and U75718A were almost completely ineffective. In the head-injury studies, unanesthetized male CF-1 mice were subjected to a 900 gm-cm closed head injury produced by a 50-gm weight being dropped 18 cm. This concussive injury resulted in immediate unconsciousness (loss of righting reflex) in all animals and death in approximately 30%. Survivors received a tail vein injection of either vehicle or U74006F (0.001 to 30 mg/kg) within 5 minutes postinjury. Their neurological status was evaluated 1 hour later using a grip test. The grip-test score indicated that intravenous administration of a single dose of U74006F resulted in a significant improvement by as much as 168.6% in the neurological status 1 hour postinjury over a broad dose range (0.003 to 30 mg/kg). A 1-mg/kg dose given intravenously within 5 minutes and again at 1 1/2 hours after a severe injury, in addition to improving early recovery, also increased the 1-week survival rate to 78.6% compared to 27.3% in vehicle-treated mice (p less than 0.02). The compound was also effective in enhancing early recovery after a more moderate injury. This study demonstrates that early treatment after severe concussive head injury with a potent inhibitor of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation can significantly benefit the injured brain in mice and promote both early neurological recovery and long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of a single intravenous dose of the 21-aminosteroid U74006F to affect the development of posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia was examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. After surgical preparation, each animal received a 300 gm-cm contusion injury to the exposed L-3 vertebral segment, followed by a single bolus injection of vehicle or U74006F (3 or 10 mg/kg) at 30 minutes postinjury. Spinal cord white matter blood flow (SCBF) was measured by hydrogen clearance in the dorsolateral funiculus in the center of the injured segment before and at various times up to 4 hours after injury. In vehicle-treated cats, there was a progressive decline in SCBF over the course of the experiment. By 4 hours postinjury, SCBF had decreased from a preinjury value of 15.9 +/- 2.4 ml/100 gm/min (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 5.8 +/- 0.8 ml/100 gm/min, representing a decline of 63.5%. In contrast, the SCBF measured 4 hours postinjury in cats that were treated with a single 10-mg/kg dose of U74006F was 13.6 +/- 1.7 ml/100 gm/min (p less than 0.001 vs. vehicle). Animals that received a 3-mg/kg intravenous dose of U74006F displayed a drop in SCBF equal to that of vehicle-treated cats. However, when a 3-mg/kg dose of U74006F was given to four vehicle-treated cats at the end of the experiment, a partial reversal of ischemia was recorded. Blood flow increased within 30 minutes from a mean of 4.5 +/- 0.8 to 7.4 +/- 1.0 ml/100 gm/min or an increase of 64.4% (p less than 0.05). This rather surprising effect of U74006F in reversing posttraumatic ischemia once it has developed significantly is not shared by a 30-mg/kg intravenous dose of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP), although MP has previously been shown to attenuate the posttraumatic drop in SCBF when given before the SCBF drop occurs. The mechanism of action of U74006F in antagonizing posttraumatic ischemia development is believed to involve the ability of the compound to inhibit iron-dependent lipid peroxidation in central nervous system tissue.\r"

Although arachnoiditis was present in both patients, the striking abnormality found at surgery was the softened appearance and the microcystic degeneration of the cord. The microcystic spinal cord degeneration found in these cases represents a previously undescribed cause of late deterioration after spinal cord injury that may mimic the clinical, CT-myelographic, and magnetic resonance features of posttraumatic syringomyelia.\r"

However, the ability to predict which patients with TOA would respond to antibiotic therapy could shorten the hospital stay and decrease treatment costs. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase-reactant protein with a short half-life, was investigated as a possible predictor of response by TOA patients to medical therapy. Twenty-two patients with TOAs were admitted prospectively into this study, which included daily quantitative determinations of CRP. The patients had either resolution of the mass and symptoms (responders), increased evidence of systemic sepsis and acute peritonitis requiring surgery (failures) or continuation of the tender adnexal mass without evidence of peritoneal irritation (persisters). Twelve patients classified as responders showed a continued daily decrease in quantitative CRP levels of at least 20% per day below the previous day's value until the return to normal levels. The five failures showed a progressive rise in CRP levels as well as evidence of systemic sepsis. Persisters showed an initial decrease in the CRP level followed by a leveling off of the value to a decrease of less than 20% per day. The rate at which daily CRP determinations decline may be a useful predictor of the response to antibiotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor cell metastasis is a complex process that depends in part on tumor cell adhesion to components of basement membranes and the extracellular matrix. Previous studies have indicated that the experimental metastasis of murine melanoma cells can be inhibited by ex vivo pretreatment of cells with purified adhesion-promoting fragments of laminin or the synthetic peptide arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine (RGDS) prior to tail vein injection. This study extended the earlier reports to demonstrate that adhesion-promoting fragments of laminin and fibronectin can inhibit the metastasis of a tumor of different histologic origin, such as murine fibrosarcoma cells. Furthermore, ex vivo pretreatment of cells with a purified 33-kDa heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin, which promotes tumor cell adhesion by an RGDS-independent mechanism, was effective at inhibiting experimental melanoma and fibrosarcoma pulmonary metastases. The survival rate of animals receiving tumor cells pretreated with this fragment was significantly enhanced relative to control groups. As with previous studies, the mechanism of inhibition appeared to involve an increased clearance rate of tumor cells from the pulmonary microcirculation. These results suggest a role for cell surface proteoglycans in the adhesion and metastasis of certain malignant neoplasms. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the complexity of tumor metastasis and suggests that multiple strategies may be developed to inhibit hematogenous metastasis formation.\r"

Individual markers were studied, and optimal combinations of markers were sought for discriminating patients with localized lung cancer from normal controls and from patients with benign lung disease. Both logistic regression and recursive partitioning methods for discrimination were tried. The best rules involved only CEA and ferritin for discriminating patients with lung cancer from normal controls, and CEA and age for discriminating patients with lung cancer from those with benign lung diseases. The performance of these rules was validated on an independent serum panel containing sera from 56 patients with localized lung cancer, 75 normal controls, and 75 patients with benign lung diseases. Three rules designed to achieve 95% specificity against normal controls attained 14%-36% sensitivity for localized lung cancer in the validation panels, whereas three rules designed to achieve 95% specificity against benign lung diseases attained 30%-39% sensitivity. Some aspects of potential clinical applications are discussed.\r"

Complete remission was achieved in 37 +/- 10 per cent of the patients clinically, pathologically and after surgical resection of residual disease. With 17 of 31 complete responders (55 per cent) surviving for 26+ to 49+ months, the estimated probability of survival at 2 and 3 years was 71 and 55 per cent, respectively. Partial remission occurred in 31 +/- 10 per cent of the patients, while 8 per cent had a minor response and 23 per cent had progression with median survivals of 11, 11 and 7 months, respectively. Whereas all metastatic sites responded, including the bone and liver, complete tumor regression was observed more frequently with nodal, pulmonary and local-regional lesions. Brain metastases occurred within 6 to 42 months in 18 per cent of the responders, half of whom never had systemic relapse. Of the remaining 9 patients 2 with nontransitional cell histological tumors did not respond, 5 (5 per cent) were inadequately treated and 2 were excluded from response data because of inevaluable disease parameters but they were free of disease at 16+ and 31+ months. Toxicity was significant, with 20 per cent of the patients experiencing nadir sepsis, 4 per cent a drug-related death, 31 per cent +1 renal toxicity and 41 per cent +1 mucositis. The applications and advantages of the newly proposed international response criteria for bladder cancer are discussed in reference to 25 patients who underwent surgical re-staging, indicating that the disease was understaged clinically in 24 per cent (T less than P), as well as in reference to attainment of true (pathological) complete remission and to other urothelial tract trials. While this therapy seems to have limited antitumor activity against nontransitional cell histological cancer, stage Tis disease and later development of de novo lesions, the regimen is efficacious in selected patients with advanced urothelial tract transitional cell carcinoma.\r"

While significant downstaging occurred by transurethral resection of the bladder in 70 per cent and by cytology in 60 per cent of the patients, the final T response rate by all noninvasive clinical staging procedures, including sonography and computerized tomography, revealed complete remission in 24 per cent and partial remission in 39 per cent. Of 30 patients who underwent pathological staging 33 per cent achieved stage P0 and 17 per cent stage Tis disease or P less than T. Despite extensive re-evaluation by transurethral resection of the bladder and other noninvasive staging procedures, a clinical staging error (T versus P) of 38 per cent was observed. Of the other 9 patients 4 with mixed nontransitional cell histological findings at presentation never achieved complete remission, although 3 had resolution of all transitional cell elements and 5 (10 per cent) were inevaluable. The toxicity of the regimen was generally acceptable but 6 per cent of the patients required hospitalization for neutropenic fever. While this active regimen can clinically (T) and pathologically (P) induce downstaging in a significant number of patients with primary bladder tumors, this pilot study has raised serious questions concerning the design of future nonrandomized and randomized neoadjuvant studies.\r"

A family history of renal stones was more common among the female (45 per cent) than among the male patients (31 per cent). There was no relationship between family history of renal stones, and abnormal calcium and oxalate excretion rates. A significant association between a family history and a higher urinary pH was observed among the female calcium stone patients. A genetic defect in urinary acidification with variable expressivity might be associated with a high frequency of stone formation. Moreover, uric acid excretion was higher in male stone patients with a family history of stones. Finally, the parents and siblings of the renal stone patients were affected more by calculi than were the corresponding relatives of their spouses.\r"

In addition, a 3 to 6-month followup study of patients showing excessive protein excretion with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy also is reported. Our data suggest that with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy transient nephrotic range proteinuria occurs immediately after treatment, returning to normal values within 3 to 6 months after treatment without a change in the glomerular filtration rate. The glomerular filtration rate increases after successful extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with kidneys obstructed by the treated stone before the start of the procedure, and the kidney appears to maintain its ability to dilute urine and to conserve sodium after treatment.\r"

This decrease in stone movement theoretically lessens the total shock and energy requirements for stone fragmentation and perirenal tissue damage. To assess these theoretical advantages of high frequency jet ventilation, we studied patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to determine differences in stone movement during high frequency jet and conventional mechanical ventilation (30 patients), and in total shock requirements (1,174 patients). Mean stone movement in the 30 patients was 34.3 +/- 4.3 mm. during conventional mechanical ventilation compared to 4.1 +/- 1.9 mm. during high frequency jet ventilation (p less than 0.001). Mean total shocks were 1,542 +/- 212 (452 patients) during conventional mechanical ventilation compared to 1,217 +/- 165 (722 patients) during high frequency jet ventilation (p less than 0.001). Only 1 patient in the study had clinically significant perirenal tissue damage. We conclude that high frequency jet ventilation when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation results in clinically and economically beneficial decreases in total shocks for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy fragmentation of renal or ureteral calculi.\r"

Nonocclusive ureteral stones were not manipulated. Treatment of these stones in situ slightly increased the need for postoperative ancillary procedures, compared to successful repositioning into the kidney (5.9 versus 3 per cent). Secondary treatments, however, were necessary as often as with occlusive stones. The main reason for failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was the lack of fluid around an impacted stone.

Four factors account for their superiority: 1) their configuration takes advantage of the geometric fact that volume increases by the square of the radius so that a patch or pouch has a larger diameter than a tube, 2) they accommodate to filling more readily because, as LaPlace's law states, the container with the greater radius and, thus, the greater mural tension will hold larger volumes at lower pressure, 3) compliance is superior to that of the tubular bowel and 4) contractile ability is blunted by the failure of contractions to encompass the entire circumference. For these reasons detubularized segments store more urine at lower pressures.\r"

We consider this operation as an alternative to the artificial urinary sphincter in cases of male neurogenic sphincter incontinence.\r"

Histological sections were prepared from 8 regions along the length of the urethra from 26 women between 19 and 88 years old. Using quantitative morphological techniques the relative volume fractions of various tissue components were determined. As age increased there was a decrease in the relative volume of striated muscle and blood vessels, and an increase in the relative volume of connective tissue. There was no change in the smooth muscle components. These age changes in the human female urethra may lead to impairment of urethral function.\r"

The subjects were instructed to signal with a push button switch when they had attained an erection they judged sufficient for penetration. They were asked to signal a second time when a full erection had been reached. The results showed that in all but 1 case maximal tumescence was recorded polygraphically before the subjects signaled sufficiency. In addition, there was a considerable interval between the perception of sufficiency and the perception of a full erection during which, nevertheless, no further changes could be detected by strain gauge measurement. These data suggest that standard assessment techniques are not sensitive to penile changes in the upper ranges of tumescence. Of interest to the developing area of diurnal penile tumescence for the etiological diagnosis of impotence was the observation that a significant percentage (37 per cent) of normal subjects were unable to achieve a full erection during visual sexual stimulation under laboratory conditions.\r"

No tumor cells were found in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy, and only 2 patients with metastatic disease had tumor cells in the bone marrow when conventional hematomorphological preparations were examined. These findings suggest that immunocytochemistry can increase the detection rate of metastatic prostatic carcinoma cells. Further followup of larger numbers of patients with local carcinoma will reveal whether the presence of micrometastases denotes a poor prognosis.\r"

The retropubic space is entered through a dome-shaped incision in front of the urethral meatus in the anterior vaginal vestibule. The incision does not extend beyond the lower edge of the symphysis pubis. With the tip of the hemostat or scissors the incision is opened longitudinally, and the lower legs of the incision are opened and freed up from the bulbocavernosus muscles. The bleeders are controlled. The layers of the genitourinary diaphragm are opened beginning from behind the symphysis pubis and the retropubic cavity is exposed. Then, the vesical neck and urethra are sutured to the back of the symphysis pubis in the midline. With this procedure there is no abdominal incision. The vesical neck and urethra are well exposed. The back of the symphysis pubis can be visualized with the patient in an exaggerated Trendelenburg position. All except 1 patient were cured. Hospitalization and postoperative recovery times were markedly reduced. The procedure affords easy access for drainage of the retropubic space. A new avenue is provided for insertion of an artificial sphincter to achieve urinary continence and for vesical neck colposuspension.\r"

An affinity of uric acid or urate for selective urinary macromolecules in a liquid phase was supposed to be the origin of this matrix. But the proteins in the uric acid stone matrix were not separated by SDS-PAGE. Therefore we could not conclude whether the organic matrix of urinary uric acid crystals is similar to that of uric acid stones.\r"

In bladder base and body, respectively, the concentration (pmol./mg. wet weight) of norepinephrine was 23.4 and 2.16, of acetylcholine was 26.7 and 18.3, and of choline was 96.7 and 199. The activity (nmol./mg. protein/hour) of tyrosine hydroxylase was 422 and less than 50, of monoamine oxidase was 80.6 and 126, of choline acetyltransferase was 17.4 and 11.5, and of acetylcholinesterase (nmol./mg. wet weight/hour) was 485 and 165. Treatment with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine did not alter norepinephrine concentration in bladder base but decreased it by 27% in bladder body. Studies were also done to determine whether age-related changes exist in the adrenergic and cholinergic neurochemistry of the rat urinary bladder. Bladders from rats of 6-7, 15-17, and 22-24 mo. of age were examined. The only age-related differences noted were a progressive decrease in level of monoamine oxidase activity in both bladder regions and an increase in bladder base norepinephrine concentration from 6-7 to 15-17 mo. followed by a decrease at 22-24 mo. Overall, the results show marked regional variations in bladder neurochemistry which remain remarkably stable as the animals grow old.\r"

A ureteral tapering procedure was performed by lateral darting and posterior folding of the resultant flap, followed by a cross-trigonal reimplantation. One anastomotic stricture resulted; in the remaining 19 animals, ureteral peristalsis was restored, the ureteral diameter was reduced 61.9 per cent and hydronephrosis was resolved. Histological studies on the tapered segments of these 19 animals showed that the subadventitial blood supply was preserved with fibrotic occlusion of the folded flaps. These results demonstrate that no significant vascular compromise after ureteral tapering and cross-trigonal reimplantation occurs. Success rates comparable to those of conventional ureteral tailoring can be achieved by this technically simplified form of reconstructive surgery.\r"

The 24 hr. water intake, 24 hr. urine output, frequency and volume of each micturition were obtained from rats housed individually in metabolic cages. Intravesical pressure and volume at which the micturition contraction occurred were evaluated using natural-fill cystometry. The 24 hr. water intake and urine output increased significantly with advancing age; 22 to 24 months rats showed a 39% increase in water intake and a 93% increase in urine output compared to five to seven month rats. The increase in urine output observed in the 22 to 24 month old rats was manifested by a 95% increase in volume per micturition and a 52% increase in frequency of micturition compared to five to seven month old rats. The pressure at micturition (PAM) was 100% greater in 22 to 24 and 16 to 18 month old rats compared to five to seven month old rats with no age-related difference in bladder volume at micturition (BVM). These studies demonstrate that in vivo micturition changes with age in the male F344 rat. Although there were no overt urological dysfunctions observed in the aging rats, the alterations in function would indicate that there were changes in either the mechanisms controlling micturition, or changes in the musculature itself. These possibilities will be the subject of further investigations.\r"

  ".W": "Metabolic acidosis developed frequently after ureterosigmoidostomy and rectosigmoid bladder construction but has been reported rarely after the newer methods of continent urinary diversion which also employ intestinal reservoirs. We created an animal model in which to compare the metabolic effects of bladder replacement with segments of ileum or colon and the potential for reversing these derangements with nicotinic acid and chlorpromazine. One year after six dogs' bladders were replaced by colon (three) or ileum (three), all dogs appeared in excellent health and were free of urinary tract obstruction and clinical infection. Both groups of dogs were severely acidotic with diminished arterial pH and arterial and venous total CO2 concentrations although normal serum electrolytes and creatinine concentrations were maintained. Both groups of dogs absorbed approximately one half the urinary sodium, chloride and urea presented to their intestinal reservoirs. After treatment with nicotinic acid and chlorpromazine, the metabolic status of both groups of animals improved. Although nicotinic acid reduced urinary excretion of electrolytes more effectively than chlorpromazine, nicotinic acid was not more effective for reversing metabolic acidosis. When nicotinic acid was provided as an adjunct to sodium bicarbonate therapy in two animals acidosis was corrected at reduced doses of sodium bicarbonate. Based upon this work in an animal model, there does not appear to be a metabolic advantage to intestinal reservoirs which incorporate ileum versus colon. However, asymptomatic patients with normal serum electrolytes and creatinine concentrations may be acidotic. The effects of long term mild acidosis are unknown. However, if therapy is required to prevent diminution of whole body buffers or changes in bone density specific therapy with nicotinic acid or chlorpromazine may reduce the requirement for alkali for correction of metabolic acidosis.\r"

When compared to controls, neither free MTX nor liposome-delivered MTX caused significant tumoricidal activity. Heat alone did cause a slowing of tumor growth and an increase in animal survival. Because large unilamellar liposomes are known to be cleared by the liver, sixteen animals were autopsied to determine the extent of liver toxicity which may have been a result of the various treatments. No hepatotoxic effects were observed after injection of liposomes containing MTX or other experimental combinations of drug and/or liposomes.\r"

  ".W": "Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are a reliable model of nonvascularized tumor cell aggregates showing a well defined three-dimensional growth pattern and are comparable with small metastatic cancer cell complexes in blood circulation. In the present study we have established a co-culture system of multicellular bladder tumor spheroids with human endothelial cells on extracellular matrix (ECM) in order to investigate morphological and proliferative changes of endothelial and tumor cells within a defined time of cell-cell interaction. The MCTS--endothelial cell--extracellular matrix complex was observed within coculture periods from 1/2 to seven days. Morphological changes (light microscopy, scanning and electron microscopy) indicated that MCTS are not influenced by cocultured endothelial cells. The tumor cells invaded into the ECM after degradation of endothelial cells in the center of the contact zone. Endothelial cells, however, showed degenerative changes as well as a complex reaction in their proliferation activities. We could recognize an initial increase of proliferation of endothelial cells next to the MCTS. Later on, endothelial cells next to invading tumor cells showed changes in morphological polarity. The model system used has the advantage of using human tumor tissue. It distinguishes between basic cellular mechanisms like adherence, migration, DNA synthesis and proliferation in the study of the contact of tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells as an important event in hematogenous tumor spread.\r"

We have studied the effect of bethanechol on both glycolysis and high energy phosphate metabolism. The results can be summarized as follows: bethanechol administration in vitro stimulates a 30% decrease in intracellular glycogen, a 100% increase in lactic acid production, and an 80% increase in CO2 generation. Although there was a rapid and sustained decrease in the intracellular concentration of creatine phosphate, there was only a minor decrease in the intracellular concentration of ATP. There were no changes in adenine uptake or de novo ATP synthesis.\r"

Since only TCDD among these compounds was present in Agent Orange but all are present in the population of the industrialized world, it is likely that the elevated TCDD levels arose from wartime exposure. The high correlation (r = +.89) of blood with adipose tissue level suggests that there may be a mobile equilibrium between them and that blood measurement could replace adipose tissue measurement of TCDD levels, making the collection of human data less invasive.\r"

From Jan 1, 1977, to Dec 31, 1982, a total of 15,291 births (still and live) were examined, and malformations were reported to an ad hoc birth defects registry. In the most highly contaminated area, 26 births were observed. None of these infants had any major structural defect. Two infants had mild defects. The frequencies of major defects detected in the areas of low or very low contamination were 29.9/1000 and 22.1/1000, respectively. A frequency of 27.7/1000 was registered in the control area. Relative risks were calculated for specific categories of birth defects and for grouped malformations. Although the data collected failed to demonstrate any increased risk of birth defects associated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the number of exposed pregnancies was not big enough to show a low and specific teratogenic risk increase.\r"

Seventy-two percent of the sample returned to work. Education, physical activity associated with employment, severity of myocardial infarction, perception of health status, financial incentives, socioeconomic status, treatment hospital, rated social health status, locus of control, satisfaction with work, and early entry into the job force each proved to be significantly associated with return to work in independent univariate analyses. A stepwise multivariate regression analysis identified only the first four factors as important predictors of return to work. Further analyses show that given knowledge of the patients' educational level and the physical activity associated with employment, 71% of patients who returned to work were correctly classified. Return to work proved easier to predict than work disability. More knowledge is needed about the factors that are critical to a failure to resume employment after a myocardial infarction.\r"

At catheterization, left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 55%) was present in 40%. Forty-three percent of patients required urgent intervention (coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). The patients were transported by paramedic ambulance up to 99 km (less than or equal to 62 miles) without a physician in attendance. No complications occurred in patients transferred within our guidelines. We believe that seriously ill cardiac patients can be transferred safely for definitive care. A single tertiary center providing immediate access to catheterization and surgical facilities can service a large population and many community hospitals.\r"

Information was received from 189 of the US ID hospitals (94.5%) and from 160 (94%) of the Minnesota hospitals. Only 49% of the US ID hospitals and 37% of the Minnesota hospitals had an HIV antibody test-ordering policy; 47% of the US ID hospitals and 39% of the Minnesota hospitals had a specific educational program for physicians about the HIV antibody test; and 62% of the US ID hospitals and 41% of the Minnesota hospitals had an HIV autopsy policy. Marked variety existed in approaches to handling test results, obtaining patient consent, and providing risk-reduction information among the hospitals surveyed. These data suggest the need for a consensus on optimal use of HIV antibody testing at hospitals.\r"

The investigation included 274 cases diagnosed from 1935 through 1982 in residents of Rochester, Minn, and 548 matched controls selected from live-birth deliveries. Risk factor information documented prior to the last index menstrual period was obtained via medical record abstract. Univariate matched analyses revealed nine variables associated with a significantly elevated relative risk of ectopic pregnancy. Following conditional logistic regression, four variables remained as strong and independent risk factors for ectopic pregnancy: current intrauterine device use (relative risk, 13.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 120.6), a history of infertility (relative risk, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.2), a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (relative risk, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 6.6), and prior tubal surgery (relative risk, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 13.9). Theoretically, any condition that prevents or retards migration of the fertilized ovum to the uterus could predispose a woman to ectopic gestation. Further research is needed to clarify the impact of other potential risk factors in the etiology of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "A long-term effect of oral contraceptives (OCs) on breast cancer risk has been suggested as an explanation for some studies' failure to detect an association between OCs and breast cancer. To address this latency hypothesis, we analyzed data on 4714 case subjects and 4540 control subjects from the population-based Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study. No support was evident for a latent effect of OCs on breast cancer risk through age 54 years: among parous women who had cumulated more than six years of OC use before their first term pregnancy, the risk of breast cancer, relative to nonusers before first term pregnancy, was 0.6 at zero to four years after first term pregnancy (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.2 to 1.8), 0.7 at five to nine years (95% Cl, 0.3 to 1.7), and 1.1 at ten to 14 years (95% Cl, 0.3 to 3.9). Among nulliparous women with more than six years of OC use in total, the relative risk of breast cancer, by interval from last use of OCs, was 1.3 at zero to four years (95% Cl, 0.8 to 2.0), 1.1 at five to nine years (95% Cl, 0.5 to 2.0), and 0.6 at ten to 14 years (95% Cl, 0.1 to 3.7).\r"

Each condom was mounted on a hollow dildo and placed in a glass cylinder. The HIV inoculum and HIV-free medium were placed on opposite sites of the condom. Intercourse was simulated by pumping the dildo up and down in the cylinder before and after deliberate rupture of the condom. Samples for HIV culture were taken from outside and inside the condom, before and after rupture. After rupture of nonoxynol 9-containing condoms, an outside nonoxynol 9 concentration of 0.25% was reached. No condom without nonoxynol 9 leaked HIV before rupture, but after rupture HIV could be detected in medium outside of seven of ten condoms tested. In none of 20 nonoxynol 9-containing condoms could HIV be detected in outside medium after rupture. Thus, undamaged condoms provide an effective physical barrier against HIV, and nonoxynol 9 may provide an effective chemical barrier as well.\r"

Usable responses numbered 424 (35.3%); 84% were A.S.P.E.N. members 5 years or less. Currently 46% and previously 17% of respondents served on nutrition support (NS) teams. Two-thirds of the group either completed or were enrolled in a graduate program. Only one-half of the respondents had statistics and/or research methodology courses. Half the group spent no time in research, 10% gave 10-50 hr/week and nearly 80% wanted to spend more time in this activity. One-fifth were principal investigators (PI), 27% were co-investigators and 29% had collected data for others. Although 16% wrote proposals, fewer than 10% had projects approved and/or funded; co-investigators were more successful than PIs in this regard. Several (22.2%) presented research papers or posters and 36% gave seminars, case studies, or short presentations. One-fifth (20.8%) published research articles and 20.3% published other works. More than 80% expressed interest in collaborative research, perhaps because many felt they lacked skills needed to develop research designs, write proposals, analyze data, obtain funding, and get published. Most said research was not rewarded, of a low priority, and generally ignored by the dietetics department; 60.5% had great interest in research and 37.1% had adequate research opportunities. No significant differences were observed for those with graduate degrees or for members of NS teams but A.S.P.E.N. dietitians appeared to be more active in research than other dietitians.\r"

The equations produced differences in metabolic expenditure which averaged from 0.8-96 kcal/day. The largest difference produced by any two of the nine equations was 189 kcal/day. Although differences in original stoichiometric data have resulted in numerous different equations for the calculation of metabolic expenditure, these differences are not clinically important. It makes little difference which equation is used for nutritional assessment in an ICU.\r"

  ".U": "88141562\r", 
  ".W": "Endogenous and exogenous supplies of carnitine are decreased in septic patients under total parenteral nutrition, while carnitine urinary elimination is increased. But the increase of lipid role in the energetic cover requires a greater intervening role of tissue carnitine. So one may hope that in septic patients additional supply of L-carnitine would increase the catabolism of infused lipids. Twenty-eight septic patients, admitted in an intensive care unit were given parenteral nutrition (200 g of glucose, 12.5 g of N/24 hr). On the day of the study, 250 ml of Intralipid 20% (Kabi Vitrum) were administered in 4 hr. During the same period 13 patients were infused with 2 g of L-carnitine (Sigma-Tau). The remaining 15 patients constituted the control group. Basic plasma levels of triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, free glycerol, phospholipids, and ketone bodies remained within physiological limits. They increased during the lipid infusion and returned to initial values, 4 hr after the end of the infusion. Free and total carnitine levels and free/total carnitine ratio were comparable to healthy subjects' reference values. These parameters increased during L-carnitine infusion. This infusion had no effect on exogenous lipid clearance. However, it seemed to increase the uptake and the hepatic oxidation of circulating fatty acids. It invalidated the increase of lactate and pyruvate that had been noticed when lipids were solely infused.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of primary breast cancer is known to be increased in patients with previous endometrial or ovarian cancer, but the behavior of the breast cancer and the ultimate outlook for such patients is unknown. To provide data concerning these two questions, a group of 123 patients treated for breast cancer alone (Group I) served as a control for comparison with ten patients who had endometrial cancer (Group II) and six patients who had ovarian cancer (Group III) prior to diagnosis of breast cancer. The interval between the diagnosis of endometrial cancer and breast cancer averaged 4.6 yr, and between ovarian cancer and breast cancer, 5.4 yr. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer in Groups I, II, and III was 56, 66 (P = 0.05) and 56 yr, respectively. The incidence of patients with stage I, II, and III breast cancer was similar in Groups I, II, and III as was tumor size and number of metastatic nodes in each stage in each of the three groups. Average duration of follow-up after diagnosis of breast cancer was 3, 3.1, and 2.8 yr in Groups I, II, and III, respectively, with 70%, 60%, and 33% of patients living and free of either breast cancer, endometrial cancer, or ovarian cancer. Two of four deaths in Group II were due to endometrial cancer, and all four deaths in Group III were due to ovarian cancer. The remaining two deaths or recurrences in Group II were due to breast cancer. We conclude that 1) the behavior of breast cancer is similar in patients with or without previous endometrial or ovarian cancer; 2) breast cancer develops at an older age in patients with previous endometrial cancer than in patients with or without previous ovarian cancer and 3) death or recurrent cancer in patients with breast cancer and previous ovarian cancer is due to ovarian cancer, whereas, death or recurrent cancer in patients with breast cancer and previous endometrial cancer is due equally to breast cancer and endometrial cancer.\r"

IORT can induce a progressive retroperitoneal fibrosis and fibrosis of the porta hepatis in patients with resectable pancreatic carcinoma. In unresectable pancreatic carcinoma, the major expression of intraoperative irradiation with external beam irradiation is a progressive fibrosis of the pancreas with vascular sclerosis, nerve degeneration, atrophy of acinar cells, and atypical changes in the ducts of the pancreas, as well as degenerative changes of the pancreatic tumor.\r"

We describe our retrospective comparison of 179 patients who received doxorubicin containing adjuvant chemotherapy and developed recurrent breast cancer on University of Arizona Cancer Center clinical trials with 202 non-adjuvantly treated patients entered onto clinical protocols for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer during the same period. Adjuvant failures had a shorter median survival from the date of onset of recurrent disease (18 months versus 28 months, P less than 0.001), a lower response rate to initial combination chemotherapy (38% versus 69%, P = 0.001), and a high incidence of CNS involvement at the time of relapse (11%). In patients having recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, a history of prior adjuvant chemotherapy appears to identify a subgroup who will have a higher incidence of CNS involvement, a lower response rate to chemotherapy and a shorter survival with metastatic disease. These findings may help explain the failure of improved relapse free survival seen in many adjuvant chemotherapy trials to result in improved overall survival.\r"

Five (83%) patients demonstrated recurrence after initial surgery, three despite postoperative vaginal radium or external pelvic radiation. Four of the recurrences occurred in the pelvis and abdomen; the fifth was limited to the vagina. Three patients were dead of disease within three years of diagnosis, two of whom achieved clinical remission for at least one year to combination chemotherapy. One of the remaining three patients died from intercurrent disease without recurrence, and two are alive without disease after treatment for recurrence. Based on this limited experience, we believe these neoplasms should be regarded as potentially as malignant as their mixed Mullerian counterpart.\r"

Seven catheters clotted and could not be salvaged. Seventeen catheters were removed for suspected bacterial infection. Peripheral blood culture was not predictive of catheter tip contamination, while culture of blood drawn through the catheter and insertion site cultures proved most useful. Five bona fide infections were documented for an infection rate of 3.18%. This corresponds to one infection per 2,544 patient days (6.97 patient years). The mean duration of service of the catheter was 81 days with a median of 36 days. The longest duration was 707 days.

There were 6 stage I-II patients (12%) and 43 stage III-IV patients (88%). According to ethnic origin, there were 27 (55%) non-Ashkenazi Jews, 9 (18%) Ashkenazi Jews, and 13 (27%) Arabs. This distribution is different from the percentages of these ethnic groups in Northern Israel. All patients received combined cobalt 60 and 8-10 MeV electron beam radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the entire neck. Twelve stage III-IV patients received three courses of chemotherapy using bleomycin, methotrexate, and cisplatin (BMP) prior to definitive radiotherapy. The following 5-yr actuarial survival figures were achieved: all patients, 42%; stage I-II, 63%; stage III-IV, 37%; Arabs, 53%, non-Ashkenazi Jews, 47%; Ashkenazi Jews, 22%; BMP+radiotherapy, 54%; radiotherapy alone, 42%. It is concluded that there is an ethnic-related pattern of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Northern Israel. Prognosis is better in non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs with early-stage lymphoepithelioma or anaplastic carcinoma, younger than 45 yr old, and receiving more than 5,500 cGy. Chemotherapy by BMP improves initial control rates with questionable benefit to long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "Intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was given to eight patients with unresectable colorectal liver cancer and to one patient after radical hepatectomy. A subcutaneous intraperitoneal access device was implanted, and treatment consisted of continuous infusion of 1,000 mg 5-FU/d for 5 days, repeated every 6 weeks. Evaluation of treatment was performed after every two cycles of therapy. A total of 32 infusion cycles were given. The mean steady-state concentration of 5-FU was 0.56 +/- 0.04 mumol/l (mean +/- SEM), and the total body clearance was 10.0 +/- 0.71/min mean +/- SEM). The levels of 5-FU in peripheral venous blood were stable and reproducible. When incubated in whole blood at 37 degrees C the concentration of 5-FU fell rapidly and after 2 h, only 22% of the starting level remained. When kept ice-cold, 5-FU samples were stable. Patient acceptance was excellent, and the therapy was free from complications except for slight abdominal discomfort, not enough to require alleviation by analgesic drugs. Computerized tomography (CT) scan showed stationary tumor volume after two cycles of therapy in four of eight patients who could be evaluated. It is concluded that continuous intraperitoneal infusion of 5-FU produces stable and reproducible levels of the drug in peripheral venous blood, that 5-FU is degraded by blood cells at 37 degrees C, that the use of a subcutaneous access device makes the delivery easy and safe, and that the efficacy of the therapy seems to be similar to that obtained with hepatic arterial infusion.\r"

These 198 patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 99 (50%) patients in whom adequate (60 mm Hg) distal bypass was achieved and combined with somatosensory evoked potential monitoring. Group 2 consisted of 99 (50%) in whom this could not be achieved. Of the latter, four patients were excluded because of operative death in one and preexisting neurologic deficits in three. The rates of early and delayed neurologic complications were 8% and 12%, respectively, in the former and 7% and 8%, respectively, in the latter. Using the logistic regression method of statistical analysis, adjusting for the difference in patient mix, we found no statistical difference in the incidence of neurologic complications in the two groups. The incidence of false negative somatosensory evoked potential response was 13% and false positive response 67%. Localization of critical spinal arteries for reattachment was not possible. Thus, the method had no significant impact upon the prevention of neurologic deficits, which varied from mild or transient to severe and which either occurred during the operation or were delayed from 12 hours to 21 days.\r"

All patients had between one and four unsuccessful operations for benign esophageal disorders. Sixteen patients had primary motor disorders: achalasia in nine and esophageal spasm in seven. Of these patients, 11 also had recurrent gastroesophageal reflux and peptic esophagitis. Complicated reflux disease characterized by severe esophagitis, stricture, and impaired peristalsis without primary motor disorder occurred in five patients. In one patient a functionally impaired long-segment colon interposition was removed and replaced with stomach. Total thoracic esophagectomy and cervical esophagogastric reconstruction was done in all patients. The transhiatal approach was chosen for resection in 16 patients and thoracotomy was used in the other five. There was one perioperative death (5%), from massive aspiration 4 days after transhiatal esophagectomy. Other complications included transient anastomotic leak (three patients), tracheoesophageal fistula (one), recurrent nerve palsy (one), and transient hoarseness (two). Follow-up is complete between 1 and 10 years and reveals the following functional results: 12 patients good to excellent, seven fair, one poor. In this patient group in which multiple prior procedures have failed to improve severe incapacitating symptoms, we believe further attempts at hiatal reconstruction are unlikely to succeed. For this circumstance, we recommend total thoracic esophagectomy with the use of stomach as the replacement organ of choice.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the impact of coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial revascularization on survival after aortic valve replacement, we reviewed our experience with single aortic valve replacement between 1969 and 1984. Of 474 patients (mean age 62 +/- 13 years), 185 (39%) had no associated coronary artery disease, 233 (49%) had coronary artery bypass grafting, and 56 (12%) had unbypassed coronary artery disease. Early (30-day) mortality rates were 2.2%, 8.2%, and 7.1%, respectively (p less than 0.01, coronary disease absent versus present). Actuarial survival rates at 10 years were 77% +/- 4%, 41% +/- 6%, and 26% +/- 11% (p less than 0.001, coronary disease absent versus present), with 1 to 177 months of follow-up (mean 56 +/- 40). Preoperative angina (39%) did not predict the presence of coronary artery disease (61%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that early deaths were associated with advanced preoperative New York Heart Association functional class (p less than 0.001), advanced age (p less than 0.05), more extensive coronary artery disease (p less than 0.05), and lack of cardioplegic myocardial protection (p less than 0.05). Complete revascularization did not increase operative risk when coronary artery disease was present (early mortality 6.8%, p = not significant). Late deaths were strongly associated with the presence of coronary artery disease (p less than 0.001) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (less than or equal to 55%, p less than 0.01). Late cardiac mortality was most commonly attributable to sudden death (30/71, 42%), especially in the unbypassed coronary disease cohort (9/14, 64%). The actuarial rate of freedom from sudden death at 10 years was 52% +/- 17% in the unbypassed coronary artery disease group (p = 0.009), compared with 90% +/- 3% and 91% +/- 3% in the revascularized and no coronary disease patients, respectively. Thus, coexistent coronary atherosclerosis has a detrimental impact on early and late survival after aortic valve replacement. Revascularization does not increase operative risk when associated coronary artery disease is present and significantly reduces the occurrence of late sudden death. Strategies that minimize operative risk when associated coronary artery disease is present include use of cardioplegia and complete revascularization.\r"

Preoperative chemoradiation resulted in significant tumor response as measured by decreased nodal involvement and 36% incidence of no residual tumor at resection (total response) and was reflected by an improvement in resectability. Local tumor recurrence was eliminated by preoperative chemoradiation preceding resection. Distant recurrence was not reduced and remained the major cause of death. The 2-year survival rate after tumor resection alone was 33% versus 66% after preoperative chemoradiation and resection (p = 0.13). Patient survival after resection alone was predicted by pathologic extent of local disease as measured by lymph node status. In contrast, survival after chemoradiation and resection was not predicted by pathologic extent of local disease. Surgical resection appears to have been an important component of therapy, primarily because survival was improved in patients after resection of residual local disease.\r"

  ".W": "Between May 1983 and April 1986, 318 patients underwent cardiac valve replacement with the Monostrut Bjork-Shiley prosthesis. There were 136 aortic valve replacements, 128 mitral valve replacements, and 54 multiple replacements. A total of 373 valves were implanted. Associated procedures were done in 79 (25%) of the patients. Hospital (30-day) mortality rate was 5.6% (18 patients): 2.9% (n = 4) after aortic, 7.8% (n = 10) after mitrals and 7.4% (n = 4) after multiple valve replacement. Follow-up was obtained in all 300 operative survivors, for a total of 500 patient-years (mean 18 months). Actuarial survival rate, excluding operative deaths, at 4 years was 94.7% +/- 1.5% (mean +/- standard error of the mean). There were 16 thromboembolic episodes (3.2/100 patient-years). Freedom from all valve-related complications was 87% +/- 2.4% at 3 1/2 years. Neither valve thrombosis nor structural failure has been observed. Eighty percent of the patients are in New York Heart Association functional class I. Forty-two patients (26 with aortic and 16 with mitral valve replacement) underwent cardiac catheterization a mean of 6 1/2 months after the operation. In the aortic position, peak gradients were an average of 6.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. Mean systolic gradients were 12.4 +/- 6.3 mm Hg and did not increase with exercise. In the mitral position, end-diastolic gradients were an average of 2.1 +/- 2 mm Hg and mean gradients, 5.9 +/- 2 mm Hg. Discharge coefficient (estimated orifice area/geometric area) was 0.63 +/- 0.2 for the aortic and 0.53 +/- 0.2 for the mitral prostheses. Disc opening was maximal in most patients. These results indicate that the Monostrut prosthesis has a low rate of thromboembolic events, no structural failures or thrombotic obstructions and excellent hemodynamic performance, especially in the small aortic sizes (discharge coefficient for 19 and 21 mm valves, 0.77).\r"

Right atrial infusion of prostaglandin E1 in doses from 31 to 500 ng/kg/min resulted in no change in any parameters studied, including mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. Left atrial infusion of prostaglandin E1 produced dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance but no change in the slope of the relationship of left ventricular stroke work to end-diastolic length, a load-independent index of ventricular performance. In contrast to findings obtained with load-dependent parameters, these results suggest that prostaglandin E1 has no positive inotropic effect in vivo.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups: Group I (n = 14) received intermittent crystalloid cardioplegia; group II (n = 14) received intermittent blood cardioplegia; and group III (n = 14) received continuous blood cardioplegia. The groups were matched according to six previously elucidated determinants of myocardial acidosis. Measurements were made of myocardial pH, hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]), and the difference in pH units between myocardial pH and the pH of neutrality of water at the corresponding temperature (delta pHn). Throughout aortic clamping, myocardial pH in groups I and II fell significantly by 0.46 +/- 0.08 and 0.15 +/- 0.07 units, respectively (p less than 0.001) between the groups). In contrast, myocardial pH remained statistically unchanged throughout aortic clamping in group III (p less than 0.001 compared to groups I and II). Similar relationships were observed in [H+] and delta pHn during aortic clamping. During the early reflow, myocardial acidosis was observed in all three groups and delta pHn in group III increased from -0.26 +/- 0.10 at the end of aortic clamping to -0.57 +/- 0.07 during reperfusion (p less than 0.03). Patients in groups II and III required significantly less inotropic and mechanical cardiac support than patients in group I (p = 0.017). Hence, although continuous blood cardioplegia does not completely prevent acid accumulation during reflow, it provides better metabolic protection of the hypertrophied human heart than either intermittent crystalloid or intermittent blood cardioplegia.\r"

The present study was done to determine if the linear relationship between oxygen utilization and stroke work present in the ejecting heart would facilitate compartmentalization of this increased oxygen consumption into resting and working metabolic demands. Therefore, 18 canine hearts instructed for computerized acquisition of instantaneous pressure-volume data and quantitation of myocardial oxygen consumption were studied during incremental volume infusion while undergoing right heart bypass. Data acquisition before and after either 20 minutes of 37 degrees C global ischemia or 2 hours of 20 degrees C cardioplegic arrest allowed construction of stroke work versus end-diastolic volume and myocardial oxygen consumption versus stroke work relationships by least squares regression analysis. Although contractility was depressed 48% (p less than 0.01) after unprotected ischemia and was unchanged after cardioplegic arrest, neither group demonstrated a change in the efficiency of converting consumed oxygen to external mechanical work. In contrast, in both groups the oxygen utilization for unloaded contraction was comparably augmented by 21% and 16% (p less than 0.05), despite the varying ischemic conditions and disparate preservation of contractile function. These data suggest a highly linear correlation between oxygen consumption and external mechanical work that persists after ischemia and discriminates the components of postischemic energetic derangements. This model may be useful in the development and assessment of specific myoprotective strategies.\r"

Valve reconstruction was possible in 26 patients (87%), whereas in four the valve was replaced with a mechanical prosthesis. Five patients died in the hospital (16.6%), four after conservative operations and one after mitral valve replacement. There was only one late death in a child in chronic congestive heart failure. Three patients, treated conservatively, required valve replacement 2, 22, and 24 months, respectively, after the operation. Follow-up data reveal that 22 of 24 patients are asymptomatic 5 months to 15 years after operation. Two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed in 19 patients treated conservatively, 17 of whom are asymptomatic. Eleven of them have no signs of mitral regurgitation or stenosis, six show only mild mitral incompetence, and two have moderate mitral regurgitation or stenosis. Peak pulmonary artery pressure is within normal limits in all. Our results indicate that mitral valve reconstructive procedures for congenital valve dysplasia may be effective and reliable in children despite the frequent severity of valve malformation. Although no major prosthesis-related complications were observed in the present series, we believe that mitral valve repair should always be attempted in the pediatric population to avoid the drawbacks of the currently available prostheses.\r"

Infundibular septal resection facilitates intraventricular rerouting for anatomic correction of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and double-outlet right ventricle. This technique also may be used to enlarge progressively obstructive but physiologically advantageous ventricular septal defects, for example, with tricuspid atresia. Through the superior transaortic or transpulmonary approach, the landmarks of the infundibular septum are the intercoronary commissure of the aortic valve and the septal commissure of the pulmonary valve, both of which are directly above the middle of the infundibular septum. With this exposure, the infundibular septum may then be resected easily and relatively completely and a large opening created immediately beneath the semilunar valves. The feasibility of infundibular septal resection by the superior approach was assessed post mortem in 25 cases of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and in 20 autopsied cases of double-outlet right ventricle. This technique was subsequently applied successfully to enlarge the obstructive ventricular septal defect of a 2-year, 11-month-old girl with D-transposition of the great arteries. The advantages of the proposed technique include technical ease, relative completeness of infundibular septal resection, and the facilitation of intraventricular repair of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and double-outlet right ventricle.\r"

Thirty-three consecutive patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia were studied by standard techniques preoperatively, intraoperatively, and 7 to 36 days postoperatively. Standard endocardial resection was guided by intraoperative mapping in all patients. Adjuvant cryoablation was used in areas that were not accessible to excision. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the postoperative electrophysiologic study. Group I (14) were patients who still had ventricular tachycardia (failure) and Group II (19) were those who did not have ventricular tachycardia (success). On the basis of the postoperative electrophysiologic testing, the time from myocardial infarction to surgical treatment (less than 3 months) was a powerful predictor of failure of operation alone to prevent ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.01). This may indicate a different mechanism of ventricular tachycardia in this group of patients. Another possible predictor of surgical failure was three-vessel disease. The site of origin of ventricular tachycardia, the use of cryoablation, the number of morphologies, and the amount of tissue resected were not significant predictors of success or failure. The result of the postoperative electrophysiologic study was also a strong prognostic predictor of subsequent arrhythmias.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine if left ventricular venting enhances and distention impairs myocardial cooling and recovery of global and regional left ventricular function. Twenty-one pigs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and subjected to 80 minutes of ischemic arrest with the mid-left anterior descending artery occluded. Hearts were protected with multidose potassium (25 mEq/L) crystalloid cardioplegic solution supplemented with topical (4 degrees C) and systemic (28 degrees C) hypothermia. During arrest, the left ventricle was vented in seven pigs, seven pigs were not vented, and seven others had systemic pump blood infused into the left ventricle to maintain an end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg. Parameters measured included left ventricular temperature, stroke work index, compliance (end-diastolic pressure-end-diastolic volume curves) and wall motion scores (two-dimensional echocardiography). Distended hearts had the lowest mean left ventricular temperature beyond the left anterior descending arterial occlusion (10.1 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees C distended [p less than 0.025 from vented and nonvented groups] versus 14.2 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C vented versus 15.5 degrees +/- 1.2 degrees C nonvented), the highest postischemic stroke work index (0.78 +/- 0.09 gm-m/kg distended versus 0.62 +/- 0.07 gm-m/kg vented versus 0.66 +/- 0.07 gm-m/kg nonvented at end-diastolic pressure = 10 mm Hg), and the best wall motion scores (0.7 +/- 0.04 distended [p less than 0.025 from vented and nonvented groups] versus 5.5 +/- 1.80 vented versus 4.8 +/- 1.20 nonvented). Postischemic end-diastolic pressure-end-diastolic volume curves were unchanged from preischemic values in each group. We conclude that during heterogenous cardioplegic arrest, left ventricular venting offers no additional myocardial protection and may negate the beneficial effects of moderate (end-diastolic pressure = 15 mm Hg) left ventricular distention.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that elevation of coronary sinus pressure affects coronary blood flow and ventricular function was tested in this study of seven adult ewes placed under pentobarbital anesthesia. Coronary sinus pressure was elevated by partial balloon occlusion. Right atrial, left atrial, and aortic mean pressures and rate of rise of left ventricular pressure were measured. Coronary blood flow was determined with radioactive microspheres. Studies were performed at control and at moderate (15 to 20 mm Hg) and marked (30 to 35 mm Hg) elevation of coronary sinus mean pressures. Despite increase of coronary sinus pressure from a control value of 2 mm Hg +/- 1 to levels of 19 mm Hg +/- 1 and 34 mm Hg +/- 1, no significant changes were observed in right atrial, left atrial, or aortic mean pressure or rate of rise of left ventricular pressure. Both endocardial and epicardial blood flows were unaffected. The endocardial/epicardial flow ratio at moderate coronary sinus pressure elevation was significantly increased, which suggested local subendocardial vasodilation in the absence of changes in transmural perfusion. The findings suggest that isolated increase in coronary sinus pressure is not a major determinant of myocardial blood flow or ventricular performance in the normal ewe.\r"

A comparative complete two-dimensional Doppler and color flow examination was performed in group II patients 10 to 14 days postoperatively. Standard intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiograms demonstrated excellent correlation with preoperative findings and allowed assessment of valvular regurgitation or shunt when combined with echocardiographic contrast injections. However, intraoperative and postoperative two-dimensional color flow imaging was obtained more easily and rapidly and allowed recognition of more postoperative residual defects. Color flow imaging appears to be a useful method for intraoperative assessment of surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects. Twenty-one residual lesions were correctly diagnosed intraoperatively, whereas seven residual lesions were demonstrated only during later postoperative examination. This preliminary experience has also demonstrated several areas for future development and improvement of these techniques. Combined two-dimensional Doppler and contrast echocardiographic studies may allow better disclosure of residual defects.\r"

  ".W": "Adequate coronary blood flow is a major determinant for successful resuscitation from cardiopulmonary arrest. To develop compression techniques that optimize coronary blood flow, we implanted in eight dogs electromagnetic flow probes that measured circumflex coronary blood flow and ascending aortic blood flow. Micromanometers measured left ventricular and aortic pressures. Each dog was anesthetized and intubated, and the heart was fibrillated electrically. High-impulse manual chest compressions were performed with the dog in the supine position, and compression rate was varied from 60/min to 150/min. Antegrade coronary blood flow occurred primarily during artificial diastole, and there was a brief period of retrograde coronary blood flow with compression during artificial systole. Cardiac output and diastolic aortic pressure increased with compression rate, significantly augmenting peak coronary blood flow velocity. However, diastolic perfusion time decreased linearly with compression rate and limited coronary perfusion at rates greater than 120/min. As a result, net coronary blood flow during high-impulse manual chest compression was determined primarily by diastolic aortic pressure and diastolic perfusion time. Coronary blood flow was optimized in this model at a compression rate of 120/min.\r"

Cell salvage techniques resulted in a significant reduction (P less than 0.0001) in use of not only homologous blood (from a mean of 9.6 units per patient in 1982 to 3.2 units in 1984) but also fresh-frozen plasma and platelet concentrates. We found no significant difference in morbidity or mortality for the two study periods. Although the mean duration of hospitalization decreased from 11.7 days in 1982 to 9.6 days in 1984, this change was probably related to factors other than the introduction of blood conservation efforts. Thus, techniques used to decrease the amount of blood replacement needed for cardiac surgical procedures are beneficial.\r"

To assess the potential safety of shortening the duration of hospitalization after pacemaker implantation, we reviewed the complications that occurred in 100 consecutive patients after pacemaker implantation and noted the time after the implantation when the complications occurred. In our study group, all complications that necessitated invasive intervention occurred within 24 hours after the pacemaker implantation. Complications that necessitated noninvasive programming occurred as long as 72 hours after implantation, and all could have been safely corrected at the time of follow-up had the patient been dismissed at the 24-hour period. Although we do not believe that ambulatory pacemaker implantation should be routinely implemented at this time, the practice of dismissing patients at 24 hours after pacemaker implantation and scheduling subsequent outpatient follow-up seems to be safe and effective.\r"

The technique of Hedley was used for preparation of paraffin-embedded tissue into single dissociated nuclei, and the method of Vindelov was used for staining with propidium iodide. Among the 41 leiomyomas, most tumors (88%) had a DNA diploid pattern; the exceptions were two DNA tetraploid/polyploid and three DNA aneuploid samples. The DNA histograms of the 49 leiomyosarcomas (including 6 epithelioid leiomyosarcomas) were classified as follows: 9 cases (18%) exhibited a DNA diploid pattern, 29 cases (59%) had a DNA tetraploid/polyploid pattern, and 11 cases (23%) had DNA aneuploid peaks. Although DNA ploidy pattern cannot be used diagnostically to distinguish malignant from benign uterine smooth muscle tumors, the nuclear DNA ploidy pattern is an easily measured, objective determination that may have important prognostic significance for patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas.\r"

The presenting diagnoses were Cogan's syndrome, Meniere's syndrome, Dandy's syndrome without hearing loss, or progressive sensorineural hearing loss without dizziness. Because Cogan's and Dandy's syndromes were relatively uncommon, the typical high-risk clinical profile was a middle-aged patient (often female) with bilateral, asymmetric, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, with or without dizziness, and occasional systemic immune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. When a more common clinical diagnosis cannot be reached in suspicious patients, immune laboratory tests should be obtained and a trial of immunotherapy offered. Positive test results and beneficial response to therapy support a presumptive diagnosis of immune inner-ear disease.\r"

The records of 17 cases were available for detailed review. The age range was from 27 to 80 years with a female to male ratio of 12 to 5. A mandibular or paramandibular mass or swelling was the most common presenting sign. Three patients presented with mandibular metastasis prior to the discovery of the primary tumor. In the other 14 patients, the mandibular lesion appeared from 2 months to 20 years following discovery of the primary tumor. The mandibular lesion was the initial sign of distant metastatic disease in 11 of the 17 patients. Breast, lung, and colon cancer were the most common primary tumors. When presented with an isolated mandibular mass, a high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of metastatic disease. Since plain x-rays may initially be normal, technetium or CT scan may be necessary to demonstrate osseous destruction. Inferior alveolar nerve anesthesia should be considered an indication of tumor until proven otherwise. Treatment is often of a palliative nature because of the presence of widespread metastatic disease; however, surgical resection may be considered in the rare patient with a well-documented, solitary mandibular metastasis.\r"

The most common site of nerve compression is the middle-ear segment where the nerve is frequently devoid of bony covering. In five patients with facial palsy due to epitympanic cholesteatoma, a characteristic pattern of growth was recognized in which the cholesteatoma traversed the anterior epitympanum rather than taking the more common posterior route. Extension anteromedial to the head of the malleus leads to compression of the facial nerve in the region of the geniculate ganglion at the level of the middle cranial fossa floor. The most probable pathogenesis of this lesion is extension of disease along the embryologic course of either the saccus anticus or the anterior saccule of the saccus medius. Management of these lesions is surgical and may require, in addition to mastoidectomy with anterior and/or posterior atticotomy, middle fossa craniotomy and/or partial removal of the labyrinth for complete excision.\r"

  ".W": "Subjective tinnitus remains obscure, widespread, and without apparent cure. In the absence of a suitable animal model, past investigations took place in humans, resulting in studies that were understandably restricted by the nature of human investigation. Within this context, the development of a valid animal model would be considered a major breakthrough in this field of investigation. Our results showed changes in the spontaneous activity of single neurons in the inferior colliculus, consistent with abnormally increased neuronal activity within the auditory pathways after manipulations known to produce tinnitus in man. A procedure based on a Pavlovian conditioned suppression paradigm was recently developed that allows us to measure tinnitus behaviorally in conscious animals. Accordingly, an animal model of tinnitus is proposed that permits tests of hypotheses relating to tinnitus generation, allowing the accommodation of interventional strategies for the treatment of this widespread auditory disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Otologists may be reluctant to perform labyrinthectomy in unilateral Meniere's disease, fearing the later development of bilateral disease and severe hearing loss in the previously normal ear. To illuminate this issue, we reviewed audiologic records for 85 patients diagnosed as having bilateral Meniere's disease at the University of Washington Hospital from 1969 to 1986. The progression of hearing loss in each ear was noted, as well as interaural relationships. Nine patients experienced a significant reversal, in which the initially better ear surpassed the other ear in hearing deficit, but only one of these patients could at any time have been considered a labyrinthectomy candidate, according to hypothetically liberal audiometric criteria.\r"

  ".U": "88142315\r", 
  ".W": "The exposure obtained using the degloving approach is superb and the absence of resultant facial scar or deformity provides a dramatic new addition to the otolaryngologist's surgical repertoire. The advantages of the degloving technique in exposure of the midface, nasal cavities, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, skull base, and clivus have led to its increasing importance in the otolaryngology literature. Within 2 years of the technique's introduction in our department, it had been used 48 times for a wide variety of problems, including inverting papilloma, juvenile angiofibroma, chordoma and selected cases of fungal disease of the sinuses. This article describes the procedure, reports the results from a panel of 48 patients, and discusses potential complications. The authors' experience with this procedure indicates that it should become a procedure of choice for management of inverting papilloma and juvenile angiofibroma, as well as a major alternative method in many other circumstances.\r"
