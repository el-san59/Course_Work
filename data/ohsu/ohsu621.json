The rats were then tested as adults for learning, memory, emotionality, social interaction, and activity level using the T maze, water maze, handling test, home cage intruder test, and open field test. KA-treated rats learned at a slower rate in the water maze and T maze than the controls. In addition, KA-treated rats had evidence of impaired memory during spatial bias testing in the water maze. In the home cage intruder test, KA-treated animals were more submissive and less aggressive than control animals. Finally, KA-treated animals were significantly more active than control animals in the open field test. This study demonstrates that KA administration to the immature brain, in a convulsant dose, results in permanent changes in behavior, learning, and memory.\r"

Severity of audiogenic seizures in the genetically epilepsy prone rat (GEPR) is reduced by injection of norepinephrine (NE) into the lateral ventricles and by GABA in inferior colliculus. The present investigation examines the potential for raising epileptic thresholds by increasing local GABAergic or NE inhibitory activity by means of brain transplants of tissue rich in GABA or NE neurons. Two models of epilepsy were used: amygdala-kindled seizures and sound-induced seizures in GEPRs. Transplantation of embryonic cerebellar or cortical tissue to the deep prepiriform area of amygdala kindled rats transiently raised seizure thresholds in three of the nine animals. Transplantation of embryonic cerebellar or cortical tissue to the inferior colliculus or adrenal medulla tissue to lateral ventricles of GEPRs did not appreciably reduce the intensity of audiogenic seizures in these animals.\r"

Seven animals (group 1) received 1 mg/kg bicuculline to induce brief generalized seizures, and six control animals (group II) received saline. Twenty to 90 min after the end of seizure activity in group I or saline injection in group II, CBF was measured by the radioactive labeled microspheres method at three levels of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) obtained by controlled blood withdrawal within the normal range for autoregulation. In the postictal period, baseline CBF was higher in group I than in group II (85 +/- 21 vs. 48 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g, p less than 0.001). During hypotension, total CBF was positively correlated with variations of MABP in group I (r = 0.739, p less than 0.01) but not in group II. Regional CBF showed the same correlation with MABP. These data show that after seizures in piglets, the rise in CBF is associated with a persistent impairment of CBF autoregulation. These hemodynamic alterations may be relevant in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic or ischemic brain lesions.\r"

As part of a larger study on sleep and interictal activity in kindled cats, we performed sleep recordings in 11 normal cats before and after acute administration of CBZ. Epidural screws (frontooccipital) and depth electrodes (amygdala and hippocampus) were implanted bilaterally for EEG recording. Supraorbital screws and neck intramuscular electrodes were inserted for EOG and EMG. Ten days after electrode implantation, recordings were made of animals for 2 consecutive nights to assess baseline sleep patterns. Before the third night, cats received a single oral dose of 100 mg CBZ. After washout, a second similar drug administration was given before the fourth night. Recordings were scored for wakefulness, stage I and II of NREM sleep, REM sleep, number of stage shifts, awakenings, and REM onsets. The administration of CBZ produced a significant decrease in duration and percentage of REM sleep (p less than 0.001) and an increase in stage I NREM (p less than 0.05). Total sleep time was increased (p less than 0.05); awakenings were shorter (p less than 0.01), and stage I episodes were longer (p less than 0.01).\r"

Assay of MCAT in 35 24-h urine samples from patients receiving chronic phenytoin (PHT) therapy indicated that 0.3-4.0% of the daily dose could be accounted for as MCAT. The GLC assay was specific for MCAT, and provided a minimal estimate of the fraction of the PHT dose being metabolized via the catechol/MCAT route. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the amount of urinary MCAT was dependent on the quantities of both dihydrodiol (DHD) and p-phenolic (p-HPPH) metabolites. Oxidative pathways involving both DHD and p-HPPH as substrates appear to be responsible for catechol/MCAT production.\r"

In an attempt to preclude metabolic N-acetylation sterically, we investigated LY201409, an analogue possessing two methyl groups ortho to the 4-amino substituent. This structural modification successfully altered the metabolic pathway, and LY201409 displayed potent anticonvulsant activity. LY201409 antagonized maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures with ED50 values of 16.2 and 4.2 mg/kg after oral administration to mice and rats, respectively. The compound did not effectively antagonize seizures induced by a variety of chemical convulsants in rats, but did block pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. Thus, among the classic anticonvulsants, the profile of phenytoin most closely resembles that of LY201409. Studies conducted with the rotorod and horizontal screen assays in mice and behavioral studies in rats suggested that doses of LY201409 that produced CNS side-effects such as sedation or ataxia were well separated from the anti-MES doses. LY201409 was a potent, dose-dependent potentiator of hexobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice. Oral administration of 6.0 mg/kg led to a 372% increase in sleep time relative to control values. Although LY201409 is a potent and effective anticonvulsant, it is also one of the most potent potentiators of hexobarbital-induced sleep time yet described.\r"

Cases (n = 268) were selected from the Colorado IDDM Registry and the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes (Denver, CO). Two control groups were recruited, one from physicians' practices throughout Colorado (n = 291) and the second through random-digit dialing from the Denver area (n = 188). Cases were less likely to have been breast-fed than controls after adjustment for birth year, maternal age, maternal education, family income, race, and sex [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.97]. This finding was consistent for both control groups and by birth-year intervals. A greater decrease in risk of IDDM was seen among subjects who had been breast-fed to an older age (for breast-feeding duration of greater than or equal to 12 mo, adjusted OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.27-1.08). The amount of IDDM that might be explained by breast-feeding habits (population percentage attributable risk) ranged from 2 to 26%, varying according to the breast-feeding prevalence reported in other studies. Replication of this work in different populations, controlled for the strong secular trends in breast-feeding habits, is critical before the hypothesis of protection is accepted.\r"

We studied the effects of 3-wk dietary protein restriction on proteinuria and renal function in 10 insulin-dependent diabetic men with diabetic nephropathy. Patients were randomly assigned by a crossover design to 40-g low-protein diet (LPD) or usual-protein diet (UPD). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were measured by inulin and p-aminohippurate clearance at the end of each period under conditions of sustained euglycemia. Total calorie intake, body weight, serum albumin and total protein concentrations, hematocrit, blood pressure, and glucose control were similar during the two diets. Achieved protein intake was 46 +/- 3 g/day during LPD and 81 +/- 4 g/day during UPD (P less than .001). Urinary urea appearance and plasma urea were significantly lower on LPD. Median total urinary protein was reduced from 3.9 g/day (range 0.5-12.3) on UPD to 2.4 (range 0.2-9.0) on LPD (P less than .006), and there was a significant fall in the median fractional clearance of albumin from 2.0 x 10(-4) (range 0.1-90.9) on UPD to 1.0 x 10(-4) (range 0.1-51.4) on LPD and IgG from 2.1 x 10(-5) (range 0.2-238) to 1.5 x 10(-5) (range 0.1-77) (P less than .006 and P less than .02, respectively). The reabsorption rate of beta 2-microglobulin was similar on the two diets and glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and filtration fraction remained unchanged. Thus, short-term dietary protein restriction reduces diabetic proteinuria independently of blood glucose or systemic blood pressure changes by improving glomerular permselectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is known to enhance platelet sensitivity to some aggregating agents. In this study, we observed that LDL isolated from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) enhanced thrombin-induced platelet aggregation to a greater extent than LDL isolated from matched controls (P less than .01). Thromboxane B2 production during aggregation was also significantly more enhanced by LDL isolated from IDDM than by control LDL (P less than .01). There was no difference in the lipid composition (free and esterified cholesterol, total phospholipids, and triglycerides) of LDL isolated from diabetic and control subjects. In contrast, the extent of glycosylation of LDL isolated from diabetic patients was significantly greater than that observed in LDL from normal subjects (P less than .01), and a positive correlation (r = .605, P less than .01) between the degree of LDL glycosylation and the rate of platelet aggregation was observed. LDL glycosylated in vitro enhanced thrombin-, collagen-, and adenosine 5'-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation to a greater extent than control LDL (P less than .01). Although LDL glycosylated in vitro was taken up by platelets to a greater extent than control LDL (P less than .05), the lipid composition (free cholesterol and phospholipid) of platelets was not significantly changed. We postulate that an increased degree of glycosylation of LDL may enhance its uptake by platelets and lead to increased platelet reactivity to aggregating agents, probably by altering the structure of the platelet membrane. The enhancement of platelet aggregation by LDL may contribute to the accelerated development of atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus.\r"

While established-diabetic mothers were hyperglycemic for 2 wk before and throughout the pregnancy, gestational-diabetic mothers were only hyperglycemic for the second half of pregnancy. Daily insulin replacements successfully restored normoglycemia. The wet weight and protein content of control placentas increased linearly between days 14 and 21. Although placentas from diabetic animals were initially smaller, placentomegaly was found at full term. Placental glycogen concentrations were also markedly increased in all diabetic animals. These changes were largely prevented by insulin replacement. The changes in placental size during normal development and in association with the diabetic state were explained by measuring placental rates of protein turnover (in vivo). In normal placentas, protein synthetic and degradative rates progressively declined over the last week of gestation. Because synthesis rates were unchanged in placentas of diabetic mothers, it appears that the differences in placental size primarily arise from alterations in protein degradation.\r"

Measurements of fetal body weights and protein mass revealed a suppression of growth in the diabetic pregnancies, probably arising from reduced hyperplasia. Growth of the liver and skin appeared to be suppressed in proportion to the whole fetus, whereas the lung, brain, and particularly the heart were relatively well protected from growth retardation. Fetal growth during development, and its retardation in association with the hyperglycemic state, was explained by measuring the rates of fetal protein turnover in vivo. Both the protein synthetic and degradative rates gradually declined during normal development. However, in the diabetic pregnancies, fetal protein synthesis was consistently lower than control rates, whereas protein degradation increased sharply toward the end of gestation. These changes in protein synthesis and breakdown probably combine to yield a smaller fetus in the absence of normoglycemia.\r"

Nerves from animals of ages 12, 16, 22, 26, and 38 wk were incubated in vitro. Among phospholipids, the uptake of isotope into phosphatidic acid was higher at nearly all ages examined. Phosphorylation of several proteins, including the major myelin glycoprotein, P0, and the small myelin basic proteins Pr + P2, was significantly enhanced in nerves from both 12- and 38-wk-old diabetic mice. The altered pattern of protein phosphorylation, but not that of phospholipid metabolism, was similar to changes observed in sciatic nerve from streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. The relationship of the results to reported levels of myo-inositol, sorbitol, and Na+-K+-ATPase activity and to functional abnormalities in nerves of db/db mice is discussed. The findings suggest that caution should be exercised in reaching conclusions concerning which biochemical alterations observed in different animal models of diabetic neuropathy are invariably associated with the development of this disorder.\r"

In combination with other factors, older patients can develop marked problems with orthostatic hypotension--notably, certain drug regimens, some degree of underlying heart failure, or such common geriatric illnesses as parkinsonism and diabetes. Treatment regimens must be designed to minimize side effects. While aggressive pharmacologic treatment may be helpful for young patients, among the elderly physical therapy or behavioral maneuvers may promote the most benefit with least risk. The simplest first step, however, is to focus on possible iatrogenic causes and eliminate them.\r"

Four venous channels were identified in normal tissues: intraepithelial, subepithelial superficial, deep submucosal and adventitial veins. In portal hypertensive patients, giant esophageal varices formed 2 to 3 cm above the esophagogastric junction fused with numerous superficial and deep submucosal veins. Gastric varices were present in the submucosa where the left gastric venous branch penetrated the gastric wall 2 cm below the esophagogastric junction. The lower esophageal varices were classified into two types of vascular structure: palisading type in five and bar type in four. The palisading type had dilated intraepithelial channels and numerous small superficial collateral veins extending in a longitudinal arrangement. The bar type had triply dilated subepithelial superficial veins and deep submucosal veins which eroded the epithelium, and the gastric varices were present in the latter type. Our study provides evidence of the three-dimensional vascular structure of the lower esophageal varices without the necessity for tissue dissection.\r"

  ".W": "Compared with normotensive mucosa, the portal hypertensive gastric mucosa has increased susceptibility to injury by noxious agents such as alcohol and aspirin, but the mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear. Since the microvasculature of the normal gastric mucosa is an important target of injury by these agents, we studied the histologic and ultrastructural features of gastric vasculature and mucosal microvasculature in rats with portal hypertension (produced by staged portal vein ligation) and in sham-operated rats. In portal hypertensive rats, the gastric mucosa was swollen and hyperemic and the endothelial cells of mucosal microvessels had very prominent enlarged cytoplasm obstructing capillary lumina. Quantitative analysis of transmission electron micrographs demonstrated that in portal hypertensive rats the gastric mucosal capillary endothelium had significantly increased cytoplasmic area (236%), increased pinocytic vesicular area (416%) and increased capillary basement membrane thickness (143%) compared to respective parameters in sham-operated control rats. Arterioles in the muscularis mucosae and in submucosa were thickened, and submucosal veins demonstrated features of arterialization. All these findings indicate that portal hypertension produces definite microvascular changes in the gastric mucosa resulting in compromise of the capillary lumina. These changes may be the basis for the observed morphologic and functional abnormalities of the portal hypertensive mucosa and its increased predisposition to injury.\r"

All patients received glucagon at 10 ng per kg per min for 20 min, then 20 ng per kg per min for a further 20 min. These doses raised serum glucagon levels to a similar degree in both groups of patients. Serum glucose levels also rose in both groups but to a lesser degree in Class BC patients. Serum noradrenaline and adrenaline remained unchanged in both groups. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, hepatic venous pressure gradient and hepatic blood flow were measured basally and during the second glucagon infusion. None of these measurements significantly changed in either group of patients. Azygos and renal venous blood flow were measured basally and during the first and second infusions. Azygos flow increased significantly only in Group A patients: basal, 0.32 +/- 0.03 liter per min; first infusion, 0.40 +/- 0.06 liter per min; second infusion, 0.49 +/- 0.07 liter per min. Corresponding values in Group BC patients were: 0.54 +/- 0.08, 0.54 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.08 liter per min. Renal blood flow did not change significantly.

One hundred ninety-eight patients with variceal hemorrhage as shown by endoscopy were evaluated. Forty-five were excluded because of uncontrollable hemorrhage; 84 were rejected because they were poor operative risk, had portal vein thrombosis or had been previously treated with beta-blockers, sclerotherapy or surgery. The remaining 69 patients were enrolled in this prospective study. There were 43 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, 23 with cryptogenic cirrhosis and three with primary biliary cirrhosis. The severity of liver disease was assessed according to the Pugh classification: 37 patients (54%) had Pugh's score 5 to 7, 26 (38%) had 8 to 10 and six (8%) had 11 to 12. Indocyanine green intrinsic clearance was used as a probe of preoperative liver function and lidocaine systemic availability as an index of spontaneous preoperative shunting. All the patients underwent an elective end-to-side portacaval shunt. The length of minimal follow-up was 40 months. One-year survival was 76% and 5-year survival was 46%. During follow-up, 25 patients died from their liver disease and 11 patients died from various causes unrelated to their liver disease. Spontaneous chronic encephalopathy occurred in 16 patients (23%). Age, Pugh's score, active alcoholism, indocyanine green intrinsic clearance and lidocaine systemic availability were tested as prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With cytosol, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate and dopamine Km values were 17.2 +/- 4.1 and 22.4 +/- 3.5 microM. Females possessed 23 to 37% of dopamine sulfotransferase levels, per gm liver, in males. DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography resolved dopamine sulfotransferase activity to dopamine sulfotransferase I and dopamine sulfotransferase II. Dopamine sulfotransferase II comprised 79 +/- 10 or 61 +/- 18% of dopamine sulfotransferase in males or females in routine assays. 4-Methoxytyramine gave 609 or 179% of mean dopamine sulfotransferase activity with dopamine sulfotransferase I or II. Dopamine and 3-methoxytyramine were comparable substrates. Epinephrine was less effective. Mn++, Cd++, Zn++, Na+ and K+ inhibited dopamine sulfotransferase II. Mg++ activated it. Dopamine sulfotransferase II from males was purified 184 +/- 64-fold. Its Km values for 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate and dopamine were 12.7 +/- 1.5 and 47.5 +/- 6.7 microM, respectively. Its dopamine sulfotransferase mechanism was sequential. The molecular weight of dopamine sulfotransferase II was 49,100 +/- 4,000 by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. Dopamine sulfotransferase II preferred phenol to catecholamines. Dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine were its best catecholamine substrates. Adrenalectomy or castration of males led to 35 or 45% mean decreases of dopamine sulfotransferase levels, indicating adrenal and gonadal participation in control of dopamine sulfotransferase production. Testosterone had no effect in either sex, whereas estradiol led to 40% mean decreases of dopamine sulfotransferase levels in males. This suggested a role for ovaries in dopamine sulfotransferase production, supported by 55 to 102% increased dopamine sulfotransferase levels after ovariectomy. Okamoto-hypertensive males or males given hypertensogenic doses of cortisol exhibited 37 or 48% mean increases of dopamine sulfotransferase levels per gm liver. Antihypertensive spironolactone or hydralazine led to 30% mean decreases of dopamine sulfotransferase levels. Altered dopamine sulfotransferase levels after all experimental manipulations were due mostly to changed dopamine sulfotransferase II content. Dopamine sulfotransferase II is compared to other reported enzymes that sulfate catecholamines.\r"

We studied the hepatic acinar distribution of this asialoglycoprotein transport system with the ligand 125I-asialoorosomucoid using rat liver perfused in either antegrade or retrograde direction in combination with quantitative light microscopic autoradiography. Grain distribution along the acinus appeared dependent on the perfusion direction. A rather shallow zone 1 to zone 3 gradient was observed if livers were perfused in the normal direction. However, a statistically significantly steeper zone 3 to zone 1 gradient was detected in retrograde perfusions. Kinetic analysis of perfusate clearance profiles yielded a hepatic clearance of 21.6 +/- 1.3 ml per min in antegradely perfused liver. Hepatic extraction was calculated to be 60.1 +/- 7.4%. Biliary secretion of radioactivity amounted to 1.89 +/- 0.18% of the dose within 1 hr after injection and consisted of intact material (1.39 +/- 0.25%) and radioactive low-molecular-weight degradation products (0.52 +/- 0.08%), of which more than 90% could be accounted for by 125I-. Apart from a minor difference regarding biliary secretion of an unidentified glycopeptide (less than 0.1% of the injected dose), transport data for the retrogradely perfused livers were identical to those obtained with livers perfused in antegrade direction, emphasizing the functional equivalence of both groups of livers. The autoradiographic data indicate that zone 3 hepatocytes take up 125I-asialoorosomucoid more avidly than zone 1 cells. The kinetic and biochemical data indicate that further processing in the hepatocytes is virtually similar in the two zones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total activity of S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase was markedly reduced in cirrhosis (37.5% of that found in the control group). This was due to a specific reduction in the high-molecular-weight S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase in the group of cirrhotics (73.9 pmoles per min per mg protein) when compared with that observed in controls (460.3 pmoles per min per mg protein). Despite this reduction in the rate of synthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (the high-molecular-weight form of the enzyme is 15 times more active than the low-molecular-weight form at physiological concentration of substrates), the concentration of this metabolite was the same in the control group (17.3 +/- 2.6 microM) and in the group of cirrhotics (17.8 +/- 3.1 microM). To explain these findings, it is postulated that in human liver, where the concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine is lower than the Km values of a variety of enzymes that use this metabolite (around 50 to 100 microM), a reduction in the synthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine is compensated by a reduction in the rate of utilization of this molecule without affecting the intrahepatic concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Specimens were taken either by biopsy or surgery and immediately incubated with 0.1% bromodeoxyuridine solution at 37 degrees C for 45 min. After in vitro labeling, the bromodeoxyuridine taken up by the nuclei of S-phase cells was determined by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method, using an anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. The number of positive nuclei in 1,000 hepatic cells was counted, and the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index was expressed per thousand. The mean bromodeoxyuridine labeling index +/- S.D. of the cancerous portion of hepatocellular carcinoma, the noncancerous portion of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis and alcoholic liver fibrosis were 64.1 +/- 31.3, 33.6 +/- 14.4, 23.2 +/- 20.8, 9.1 +/- 6.1 and 21.6 +/- 13.0, respectively. The mean bromodeoxyuridine labeling index of the hepatocellular carcinoma cancerous portion was statistically higher than that of any other group. There was no statistical difference by the t test or the Wilcoxon test between the noncancerous portion of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, and these two groups were proved interdependent by chi 2 test (Fisher's exact test), whether they were subdivided by bromodeoxyuridine labeling index greater than or equal to 10 or not. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling index was not significantly correlated with the usual biochemical parameters such as serum AST, ALT, gamma-GTP, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, cholinesterase, albumin, and alpha-fetoprotein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes in a serum-free medium were observed by time lapse cinematography to proceed through mitotis and cytokinesis. An ultrastructural study of these cultures is presented with electron micrographs of each stage of mitosis and cytokinesis. The cultured hepatocytes begin to enter prophase about 48 hr after plating and proceed through mitosis in approximately 70 min not including cytokinesis. During this time, they remain somewhat flattened and joined to neighboring cells rather than rounding up. Both mononucleate and binucleate hepatocytes proceed through mitosis. Some mononucleate cells do not undergo cytokinesis, resulting in the formation of binucleate cells. In binucleate hepatocytes, both nuclei proceed through prophase simultaneously. Usually a single mitotic spindle with a large metaphase plate containing chromosomes from both nuclei is observed. Cytokinesis frequently occurs in binucleate hepatocytes which have a single mitotic spindle. Some binucleate cells form tripolar or 4-polar metaphase plates. In tripolar metaphases, some cells do not divide, resulting in multinucleate cells, whereas others undergo cytokinesis yielding three mononucleate cells or one binucleate and one mononucleate cell. Two mitotic spindles located perpendicularly to each other with microtubules intertwining have been observed in 4-polar metaphases. In this latter case, no cytokinesis has been observed. This study shows that both mononucleate and binucleate adult rat hepatocytes cultured in a serum-free medium in the presence of epidermal growth factor not only synthesize DNA, but progress through mitosis and often cytokinesis.\r"

This study assesses this phenomenon in terms of in vitro uptake and post-uptake modification experiments with an 125I-labeled Salmonella minnesota lipopolysaccharide. 125I-Lipopolysaccharide was added to Kupffer cells in suspension cultures under a variety of conditions. In vitro uptake of 125I-Lipopolysaccharide was not saturable up to concentrations of 33.33 micrograms per ml. Kinetics experiments performed at 16.67 micrograms per ml demonstrated that Kupffer cells were unsaturable after 60 min of incubation. The kinetics of uptake could be inhibited, however, by incubation in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled lipopolysaccharide, indicating that a component of the uptake process may be limited. Energy dependence in this process was demonstrated by incubation in the presence of 1 mM 2-deoxyglucose which inhibited 125I-lipopolysaccharide uptake by approximately 30%. Pretreatment with 7.5 x 10(-5) M colchicine had no effect on kinetics, implying no role for the cell cytoskeleton in lipopolysaccharide uptake. These results are inconsistent with a receptor-mediated process as previously suggested. Modification of internalized label has been demonstrated by changes in buoyant density in CsCl isopyknic density gradients following overnight incubation with Kupffer cells. These results indicate that Kupffer cells clear bacterial endotoxin in vitro and post-uptake degradation occurs within 20 hr of incubation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the importance of bacterial infection in the formation of free fatty acids found in brown pigment gallstones, free fatty acids and phospholipase activity in hepatic bile, with or without the presence of bacterial infection, were compared. The concentration of free fatty acids in bile with bacterial infection [0.467 +/- 0.447 mg per ml (mean +/- S.D.)] was significantly higher than when bacterial infection was absent (0.073 +/- 0.041 mg per ml; p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the composition of free fatty acids in hepatic bile when bacterial infection was present. Biliary phospholipase activity was determined by counting [14C] palmitic acid released from [14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine that was incubated with native bile. The biliary phospholipase activity was significantly higher when bacterial infection was present. Furthermore, a positive correlation (p less than 0.001) was found between the activity of biliary phospholipases and the concentration of free fatty acids in hepatic bile. Most bacterial strains isolated from bile were shown to have both phospholipase A1 and A2 activity. On the other hand, human pancreatic juice and human gallbladder epithelial cells contained mainly phospholipase A2. Since fatty acids in the gallstone are mainly palmitic acid and must have been cleaved from first position in the biliary phosphatidylcholine molecule, bacterial phospholipase A1 seems to play an important role in the formation of calcium palmitate found in brown pigment gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "A side chain derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid, 23-methylursodeoxycholic acid, was synthesized and the effect of i.v. infusion of the acid at different doses (0.75, 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mumoles per min per kg body weight over 1 hr) on bile flow, on its hepatic biotransformations and on biliary lipid secretion has been studied in bile fistula rats. The results were compared with those of ursodeoxycholic and cholic acid administered under similar conditions. 23-Methylursodeoxycholic acid is poorly secreted into bile and poorly taurine and glycine conjugated, at all infusion doses. Ursodeoxycholic acid is quantitatively recovered at low doses and recovered less at high infusion rates. Cholic acid is almost entirely recovered at all infusion doses. Ursodeoxycholic acid conjugation pattern is dependent on the dose, and glucuronidation and sulfation operate at high doses. Cholic acid is taurine conjugated at low doses; at high doses, large amounts of unconjugated bile acids are observed. Methylursodeoxycholic acid presents a delayed secretion and hypercholeresis. Ursodeoxycholic acid presents similar results at high infusion rates, possibly by reaching a high intrahepatic concentration of free form. The octanol/water partition coefficients of ursodeoxycholic acid and 23-methylursodeoxycholic acid are similar and higher than that of cholic acid. A chole-hepatic shunting of 23-methylursodeoxycholic acid may explain both the low recovery in bile and hypercholeresis and is consistent with its hydrophilicity of cholic acid, on the contrary, makes possible its high recovery in bile. The effect on biliary lipid secretion is unpredictable and affected by the dose and, in consequence, by the conjugation pattern of the bile acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of the liver as a contributory factor in the vitamin D deficiency of cholestatic liver disease has been studied in vivo in dogs with chronic bile duct ligation, whereas controls underwent diversion of the bile flow through the urinary bladder via a choledococystostomy anastomosis. The hepatic extraction of vitamin D3 was evaluated by the multiple indicator dilution technique, and the formation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was assessed by directly sampling the hepatic effluent for up to 150 min after vitamin D3 administration. The serum and hemodynamic data indicate that dogs with chronic bile duct ligation had severe cholestasis and hepatocellular injury; histologically, macronodular cirrhosis was present. Dogs with choledococystostomy anastomosis had normal livers and normal liver function. The data indicate that the absence of normal bile flow into the intestinal lumen led to a progressive depletion of vitamin D reserve in both animals with choledococystostomy anastomosis and those with chronic bile duct ligation. However, neither the hepatic fractional extraction of vitamin D3, its hepatic clearance nor its transformation into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was significantly changed by chronic bile duct ligation. The results of the present studies indicate that the hepatic handling of vitamin D3 including its C-25 hydroxylation, is well preserved in the presence of severe cholestasis. They also suggest that the state of vitamin D depletion which often accompanies chronic cholestatic liver disease can largely be accounted for by factors such as secondary malabsorption of the vitamin due to the absence of adequate amounts of bile salts in the intestinal lumen, or by other factors which seem independent of the hepatic metabolism of vitamin D.\r"

  ".W": "The development of the intrahepatic bile ducts in man was studied using an immunohistochemical technique on 56 liver specimens ranging in age from 6 weeks of gestation to 8 months after birth. On paraffin sections, two monoclonal anticytokeratin antibodies (CAM 5.2 and KL-1) that normally stain both hepatocytes and bile duct cells and two polyclonal anticytokeratin antisera that in normal adult liver stain bile ducts only were applied. For immunohistochemical staining of cryostat sections (only available from 14 weeks of gestation on), four monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against individual cytokeratin polypeptides 7,8, 18 and 19 were used. Adult human hepatocytes contain cytokeratin 8 and 18 whereas bile duct cells also express cytokeratin 7 and 19 in addition to cytokeratin 8 and 18. On paraffin sections, primitive hepatocytes were stained with monoclonal antibodies CAM 5.2 and KL-1 from 6 weeks of gestation on. On cryostat sections, they were positive with monoclonal antibodies anticytokeratin 8 and 18 from the earliest time point examined (14 weeks). From 9 weeks of gestation on, portal vein branches were surrounded by a layer of cells showing a stronger positive reaction with monoclonal antibodies CAM 5.2 and KL-1 on paraffin sections and with monoclonal antibodies anti-cytokeratin 8 and 18 on cryostat sections (only available from 14 weeks on). This layer, referred to as the ductal plate, first appeared around large portal vein branches close to the hilum and subsequently around more peripheral branches. The duct plates became duplicated over variably long segments of their perimeter, lumina appeared and tubular structures were formed. The latter gradually became incorporated in the connective tissue surrounding the portal vein, resulting in the appearance of individualized bile ducts. Ductal plate cells were stained by both polyclonal anticytokeratin antisera on paraffin sections. On cryostat sections (available from 14 weeks of gestation on), they were immunoreactive for cytokeratin 19 but negative with the monoclonal antibody directed against cytokeratin 7 until 20 weeks of gestation. From then on, weakly positive staining for cytokeratin 7 was detected, but staining intensity subsequently increased and reached the level observed in adult liver at 1 month after birth. At birth, the smallest branches of the portal vein were still surrounded by a discontinuous ductal plate. We conclude that intrahepatic bile duct cells develop from hepatocytes around branches of the portal vein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Evoked potential testing was repeated periodically in 11 patients 1 to 33 months after the initial study. Eight children had abnormal delays of the P100 peak of the visual evoked potential, and these children each had significantly higher total serum bile acid levels than did children who had normal visual evoked potentials (p = 0.002). Bilateral brainstem auditory evoked potential abnormalities consistent with conductive hearing losses were initially present in six patients. However, persistent conductive losses were found in four patients, all of whom had arteriohepatic dysplasia. Four children had mildly abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials that were due solely to a mild peripheral neuropathy. Biochemical measures of vitamin E status were not consistently associated with either normal or abnormal visual, brainstem auditory or somatosensory evoked potentials or a combination of evoked potential abnormalities, and an abnormality of one evoked potential type was not associated with an abnormality of any other. A similar lack of relationship between evoked potential results and plasma vitamin A measurement was noted. Following marked improvement in or resolution of cholestasis in four patients, the visual evoked potential became normal, but other evoked potentials did not change. Visual evoked potential improvement was greatest in two patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. This is the first report that demonstrates frequent, potentially reversible visual system abnormalities that are associated with cholestasis and cannot be attributed solely to vitamin E and/or A deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum was tested for HBsAg, anti-hepatitis B core and anti-hepatitis B surface by radioimmunoassay and hepatitis B virus DNA by direct spot hybridization. Liver tissue from Groups 2 and 3 (113 patients) was examined by Southern blot analysis using 32P-labeled hepatitis B virus DNA clone from pBR322. Controls were 21 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (14 patients with chronic active hepatitis, seven patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Serum and tissue were analyzed for hepatitis B virus DNA. Hepatitis B virus DNA was not detected in either serum or liver tissue in any of the 163 patients (Groups 1 to 3). In contrast, among the controls, hepatitis B virus DNA was present in the serum of 15 of the 21. Tissue DNA in those with chronic active hepatitis revealed 10/14 with free hepatitis B virus DNA, two with integrated sequences and two with no viral sequences. All seven patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had integrated viral DNA sequences in the tumor tissues. From these results, it appears that hepatitis B virus does not play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Levels which were not significantly different from this were found in the samples from patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis (2.1 +/- 2.0 fmoles per mg of cytosolic protein). The cytosolic estrogen receptor content in the livers of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were abstaining was 4.2 +/- 3.6 fmoles per mg of cytosolic protein, but it increased to 10.4 +/- 4.9 fmoles per mg of protein in the livers of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were drinking, to 17.3 +/- 8.7 fmoles per mg of protein in the livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis with cirrhosis and to 22.7 +/- 15.7 fmoles per mg of protein in the livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis without cirrhosis. Alcohol abuse appeared, therefore, to induce an increase in the estrogen receptor content of human liver, especially in patients who were drinking and had histological evidence of acute liver damage (alcoholic hepatitis). The increase in hepatic estrogen receptor which we have observed may be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the feminization of the liver in alcoholic males.\r"

However, factors that regulate hepatic cystogenesis have not been defined, and the effect of cyst formation on hepatic parenchymal mass has not been studied. We validated computed tomographic methods for measuring volumes from computed tomographic images using plastic-agar models and demonstrated that measured volumes were within 10% of actual volumes. The validated methods were used to measure hepatic parenchymal, hepatic cyst and kidney volumes in 25 subjects with polycystic liver disease and nine controls without autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Hepatic cyst volume varied considerably in the 25 subjects with polycystic liver disease (20 to 7,148 ml), but hepatic parenchymal volume was not altered by hepatic cysts and was similar to that of controls (polycystic liver disease vs. controls: 1,357 +/- 185 vs. 1,319 + 340 ml). Total liver volume increased linearly as cyst volume increased (slope = 1.02 +/- 0.05, r = 0.994). Nine of 18 women with polycystic liver disease had massive hepatic cysts (cyst: parenchymal volume greater than 1; range of cyst volumes from 1,354 to 7,148 ml), and the other nine had cyst volumes (20 to 399 ml) similar to men with polycystic liver disease (25 to 1,107 ml). Total kidney volume, a measure of renal cystic disease, did not correlate with either total liver volume or the volume of hepatic cysts. The data indicate that hepatic parenchymal volume is preserved in polycystic liver disease despite massive cystic involvement and that women are uniquely susceptible to massive hepatic cystic disease.\r"

These studies have suggested that the patients' antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hepatitis. In the present investigation, human liver biopsy samples were analyzed using an immunoblotting method to seek evidence for expression of halothane-induced neoantigens in humans. Sera from four patients with halothane hepatitis, which recognized halothane-induced rabbit liver neoantigens of 100, 76 and 57 kD, reacted strongly with antigens of very similar molecular weights that were expressed in livers from two patients who had died of cardiac failure following recent anesthesia with halothane. The antigens were not expressed in normal human liver or in livers from three patients who died of cardiac failure following anesthesia with agents other than halothane. The human antigens were not recognized by antibodies present in various control sera. Recognition of the 100- and 76-kD human antigens by the patients' antibodies was greatly reduced by absorption of sera with liver microsomes from halothane-exposed rabbits, but not by absorption of sera with control rabbit microsomes. These results indicate that humans exposed to halothane express liver neoantigens which are analogous to the halothane metabolite-protein neoantigens characterized previously in halothane-exposed animals.\r"

  ".W": "Taking advantage of the compulsory annual medical check-up at the Central Institute of Health, Japan National Railways, hepatitis B seromarkers were tested in male employees at work and their \"dead and alive\" status was followed for more than 6 years for their prognostic significance. Two prospective studies were carried out. In the first study, two groups (cohorts) of males age 40 to 55 years were tested in 1973 and 1978, respectively, for HBsAg and anti-HBs. The relative risk of dying from primary liver cancer in HBsAg-positive carriers (n = 126) as compared to the controls who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs (n = 5,322) was 30.03 and significantly high, whereas those positive for anti-HBs (n = 1,470) had no increased risk of dying from primary liver cancer or from other liver diseases. The follow-up period ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 years, averaging 8.5 years. In the second study, three male cohorts of the same ages were tested for HBsAg and HBeAg/anti-HBe (micro-Ouchterlony method) in 1977, 1978 and 1979, respectively. There were 513 HBsAg-positive carriers among 25,547 examinees, who were followed for an average of 7.3 (6 to 8) years. Among these HBsAg carriers, those who were positive for HBeAg on entry had the highest risk of dying from primary liver cancer (relative risk, 50.25) and from other liver diseases (78.06), followed by those negative for both (28.95 and 21.78, respectively) and those positive for anti-HBe (9.47 and 6.43) when compared with 25,034 noncarriers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and efficacy of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine in preventing hepatitis B virus infection, 199 infants born to hepatitis B e antigen-positive hepatitis B surface antigen-carrier mothers were found to be antibody to HBsAg-positive (greater than or equal to 10 mIU per ml) 2 months after the first booster of hepatitis B vaccination at age 1, and their serum HBsAg and anti-HBs were rechecked annually to ages 3 to 5. Of the nine infants whose initial anti-HBs were low (10 to 100 mIU per ml) in concentration, four (44%) were found to be anti-HBs seronegative at age 3, while none of the 127 vaccine responders with high anti-HBs levels (greater than 1,000 mIU per ml) lost their anti-HBs during the 4-year follow-up period. Also, in 63 infants whose initial anti-HBs titers were around 101 to 1,000 mIU per ml, only two lost their anti-HBs at age 4, and another two at age 5, respectively. Whether the vaccine responders lost their anti-HBs or not, no hepatitis B virus infection occurred in these vaccinees during the follow-up period. Thus, in the first 5 years of life, the protective efficacy in the high-risk infants who responded to plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine was 100%. Because of the diversity of anti-HBs response in individuals, we suggest testing anti-HBs titer in all vaccinated infants after the first booster vaccination in order to calculate the time of next booster before the minimal protective level is reached.\r"

At presentation, 12 of the 28 patients (43%) had hepatitis B virus DNA in serum, 10 (36%) had serologic evidence of hepatitis delta virus infection and 6 (21%) had no serologic markers of either hepatitis B virus replication or hepatitis delta virus infection. During follow-up, 15 (54%) patients developed active cirrhosis, including eight patients with hepatitis delta virus infection and five with hepatitis B virus DNA in serum. In seven (47%) of the 15 patients, cirrhosis developed within the first 2 years; all seven patients had bridging necrosis in the first liver biopsy, and five of these were infected with hepatitis delta virus. The remaining 13 (46%) patients did not develop cirrhosis during follow-up and showed either unchanged features of chronic active hepatitis (seven cases) or histologic improvement to chronic persistent hepatitis (five cases) or to normal liver (one case). In conclusion, the prognosis of anti-HBe-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B is poor, as 54% of the cases developed cirrhosis during a mean histologic follow-up period of 4.5 years, mainly in association with hepatitis delta virus infection or continuing hepatitis B virus replication.\r"

Three animals received identical inocula at fourth passage in order to assess individual animal variation as a factor in the course of infection and disease. Acute hepatitis delta virus infection occurred in all hepatitis B virus carrier chimpanzees as demonstrated by coincident intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen, serum hepatitis delta antigen and serum hepatitis delta virus RNA followed by seroconversion to antibody to hepatitis delta antigen. In all animals, acute hepatitis was temporally associated with hepatitis delta virus infection and was self-limited. The incubation period to hepatitis shortened with passage, whereas biochemical and histologic evidence of liver diseases increased. The marked increase in liver disease with passage was not associated with increasing markers of hepatitis delta virus replication or expression, thus indicating that adaptation to the chimpanzee by serial passage resulted in increased hepatitis delta virus virulence. The duration of hepatitis due to hepatitis delta virus infection in three chimpanzees which received the same inoculum varied from 1 to 8 months. The observations of passage adaptation and individual host variation in this experimental model of hepatitis delta virus disease parallel known pathogenic variations in human hepatitis delta virus infection.\r"

The antibody was organ specific but not species specific and was therefore called anti-liver cytosol antibody Type 1 (anti-LC1). In seven of 21 cases, no other autoantibody was found; the remaining 14 cases had anti-liver/kidney microsome antibody Type 1 (anti-LKM1). With indirect immunofluorescence, a distinctive staining pattern was observed with the seven sera with anti-LC1 and without anti-LKM1. The antibody stained the cytoplasm of hepatocytes from four different animal species and spared the cellular layer around the central veins of mouse and rat liver that we have called juxtavenous hepatocytes. The immunofluorescence pattern disappeared after absorption of sera by a liver cytosol fraction. The 14 sera with both antibodies displayed anti-LC1 immunofluorescent pattern after absorption of anti-LKM1 by the liver microsomal fraction. The anti-LC1 was found in the serum only in patients with chronic active hepatitis of unknown cause. Anti-LC1 antibody was not found in sera from 100 patients with chronic active hepatitis associated with anti-actin antibody classic chronic active hepatitis Type 1, 100 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 157 patients with drug-induced hepatitis and a large number of patients with liver and nonliver diseases. This new antibody was considered a second marker of chronic active hepatitis associated with anti-LKM1 (anti-LKM1 chronic active hepatitis) or autoimmune chronic active hepatitis Type 2.\r"

The hybridoma secreting Mab Ku-1 was constructed by fusion of 8653 myeloma cells with spleen cells isolated from a mouse immunized with nonparenchymal liver cells coated with antihepatocyte antibodies. When binding was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence on frozen sections from normal liver tissue, Mab Ku-1 showed strong reactivity with Kupffer cells but was unreactive with hepatocytes, endothelial cells, bile ducts or lymphocytes. Both resident and activated macrophages bound Mab Ku-1. Reactivity in other tissues was compatible with specificity for macrophages. In the gut, scattered cells in the lamina propria were positive, whereas epithelial cells were negative. Individual cells in the lung were reactive. In the spleen, cells in the red pulp peripheral to germinal centers bound antibody. Reactivity of Mab Ku-1 to isolated Kupffer cells correlated with endogenous peroxidase activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of components immunoprecipitated by Mab Ku-1 from detergent lysates of Kupffer cells biosynthetically labeled with 35S-cysteine and 35S-methionine demonstrated that the reactive antigen was a peptide with an apparent molecular weight of 107 kD. This rat macrophage-reactive monoclonal antibody is a useful marker for identification of macrophage populations in tissue as well as in isolated cell populations.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate its toxicity against normal vs. tumor rat hepatocytes. Isolated normal hepatocytes and tumor hepatocytes from three hepatocarcinoma cell lines, Fao, C2 (Faof1C2) and HTC, were incubated in the presence of a H2O2-generating system consisting of glucose and varied concentrations of glucose oxidase. The toxicity of H2O2 was quantified by measuring the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase activity released in the culture medium after various times of incubation. By comparison to normal hepatocytes, tumor hepatocytes exhibited an increased susceptibility to lysis by H2O2. At a concentration of 100 mU per ml, glucose oxidase induced a lactate dehydrogenase activity release of only 6.1 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- S.E.) from normal hepatocytes and of 71.0 +/- 2.9, 45.5 +/- 2.5 and 34.7 +/- 3.4% from Fao, C2 and HTC cells, respectively, after an 18-hr incubation. At a concentration of 10 mU per ml, glucose oxidase had no toxic effect to normal hepatocytes or HTC cells, whereas it induced a lactate dehydrogenase activity release of 58.7 +/- 7.6 and 51.2 +/- 5.6% from Fao and C2 cells, respectively. In addition, the time courses of lactate dehydrogenase activity release, studied with 500 mU per ml glucose oxidase, demonstrated that Fao cells, C2 cells and, to a lesser degree, HTC cells were lysed more rapidly than normal hepatocytes. The toxicity of glucose oxidase was suppressed by the addition of catalase, indicating that it was actually mediated by H2O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exclusive of primary or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma nodules, 94 nodular lesions (greater than 5 mm) were detected in 53 cirrhotic livers. They consisted of 83 large regenerative nodules and 11 dysplastic nodules. Besides some common features with those observed in the former type, the dysplastic nodules presented increased cytoplasmic basophilia, nuclear and nucleolar enlargement, nuclear crowding, occasional microacinar formation and proliferation of the hepatocytes within fibrous septa. These changes were not substantial enough to allow the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In one case, however, malignant transformation of hepatocytes was suspected because of their pattern of extranodular outgrowth. It is important to recognize these subtle abnormalities in order to define premalignant hepatic lesions. A possible connection between benign large regenerative nodules and dysplastic nodules is also discussed.\r"

Similar results have recently been reported in genetically hypertensive rats of the Milan strain. A significant inverse correlation (r = -0.43, p less than 0.001) was found between mean arterial pressure and calpain inhibitor.

There were no differences between the groups in terms of body weight, body composition, and maximal O2 consumption (VO2). At rest, there were no differences in VO2, cardiac output, stroke volume, or heart rate between the two groups, although systolic (158 +/- 13 vs 121 +/- 12 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressures (94 +/- 7 vs 79 +/- 8 mm Hg) were higher in the hypertensive subjects. The hypertensive subjects' elevated blood pressure at rest was the result of a higher total peripheral resistance. During exercise, the hypertensive subjects had a lower cardiac output and stroke volume, no difference in heart rate and VO2, higher systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, and a higher total peripheral resistance compared with their normotensive peers. The results indicate that older hypertensive persons have an altered cardiovascular response to exercise as compared with age-matched normotensive subjects. The responses also indicate that older essential hypertensive persons do not undergo excessive myocardial demands during exercise of the intensity usually prescribed in rehabilitation programs.\r"

We investigated the relationship between hypertension and pain perception by comparing the response to graded electrical stimulation of the tooth pulp, which is thought to represent an exclusively nociceptive system. The test was performed with a commercial tooth pulp tester in a large series of subjects with borderline or established hypertension and in three groups of normotensive controls: volunteers, nonhypertensive patients, and medical students with a well-established or no family history of hypertension. Subjects had to report when they started to feel pulp stimulation (sensory threshold) and when this became painful (pain threshold). Sensory and pain thresholds were obtained as means of the measurements on four healthy, unfilled teeth. Sensory thresholds were significantly higher in subjects with borderline or established hypertension than in two of the three normotensive groups (volunteers and normotensive patients), whereas no significant difference was observed between the two hypertensive groups. The results for the pain threshold were qualitatively similar but less clear and less amenable to statistical analysis because this parameter could not be determined with accuracy in a number of subjects in whom the subjective pain threshold was above the upper range of stimulation of the instrument. The association between blood pressure levels and pain perception was further confirmed by the highly significant correlation found for the overall data between mean arterial blood pressure and both thresholds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Segmental tubular handling of fluid and sodium was estimated using lithium clearance as a marker of proximal tubular reabsorption. Nifedipine did not cause any change in subjects with no family history of hypertension, but in those with one hypertensive parent there was a marked increase in effective renal plasma flow (from 644 +/- 39 to 847 +/- 42 [SEM] ml/min x 1.73 m2; p less than 0.001) and a decrease in filtration fraction (from 17.6 +/- 1.0 to 12.6 +/- 0.4%; p less than 0.001), while the glomerular filtration rate was unchanged, thus suggesting a prevailing efferent vasodilation. Sodium excretion rate (p less than 0.02) and fractional sodium excretion (p less than 0.025) increased slightly but significantly in subjects with one hypertensive parent, but not in normotensive subjects with no family history of hypertension. Lithium clearance also rose (from 29.0 +/- 2.0 to 32.8 +/- 1.9 ml/min, p less than 0.001), and the derived value of fractional proximal reabsorption diminished (from 75.8 +/- 1.0 to 71.3 +/- 1.2%, p less than 0.001). Estimated distal delivery of sodium and absolute distal sodium reabsorption both increased significantly (p less than 0.005), while fractional distal sodium reabsorption was unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Microscopic cross-sections from perfusion-fixed aortas and carotid arteries of fetal (22-day gestation) and neonatal (5-day-old) animals were examined for numbers of laminae, luminal diameter and area, and medial thickness and area. SHR had a smaller mean body weight, and luminal diameters were the same in both strains. However, medial thickness and the numbers of laminae were significantly greater in SHR at both stages. Normalized ratios of medial thickness/luminal diameter and medial area/luminal area were also greater in SHR, indicating a disproportionate size of the arterial wall relative to the luminal space. Medial area/body weight ratios were also larger for SHR, suggesting the presence of greater medial mass per unit of body weight. The data support the view that the increased mass of the hypertensive arterial system is established in SHR as early as the fetal stage.\r"

Ten patients with end-stage renal disease were studied before and immediately after HD. To dissect the possible effects of HD on plasma and red blood cell (RBC) determinants, we measured whole blood, plasma, and reconstituted erythrocyte viscosities. The latter consisted of RBC's suspended in a buffered saline solution (pH = 7.4 units). In addition, serum, electrolytes and hematocrit (HCT) were measured. The results revealed a significant rise in whole blood viscosity after dialysis. Likewise, plasma viscosity rose considerably with dialysis. However, when the RBC's were reconstituted to a constant HCT, no significant difference was noted before and after HD. As expected, body weight, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations fell while HCT and protein concentration rose with HD. A significant correlation was found between the observed rise in HCT, and dialysis-induced rise in whole blood viscosity. Likewise, the observed rises in plasma viscosity after dialysis significantly correlated with the rise in protein concentration. In addition, the change in whole blood and plasma viscosity values correlated with the degree of ultrafiltration (weight loss). In conclusion, whole blood and plasma viscosity rises with hemodialysis. The observed rise in viscosity is primarily due to hemoconcentration.\r"

At a pH of 6.0, superoxide generation was 4.07 +/- 2.56 (SD) nanomoles per million cells. With normalization of pH to 7.4, superoxide production was 19.3 +/- 7.3 (p less than 0.001). The results suggest that the unphysiologic acidity of conventional peritoneal dialysis solution has deleterious consequences on neutrophil superoxide formation.\r"

The increase in the interdialytic blood urea concentration delta c is specific for the individual patient and includes the urea generation rate, distribution volume and residual kidney clearance. By measuring delta c of the largest interdialytic interval of the week the treatment frequency and duration can be calculated. Even for larger residual clearances Kr less than or equal to 5 ml/min this calculated treatment time does not differ by more than 5 min from the result of the exact urea kinetics. In vivo estimation of the urea clearances versus blood flow for the dialyzer types used is necessary for the application of urea modelling in clinical practice.\r"

Recognizing the need for smaller as well as larger ventricles, designs with effective stroke volumes of 50, 85, 100 and 130 cc have been tested with several valve types. The pneumatically driven Utah ventricular assist device (UVAD) can be used as a total artificial heart (TAH) or ventricular assist device (VAD) by using the appropriate inflow and outflow adapters. In vitro durability testing has demonstrated ventricular lifetime beyond two years and valve lifetime to nearly one and one half years. The polymer valves have lower regurgitation than mechanical valves. Animal implantation experience includes 21 TAH implants and 16 left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantations. TAH survival ranges from 2 to 210 days. LVAD animals have lived up to 116 days before elective termination. The animal were healthy and grew normally. The devices exhibit a \"Starling's Law\" response. One TAH animal survived 72 days before successful explantation followed by transplantation. At autopsy, this animal had no renal infarcts. Hematology data has demonstrated the existance of little or no intravascular hemolysis (PF Hb less than 5 mg%). The \"Philadelphia\" version of the UVAD vacuum formed ventricles are small enough to be implanted without thrombus provoking connectors. Eight animals have received this TAH and survived up to 120 days. Vacuum forming offers a rapid and inexpensive way to produce reliable and effective total artificial hearts and valves for widespread, temporary clinical application in any size adult human.\r"

The heat exchange is accomplished by supplying cooling water from a pusher-plate driven water pump to the engine and then to the heat exchanger on the pump housing. The temperature of the interface between the blood and pump surface is of critical importance for clinically acceptable operation of the system. Temperatures were measured by instrumenting a pump housing with thermocouples and an electric heater on a mock circulatory loop. Flows were varied from 1 to 8 l/min and heat input was 20 watts. At 1.0 l/min pump flow the maximum inner surface temperature rise is 4.5 degrees C. In vitro tests were conducted to examine the effect of elevated temperature on platelete function. Both platelet aggregation and adhesion were reduced at elevated temperatures of 42 and 47 degrees C indicating a potential benefit of reduced thrombogenesis on the heated housing surface.\r"

The theoretical model allows to optimize the course of the transmembrane pressure during plasma fractionation procedure in dependence of the surface area, initial concentration of macromolecules, total volume of the feed and membrane structure. The results indicate that the surface area effect is an important factor in the operation of membrane plasma fractionation and should be considered in the design of the plasma fractionation filter.\r"

We present comparative results on short-term or definitive survival of Wistar rats which, during hemorrhagic shock due to the loss of 60 or 80% of their blood mass, were given a solution of native or modified hemoglobin, in some cases purified by ion-exchange chromatography to remove non-heme proteins, lipids, and some endotoxins. The more complex the treatment used to improve the properties and the purity of the hemoglobin solutions, the longer the animals survived. The loss of hemoglobin in the urine was greatly reduced after conjugation: after 20 h, less than 6% of the total infused.\r"

By regression analysis, no difference was found in the modified Norton scale scores for those who did and those who did not have pressure ulcers during hospitalization. Pressure ulcers developed in 67 subjects during hospitalization. The modified Norton scale was not more sensitive for older subjects than for younger subjects in this sample. The knee and lateral malleolus were the sites of the most severe pressure ulcers. Subjects who were hospitalized for longer periods had more severe ulcers. Future research is needed to more precisely determine which patients in the acute care setting are at risk for the development of pressure ulcers.\r"

This study evaluated the effect on Pao2 of five hyperinflation (tidal volume 1.5 times normal) and hyperoxygenation breaths, administered before and after each of two consecutive endotracheal suctioning passes, with use of a manual resuscitation bag (PMR-2 model). The convenience sample consisted of 32 patients with endotracheal tubes who were observed within 24 hours of coronary artery bypass surgery. After the implementation of this standard suctioning intervention, there was a significant increase in PaO2 from baseline values. Only one subject had a decrease in PaO2 (44 mm Hg) after the intervention. In addition, a clinical measure of alveolar-capillary gas exchange (PaO2/PAO2 ratio) was found to be a significant predictor of PaO2 after suctioning, accounting for 38% of the variance. The data from this study support the efficacy of administering five hyperinflation and hyperoxygenation breaths, with use of a manual resuscitation bag, before and after endotracheal suctioning in stable patients after coronary artery bypass surgery. Further study is necessary to determine the efficacy of this suctioning intervention in patients with other respiratory problems.\r"

  ".W": "Heparinized arterial catheters are commonly used in critically ill patients to monitor pressures and to collect blood for laboratory analysis. To remove the heparinized fluid used to keep these lines patent large volumes of blood are often withdrawn and discarded or calculations of tube volume must be made. Repeated violation of stopcocks may lead to contamination and infection of arterial lines. In addition, discarded blood has become an increasing concern as a source of infection for health care personnel. This study evaluates the efficacy of noncompliant arterial line tubing that contains two polymer sampling ports permanently placed at prefixed distances such that if blood is withdrawn to the distal port, undiluted arterial blood can then be withdrawn from the proximal port. Blood from arterial lines that consisted of 20-gauge catheters connected to Lab-Site tubing was withdrawn in the method suggested by the manufacturer with no removal or wasting of excess blood from the system. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) studies performed on this sample were compared with those performed on a simultaneously drawn venous sample. Regression analysis showed a correlation coefficient of 0.966 for PT and 0.935 for aPTT, demonstrating an excellent correlation for the technique. The average arterial PT was 0.12 seconds less than venous control and the average arterial aPTT was 0.49 seconds greater than control. Neither of these differences was significant. We conclude that this type of high-pressure tubing allows accurate blood samples to be obtained from arterial lines without the necessity of precise calculations or blood wastage.\r"

Critical care nurses' responses to questions about family visiting demonstrated variation in their interpretation and enforcement of visiting policies within units and among hospitals. There was overall consensus that family members should play a supportive, although nonparticipative role in the provision of care of their sick family member. More than 75% of the critical care nurses became involved with families in need of emotional support although more than one third of the respondents did not believe they had the requisite knowledge to meet families' psychosocial needs. Among the factors that most influenced critical care nurses' involvement with families were situations relating to the patient's actual or impending death and the nurses' subjective feelings (likes or dislikes) for the patient and family.\r"

Helping parents to decrease their stress is warranted so that they can function in the vital role that is therapeutic to them and their critically ill child. Many parent-supportive nursing interventions have been recommended but none has been tested in the clinical setting. A quasi-experimental design was used to study the effects of the nursing mutual participation model of care (NMPMC) on the perceived environmental stress of parents in the PICU. Thirty-three parents, experiencing the PICU for the first time, participated in the study. Sequential sampling divided the participants into two groups, control and experimental. The experimental group participated in the NMPMC, designed to be supportive to and guided by the perceived individual needs of each parent. The dependent measure was the Parental Stressor Scale: Pediatric Intensive Care Unit administered within 24 to 48 hours of PICU admission, every 48 hours thereafter, and 24 hours after PICU discharge. The results indicate that the NMPMC is helpful in alleviating parental stress, specifically the stress related to interruption in the parent-child relationship, in the PICU setting.\r"

Emergent use was defined as care obtained through unscheduled, nonroutine methods of access to health care providers. There were 15 subjects in each group; the groups had similar sex distribution and were not significantly different for percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (mean 29.8%), use of home oxygen (15 of 30 subjects), or prevalence of CO2 retention (nine of 30). Symptoms and life quality were measured by using three paper and pencil tests, the Bronchitis-Emphysema Symptom Checklist, the Sickness-Impact Profile, and the Katz Adjustment Scale for relatives. Findings demonstrated consistently more symptoms and impairment of life quality in the \"high emergent\" group. The differences reached statistical significance for irritability, anxiety, helplessness, nervousness, peripheral sensory complaints, alienation, social interaction, and emotional behavior. Discriminant analysis provided a prediction formula that yielded 80% correct prediction for the two groups.\r"

The first 103 unicompartmental cases are presented at a mean time since operation of 36 months (range 21 to 56 months). In those cases with surviving arthroplasties, pain was relieved in 96%. The full range of pre-operative flexion was maintained and flexion deformity was improved from a mean of 6.7 to 5.4 degrees. Stability and alignment were restored to normal in nearly all the knees. Absence of the anterior cruciate ligament was associated with a significantly greater incidence of failure. Six failures occurred in 37 knees lacking a normal anterior cruciate ligament (16.2%); three occurred in 63 knees with a normal anterior cruciate ligament (4.8%) (p less than 0.02). Criteria for the future selection of patients have been deduced from our experience. The operation is recommended for knees with severe unicompartmental osteoarthritis in which all the ligaments are still intact.\r"

Atlanto-axial instability was present in 15, of whom 12 were fused; three had cord involvement and all made a partial or complete recovery following fusion. Cranial settling necessitated cranio-cervical fusion in four patients; all fused, and one with myelopathy was relieved. Subaxial instability required fusion in seven cases; two postoperative deaths followed the only two anterior interbody fusions. Posterior fusion was successful in the other five, with remission of neurological compromise in the three with myelopathy and one with radiculopathy. We conclude that neurological compromise in an unstable but mobile rheumatoid cervical spine can usually be brought to remission by immobilisation alone, so decompressive procedures are unnecessary in the first instance.\r"

We found that spinal fusion protects the scoliotic spine from further deterioration during adult life except for those with severe curves and marked rotation. Fusion also significantly reduced the incidence of severe pain and allowed patients to carry out heavy physical work, but did not confer complete immunity from backache. Surgery improved the appearance, but patients were not always completely satisfied with the cosmetic result.\r"

All patients had MRI studies, whilst 29 patients also had radiculography. Both studies were evaluated without prior knowledge of the clinical signs, operative findings or the results of other imaging techniques. MRI predicted the correct diagnosis in 29 of the 33 levels explored, an accuracy of 88%. All discs proven to be abnormal demonstrated a reduced signal from the nucleus pulposus. There were two false positive results and two doubtful cases but no false negatives. Radiculography predicted the correct diagnosis in 24 of 32 levels explored, an accuracy of 75%. There were two false positive results, five doubtfuls and one false negative. The overall accuracy when both tests were considered rose to 94%. Of the remaining 12 patients all except one showed good correlation between the MRI and radiculographic findings. These results indicate that low field strength MRI is slightly better than radiculography in diagnosing lumbar disc protrusions.\r"

Outcome was assessed by the patient, by the observer and by return to work. There was 96% follow-up at two years. Correlation co-efficients varied considerably between the various measures of outcome, both patient and observer appearing to base their assessment mainly on postoperative status rather than on any change produced by surgery. The observer was influenced most by postoperative pain, disability and physical impairment. Patients were influenced most by residual physical impairment, type of surgery and proportional change in disability. Return to work was moderately influenced by postoperative disability and to a larger extent by social and work-related factors. We developed a simple formula to judge overall success or failure which accurately reproduced the combined assessment of patient and observer. If surgical audit is to be meaningful it must be based on an improved understanding of how the outcome of surgery should be assessed.\r"

All had been followed for more than seven years, and at latest review, 34 hips were dysplastic. Failure to obtain concentric reduction or its loss by migration of the femoral head within one year of reduction were the best predictors of persisting acetabular dysplasia and were best quantitated by the h/b ratio (Smith et al. 1968). The acetabular index at reduction or its decrease in the first year were not reliable predictors. Late treatment was less likely to lead to normal acetabular development, but avascular necrosis did not appear to have a significant influence. The average age at which the acetabulum stopped developing was five years, but ranged from 17 months to eight years. The failure of a dysplastic acetabulum to improve in each annual radiograph after closed reduction should lead to consideration of operation on the acetabulum.\r"

Patients aged less than 55 did better than those operated on after that age, and hips with an idiopathic or post-traumatic aetiology did considerably better than alcohol-induced or steroid-induced cases. In view of these findings we believe that in the younger adult, in the absence of metabolic bone disease or advanced joint destruction, intertrochanteric osteotomy should be considered for the treatment of osteonecrosis.\r"

At 30 degrees of knee flexion and before loads were applied the tibia occupied a more laterally rotated position if the anterior cruciate ligament had been injured. When the tibia was pulled anteriorly knees with cruciate deficiency rotated more laterally and were more abducted than normal knees. Posterior traction induced lateral rotation in the injured knee and medial rotation in the intact one. Precise knowledge of the three-dimensional instability of the anterior cruciate deficient knee may be important when the laxity is evaluated only in relation to one of the three cardinal axes.\r"

The strength of the graft after 52 weeks was only one-quarter of that of the normal ligament. Our results do not justify the use of the meniscus to replace a torn cruciate ligament.\r"

At 20 weeks 19 fractures had not yet united, but 15 of these had united by 30 weeks with conservative treatment alone. The remaining four cases were operated upon because no further progress in healing was anticipated. These findings suggest that, with regard to healing, open reduction and internal fixation is rarely justified in closed adult tibial shaft fractures.\r"

A specially designed CPM device was used. In Group A, the range by the third day of treatment was significantly greater than before manipulation or operation and this increase was maintained until the latest follow-up at an average of 24 weeks. In Group B, the pre-injury range was almost retained and thereafter there was a gradual increase. Patient compliance in the first 12 hours of CPM was relatively poorer than that described in previous reports, and in five patients treatment had to be discontinued.\r"

Pulmonary hypertension was more severe in Ps-HI and Inh + Ps. A hyperdynamic response with high cardiac index and low mean arterial pressure developed in Inh + Ps and Ps-HI from six to 18 hr, while Ps-LOW, only the cardiac index was elevated at six to eight hr. The Inh + Ps and Ps-LOW groups had equivalent pulmonary artery and aortic bacterial levels, while Ps-HI had levels approximately five times higher. All groups removed bacteria efficiently in the lungs. However, preexistent inhalation injury exaggerated the pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic response.\r"

  ".W": "Biological skin is effective in restoring the missing water vapor barrier and promoting healing in burn wounds. Its effectiveness in wound management has been limited, however, by its inherently limited antibacterial properties and the fact that it is sometimes rejected before healing is complete, even reversing previous beneficial effects. Limited availability and storage difficulties have posed further problems. Impregnation of biological skin with silver ions has been proven to provide a potent bactericidal effect directly at the wound surface. We hypothesized that aldehyde cross-linking of silver-impregnated skin would mask the histocompatibility sites from the recipient's immune system. This has been demonstrated previously with aldehyde cross-linking of allografts and xenografts, prolonging retention sufficiently to permit complete wound healing. Commercially available skin was treated with an aldehyde compound and impregnated with silver. Initial studies of this cross-linked skin for treatment of burn wounds showed average retention to be between 117 and 161 days, far exceeding that of any untreated skin. It was subsequently found that the aldehyde cross-linking permitted impregnation with higher concentrations of silver than had previously been possible--2,600 to 2,830 ppm as compared to an average of 1,020 to 1,350 ppm in previously available silver-impregnated skin. This results in a more potent, immediate antibacterial effect at the wound surface and an extended period of time-release antibacterial action before the silver is exhausted. The antibacterial properties of this aldehyde cross-linked silver-impregnated skin are effective in decontaminating even grossly infected wounds and in protecting against contamination of clean wounds from adjacent infected areas or external sources.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Purpura fulminans is a rare manifestation of meningococcemia that in its full-blown form has a predictive death value of 61%. Those patients who survive usually develop gangrenous lesions that involve skin and underlying structures, mostly of the extremities and sometimes of the cheeks. Experience with early excision and skin grafting of these lesions has generally been unsatisfactory since, due to the unique pathophysiology of the disease and involvement of the most distal branches of the cutaneous circulation, the lesions are not completely demarcated until well after complete recovery from the acute phase of the disease. Recently there was an outburst of purpura fulminans in Southern California and other parts of the country. During the months of January and February 1986 we were consulted on five cases. These ranged from two months to six years in age and consisted of two boys and three girls. One two-month-old died during the acute phase, another six-year-old remained in shock and in need of hemodynamic and respiratory support and succumbed three weeks after the onset of the disease, during which time all four extremities showed progressive necrosis. Of the three patients that survived, one three-year-old girl resolved her purpuric lesions except for small necrotic patches on the buttocks that did not require surgical intervention. The other two children were left with gangrenous lesions of the upper and lower extremities over 30% of total body surface area. One of these two patients demonstrated an electrolyte disturbance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Musculoskeletal conditioning can be accomplished in the above-ground Arjo shallow-water exercise pool.

Most importantly, its adhesive provides a strong level of shear adherence to the skin. Its backing is extensive under low forces to accommodate swelling of the underlying tissue. Its great air porosity and water transmission rates augur well for the presence of dry skin under the tape. An antistatic compound has been added to the tape that maintains its flat configuration and facilitates its application to skin. On the basis of these unique performance and handling characteristics, Proxi-Strip skin-closure tape is recommended for wound closure.\r"

  ".W": "Burn surgeons commonly employ skin staples for the application of skin grafts and to secure dressings on donor site dressings and over skin grafts. Disposable skin staplers with rotating cartridges are ideally suited for wound closure because the position of their cartridges can be manually adjusted to facilitate placement of their staples. In response to the burgeoning interest in disposable automatic skin staplers with rotating cartridges, three different models are now commercially available. This report describes the design configuration and mechanical performance of these disposable automatic staplers and their staples. Mechanical performance of these staplers and staples has been assessed by standardized tests that can be replicated in any research laboratory. On the basis of these objective design and performance parameters, the Premium stapler is recommended for wound closure. This stapler provides maximal visualization of the wound as well as the staple during its formation. It delivers the staple into the skin or wound in a manner that the cross member of the staple is above the skin or wound surface. In addition, the Premium stapler has a prepositioning mechanism that can be controlled by the surgeon with minimal force. This mechanism allows the stapler to hold its staple securely, even when its pointed legs extend beyond the delivery end of the stapler. Force required to form its staples is so low that the surgeon can staple repetitively without fatigue. Finally, the Premium stapler delivers a staple that has a uniform geometry and sharp points that can easily penetrate tissue.\r"

  ".W": "We measured intact hCG, free alpha hCG, and free beta hCG levels in amniotic fluid and maternal serum using specific monoclonal antibody-based immunoradiometric assays. Compared to maternal serum, amniotic fluid had low levels of intact hormone along with high levels of its free subunits. The mean amniotic fluid hCG level was 1 mg/L at 13 weeks, and it progressively decreased to 0.100 mg/L by the 23rd week. Amniotic fluid alpha hCG levels were highest at 15 and 16 weeks (0.340 mg/L) and rapidly declined to concentrations less than 0.050 mg/L at 21 weeks. Amniotic fluid beta hCG concentrations were about 0.200 mg/L between 13 and 16 weeks and progressively decreased until the 23rd week. In vitro stability studies of hCG and its subunits demonstrated that dissociation of hCG into its subunits was not responsible for these results. Both hCG and free subunits detected in amniotic fluid were indistinguishable from standard hCG and free subunit preparations, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of hCG and free subunits in the amniotic fluid represents secretion from the trophoblastic tissue into the amniotic fluid compartment. Furthermore, high serum hCG levels in association with low levels of its free subunits are probably the result of polarized secretion of the intact hormone from the syncytiotrophoblasts into the maternal circulation.\r"

  ".U": "89054306\r", 
  ".W": "Glucocorticoid negative feedback is exerted in at least two time domains: fast feedback (within minutes of the feedback signal) and delayed feedback (within hours of the feedback signal). Although delayed feedback is known to inhibit ACTH responses to a variety of stimuli in humans, whether there is fast feedback inhibition of the ACTH responses to such stimuli is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a pharmacological injection of cortisol sodium succinate (CORT) as a rapid inhibitor of the ACTH response to surgery in patients undergoing thoracotomy for myocardial revascularization. Thirty patients were premedicated with diazepam and induced with thiopental sodium. They were assigned to one of four groups: group I, general anesthesia was maintained with enflurane (n = 8); group II, patients were anesthetized as in group I, but received a bolus injection of 500 mg CORT within 5 s of the start of surgery (n = 7); group III, anesthesia was maintained with 50-100 mg fentanyl (FENT; n = 8); and group IV, patients were anesthetized as in group III and given CORT as in group II (n = 7). Surgery induced a large increase in plasma ACTH in group I (no CORT, no FENT); the mean plasma ACTH level was 57 +/- 14 (+/- SE) pmol/L 10 min after the start of surgery, and it peaked at 92 +/- 18 pmol/L 50 min after the start of surgery. Administration of CORT at time zero (group II) resulted in a significant but attenuated ACTH response to surgery both 10 min (36.5 +/- 9.7 pmol/L) and 50 min (42.5 +/- 7.3 pmol/L) after the start of surgery. FENT per se (group III) significantly attenuated the ACTH response to surgery (e.g. plasma ACTH was 13 +/- 5 pmol/L 10 min and 21 +/- 7 pmol/L 50 min after the start of surgery). The combination of CORT and FENT (group IV) eliminated the ACTH response to surgery at all time points. In fact, plasma ACTH levels became undetectable (less than 4.4 pmol/L) from 30-50 min after the start of surgery. We conclude that a pharmacological dose of CORT administered at the time of stimulus introduction significantly attenuated the ACTH response to the stimulus (surgery). FENT not only inhibited the ACTH response to surgery per se, but amplified the effect of CORT, such that ACTH actually declined even during a large surgical stimulus. CORT clearly attenuates the ACTH response to surgery in humans in the fast feedback time domain.\r"

SOD activity was measured by pyrogallol assay in ethanol-chloroform extracts of the thyroid homogenates. The SOD concentration in the thyroid extract was measured as immunoreactive SOD by electroimmunoassay. Endemic goiter tissues (n = 10) contained significantly lower SOD activity [mean, 1.9 +/- 1.9 (+/- SD) vs. 7.5 +/- 3.9 ng purified SOD/micrograms DNA; P less than 0.02] and concentration (mean, 0.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.5 ng SOD/microgram DNA; P less than 0.01) compared with those of normal tissues. No other pathological thyroid tissues had such consistently low SOD levels. Lactate dehydrogenase activity, a marker of cytosolic enzyme, was not lower in endemic goiter tissues than in normal tissues, suggesting that both tissues possessed functioning cells capable of producing cytosolic enzyme. Thyroid tissue from endemic goiter patients previously treated with iodized oil injection also had low SOD activity and concentration. Western blot analysis indicated that SOD protein in the endemic goiter tissue did not differ from that in normal thyroid tissue. We conclude that there is deficiency of cytosolic SOD in endemic goiter tissue. Since the deficiency of cytosolic SOD causes more prolonged exposure to oxygen free radicals, the decrease in SOD might contribute to the degenerative changes frequently found in these tissues.\r"

  ".U": "89054319\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a peptide growth factor that circulates bound to carrier proteins. One form of carrier protein (mol wt, approximately 26K) is not believed to be GH dependent, is relatively unsaturated, and modulates the cellular response to IGF-I. This study was undertaken to determine the variables that control the plasma concentration of this protein, which was measured using a specific RIA. The mean plasma 26K IGF-binding protein (IGF-BP) concentration in 15 normal fasting subjects at 0800 h was 9.4 +/- 4.4 (+/- SD) micrograms/L. The mean value in GH-deficient patients was increased to 19.5 +/- 10.1 micrograms/L (n = 60; P less than 0.05), and it was 7.3 +/- 4.3 micrograms/L in patients with acromegaly (n = 31). The GH dependency of these changes is further supported by the observation that subjects who received GH injections had a 51% reduction in their fasting values. Nutritional intake appeared to be a more important controlling variable than GH. During an overnight fast plasma 26K IGF-BP values increased approximately 4-fold in 6 normal subjects. After 2 days of fasting, the mean value in 7 obese subjects rose progressively from 6.5 +/- 2.3 to 11.7 +/- 5.4 micrograms/L (P less than 0.001), and it increased further to 19.2 +/- 5.9 micrograms/L by day 4 of fasting; after 2 days of refeeding it returned to the prefasting level of 6.8 +/- 1.9 micrograms/L. Likewise, ingestion of a standard test meal resulted in a significant decrease in mean plasma 26K IGF-BP from a fasting value of 8.4 +/- 2.9 to 5.6 +/- 2.8 micrograms/L 4 h postprandially (P less than 0.05). In summary, the plasma concentrations of the 26K IGF-I-BP fluctuate widely in response to dietary manipulation, whereas GH status appears to be a secondary controlling variable.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the factors that regulate insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), we raised polyclonal antibodies to this peptide and developed a RIA that measures IGF-II in serum or plasma samples after extraction of IGF-binding proteins by C18 cartridge chromatography. The IGF-II antiserum was highly specific, exhibiting no cross-reactivity with IGF-I or insulin at the highest concentrations tested (10(-6) mol/L). As little as 0.43 micrograms/L IGF-II was detectable, and 50% displacement of tracer occurred at 1.7 microgram/L. The serum IGF-II concentrations of normal adults [mean, 634 +/- 170 (+/- SD) micrograms/L], patients with acromegaly (570 +/- 146 micrograms/L), and patients with hypopituitarism (156 +/- 58 micrograms/L) were similar to those reported by others. In eight obese subjects injected with GH (0.1 mg/kg ideal BW, im, every 48 h for 16 days), serum IGF-II concentrations did not rise significantly, whereas IGF-I concentrations increased 67%. Sixteen normal subjects, within 15% of ideal body weight, were fasted for 5 days on two to four occasions and refed diets of differing protein and calorie contents. Their mean serum IGF-II concentration before fasting (691 +/- 26 micrograms/L) was not significantly different from that after fasting (674 +/- 21 micrograms/L) or after refeeding (641 +/- 20 micrograms/L). In contrast, their mean IGF-I concentration decreased 42% with fasting and rose with refeeding. Unlike IGF-I, serum IGF-II concentrations do not appear to be regulated by short term changes in nutritional status. It is clear from this study and others that IGF-II and IGF-I are regulated differently despite their structural homology and the similarity of their actions in vitro.\r"

We developed cytochemical bioassay for PTH based on the stimulation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate and the osteoblasts lining the metaphyseal trabeculae of rat metatarsal bones. The index of precision was 0.14 +/- 0.02 (SE) and the interassay variation was 31%. With this assay, plasma bioactive PTH levels in normal subjects and patients with primary hyperparathyroidism ranged from 0.5-18 ng/L and from 27-850 ng/L, respectively. Studies of patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type I indicated that plasma PTH bioactivity in such patients is greater in the metatarsal bioassay than in the renal bioassay; no such differences were found in normal subjects or patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

Seven children had a growth response (increase in relative growth velocity greater than 1.5 SD during the initial 6 months) to GH therapy (responders), whereas 5 failed to respond (nonresponders). No relationship was found between the pretreatment plasma IGF-I levels or their changes during therapy and the growth response. Serum PIIINP levels increased considerably in all but 3 children, after as little as 1 week of GH administration. After 5 weeks, all responders had an increase in their serum PIIINP concentrations of 40% or more, whereas the nonresponders had less or no increments. There was a close correlation between the GH-induced increase in serum PIIINP levels at 5 weeks and growth velocity after 6 months of GH therapy (r = 0.77; P less than 0.01). The correlation was even stronger with the growth velocity at 12 months (r = 0.83; P less than 0.001). The serum PIIINP response to short-term GH administration could be an early predictor of the growth response to long-term GH therapy. In contrast to plasma IGF-I, the PIIINP response may be useful both in GH deficient and non-GH deficient children.\r"

One hundred and seventy-four patients meeting these criteria were encountered during a 10-yr period, of whom 80 (mean age, 61 yr) had adequate follow-up; they did not differ significantly in any initial characteristic from the remaining 94 patients. These 80 patients were followed for 1-11 yr (mean, 46 months; median, 38 months), during which there was no change, mean or individual, in any index of PTH secretion or any of its biochemical effects and no decline in forearm bone density apart from that expected from increased age. There were 4 deaths from causes unrelated to hyperparathyroidism, and the overall death rate was not increased. The data suggest that no change occurred in either the number of parathyroid cells or secretory set-point, the 2 principal determinants of basal PTH secretion. This implies a biphasic course, with a short period of disease progression followed by a long period of disease stability. Our data support the decision to withhold surgical intervention in such patients, but to establish this as the correct policy for all asymptomatic patients will require a controlled clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Fasting decreases serum T3 concentrations by reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Whether it affects TSH and thyroid secretion is controversial. Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a secretory product of the thyroid gland. To determine if fasting might alter thyroid secretion, we measured serum Tg concentrations during and after a 4-day fast in seven normal subjects and examined its correlation with serum TSH, T4, and T3 concentrations. Serum TSH concentrations significantly decreased from a mean prefasting value of 1.55 +/- 0.19 (+/- SE) mU/L to a nadir of 0.82 +/- 0.09 mU/L (P = 0.01) after 3 days of fasting. The mean serum Tg level decreased from 30 +/- 5 to 12 +/- 3 micrograms/L (P = 0.005) and serum T3 from 160 +/- 8 (2.46 +/- 0.12) to 69 +/- 7 ng/dL (1.06 +/- 0.11 nmol/L) (P less than 0.0001) after 4 days of fasting. Serum T4 did not change significantly. Serum TSH, T3, and Tg concentrations returned to prefasting values within 3 days after initiation of refeeding. A significant correlation was found between the mean serum TSH and Tg concentrations (r = 0.77; P less than 0.05) and between the mean serum Tg and T3 concentrations (r = 0.78; P less than 0.05). The individual Pearson's correlation coefficients between serum Tg and serum T3 ranged from 0.67-0.93 and were significant (r greater than 0.70; P less than 0.05) in five of the seven subjects. In conclusion, the parallel changes in serum TSH, Tg, and T3 concentrations during fasting suggest that in addition to the well known decrease in serum T3 concentrations, decreased TSH and thyroid secretion (reflected by serum Tg) may be an adaptive response to fasting.\r"

In addition to a constant caloric and nitrogen-sufficient diet, consisting of the recommended amounts of protein and energy plus 20%, the patients received GH in dosages of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg.day for two 4-day periods (days 5-8 and 13-16, respectively). Significant increases in nitrogen retention of 1.6 (114.2) and 1.4 g/day (100 mmol/day), respectively, occurred compared with that in the control periods. No difference was found between the two GH dosages, but the nitrogen-retaining effect of the higher dose appeared to last for several days after its administration was stopped. Plasma insulin-like growth factor I levels rose during both treatment periods. No important disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism occurred. Body weight increased 2.3 kg during each treatment period, probably due to water retention. We conclude that even during more than adequate nutritional intake, low GH doses cause considerable nitrogen retention in underweight adults.\r"

Immunoglobulins isolated from a pool of serum obtained during the postabortion period neutralized the activity of both hCG and LH in an in vivo bioassay, and the binding affinity of the antibodies toward both hormones was high. When menses were resumed, there was a considerable reduction of the affinity toward LH. The variations in antibody titers and/or affinities can explain the sequence of fertilization, abortion, anovulatory period, and normalization of menses.\r"

The earliest significant hCG rise was detected at day 7 post insemination for a partially hatched blastocyst, with hCG levels increasing 50-fold following blastocyst attachment to the surface of the culture vessel. Secretion of hCG was amplified by the addition of serum. There was no significant free alpha hCG or beta hCG secretion between days 6-12. We conclude that hCG production depends on the pathway of cytotrophoblast differentiation and commences with the appearance of the G1 phase in embryonic cells at the late blastocyst stage.\r"

These included normal livers and livers affected by chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma. Four of the cases of cirrhosis showed liver cell dysplasia. The mean numbers of NOR sites in normal, cirrhotic, and carcinomatous livers were significantly different: adenoma had similar mean counts to those in chronic active hepatitis (CAH). There was no overlap between the ranges of NOR counts in normal, cirrhotic, and malignant liver specimens. Where cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were present in the same specimen, the AgNOR counts were higher in the carcinomatous than cirrhotic areas. To investigate the prospective value of the method a further seven biopsy specimens were studied; in these it had not been possible to decide on a diagnosis between normality and cirrhosis or cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In all seven specimens a repeat biopsy or necropsy gave results as predicted by AgNOR staining. It is therefore proposed that quantitation of staining for NOR-associated proteins is a diagnostically useful method in liver disease.\r"

A range of reactivity was seen in tumours from most sites. No distinctive results were identified for a particular site of origin. Some patterns of consistent positivity or negativity for the panel of antisera used were seen, however, which if applied to metastatic deposits have the potential to assist prediction of the site of origin. These results also imply that immunohistological reactivity should be considered in the selection of a tumour marker for serological monitoring.\r"

Flow cytometry and immunohistology were used on paraffin wax embedded archival material for the analysis of DNA ploidy and detection of class II antigens, respectively. A close association was found between class II antigen expression, detected by monoclonal antibody CR3/43 (antimonomorphic DR, DP, DQ) present in 23 of 50 (46%) melanomas and unfavourable clinical course (p less than 0.005, by log rank test), but no such association was found for DNA ploidy. It is suggested that immunohistology for MHC class II antigen expression may help to predict the behaviour of nodular melanomas whereas the prognostic value of DNA ploidy is more limited. The finding that class II positive cells are found predominantly in melanomas with a substantially increased risk of metastases has implications both for concepts of tumour heterogeneity and host immunity.\r"

Intraplacental choriocarcinomas can give rise to both maternal and fetal metastases during pregnancy, and it is suggested that such lesions also serve as an origin for those choriocarcinomas which follow a term pregnancy.\r"

Only when albumin excretion was expressed as a fractional clearance was the urinary excretion significantly increased in the third trimester compared with the first trimester (p less than 0.05), although it was still not significantly different from that in the non-pregnant control group. Excretion of retinol-binding protein was significantly increased during all three trimesters of pregnancy (p less than 0.01 in each case) and more so in the second and third trimesters than in the first. It is concluded that the increased total protein excretion that has been described during pregnancy is not explained by an increased excretion of albumin which remains essentially normal. In contrast, the tubular absorption of proteins is decreased.\r"

In the second, sections taken at necropsy from 23 patients with chronic renal failure in whom plasma oxalate had been measured before death were examined. Though plasma oxalate concentrations ranged between 6 and 116 mumol/l (four to 78 times greater than the upper limit of the reference range), no extrarenal deposits of oxalate were found in either study. Renal deposition of oxalate was associated with a plasma oxalate concentration of greater than 20 mumol/l. This study gives no support to the suggestion that hyperoxalaemia of the degree seen in patients with the type of chronic renal failure that is not due to primary hyperoxaluria confers an appreciable risk of extrarenal oxalosis.\r"

To ascertain whether function of C4 is also impaired both its haemolytic activity and its concentration were measured in 34 insulin dependent diabetics, 15 non-insulin dependent diabetics, 20 healthy subjects, and 12 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for insulin dependent diabetes. C4 function was measured by a radial immune haemolytic assay, and C4 concentration by laser nephelometry. Both measurements were significantly lower in insulin dependent diabetics (C4 function: median 47%, range 4-100%; C4 concentration: 0.22 g/l, 0.10-0.38 g/l) than in non-insulin dependent diabetics (67%, 33-138%, p less than 0.01; 0.27 g/l, 0.16-0.50 g/l, p less than 0.02) and controls (74%, 33-138%, p less than 0.01; 0.27 g/l, 0.18-0.40 g/l, p less than 0.03). C4 function and concentration were lower in both diabetic (48%, 12-100%; 0.17 g/l, 0.08-0.31 g/l) and non-diabetic twins (47%, 12-100%; 0.17 g/l, 0.07-0.36 g/l) than controls (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.01). Thirteen (38%) of the insulin dependent diabetics had a reduction in either C4 function or concentration, but in only five were both features reduced. Values of function and concentration were strongly correlated in both diabetic and non-diabetic twins (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001; r = 0.92, p less than 0.001). These results show defects in C4 function and concentration in insulin dependent diabetes, which--being present in the non-diabetic co-twin of diabetics--may represent a genetic predisposition to the disease.\r"

Although some of the highest concentrations of lactoferrin were detected in fluids from keratocysts, there was no significant difference between lactoferrin concentrations among the three groups. Neutrophil elastase was detected in 20 of 24 samples tested, 22 of which also contained lactoferrin. Immunocytochemical localisation of both lactoferrin and elastase was confined to neutrophils infiltrating cyst walls. These results suggest that lactoferrin in fluid from odontogenic cysts is derived from infiltrating neutrophils and that its presence in aspirated fluids is not a useful diagnostic marker for odontogenic keratocyst.\r"

Thirteen of these were false negative results, however, which represented 10% of all the samples with definite bacteriuria. Additional time was required for the screening test which reduced potential savings in manpower. Overall, we found costs to be slightly increased.

Both in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody CCH2 labelled all \"owl's eye\" cells intensely and, in addition, nuclei of some morphologically normal cells. Quantitative evaluation of the results showed that in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry with CCH2 were considerably more sensitive than purely morphological analysis, particularly in tissues with only a few cells infected by CMV. It is further shown that immunohistochemistry with CCH2 detected a higher figure of CMV infected cells than in situ hybridisation. In conclusion, both in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry are rapid, sensitive, and specific methods for CMV detection. For routine purposes, however, immunohistochemistry seems to be more suitable.\r"

This procedure, the saponification/selective periodate oxidation/borohydride reduction/alcian blue pH 2.5/periodic acid Schiff (KOH/PA*/Bh/Ab 2.5/PAS) method, uses a selective oxidation step to remove the PAS positivity of sialic acid; thus only neutral sugars stain positively with PAS, and acidic sugars (O-sulphate esters and carboxyl groups) stain with alcian blue. This differs from the KOH/Ab/PAS technique which stains sialic acid residues with both alcian blue and PAS. Applying the KOH/PA*/Bh/Ab 2.5/PAS technique to the study of cyclical changes of human cervical mucins, a decreased neutral:acidic sugar ratio in the secretory phase mucins compared with those of the proliferative phase was found. This difference was not seen with KOH/Ab/PAS staining in the same cases. The techniques and reagents used in this procedure can be easily applied in a clinical histopathology laboratory.\r"

Independent of the type of diabetes, serum laminin concentrations in patients without nephropathy or with early renal damage as assessed by microalbuminuria were comparable with those of the control subjects. Patients with macroproteinuria or with renal insufficiency had significantly increased serum laminin P1 concentrations.

Acantholytic acanthoma was typically an asymptomatic, keratotic papule or nodule. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 87 years (median 60 years); the ratio of men to women was 2:1; the most frequent clinical diagnosis was keratosis; and half of the growths were on the trunk of the body. Histologically, the lesions showed hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and acanthosis. Acantholysis was an outstanding finding in all cases; the patterns resembled pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus vegetans, superficial pemphigus, or Hailey-Hailey disease, but no patient had evidence of any of these disorders. The term acantholytic is used because acantholysis is the outstanding histologic feature in these neoplasms; acanthoma was chosen because the growths are benign tumors of epidermal keratinocytes. The relationship of acantholytic acanthoma to acantholytic blistering disease is similar to that of solitary lichen planus-like keratosis to lichen planus and epidermolytic acanthoma to bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma.\r"

Two of 44 patients tested with cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) had 21-hydroxylase deficiency, whereas two other patients had hyperprolactinemia caused by pituitary tumors. Hyperandrogenism was defined as an increase in any of the plasma androgens (testosterone, non-sex hormone-binding globulin bound testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, or dihydrotestosterone) and was noted in 42 of the 109 patients studied (38.5%). Of these 42 patients, 11 were ovulatory with no evidence of clinical hirsutism, 13 were ovulatory and hirsute, and 18 had oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea with or without hirsutism with confirmatory evidence of polycystic ovarian disease. Patients with diffuse alopecia may demonstrate hyperandrogenism, even in the absence of hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea.

Iontophoresis of salt-free, 4% lidocaine, with and without epinephrine, delivered to the skin from a receptacle with a semipermeable membrane, and with the use of a current-controlled electrical system, resulted in effective anesthesia of the skin for cauterization of \"spider\" veins. Fourteen subjects received 32 treatments. Sixteen paired areas of spider veins were anesthetized with iontophoresis of lidocaine and with lidocaine plus epinephrine 1/50,000. The duration of anesthesia with lidocaine averaged 14 minutes; relief of pain was complete in 9/16 treatments, adequate in 6/16, and inadequate in 1/16. Lidocaine plus epinephrine supplied anesthesia for 56 minutes; relief of pain was total in 14/16 treatments and adequate in the remaining two. Thus iontophoresis with the use of selected local anesthetic and iontophoretic equipment provides adequate conditions for cauterization of spider veins, a procedure poorly served by conventional local anesthesia.\r"

Although the patient had been previously treated unsuccessfully for 5 years with topical administration of a potent corticosteroid, with cryotherapy, and with surgical procedures, the disease continually recurred. A course of interferon alpha resulted in a significant clinical improvement of the lesions, a histologically verified decrease of plasma cell infiltrate, and the disappearance of the antigen of herpes simplex virus that had been detected before treatment by direct immunofluorescence staining of the lesion. This clinical course demonstrates the effectiveness of local injections of interferon alpha into those lesions with vulvitis circumscripta plasmacellularis that did not previously respond to conventional therapy. Therefore an implication exists that herpes simplex virus infection may be one of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

In both patients this form of discoid lupus erythematosus did not respond to conventional therapies, which included topical steroids, intralesional steroids, prednisone, quinacrine hydrochloride, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, colchicine, and dapsone. Both patients were then treated with azathioprine. One patient dramatically improved with azathioprine, worsened each time the azathioprine was stopped or reduced, and responded again to the reinstitution of therapy. The other patient began taking azathioprine 8 months ago and has also experienced relief of her symptoms. These cases suggest that discoid lupus erythematosus principally involving the palms and soles is difficult to treat with conventional medication and that azathioprine, which appears to be useful, should be tried after the failure of other therapies.\r"

Procedures performed during the study period included 1,609 diagnostic catheterizations, 933 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties and 199 percutaneous balloon valvuloplasties. Overall, the mortality rate was 0.28% but ranged from 0.12% for diagnostic catheterizations to 0.3% for coronary angioplasty and 1.5% for balloon valvuloplasty. Emergency cardiac surgery was required in 12 angioplasty patients (1.2%). Cardiac perforation occurred in seven patients (0.2%), of whom six were undergoing valvuloplasty, and five (2.5% of valvuloplasty attempts) required emergency surgery for correction. Local vascular complications requiring operative repair occurred in 1.9% of patients overall, ranging from 1.6% for diagnostic catheterization to 1.5% for angioplasty and 7.5% for valvuloplasty. Although the complication rates for diagnostic catheterization compare favorably with those of previous multicenter registries, current overall complication rates are significantly higher because of the performance of therapeutic procedures with greater intrinsic risk and the inclusion of increasingly aged and acutely ill or unstable patients.\r"

Success was defined as final diameter stenosis less than 70% and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade greater than or equal to 2. Nine clinical variables and 15 angiographic variables were assessed. Seventy-nine percent of patients were men; the mean age was 56 +/- 11 years, and 54% of patients also received thrombolytic therapy. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 46 +/- 11%, and 18 patients (6%) were in cardiogenic shock. Angioplasty success in the infarct-related artery was achieved in 240 patients (80%). In 177 total occlusions (TIMI flow grade less than or equal to 1), the success rate was 75.7% and success was independently predicted by 1) an ejection fraction greater than 30% (p = 0.001); 2) no arterial bend greater than or equal to 45 degrees at the site of angioplasty (p = 0.008); and 3) no triple vessel disease (p = 0.014). In 144 subtotal occlusions (TIMI flow grade greater than or equal to 2), procedural success was achieved in 84.7% and was predicted by 1) absence of thrombus greater than 5 mm (p = 0.023), and 2) absence of other stenoses greater than or equal to 50% in the same artery (p = 0.043), whereas patency without further emergency intervention was achieved in 71.7% and was predicted only by patient age less than or equal to 60 years and absence of cardiogenic shock.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the patients who did not develop significant ST segment depression or angina during the predischarge test, the symptom-limited test also remained negative in 91.5 and 91.9% of the patients, respectively. Similar results were obtained with ST segment elevation and the systolic blood pressure response during the two exercise tests with only 2.1 and 11.4% changing from normal to abnormal, respectively. Discriminant function analysis was done to predict the occurrence of coronary events (unstable angina, reinfarction, cardiac failure, cardiac death) with use of the data from the exercise tests together with other clinical and investigational data. The jackknife method correctly classified 71.9 and 71.4% of the patients with the data from the predischarge exercise test and symptom-limited test, respectively. Combining the data from the two tests improved the overall predictive accuracy to only 75.0%. It is concluded that the routine performance of a symptom-limited test 6 to 8 weeks after infarction does not reveal any significant additional information in those patients who have undergone a predischarge low level exercise test. Thus the 6 to 8 week test should be restricted to selected patients after myocardial infarction.\r"

Among normal subjects, mitral leaflet and annular dimensions tended to be larger compared with body size or left ventricular size in women than in men. Mitral leaflet billowing was observed in 24 (50%) of 48 patients with mitral prolapse and 0 of 35 normal subjects (100% specificity). The 24 patients without leaflet billowing had greater systolic expansion of the mitral anulus (p less than 0.0001) than did normal adults or patients with leaflet billowing (41 +/- 14% versus 27 +/- 12% and 22 +/- 11%, respectively) and a significantly lower body mass index (p less than 0.005 versus normal group). The ratio of anterior plus posterior mitral leaflet length to end-systolic annular diameter was lower in patients with prolapse without leaflet billowing than in normal subjects (1.09 +/- 0.12 versus 1.19 +/- 0.15, respectively, p less than 0.01) or patients with leaflet billowing (1.21 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.05). Among 35 relatives with mitral prolapse in the families of 23 patients with prolapse, the pattern was the same as in the proband in 31 (89%) (p less than 0.000002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The majority of studies generating normal echocardiographic reference values for left ventricular dimensions have been based on blindly performed M-mode measurements, and there are no previous reports based on two-dimensional echocardiography that provide a comprehensive analysis of the two-dimensional measurements from infancy to old age. This report presents the results of analyzing the left ventricular internal dimensions from cross-sectional echocardiographic studies on 268 normal healthy subjects (none were hospitalized for any reason) whose ages ranged from 6 days to 76 years. The mean data are reported as functions of body surface area and, in addition, the variance is modeled as a function of body surface area to provide an accurate and clinically useful determination of normal limits and to model changes in the cardiac dimensions and in their variance representing normal growth and development. The data fit well to the exponential growth model (r values 0.85 to 0.95). Variance about the central values also depended significantly on body size; that relation is represented effectively by a quadratic function of body surface area (r values 0.82 to 0.98). The model parameters allow calculation of normal limits at any desired level of confidence. Areas determined by hand planimetry have significantly greater variance compared with variance of linear dimensions, and also compared with variance of cross-sectional area using ellipses generated from the anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions. This implies that either biologic variations in the amount of infolding or errors in freehand planimetry constitute a significant source of variance; this may be remedied by filtering out high frequency oscillations of contour. There is no significant difference in midnormal values and confidence limits for corresponding dimensions measured from orthogonal views. Furthermore, the anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions of the left ventricle superimpose at each body size, consistent with circular cross section for normal subjects throughout growth and development. The data presented should comprise a useful set of reference standards for interpretation of cross-sectional echocardiograms.\r"

  ".W": "Regional left ventricular work is a more precise indicator of function than is simple shortening fraction. Regional work of the ventricle normalized to a unit volume of myocardium (RWM) is given by the following equation: RWM = - intergral of sigma d[ln(1/H)], where sigma is the mean wall stress and ln(1/H) is the natural logarithm of reciprocal of wall thickness. This method has been previously validated in animal experiments and it is now extended to the clinical setting for the first time. In 10 normal subjects and 6 patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction, ventricular minor axis and wall thickness were measured by echocardiography and recorded simultaneously with high fidelity left ventricular pressure. Then, regional work of the interventricular septum and of the posterior wall of the left ventricle was calculated from the measured pressure and dimension data. In normal subjects, regional work of the septum and posterior wall was 6.1 +/- 1.7 and 7.0 +/- 1.8 mJ/cm3, respectively; the average of the septal and posterior wall regional work multiplied by the left ventricular myocardial volume correlated well (r = 0.93) with the total mechanical work done by the entire left ventricle. In patients with anteroseptal infarction, septal regional work was greatly reduced (0.6 +/- 1.7 mJ/cm3), compared with posterior wall regional work in the same patients (6.1 +/- 1.8 mJ/cm3). This simple method can be applied clinically in assessing the functional state of different regions of the myocardium.\r"

However, its application to human cardiac studies requires precise spatial localization without significant contamination from other tissues. Using image-selected in-vivo spectroscopy (ISIS), a technique that allows three-dimensional localization of the volume of interest, 12 subjects were studied to determine the feasibility and reproducibility of phosphorus-31 spectroscopy of the human heart. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a commercial 1.5 tesla system to define the volume of interest. Phosphorus-31 spectra were obtained from the septum and anteroapical region of the left ventricle in 10 studies. Relative peak heights and areas were determined for high energy phosphates. The mean phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate ratio was 1.33 +/- 0.19 by height analysis and 1.23 +/- 0.27 by area analysis. Duplicate measurements in four subjects showed a reproducibility of less than or equal to 10% in three of the subjects. All spectra showed significant signal contribution from the 2,3 diphosphoglycerate in chamber red cells without evidence of skeletal muscle contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of image-guided phosphorus-31 spectroscopy for human cardiac studies and indicate the potential of this technique to study metabolic disturbances in human myocardial disease.\r"

To investigate this hypothesis, the effect of dichloroacetate, a drug that decreases lactate formation by increasing pyruvate oxidation, on the maximal exercise performance of 18 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (25 +/- 9%) was examined. Exercise tests after parenteral dextrose (control) and dichloroacetate were performed 1 week apart. The sequence of interventions was randomized in a double-blind manner. Dichloroacetate decreased blood lactate at rest (control 8.0 +/- 2.5 versus dichloroacetate 5.6 +/- 2.9 mg/dl), throughout exercise and at peak exercise (control 26.0 +/- 14.3 versus dichloroacetate 19.4 +/- 10.8) (all p less than 0.05). In contrast, dichloroacetate had no effect on exercise time (control 15.2 +/- 6.0 versus dichloroacetate 15.9 +/- 6.2 min) or peak exercise oxygen consumption (control 1,280 +/- 498 ml/min versus dichloroacetate 1,312 +/- 530 ml/min) (both p = NS). In six subjects, dichloroacetate also had no effect at peak exercise on leg blood flow (control 2.8 +/- 1.1 versus dichloroacetate 3.0 +/- 0.6 liters/min) or femoral oxygen vein saturation (control 12.7 +/- 4.1% versus dichloroacetate 12.5 +/- 5.7%). These data suggest that intramuscular lactate accumulation is not responsible for muscular fatigue during exercise in patients with heart failure.\r"

In contrast, a normal signal-average ECG was associated with inducible tachycardia in only 1 (3%) of 31 individuals (p less than 0.005).

During long-term follow-up, 2 (15%) of the 13 patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who were treated with electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmics therapy died suddenly; the remaining 11 patients (85%) are alive 15 +/- 10 months after electrophysiologic testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that orthostatic stress shortens the right ventricular effective refractory period by reflex activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Twelve patients undergoing electrophysiologic testing for standard clinical indications were studied. After a full electrophysiologic study, patients underwent graded lower body negative pressure before and after administration of either propranolol (0.2 mg/kg intravenously) in Group I or atropine (0.035 mg/kg intravenously) in Group II. Before the addition of drugs, lower body negative pressure produced decreases in systolic blood pressure and significant increases in sinus rate. The effective refractory period shortened from 214 +/- 8 (mean +/- SEM) to 206 +/- 7 ms at -40 cm H2O and to 197 +/- 4 ms at -60 cm H2O lower body negative pressure. After propranolol, Group I patients had no change in right ventricular effective refractory period despite similar changes in sinus rate and systolic blood pressure. In group II patients, atropine did not alter effective refractory period responses to lower body negative pressure. Thus, reflex adjustments to orthostatic stress result in shortening of right ventricular effective refractory period mediated by way of beta-adrenergic mechanisms. These findings constitute the first evidence that sympathetic influences mobilized by the body can directly modulate ventricular electrophysiologic changes.\r"

At baseline, prevalence rates of major ECG abnormalities were higher in women than in men, with age-adjusted rates of 12.9 and 9.6% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Minor ECG abnormalities were more common in men than in women (7.3 versus 4.5%, p less than 0.01). Both major and minor ECG abnormalities were associated with an increased risk of death from coronary heart disease, all cardiovascular diseases and all causes. The strength of these associations was greater in men than in women. When baseline age, diastolic pressure, serum cholesterol, cigarettes smoked per day, diabetes and use of antihypertensive medication were taken into account, major abnormalities continued to be significantly related to each cause of death in both genders with much larger adjusted absolute excess risk and relative risk for men than for women. In multivariate analyses, minor ECG abnormalities contributed independently to risk of death in men, but not clearly so in women. The results indicate the independent association between ECG abnormalities and mortality from coronary heart disease, all cardiovascular diseases and all causes, with greater relative significance in middle-aged United States men than women.\r"

Right septal endomyocardial biopsy specimens from nine patients (four men and five women with a mean [+/- SD] [corrected] age of 36.3 +/- 14.4 years) with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and mitochondrial skeletal myopathy were studied. Three patients had atypical retinal pigmentation. An atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction defect was observed in five patients. A pacemaker was prophylactically implanted in one patient because of abnormal conduction distal to the His bundle. Ultrastructural investigations revealed mitochondriosis in many heart muscle cells and an increased variability of mitochondrial form and size in all patients. In seven patients, 0.4 to 2.1% of all examined myocytes contained exclusively abnormal mitochondria. Three main types were observed: huge, mainly round mitochondria with concentric cristae; large, round or oval mitochondria with transverse or curved cristae; and small, vacuolated mitochondria. The volume density of myofibrils was reduced (41.9 +/- 11.1 compared with the normal value of 56.5 +/- 2.5 volume density [in percent], p less than 0.01) in these myocytes. Increasing numbers of vacuolated mitochondria correlated significantly with a reduction of myofibrils (r = -0.64, p less than 0.01). The data suggest that the ventricular myocardium of most patients with complete and even incomplete Kearns-Sayre syndrome is affected by disseminated mitochondrial cytopathy.\r"

All paramedic-transported patients were managed according to a standard chest pain protocol with use of prophylactic lidocaine and, as needed, treatment for sinus bradycardia, hypotension and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. There were no specific interventions for supraventricular tachyarrhythmia or hypertension. All patients were treated under similar in-hospital protocols. Percent mortality in patients with hypotension, the highest risk subgroup in the control phase, was significantly lowered with paramedic-level care (69 versus 10%, p = 0.01). Patients with hypertension, a relatively low risk subgroup during the control phase (16% mortality), were also at lower risk during the paramedic phase (10% mortality). In fact, there was no mortality in either study phase for patients with an initial systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mm Hg. During the combined study phases, patients with normotension and tachycardia demonstrated a tendency toward higher percent mortality (33%) than either patients with normotension without tachycardia (10%) or those with hypertension and tachycardia (6%). Although the overall percent mortality was reduced by 24% (from 21 to 16%), this decrease was largely due to the improvement of patients with hypotension. Investigation into the feasibility of prehospital interventions for the high risk patient with acute myocardial infarction normotension and tachycardia appears warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with recurrent sustained symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (43 patients) or ventricular fibrillation (7 patients) resistant to a mean of 2.8 + 1.4 antiarrhythmic drugs were treated with sotalol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and 45 underwent invasive electrophysiologic testing before and after sotalol therapy. The arrhythmia became noninducible in 10, was slower and hemodynamically well tolerated in 12 and was poorly tolerated in 23. Four patients were empirically treated with long-term administration of oral sotalol as were 21 patients who either had noninducible arrhythmia (10 patients) or had hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia (11 patients). In these 25 patients treated with long-term administration of sotalol, there was no recurrence of ventricular tachycardia in the group with noninducible arrhythmia, whereas 37% of patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia had new ventricular tachycardia or sudden death. Programmed ventricular stimulation with up to three extrastimuli proved to be an excellent predictor of drug efficacy and a good predictor of inefficacy. A positive prior response to amiodarone was not a reliable indicator of a positive response to sotalol. Side effects included those attributed to both beta-adrenergic blockade as well as proarrhythmic effects. The latter were observed in two of four patients with a QT interval greater than 600 ms. Sotalol was found to be effective therapy for a subset of patients with ventricular tachycardia unresponsive to type IA drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial imaging with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile was investigated as a means to assess myocardial infarct size during coronary occlusion and to quantify the extent of salvaged myocardium after coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion. Open chest dogs underwent either a permanent coronary artery occlusion (Group 1, n = 16) or a 2 h occlusion followed by reperfusion (Group 2, n = 15). Animals in both groups were killed 48 h after occlusion. During coronary occlusion, 23 of the 25 dogs that survived the coronary occlusions had abnormal myocardial scintigrams. The scintigraphic perfusion defect size correlated well with the pathologic infarct size (r = 0.85 and 0.95 by planar and tomographic imaging, respectively). The planar scintigraphic defect size, but not the tomographic defect size, overestimated the pathologic size. The planar scintigraphic defect size observed during coronary occlusion was markedly reduced 48 h after reperfusion (24.8 +/- 12.8% to 10.6 +/- 9.7% of the left ventricle, p less than 0.003). The uptake of technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile in the ischemic myocardium increased significantly 48 h after reperfusion (p less than 0.003) and correlated with the increase in regional myocardial blood flow, as assessed by radioactive microspheres (r = 0.83, p less than 0.01). Thus, myocardial imaging with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile allows reliable demonstration of the presence of acute infarction, estimation of infarct size and quantification of the extent of salvaged myocardium after coronary reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of normal hearts have revealed a variety of intrinsic connective tissue structures that surround and interconnect myocytes and ventricular mural layers. Among these structures, springlike coiled perimysial fibers, arrayed parallel to myocytes in the interstitial space, have been described in papillary muscle and ventricle. To evaluate the role of the coiled perimysial fibers under perturbed conditions, rat ventricles were filled with barium-gelatin under different pressures and fixed, and then the myocardium was impregnated with silver to visualize the connective tissue. Ventricles were filled at 30, 70 and 100 to 120 mm Hg. The coiled perimysial fibers were studied for their orientation, stretch, integrity and relation to sarcomere length. The coils were noted to embed within the fibrous anulus and to knot into an umbilical-like mass at the apex, thus anchoring them at both ends of the ventricle. They underwent focal straightening even at 30 mm Hg, with generalized straightening and disruption at the highest pressure; changes were most pronounced in the midventricle. Sarcomeres were maintained below 2.2 micron at 30 and 70 mm Hg of cavity pressure in regions of coiled perimysial fiber stretch; only with fiber disruption at 100 to 120 mm Hg were sarcomeres significantly lengthened. Other findings included connective tissue disruption between ventricular wall layers that allowed slippage of myocytes and mural thinning. These observations suggest that coiled perimysial fibers may act as a buffer to protect myocytes from damage under the effects of high cavity pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic effects of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists were assessed in the reserpinized guinea pig ventricular myocardium. Both bunazosin (1 to 3 x 10(-7) M), a new alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and yohimbine (1 to 3 x 10(-7) M), another adrenoceptor antagonist, suppressed the transient depolarization and triggered activity induced by a train of rapid stimuli in the solution containing low potassium ion (K+), high calcium ion (Ca2+) and strophanthidin (1 to 5 x 10(-7) M). Bunazosin (3 x 10(-6) M) abolished the facilitatory effect of hypoxia on beta-adrenoceptor mediated abnormal automaticity. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the antiarrhythmic properties of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, their electrophysiologic effects on the fast and slow action potentials were investigated. Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (bunazosin, yohimbine and phentolamine) suppressed the slow response in a dose-related manner. The voltage-dependent block and use-dependent block of the maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of action potentials by bunazosin (10(-5) to 10(-4) M) and yohimbine (10(-6) to 10(-5) M) were studied. The analysis of the onset and recovery kinetics from the use-dependent block of drugs showed that both bunazosin and yohimbine act as slow kinetic drugs. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists seem to have an antiarrhythmic effect through the inhibition of fast sodium ion (Na+) and slow Ca2+ currents of the cell membrane independently of blockade of myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".U": "89054646\r", 
  ".W": "The cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster develops genetically determined cardiac necrosis that invariably leads to premature death from congestive heart failure or arrhythmia. This hamster is a valuable model of human disease because it has many features in common with clinical dilated, congestive cardiomyopathy. Previous studies have shown that therapy for several weeks with the calcium channel blocking drug verapamil or the alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking drug prazosin can prevent myocardial necrosis due to microvascular spasm. Other investigations have demonstrated the positive effects of verapamil in the early stages of disease. It is not clear, however, whether continued treatment can prevent the long-term expression of the cardiomyopathy or whether the disease is genetically predetermined. To address this question, hamsters were treated with oral verapamil for 7 to 8 months during the necrotizing, compensatory hypertrophy and early failure stages of disease. Analysis of myocardial pathologic and biochemical variables demonstrated that continuously treated animals were generally similar to unaffected control hamsters; discontinuous therapy led to partial protection. These findings demonstrate that virtually complete prevention of this hereditary disease is feasible; these results may have important implications for the treatment of human cardiomyopathy.\r"

Seventy-two patients with a posteroseptal accessory pathway underwent epicardial mapping before operative ablation. The earliest epicardial activation occurred at the posterosuperior process of the left ventricle in all patients. Dissection of the posteroseptal region (right atrial-left ventricular sulcus) resulted in permanent loss of preexcitation in 69 patients and failure to abolish preexcitation permanently in 3. At reoperation in two patients, preexcitation was abolished by discrete cryoablation of the left side of the interatrial septum near the AV node approached through the atrial septum in the normothermic beating heart. At reoperation, one patient had extensive AV node dissection. All patients have had permanent loss of preexcitation. The vast majority of posteroseptal accessory pathways (\"typical\") are epicardial and ablated by dissection of the posteroseptal region. Rarely, posteroseptal accessory pathways are \"atypical\" in that they are intraseptally located near the AV node on the left atrial endocardial surface.\r"

Monitoring after the administration of thrombolytic therapy should focus on arrhythmias, hemodynamic problems, recurrent ischemia and bleeding. The role of early cardiac catheterization to detect patients who have unsuccessful thrombolysis or who require mechanical revascularization procedures is under active investigation. The design of the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) 5 study, which addresses the role of acute interventional catheterization in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction, is described.\r"

For black subjects, rates of death from asthma increased from 1.8 in 1979 to 2.5 in 1984; for white subjects, from 1.1 in 1979 to 1.4 in 1984. Age-adjusted rates of death from asthma increased from 1.9 in 1979 to 2.8 in 1983 and 2.6 in 1984 for black subjects, and from 0.8 to 1979 to 1.0 in 1984 for white subjects. Rates for other minority groups have been lower than rates for white subjects. A modest increase in prevalence of asthma among black subjects is insufficient to account for their much higher rate of death from asthma. Increases in rates of death have occurred in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in all regions of the country and in all but a few states. At least half the deaths from asthma have occurred at hospitals: this proportion did not change from 1979 to 1984. Increases in deaths from asthma have occurred in several other countries as well. Other reviews of deaths from asthma have implicated undertreatment and delays in treatment with bronchodilators and adrenal corticosteroids as factors contributing to death. High rates of death among black subjects suggest underutilization or lack of accessibility of health care. The large proportion of deaths that have occurred at hospitals suggests delays or other inadequacies of treatment at hospitals.\r"

Negative predictive indices were generally good for all reagents, whereas positive predictive indices were generally poor and showed considerable variation (0% to 79%) between commercial sources. Under the conditions of the study, skin test reagents from two companies showed slightly better agreement with double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge results than did reagents from the third company. However, with known lot-to-lot variations in extract potency and intrapatient variation in skin test results, these differences probably are not of clinical significance.\r"

The RIA was carried out with a Sepharose-myorelaxant solid phase and anti-IgE 125I-labeled IgG. The results corresponded to the percentage of labeled anti-IgE bound on the solid phase. The RIA with Sepharose-alcuronium and Sepharose-choline was estimated positive from determination with normal sera (n = 12) when bound IgE was greater than 1.0% and 1.5%, respectively. The RIA and IDR were positive in 43.5% and 75%, respectively, of the cases, with a concordance of 66%. One test at least was positive in 79.4% of the cases. No correlation was found between IgE seric levels and the RIA nor between the cutaneous sensitivity and the RIA. Cross-reactivity with Sepharose-choline and Sepharose-alcuronium was observed in 50%, and it was demonstrated by IDR in only 34.2%. The RIA demonstrated the specificity of IgE to quaternary ammonium compounds as myorelaxant drugs.

We compared the duration of H1-receptor blockade by two tricyclic antidepressants, doxepin (the most potent antihistamine) and desipramine (the least potent antihistamine), in a single dose, double-blind, noncrossover study. After baseline prick test with histamine phosphate 1:1000 by Multitest (Lincoln Diagnostics, Decatur, Ill.), the suppression of cutaneous histamine-induced wheal-and-flare responses were measured daily for 7 days in 33 healthy volunteers who were randomly administered a single 25 mg dose of oral desipramine or doxepin. Significant differences in the suppression of the wheal-and-flare responses to histamine between the two drugs were noted (p less than 0.05) during the first 3 days. Desipramine suppressed the wheal for 2 days and flare for 1 day. Doxepin suppressed the wheal for 4 days and flare for 6 days. Our results suggest doxepin should be withheld for at least 7 days before allergy skin testing.\r"

The development of a late asthmatic response was accompanied by an increase in airway histamine responsiveness that was significant when it was compared with the airway histamine responsiveness after the control challenge at 3 hours (p less than 0.01), 24 hours (p less than 0.01), and 48 hours (p less than 0.02), with recovery at 2 weeks after allergen inhalation. The 3-hour changes in airway responsiveness occurred independently of changes in airway caliber and correlated with the magnitude of the subsequent late response (r = 0.86; p less than 0.001). These results suggest that the tissue events (possibly airway inflammation) that underlie the late asthmatic response may occur before this response becomes clinically apparent.\r"

Results of crossed immunoelectrophoretic studies showed major differences in antigen content between commercial preparations. IFAWBE and IFAV RAST-inhibition testing showed that no commercial extract had equivalent inhibitory activity to the reference IFAWBE. Reference IFAWBE reached 50% inhibition of IFAWBE and IFAV RAST at 52 and 492 micrograms/ml, respectively. IFAV gave 50% inhibition of IFAWBE and IFAV RAST at 5.9 and 58 micrograms/ml, respectively. Of the commercial extracts, only those from one supplier were able to reach 50% inhibition of the reference IFAWBE RAST, and no commercial extract from any supplier was able to reach 50% inhibition of IFAV RAST. Analysis of inhibition slopes and intercepts confirmed that there were both qualitative and quantitative differences among the commercial extracts and the reference IFAWBE and IFAV. Our findings suggest possible reasons why some individuals fail to respond to testing or immunotherapy with IFAWBE and show the urgent need for standardization of allergenic extracts for diagnosis and treatment of imported fire ant sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a major feline allergen, Fel d I. The specificity of the antibodies for Fel d I was demonstrated by a modified crossed immunoelectrophoretic procedure. These antibodies were used in affinity purification and depletion. Fed d I was eluted from the affinity matrix at a low pH. It was tested in serologic and biologic assays. Results of both the RAST and the histamine release test with affinity-purified Fel d I confirmed that it is a very potent allergen for the majority of patients allergic to cats. In the extract depleted with the monoclonal antibody, the ratio Fel d I/cat albumin was reduced by a factor of 20. With this depleted extract, 18 of 25 patients showed a reduction greater than 50% of the bound anti-IgE in the RAST compared with the RAST with crude cat extract. In the histamine release test with cells from two patients, the activity of the depleted extract was reduced by factors of 30 and 40, respectively. Depletion of Fel d I by polyclonal antibodies resulted in a reduction of the ratio Fel d I/cat albumin by a factor of 330. In the RAST, a reduction of the IgE response greater than 50% was found in 23 of 25 patients; in 12 patients the reduction was greater than 90%. In the histamine release test, the polyclonally depleted extract was 200 to 300 times less potent than the crude cat-dander extract. These results indicate that a very large proportion of the allergenic activity of cat-dander extract is caused by a single molecule: Fel d I.\r"

Pooled fractions, analyzed by skin test or direct RAST, contained allergenic components over a molecular weight range of 10,500 to 20,000 daltons for all puffball spores studied except for S. areolatum (greater than 70,000 daltons). The Sephadex G-75 allergenic pool of C. cyathiformis was further fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Fractions were successively eluted with 4 and 1 mol/L buffered saline solutions and water. The 1 mol/L fraction contained maximal allergenic activity as determined by RAST-inhibition studies. At least 15 Coomassie blue staining bands were identified after isoelectrofocusing, of which 7 were shown by immunoprinting to bind IgE from a serum pool of five patients with allergy. Our results demonstrate that a combination of gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, RAST-inhibition, and immunoprinting studies can be used to fractionate, characterize, and standardize spore allergen extracts of puffballs for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose.\r"

However, less than one fourth of watermelon-sensitive individuals (i.e., those with detectable WM-IgE) develop such symptoms after watermelon ingestion. In an attempt to separate symptomatic from asymptomatic persons, we measured watermelon-specific-IgE and IgG4 concentrations in the sera of 29 watermelon-sensitive patients, 6 of whom were symptomatic. Although the mean WM-IgE level of the symptomatic group exceeded that of the asymptomatic group (p = 0.04), individual WM-IgE values failed to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic persons. No differences in WM-IgG4 levels between the two groups could be found. Watermelon extract proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were reacted with the individual sera of 14 watermelon-sensitive patients and then stained for IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 binding. Great variations in IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 binding patterns were found, but no subtype restrictions were discovered. Although the pattern of IgE-stained bands in the absence of corresponding IgG1-stained bands was seen more frequently in symptomatic individuals, immunoblot patterns failed to separate symptomatic from asymptomatic persons. We conclude that the pattern of IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 responses to separated watermelon allergens was not predictive of clinical symptoms in a group of watermelon-sensitive patients.\r"

Patients' serum IgE was bound to the surface of wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate previously coated with monoclonal murine antihuman IgE. After washing, AgE conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was added and was specifically bound by IgE. Optical density was recorded after addition of enzyme substrate to the wells and was proportional to the concentration of IgE directed against ragweed AgE in the serum samples. In contrast to many other assay techniques for antigen-specific IgE, interference by specific antibody of other classes cannot occur with this method. Results correlated well with those of a previously described solid-phase radioimmunoassay that required myeloma IgE.\r"

The four proteins were tested with a panel of sera from patients allergic to fire ant venom; all proteins had significant allergenic activity. These proteins corresponded to four of the bands we previously reported to be allergenic by immunoblot analysis. Sol i I has an apparent molecular weight of 37,000 daltons and yields bands of 18,000, 16,500 and 14,000 daltons in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; cation-exchange chromatography indicates that there are three charge forms. Sol i II has a native molecular weight of 28,000 daltons and appears to be easily cleaved into half molecules; it is a phospholipase structurally unlike either bee or wasp phopholipases. Sol i III has a native and denatured molecular weight of 26,000 daltons. Sol i IV has an apparent native molecular weight of 20,000 daltons and gives a single chain of 15,000 daltons in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sol i II and III are the major proteins in the venom; there are only small amounts of Sol i I and IV. All are significant allergens, and patients are found who react most strongly with each. Regression analysis of RAST data with highly purified allergens indicated that the IgE responses to the allergens were not related to each other. Amino acid compositions indicated that the four allergens were distinct and that the allergens were structurally different from each other. Four proteins identical to Sol i I to IV were isolated from hand-milked pure venom.\r"

Last, group 5 included patients allergic to bee and vespid venoms with fire ant exposure. None of the serum samples from group 1 was RAST reactive to fire ant venom, but 24% of those from group 2 were fire ant positive, as were 100% of those from group 3, 51% of those from group 4, and 87% of those from group 5. The RAST-positive patients in groups 2 and 5 were also skin test positive. RAST inhibition studies demonstrated cross-reactivity in some cases and multiple reactivity in others. The serum samples were further investigated via nondenaturing electrophoretic immunoblot studies and RAST with highly purified allergens. Serum samples from group 4 reacted to a single band on immunoblots and with only one of the four purified allergens from fire ant venom (Solenopsis invicta I, or Sol i I). Serum samples from groups 2, 3, and 5 showed various patterns of allergen reactivity. All serum samples from patients allergic to fire ant venom who also reacted to bee and/or vespid venoms by RAST contained IgE antibodies binding to Sol i I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When the nonionic detergent Tween 20 was removed from all incubations and washes, negative banding appeared, corresponding to bands that were clearly visible when Tween 20 had been used as a blocking agent. When Tween 20 was reintroduced, the bands reappeared. These results demonstrate that, although Tween 20 is effective in blocking unbound sites on nitrocellulose membranes, this and other nonionic detergents may cause nonspecific binding to immunoblots of oak-pollen proteins. Thus, care must be used in the interpretation of immunoblots to detect allergens when Tween 20 is used as the blocking agent.\r"

Recent studies have suggested that the inspired air conditions during recovery from exercise may also be important in determining the magnitude of postexercise airway narrowing. In the present study, normal subjects (n = 8) and patients with asthma (n = 12) were studied on separate days. On day 1 the subjects performed isocapnic hyperventilation with warm dry air and recovered breathing warm dry air. On the second day, an identical warm dry air challenge was administered, but recovery occurred while they were breathing warm humid air. There was no significant bronchoconstriction in the normal subjects, irrespective of the inspired air conditions during recovery. The patients with asthma showed greater bronchoconstriction during recovery in warm, humid air (maximal decrease in FEV1 31% +/- 17%) than in dry air (maximal decrease in FEV1 19% +/- 20%; p less than 0.05). These results suggest that the inspired air condition during recovery from isocapnic hyperventilation of dry air is also a determinant of the magnitude of the bronchoconstrictor response.\r"

Therapy is based on the frequency of episodes. Acute therapy is appropriate for infrequent episodes, but prophylactic therapy is indicated for frequent episodes. In patients with frequent episodes, remissions can be induced and maintained with prednisone. Prolonged remissions may occur after prednisone is stopped. There have been no deaths from IA in patients managed by our service. By definition, there is no identifiable antigen responsible for episodes of IA, and there is no underlying disease in these patients. A mast cell basophil-activation mechanism is suggested. IA may represent the most severe form of a spectrum of diseases that include idiopathic urticaria and angioedema.\r"

To understand the role of common environmental antigens in this disease, natural immunity to antigens derived from the house dust mite was evaluated in 22 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis and compared to a carefully matched group of patients with chronic asthma or to a group of normal individuals. Allergic reactivity to dust mites was very common in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, with 68% exhibiting a positive immediate skin test reaction and 41% exhibiting elevated levels of mite-specific serum IgE; 72% of patients with rhinosinusitis also exhibited markedly elevated levels of mite-specific serum IgG, which were present in both mite-allergic and nonallergic patients. IgG titers were much higher in the group with rhinosinusitis than in patients with asthma, whereas allergic reactivity to dust mites was significantly higher in the patients with asthma. Mite-specific immunity was low or absent in the group of normal individuals. These findings demonstrate that natural immunity to dust mites is very common in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and suggest that immunity to mites may be involved in this syndrome. Furthermore, the data indicate that there may be significant differences in the ability of patients with rhinosinusitis or asthma to produce mite-specific antibodies of the IgG class.\r"

  ".U": "89054682\r", 
  ".W": "We have evaluated a shortened protocol for measuring bronchial responsiveness to histamine. This safely eliminates unnecessarily low doses from a standard doubling dose sequence (i.e., full protocol) so that the dose provoking the definitive 20% decrement in FEV1 (PD20) is usually reached within two or three dose increments. In 20 subjects with asthma tested with both protocols, the ratio of geometric mean PD20 short protocol (86.8 micrograms) to PD20 full protocol (45.7 micrograms) was significantly greater than 1 when the results were expressed on a noncumulative scale (1.90 versus 1; p less than 0.001). When PD20 was expressed on a cumulative scale, the discordance was less striking (123.7 versus 89.2 micrograms, respectively), but this ratio (1.39) was still significantly greater than 1 (p = 0.007). By contrast, duplicated measurements of PD20 with the full protocol and the cumulative scale elicited a ratio of geometric mean PD20 day 1 (63.0 micrograms) to PD20 day 2 (67.0 micrograms) of 0.94, which was not significantly different from 1. Thus, the bronchoconstrictor effect of histamine depends on both the cumulative dose and the number of component doses. We conclude (1) that PD20 histamine is more nearly accurately expressed on a cumulative than on a noncumulative scale and (2) that histamine is less suitable for shortened protocols than methacholine because a reduction in the number of component doses produces significant distortion of the PD20 result.\r"

Nasal challenges with increasing numbers of orchard-grass pollen grains were performed in 60 patients allergic to grass pollens and 20 normal subjects. Before any challenge, the nose was washed three times with saline and then lactose, and 50, 150, 450, 1350, and 4050 orchard-grass pollen grains were insufflated into the nostrils until a symptom score of 5 was reached. This score was mainly based on major symptoms of allergic rhinitis, for example, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, sneezes, and to a lesser extent, on minor symptoms, such as pruritus, conjunctivitis, and pharyngitis. Nasal secretions were obtained after each challenge by lavage. Histamine was titrated by a radioimmunoassay with a monoclonal antibody against acylated histamine. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) was assayed with an enzyme immunoassay with a polyclonal antibody against PGD2 methoxamine. None of the normal subjects had a symptom score greater than 2; 55/60 patients had a positive challenge. The release of PGD2 was significantly (p less than 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) correlated with a symptom score of 5; 74.5% of patients had a significant release of PGD2 in nasal secretions. In contrast, although 58.2% of patients had a release of histamine in nasal secretions when the challenge was positive, the correlation with symptom scores was not significant. PGD2 in nasal secretions increased 3.7-fold after a positive nasal challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Phazet and SPTs have been compared in 130 subjects tested with six standardized allergen extracts: orchard-grass, olive, and mugwort pollens, cat dander, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Alternaria. Patients have been carefully selected on the basis of a suggestive clinical history, SPTs, and RAST. For all allergenic species, at least 20 nonsensitive individuals have been tested. The sensitivity (true positive in percent of patients with disease) of Phazet was 99.4%, and its specificity (true negative in percent of patients without disease) was 99.2%. It is concluded that Phazet and SPTs with standardized extracts are equally effective in the diagnosis of immediate-type allergy and that standardized extracts have improved the diagnosis of allergy, especially for previously poorly characterized extracts, such as Alternaria.\r"

Outcomes of the assessments were correlated with the dependent variables, net weight change, and current body mass index among 87 women not associated with a weight-loss program. The subjects were volunteers of middle socioeconomic status with a mean age of 45 years. Two-thirds were overfat. Multiple regression models were constructed to predict the dependent variables. The weight changers were most likely to be obese. Approximately 30% of the variance in body mass index could be accounted for by a positive association with eating anxiety scores and satisfaction with food intake scores. It was not possible to explain a meaningful portion of the variance in net weight change. The findings are consistent with a pendulum pattern of weight changes with a swing range of at least 1 year. Factors that are associated with obesity are not necessarily correlated with weight changes.\r"

  ".U": "89054698\r", 
  ".W": "The intake of cola beverages from two national surveys (NFCS 1977-78 and NHANES II) was used to examine certain assumptions important to a mathematical model employed to estimate dietary exposure to substances in food. The assumptions center on the relationship between frequency of consumption and serving size and on the constancy of serving size within age groups. Results showed the frequency of cola consumption was associated with 55% to 83% of the variability in cola intake and that mean cola serving size was not linearly related to frequency of consumption. However, while upper-level (90th + percentile) cola consumers consumed more frequently, they also had larger than average serving sizes. Therefore, because the model incorporates a standard serving size, it significantly underestimated (p less than .01) intake for the two groups of upper-level consumers examined. Furthermore, comparisons for cola serving sizes reported in the surveys showed differences by sex as well as systematic differences between the surveys in that the average difference between age and sex groups within each survey was similar, but NFCS 1977-78 had a larger average size for each group than did NHANES II. Attention should be given to the nature of the food consumption databases used for estimating dietary exposure because systematic bias may cause considerable differences in estimation.\r"

  ".W": "The development of a standardized screening mechanism for identifying patients in compromised nutritional status is beneficial for prompt initiation of nutrition care. A pilot screening study was conducted at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital over a 3-month period to determine the prevalence of patients meeting defined nutritional risk criteria. Dietetic technicians screened each nursing unit once, in random order, until the entire hospital had been screened. Results indicated that one-third of the 225 patients screened were at nutritional risk. From those results, a standardized screening protocol and charting form were developed. The current screening procedure includes the original pilot study parameters of height, weight, albumin, diagnosis, and type of nutritional support, as well as additional parameters. Dietetic technicians also collect data on weight changes, appetite status, number of surgical procedures, and length of hospital stay. Criteria are listed under a severe risk or a moderate risk category. Patients meeting one severe or two moderate risk criteria are considered at nutritional risk. Recent data verify that more than one-third of patients screened are at nutritional risk. Through the utilization of technical support personnel, the standardized protocol has helped to identify patients who meet nutritional risk criteria.\r"

Mean breast feeding duration equalled 20.5 weeks (range, 1 to 52 weeks). When an outside source of assistance (a doula) was available during the first 2 weeks postpartum, mean duration was 23.4 weeks compared with 12.3 weeks when a doula was unavailable (p less than .05). Breast feeding duration was independent of the doula's attitude regarding breast feeding. Duration of breast feeding was significantly longer for breast feeding women who participated in the USDA Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) than for those who did not participate. All of the women claimed to like breast feeding; 93% of the husbands or boyfriends, 83% of the women's mothers, and 81% of the women's best friends had positive attitudes toward breast feeding. The more breast feeding friends the woman had, the longer she breast fed (r = .32, p less than .05). Termination of breast feeding was not due to perceived negative attitudes of family members and peers regarding breast feeding.\r"

  ".W": "A nutrition assessment of 16 members of a community of lacto-ovo vegetarian Trappist monks was conducted in 1977. Plasma zinc was found to be low-normal, which was attributed primarily to high intakes of phytate-containing foods. Individual and group counseling were instituted over a 10-year period in an attempt to emphasize the importance of wise food selection within the constraints of lacto-ovo vegetarianism. In 1987, a more comprehensive nutrition assessment of 21 members of the same community was performed. Food composites were analyzed, and 3-day instead of 24-hour dietary records were kept. Intakes of phytate-containing foods had decreased from 4,569 to 972 mg/day; intake of dietary zinc had increased from 7.4 to 9.7 mg/day; and the phytate:zinc molar ratio had decreased from 67 to 14 for the years 1977 and 1987, respectively. An analyzed phytate:zinc molar ratio of 9.8 and an analyzed phytate x calcium:zinc molar ratio of 0.3 were representative of the 1987 community. Both were within normal ranges. Plasma zinc had risen to upper-normal levels. The 1987 nutrition assessment showed that it is possible to be adequately nourished with a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet provided one has proper knowledge of the phytate-containing foods and the methods for compensating with foods of greater mineral density (primarily zinc).\r"

  ".W": "In 1987, a second biennial mail survey of public health nutritionists in 54 state official public health agencies identified 2,048 budgeted positions compared with 2,931 in 1985, a 30% loss in the state and local health agencies. To achieve the recommended staffing ratio of one public health nutritionist per 50,000 population for policy, program planning, and program management, an estimated 2,812 more nutritionists are needed for a total of 4,850, or a 60% increase. The number of state personnel systems requiring graduate public health training decreased from 19 to 6, while the number requiring R.D./registration eligibility increased from 24 to 33. Fifty-five percent of positions for public health nutritionists are funded from the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and 10% from the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. Positions funded from state general revenue doubled from 8% in 1985 to 15% in 1987, while local revenue stayed at about 10%. The midpoint of state salary ranges for the public health nutritionists varied from $14,310 to $38,310. Perceived constraints to expanding nutrition services were inadequate state funding, low agency visibility, and low legislative priority. At a time when consumer interest in nutrition is high and research associates dietary factors with major public health problems, the challenge is to advocate more aggressively for public health nutrition services and funding.\r"

Frequent, specific feedback from the supervisor and linkage of formal rewards to performance are feedback strategies that could improve performance in foodservice.\r"

All nonelective medical admissions were prospectively assessed to determine the role of drug therapy as a contributory factor. Of the 863 eligible admissions, 162 exhibited at least one drug-related adverse patient event (DRAPE) at the time of hospitalization. This accounted for 19% of the admissions (23% of 718 admissions that involved prescription drugs). Although adverse drug reactions were responsible for many DRAPEs (48%), intentional noncompliance (27%), treatment failure (19%), alcohol (14%), and medication error (10%) were also frequent contributing causes. Drugs commonly implicated in DRAPEs were systemic steroids, digoxin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, alpha-methyldopa, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, theophylline, furosemide, sympathomimetics, thiazides, and benzodiazepines. The risk of a DRAPE was related to the number of diseases prior to admission (r = 0.81; P less than .026) and the number of drugs used (r = 0.77; P less than .001). Age was not correlated with the risk of a DRAPE. Females had significantly more adverse drug reactions, although sex was not a predictor for overall DRAPE risk.\r"

Using the multivariate technique of recursive partitioning, we identified four factors that distinguished 80% of all cases of delirium: 1) a urinary tract infection at any time during the hospital stay (odds ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 2.02-4.58); 2) no urinary tract infection, but low serum albumin on admission (odds ratio = 2.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.43-3.99); 3) neither urinary tract infection nor low serum albumin, but elevated white blood cell count on admission (odds ratio = 1.99; 95% confidence interval = 1.18-3.37); 4) none of these risk factors, but proteinuria on admission (odds ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.66). Patients without any of these four risk factors had the lowest probability of developing delirium during their hospital stay. Among individuals with delirium, in-hospital mortality and hospital charges were higher. The model developed accurately characterized the risk of delirium when it was tested on patients admitted to the same hospital during the subsequent year.\r"

  ".W": "This empirical study reports the proportion of hospitalized elderly patients who were identified as frail. As a part of a randomized controlled trial, standardized criteria were developed to target the frail hospitalized elderly for geriatric consultation. Twelve-hundred patients aged 65 years and older admitted to the medical and surgical services at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Medical Center were screened. Because of administrative exclusions of the randomized controlled trial (eg, short stay, lived too far away), 749 (62%) were excluded from the clinical screening process. The remaining 451 patients received clinical screening. Of these patients, almost two thirds (64%) were considered \"too independent\" to benefit from geriatric consultation (ie, independent in activities of daily living with short term illness), while 12% were judged \"too impaired\" to benefit (ie, had severe dementia or terminal cancer). Only 24% of those clinically screened (9% of the entire sample) were considered appropriate for geriatric consultation. Strikingly, over 42% of those patients aged 76 or older, were judged \"too independent.\" These data suggest that a large majority of the hospitalized elderly may be too well to benefit from geriatric consultation, thus making targeting by age alone inefficient. A realistic estimate of the percentage of hospitalized patients appropriate for geriatric intervention lies somewhere between 18% (the combined percentage of those found appropriate and those already enrolled in geriatric programs) and 24% (the proportion of the clinically evaluated group found appropriate). Targeting of subjects may be accomplished inexpensively using the authors' explicit criteria. Such targeting may help focus the use of interdisciplinary geriatric expertise on those most in need.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
