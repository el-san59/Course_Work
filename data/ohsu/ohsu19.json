  ".W": "To determine factors that may influence kidney stone formation in spinal cord injury patients, the medical records of 893 patients who had been followed up by the Milwaukee Veterans Administration Medical Center from 1970 to 1984 were extensively reviewed. Urography showed that 12 patients had kidney stones. Twenty-four non-kidney stone patients with a similar age range, sex and duration of time since injury were selected as controls. Variables, such as level of spinal lesion, completeness of neurological dysfunction, presence of ureteric reflux etc, were compared and analysed statistically. The results showed that there was no difference between patients with and those without renal stone as far as the level of spinal injury and completeness of spinal cord lesion were concerned. There was no relationship between kidney stone formation and methods of urinary drainage or the presence of ureteric reflux. However, patients with good bladder control had no renal calculi. Serum creatinine, phosphorus, uric acid and calcium levels were similar in both groups of patients. There was a relationship between sepsis, positive urine culture and kidney stone formation. The absence of physical activity was not a risk factor for renal calculi and patients on a high fibre diet had the same incidence of stones as those on a regular diet.\r"

Urinary magnesium, uric acid, serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium and uric acid were not affected. There were no changes in serum iron, copper and zinc even when patients were treated for long periods. The treatment was tolerated well and there were no serious side effects. Rice-bran therapy is particularly useful in patients with hyperabsorptive hypercalciuria and it is effective in the prevention of recurrent urinary stone disease.\r"

Seventy-five per cent of refluxing ureters showed absence of reflux after one injection of Polytef paste; 14% of ureters required two to four sub-ureteric injections of Polytef paste for the correction of vesicoureteric reflux; 8% of ureters showed improvement in the grade of reflux after the initial injection of Polytef paste. Duplex systems were more difficult to correct and recurrence of reflux was much higher than in primary reflux. Follow-up intravenous urograms showed no evidence of ureteric obstruction in the treated ureters. The procedure is safe, simple and effective in correcting all grades of vesicoureteric reflux. To obtain best results, attention should be paid to minute details of the technique and the injection made with pinpoint accuracy.\r"

Infection was excluded by culture and microscopy of the specimens of urine. No patient was hypertensive. Albumin excretion increased in patients with increasing severity of VUR and with renal scarring. Similar findings were observed with RBP excretion. The results show that glomerular and tubular handling of proteins is altered in VUR. The degree of microproteinuria correlates well with the severity of the VUR and is evidence of tubular dysfunction. The effects of medical management and anti-reflux surgery on microproteinuria require further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five men with chronic retention of urine were studied in order to investigate the relationship between upper tract dilatation and bladder pressure. Each underwent assessment of upper tract dilatation and urodynamic investigation before bladder drainage. Patients were reassessed 3 or more months after operation. Residual urine and detrusor contraction pressure decreased significantly after operation (P less than 0.0001:P less than 0.01). A significant increase in effective cystometric capacity and a significant decrease in pressure rise during filling led to an improvement in compliance. At pre-operative assessment, patients with upper tract dilatation had a significantly greater resting bladder pressure (P less than 0.05), end filling pressure (P less than 0.002) and pressure rise during filling (P less than 0.02) than those without upper tract dilatation. In addition, statistically significant correlations were found between serum creatinine and end filling pressure (P less than 0.05) and between upper tract dilatation and both high end filling pressure (greater than 25 cm H2O) and high pressure rise during filling (greater than 15 cm H2O: both P less than 0.05). Whilst high end filling pressure and high pressure rise during filling were found to be closely associated with upper tract dilatation (sensitivity 93 and 100%), there was a high false positive rate (specificity 64 and 45%). Furthermore, statistical analysis demonstrated that these data had a continuous though skewed distribution, suggesting that it is not possible to make a clear distinction between high and low pressure chronic retention.\r"

Only 18% of the indwelling catheters remained in situ for the designated period of 1 month. The other catheters were changed before that time, mainly because of obstructed drainage or leakage of urine around the catheter. The incidence of bacteriuria among catheterised patients was 90%. The bacteria were multiresistant in 37% of these cases, compared with 25% of non-catheterised patients. Multiresistant microflora were present significantly more often in the urine of patients admitted from hospitals (irrespective of whether they had a catheter) and the catheterised residents of the centre than in that of the other patients (P less than 0.001). When all patients of the centre were considered, it was found that 30.6% were treated with antimicrobial agents in the course of the year; 10.9% were treated more than once a year. This latter group of patients received 58% of all prescribed antimicrobial drugs; 37% of them had an indwelling catheter. The majority of catheterised patients (65%) did not need antimicrobial treatment. No significant influence of catheterisation on mortality could be demonstrated.\r"

Half of the patients had severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml) and three-quarters had developed antisperm antibodies, often in high titres. Spermatogenesis was shown by testicular biopsy to be normal (Johnsen score-count greater than 8.0) in almost all of the obstructed testes, and serum FSH levels were normal. Following surgical reconstruction, with prednisolone therapy if indicated by high antisperm antibody titres, 19 (32%) of 60 patients with adequate follow-up successfully impregnated their female partners, with the best results occurring in 30 men who started with sperm counts less than 5 million/ml, 12 of whom (40%) were successful. Removal of irreparably blocked testes in 10 men led to profound falls in high antisperm antibody titres, with production of two pregnancies.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for human leucocytes were used in an immunoperoxidase technique. In addition to the standard sperm analysis, each specimen was also tested for sperm antibodies, aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis. Leucocytes were found in large numbers in the fertile men compared with the patients. Lymphocytes were found in 20% of the patients. Micro-organisms were cultured from a similar proportion of both groups. We found no correlation between leucocyte counts, sperm density and motility, sperm antibodies and growth of micro-organisms. Our results cast doubt on the conventional criteria of subclinical genital tract infection, namely positive culture and excess leucocyte counts.\r"

  ".U": "87101973\r", 
  ".W": "In visually-guided slow ramp elbow tracking, patients with cerebellar ataxia show irregular undulations of pursuit velocity which result in a position tracking pattern unlike the smooth constant velocity or rate tracking pattern of normal controls (Beppu et al., 1984). This task provides ample opportunity to use both visual and proprioceptive feedback information for correcting errors. The present study investigated the role of visual information for generation of this saccadic pursuit pattern in the patients. A television screen was divided into upper and lower halves in each of which a vertical strip was displayed. The upper strip (T, target) was moved horizontally from the centre of the screen to the left or right by ramp voltage. The lower strip (D, displacement of the handle) was moved in proportion to angular displacement of the handle by a potentiometer coupled to the handle axis. The subject, while sitting in front of the screen, had to make D match the movement of T by controlling the handle with his arm. The range of T movement was 30 deg in terms of the angular movement of the handle. T velocity was 6.0 or 7.5 deg/s. After a training session, the test was performed in which D or T was suddenly erased from the screen during pursuit, depriving the subject of visual information about the moving limb and/or performance. The procedure gave only minor effects on the performance of the control subjects, but it reduced significantly the velocity undulation of the patients with cerebellar ataxia, producing a smoother continuous pursuit. There were no significant differences in performance between D or T erase tasks. The result supports the hypothesis that the marked undulation pattern during pursuit movement in cerebellar ataxia is due to repeated visually-guided error correction responses. The relative importance of the visual pathway for conveying position information and the proprioceptive pathway for movement velocity information in this visual slow ramp tracking task is also discussed.\r"

These consisted of 10 patients with a selective delay of the pattern VEP due to demyelination of one optic nerve (unilateral optic neuritis) and 11 patients with a selective delay of the flash VEP due to pathology of the visual association areas (primary presenile dementia, or Alzheimer's disease). The results led to the following conclusions. Comparison of the VEP and CSF results indicated that VEP latency was more closely associated with the temporal CSF than the spatial CSF. Pathology of the visual association areas which selectively increased the latency of the flash P2 component also reduced sensitivity at low and medium temporal frequencies. In demyelination of the optic nerve, a highly significant correlation was found between the delay of the pattern reversal VEP and sensitivity at high temporal frequencies. Comparison of the results in these two types of pathology suggests that the pattern VEP and flash P1 component, the spatial CSF, and temporal CSF at high temporal frequencies are all processed in the geniculostriate pathway. The flash P2 component and temporal CSF at low and medium frequencies were affected differently from the other measures. The possibility that these processes are transmitted by nongeniculate pathways is discussed.\r"

All showed a consistent and largely symmetric pattern of neurological deficit similar to that displayed by 5 Europeans with longstanding lathyrism now living in Israel. Hallmarks of lathyrism include a pyramidal pattern of motor weakness combined with greatly increased tone in the thigh extensors and adductors and in the gastrocnemius muscles so that the more severely affected walk on the balls of their feet with a lurching scissoring gait. Extensor plantar responses are uniformly present in such cases, and the knee and ankle tendon reflexes are exaggerated and often clonic. Hoffmann signs and exaggerated biceps and/or triceps tendon jerks are also found in the most severely affected. Sensory signs are absent, although perverse sensations in the legs are frequently reported at the onset. Walking difficulties commonly begin suddenly but may also appear subacutely or insidiously. Some individuals experience partly reversible symptoms suggestive of a diffuse CNS excitation of somatic, motor and autonomic function.\r"

In Experiments 1 and 2 the first hypothesis was tested by measuring reaction times (RTs) to visual stimuli presented in the LVF and in the RVF, whereas the second hypothesis was tested by measuring RTs to stimuli totally positioned in the LVF, and in the RVF. The results showed that RTs to stimuli which occupied a relative left position were longer than RTs to stimuli which occupied a relative right position independent of the visual field stimulated and RTs to LVF stimuli were longer than RTs to RVF stimuli. Experiment 3 was designed to examine whether the attentional deficit associated with right parietal damage was mostly related to the use of gravitational rather than to retinal coordinates. In this experiment the patients tilted the head either to the left or the right by 90 deg and they responded to two stimuli displayed above and on either side of a fixation mark. The results showed that the difficulty in attending to the left was related both to the gravitational and the retinal frames of reference.\r"

Eight of the 9 patients treated with corticosteroids showed improvement, with pain usually receding within 48 hours. The cerebrospinal fluid was abnormal in 7 of 12 cases, with either a mild pleocytosis or raised protein content. The cranial nerves most frequently involved were the third and sixth. Motor nerves were affected more than sensory. Corticosteroid therapy appeared to hasten recovery of function. Clinical features are shared by both syndromes, the resulting spectrum of illness probably reflecting diverse aetiologies. Historical perspectives, differential diagnosis and aetiological considerations are discussed so that a coherent prospective clinical approach to the problem can be developed.\r"

We describe a total of 19 cases of neurobrucellosis in whom the clinical presentation lay in three distinct categories. The first was an acute presentation with meningoencephalitis. The disease also presented in a chronic form where the brunt of the illness can either be in the peripheral or the central nervous system (CNS). The chronic peripheral form is that of a proximal polyradiculoneuropathy. The central form is that of diffuse CNS involvement, predominantly with myelitis or cerebellar involvement with or without cranial nerve palsies. Although the two chronic forms, 'peripheral' and 'central', are distinct, some overlap is possible. This was not observed for the acute form. The pathology of the three presentations may be different, being a direct effect of infection in the acute form, and an immune-related process, possibly demyelinating in nature, in the chronic forms. The response to treatment in the acute and chronic forms is also different, being much better in the acute form. Awareness of the condition and performance of the appropriate serological tests will differentiate neurobrucellosis from other chronic CNS infections, especially tuberculosis and neurosyphilis.\r"

This phenomenon was observed in 17 out of 35 patients with right putaminal haemorrhage and only 1 out of 30 patients with right thalamic haemorrhage, suggesting it may be useful in differentiating putaminal from thalamic haemorrhage in the right hemisphere. Three patients, with cervical tumour, cervical disc herniation and multiple sclerosis also showed alloaethesia. They had anterolateral lesions of the spinal cord. The cerebral and spinal cord lesions presented similar symptomatic characteristics of alloaesthesia. It is suggested that as alloaesthesia is produced by noxious stimuli not only in spinal cord but also in cerebral lesions it may represent an elementary sensory disturbance of sensory pathways, and not a higher cortical dysfunction.\r"

As a previous investigation had established that neuropsychological tests thought to be sensitive to the functional integrity of the frontal lobes are selectively impaired in Parkinson's disease, the first phase of this study compared the five groups on five such tests and two tests of psychomotor ability. While all patient groups displayed deficits on the psychomotor tests and on several tests associated with frontal lobe function compared with normals, only the Poor Response group was impaired on all tasks. In a second phase, comprehensive testing of additional cognitive processes such as attention, mnemonic, and visuospatial functions, the latter two traditionally thought to depend primarily on posterior cortical regions, revealed no significant cognitive deficits in any patient group. Results are discussed with respect to the involvement of the nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopaminergic systems.\r"

Among other capacities, he was able to discriminate between lines of different orientation in the frontal plane. Given the reported deficits for form discrimination but a high sensitivity for orientation discrimination in primates without striate cortex, the question arises whether D.B.'s apparent 'form' discrimination arises from an ability to discriminate the orientations of components of the figures. It is shown in the first experiment, by using the optic disc as a control, that his ability to detect stimuli in his scotoma cannot be due to stray light falling upon the intact field. Next, his ability to discriminate orientations is confirmed, and an orientation threshold determined. A range of form discriminations is presented varying in degree of orientation cues of their components. It is confirmed that he can discriminate those forms originally studied, in which such differences are large, but not when orientation cues are small or minimal. Finally, his ability to compare two forms both projected within his scotoma is examined. Even when the components of the two forms have large orientation differences and are highly discriminable when presented successfully, D.B. appears to be unable to make a 'same-different' comparison when both are presented simultaneously. The evidence is interpreted against D.B.'s having a residual capacity for form discrimination.\r"

  ".W": "Haemorrhagic infarction is typically not present immediately after cerebral embolism. Spontaneous haemorrhagic transformation evolves over several days. As a consequence, delayed CT scans are essential to exclude haemorrhagic infarction before initiating anticoagulant therapy. Sequential CT scanning can also help in the diagnosis of cerebral embolism in patients with stroke of unknown cause. In such cases the detection of haemorrhagic infarction on a delayed scan suggest an embolic mechanism. The evolution of haemorrhagic infarction on sequential CT scans graphically demonstrates the dynamic nature of this lesion and thereby indicates why serious brain haemorrhage may result from anticoagulation immediately after cerebral embolism.\r"

Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions. The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range. Part I of this two-part article, which examined the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage, appeared in the October issue of the Journal; in this, the second and final part of his article, the author focuses on eye protection.\r"

Patients were followed up from 4 to 13 months (average: 8.5 months). Irreversible silicone keratopathy was found in 50% of the eyes in the AIC group between 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. An intact lens or capsule correlated well with the absence of this complication. In phakic eyes, secondary cataract was the most prominent early complication, developing by the end of the eighth week in 60% of eyes. Other early complications were inflammatory surface silicone membranes, rubeosis, iritis, glaucoma and capsular opacification.\r"

Seven of these had peripheral disease with rapid recurrences. Two had untreated disc tumours. Tumours less than 1 disc diameter (DD) in size were easily treated with photocoagulation. Multiple treatments of cryotherapy were required for larger tumours. Scleral buckle and early vitrectomy are recommended for vitreous traction. Tumour in a 4-year-old and a de-novo tumour in a 42-year-old lead us to recommend life-time surveillance of patients at risk. Many patients had false negative family histories. A review of the literature leads us to suspect that the majority of retinal angiomas are familial. We emphasize the ophthalmologist's responsibility to investigate such patients.\r"

The agents responsible for sexually transmitted diseases in abused children are reviewed. Many crucial psychosocial issues are raised in the evaluation and management of sexual abuse. The author discusses some aspects of abuse that are hard to confront, such as the possible pleasure of the child and the nonoffending role of the mother in cases of incest. Information from sources other than the medical literature on the characteristics of abusers, therapy and prevention is reviewed. The medical implications of the Badgley Report are also discussed.\r"

The values obtained were related to tumor characteristics such as Dukes' stage, differentiation, DNA ploidy pattern, expression of secretory component (SC), volume, and plasma level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Statistical comparison was made with matched controls. Only patients with Stage D tumors showed significantly increased serum levels of SIgA and SIgM (P less than 0.004). The combined diagnostic sensitivity of SIg and CEA in Stage D was 0.94. In patients with liver involvement, serum SIgA and SIgM were elevated in 67% and 53%, respectively. However, circulating SIg was neither correlated with tumor SC expression nor with any other studied variable. Thus, the raised serum SIg levels were apparently not caused by release of SC from the tumors but, instead, by hampered liver function due to hepatic metastasis.\r"

Age and sex distribution, clinical and laboratory findings and evolution were not different from previously reported series. Median duration of survival was 24 months. Parameters associated with a longer survival in our series were localized adenopathies (P = 0.01) and the achievement of a remission (P less than 0.0001). Features associated with a shorter survival included drug exposure in relation to the onset of the disease (P = 0.02), rash (P less than 0.0001), lymph node eosinophilia (P = 0.03) and elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (P = 0.03). Drug exposure and rash were, however, significantly dependent (P = 0.02). In addition, lymphopenia, the presence of circulating immune complexes, and the absence of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia may indicate a poor prognosis, although the significance level is not achieved in this short series. None of the parameters tested was significantly related to the lymphomatous transformation of AIL, which occurred in four cases. It is concluded that multicentric prospective studies of AIL are necessary in order to better define this disorder, to find prognostic factors, and to optimize therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In patients who have locally advanced and inoperable head and neck cancer, the achievement of initial local control (complete response) of the disease with initial definitive treatment with radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy, is an important prognostic factor for overall survival. Cisplatin 100 mg/M2-intravenously (IV) with hydration and mannitol diuresis was given every 3 weeks for three doses concurrently with definitive radiotherapy (followed by salvage surgery [if possible] for persistent disease) was activated by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) in 1981. One hundred thirty-four patients were initially registered and 124 were eligible and analyzed for this report. Eighty-two percent of the patients had Stage IV disease and greater than 50% of the primary sites were in oropharynx (39%), nasopharynx (22%), and oral cavity (18%). Eighty-seven percent of the patients are known to have finished the planned RT greater than 6450 cGy and 60% received three courses of cisplatin. Overall, 60% finished the planned combined treatment. Complete response to initial treatment occurred in 69% and an additional one patient (1%) was rendered disease-free after radical node dissection. Severe toxicities were as follows: leukopenia, 11%; anemia, 8%; nausea and vomiting, 6%; stomatitis, 31%; and renal, 6%. One toxic death occurred when a nephrotoxic antibiotic was administered at the same time. All patients were evaluated for total disease and survival regardless of compliance to the treatment or the cause of death. At 1 year, an estimated 51% of the patients had their disease totally controlled and an estimated 66% were alive. Incidence of initial complete response by various patient characteristics also were analyzed. The authors concluded that the combination of cisplatin and radiotherapy is an effective and safe treatment in patients with advanced head and neck cancer and needs to be tested against radiotherapy alone.\r"

Weanling rats were injected intracerebrally with avian sarcoma virus, which induced malignant gliomas in situ before injection of Rh123. Comparison was made of the amount of fluorescence of Rh123 within the normal cerebral cortex, myelinated tracts of the brain, meninges, choroid plexus, and neoplastic foci at 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after intravenous injection. Fluorescence microscopy was utilized to identify tissues containing the dye. Normal neuropil did not contain Rh123 at any of the time periods studied. Gliomas retained the dye at 1, 4, 8 and 12 hours, with increasing uniformity of distribution and decreasing intensity of fluorescence over this time period. Fluorescence was not detected at 24 hours within the neoplastic tissues, but was evident at all time periods studied within the choroid plexus. The specific retention of Rh123 by malignant glioma and by the choroid plexus in vivo suggests that Rh123 may be useful for photochemotherapeutic treatment of brain neoplasms and disorders of the choroid plexus.\r"

Growth of most cultures was stimulated by the estrogens 17 beta-estradiol and ethinyl estradiol, and any combination containing ethinyl estradiol. Most (75%) malignant specimens were stimulated by one or more of the progestins, whereas none of the nonmalignant cells were. For two of the estrogen/progestin combinations found in many birth control pills, malignant cells were stimulated to grow faster than nonmalignant cells. It was concluded that oral contraceptive steroids can stimulate the growth of mammary epithelia in cell culture and might do the same in vivo. These data corroborate epidemiologic data which suggest oral contraceptives might act as tumor promoters, especially in the older user, who is more likely to have malignant cells already present in the breast.\r"

Interestingly, anergic patients unresponsive to four antigens showed significantly more depressed serum zinc levels as well as decreased lymphoproliferative response to mitogen (PHA). A positive correlation could be shown between serum zinc level, cutaneous anergy and LP.

In a Cox regression analysis, tumor ploidy and presence or absence of ascites were the only significant factors for survival, whereas ascites and residual tumor proved to be the significant parameters for progression-free survival. Tumor ploidy was strongly associated with tumor bulk, size of residual tumor, and histologic grade. Tumor ploidy was the same within different tumor sites in the majority of the cases. On the basis of these findings tumor ploidy is considered to be a major prognostic factor for survival in advanced ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "From 1960 to 1985 at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, seven cases of malignant lymphoma of bone (MLB) were identified in children younger than 16 years of age. Over the same period there were 88 cases of Ewing's sarcoma (ES), which illustrates the rarity of MLB. All cases were staged and treated according to protocols current at the time, namely, systemic chemotherapy with radiotherapy to the primary lesions. One child received radiotherapy alone as chemotherapy was not then available (1963). The disease-free five-year survival rate in our small series is 57%, which compares favorably with the 62% that we have calculated from survival data available from 26 previously reported cases of MLB in children and better than the 35% to 50% quoted in adult series of MLB. The main problem in differential diagnosis is distinguishing MLB from ES. A positive diagnosis of MLB rather than ES can be made, however, by observation of the characteristic reticulin staining pattern, the absence of cytoplasmic glycogen, and the ultrastructure.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1, 1980, and July 31, 1985, 168 patients were treated at our institution for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Splenectomy was performed on 32 (23 men and 9 women). The mean age of these surgical patients was 59.4 years (range, 43-75). Twenty-four patients had received chemotherapy and/or corticotherapy prior to surgery and 1 of these 24 also underwent splenic radiotherapy. The interval between diagnosis and splenectomy ranged from 1 to 108 months (mean, 33.6 months +/- 28.6). Before splenectomy, 9 patients had platelet counts greater than 100,000/mm3 (3 with normal counts), 18 had counts between 50,000 and 100,000/mm3, and 5 had less than 50,000/mm3. Seven patients had anemia with hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dl (3 associated with thrombocytopenia); in the other 25 patients, hemoglobin levels were between 10 and 11 g/dl in 12 (9 associated with thrombocytopenia) and greater than 11 g/dl in 13. All patients but one had splenomegaly (mean spleen weight 1780 g +/- 938.7 range, 160-4300 g). One postoperative death was recorded. Postoperative morbidity occurred in 7 of 31 cases; severe infection was never observed. The average duration of hospitalization was 15 +/- 4.7 days (range, 9-28). Twenty-two of the 23 patients with thrombocytopenia less than 100,000/mm3 had complete remission after splenectomy. One had a partial remission that was later completed by means of drug therapy. Two patients relapsed within 6 months and one after 32 months. All but two cases of anemia responded to splenectomy; one patient relapsed. In 15 of 31 surviving patients, further treatment was required within a few weeks or months after surgery. Five patients died at 8, 17, 22, 26, and 35 months, respectively. The other 26 patients are alive and well with a mean follow-up of 34 months (range, 11-71 months). Splenectomy may be an effective treatment for CLL patients with splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and/or anemia.\r"

Sixteen involved the breast alone (Stage IE), whereas two also involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes (Stage IIE). None had B symptoms. Histologic subtypes included 11 diffuse histiocytic, 4 diffuse poorly differentiated, 2 diffuse mixed and one nodular mixed. Thirteen patients (72%) are alive with 55 months median follow-up (11 months-14 years). Three patients died with recurrent disease at less than 2 years, one recurred at 4 years and died 6 years after diagnosis, and one died at 30 months without clinical evidence of disease. Seven (39%) have remained continuously disease-free (11 months-11 years; median, 54 months). Of the clinical Stage I patients, 1 of 3 treated with mastectomy alone recurred in the scar, whereas 1 of 12 treated with irradiation alone recurred locally. Thus, radiation therapy alone achieved good local control, although distant relapses remain a problem in these clinically staged patients. Overall, the outcome of clinically localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast is similar to that for localized lymphoma in other sites.\r"

Two hundred eighty-two patients with potential curative resected lung carcinoma were analyzed in the prospective study. Data showed similarities in distribution of cell type and relative frequency of pT1 stage in both collectives. Major differences between both studies were obtained in relative frequencies of pT3, and pN0, pN1, and pN2 stages. Survival of patients grouped according to cell type revealed differences between patients suffering from epidermoid-adeno carcinoma and patients suffering from small anaplastic carcinoma--large cell anaplastic carcinoma in both studies. Patients stated as pN0 stages showed more favourable prognosis in the prospective study compared with patients of the retrospective study. Two-year survival rates of patients grouped into a pT1pN0 stage and into a pT2pN0 stage had similar survival rates in both studies. Survival of these cohorts compared with patients staged as pT1pN1 and pT2pN1 was statistically significantly better. The data indicate that patients suffering from pT1pN1 or pT2pN1 tumors should be classified as Stage II tumors.\r"

The mean overall survival time for all patients was 98.2 months, and the disease-free 2-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 68%, 51%, and 34%, respectively.

Comparing observed incidence rates to expected on the basis of SEER incidence data, two malignant tumors, urinary bladder cancer and malignant lymphoma, appeared to occur in excess in the present series of patients. The excess of urinary bladder cancer in our series could be explained by detection bias due to the routine use of cystoscopy. The excess incidence of lymphoma in our series appears significant but its etiology is unexplained.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, recombinant DNA methods have been successfully applied to interferon production, making adequate quantities available for both in vitro and in vivo testing. Although interferons are in the class of biologic response modifiers, they do have some direct cytotoxic effects on human tumor cells that can be quantitated in vitro with the colony-forming assay. In the clonogenic assay, RPMI-8226 myeloma cells were tested with interferon alfa-2b (Intron A, Schering Corp., Kenilworth, NJ), melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. With concentrations of interferon alfa-2b as low as 1 U/ml (international antiviral activity), colony number was reduced to less than 30% of the untreated control cultures. Both melphalan and cyclophosphamide showed measurable cytotoxic activity, with the ID50 of melphalan at 0.15 microgram/ml and that of cyclophosphamide at 0.4 microgram/ml. Prednisone had the least cytotoxic effect when tested with these myeloma cells as a single agent. Additive antiproliferative effects were noted with combinations of interferon alfa-2b plus cyclophosphamide and interferon alfa-2b plus prednisone. However, the interferon-melphalan combination showed synergistic effects on tumor colony cell reduction. Even greater cytotoxic activity was seen with the three-drug combination of interferon alfa-2b, melphalan, and prednisone. Clinical trials have shown that interferon alfa-2b may be effective in relapsing and refractory patients with multiple myeloma. Of 38 evaluable patients, a total of seven responded to treatment; one patient had a complete response, and six had a partial response. Three of the seven responders have continued to respond for over 33 months, with monoclonal proteins approaching undetectable levels. A pilot study of the feasibility of combining interferon alfa-2b with melphalan and prednisone in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma has been completed. It is concluded that interferon alfa-2b, in dosages not exceeding 2.0 X 10(6) IU/m2, can be safely given in combination with melphalan and prednisone, without compromising melphalan dosage. Although response was not the primary objective of the study, an overall response of 75% was achieved using the criteria established by the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force.\r"

The degree of anticellular effect is related to the concentration of interferon achieved and to the duration of tumor cell exposure. In a clinical setting, the highest levels of interferon that can be achieved are seen when interferon is given by the intraperitoneal route. One Phase I clinical trial of intraperitoneally administered alpha interferon has shown complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) in 5 (45%) of 11 patients, each response determined by surgical re-exploration. The most favorable patient group for the tumor responses was the one having residual tumor bulk less than 5 mm in size. Combinations of interferon and standard cytotoxic drugs have been studied both in preclinical and clinical trials. One of the most active combinations is that of alpha interferon plus doxorubicin, which often shows an additive and occasionally synergistic combined effect. In a Phase II clinical trial of combined parenterally administered alpha interferon and doxorubicin, clinically determined CR and PR were seen in 7 (29%) of 24 patients with relapsing ovarian cancers. In this preliminary clinical trial, toxicity of the combination regimen was acceptable.\r"

  ".W": "Gross excision of the tumor followed by radiotherapy is used for treatment of early breast cancer. Local recurrence after this form of treatment is uncommon except in patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma whose excision specimens reveal an extensive intraductal component (EIC). It is unclear whether this observation is due to a qualitative difference in the response of tumors with EIC to radiation or to a quantitative difference in the tumor burden remaining after gross excision in patients with EIC. To address this question, the authors examined pathologic material in 71 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma treated with gross excision of the tumor and then selected for re-excision of the tumor site prior to radiotherapy because of the presence of either EIC in the primary excision specimen or microscopic tumor at or close to margins in the initial excision. Residual carcinoma was seen in 62% of all patients but was more frequent among the 25 patients with EIC than the 46 without (88% vs. 48%, P = 0.002). The nature of the residual tumor differed for patients with and without EIC in the primary excision specimen. Residual carcinoma in patients with EIC was often widespread and composed predominantly of intraductal carcinoma. In contrast, residual tumor in patients without EIC usually consisted of only scattered microscopic foci of infiltrating and/or intraductal carcinoma. The authors conclude that patients with EIC treated with gross excision of the tumor frequently have considerable residual intraductal carcinoma near the primary site. This finding may account for the increased risk of local recurrence observed in patients with EIC treated without re-excision of the tumor site before radiation therapy.\r"

The total response rate was 34% and the 5-year survival rate was 24.5%. Responders had significantly higher performance status and hemoglobin values at the start of chemotherapy. During chemotherapy the mean nadir values of leukocytes and thrombocytes were identical for responders and nonresponders and the degree of myelosuppression measured in this way did not predict the probability of tumor response or survival. The bone marrow of nonresponders seemed to be more active, judging from a tendency towards higher leukocyte and thrombocyte cell counts before the individual chemotherapy courses than in responders. Dose reduction and interval prolongation seemed to worsen the prognosis with regard to tumor response and long-term survival. Combination chemotherapy with melphalan-doxorubicin was superior to single drug therapy with melphalan with regard to bone marrow toxicity, tumor response rate and survival. The most important single prognostic factor at the start of chemotherapy was the performance status (Karnofsky's index). Myelosuppression per se did not improve the prognosis with regard to tumor response or survival in this series.\r"

A study of regional chemotherapy was conducted in rabbits bearing the VX-2 carcinoma. Modes of therapy examined were intravenous (IV), intra-arterial (IA), IA with stopflow, IA with outflow occlusion, and isolation-perfusion (I-P). Each mode was evaluated by examining the pharmacokinetics of DDP in systemic and regional administration and measuring tissue concentrations of DDP. It was observed that the systemic exposure to DDP was significantly less for IA with outflow occlusion and I-P when compared to IV, IA, or IA with stopflow occlusion (P = 0.003). Tumor concentrations were highest with IA infusion with outflow occlusion (P = 0.002) and IA stopflow occlusion (P = 0.03). Tumor tissue concentrations were always higher than adjacent muscle DDP concentrations. The authors conclude that significant pharmacologic advantage can be demonstrated for certain modes of DDP administration in this rabbit model, and that these promising results should be followed by clinical trials.\r"

The TFA bore a significant correlation to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in these cases. Mean TFA value with standard deviation (SD) was 8.3 +/- 6.3 U in 48 cases with DIC, which was significantly higher than 0.3 +/- 4.2 U in 34 cases without DIC. Whereas Mean TFA in non-M3 was 0.9 +/- 6.3 U which was significantly lower than 37.2 +/- 2.3 U in M3, some non-M3 showed TFA as high as M3 and were complicated by DIC. In heparin treatment, dosage of heparin could not be controlled by either APTT or AcCT but was controlled by the extent of TFA of leukemia cells. Retrospective analysis of clinical features revealed that 97000X + 9000 units/day (X = logarithm value of TFA) of heparin is an adequate dosage for the successful treatment of DIC when TFA of leukemia cells is 0.8 U or more.\r"

The authors examined local bone changes in primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone in a 59-year-old woman. Three noninvolved and three tumor-involved sites were evaluated by quantitative determinations of bone structural and dynamic features. Compared to noninvolved sites, tumor-involved bone was characterized by significantly increased osteoblast index (89.4 +/- 15.6 [mean +/- SEM] versus 7.3 +/- 6.0, P = 0.008), percent osteoid area (12.1 +/- 2.7 versus 1.2 +/- 0.5, P = 0.02), percent of trabecular surface covered by osteoid (70.0 +/- 6.0 versus 14.5 +/- 4.8, P = 0.002), and percent osteoid lined by osteoblasts (36.4 +/- 3.6 versus 3.7 +/- 3.0, P = 0.002). Bone 7.8 mm distant from invading tumor cells showed features characteristic of noninvolved sites, whereas bone completely surrounded by tumor showed markedly decreased osteoblast features. Osteoblast function also was affected by tumor; the amount of matrix laid down per day bore a significant positive correlation with the osteoblast index. These data indicate the following: distinctive bone morphologic changes occur in situ during invasion by MFH; changes affect aspects of bone formation but not resorption during invasion; both osteoblast number and osteoblast activity are significantly altered; and changes are local in nature and probably reflect the osteoblast response to local tumor factor(s) and are dependent upon the extent of tumor invasion.\r"

In both cases aneuploidy and multiple chromosome aberrations of hemopoietic cells were evident. In one patient these changes included a clonal 14q + abnormality in association with other complex rearrangements, interpreted as translocation abnormalities involving t(6;14), 5(1;15), and t(17;19). Although the chromosome abnormalities in the other patient were nonclonal, a 14q abnormality also was detected, namely t(14q+;18q-). Other chromosome abnormalities (all nonclonal) in the two patients included translocations involving chromosome 5 and deletion of 7q in one patient and trisomy of chromosome 8 in the other. Although these abnormalities have been associated with the presence or development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute nonlymphoblastic anemia, or myelodysplastic disorders, the findings in these patients suggest that the detection of clones and potential clones with these abnormalities may be only one stage in the development of secondary malignancy.\r"

Petrosal and jugular vein sampling did not yield a gradient of ACTH. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue removed at pancreatectomy was positive for ACTH and beta endorphin, and negative for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Tumor cells cultured in vitro secreted ACTH and beta-endorphin, which comigrated with their respective radiolabeled standards on gel chromatography. Hydrocortisone suppressed in vitro ACTH secretion and CRF (100 nM) stimulated ACTH by 50% during 72 hours of incubation. Agarose gel electrophoresis of poly-(A) mRNA extracts of tumor tissue followed by hybridization with 32P-cDNA for POMC revealed 2 distinct RNA species. The major RNA species (about 1.0 kb) was smaller than authentic pituitary POMC mRNA (about 1.1 kb); a larger precursor band also was visualized, suggesting either processing or degradation of tumor-POMC mRNA. Cytoplasmic dot blot hybridization of tumor mRNA with POMC cDNA yielded a positive signal with increasing amounts of RNA blotted. Immunohistochemistry and radioimmunoassay (RIA) of ACTH, in vitro regulation of ACTH secretion, and expression of POMC mRNA species by this tumor document expression of the human POMC gene by an islet carcinoma associated with Cushing's syndrome.\r"

In primary breast cancers there was no difference in levels of aromatase activity when analyzed by menstrual status or age by decade. Aromatase activity was similar in small and large primary tumors. The median aromatase activity of primary breast tumors (8.6 pmol/g/h) was similar to that found in metastatic breast cancer deposits (12.0 pmol/g/h). Aromatase activity did not correlate with either estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) receptor concentration in the tissues assayed. In this regard there were 33 ER- PR- tumor biopsies. Twelve of these 33 tumors contained aromatase activity greater than 10 pmol/g/hour.\r"

The incidences of such lesions were 10.9% and 68.0% in those given and not given preoperative irradiation, respectively. The 222 tumors were grouped into five categories, according to depth of invasion of the main lesion, those restricted to the mucosa, submucosa, proper muscular layer, and those invading the adventitia and neighboring structures. The rates of occurrence of intra-epithelial carcinoma were 87.5, 65.0, 26.9, 18.8, and 17.7%, respectively. Of the 67 with intra-epithelial carcinoma, the incidences of both proximal and distal location of such lesions were 85.7% in mucosal carcinoma, 84.6% in submucosal carcinoma, 71.4% in cancer restricted to the proper muscular layer, 50.0% in cancer invading the adventitia, and 9.1% in cancer invading the neighboring structures. Intra-epithelial carcinoma may thus originate from field carcinomatous transformation rather than from an intra-epithelial spread of the main lesions. These observations also support the concept of the field origin of carcinogenesis in the esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "Prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN, or intraductal dysplasia) is considered a precursor of invasive carcinoma, characterized by proliferation and anaplasia of cells lining prostatic ducts and acini. The highest grade of PIN, Grade 3, is thought to represent carcinoma in situ. To quantitate the degree of disruption of the basal cell layer in human prostatic ducts and acini as a potential marker of early invasion in PIN, a monoclonal antibody to keratin proteins of 49, 51, 57, and 66 kd which selectively labels the prostatic basal cell layer was used. A total of 1093 acini with PIN were identified in 14 cases with invasive carcinoma. Tumor cells consistently failed to be decorated with this antibody. The frequency of disruption of the basal cell layer increased with increasing grades of PIN, with disruption present in 0.7% of cases of PIN 1, 15% of cases of PIN 2, and 56% of cases of PIN 3. The amount of disruption of the basal cell layer also increased with increasing grades of PIN, with loss of more than one third of the basal layer in 52% of foci of PIN 3 compared with less than 2% in lower grades of PIN. Disruption of the basal layer was more common in acini adjacent to invasive carcinoma than in distant acini. These findings suggest that early invasion in prostate cancer is characterized by disruption of the basal layer, and that invasion occurs commonly in association with foci of high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) of pregnancy can be separated into several variants by an isoelectric focusing (IEF) method. The hCG produced by choriocarcinoma consists of components found in pregnancy sera (pI 3.9-6.0) and, in addition, unique variants with more acidic isoelectric points ranging from 3.2 to 3.7. The sera of all five patients with advanced choriocarcinoma contained these unique acidic variants of hCG and the immunoreactive levels were significantly higher in these patients than in normal pregnant women or patients afflicted with hydatidiform mole or invasive mole. When the acidic variants of hCG were treated with neuraminidase they migrated to the alkaline region (pI 9-11) of the IEF column. In conclusion, sera of choriocarcinoma patients contain unique variants of hCG. The finding that these highly acidic components can be converted to molecules with an alkaline pI by neuraminidase digestion suggests that this high negative charge may be due to an increased sialic acid content. Patients possessing the acidic variants of hCG in their sera had poor survival rate. Determination of the variants may be useful as a prognosis marker and in evaluating the efficacy of therapy.\r"

Clinical pubertal progression was normal in all patients, and three of five girls with advanced pubertal development had menarche. No evidences of gonadotropin disturbances were found in five patients whereas seven had raised basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level or FSH response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH). Abnormalities in thyrotrophin (TSH) secretion were found in 9 of 13 patients. This study shows that poor growth and GH deficiency were frequent in our patients.

This report describes five of seven patients in whom endobronchial lesions consistent with submucosal involvement by the tumor were seen, and Kaposi's sarcoma was diagnosed without complication. Kaposi's sarcoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary disease in patients with a proven extrapulmonary tumor focus, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma may be a marker for parenchymal involvement by the tumor. Diagnosis of endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma can be an important factor in decisions regarding therapy.\r"

Correlations between sex, age, duration of symptoms, site of tumors, lymph node metastases, stage of tumors, operability, resectability, treatment and survival were attempted. With respect to age, of the patients not operated on, survival was longer for more advanced age; the opposite occurred for the group of patients who were operated on. The impairment of lymph nodes was decisive in shortening survival; men were affected more than women and had a worse prognosis. When the tumors were located in the proximal third of the stomach, the survival rate was longer than when they were located in the distal portion and middle third of the stomach. Patients who had experienced digestive symptoms for a long time survived longer than those with a short history. It was concluded that the main prognostic factor was resectability and, regardless of any other variables, only patients from the group submitted to gastric resection survived more than 5 years.\r"

In the patients with colon cancer, a significant adverse effect of transfusion on long-term survival was seen. In this group there was a cumulative 5-year overall survival of 48% for the transfused and 74% for the nontransfused patients (P = 0.007, log-rank test). Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with a relative risk of 3.42 for all deaths (P = 0.005) and 4.25 for death due to cancer (P = 0.03), after adjustment for other important variables such as age, sex, stage, location of tumor, surgical procedure, and preoperative hemoglobin level. In contrast, in our study group of patients with breast cancers, who all underwent a modified radical mastectomy, no effect of blood transfusion on long-term survival was seen. Multivariate analysis adjusting for size of tumor, number of positive regional lymph nodes, menopausal status, estrogen receptor status and the addition or absence of chemotherapy, did not show any increased risk in all deaths or death due to cancer associated with blood transfusion. Although no definite explanation is available, our data show that there seems to be a difference in the relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and survival for colon and breast cancer patients.\r"

Adjuvant drugs can be added to each step. This report presents the 2-year experience of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the National Cancer Institute of Milan in the use of this method. This retrospective study shows that a correct use of the analgesic ladder can reduce pain to a third of its initial intensity. The use of non-opioids had an average duration of 19.2 days; in 52% of the cases treatment was discontinued due to inefficacy and in 42%, to side effects. Weak opioids were administered on an average for 28.0 days. A shift to Strong opioids was made in 92% of the cases due to inefficacy and in 8% because of side effects. Treatment with strong opioids lasted for an average of 46.6 days and can be considered the mainstay of cancer pain therapy. Performance status was not altered considerably during the study and hours of sleep were doubled. The analgesic ladder proved efficacious in 71% of the cases. Neurolytic procedures had to be used in 29%. The authors conclude that analgesics, as proposed by WHO, are the most suitable treatment arm in controlling pain in palliative treatment for advanced cancer patients. Lack of availability or underuse of opioids constitute the real obstacle to the application of this method.\r"

The incidence among men was significantly greater than among women in all ethnic groups. There was a distinct peak for small noncleaved cell type among white boys but not girls. For all other histologic types, there was a conspicuous absence of a young adult component, with incidence increasing steadily with age. No evidence for seasonal fluctuation in month of diagnosis was found.

  ".W": "The nationwide screening program for cervical carcinoma in The Netherlands was unique in that all women between the age of 35 and 55 years were individually invited to undergo a cervical spatula smear. The total rate of positive histologic findings in six regions of the country was 3.9 per thousand, and decreased in the second screening after 3 years with 48% of patients. Further analysis of the change in rates of the separate histologic subgroups in six regions revealed: Severe dysplasia showed no change in rates. The rates of carcinoma in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma were influenced clearly by the screening. The preinvasive stages of adenocarcinoma of the cervix were underdiagnosed in the first screening, and there was no decrease in the score of invasive adenocarcinoma. The rates in the six regions differed significantly and were dependent on the degree of urbanization. Cervical screening using the Ayre spatula is not effective for detecting cervical adenocarcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cholesterol-feeding in the presence of dipyridamole (0.60 g daily) on contractile responses and on endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations in isolated rabbit aortas are described. The investigations were performed simultaneously with those described in Part I (Circ Res 1986; 58:552-564), where the effects of cholesterol feeding on vascular reactivity in rabbit arteries (n = 8 in each group) selected at random from the same group of animals was studied. In the hypercholesterolemic rabbits treated with dipyridamole for 8 or 16 weeks, both the increases in plasma cholesterol and the formation of fatty streaks were significantly less pronounced than in the hypercholesterolemic rabbits not receiving the drug. Segments of the isolated arteries were mounted in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. The contractions caused by acetylcholine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, norepinephrine, clonidine, and serotonin and the endothelium-independent relaxations to nitroglycerin were not significantly altered by the hypercholesterolemia in rabbits treated with dipyridamole, even after 16 weeks of treatment. Thus, the decreased responses to norepinephrine, clonidine, and nitroglycerin and the augmented responses to serotonin noted in aortas of hypercholesterolemic rabbits in Part I were absent in the dipyridamole-treated hypercholesterolemic animals. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to ATP and acetylcholine were not affected after 8 weeks of hypercholesterolemia in presence of dipyridamole, while after 16 weeks the relaxations to ATP and acetylcholine were attenuated only in the more severely affected arteries. The effects of hypercholesterolemia + dipyridamole on endothelium-dependent relaxations were significantly less pronounced than those induced by hypercholesterolemia alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A good spatial resolution was obtained by using the blood platelets as small and natural markers of flow, providing for the first time in vivo detailed, quantitative information about the shape of the velocity profiles in microvessels. In some experiments red blood cell velocity profiles were recorded as well. Easy detection of the cells of interest could be achieved by labelling them selectively with a fluorescent dye and visualizing them by intravital fluorescence video microscopy, using flashed illumination. Pairs of flashes were given with a short, preset time interval between both flashes, yielding in one TV picture two images of the same cell displaced over a certain distance for the given time interval. Velocity and mean radial position of cells, flowing within an optical section around the median plane of the vessel, were determined. The shape of the velocity profiles of platelets and red blood cells was similar. The profiles were flattened as compared to a parabola, both in systole and diastole. Vessel diameter did not change measurably during the cardiac cycle. As an index of the degree of blunting of the profiles, the ratio of the maximal and mean velocity of the profile was used, which is 2 for a parabola and 1 for complete plug flow. The index ranged from 1.39 to 1.54 (median 1.50), and increased with vessel diameter. Calculations showed that the blunting of the profiles cannot be explained by an influence of the finite depth of the optical section.\r"

  ".U": "87103475\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in diastolic chamber distensibility (DCD) during hypoxemia and ischemia were studied in isolated-buffer-perfused rabbit hearts. Two minutes of hypoxemia (low PO2 coronary flow) resulted in a shift of the diastolic pressure-volume curve to the left, i.e., distensibility was decreased (hypoxemic contracture). In contrast, 2 minutes of ischemia (zero coronary flow) resulted in an initial shift of the diastolic pressure-volume curve to the right indicating increased distensibility, which was followed by a later (30 minutes) shift to the left (ischemic contracture). Two minutes of ischemia superimposed on hypoxemia caused complete reversal of contracture. A quick stretch and release applied to the myocardium reversed late ischemic contracture but did not effect early hypoxemic contracture. The role of intracellular pH in modulating changes in DCD during hypoxia and ischemia was studied using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of isolated-buffer-perfused rat hearts that demonstrated changes in DCD similar to rabbit hearts during hypoxemia and ischemia. Intracellular pH decreased from 7.03 +/- 0.02 to 6.87 +/- 0.03 (p less than .01) during 2 minutes of ischemia but did not change significantly during 4 minutes of hypoxemia. When 2 minutes of ischemia were superimposed on hypoxemia, pH decreased from 6.99 +/- 0.01 during hypoxemia to 6.88 +/- 0.02 after 2 minutes of ischemia (p less than .01), concomitant with the complete reversal of hypoxemic contracture. These results suggest different mechanisms for late ischemic and early hypoxemic contracture and also suggest an explanation for the opposite initial changes in DCD seen after brief periods of ischemia and hypoxemia. The early development of contracture during hypoxemia and rapid redevelopment of diastolic tension after quick stretching are consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxemic contracture results from persistent Ca++-activated diastolic tension secondary to impaired calcium resequestration by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the late development of contracture during global ischemia and reversal by quick stretching is compatible with rigor bond formation. The initial increase in distensibility during early ischemia and the reversal of hypoxemic contracture by a brief period of superimposed ischemia probably is the result of two factors present during ischemia but not during hypoxemia: the collapse of the coronary vasculature and loss of the \"erectile\" effect and, the rapid development of intracellular acidosis, which has been shown to affect myofibrillar calcium sensitivity, and this may lead to a decrease in Ca++ activated diastolic tension.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of sympathetic innervation on the growth and intrinsic rate of beating established by fetal rat heart was studied by culturing fetal atrial tissue in sympathetically innervated and denervated anterior eye chambers of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. One anterior eye chamber in each host rat was sympathetically denervated by removing the ipsilateral superior cervical ganglion. In oculo, atrial grafts were vascularized by blood vessels sprouting from the iris and innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers from the ground plexus of the iris. Innervation was assessed by light-activated efferent nerve stimulation to the grafts that changed their rates of beating. The norepinephrine contents of 16 atria cultured for 2.5 months in sympathetically innervated and denervated eye chambers were 5.7 +/- 1.1 ng/implant vs. 0.2 +/- 0.07 ng/implant (mean +/- SEM), indicating permanent sympathetic denervation of the anterior eye chamber and the implanted atria. By 8 weeks in oculo, atria maturing in sympathetically innervated anterior eye chambers were 86% larger than those in denervated eye chambers (2.22 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.13 mm2); the weight of innervated transplants was over 3 times that of noninnervated grafts (2.35 +/- 0.75 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.21 mg). After implanted atria had ceased growing rapidly (2.5 months in oculo), bipolar electrodes were implanted adjacent to the cornea to record impulses from atrial grafts while host rats were unanesthetized. The dark-adapted baseline heart rates of sympathetically innervated and noninnervated atria were virtually identical (289 vs. 290 bpm). Graft intrinsic heart rate was estimated by combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockade with atenolol (1.0 mg/kg) and methylatropine (10 micrograms/kg). Sympathetically innervated transplants had lower intrinsic heart rates than noninnervated atria (134 +/- 25 vs. 213 +/- 12 bpm). These data suggest that sympathetic innervation of the developing heart influences both growth and intrinsic rate of beating.\r"

  ".W": "Neural crest cells are known to contribute to the normal architecture of the heart and aortic arch arteries. Ablation of neural crest cells over somites 1 to 3 in the chick embryo prevents conotruncal septation and results in persistent truncus arteriosus. To determine whether a deficiency of cardiac neural crest cells produces hemodynamic changes prior to the development of identifiable structural defects in the heart, we measured dorsal aortic blood velocity and vitelline artery blood pressure in lesioned and control embryos at a period of cardiac morphogenesis prior to septal formation. The internal diameter of the dorsal aorta at the level of the sinus venosus and the internal diameter of the aortic arch arteries at their midpoints were measured in embryos at Stage 18 of development using a filar micrometer eyepiece and a dissecting microscope. Embryos with neural crest lesions had significantly greater dorsal aortic blood flow velocity than control embryos. In addition, embryos lacking cardiac neural crest had significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures than control embryos. There was no difference in heart rate, dorsal aortic diameter or internal diameter of the aortic arch arteries between lesioned and control embryos. Scanning electron micrographs revealed no gross morphological differences in cardiac looping or conotruncal wall development between lesioned and control embryos; however, embryos with cardiac neural crest ablations developed markedly hypoplastic 4th pharyngeal arches. This data suggests that hemodynamic changes precede the onset of structural heart defects in embryos with cardiac neural crest ablations.\r"

We have looked for isoactin changes, using deoxyribonucleic acid probes complementary to alpha-skeletal and alpha-cardiac actin messenger ribonucleic acids. Three groups of rats were studied at various days after application of a pressure overload (2-4 days, n = 13, 8-15 days, n = 5, and 30-40 days, n = 7) and were compared to control animals (n = 11). Whereas alpha-skeletal actin messenger ribonucleic acids were hardly detectable in the normal hearts (0.6 +/- 0.16%), they accumulated significantly in the first 4 days after the aortic stenosis (4.6 +/- 3.1%, p less than 0.001 vs. controls) and then slowly declined (8-15 days, 3.2 +/- 1.7% and 30-40 days, 1.6 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.05 and NS vs. controls). This figure is similar to that observed in 8-day-old rats (2.27 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.01 vs. controls). We conclude that, in rat myocardium, the expression of messenger ribonucleic acids encoding the sarcomeric actins is altered at the onset of a pressure overload hypertrophy. Although the physiological significance of isoactin changes is unknown, our results show that the thin filament participates as well as the thick filament in the response of cardiac muscle to new functional requirements.\r"

Peak total tension (7.2 +/- 1.6 versus 7.9 +/- 1.7 g/mm2, p = NS) and peak velocity of tension development (31 +/- 8 vs. 28 +/- 4 g/mm2/sec, p = NS) were similar in both groups of muscles. However, right ventricular muscles shortened faster over nearly all loading conditions, and during isometric contraction, their time to attain peak total tension was shorter (336 +/- 26 vs. 401 +/- 42 msec, p less than 0.005) than that of left ventricular muscles. Varying stimulation rates (6, 12, 24, and 36 stimuli/min), increasing calcium concentration from 2.54 to 6.35 mM or adding norepinephrine 50 microM, did not significantly alter these differences. There were no differences in myosin isozymes (V1, V2, or V3) between ventricles to explain these differences. These results indicate that important mechanical differences exist between right and left ventricular myocardium and that these differences should be considered when extrapolations are made from myocardium of one area of the heart to another.\r"

Peak oxygen uptake (VO2) during upright bicycle exercise improved from 29.2 +/- 5.6 to 34.7 +/- 6.7 ml/kg/min (mean +/- SD, p less than .01) because of similar increases in peak cardiac output (CO) and calculated arteriovenous oxygen difference (both p = .02). Peak supine VO2 was 10% higher after training (p less than .005) solely because of enhanced CO (p = .005). Peak heart rate decreased in both postures; therefore stroke volume at peak exercise was greater by 10% and 18% in the upright and supine postures, respectively (p = .05 and p = .005). There was an identical 18% rise (p = .01) in peak supine left ventricular end-diastolic volume index by radionuclide ventriculography but no change in left ventricular ejection fraction or end-systolic volume index (ESVI). Peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) was unchanged in the upright posture but was 8% higher (p = .002) during recumbency despite a similar total peripheral resistance and SBP/ESVI ratio. Maximal calf conductance (Gmax), assessed separately by venous occlusion plethysmography after local ischemic exercise to fatigue, was augmented 20% (p less than .02) by training, resulting in an 18% greater hyperemic blood flow (p = .05). Peak VO2, CO, and Gmax were unchanged in five nonexercising control subjects. We conclude that in middle-aged humans, intense swim training for 12 weeks produces adaptations that include a greater capacity for vasodilatation in skeletal muscle and an enhanced cardiac pump capacity.\r"

Although peak isometric force generated in response to increased extracellular calcium reached control levels in the muscles from patients with heart failure, the time course of contraction and rate of relaxation were greatly prolonged. The inotropic effectiveness of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors milrinone, caffeine, and isobutylmethylxanthine was markedly reduced in muscles from the patients with heart failure. In contrast, the effectiveness of inotropic stimulation with acetylstrophanthidin and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin was preserved. After a minimally effective dose of forskolin was given to elevate intracellular cyclic AMP levels, the inotropic responses of muscles from the failing hearts to phosphodiesterase inhibitors were markedly potentiated. These data indicate that an abnormality in cyclic AMP production may be a fundamental defect present in patients with end-stage heart failure that can markedly diminish the effectiveness of agents that depend on generation of this nucleotide for production of a positive inotropic effect.\r"

Group 1, 3.3% of the total, contained those participants who had postural hypotension. The 5 year total and age-adjusted mortality rates for these groups were significantly different (p less than .04), with group 1 having the highest rates. To account for the possible confounding effects of certain baseline risk factors--age, sex, race, prior antihypertensive treatment, randomization group, diabetes, end-organ damage, sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse, hematocrit, smoking status, and relative weight (percent of ideal weight)--in assessing group differences in mortality rates, a multiple logistic model was used. Relative weight proved to be a confounding factor for the association of drop in postural systolic blood pressure with mortality. However, there is an interaction between history of diabetes and postural change in systolic blood pressure. Thus, postural hypotension may indicate a poor prognosis in diabetic hypertensive patients.\r"

Seven adult patients with uncomplicated Ebstein's anomaly were studied. Left ventricular geometry was determined by two-dimensional echocardiography. Left ventricular function was assessed by treadmill exercise and radionuclide angiography at rest and with exercise. Paradoxic ventricular septal motion was consistently present. Left ventricular eccentricity (ratio of two minor axes in the short-axis view) was uniformly abnormal, averaging 1.35 +/- 0.23 (normal = 1.02 +/- 0.05). The ratio of right to left ventricular cavity size averaged 1.70 +/- 0.44 (normal 0.65 +/- 0.30), and tricuspid valve displacement into the right ventricular cavity averaged 52% (normal 8%). Functional right atrial size averaged 27.6 +/- 5.2 cm2 (normal right atrial area = 13.1 +/- 2.2 cm2). Resting left ventricular ejection fractions were below 50% in all but two patients. In response to Bruce protocol exercise stress, there were consistently appropriate increments in heart rate, blood pressure, and peak double product and, with one exception, radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction. There were significant correlations between tricuspid valve displacement and functional right atrial size versus resting left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular eccentricity. These data support the hypothesis that derangements in right heart morphology and function in Ebstein's anomaly contribute to significant alterations in left ventricular geometry, but the geometric alterations are associated with tangible but less significant changes in left ventricular systolic function.\r"

During cardiac catheterization, oxygen consumption (VO2), arterial and venous blood gases and oxygen saturations (range 41% to 98%), hemoglobin concentration, diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and P50 levels were measured, and then cardiac output, systemic oxygen transport (SOT), arterial and venous oxygen contents, and the VO2/SOT ratio (fractional O2 extraction) were calculated. P50 averaged 31 mm Hg, compared with 27 mm Hg in 10 control children (p less than .01). The composite O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve in vivo was broad: Po2 varied from 37 to 65 mm Hg at 80% saturation. P50, 2,3-DPG, hemoglobin concentrations, and O2 saturation varied widely and inconsistently with Po2 and arterial and venous O2 content, but resulted in clustering of the arterial oxygen content near 165 +/- 23 (SD) ml/liter over a wide range of Po2 and hemoglobin concentrations. SOT varied in direct relation with flow (r = .82, p less than .001), but not with oxygen content, Po2, or P50. VO2 varied widely at normal or high levels of SOT, but decreased linearly at SOT levels below 400 ml/min/m2. Oxygen extraction varied inversely with venous O2 content, rising to about 50% and plateauing below venous contents of 100 ml/liter. O2 extraction did not correlate with Po2, arterial O2 content, or P50. These data suggest that: O2 saturation cannot be predicted or calculated accurately from measured Po2, but must be measured directly, 2,3-DPG, hemoglobin concentration, and P50 fluctuate to stabilize arterial oxygen content, SOT is determined primarily by cardiac output in subjects who are adapted chronically, O2 extraction rises, due to a fall in venous O2 content, to maintain VO2 as transport falls, below a critical level of SOT, O2 extraction ceases to rise and VO2 falls with further reduction in transport.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that an area of slow conduction is present during reentrant ventricular tachycardia in man, and that the earliest activation site during ventricular tachycardia is within or orthodromically just distal to the area of slow conduction in the reentry loop, we studied 12 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (mean rate 185 +/- 32 beats/min) that were induced in nine patients with ischemic heart disease. Rapid ventricular pacing was performed at selected sites during ventricular tachycardia while recording electrograms from an early activation site relative to the onset of the QRS complex (site A) and from a site close to the pacing site (site B). Rapid pacing from the right ventricular apex during ventricular tachycardia with a right bundle branch block pattern and from selected left ventricular sites during ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block pattern (mean pacing rate 202 +/- 38 beats/min) resulted in constant ventricular fusion beats on the electrocardiogram except for the last captured beat (i.e., the ventricular tachycardia was entrained) in 11 of 12 episodes. During entrainment: sites A and B were activated at the pacing rate, conduction time from the last pacing impulse to the last captured ventricular electrogram at site A (St-A interval) was 359 +/- 69 msec and spanned the diastolic interval, while that at site B (St-B interval) was only 28 +/- 13 msec, site A had the same ventricular electrogram morphology as that during ventricular tachycardia, while site B had a different electrogram morphology, indicating that site A was activated in the same direction during entrainment as during ventricular tachycardia. Eight episodes of ventricular tachycardia were entrained at two or more different pacing rates. The St-A interval increased during pacing at the faster rate(s) in four of eight episodes, while the St-B interval remained unchanged. Rapid ventricular pacing performed from the same site during sinus rhythm (mean pacing rate 201 +/- 37 beats/min) resulted in an St-A interval of 103 +/- 37 msec (p less than .001 vs the value during entrainment) and an St-B interval of 31 +/- 15 msec (p = NS vs the value during entrainment). It is concluded that an area of slow conduction not demonstrable during sinus rhythm exists during ventricular tachycardia, and that the earliest activation site during ventricular tachycardia is at or orthodromically distal to this area of slow conduction.\r"

We used a contact electrode catheter to record monophasic action potentials (MAPs) from 54 left ventricular endocardial sites during cardiac catheterization (seven patients) and a new contact electrode probe to record MAPs from 23 epicardial sites during cardiac surgery (three patients). All patients had normal left ventricular function and ECGs with concordant T waves. MAP recordings during constant sinus rhythm or right atrial pacing were analyzed for activation time (AT) = earliest QRS deflection to MAP upstroke, action potential duration (APD) = MAP upstroke to 90% repolarization, and repolarization time (RT) = AT plus APD. AT and APD varied by 32 and 64 msec, respectively, over the left ventricular endocardium and by 55 and 73 msec, respectively, over the left ventricular epicardium. On a regional basis, the diaphragmatic and apicoseptal endocardium had the shortest AT and the longest APD, and the anteroapical and posterolateral endocardium had the longest AT and the shortest APD (p less than .05 to less than .0001). RT was less heterogeneous than APD, and no significant transventricular gradients of RT were found. In percent of the simultaneously recorded QT interval, epicardial RT ranged from 70.8 to 87.4 (mean 80.7 +/- 3.9) and endocardial RT ranged from 80 to 97.8 (mean 87.1 +/- 4.4) (p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aneurysms were confirmed by selective coronary angiography in 27 patients and by postmortem examination in one. The 27 surviving patients with proven aneurysms were followed for 2 to 40 months (mean 15), during which they received low dose (5 to 10 mg/kg) aspirin daily. Progressive improvement and resolution of aneurysms were observed by serial echocardiography in 18 patients and confirmed by angiography in 14. Coronary aneurysms persisted, however, in nine other patients for 14 to 40 months (mean 25.7). The incidence of aneurysm resolution was higher in children less than 1 year of age at the onset of the illness than in patients older than 1 year (100% vs 50%; p less than .001). Aneurysms were more likely to resolve in girls than in boys (100% vs 42%; p less than .001). Fusiform aneurysms tended to resolve more frequently than saccular lesions (80% vs 18%; p less than .025). Aneurysms located distally in the coronary arteries appear to regress more rapidly than proximal ones. We conclude that an age of less than 1 year at the onset of Kawasaki syndrome, female sex, and fusiform aneurysm morphology are significant factors that favor resolution of coronary artery aneurysms. However, important questions remain with regard to the long-term fate and functional capabilities of these healed lesions.\r"

A total of 251 episodes of ischemic ST segment depression occurred in 24 (75%) of the 32 patients with a median duration of 5 min (range 1 to 253). A significant circadian increase in ischemic activity was found with 39% of episodes and 46% of total ischemic time occurring between 6 A.M. and 12 P.M. (p less than .05 and p = .02, respectively). In 21 patients with ST segment depression during the 6 hr after waking and the 6 hr before sleep, 68% of episodes occurred in the morning compared with 32% in the evening. There were no significant differences in heart rate at onset, heart rate at 1 min before onset, and activity score associated with ST segment depression. The proportion of minutes showing ST segment depression when the heart rate was above the lowest rate associated with ST segment depression was significantly greater in the morning compared with the evening (26% vs 15%; p = .03). Thus the early morning increase in ST segment depression does not appear to be explained by differences in extrinsic activity and/or stress measured by physical activity score and heart rate response. More importantly, this phenomenon is often ignored by the usual patterns of drug administration for angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Interobserver variability, if high, could explain conflicting reports. To assess this possibility, we submitted biopsy specimens from 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy to seven cardiac pathologists. The same slides were independently reviewed by each and assessed for fibrosis, hypertrophy, nuclear changes on a 0 to 3+ scale, mean lymphocyte count per high-power field, and myocarditis. The prevalance of significant fibrosis ranged from 25% to 69%, hypertrophy from 19% to 88%, nuclear changes from 31% to 94%, and abnormal lymphocyte count from 0 to 38%. One or more pathologists diagnosed definite or possible myocarditis in 11 of the 16 patients. Of these 11 patients, three pathologists agreed about three and two pathologists agreed about five. Myocarditis was diagnosed by a single pathologist in three cases. We conclude that interobserver variability is high in interpreting biopsy specimens from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and that quantitative and standardized methods are needed to increase diagnostic consistency.\r"

The feasibility of detection and quantitation of fetal ductal constriction by Doppler echocardiography was assessed in an animal preparation in which ductal constriction was created in the fetal lamb with a variable ligature causing varying degrees of fetal pulmonary hypertension (fetal pulmonary arterial systolic pressure 57 to 97 mm Hg and ductal gradient 9 to 42 mm Hg). Comparison of blinded, continuous-wave peak Doppler velocity (V) measurements of the ductal gradient with the modified Bernoulli assumption (gradient = 4V2) compared well with direct catheter measurements of instantaneous peak systolic gradient (r = .99, catheter = 0.95 X Doppler + 0.6), peak-to-peak gradient (r = .97), and mid-diastolic gradient (r = .85). Ductal constriction was characterized by an increase in the peak systolic and diastolic velocities. The normal human fetal ductus arteriosus blood flow velocity pattern was assessed by pulsed Doppler techniques in 25 normal human fetuses after 20 weeks gestation. The peak systolic flow velocity in the ductus arteriosus measured by image-directed pulsed Doppler echocardiography ranged from 50 to 141 cm/sec (mean 80 cm/sec) and increased with gestational age (r = .50). Diastolic velocity in the ductus arteriosus was consistently directed toward the descending aorta and ranged from 6 to 30 cm/sec. The ductal systolic velocities were the highest blood flow velocities in the fetal cardiovascular system. Application of these techniques to fetuses whose mothers were receiving indomethacin for treatment of premature labor at 30 to 31 weeks gestation confirmed this method to be sensitive for detection of fetal ductal constriction, which developed in three fetuses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed before, during, and immediately after an exercise test by the Bruce protocol. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to determine the ejection fraction and new wall motion abnormalities. The peak ejection velocity, stroke index, and cardiac index were calculated from the pulsed Doppler tracing. In normal subjects the ejection fraction increased significantly (p less than .001) from rest (0.51 +/- 0.07) to peak exercise (0.61 +/- 0.07), while the response in coronary patients was blunted (0.49 +/- 0.11 vs 0.48 +/- 0.16). Similarly, the change in peak ejection velocity throughout exercise in normal subjects (from 0.71 +/- 0.12 to 1.50 +/- 0.35 m/sec) was significantly (p less than .01) greater than that in patients with coronary artery disease (from 0.61 +/- 0.13 to 0.90 +/- 0.29 m/sec). There was a good correlation between the percent change in peak ejection velocity and the percent change in ejection fraction from rest to peak exercise in the entire study group (rs = .64) and in the patients with coronary artery disease (rs = .84). These preliminary data suggest that exercise-induced changes in Doppler echocardiographic variables may offer a potential adjunct in the evaluation of patients with ischemic heart disease.\r"

Surgery was performed in patients on cardiopulmonary bypass without cardiac arrest; the pulmonary artery was reconstructed by end-to-end anastomosis according to Lecompte's maneuver with a pericardial patch. In all but one patient coronary artery transfer was possible regardless of the distribution of these vessels. There were eight early deaths (16%), but only four (10%) of the last 41 patients treated died. There was one late death (2%) due to a secondary myocardial infarction caused by compression of the left coronary artery. Reoperation was successfully performed in two patients for supravalvar pulmonary artery stenosis. The only late medical complication was a transient episode of myocardial ischemia 6 months after surgery. The 41 late survivors were in excellent condition, were in sinus rhythm, and had a normal left ventricle 1 to 22 months after surgery (mean 7.2 +/- 5.4 [SD]). Aortic growth was normal; pulmonary artery supravalvar stenosis occurred in six patients (mild in four). We conclude that anatomic correction can be applied successfully in the first few days of life in newborns with simple transposition of the great arteries, regardless of coronary distribution.\r"

One group of dogs with CHF was given normal saline as pretreatment, while the other two groups were pretreated with either propranolol alone (beta-blockade) or propranolol plus prazosin (alpha- plus beta-blockade). CHF was characterized by weight gain, ascites, elevated right atrial pressure, tachycardia, and reduced cardiac output. Compared with sham-operated animals, animals with CHF exhibited significantly higher baseline levels of plasma beta-endorphin and cortisol. Furthermore, only the animals with CHF responded to the opiate receptor-antagonist nalmefene with significant increases in plasma beta-endorphin, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Administration of nalmefene increased aortic blood pressure, cardiac output, left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P, and blood flow to the myocardium, skeletal muscle, and kidneys in dogs with CHF, but had no appreciable effects in sham-operated dogs. beta-Receptor blockade abolished the increase in cardiac output, left ventricular performance, and blood flow produced by nalmefene, but had no effect on the pressor response to nalmefene. The increase in mean aortic pressure in the beta-blockade group was accompanied by an increase in skeletal muscle vascular resistance. Addition of prazosin in the alpha- plus beta-blockade group abolished the increases in mean aortic pressure and skeletal muscle vascular resistance, suggesting that the changes after propranolol probably resulted from unmasking of alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative coronary arteriography has been shown to be useful in assessing the extent of coronary disease, its functional significance, and its response to therapeutic interventions. Most current methods rely either on hand-drawn arterial contours or automatic edge-detection algorithms applied to 35 mm cineangiograms. To assess the performance in vivo of a new, fully automatic, rapid coronary quantitation program, dogs were instrumented with precision-drilled, plastic cylinders to create intraluminal stenoses in the left anterior descending and/or circumflex arteries, as well as with high-fidelity micromanometers and electromagnetic flow probes. Stenosis diameters ranged from 0.83 to 1.83 mm. Biplane, on-line, digital coronary angiograms and cineangiograms were recorded during standard selective coronary arteriography in the closed-chest preparation. The on-line digital images were analyzed in nonsubtracted and subtracted modes. Cineangiograms were digitized to allow coronary quantitation by the same computer program. There was an excellent correlation between known and measured minimal diameter stenoses (r = .87 to .98, SEE = 0.09 to 0.24 mm). Interobserver and intraobserver variability analysis showed high reproducibility (r = .90 to .97, SEE = 0.12 to 0.23 mm). The best results in both analyses were achieved by nonsubtracted digital imaging and the worst by cineradiography. Measures of percent diameter stenosis, percent area stenosis (geometric and videometric), and absolute minimal cross-sectional area (geometric and videometric) were all significantly correlated with independent measures of actual coronary flow reserve. This study provides direct anatomic and physiologic validation in vivo of a new and rapid coronary quantitation method suitable for analysis of both digital angiograms and cineangiograms.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that subjective assessment of the severity of coronary artery stenoses results in poor interobserver concordance and poor correlation with physiologic significance as determined by Doppler measurements of coronary flow reserve. Use of the coronary flow reserve as an integrated measure of the effect of stenosis geometry has been emphasized within the context of quantitative cinemetric analysis. The comparison of two parametric digital subtraction angiographic flow images obtained before and after hyperemic intervention has led to calculation of flow reserve values that correlate well with electromagnetic flowmeter data in dogs. By means of a similar model relating blood flow and image variables, single flow ratio images have been formed. These parametric images provide a two-dimensional display of the ratio of hyperemic flow to baseline flow. Linear temporal interpolation of data from a sequence of cardiac phase-matched subtraction images is used to improve the resolution of the displayed flow ratios. Summation of flow variables measured within the perfusion bed was used to calculate a value for the overall coronary flow reserve and to characterize the significance of isolated lesions in an open-chest canine preparation. A linear regression calculation relating parametric image flow ratio values to electromagnetic flowmeter measurements resulted in a linear fit of y = .96x - 0.19 with a correlation coefficient of .90. The direct visual representation of flow ratio distribution provided by the parametric imaging method may aid in the interpretation of multiple complex lesions as well as of single lesions.\r"

Normal hemodynamics were maintained with infusion of arterial blood and oxygenated Fluosol, whereas unoxygenated Fluosol and Plasmalyte A resulted in hemodynamic deterioration similar to that noted with no treatment. Ischemic zone systolic fractional area change, an index of systolic function measured by two-dimensional echocardiography, remained normal during the occlusion supplemented with intracoronary arterial blood (49 +/- 7%), was moderately hypokinetic with oxygenated Fluosol (31 +/- 10%), and became severely hypokinetic with unoxygenated Fluosol (14 +/- 14%), with Plasmalyte A (2 +/- 13%), and in the absence of treatment (5 +/- 9%). Only infusion of arterial blood resulted in no ST segment elevation or lactate production. Thus intracoronary infusion of arterial blood during brief coronary occlusion maintained normal myocardial function and aerobic metabolism. Infusion of oxygenated Fluosol resulted in amelioration of the decline in regional function after coronary occlusion, but not complete protection.\r"

  ".W": "There is now evidence that under resting conditions coronary vasodilator reserve exists even in the presence of myocardial ischemia. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a vasodilator reserve may exist during exercise so that during exercise-induced ischemia a reduction in coronary constrictor tone can be produced that attenuates the decreases in regional myocardial blood flow and function distal to a severe coronary stenosis without changing the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Nine dogs were instrumented with an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex coronary artery and were studied 2 to 3 weeks later. During a control treadmill run, heart rate increased from 119 +/- 20 to 225 +/- 20 beats/min and peak left ventricular pressure increased from 144 +/- 17 to 163 +/- 28 mm Hg. Poststenotic subendocardial blood flow (measured by a microsphere technique) fell from 1.19 +/- 0.36 to 0.51 +/- 0.30 ml/min X g and systolic wall thickening (by sonomicrometry) decreased from 24.3 +/- 5.8% to 6.0 +/- 6.1%. During an identical run after nifedipine (10 micrograms/kg iv), systemic hemodynamics were not significantly altered. However, subendocardial blood flow was increased to 0.85 +/- 0.51 ml/min X g (p less than .05) and systolic wall thickening to 11.4 +/- 7.8% (p less than .01). We conclude that in this study the amelioration of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was due to the recruitment by nifedipine of coronary vasodilator reserve.\r"

In this study we compared the effects of various doses of epinephrine on regional myocardial blood flow after a 10 min arrest in a swine preparation. Fifteen swine weighing greater than 15 kg each were instrumented for regional myocardial blood flow measurements with tracer microspheres. Regional blood flow was measured during normal sinus rhythm. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, CPR was begun and regional myocardial blood flow was determined. Animals were then randomly assigned to receive 0.02, 0.2, or 2.0 mg/kg epinephrine by peripheral injection. One minute after drug administration, regional myocardial blood flow measurements were repeated. The adjusted regional myocardial blood flows (ml/min/100 g) for animals given 0.02, 0.2, and 2.0 mg/kg epinephrine, respectively, were as follows: left atrium, 0.9, 67.4, and 58.8; right atrium, 0.3, 46.2, and 38.5; right ventricle, 0.7, 82.3, and 66.9; right interventricular septum, 1.7, 125.5, and 99.1; left interventricular septum, 2.8, 182.8, 109.5; mesointerventricular septum, 16.8, 142.2, and 79.2; left ventricular epicardium, 19.2, 98.5 and 108.7; left ventricular mesocardium, 22.8, 135.0, and 115.8; and left ventricular endocardium, 2.5, 176.1, and 132.9).

This study examined whether open-chest cardiac massage could improve 7 day survival and neurologic function when instituted after the failure of standard closed-chest compression CPR. Twenty-nine mongrel dogs were anesthetized and then instrumented with catheters to monitor right atrial and ascending aortic pressures. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and after 3 min standard CPR was begun. Standard CPR was performed with a Thumper programmed for 2 inch chest compressions at 60/min with a 50% duty cycle. External defibrillation was attempted twice after 15 min of ventricular fibrillation. Unsuccessfully defibrillated animals were randomly assigned to either an additional 2 min of continued closed-chest compressions, or 2 min of open-chest cardiac massage. All animals underwent a period of advanced cardiac life support and were followed until they were resuscitated or died. Follow-up care, including scoring of neurologic deficit, was performed for 7 days. In dogs receiving open-chest cardiac massage there was significantly more immediate resuscitation success (14/14 vs 5/14; p less than .005), 24 hr survival (12/14 vs 4/14; p less than .005), and 7 day survival (11/14 vs 4/14; p less than .02) than in those receiving continued closed-chest compression. Open-chest cardiac massage significantly improved long-term outcome when instituted after 15 min of ineffective closed-chest compression.\r"

Therapy changed in 25 (31%) of the patients. These results suggest that, overall, renal biopsy had a marked effect on management. However, we identified subgroups of patients who were unlikely to have their management changed as a result of the biopsy: of 16 patients with a pre-biopsy diagnosis of IgA nephropathy, 1 (6%) had treatment changed because of the biopsy; and of the 50 patients without heavy proteinuria (greater than 3 g/24 h), 10 (20%) had treatment changed because of the biopsy. Although our overall results suggest an important role for renal biopsy in clinical management, renal biopsy has the least apparent impact in patients with a pre-biopsy diagnosis of IgA nephropathy or without heavy proteinuria.\r"

The effects of beta-blockers on the glucose, alanine and free fatty acid responses to glucagon challenge (2 mg) in fourteen hemodialysis patients were studied. Patients on propranolol had impaired glycemic response while those on metoprolol had decreased response only before dialysis. There was a significant negative correlation between propranolol level (log-transformed) and glycemic responses, suggesting that propranolol has direct effect on the latter. Hemodialysis patients had fasting alanine levels comparable to those of normal subjects. After glucagon challenge, the decrements in alanine level had no consistent relationship to the impaired glycemic response. Thus suppression of gluconeogenesis is unlikely to be the prime cause of propranolol-induced hypoglycemia. The basal free fatty acid levels were significantly lower among hemodialysis patients on propranolol. This limited availability of free fatty acid as well as the inhibitory effect on hepatic glucagon-stimulated glucose output may contribute to the predisposition to hypoglycemia in dialysis patients given propranolol. The results suggest that metoprolol has less interference on energy substrate supply in hemodialysis patients under fasting conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Subclavian vein cannulation was suggested as a temporary vascular access for hemodialysis since one of its advantages was considered to be no damage to blood vessels. As we observed six patients with symptomatic subclavian vein thrombosis among 148 patients having received subclavian vein cannulation for hemodialysis, we systematically performed subclavian venogram in 42 asymptomatic patients selected on the basis of a history of previous subclavian vein cannulation. Venograms were performed 15.7 +/- 8.9 months after the removal of the last catheter. Eight patients (19%) had complete thrombosis or severe stenosis of the subclavian vein while six patients (14%) had minimal luminal defects. Considering together the 48 patients, the group with thrombosis or severe stenosis (group 1, n = 14) was compared with the group with minimal defects or normal venograms (group 2, n = 34). In group 1, as compared with group 2, there were more female (64% vs 32%, p = 0.02), more cannulations per vein (1.87 +/- 0.35 vs 1.32 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.05) and more cumulative days of cannulation per vein (35.1 +/- 7.9 vs 24.4 +/- 1.1, p less than 0.001). No difference between the two groups was seen for the number of catheter infections, the number of catheters with poor flow or obstruction, the coagulation screening of the patients or the time-length between the removal of the last catheter and the venogram study. Two of the initially asymptomatic patients developed later on clinical problems related to the subclavian vein thrombosis. We conclude that the subclavian vein cannulation leads to significant damages of the vessels, excluding a whole arm, for future vascular access in some patients.\r"

Ten unsupplemented dialysis patients served as controls. The mean plasma levels of vitamin C and oxalate were 3.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dl and 50.4 +/- 8.2 mumol/l respectively. Four weeks after the vitamin C dosage was changed from 500 to 100, 50 and 0 mg, plasma oxalate levels were 34.1 +/- 1.4, 33.3 +/- 3.7, and 25.7 +/- 3.9 mumol/l respectively. There was a strong correlation between plasma vitamin C and oxalate levels (r = 0.755, p less than 0.01) but none between pyridoxine and oxalate. A significant correlation was also noted between the duration of hemodialysis and plasma oxalate levels (r = 0.582, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that hyperoxalemia in regular hemodialysis patients is aggravated by routine vitamin C supplementation. The administration of vitamin C should be restricted to a dose necessary to correct vitamin C deficiency.\r"

This report comprises four patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent renal biopsy for declining renal function, proteinuria and active urine sediments. Pathology revealed that three patients had segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without significant glomerular immunoglobulin deposition. The fourth had segmental necrosis associated with diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis. We conclude that necrotizing glomerulonephritis is part of the spectrum of glomerular lesions seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Because of therapeutic considerations involving the use of cyclophosphamide, necrotizing glomerulonephritis should be a diagnostic consideration in the rheumatoid arthritis patient with signs of glomerulonephritis and rapidly deteriorating renal function.\r"

A low fractional distal chloride reabsorption (0.55 +/- 0.01) was found only in patients with Bartter's syndrome, whose serum potassium concentrations ranged between 1.2 and 3.1 mEq/l. Non-Bartter's syndrome hypokalemic patients had serum potassium concentrations between 2.4 and 3.2 mEq/l (p NS when compared to patients with Bartter's syndrome) but their fractional distal chloride reabsorption was 0.88 +/- 0.33, significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than that of patients with Bartter's syndrome. Normokalemic control subjects had a fractional distal chloride reabsorption of 0.86 +/- 0.01, higher than patients with Bartter's syndrome (p less than 0.001) but not significantly different from patients with hypokalemia. These results suggest that there is no effect of serum potassium concentration on fractional distal reabsorption of chloride in man. Hypokalemia of a moderate to severe degree is not accompanied by obligatory renal chloride loss except in Bartter's syndrome. Chloruresis is a specific feature of Bartter's syndrome rather than an effect of hypokalemia.\r"

In 8 hypotensive and 7 normotensive dialysis patients and in 7 control subjects, the pressor response to AII infusion was determined. Baseline values for AII, Aldo and AVP were the same in the different groups but with a much wider range in uremic patients. After standing for 5 min. both hypotensive and normotensive dialysis patients were able to maintain blood pressure without a significantly greater increase in heart rate than was seen in controls. Contrary to controls, however, all non-nephrectomized dialysis patients responded with an increase in AII and Aldo after standing for 5 min. In controls, exercise induced a clearcut increase in AII, Aldo and AVP, while no such changes were detectable in either hypotensive or normotensive dialysis patients. No significant differences in blood volumes were detectable between the groups. The pressor response to AII infusion was decreased in both normotensive and hypotensive dialysis patients compared with controls. It can be concluded that circulatory adjustment is abnormal in both hypotensive and normotensive dialysis patients as indicated by extremely high baseline levels of AII in some patients, abnormal response of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and AVP to postural change and exercise and a decreased pressor response to AII infusion. However, neither these abnormalities nor changes in blood volumes can directly account for the chronic hypotension seen in some dialysis patients.\r"

When RenNew-D was part of automated reprocessing performed with 4.3% bleach as specified by the manufacturer (Lixivitron), dialyzer survival was prolonged (16.7 +/- 7.2 uses) and hemodialysis neutropenia was unchanged with reuse. When RenNew-D was part of manual reprocessing conducted in the absence of bleach, marked improvement in dialyzer biocompatibility was observed but with a decreased survival (4.8 +/- 3.0). The majority of dialyzer failures were due to a fall in fiber bundle volume below a 85% set limit. Small solute clearances were maintained with both types of reprocessing. Dialyses were well tolerated throughout. Our data suggest that RenNew-D is a safe and efficacious product which can serve as a valuable alternative to formaldehyde for the purpose of dialyzer reuse.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of intraperitoneally administered clindamycin phosphate were studied in 9 volunteer subjects undergoing CAPD. Volunteers were assigned to 2 groups with the first group receiving clindamycin phosphate 300 mg/l in exchanges 1 through 5, and the second group receiving clindamycin phosphate 300 mg/l in exchange 1, and then 30 mg/l in exchanges 2 through 5. Clindamycin serum and dialysate effluent levels were determined by bioassay. When admixed with dialysate fluid and instilled into the peritoneal cavity, clindamycin phosphate is rapidly activated. Serum concentrations of clindamycin were rapidly achieved in both groups during the first exchange. Subjects in groups I and II had peak serum levels of active drug within 3 (3.94 ug/ml) and 5 (7.35 ug/ml) h, respectively. These results support the practice of not only administering intraperitoneal clindamycin phosphate to treat CAPD-related peritonitis, but using this route of administration to treat systemic infections due to susceptible bacteria in patients without intravenous access.\r"

All 14 patients were operated on to salvage failed cemented total hip arthroplasties. Allografts were employed only for large proximal femoral deficiencies. In these patients the alternatives were either an unstable excision arthroplasty or a femoral deficient prosthesis. After revision, all patients had complete bony union and ambulated with the assistance of a cane with greatly increased function and pain relief. There were no infection. Functionally, the patients have shown marked improvement. At this time there is no radiologic evidence of resorption of the graft. The use of bone allografts in this procedure has been encouraging to date; however, the follow-up period has been only 16-30 months. the success or failure of this procedure will be determined in time.\r"

Forty-seven normal shoulders were studied by computerized tomography (CT) in adduction, 20 additionally in forward flexion/internal rotation, which is the position most frequently causing subcoracoid impingement. The distance between the humeral head and the coracoid tip averaged 8.7 mm for the adducted arm and 6.8 mm for the flexed arm. Modifications of the coracohumeral relationship were found to affect the subcoracoid clearance roughly 1.5 times more in flexion than with arm at the side. Subcoracoid impingement appeared particularly likely during forward flexion of a shoulder with a coracoid tip close to the scapular neck and projecting far laterally.\r"

Hematoma and swelling at the mouth of the carpal tunnel are the likely cause in acute cases. A contributing factor generally not recognized initially is a volarly displaced fragment of distal radius compressing the median nerve against the proximal edge of the flexor retinaculum. In nine such fractures, median nerve compression occurred in eight. Lack of recognition led to the delay in diagnosis and treatment of two patients. The volar fragment could always be seen on the first postreduction roentgenogram. Carpal tunnel release and removal or reduction of the displaced volar fragment should be carried out as early as possible to avoid the complications of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Removal of the bony fragment alone, without carpal tunnel decompression, may be insufficient.\r"

Normal ranges for both devices were established for a control group of 48 normal subjects. With the UCLA device at 200 N of applied tibial force, 95% of normal knees have an anterior laxity less than 8.0 mm and a side to side difference less than 2.0 mm; corresponding values for the KT-1000 at 89 N are 9.0 mm and 2.0 mm. Both devices showed that anterior laxity of 19 anterior cruciate absent knees was approximately double that for normal knees. Measurements taken with these two testing instruments do not have a one-to-one correlation, as the method of femoral constraint and the amount of applied tibial force will influence the magnitude of the recorded laxities. Proper interpretation of laxities measured with each device requires consideration of right-left scatter in a normal population tested with that particular device. Both devices were 90%-95% accurate in correctly classifying an anterior cruciate absent knee outside the normal range.\r"

When the subjects stood on the wedged sole board, the line through the center of gravity and femorotibial angle did not change. The change in the spatial positions of the lower limb (p less than 0.02), i.e., the mechanical axis of the lower limb near an upright position, and the change of the calcaneus to valgus direction in the subtalar joint (p less than 0.01) were observed. These changes were considered from two-dimensional analysis to reduce the excessive loading on the medial joint surface and the excessive tensile force of the lateral side. The wedged insole thus proved effective for the conservative treatment of the medial compartment osteoarthritic knee.\r"

Electromyographic studies clearly demonstrated that the biceps femoris muscle acted as a major subluxor and the popliteus as a reducer. The operative findings of the patients were not different from those of the patients who could not subluxate voluntarily. The active muscle pull of the popliteus is a key to treatment of posterolateral instability.\r"

Follow-up examination (two to 12 years) was obtained in 25 patients. Based on clinical performance index, outcome was judged satisfactory in 17 patients (68%). Seventeen (68%) had an anatomic reduction, and 15 (88%) of these 17 had a satisfactory result. Compared to a group of 26 similar patients treated within 24 hours after injury, the major effect of delay was an adverse influence on the probability of achieving an anatomic reduction (p less than 0.08). When anatomic reduction was obtained, the performance index in the delayed-treatment group (78.8) was comparable to that in the immediate-treatment group (78.4%). Thus, when immediate fixation is not possible, delayed reduction and fixation of displaced ankle fractures is a reasonable option in some instances and can be seriously considered by the surgeon. Displaced fractures should not be left in a malreduced position because this provides virtually no opportunity for a satisfactory result.\r"

In two cases of streptococcal myositis with extensive muscle necrosis, both developed severe acute infection with septicaemia. Histologic observations revealed massive necrosis of muscle tissue with acute inflammatory infiltration. This condition, which we designate streptococcal necrotizing myositis should be treated as a separate disease entity. It requires not just incision and drainage, as in bacterial myositis, but radical excision of all the necrotic muscles in addition to appropriate antibiotics. Unless it is recognized, the treatment will be inadequate and un-necessarily prolonged. Intramuscular pressure may contribute to the pathogenesis of muscle necrosis and may stimulate compartmental syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with birth palsy can be expected to recover spontaneously. But in some patients the recovery is unsatisfactory and the functional results are disappointing. One possible way to improve the prognosis for such patients is early surgical nerve reconstruction. In six infants, exploration of the brachial plexus was carried out at about six months after delivery, when there were no signs of recovery in shoulder and elbow joint movements. Preoperative metrizamide myelography, computerized tomography with intrathecal metrizamide (CT myelography), and axon reflex test (histamine test) were followed by intraoperative electrophysiologic examinations of root sensory evoked potential (SEP), nerve action potential (NAP), and evoked muscle response (M-response). Microsurgical nerve repair was performed on the basis of intraoperative diagnosis. Metrizamide myelography showed 13% false-positive root avulsion. Reliability of the histamine test was 80%. The intraoperative electro-diagnosis is essential for understanding the actual condition of the brachial plexus lesion and obtaining better results from microsurgical reconstruction in birth palsy. The surgical results, with an average follow-up evaluation of two years and four months, have been encouraging enough to continue this diagnostic and therapeutic program, though its superiority to natural recovery has not yet been clarified.\r"

The intraarticular pressure was 75 mm Hg. In 17 patients with a normal patellofemoral joint, the lateral facet aligned at a mean knee flexion of 20 degrees, the patellar ridge at 35 degrees, and the medial facet at 50 degrees. Twelve patients with patellar subluxation showed no difference in the alignment of the lateral facet, but differed significantly with regard to alignment of both the ridge and the medial facet with contact at a mean flexion of 55 degrees and 85 degrees, respectively. The median measurements in 20 patients with idiopathic anterior knee pain did not deviate significantly from the normal material. However, the dispersion was increased significantly, with eight patients having increased measurements consistent with malalignment and three having decreased measurements below the lower limit of normal alignment. Patients with idiopathic anterior knee pain apparently can be reclassified according to the arthroscopically determined alignment, which may prove important in the treatment of these patients.\r"

When the infrapatellar fat pad was completely removed following extensive medial arthrotomy, the blood flow further decreased to an average of 49% of the control. When a lateral retinacular release with sacrifice of the lateral superior genicular artery was performed following the medial arthrotomy, the blood flow decreased to an average of 53% of the control. When a lateral release was combined with removal of the fat pad following the main medial arthrotomy, the patellar blood flow showed marked decrease to an average of only 17% of the control. The vascular anatomic study demonstrated that many vessels penetrate from the fat pad into the inferior pole of the patella. It is suggested that the lateral superior genicular artery and/or the fat pad should be carefully preserved to avoid ischemia of the patella during extensive procedures such as total knee arthroplasty.\r"

While loss of trabecular volume was common to both sexes, the histologic basis for the loss differed. Decreased formation (expressed primarily as static indices) seemed to be the principal factor in bone loss in men; in women these features remained unchanged, suggesting that increased resorption was the principal factor. Bone loss in women was principally attributable to the total removal of individual trabeculae; conversely in men, there was generalized attenuation of trabecular bone. Similar findings in bone tissues of vertebral bodies suggest that differences in bone remodelling between the sexes produce different patterns of bone loss as a sequence of aging.\r"

The influence of cement injection pressure, type of cement, ambient temperature, chilling of the monomer, and centrifugation of cement-on-cement intrusion depth was investigated in specimens of bovine cancellous bone. In order to validate the bovine model for comparative purposes relative to use in man, a linear relationship between human and bovine cancellous bone was first demonstrated for various porosities and cement intrusion depth. Three cements (Low Viscosity Cement [LVC], Simplex-P, and Palacos) were intruded at three different pressures (20, 40, and 60 PSI) at the same ambient temperature and relative humidity into commercially prepared plugs of bovine cancellous bone. Cement intrusion depth was proportional to injection pressure for all three cements, but was significantly different for each cement at a given pressure. At 20, 40, and 60 PSI, Palacos had a cement intrusion depth of 1.4, 2.4, and 2.8 mm respectively, while the figures for Simplex-P were 2.2, 4.2, and 5.0 mm, and for LVC were 8.0, 12.0, and 14.6 mm. Ambient temperature had an inverse relationship with cement intrusion depth for all three cements given the same experimental conditions. Chilling the monomer increased the intrusion of Simplex-P to 5.8, 8.2, and 12.7 mm at 20, 40, and 60 PSI injection pressure respectively. Simplex-P intrusion depth was not modified by cement centrifugation at any of the three injection pressures tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Through an endoscope the laser was observed to soften and ablate the methyl methacrylate. The vapors generated by this process were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The two chief components were hydrogen and carbon monoxide, followed by carbon dioxide, methane, acetylene, and C3 unsaturated hydrocarbons. A high capacity smoke evacuator must be used in conjunction with laser vaporization of methylmethacrylate. The method should be evaluated under in vivo conditions in dogs before it is attempted in patients.\r"

It was found to produce acetabular dysplasia. The acetabulum gradually became shallower and more vertically oriented, and the femoral head gradually subluxed but never dislocated. The radiographic appearance of the hip dysplasia was similar to that seen in humans. Histologically, a substantial degenerative change in articular cartilage was observed in the subluxed hip, without any evidence of degenerative arthritis radiologically. When operating on congenital dislocation of the hip, a complete excision or eversion of the acetabular labrum should be avoided. Radial splitting of the acetabular labrum may safely avoid the risk of violating the acetabular epiphyseal cartilage.\r"

These results indicate that manipulation of the spine can be effective treatment for lumbar disc protrusions. In general, the manipulation consists of eight maneuvers in three positions. The selection of the appropriate maneuvers depends on the patient's symptoms and signs and on the judgment and expertise of the operator. Practice is necessary to become proficient in spinal manipulation techniques. Several mechanisms of regression lumbar disc protrusions are possible.\r"

The fractures are classified as follows: fracture of both radius and ulna, 1161 cases (52.3%); fracture of the ulna alone, 343 (15.4%); Monteggia fracture, 259 (11.7%); fracture of the radius alone, 222 (10%); and Galeazzi fracture, 236 (10.6%). For each type, the treatment consisted of closed reduction by manipulation, immobilization, and functional exercises. A total of 1054 cases of forearm fracture were followed for 0.5-6.5 years (average, 2.5 years). The results were excellent in 735 cases (69.7%); good, 153 (14.5%); fair, 79 (7.5%); and poor, 87 (8.3%). The time of bone union was from 21-258 days. Nonunion occurred in three cases. Anatomic observations were carried out in specimens of adult forearms, which showed that: the interosseous membrane is an important factor in maintaining the stability of the radius and ulna and is the anatomic basis for manipulative reduction by bone separation; the use of bone separator pads can maintain the normal tension of the interosseous membrane and the physiologic space between the radius and ulna. Stress analysis of the bone separator pads and splint immobilization suggests that treatment of forearm fracture by integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine is simple, economical, relatively painless, and effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cruciate ligaments maintain not only the anteroposterior stability, but also rotational and one-plane medial or lateral stability together with the medial and lateral structures. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays a part in maintaining anterior one-plane stability and rotational stability of the knee, while the posterior cruciate ligament plays a major part in maintaining both posterior one-plane stability and rotational stability of the knee. An isolated medial (or lateral) ligament (ML) tear can only result in medial or lateral one-plane instability and an increased rotation, but no shift of the axis of rotation occurs. It is not a genuine rotational instability. Both ACL and ML tears are present in one-plane medial, one-plane anterior, and anteromedial rotational instability, but the anterior drawer test or abduction stress test may be negative if the tear of the ACL or ML is partial.\r"

According to the management of the wounds, patients were divided into three groups: wound healing by secondary intention in cases where skin closure was impossible; primary closure of wound with or without pedicle muscle transfer in cases of a small debrided cavity or in cases where a nearby skeletal muscle is available; and closed irrigation and suction drainage of the wound cavity. After a long-term follow-up period, satisfactory results to varying degrees were obtained in each group. Closed intermittent irrigation and suction drainage with high concentrations of antibiotic solutions gave the best results. In instances of failure, the causes may be due to inadequate removal of infected sclerotic bone and sequestra, obstruction of drainage tubes, resistance to antibiotics, or inadequate systemic antibiotic treatment. The use of myocutaneous flap transference to close the postoperative wound of chronic osteomyelitis was introduced, and preliminary results are encouraging.\r"

The anterior cortex of each vertebral body was thicker than the posterior cortex. The thickness of the anterior cortex of the dorsolumbar vertebral bodies progressively increases from the proximal to caudal vertebra. The lower lumbar vertebrae are therefore almost twice as thick as the upper dorsal vertebrae. The cortices of the vertebral bodies, especially the anterior cortex, serve as a strut against the pressure of the prosthesis. Four types of prostheses were used. The Type 1 prosthesis failed to take into account the anatomic features of the dorsolumbar vertebral bodies in cross section. Types 2, 3, and 4 are modified versions with specific indications for their use.\r"

Features included repeated regurgitation or rumination (99%), signs suggesting esophageal pain (49%, excessive crying \"colic,\" sleep disturbance, Sutcliffe-Sandifer syndrome, respiratory symptoms 42%), failure to thrive (18%), and minor hematemesis (18%). Feeding problems and maternal distress were common, associated with child abuse in four cases. Therapy was initially conservative (posture, thickening of feeds, antacids, bethanechol), augmented by cimetidine in those with proven esophagitis (n = 34, 0.27%). Most (81%) were symptom-free by 18 months of age (55% by 10 months of age); 17 percent had fundoplication with good results; 2 percent have persisting symptoms beyond 2 years of age (1% failed surgery). No deaths were recorded. Surgery was performed for recurrent apneas/aspiration (6%), refractory esophagitis or stricture (5%), and failed medical management (7%). Esophagitis was a significant determinant to outcome, and the importance of selective early endoscopy is emphasized. GER is a cause of considerable morbidity in infants but, with active therapy, is self-limiting in the majority. Certain distinctive clinical signs indicate those patients who require detailed investigation and to whom more aggressive therapeutic efforts should be directed.\r"

The most important factors in appropriate intervention are a physician's receptivity and sensitivity toward the stressed mother, together with an interested and practical approach to providing adequate support while delineating the individual stresses acting on both mother and baby. Future research is needed to delineate markers for those subgroups of infants who may present with crying as a manifestation of specific clinical situations.\r"

Our experience suggests that variability in sweat electrolyte concentrations may occur more commonly than is generally appreciated.

The serum AUCs from 6 to 30 hours after Theo-24 ingestion during the water, charcoal, and charcoal plus sorbitol phases were 305 +/- 16, 113 +/- 6, and 85 +/- 10 mg-hr/L (mean +/- SE), respectively. We conclude that the addition of sorbitol to an oral regimen of multiple doses of activated charcoal decreased the serum theophylline concentrations after therapeutic doses of slow-release theophylline to a significantly greater extent than did the activated charcoal regimen alone.\r"

In a crossover study, eight healthy subjects (four men and four women) received an enteric-coated aspirin (648 mg) together with a Heidelberg capsule while fasting or with food (breakfast, followed 4 hours later by lunch). Salicylic acid and salicyluric acid concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by HPLC. The mean (+/- SD) GRT was significantly delayed by food (0.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.9 +/- 3.3 hours; P less than 0.005). The mean (+/- SD) lag time (TL) and time to peak concentration (expressed as salicylic acid equivalents) were markedly prolonged after the fed regimen (2.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 8.9 +/- 3.7 hours [P less than 0.005] and 8.3 +/- 2.9 vs. 13.8 +/- 4.5 hours [P less than 0.025]). For the combined data from the fasting and fed evaluations, an excellent correlation existed between TL and GRT of the capsule (TL = 1.0 GRT + 1.95; n = 16; r = 0.94; P less than 0.0001). Women demonstrated greater delays in GRT and TL than did men. The delay in aspirin absorption from an enteric-coated tablet is directly related to its GRT, which is gender related and greatly affected by food.\r"

Our dosing schedule began with 30 mg in the first subject and ended with 100 mg and 150 mg in the final four subjects. We measured blood esmolol concentration, PR interval, QRS duration, QTc interval, cardiac cycle, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Esmolol doses of 150 mg produced blood esmolol concentrations of 0.868 to 1.47 micrograms/ml. The peak PR interval recorded after esmolol was significantly longer than the control PR interval in four subjects who received 100 and 150 mg doses (192 +/- 7.9 msec vs. 177 +/- 10.6 msec; P = 0.00002). Peak prolongation of the PR interval was recorded 6 to 10 minutes after the bolus, at which time blood esmolol concentrations were negligible. Esmolol did not consistently affect any other pharmacodynamic variable. Giving esmolol as an intravenous bolus injection may be a simple alternative to loading and maintenance infusion in some clinical settings.\r"

No patient who failed to respond to a lower dose responded to 200 mg daily. The frequency of ventricular tachycardia was reduced by at least 75% in eight of 17 patients receiving 50 mg daily, seven of 16 patients receiving 100 mg daily, and eight of 11 receiving 200 mg daily (P = not significant for any paired dose comparison).

Nifedipine was given intravenously according to two regimens, each designed to produce the same steady-state concentration, but attained gradually (within 5 to 7 hours) with one regimen and rapidly (within 3 minutes) with the other. The mean steady-state concentrations obtained were 31.7 +/- 5.2 (SD) ng/ml and 29.4 +/- 9.8 ng/ml, respectively (not significant). With the gradual regimen, heart rate was unchanged and diastolic blood pressure was lowered gradually by approximately 10 mm Hg. With the rapid regimen, heart rate increased immediately and remained elevated for the duration of the infusion, whereas diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly. At the end of the gradual-rise regimen, the infusion rate was increased tenfold for 10 minutes, promptly resulting in tachycardia and a paradoxical rise in diastolic blood pressure. These divergent hemodynamic responses of the gradual- and rapid-rise regimens could well be related to differences in baroreceptor activation. It is concluded that the hemodynamic response to nifedipine is influenced by the rate of increase of its concentration in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the vasodilatory action of carvedilol (BM 14190), a new antihypertensive agent, was investigated in normal volunteers. Intra-arterial blood pressure and ECG were monitored continuously. Carvedilol (1 mg/min for 15 minutes) produced a rapid reduction in blood pressure and a transient increase in heart rate. At the end of infusion, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 23% (-32.3 mm Hg) and 18% (-13.6 mm Hg), respectively, whereas heart rate was not different from baseline. At the doses used, the hypotensive effect of carvedilol was greater than that of labetalol (36 and 72 mg in 15 minutes). Carvedilol and labetalol antagonized isoproterenol-induced hypotension and tachycardia, at serum levels greater than or equal to 8 and 20 mg/ml, respectively. Both drugs antagonized phenylephrine pressor effects. A similar degree of inhibition (25% of control) of pressor effects was observed for carvedilol and labetalol when their respective serum concentrations were 23 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml. Neither carvedilol nor labetalol had any effect on AII pressor responses. Carvedilol serum levels as high as 150 ng/ml failed to inhibit AII-induced pressor responses. Our results suggest that at the doses used in this study, carvedilol has both alpha 1-and nonselective beta-receptor blocking properties. Moreover, carvedilol is approximately three to five times more potent than labetalol in blocking alpha 1-and beta-receptors and in reducing blood pressure.\r"

Nitrendipine (mean dose 32 mg/day) and acebutolol (414 mg/day) were administered in monotherapy in increasing dosage and mefruside was added in patients not controlled by monotherapy. The recumbent and standing blood pressures were reduced (P less than 0.01 or less) during monotherapy with nitrendipine and acebutolol, but the magnitude of blood pressure reduction was greater (P less than 0.05 or less) during nitrendipine dosing. Pulse rate decreased (P less than 0.01) during acebutolol whereas nitrendipine induced a nonsignificant increase. Both treatments induced no changes in serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, uric acid, lipids, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary aldosterone. The overall incidence of side effects was similar with both treatments but four patients discontinued nitrendipine because of headache. The addition of mefruside to nitrendipine or acebutolol produced a further fall of blood pressure in patients not controlled with monotherapy. Monotherapy with nitrendipine or acebutolol offers an effective, safe first-line antihypertensive treatment in blacks entered in this study; with the described dosages and therapeutic schedule, nitrendipine was somewhat more effective than acebutolol.\r"

There were no differences between control and propranolol treatment conditions in ketanserin volume of distribution (5.2 vs. 3.8 L/kg), elimination half-life (6.6 vs. 4.7 hours), clearance (9.7 vs. 10.0 ml/min/kg), or 72-hour excretion of intact ketanserin (0.7% vs. 0.7% of dose) or ketanserinol (21.8% vs. 24.9% of dose). In a second study, eight volunteers received a 160 mg oral dose of propranolol hydrochloride in the control state and again during treatment with ketanserin, 40 mg b.i.d. There were no significant differences between control and ketanserin conditions in the time of peak serum propranolol concentration (2.1 vs. 1.5 hours after dosage) or elimination half-life (3.8 vs. 4.1 hours). However, ketanserin increased peak serum propranolol concentrations (169 vs. 233 ng/ml) and reduced oral clearance (39 vs. 27 ml/min/kg); the differences were not statistically significant (0.05 less than P less than 0.1) with a sample size of eight. Thus therapeutic doses of propranolol in healthy volunteers do not alter the kinetics of a single dose of ketanserin. Therapeutic doses of ketanserin may impair oral clearance of propranolol, leading to increased area under the serum concentration curve and higher peak serum levels.\r"

After steady state was achieved (2 weeks), the infusion clearance was 646 +/- 221 ml/min/m2. Interpatient differences in serum albumin levels were correlated with both the bolus clearance (r = 0.49) and the initial (first month) infusion clearance (r = 0.39). The infusion clearance decreased over the duration of the infusion (726 vs. 489 ml/min/m2; P = 0.001;months 1 vs. 4). Analysis of intrapatient changes in vinblastine clearance demonstrated a positive correlation with albumin (P less than 0.01) and negative correlation with dose (P less than 0.05). These results are consistent with a nonlinear pharmacokinetic model. We conclude that interpatient and intrapatient differences in vinblastine pharmacokinetics can be attributed partially to changes in hepatic function and nonlinear elimination at higher doses.\r"

To assess more fully the implications of this observation, we examined the effect of verapamil on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of quinidine.

The half-life of quinidine was also significantly prolonged by verapamil. The formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine was reduced by 61.2% and 70.6% after verapamil pretreatment (80 and 120 mg, respectively) (P less than 0.01), whereas the renal clearance of unchanged quinidine was not affected. These results indicate that verapamil impairs the metabolism of quinidine to 3-hydroxyquinidine and reduces the oral clearance of quinidine to a degree that could be of clinical significance given the narrow therapeutic index of this drug.\r"

Delapril produced significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity 24 hours after dosing.

  ".W": "Intravenous doses (100 mg in 20 minutes) of the antidepressant drug nomifensine, administered to male volunteers, increased heart rate and blood pressure, elevated the plasma levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and powerfully stimulated growth hormone release and inhibited the secretion of prolactin. Oral nomifensine, either as a single 100 mg dose or as a similar dose after 2 weeks' treatment with the drug (150 mg/day), caused none of the above effects. This was in line with the limited (less than 30%) oral bioavailability of the active, unconjugated form of the drug, estimated in the same subjects. MHPG in plasma was slightly but consistently reduced by the 2 weeks' treatment, suggesting reduced turnover of norepinephrine. The observed clinical effects of nomifensine are compatible with uptake inhibition and augmented release of norepinephrine and dopamine and possibly direct agonistic effects on dopamine receptors. Although nomifensine was withdrawn from the market because of immunologic complications, it serves as a model compound of a new pharmacologic class of antidepressants, devoid of many of the disturbing side effects of the tricyclic drugs.\r"

An NT dose of 50 mg (but not 25 mg) clearly reduced saliva flow (P less than 0.05) and was therefore used for comparison with the major and active metabolite of NT, E-10-hydroxynortriptyline (E-10-OH-NT). Equimolar doses of both compounds (and placebo) were randomly given to eight healthy male subjects in another double-blind, crossover study aimed to assess the reduction of saliva flow. NT significantly depressed saliva flow compared with both placebo (P less than 0.01) and E-10-OH-NT (P less than 0.05). By contrast, there was no difference between E-10-OH-NT and placebo. This study confirms previous indications that the anticholinergic effect of E-10-OH-NT is considerably less than that of the parent drug NT.\r"

ALA was undetectable in 35 of 53 samples of normal cerebrospinal fluid (limit of assay 2 nmol/l). The mean of the other 18 samples was 19 nmol/l (SD = 10, range 6-36 nmol/l). Salivary ALA was generally only 10-30% of the plasma level in normal and porphyric subjects. Erythrocytes of normal and porphyric subjects contained no detectable ALA and were impermeable to its entry. ALA clearance correlated closely with that of creatinine, consistent with it being excreted by glomerular filtration with limited tubular reabsorption. In chronic renal failure, serum ALA was elevated to a maximum of three to four times the normal, but its urinary excretion was reduced, in keeping with lessened production. In two cases of acute intermittent porphyria with overwhelming neuropathy the maximum plasma levels of ALA were 9 and 12 mumol/l. Haematin infusion decreased the ALA levels but without obvious clinical benefit. Limited neurological recovery occurred without major reduction in plasma levels of ALA. One subject's attack was precipitated by pregnancy. The neonate was apparently normal, despite high levels of ALA in maternal plasma throughout gestation and a high level of ALA in the cord blood. The observations described here do not support the view that ALA may be directly neurotoxic.\r"

Increasing the albumin concentration in the medium resulted in an increase in the Km, without effect on the Vmax.. When taurocholate and albumin were kept constant (20:1 molar ratio), the Vmax. was significantly lower than in the other experiments. These data suggest that taurocholate uptake shows saturation in the absence of albumin and that albumin reduces taurocholate uptake.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute ethanol administration on blood pressure, heart rate and the baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate were studied in normotensive subjects who served as their own control. Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was measured by two methods: the ramp method and the steady state method. None of the doses of ethanol had any effect on blood pressure during the observation period, except for the highest dose where a slight elevation was evident for a short period of time. On the other hand, the heart rate showed a slight but consistent dose-related increase. In general, ethanol attenuated the baroreceptor mediated bradycardia but this effect was dependent on the way in which blood pressure was elevated. A dose-related impairment of baroreceptors was evident when the ramp method was used, i.e. ethanol significantly depressed baroreflex sensitivity, expressed as delta heart period (HP)/delta mean arterial pressure (MAP). In contrast, delta HP/delta MAP was not influenced by ethanol when the steady state method was used. However, the steady state baroreflex curves were reset about a higher median blood pressure (MAP50), suggesting that the baroreceptors will be operative at higher blood pressure levels after ethanol. The pressor responsiveness was also influenced differently by ethanol depending on the method of injecting phenylephrine. An increase in pressor responsiveness was evident, though not dose-related, after ethanol only when blood pressure was elevated by the ramp method, suggesting that the inverse relationship between baroreflex sensitivity and pressor responsiveness is more prominent with the ramp method and/or when impairment rather than resetting of baroreceptors occurs. That the decrease in baroreflex sensitivity and the increase in MAP50 were related to peak ethanol levels in blood and that the blood pressure was not influenced by ethanol strongly suggest these effects were ethanol mediated. The weakened buffering action of the baroreflexes would be expected to favour the development of higher blood pressure.\r"

Blood flow was measured by the local 133Xe-xenon washout technique in a vascular bed locally paralysed by the injection of histamine. Blood flow was measured before, during and after a 40 mmHg increase of the vascular transmural pressure, induced by head-up tilt. The mean increase in blood flow during head-up tilt was only 24% in diabetic subjects with and 48% in diabetic patients without clinical microangiopathy, compared with 79% in normal non-diabetic subjects (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.05, respectively). An inverse correlation between microvascular distensibility and degree of hyalinosis of the terminal arterioles in biopsies from the skin was demonstrated (r = - 0.57, P less than 0.001). Our results suggest that terminal arteriolar hyalinosis reduces the microvascular distensibility and probably increases the minimal vascular resistance, thereby impeding hyperaemic responses.\r"

In vivo, blood pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and plasma cyclic AMP responses to isoprenaline (0.01, 0.02 and 0.05 microgram min-1 kg-1 intravenously) were related to the plasma concentrations of isoprenaline. for comparison, beta 2-adrenoceptor function was evaluated in lymphocytes in vitro by studies of isoprenaline-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP and radioligand binding studies using 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. In vivo, the beta 2-mediated plasma cyclic AMP response to isoprenaline was markedly attenuated during terbutaline treatment and was still reduced by 38% (P less than 0.05) 72 h after discontinuation of treatment. The blood pressure and heart rate responses to isoprenaline were unaffected by treatment. Isoprenaline-induced elevations of plasma noradrenaline concentrations were markedly reduced during terbutaline treatment. This indicates an attenuation of isoprenaline-induced increases in sympathetic nerve function and could explain why no attenuation of the isoprenaline-induced vasodilatation was observed. Thus, plasma cyclic AMP seems to be a better marker than diastolic blood pressure when evaluating beta 2-adrenoceptor responsiveness in vivo in man, since it is not influenced by counter-regulatory increases in sympathetic nerve activity and/or noradrenaline overflow from sympathetic nerves. In lymphocytes, the isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was reduced by 75% and the beta-adrenoceptor binding sites were reduced by 40% 12 h after dosing. Also the lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors recovered slowly after withdrawal of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of the use of abdominal and expiratory muscles during cough, the cardioacceleratory response was compared with that induced by an intense contraction of the arm muscles (handgrip). The cardioacceleratory response was completely abolished by atropine while propranolol failed to affect it. The diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy showed a response similar to that after cholinergic blockade. The response was similar to that induced by muscular contraction for 4 s, after which it differed showing a continued cardioacceleration. The patterns of recovery were not different. The cough-induced cardioacceleration is essentially reflex in nature and under cholinergic control; initially the mechanism may be partially related to the intense contraction of abdominal and expiratory muscles; later, the arterial hypotension related to the cough may contribute to the more sustained shortening of the R-R interval. The cough test may be useful for the evaluation of cardiac parasympathetic integrity.\r"

This contrasts to adaptation in acute respiratory acidosis, where levels similar to those attained in chronic acidosis occur within hours. Accordingly, the inability to discern marked changes in acute metabolic acidosis compared with acute respiratory acidosis has been attributed to decreased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow seen frequently in the former. In our studies, we found early changes in ammoniagenesis and glutamine metabolism during acute metabolic acidosis, but not of the magnitude seen in chronic acidosis, even considering the changes in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Exogenous glutamine loading allowed us to discover that the qualitative changes in glutamine metabolism during acute metabolic acidosis differed from control but fell short of those seen in chronic metabolic a acidosis. We also examined glutamine metabolism when renal ammoniagenic adaptation was acutely inhibited in chronically acidotic dogs. Infusing NaHCO3 into chronically acidotic dogs decreased renal ammonia production significantly (247 mumol min-1 100 ml-1 GFR vs 148 mumol min-1 100 ml-1 GFR: P less than 0.001) and glutamine extraction (111.8 mumol min-1 100 ml-1 GFR vs 90.9 mumol min-1 100 ml-1 GFR: P less than 0.02). The qualitative changes in renal glutamine metabolism in both studies suggest that alterations in deamination of glutamate formed from glutamine are responsible, at least in part, for adaptation to acute acid-base perturbations. Compared with respiratory acidosis, adaptation to metabolic acidosis is progressive and prolonged.\r"

Incubation for periods of up to 7 days with fetal calf serum and human serum produced increases in both specific [3H]ouabain binding and ouabain sensitive 86rubidium influx that were dependent on concentration and time. Neither specific [3H]ouabain binding nor ouabain sensitive 86rubidium influx was altered when dialysed serum was used, suggesting that both fetal calf serum and human serum contain a dialysable factor or factors which stimulate specific [3H]ouabain binding and ouabain sensitive 86rubidium influx in intact human lymphocytes. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these changes we also measured the activity of two other enzymes of the lymphocyte plasma membrane, 5'-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyltransferase, the uptake of [3H]thymidine by the intact cells, and the effects of cycloheximide, puromycin, and anisomycin, inhibitors of protein synthesis. The activity of 5'-nucleotidase was increased after incubation of the lymphocytes in fetal calf serum for 72 h, but the activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase was not changed, suggesting some selectivity of the stimulatory effect. Measurements of [3H]thymidine uptake by the lymphocytes showed that the major part of the observed changes in specific [3H]ouabain binding and ouabain sensitive 86rubidium influx was not attributable to transformation of the lymphocytes to lymphoblasts. All three inhibitors of protein synthesis prevented the increase in specific [3H]ouabain binding due to fetal calf serum.\r"

  ".W": "Lithium was investigated for its possible use as a marker for identifying the various sources of NaCl in the diet. Micromolar concentrations of lithium can be detected in various vegetables, tap water and also in urine specimens of adult volunteers. The lithium content of vegetables varied from 6.1 to 24.5 mumol of lithium/kg dry weight, with the exception of spinach and aubergines which had much higher concentrations. The excretion of the element in 24 h urine specimens ranged from 2 to 4 mumol of lithium/day. Experiments were performed to assess whether both lithium and sodium would penetrate foods at the same rate during cooking. The rates of penetration into food for both elements were proportional to their concentration in the cooking water despite a sodium/lithium ratio of 50:1. Physiological experiments were conducted to investigate the handling of small doses of lithium by the body. A dose of 250 mumol of lithium was chosen as optimal and given orally to healthy volunteers in either single or continuous aqueous doses of lithium carbonate. The recoveries of oral lithium in urine were 92 +/- 5% (SD) and 97 +/- 4 (SD) (n = 5) for single and continuous doses respectively. The daily addition of 100 mmol of oral NaCl to the diet of volunteers receiving a standard dose of lithium did not affect urinary lithium excretion rates nor the final recovery of the administered lithium. These studies suggest that lithium carbonate may be a useful marker for the uptake of NaCl into cooked food; after eating lithium-enriched food the monitoring of urinary lithium output may then be used to quantify the amount of sodium derived from the specific foods.\r"

To validate the use of this tagged salt, which replaced alternately table salt and cooking salt in daily use, a 44 day metabolic study was conducted on five volunteers. Measurements of sodium and lithium balance throughout the study showed that 93% of both dietary sodium and dietary lithium were excreted in the urine and 1.7% of dietary lithium and 2% of dietary sodium in the faeces. Collections of sweat for 48 h at intervals throughout the study showed that only 1.7% of dietary lithium and 1.4% of dietary sodium were recovered in sweat. Thus both elements were excreted equivalently by the three main routes. The apparent mean sodium retention over the whole period of dietary control was 7.4 +/- 4.4 mmol/day or 3.4% of the total intake. The excretory patterns of lithium after a period of lithium ingestion were exponential, thus allowing a method to be developed for the prediction of total lithium output from a shorter period of urine collection. This study suggests that the lithium method is suitable for epidemiological use to measure the sources of dietary salt.\r"

Men and women aged 20-60 participated in a 12 day study with sequential 24 h urine collections to assess salt sources over a 7 day period. Total salt consumption estimated from urinary chloride excretion amounted to 10.6 +/- 0.55 (SEM) g in 33 men and 7.4 +/- 0.29 (SEM) g in 50 women. The cooking salt eaten was only 0.45 +/- 0.09 (SEM) g in men and women, with men eating more table salt (0.77 g/day) than women (0.46 g/day). Discretionary sources, i.e. cooking and table salt use, contributed only 15% to the total intake. Salt from manufacturing foods and catering in purchased food therefore provided on average 85% of total salt intake. These results are consistent even when an allowance is made for the slightly poorer pouring quality of the lithium-tagged salt. The importance of food as a source of salt was reflected in the significant relationship between the weight of the individual and the amount of salt eaten (for males P less than 0.05 and for females P less than 0.001). Cooking salt consumption did not relate to the amount of salt derived from purchased food nor did table salt use relate to the amount of salt in cooked foods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It demands nutritional care to minimize the multiple complications of malnutrition. Nutritional support today is aimed at a daily administration of calories between 1.37 and 1.7 times the basal metabolic rate with 20% or more of these calories as protein. Fat emulsions are used twice weekly to replace essential fatty acids. Vitamins, minerals, and trace metals are supplied regularly. Current recommendations can be made based on a decade of experience, but they are changing rapidly with increased knowledge of the metabolic abnormalities occurring in the burn patients and on experience with a decade of nutritional replacement.\r"

However, recent studies suggest that weights up to 20% above ideal body weight do not carry a significant risk of increased mortality in the absence of other chronic diseases. A team approach helps maintain patient motivation, the key to an effective weight-loss program. An efficient weight-loss and weight-maintenance program in the moderately obese patient includes modification of eating patterns, an individualized balanced fuel-source diet, and an exercise program to allow caloric deficit of approximately 500 calories a day. We must realize that for morbidly obese patients in whom the amount of caloric restriction necessary to reach and maintain a desirable body weight may be incompatible with a reasonable quality of life, surgery is warranted. The aggressiveness of our therapeutic regimen should always depend on the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with the patient's degree of obesity.\r"

It elicited positive reactions in guinea pigs sensitized to Sudan I. It was also shown to be allergenic. The results suggest that para-hydroxylation of the phenyl group of Sudan I may play an important role in its allergenicity.\r"

Repeated open application tests (ROAT) with creams containing 7-15 ppm of the isothiazolinones were positive in 12 of 24 patients tested. 2 of the ROAT-positive cases had negative patch tests to 100 ppm Kathon CG, but 1 was positive with 200 ppm. Atopic dermatitis, chronic hand dermatitis and lower leg dermatitis were the most common disorders in the positive patients. The cause of the rapid increase of Kathon CG allergy in Finland during the winter of 1985-1986 was the use of a popular moisturizing cream containing first 19 ppm, then 7 ppm of a mixture of 2 isothiazolinones (Euxyl K 100).\r"

There was a statistically significant association between anergy in skin testing and lethal outcome of the current illness. Catheter cultures from 11 patients yielded over 15 colony-forming units of bacteria. No association was found between positive catheter cultures and skin reactivity to any of the antigens. This indicates that catheter colonization is independent of host factors reflected by skin testing and supports the view that transmission of microorganisms into catheters is more important than poor host defense in the initiation of catheter-related infections.\r"

We also attempted to resuscitate the dogs after a simulated wet drowning in each of the solutions, with and without chlorine. A control study with similar degree of anoxia but no fluid in the lungs was also performed. For the pulmonary variables of alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference, intrapulmonary shunt fraction, and PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen, the 0.225% NaCl solution was significantly (p less than .001) less injurious to the lungs, especially compared with sterile water. The 0.225% and 0.45% NaCl solutions were the least disruptive to pulmonary function; the pulmonary injury they produced was similar to injury in the control dogs. Chlorine in the solution at one to two parts per million did not influence the data. The 0.9% (isotonic, normal saline), 2%, and 3% NaCl drowning solutions showed little difference from one another in terms of pulmonary injury. They were significantly (p less than .05) better than sterile water and significantly (p less than .05) worse than the 0.225% and 0.45% NaCl solutions. Sterile water, whether chlorinated or not, was the most injurious to the lungs. The hemodynamic effects of the drowning solutions were explainable solely by the effects of anoxia.\r"

During norepinephrine infusion, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index increased (p less than .001) and heart rate decreased (p less than .02). Cardiac index either increased or was unchanged in ten patients and decreased slightly in the remaining two patients. Urine flow increased (p less than .01) and was more than 0.5 ml/min when a critical renal perfusion pressure was reached if renal damage was not overwhelming. We conclude that norepinephrine may improve arterial BP and urine flow when volume replacement and dopamine therapy have failed to reverse the hypotension of septic shock.\r"

All nurses (n = 15) caring for these patients were asked a parallel, hypothetical question about the usefulness of intensive care to these patients and to themselves, were they to become sick. Analysis of matched pairs of patient (or family member) and nurse questionnaires (n = 38) revealed that: nurses underestimate the usefulness of intensive care as evaluated by their patients and families; and patients believe that quality of life is a less important factor in judging the usefulness of intensive care than do their nurses.\r"

Using this new method improved the reproducibility of thermal determinations of RVEF. Although the thermal values were lower, the correlations between thermal and nuclear measurements were close [r = .92 (first-pass technique), r = .81 (gated technique)]. This new method seems particularly appropriate for serial monitoring of RV performance.\r"

Fluidized beds provide a medium that is more dense than water for patients to float on by pumping air through silicone-coated microspheres separated from the patient by a monofilament polyester sheet. A continuous stream of warm air flowing across the patient increases insensible evaporative water loss and may lead to dehydration. The air-fluidized bed has a wide range of operating temperatures (82 degrees to 102 degrees F), but surprisingly few data are available on the amount of water loss at different bed temperatures. This lack of information is probably secondary to difficulties in obtaining accurate fluid balance measurements in patients. Our objective was to construct a nomogram of insensible water loss for the fluidized bed using healthy volunteers under controlled conditions. We then prospectively compared this nomogram to data obtained from hospitalized patients.\r"

Rats were anesthetized and divided randomly into pentoxifylline (injected with pentoxifylline) and control (injected with normal saline) groups. Thirty minutes later, midline laparotomy was performed, and surface oxygen tensions and surface temperatures were measured on stomach, liver, cecum, urinary bladder, and anterior abdominal wall. Simultaneously, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and core temperature were measured. PaO2 was then measured. In the pentoxifylline-treated rats, tissue oxygen tensions were significantly higher than in saline-treated rats. Statistically, there was no significant difference in MAP during these measurements, no difference in either core or organ surface temperatures, and no significant difference in PaO2.\r"

The mucus was separated by a nonpermeable membrane from the ventilator's gas stream. Maximal, minimal, and mean viscosity were determined by a modified capillary viscosimeter. Under high-frequency vibrations, maximal, minimal, and mean viscosity slightly increased (p less than or equal to .001). Conversely, the mean viscosity of control samples did not change significantly. These findings indicate that high-frequency vibrations do not improve mucous rheology. Observed beneficial effects of HFV on mucociliary clearance may be caused by changes in the mucous subphase during HFV.\r"

Three increasing doses of diltiazem (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/kg of body weight) were injected into each patient, followed each time by an infusion (2 micrograms/kg/min, 3 micrograms/kg/min, and 4 micrograms/kg/min). The effects of the drug were also compared with those of oxygen, and the combined effect of high oxygen and diltiazem was tested. The mean plasma concentrations of diltiazem were, successively, 64 +/- 4, 158 +/- 19, and 267 +/- 40 ng/ml with the three increasing doses. There was no significant effect of diltiazem on the pulmonary vascular resistance even when given with oxygen. Diltiazem was well tolerated even at high doses. The arterial oxygen pressure, systemic oxygen supply, and oxygen consumption were unchanged. We conclude that diltiazem does not seem to decrease acutely hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in patients with chronic hypoxia; however, diltiazem may be given safely to these patients for other indications, such as angina pectoris.\r"

To investigate the possible relationship between tuberculosis and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), we reviewed case records at a New York City hospital between 1978 and 1985. During this period, tuberculosis occurred in 15.1 percent of AIDS patients with a history of parenteral drug use and 4.4 percent of all other patients with AIDS. The yearly rate of tuberculosis more than doubled during the study period; this increase was entirely attributable to cases among patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex and parenteral drug users, a group at high risk for the development of AIDS. Patients with AIDS and tuberculosis were younger and more frequently men than other patients with tuberculosis, and were more likely to have extrapulmonic disease. In the majority of patients, tuberculosis occurred prior to confirmation of CDC-defined AIDS. Forty-four percent of patients with AIDS-related complex at the time of diagnosis of tuberculosis subsequently developed AIDS. Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be yet another opportunistic agent to which patients with AIDS retroviral-induced immunodeficiency are susceptible.\r"

Narcotics cause greater depression of wakeful respiration than the previously mentioned drugs; however, the influence of narcotics on the upper airway and breathing during sleep has not been studied. We, therefore, examined, in 12 healthy adults, the effects of oral hydromorphone hydrochloride (2 and 4 mg) on breathing during sleep and on a variety of awake respiratory variables (minute ventilation, gas exchange, and chemoresponsiveness). In addition, awake pharyngeal inspiratory airflow resistance was determined before and after narcotic administration to assess the drug's influence on patency of the upper airway. Following both doses, minute ventilation decreased, and carbon dioxide pressure increased. The 4-mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride also produced a significant decrement in the hypoxic ventilatory response, whereas hypercapnic responsiveness and pharyngeal resistance did not change following either dose of the drug. Despite the respiratory depression during wakefulness described previously, no significant change was observed in any measure of sleep-disordered breathing after either dose of narcotic. We conclude that in healthy individuals without suspected sleep apnea, oral hydromorphone in standard dosages does not significantly increase sleep-disordered breathing. This result may be due to a lack of selective depression of upper-airway muscular function by the doses of narcotic used.\r"

Three puffs of either BA or placebo (Plc) were administered from a metered dose inhaler (MDI) in a double-blind crossover design. They coughed a mean of 31 times after BA and 19 times after Plc. Forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1) declined a mean of 22.6 percent after BA and 22.0 percent after Plc. Pretreatment with albuterol attenuated both the cough and the drop in FEV1. Follow-up study showed that regular pretreatment with bronchodilator enabled seven of 12 patients to tolerate BA therapy. The remaining five required a short course of increased dose oral steroid therapy. Cough and wheezing are frequent side effects of BA therapy that interfere with regular compliance. Pretreatment with a bronchodilator is effective in attenuating these side effects in some patients; in others, a short course of oral steroid therapy may be necessary.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the contribution of direct cytotoxicity and immune-mediated hypersensitivity to the pathogenesis of amiodarone pneumonitis, we evaluated cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from 13 patients with amiodarone pneumonitis. Alveolar macrophages from all patients contained two types of abnormal inclusions: small clear vacuoles and large phagolysosomes containing phospholipid in lamellar structures, abnormalities previously attributed to direct cytotoxicity from amiodarone. However, these changes were always associated with abnormalities in the numbers and types of immune and inflammatory cells present in the lower respiratory tract, which closely resemble those seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with inhaled antigens. Following discontinuation of amiodarone and institution of corticosteroid therapy, clinical improvement correlated with a return toward normal in the pattern of inflammatory cells present in the lung, although alveolar macrophages continued to display evidence of drug-induced cytotoxicity. These findings support the possibility that a cell-mediated immune response usually plays a role in the pathogenesis of amiodarone pneumonitis, although direct cytotoxicity may predispose these patients to the development of this abnormal immune response.\r"

Unlike previous reports, the disease affects more within the old age and female groups. The most common symptoms were cough, followed by chills, fever and hemoptysis. Bilateral or bilobar involvement was infrequent. Common basal segments and middle lobe were the most commonly affected locations. Chest x-ray film showed consolidation in most cases. Sputum smear for AFB was positive in 37 patients. Endobronchial involvement was proved by bronchoscopy in 32 of 42 patients who received the diagnostic procedure. The major bronchoscopic findings were ulcerative granuloma, fibrostenosis, and submucosal infiltration. In rare instances, final diagnosis could be made only after exploratory thoracotomy. Besides its diagnostic merit in lower lung field tuberculosis, bronchoscopy can assess the severity of the endobronchial lesion and provide a guide to early surgical intervention in patients with severe fibrostenosis.\r"

In one case with atrial septal defect, saccular aneurysm involving each major pulmonary arterial branch was considered to have resulted from atherosclerotic disease. In each of the remaining cases, cystic medial necrosis was present, and the aneurysmal disease was the result of laceration of a major pulmonary arterial segment. In one of the cases with atrial septal defect, the laceration was recent and extended through the full thickness of the pulmonary trunk in a circumferential manner. In the remaining three cases, lacerations were usually old and had not extended through the full thickness of the involved arterial segments. Saccular aneurysm formation (usually multiple) had resulted from weakness of the wall as a result of laceration and retraction of tissue.\r"

Pathologic specimens of the IAA and surrounding rectal muscular cuff were obtained from 29 patients who had required IAA excision 17 +/- 2 months (mean +/- SEM, range, 2 to 48 months) following construction. Multiple (greater than or equal to 6) coronal and sagittal sections of each specimen were made and examined histologically. The rectal muscle cuff was bound to ileal serosa by dense fibrous tissue. Small islets of residual rectal mucosa were identified between the denuded rectal cuff and the ileal pull-through in four patients (14 percent) and at the ileoanal anastomosis in two patients (7 percent). Active rectal mucosal disease, dysplasia, or reepithelialization of the denuded rectal muscle were not seen. It is concluded that small islets of rectal mucosa may remain after IAA. Up to four years after IAA, however, no evidence of rectal mucosal regeneration could be documented.\r"
