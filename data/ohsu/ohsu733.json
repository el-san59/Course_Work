We retrospectively studied 22 consecutive fetuses with sonographically diagnosed omphalocele and available karyotype to determine whether the contents of the omphalocele could predict the karyotype. Of these 22 fetuses, 18 had normal and four had abnormal karyotypes. Sixteen of the karyotypically normal fetuses had liver herniated into the omphalocele and two had only bowel present in the defect. All four of the fetuses with abnormal chromosomes had only bowel in the defect.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the risk of maternal contamination in antenatal DNA diagnosis after second- and third-trimester transabdominal placental biopsy. For this purpose, we compared the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of 11 chorionic villus DNA samples after late chorionic villus sampling (CVS) with those of the corresponding maternal DNA. Ten of 11 aspirated tissue samples were not separated from maternal contamination before DNA extraction. All 11 mother-embryo pairs were informative for analysis of maternal contamination, ie, the mother showed one RFLP allele not present in the embryo. In none of the 11 cases did the fetal DNA show maternal contamination after molecular hybridization, although ten samples were contaminated with maternal tissue macroscopically and microscopically. Despite some maternal tissue admixture, the risk of contamination seems to be lower in the second- and third-trimester CVS than in first-trimester CVS, based on previous reports and our own experiences. This is most likely due to the anatomically closer contact of villi and decidua in the first trimester of pregnancy.\r"

If delivery did not occur within 4 days, the dose of vitamin K1 was repeated. Women whose pregnancies continued beyond 8 days received 20 mg of vitamin K1 orally every day until the end of the 34th week or until delivery, whichever occurred earlier. The median maternal plasma vitamin K1 level was significantly higher in treated than in untreated subjects (11.592 versus 0.102 ng/mL; P less than .001). The median cord plasma levels were 0.024 ng/mL in the treated group and 0.010 ng/mL in the controls, a significant difference (P = .046). Median plasma vitamin K1 levels were comparable in mothers receiving the drug by the IM route only and by both the IM and oral routes (10.533 versus 11.928 ng/mL; P = .460). The infants of the latter group, however, had significantly higher median cord plasma levels (0.42 versus 0.017 ng/mL; P less than .001). There was no correlation between cord plasma vitamin K1 levels and gestational age or duration of maternal supplementation with vitamin K1. We conclude that, in preterm pregnancies, vitamin K1 crosses the placenta slowly and to a limited degree.\r"

Although the presence of contaminants in amniotic fluid has been reported to reduce this accuracy, the literature is conflicting concerning these effects. We examined the effect of blood contamination on the accuracy of diagnosing ruptured membranes. Amniotic fluid was obtained from 38 patients between 16-38 weeks' gestational age who underwent amniocentesis. Amniotic fluid was immediately mixed with freshly obtained, heparinized fetal cord blood in varying concentrations (blood to amniotic fluid 1:5, 1:10, 1:20). The slides were examined microscopically for the presence of ferning. All samples were fern-positive, but many had atypical ferns described as \"skeletonized.\" As the concentration of blood to amniotic fluid increased, the number of atypical ferns increased (32 of 38 at 1:5, 22 of 38 at 1:10, and nine of 38 at 1:20). We conclude that the presence of blood may alter the morphology of the fern, but does not act as a contaminant that would affect the accuracy of the test.\r"

  ".W": "Little information exists to help determine the presence or significance of labor abnormalities in women attempting vaginal birth after previous cesarean. A case-control study was performed to obtain information on patterns of labor progress and the incidence of dysfunctional labor in patients having a trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery. Sixty-eight such women were matched to nulliparous and multiparous controls. Labor-curve characteristics for the group of women with previous cesarean differed significantly from those of both the nulliparas and multiparas. When stratified by history of previous vaginal birth, however, those with no previous vaginal birth were indistinguishable from nulliparous controls and those with a previous vaginal birth were indistinguishable from multiparous controls. Parity-specific criteria for the diagnosis of dysfunctional labor were thus indicated. Labor disorders were present most frequently in the previous-cesarean group with no previous vaginal birth (41.9%). This incidence did not differ significantly from that in the control nulliparas (27.1%) (P = .15), but did differ from that in the multiparas (15.8%) (P less than .01). Previous-cesarean patients with a previous vaginal birth had a frequency of labor disorders (14.3%) not significantly different from that of multiparous controls. We conclude that trial of labor in women with a previous cesarean should be evaluated by standard criteria for nulliparas if there has been no previous vaginal birth, and by criteria for multiparous women if there has been any previous infant born vaginally.\r"

  ".U": "90159403\r", 
  ".W": "When used for patients undergoing trial of labor after previous cesarean, oxytocin is associated with an increased failure rate. Previous reports have not studied why this occurs. From October 1984 to April 1986, 237 patients with previous cesareans underwent a trial of labor. The delivery outcomes of 73 women who received oxytocin were compared with those of the 164 who did not. Rates were similar for uterine scar dehiscence, uterine rupture, operative vaginal delivery, blood transfusions, endometritis, and low Apgar scores. Successful trial of labor occurred in 68% in the oxytocin group, compared with 89% in the no-oxytocin group. Failed trial of labor was significantly more frequent in patients who received oxytocin for induction of labor than in those who did not. When subjects who received oxytocin were divided into induction (N = 47) and augmentation (N = 26) groups, successful trial of labor occurred in 58% of the former group versus 88% of the latter group. Other characteristics of the augmentation group were spontaneous labor, greater cervical dilation and effacement at initiation of oxytocin, shorter duration of infusion, and lower oxytocin infusion rates. For patients who have had previous cesareans and who desire trial of labor, oxytocin by controlled infusion is safe. Successful trial of labor may be enhanced by awaiting spontaneous labor or inducing with a favorable cervix.\r"

Comparison of the 2-year periods before and after September 1984 showed that the cesarean rate had dropped from 16.8 to 8.0%, the maternal mortality rate from 202 to 57 per 100,000 births, and the perinatal mortality rate from 71.9 to 56.2 per 1000 births. During the latter period, use of oxytocin increased from 3.4 to 17.4%. These findings suggest that the adoption of strict guidelines can lead to a decrease in the cesarean rate and an improvement in obstetric outcome.\r"

Each group was divided into two subgroups, one of which received an iron supplement (4 mg ferrous sulfate/kg/day). We investigated iron supplements because excess dietary iron has been suggested to inhibit zinc absorption. 65Zn retention from labeled meals was studied in the dams during pregnancy and lactation and in their 10-day-old infants. In both the mothers and the infants, zinc absorption/retention, as measured by whole-body counting, was more than 25% higher in the low-zinc group than in the controls. Iron supplementation had no effect on initial dietary zinc retention, but resulted in a reduction in whole-body 65Zn turnover. Thus, changes in zinc status and dietary factors such as iron can affect net retention and turnover of zinc in pregnant and lactating primates fed low-zinc diets.\r"

Fifteen (45%) of the subjects had a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, including all three, 12 of 20 (60%), and none of ten of those with primary, secondary, and latent syphilis, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (73%), uterine contractions (67%), and decreased fetal movement (67%). The signs or symptoms began 2-8 hours after treatment; fevers peaked at 6-12 hours post-therapy and the events usually abated by 16-24 hours after treatment. Uterine contractions and decreased fetal activity began concurrent with maternal fever in eight of ten women reporting contractions. Transient late decelerations were detected in three of 11 monitored patients. Three of the women with Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions delivered infants with congenital syphilis, including one stillbirth, but none of those without a detectable reaction had fetal treatment failures. Prostaglandin F2 alpha and prostacyclin metabolites were elevated transiently in the one subject studied, suggesting their role in mediating the cardiovascular and uterine events in the post-treatment period. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in pregnancy is similar in frequency, character, and intensity to that in nonpregnant adults, but gravidas may have increase uterine activity and transient alterations in fetal well-being. The pregnant patient with a severely affected fetus with congenital syphilis may experience preterm labor, preterm delivery, or fetal death in association with the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.\r"

Significant increases were found in fibrinopeptide A (P less than .01), beta thromboglobulin (P less than .001), platelet factor 4 (P less than .02), and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (P less than .001), suggesting increased platelet turnover, clotting, and fibrinolysis.

In the group who had gestational diabetes, glucose tolerance remained abnormal by the Mercy Maternity Hospital criterion in 28% of those who had been delivered vaginally and in 43% of those delivered by cesarean. The only abnormal test in the control group was in one of the two women delivered by cesarean, and this test returned to normal by the seventh postoperative day. By 6 weeks postpartum, the incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance was 24 and 30% for patients having vaginal and abdominal deliveries, respectively. The method of infant feeding had no significant influence on the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance. We conclude that if a glucose tolerance test has not been performed prenatally, the test is still worthwhile in the immediate puerperium if the possibility of gestational diabetes has been raised by adverse pregnancy outcome, because about one in three diabetics will be thus identified. However, screening in the puerperium is not a substitute for prenatal screening.\r"

Patients in the study group were also more likely to be on active military duty, to have undergone previous nongynecologic surgery, and to have sought treatment for unrelated somatic complaints. Finally, although the mean ages at first intercourse were similar, women with idiopathic pelvic pain reported a higher total number of sexual partners and were significantly more likely to have experienced previous significant psychosexual trauma. These findings confirm that predisposing psychosocial variables are important in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pelvic pain and emphasize the significance of multidisciplinary evaluation and management.\r"

In four cases the endometrial cavity communicated with the tubal lumen, hematometra was present in three cases, and endometriosis was diagnosed in six. In six of the seven rudimentary horns without hematometra, the endometrial mucosa did not correspond to the cycle phase of the endometrium of the hemiuterus; however, in the three rudimentary horns with hematometra, the endometrium presented cycle-phase characteristics similar to those of the hemiuterus. The endometrio-myometrial junction, the underlying myometrium, and the arcuate arterioles were always altered. We consider that the absence of cyclic changes in the endometria of the smaller horns may be attributed to reduced vascular supply, to the absence of any isthmocervical structure, and to the qualitative and/or quantitative differences in endometrial mucosal receptors.\r"

How can poor women be reached for screening and early diagnosis of cervical cancer and its precursor stages? One answer to this question is based on the observation that a high percentage of the unscreened population has received some form of medical care within the previous 5 years. Emergency centers and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics often provide such care to patients who lack a regular source of health care. Thus, they represent potential resources for cervical cancer screening. However, in a survey of 19 hospitals whose patient populations include a high proportion of low-income patients, only five reported a protocol for cervical cancer screening in their emergency centers. Similarly, all 11 STD clinics included in this survey reported that fewer than 5% of their female patients had a Papanicolaou smear taken even though virtually all of them received a pelvic examination. Based on these findings, it appears that health care administrators and policymakers could intensify their cancer prevention programs by mobilizing these resources for cancer control.\r"

Flow rates were determined comparing two types of influx tubing, two different heights of the fluid source, and a range of inflatable cuff pressures. The flow rate of this system with urologic irrigation tubing at pressures of 150 mmHg was comparable to that of a commercially available irrigator-aspirator system. The instrument has been used in 15 routine and emergency operative laparoscopy cases and provides adequate aquadissection, rapid and easy maintenance of a clean operative field, smoke evacuation during laser vaporization, and atraumatic suction traction of tissues.\r"

In the second stage, 34 women accomplished home monitoring in addition to the regular in-hospital NSTs prescribed by their physicians. The total of 72 patients, whose gestations ranged from 29-43 weeks, attempted 307 recordings, of which 93% were transmitted successfully. Ninety-eight percent of the received NSTs were considered interpretable. Based on our results, it seems that the use of the home fetal monitor by the patient in conjunction with all of the other components of a tertiary perinatal care center is feasible, reliable, and safe.\r"

Numerous technical problems have significantly hampered the ability to make accurate predictions on tissues obtained early in gestation. Applying the technique of molecular genetic \"fingerprinting\" in two gestations in which parentage was uncertain, we found that paternity can be established readily using DNA obtained from amniocytes or chorionic villi. The accuracy of this method exceeds that of conventional protein-based assays and is not decreased by variations in gene expression. Multiple analyses can be performed on restriction endonuclease digests of DNA present in very small amounts of cellular material normally obtained by routine prenatal diagnostic techniques. The simplicity, speed, reliability, and accuracy of molecular genetic analysis make it ideally suited to address questions of familial relationship in the prenatal period.\r"

We report a case of unilateral twin tubal gestation in which zygosity of the twins was determined by using DNA probes that detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms. We used six human DNA probes and M13 phage DNA to compare the genotypes of the twins. Three of the six human probes and the M13 probe showed differences, proving that these twins were dizygotic. We speculate that many of the unilateral ectopic twins who were thought to be monozygotic may actually have been dizygotic.\r"

Because clinical staging often is inaccurate in cervical cancer patients with a history of endometriosis, pre-treatment operative assessment should be considered and frozen sections are recommended to assist with intraoperative management whenever the diagnosis of endometriosis could be entertained.\r"

An 18-year-old woman underwent evaluation and treatment for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome with vulvar involvement. Preoperative evaluation included consultation with pediatric surgeons, gynecologic surgeons, and an interventional radiologist as well as individual and family psychological counseling. Attention to intraoperative detail resulted in minimal operative blood loss and preservation of normal anatomy. A postoperative hematoma was treated aggressively with surgical evacuation and drainage. Six-month follow-up revealed functionally and cosmetically normal vulvar anatomy.\r"

Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. As an alpha-blocker, it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra. The patient's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil. Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication. The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length. Patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery, because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy.\r"

In six of eight eyes, a shallow pocket of loculated fluid developed with small subretinal pigment precipitates, possibly a unique feature associated with pneumatic retinopexy. Although loculated DSRFA may not affect the anatomic success, poor visual outcome can result if the macula is involved (4 eyes). Loculated submacular DSRFA may cause bothersome postoperative symptoms, because its resolution may be prolonged for months. Factors found significantly associated with DSRFA were subretinal precipitates and heavy cryotherapy. Demarcation lines, dependent subretinal fluid by the macula, long duration of detachment, and phakic status were factors more frequently found in eyes with than without DSRFA, although the correlations lacked statistical significance. A detailed description of loculated DSRFA after pneumatic retinopexy not found in the literature is presented.\r"

Estimated relative risks for uveal melanoma associated with nonskin cancers were 1.2 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.61-2.3) and 0.9 (95% Cl, 0.49-1.5) for RDD and sibling comparisons, respectively. Prior skin malignancy (melanoma and basal or squamous cell types) tended to increase the estimated risk in both groups (case/RDD comparison: relative risk, 1.5; 95% Cl, 0.67-3.5 and case/sibling comparison: relative risk, 1.7; 95% Cl, 0.93-2.9). Among females, history of a malignancy was associated with a higher risk in the case/RDD comparison only (relative risk estimate, 2.2; 95% Cl, 0.97-5.1). These results suggest that the association of prior malignancies with uveal melanoma is weak. Cutaneous malignancies and uveal melanomas may share some common risk factors.\r"

In rural areas, trauma resulting in endophthalmitis frequently involves injuries with perforating objects that are contaminated with organic matter. These rural cases therefore may not be comparable with endophthalmitis occurring after nonrural injuries. A 10-year retrospective analysis was performed to investigate the incidence of rural endophthalmitis as well as determine the type of causative organisms. Endophthalmitis developed in 24 (30%) of 80 patients with rural penetrating trauma, compared with 23 (11%) of 204 patients with nonrural penetrating trauma. Of 24 patients, Bacillus spp were isolated in 11 (46%), followed by gram-negative rods in 7, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 6, and streptococcal species in 5. In 10 (42%) of these 24 patients with rural trauma, more than one organism was isolated. Bacillus spp were involved in six (60%) of ten of these mixed infections. Based on these findings, the authors suggest an intravitreal regimen of gentamicin along with either vancomycin or clindamycin for the empiric therapy of rural endophthalmitis.\r"

In nine cases, the retinopathy was bilateral. Similar changes were found in 6 (16.2%) of 37 clinically normal individuals from southern villages on Guam that have a high incidence of Lytico-Bodig, and in 1 (3.1%) of 32 individuals from Saipan, an island north of Guam that has a low incidence of the disease. These results indicate the possibility of an association-between Lytico-Bodig and a retinopathy on Guam that may be parasitic in origin.

Evidence of progression of the macular disease was sought through comparison of the recent fundus findings with old fundus photographs and from subjective complaints of worsening visual acuity. Only 1 of the 22 affected subjects had evidence of such change. Additionally, two new findings of NCMD were observed: (1) severe macular lesions which were staphylomatous or excavated in appearance, not flat, and atrophic as previously described; and (2) peripheral retinal drusen variably present in affected subjects, in contrast to the \"normal peripheral retina\" originally described. These new findings, along with the generally stable course of the disease would seem to alter our understanding of the relationship of NCMD to other dominant macular dystrophies.\r"

Many of Sorsby's original conclusions were confirmed, including the pattern of inheritance and age of visual loss. Yellow material was present at the level of Bruch's membrane early in the course of the disease. However, the earliest phenotypic marker was delayed filling of the choriocapillaris. Abnormalities of choroidal perfusion became more profound and extended centrifugally with time. The loss of central vision was commonly due to atrophy of the outer retina and choroid. Subretinal neovascularization was a rare occurrence. The homology between this dystrophy and age-related macular disease underlines the importance of the clinical findings in this family.\r"

The mechanism was believed to be bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve compression. Review of the 36 previously reported cases of FKS revealed that 12 cases (33%) were probably also caused by bilateral optic nerve compression. Only eight (22%) of the cases satisfied Foster Kennedy's original hypothesis for the pathogenesis of his syndrome, namely, direct compression of one optic nerve causing atrophy and increased intracranial pressure causing contralateral papilledema. In 15 (41%) reported cases of FKS, descriptions were inadequate to determine a mechanism, while two (5%) were probably caused by long-standing increased intracranial pressure without direct optic nerve compression. The authors believe that as sophisticated imaging permits earlier diagnosis and more precise localization, most future cases of FKS caused by mass lesions will be found to result from bilateral direct optic nerve compression.\r"

The initial histopathologic diagnosis was malignant medulloepithelioma with orbital extension. Closer study revealed a superotemporal chorioretinal and ciliary body coloboma; dysplasia of the adjacent retina; a glioneuromatous mass replacing the temporal ciliary body, chamber angle structures, and iris and extending through the sclera to involve the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle; neuroepithelial elements resembling medulloepithelioma; and abnormally developed iris pigment epithelium, and dilator and sphincter muscles. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the main mass consisted of neurons positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin and neurofilaments, and glial cells expressing vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S-100 protein. The neuroepithelial elements reacted positively for cytokeratins and S-100 protein, in addition to NSE and vimentin, suggesting ciliary epithelial rather than embryonic retinal origin. The tumor was rediagnosed as glioneuroma, which in this case was part of a widespread colobomatous dysplasia of the anterior uvea and retina. The patient is alive without metastases or local recurrence 2 years following enucleation and subtotal removal of the lesion.\r"

Oral manifestations were observed in 89 (41%) patients. Of these, 15 had asymptomatic infection, 23 had lymphadenopathy syndrome, 27 had AIDS-related complex, and 24 had AIDS. Increasing severity of disease was significantly associated with higher prevalence of oral lesions (p less than or equal to 0.0001). Candidiasis was the most common oral lesion, followed by hairy leukoplakia. Kaposi's sarcoma, melanotic macules, herpes labialis, condyloma acuminatum, perioral molluscum contagiosum, and bacterial glossitis due to Escherichia coli infection were found in a small number of patients. Results of culture for fungi, available for 203 patients, revealed that 51% of patients with positive Candida cultures had clinical evidence of candidiasis. Our study demonstrates that oral lesions are also important signs of HIV infection among IVDAs. Early diagnosis of these manifestations is becoming increasingly significant in the practice of dentistry.\r"

Teeth treated with the two Ca(OH)2 materials showed resolution of the inflammatory response and hard tissue formation at the exposure site as early as 10 days postoperatively, with consistent healing at 21 days and longer. Teflon had a similar soft tissue healing pattern but at a slower rate. Hard tissue formation at the exposure site in the teeth treated with Teflon was infrequent at the early time periods and present in only 20% of the teeth treated for 5 and 8 weeks. By evaluating the soft and hard tissue responses of the Ca(OH)2-capped and Teflon-capped teeth it may be possible, in future studies, to identify events unique to odontoblast differentiation during pulpal healing.\r"

The range was 51 years, with a maximum of 77 years and a minimum of 26 years. There is a positive correlation, which could not have occurred by chance, that as age increases the deviation and the width of the foramen opening both increase. This increase appears to be a result of apical cemental thickening that occurs as the patient ages. The tissue in the apical area seems to be capable of generating additional cementum as the tooth ages. The cementodentinal junction width, or most apical extent of the dentin, remains constant.\r"

Submentovertex radiographs of 18 human cadaver specimens were made. The radiographic condylar dimensions, morphologic condylar outline, and angle of the condylar axis with respect to the transmeatal line were determined. The specimens were dissected and disarticulated, and radiographic findings were compared to anatomic structure. Osseous abnormalities were found in 21 of the 36 joints studied (58%). Perforations of the disk were found in nine of 31 joints (29%) investigated. No statistically significant differences between the normal condyles and condyles displaying osseous abnormalities were found in any of the radiographic parameters studied.\r"

Data were collected from the mothers by personal interview; standardized tests were administered to mothers and children (Denver Developmental Screening Test, Simmons Behavior Checklist, Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist. The data indicate that many homeless children and poor children with homes have severe and pressing problems. Among preschool children, a higher proportion of homeless children than poor children with homes had one or more developmental delays (P less than .05), although their scores on the Simmons Behavior Checklist were similar. Among school-aged children, the scores of the homeless children were worse than those of the children with homes on the Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist, but only the difference on the Anxiety Scale approached statistical significance (P = .06). Both homeless children and poor children with homes generally had worse scores than most other comparison groups of children. Unless action is taken to improve the lot of all these children, it is likely that many will continue to have significant problems that will seriously hamper their ability to function.\r"

Despite an increasing prevalence of chronic childhood conditions and heightened concerns for the quality of life of the chronically ill, population-based studies of behavior problems among children with chronic physical conditions are rare. Findings on the epidemiology of behavior problems in a nationally representative sample of 11,699 children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in the United States are reported. Data included a 32-item parent-reported behavior problem index, measures of chronic childhood conditions, measures of school placement and performance, and sociodemographic variables. Analyses confirmed that chronic physical conditions were a significant risk factor for behavior problems, independent of sociodemographic variables. Among children these differences were observed across all subscales; among adolescents the largest differences were found for the Depression/Anxiety and Peer Conflict/Social Withdrawal subscales. Rates of extreme behavior problem scores (those in the top 10th percentile) were 1.55 times higher among children with a chronic health condition compared with children without a chronic condition (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.86). These independent odds were lowered to 1.44 when covariates for confounding were introduced via a multivariate logistic regression. Other independent risks included the absence of either biologic parent (odds ratio 2.05), male gender (1.53), low vs high family income (1.30), low vs high maternal education (1.51), and young vs old maternal age at childbirth (2.57). Chronic health conditions were also a major risk factor for placement in special education classes and having to repeat grades. Despite evidence for effective interventions, health services for children with chronic conditions--particularly mental health services--remain fragmented, signaling the need for increased attention to behavioral problems and their treatment among all health professionals caring for children.\r"

However, many patients with bulimia nervosa, even those of average or greater than average weight, also experience menstrual abnormalities, including amenorrhea. It was hypothesized that low weight per se is not responsible for menstrual dysfunction in patients with eating disorders. First, 16 patients with bulimia nervosa of average weight and 29 patients with cystic fibrosis of below average weight of similar menstrual age were compared. Of the patients with bulimia nervosa, 11 (73%) had had secondary amenorrhea at some time compared with 8 (28%) of the patients with cystic fibrosis (P less than .01). At the time of study, 6 (40%) of the patients with bulimia nervosa and 21 (78%) of the patients with cystic fibrosis were having regular cycles (P less than .01). Next 18 patients with anorexia nervosa were compared with 18 patients with cystic fibrosis matched for weight and menstrual age. Although 18 (100%) of the patients with anorexia nervosa had had secondary amenorrhea, only 6 (33%) of the patients with cystic fibrosis had amenorrhea. Although only 1 (6%) of the anorexia nervosa group was currently having regular cycles, 14 (78%) of the patients with cystic fibrosis were (P less than .0001). Closer approximation to ideal body weight was associated with regular menses only in the cystic fibrosis group. Exercise did not appear related to regularity of menstruation in any group. Body weight is not the major factor responsible for menstrual abnormalities in patients with eating disorders.\r"

In addition, 73 age-matched previously unimmunized subjects were vaccinated with PRP or PRP-D. In all groups, adverse reactions were minor and resolved by 48 hours. Subjects receiving booster immunization with PRP or PRP-D had significantly greater antibody responses than children of the same age receiving their first dose of vaccine.

  ".W": "A prospective study of immunogenicity and adverse effects of 1553 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) was performed in 538 children observed longitudinally from 2 months to 20 months of age. Subjects were randomized to the standard four-dose immunization schedule or to a three-dose schedule (with a saline injection substituted for DTP at 6 months of age). The three-dose schedule could not be recommended on the basis of serologic data. Compliance for completing a clinical observation form in the 48 hours following injections was greater than 99%. Fever, local reactions, or adverse behavioral effects were described in association with 96% of DTP doses and 36% of placebo injections. Contraindications to DTP immunization developed in 3% of study children. No convulsion, hypotonic hyporesponsive episode, encephalopathy, or temperature greater than 40.5 degrees C occurred. Behavioral and local inflammatory effects occurred maximally in the first 6 hours following vaccine but fever peaked later. There was no interrelationship between occurrence of local reaction and fever. Data suggest that age has more effect on the type and rate of adverse clinical events than does vaccine dose number. Existing antibody levels to vaccine components, lot of vaccine, breast-feeding, or gestational age did not affect rate or type of clinical reactions. Neither occurrence of reactions nor the use of acetaminophen affected antibody response to vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "This paper is an examination of the extent to which adolescents in primary care indicated behavioral risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the degree to which their clinic records reflected either awareness of such conditions or interventions for them. Levels of risk were assigned to the youths based on known risk factors in adult populations and arbitrarily selected natural breaks in the frequency of sexual behaviors. Of the sample, 3% were at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection because the adolescents engaged in prostitution, injectable drug use, male homosexual behavior, or had a sexually transmitted disease associated with genital ulcers or sores; 16% were at moderate risk because the youths had more than six sexual partners in the year preceding the interview or had nonulcerative forms of sexually transmitted disease; and the remainder were at low risk. Fewer than half of the youths at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection sought or received help for any of their problem behaviors, while virtually all sought and received help for sexually transmitted diseases. Because a high proportion of the youths engaging in risky behaviors had sexually transmitted diseases, the most promising approach for prevention of human immunodeficiency disease infection is through health clinics that treat sexually transmitted diseases. These clinics could screen the youths for associated behavioral risk factors, and then offer preventive or interventive services.\r"

Therefore, 813 children between 9 and 14 years of age were examined by a team of cardiologists and technicians. The children also responded to a questionnaire concerning the presence of symptoms and the What I Think and Feel anxiety instrument. The prevalence of mitral valve prolapse using auscultatory criteria was 4.2% (6.2% for girls, 2.3% for boys). Of those with mitral valve prolapse, 85% had a solitary click, 9% had a click and systolic murmur, and 6% had multiple clicks. Children with auscultatory mitral valve prolapse were less likely to have symptoms than those free of cardiac abnormalities. No difference in average anxiety scores was detected between the two groups. It is concluded that auscultatory mitral valve prolapse is common in children and not accompanied by an increased likelihood of symptoms or anxiety.\r"

  ".W": "A immunodeficiency of natural killer cells as effectors for natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxicities was first demonstrated in siblings. Two of three male siblings persistently lacked natural killer activity against K562 target cells as assayed by a 51Cr-release assay: percent lysis values were less than 1.0% as compared to the normal lymphocyte values of 43.5% +/- 6.2% (mean +/- SD). Their lymphocytes did not develop natural killer cell activity by changing effector to target ratios, prolonging the incubation time, or stimulating them with interferon-alpha or interleukin 2. Numbers of lymphocytes bearing Leu-7, CD16, or NKH-1 were normal but those of Leu-7-, CD16+ cells were decreased as estimated by flow cytometry. Single cell-in-agarose assays showed normal numbers of natural killer cells capable of binding to a target cell but incapable of killing it. They had depressed levels of lymphokine-activated killer activity, which was totally eliminated by the treatment with OKT3 and complement. This result indicates that the patients' natural killer cells are also defective in the capacity to work as effectors for lymphokine-activated killer activity. The patients' natural killer cells did not produce natural killer cytotoxic factor activity. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cytotoxic T lymphocyte cytotoxicity were normal. These results demonstrate a selective natural killer cell deficiency as effectors for natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxicities with a familial tendency, in which there is defective killing with the absence of natural killer cytotoxic factor activity.\r"

In a multicenter study involving 10 sites in six states, infants were vaccinated with three 10-micrograms doses of HbOC at 2-month intervals. Side effects associated with vaccination were mild, transient, and occurred in fewer than 2% of the subjects. More than 90% of infants of all ages responded after two doses, and more than 98% had anti-H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (HbPs) antibody levels greater than or equal to 1 microgram/mL after three doses. One month after the third vaccination, the geometric mean anti-HbPs antibody levels were 16.84, 26.23, and 29.11 in infants initially vaccinated at 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6 months of age, respectively. A long-term antibody response was observed; more than 80% of these infants had anti-HbPs levels greater than or equal to 1 microgram/mL at 2 years of age. The HbOC generated an immune response characteristic of a protein antigen; IgG anti-HbPs antibodies of IgG1 subclass predominated and the response could be boosted. The immune sera killed H influenzae type b when evaluated in an in vitro bactericidal assay. The data indicate that HbOC safely primed and boosted the immune system of young infants, providing long-lasting protective levels of anti-HbPs antibodies.\r"

All subjects participated in the same 16-week program but had different levels of parent participation: (1) child alone with no parent participation; (2) mother and child treated in the same session; and (3) mother and child treated in separate but concurrent session. At the end of the 16-week program, children in the three conditions lost 1.6, 3.7, and 3.1 kg, respectively. Differences among conditions were not statistically significant; however, a secondary analysis revealed that the greater the number of sessions attended by mothers, the greater their daughters' weight losses. Weight reduction was associated with significant improvements in body composition, serum total cholesterol concentrations, and psychological status. Results are discussed in terms of the need to improve the maintenance of weight loss in adolescents and to explore possible differences between black and white females in their preferred body types.\r"

To determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of children with cancer who had AMS, the medical records of all children under 18 years of age with systemic cancer (excluding primary central nervous system tumors) who had AMS in our institution during the years 1981 through 1987 were reviewed. AMS developed in 89 of 815 children at risk (11%). The AMS was caused by seizures in 53 (60%), an encephalopathy in 24 (27%), and a stroke syndrome in 12 (13%). AMS occurred in 42 of 305 (14%) with leukemia, 16 of 139 (12%) with lymphoma, 14 of 136 (10%) with sarcoma, 10 of 104 (9%) with neuroblastoma, and 7 of 104 (5%) with other malignancies. Children with acute lymphocytic leukemia were more prone to having seizures (61%), while children with nonacute lymphocytic leukemia were almost equally likely to have encephalopathies, strokes, or seizures. Children with lymphoma were admitted for treatment most often with an encephalopathy (44%). Etiologies for AMS were evaluated vigorously, and one or more etiologies were identified in 80 of 89 (89%) patients. Dependent on the type of tumor, the anticancer treatment used and, timing during the course of illness AMS occurred, specific diagnoses were more likely. Neurologic morbidity and mortality were dependent on the cause of AMS. Children with seizures that were initially difficult to control were more likely to require long-term anticonvulsant therapy.\r"

The infants were born in 1983 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, had birth weights less than 1300 g, were examined weekly until neonatal intensive care unit discharge, and did not develop cerebral palsy. Lower-extremity flexor tone was first detectable at 29 weeks post-menstrual age by the popliteal angle and heel to ear maneuvers. Flexor tone, recoil, and hyperreflexia were all noted 2 to 3 weeks earlier in the lower extremities (33 to 35 weeks) than in the upper extremities (35 to 37 weeks). Hip tone (35 to 37 weeks) followed knee flexor tone, but preceded shoulder tone (37 to 38 weeks). Trunk tone on ventral suspension emerged closer to term (36 to 40 weeks), and more than half of infants evaluated at term continued to demonstrate head lag when pulled to sitting position. The emergence of the primitive and pathologic reflexes reflects (both in timing and pattern) the evolution of tone: development of the reflexes in the lower extremities precedes that of those in the upper extremities, and development of the distal reflexes precedes that of the proximal. Maturation of tone, deep tendon reflexes, pathologic reflexes, and primitive reflexes occurs in an orderly, sequential manner, with a well-defined pattern: caudocephalad (lower extremities to upper extremities) and centripetal (distal to proximal).\r"

First, very-low-birth-weight infants were more likely than term infants to have significant discrepancies between either their fine motor or language abilities and their early problem-solving skills as measured by the Adaptive scale of the Gesell. Second, across all fields of behavior (adaptive, gross motor, fine motor, language, and personal/social), very-low-birth-weight infants scored significantly below term infants. The very-low-birth-weight infant's motor performance significantly correlated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, and number of days spent in the hospital. Language performance significantly correlated with intracranial hemorrhage, birth weight, and sex. These findings underscore the limitations of global developmental scores to describe adequately the developmental performance of very-low-birth-weight infants. Instead, a comprehensive assessment of all fields of behavior is necessary to provide an accurate profile of this high-risk group.\r"

Those children whose composite reading score was 6 months behind their chronologic age on the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery were classified as having reading delay. Relationships to reading outcome were assessed for individual infant milestones, for critical screening values, and by statistical techniques that characterized the developmental process rather than single milestones. Significant differences (P less than .05) were noted between children with and without reading delays for the following milestones: 4 to 6 words, 7 to 20 words, 50 words, 2-word sentences, and 5 and 8 body parts. The positive predictive value of slower milestone achievement ranged from 0% to 50%. Techniques that focused on the developmental process during the first 2 years (either rate of achievement of neurodevelopmental milestones or order of milestone acquisition) were better able to classify children with reading delay (sensitivity = .73, specificity = .78). Although the language milestone measures did not classify children sufficiently well to be diagnostic, the data served to determine whether a child would be at high risk based on performance rather than historical factors.\r"

The performance of both groups progressed on tasks measuring motor speed and coordination as well as tactile integration. Although the children achieving below grade level continued to perform the majority of tasks poorly in comparison with the children performing at grade level, on most of the measures they evidenced definite catch-up or greater gain than the children performing at grade level. Their progress on the motor speed and coordination tasks supports the hypothesis of a developmental lag in these areas. Results of tests of motor inhibition were notable for an absence of progression. That children achieving below grade level did not advance in this area would argue against the hypothesis of a developmental lag for all soft signs. Although results of this longitudinal study are preliminary, findings to date would allow for the possibility that both deficits and lags are responsible for the differences between the academically normal and academically at-risk children.\r"

The two groups did not differ in the incidence of parental or child depressive symptomatology, motor diagnoses, language disorders, conduct disorders, and psychosomatic complaints. That only 29 children in whom ADD was absent (4.7% of all referrals) had been given a trial of stimulant medication does not support the presence of a major abuse of such drugs in the community.\r"

These offspring also have increased cortical concentrations of biogenic amines associated with hyperactivity and learning deficits. In this experiment, rats with a relatively mild degree of methylazoxymethanol-induced cortical hypoplasia were studied to determine whether these neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities persisted. Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats were injected intraperitoneally on day 15 of gestation with methylazoxymethanol acetate (25 mg/kg). Total brain weight was reduced by 12% and cortical slab weight by 28% in methylazoxymethanol-exposed offspring. They were more active than control rats and showed a trend toward slower learning in a swim maze. Affected offspring had increased cortical concentrations of norepinephrine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and glycine. There was no significant difference in the concentrations of serotonin gamma-aminobutyric acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or glutamine. Methylazoxymethanol-lesioned animals with mild cortical hypoplasia remained measurably hyperactive and may serve as a model for the study of neurotransmitter and neuropathologic abnormalities associated with hyperactivity in children with microcephaly.\r"

Medical and developmental characteristics of 97 children, adolescents, and young adults (age range 11 months to 21 years, 11 months) assessed and treated for self-injurious behavior in a specialized, interdisciplinary inpatient unit between 1980 and 1988 were reviewed. This population differed from those reported in previous studies in that it was of school age and predominantly community based. Severe or profound mental retardation was present in 82.5% of our patients. The causative diagnoses associated with self-injurious behavior were similar to those of severe mental retardation alone. Associated disabilities represented at greater than expected frequencies included pervasive developmental disorders, visual impairment, and a history of infantile spasms. Most patients (81.4%) engaged in more than one type of self-injurious behavior. The most common topographies were head banging, biting, head hitting, body hitting, and scratching. Physical injury was documented in 77% of cases; the injuries most frequently reported were excoriations, scars/callus formation, hematomas, and local infection. As community placement of handicapped individuals continues to increase, pediatricians will be called upon to monitor patients who engage in self-injurious behavior.\r"

Based on parental report, children with ADD-H had significantly more complaints of earaches during the preceding 3 months and significantly more ear infections during the preceding year. Specifically, no between-group differences were observed for total number of ear infections since birth, extended antibiotic therapy, tympanostomy tube placement, or recent hearing problems. Although middle ear disease in preschool children has repeatedly been linked to later language deficits, this study suggests that middle ear disease in school-age children may also be associated with hyperactivity and/or inattention, independently of learning disability.\r"

IgG obtained from serum of sheep injected with human metallothionein 1 was used in this competitive assay. Subjects were fed a semipurified zinc-deficient diet (0.7 mg of zinc per kg of diet) for an 8-day depletion period after 3 days of acclimation. Fasting plasma zinc concentrations were reduced approximately 7%. Metallothionein in the erythrocyte lysates was significantly decreased to 59% of the initial level by the end of the depletion period. Supplementation of these depleted subjects with zinc (50 mg) did not increase erythrocyte metallothionein levels within 24 hr. Daily supplementation of control subjects with zinc (50 mg/day) increased erythrocyte metallothionein to a 7-fold maximum within 7 days. These levels were reduced by 61% within 14 days after zinc supplementation was terminated. Incubation of rat [35S]metallothionein with human erythrocyte lysate showed a time-dependent increase in 35S soluble in 20% trichloroacetic acid, indicating degradation of the labeled protein, presumably via protease activity in the lysate. It is proposed that zinc supplementation induces erythrocyte metallothionein during erythropoiesis and that low zinc intake decreases synthesis and/or accelerates degradation of the protein in reticulocytes/erythrocytes. Metallothionein levels in erythrocytes may provide a useful index upon which to assess zinc status in humans.\r"

Candidate p75/150 cDNA clones were isolated from a D98/AH.2 (HeLa) cDNA library using oligonucleotide probes derived from p75/150 partial peptide sequence data. A data base search revealed close similarity of p75/150 with intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) [Berger, J., Garantini, E., Hua, J. C. & Udenfriend, S. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 695-698]. We demonstrate that p75/150 is identical to HeLa IAP by the following criteria: (i) 47/49 amino acid identity of p75 peptide sequence with IAP, (ii) restriction maps for the p75/150 candidate cDNA clone and IAP are identical, (iii) partial DNA sequence analysis of p75/150 candidate cDNA clones revealed complete nucleotide identity with IAP, except for a single nucleotide substitution in the 5' untranslated region, (iv) transfection of a p75/150 cDNA expression vector into the nontumorigenic hybrid, CGL1, yielded p75/150 antibody-positive transfectants that also expressed partially heat-resistant alkaline phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that high levels of HeLa IAP mRNA were expressed in D98/AH.2 and the tumorigenic segregant CGL4; however, no mRNA was detected in CGL1. Nuclear run-on analyses indicate that HeLa IAP mRNA expression in the HeLa x fibroblast hybrids is regulated at the level of transcription initiation. Furthermore, evidence is discussed supporting the involvement of a chromosome 11 tumor suppressor locus in the regulation of HeLa IAP gene expression.\r"

SP6-transcribed 32P-labeled U2 small nuclear RNA precursor molecules were introduced into cultured human 293 cells by calcium phosphate-mediated uptake, as in standard DNA transfection experiments. RNase protection mapping demonstrated that the introduced pre-U2 RNA underwent accurate 3' end processing. The introduced U2 RNA was assembled into ribonucleoprotein particles that reacted with an antibody specific for proteins known to be associated with the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle. The 3' end-processed, ribonucleoprotein-assembled U2 RNA accumulated in the nuclear fraction. When pre-U2 RNA with a 7-methylguanosine group at the 5' end was introduced into cells, it underwent conversion to a 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap structure, a characteristic feature of the U-small nuclear RNAs. Pre-U2 RNA introduced with an adenosine cap (Ap-ppG) also underwent processing, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly, and nuclear accumulation, establishing that a methylated guanosine cap structure is not required for these steps in U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein biosynthesis. Beyond its demonstrated usefulness in the study of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein biosynthesis, RNA transfection may be of general applicability to the investigation of eukaryotic RNA processing in vivo and may also offer opportunities for introducing therapeutically targeted RNAs (ribozymes or antisense RNA) into cells.\r"

By using this concept, we have found that the antisense peptide Ser-Tyr-Asp-Leu complementary to the segment Gln-Ile-Val-Ala-Gly (residues 55-59) in cystatin C (an inhibitor of cysteine proteases) is located at positions 611-614 of the beta chain of human C4, the fourth component of complement. Here we describe and characterize the specific interaction between cystatin C and C4 by ligand affinity chromatography and ELISA. Interaction between the two native proteins was mimicked on replacement of one of them with the corresponding sense-antisense peptide coupled to a carrier protein, and the binding was inhibited by these synthetic peptides in solution. Through the interaction with C4, cystatin C may play a regulatory role in complement activation that might be of particular importance at tissue sites where both proteins are produced by macrophages.\r"

Control mAbs of the same isotypes and mAbs against IL-1 beta do not activate APC. In the absence of APC, mAbs against IL-1 alpha do not induce proliferation of T lymphocytes. Mitomycin C-treated activated APC still induce T-cell proliferation. Proliferation of T lymphocytes cannot be induced by culture supernatants and requires contact with APC activated by mAbs against IL-1 alpha. The observations imply that surface membrane IL-1 alpha can function as a triggering molecule on APC, which could play an important role in the initiation of immune responses by T lymphocytes.\r"

The HIV LTR is also activated by several physical and chemical agents and heterologous viral genes, including adenovirus E1a. As E1a has separable transcriptional activation and repression functions, we examined the negative regulatory effects of E1a on the expression of the HIV LTR by using a trans-dominant E1a mutant. Mutant hr5 strongly suppressed the basal activity of the LTR as well as trans-activation of the LTR by heterologous agents such as the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene or DNA-damaging agents such as mitomycin C and UV irradiation. In addition, hr5 also caused significant suppression of tat gene-mediated trans-activation. The suppression of HIV LTR expression by hr5 appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the repression of the HIV enhancer, as the activity of an enhancer test system composed of the human T-cell leukemia virus I LTR containing an HIV-1 enhancer substitution was severely repressed by hr5. Cotransfection of HIV-1 proviral DNA with hr5 DNA resulted in a significant reduction of HIV production.\r"

  ".U": "90160318\r", 
  ".W": "A number of recent studies have suggested that phosphorylation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor could modulate receptor function. Activators of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase have been shown to influence GABAA receptor function. In addition, Sweetnam et al. [Sweetnam, P. M., Lloyd, J., Gallombardo, P., Malison, R. T., Gallager, D. W., Tallman, J. F. & Nestler, E. J. (1988) J. Neurochem. 51, 1274-1284] have reported that a kinase associated with a partially purified preparation of the receptor could phosphorylate the alpha subunit of the receptor. Moreover, Kirkness et al. [Kirkness, E. F., Bovenkerk, C. F., Ueda, T. & Turner, A. J. (1989) Biochem. J. 259, 613-616] have recently shown that cAMP-dependent protein kinase could phosphorylate a muscimol binding polypeptide of the GABAA receptor. To explore the issue further, we have examined the ability of specific kinases to catalyze significant phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor that has been purified to near homogeneity. The GABAA receptor was purified as previously described using benzodiazepine affinity chromatography. The purified receptor possessed no detectable kinase activity. Protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of the beta and alpha subunits of the receptor. However, most of the phosphate incorporation was associated with the beta subunit. Two muscimol binding polypeptides designated beta 58 (Mr 58,000) and beta 56 (Mr 56,000) were present in the preparation. The higher molecular weight polypeptide, beta 58, was phosphorylated specifically by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. beta 56 was phosphorylated specifically by protein kinase C. beta 58 and beta 56 gave distinct patterns in a one-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation (mol of phosphate/mol of muscimol binding) catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was 0.52 and that catalyzed by protein kinase C was 0.38. Taken together these data confirm that there are two forms of the beta subunit of the GABAA receptor and suggest that these two forms of the beta subunit are phosphorylated by distinct kinases.\r"

Nerves regenerated into tubes coated with laminin at a rate of 0.33 mm/day after a lag of about 2 days. At 25 days, regenerating nerves had extended 23% farther into laminin-coated tubes as compared with uncoated ones. Monoclonal antibody 3A3, which functionally interferes with a dual laminin/collagen receptor, inhibited nerve regeneration into laminin-coated tubes by 32%. In contrast, monoclonal antibody JG22, which inhibits chicken matrix receptors, had no significant effect on regeneration. Immunohistochemical studies of teased adult rat sciatic nerves indicate that 3A3 bound to Schwann cells and possibly to axons. In other studies, the heterodimeric, laminin/collagen receptor recognized by 3A3 has been shown to be a member of the integrin superfamily of adhesive receptors. These data provide evidence that an integrin receptor functions in nerve regeneration in vivo.\r"

Using recombinant inbred mice, the Fli-1 locus was situated on mouse chromosome 9 close to the cellular protooncogene c-ets-1. DNA and RNA analysis suggests, however, that Fli-1 is different from ets-1. Thus, Fli-1 appears to define a distinct locus specifically involved in the induction of erythroid leukemias by F-MuLV.\r"

In both strains, virtually the entire repertoire of MBP-specific T cells recognize an N-terminal peptide fragment in the context of the I-Au molecule encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and utilize a very limited set of T-cell receptor genes. To delineate the nature of the trimolecular complex, consisting of the T-cell receptor, MBP-peptide fragment, and MHC molecule (I-Au), we have synthesized 13 variants of the 9-mer N-terminal immunodominant peptide differing at residue 4 and studied their immune recognition in vitro and in vivo. These substitutions have a striking range of effects on T-cell activation, ability to bind to the MHC molecule, and initiation of immune responses in vivo. An understanding of the autoimmune peptide/MHC/T-cell receptor interactions allowed us to design variant 9-mer peptides that have high affinity for an MHC molecule and are effective in blocking experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, possibly through two distinct mechanisms, peripheral T-cell tolerance and the inhibition of binding of the encephalitogenic peptide to the MHC molecules.\r"

The peptide-CRM conjugates induced high antibody titers against native toxin in mice (BALB/c, C57/Black, and outbred NMRI) as measured by ELISA. Upon PT challenge (0.5 microgram of toxin) of the NMRI mice, the CRM conjugates of peptides 1-17 and 169-186 fully protected the mice from PT-induced leukocytosis. Immunization with the corresponding bovine serum albumin conjugates of these two peptides also fully protected mice. Rabbit antiserum to the peptide 1-17-CRM conjugate was highly efficient in inhibiting the ADP-ribosylating activity of PT but did not neutralize the clustering effect of PT on Chinese hamster ovary cells. In contrast, the rabbit antiserum raised against the peptide 169-186-CRM conjugate neutralized the clustering effect of PT on Chinese hamster ovary cells but did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of PT. Peptide 169-186-CRM conjugates mimic the immunoglobulin binding properties of PT and also cause clustering of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The CRM conjugates of these two peptides constitute a synthetic pertussis vaccine candidate with the ability to provide a chemically well-defined, safe, and efficient pertussis vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "A method is presented for measuring rapid changes in the rate of glucose phosphorylation in mouse brain with nonradioactive 2-deoxyglucose (DG). After times as short as 1 min after DG injection, the mouse is frozen rapidly, and selected brain regions are analyzed enzymatically for DG, 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (DG6P), and glucose. The rate of glucose phosphorylation can be directly calculated from the rate of change in DG6P, the average levels of DG and glucose, and a constant derived from direct comparison of the rate of changes in glucose and DG6P after decapitation. Experiments with large brain samples provided evidence for a 2% per min loss of DG6P and at least two compartments differing in their rates of glucose metabolism, one rapidly entered by DG with glucose phosphorylation almost double that of average brain and another more slowly entered with a much lower phosphorylation rate. The method is illustrated by changes in phosphorylation within 2 min after injection of a convulsant or an anesthetic and over a 48-min time course with and without anesthesia. The sensitivity of the analytical methods can be amplified as much as desired by enzymatic cycling. Consequently, the method is applicable to very small brain samples. Examples are given for regions with volumes of 5 x 10(-4) microliters, but studies with samples as small as single large cell bodies are feasible.\r"

All authors agree that the bound intermediate of the sugar is in an open-chain form. It is suggested that the higher-temperature study of Carrell et al. may have produced an equilibrium of multiple states, whose density fits poorly to the open-chain substrate, and led to incorrect interpretation. The two groups also bound different closed-ring sugar analogues to the enzyme, but these analogues bind differently. A possible explanation consistent with all the data is that the enzyme operates by a hydride shift mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "90160330\r", 
  ".W": "Propionic acidemia is an inherited disorder of organic acid metabolism that is caused by deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC; EC 6.4.1.3). Affected patients fall into two complementation groups, pccA and pccBC (subgroups B, C, and BC), resulting from deficiency of the nonidentical alpha and beta subunits of PCC, respectively. We have detected an unusual insertion/deletion in the DNA of patients from the pccBC and pccC subgroups that replaces 14 nucleotides in the coding sequence of the beta subunit with 12 nucleotides unrelated to this region of the gene. This results in elimination of an Msp I restriction site, a 2-base-pair (bp) deletion, a frameshift, and a stop codon in the new frame approximately 100 amino acid residues proximal to the normal carboxyl terminus. Among 14 unrelated Caucasian patients in the pccBC complementation group, this unique mutation was found in 8 of 28 mutant alleles examined. Mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic DNAs revealed that the inserted 12 nucleotides do not originate in an approximately 1000-bp region around the mutation. In the course of our investigation, we identified another mutation in the same exon: a 3-bp in-frame deletion that eliminates one of two isoleucine codons immediately preceding the Msp I site. Two unrelated patients were compound heterozygotes for this single-codon deletion and for the insertion/deletion described above. We conclude that either there is a propensity for the PCC beta-subunit gene to undergo mutations of this sort at this position or, more likely, the mutations in all of the involved Caucasian patients have a common origin in preceding generations.\r"

  ".W": "The level of acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit mRNA in primary cultures of chicken myotubes increases when the spontaneous electrical activity of the myotube is suppressed by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin. This increase was prevented by two translational inhibitors: cycloheximide and anisomycin. Neither the basal level of alpha-subunit mRNA nor that of muscle-specific creatine phosphokinase mRNA was affected by these inhibitors. In contrast, cycloheximide potentiated the limited increase of alpha-subunit mRNA levels evoked by the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide. The high level of alpha-subunit mRNA elicited by tetrodotoxin treatment did not persist after subsequent addition of cycloheximide in the presence of tetrodotoxin, indicating that the continuous synthesis of protein factor(s) is necessary for this regulation. Moreover, cycloheximide decreased the high level of alpha-subunit mRNA present at early stages of in vitro maturation of muscle primary cultures without blocking the further increase of the muscle-specific creatine phosphokinase mRNA. Implications of the requirement for constant synthesis of protein factors on the induction of muscle-specific gene expression by blocking myotube electrical activity are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "During the first postnatal week, the distribution of callosal projection neurons in the rat somatosensory cortex changes from a uniform to a discontinuous pattern. To determine if this change is influenced by afferent inputs to the somatosensory cortex, the effect of both early unilateral infraorbital nerve section and unilateral removal of the dorsal thalamus on the distribution of callosal projections in rat somatosensory cortex was examined. One month after either of the above manipulations at birth, the tangential distribution of callosal projections in the somatosensory cortex was examined using the combined retrograde and anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Both manipulations alter the distribution of callosal projection neurons and terminations in the somatosensory cortex. After infraorbital nerve section, the distribution of callosal projections is altered in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex. The abnormalities observed are consistent with the altered distribution of thalamocortical projections. In addition, consistent abnormalities were observed in the pattern of callosal projections of the second somatosensory area of both hemispheres. Most notably, they are absent in a portion of the region that contains the representation of the mystacial vibrissae and sinus hairs in this area. Thalamic ablation resulted in highly aberrant patterns of callosal projections in the somatosensory cortex on the operated side, where abnormal bands and clusters of callosal projections were observed in apparently random locations. These results are interpreted as evidence that both peripheral and central inputs influence the maturational changes in the distribution of callosal projection neurons.\r"

Most mutations were found to be homozygous lethal. Because lethality is often presumptive evidence for multilocus-deletion events, 10 mutations were analyzed by Southern blot analysis with probes at, or closely linked to, several of the specific locus test markers, namely, albino (c), brown (b), and dilute (d). All eight mutations (two c; three b; two d; and one dilute-short ear [Df(d se)]) that arose in post-spermatogonial germ cells were deleted for DNA sequences. No evidence for deletion of two d-se region probes was obtained for the remaining two d mutations that arose in stem-cell spermatogonia. Six of the primary mutants also produced low litter sizes (\"semisterility\"). Karyotypic analysis has, to date, confirmed the presence of reciprocal translocations in four of the six. The high frequency of deletions and translocations among the mutations induced in post-spermatogonial stages by chlorambucil, combined with its overall high efficiency in inducing mutations in these stages, should make chlorambucil mutagenesis useful for generating experimentally valuable germ-line deletions throughout the mouse genome.\r"

While most patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy have mutations in the gene for arylsulfatase A, some patients have deficient SAP-1, as determined by immunological techniques. We now describe the molecular findings in a patient who died at 22 years of age with SAP-1 deficiency. The DNA polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify regions of cDNA which were subcloned in M13 phage DNA and sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method. The patient was found to have a 33-base-pair insertion between nucleotides 777 and 778 (numbered from the A of the ATG initiation codon). No other changes were found in the coding sequence of the cDNA from this patient. At the site of the insertion some normal people have an additional 9 base pairs, which correspond to the last 9 nucleotides at the 3' end of the insertion. The cDNAs from the second-cousin parents were amplified and sequenced, and in both two alleles were identified, one with the 33-base-pair insertion and one with no insertion. Two brothers were found to have only the normal alleles and a sister was found to have the 33-base-pair insertion and a normal allele. The findings confirm studies performed on leukocyte extracts demonstrating normal antigen levels in the two brothers and a lower level in the sister. The presence of 11 additional amino acids in the coding region of mature SAP-1 in this patient causes significant changes in the hydropathy profile compatible with the previous findings at the protein level.\r"

Since LDL accumulation in arterial lesions does not depend on recognition of LDLs by a cell-surface receptor, we synthesized an oligopeptide with the sequence of the trypsin-accessible domain of apoB that lies closest to the amino-terminal end of the protein and compared its biological activity to that of another synthetic oligopeptide with the sequence of the heparin- and apoB/apoE receptor-binding domains of apoE. (Tyrosine was added at the amino-terminal end of each peptide to facilitate radiolabeling.) The 18-amino acid apoB-based peptide included residues 1000-1016 of apoB, for which no function has been previously described. In radioautographs, the 125I-labeled peptide accumulated focally at the healing edges of regenerating endothelial islands in the balloon-catheter deendothelialized rabbit aorta. In contrast, the 21-residue apoE-based peptide, which included residues 129-148 of apoE, accumulated diffusely and uniformly throughout the deendothelialized areas of the aorta. The data show that focal binding of the apoB-based peptide can delineate arterial lesions and suggest that this arterial wall-binding domain of apoB mediates accumulation of LDLs in arterial lesions.\r"

It is primarily based on the resistance of phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages to some restriction enzymes. A mismatch oligonucleotide is introduced into a gapped region and the gap is filled using three deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates and one deoxynucleoside 5'-[alpha-thio]triphosphate. Reaction with a restriction enzyme that is unable to hydrolyze phosphorothioates ensures that the DNA containing the mismatch oligonucleotide is only nicked. Concomitantly, the DNA that does not contain the desired mutation is linearized. Subsequent reactions with an exonuclease and DNA polymerase I yield mutant homoduplex DNA for transfection.\r"

After each dose, the cotransporter was investigated with respect to (i) Na(+)-dependent transport activity and (ii) immunologic blot analysis with antibodies against the cloned rabbit intestinal cotransporter. Increasing radiation decreased the maximal Na(+)-dependent cotransporter activity Jmax without affecting apparent Km. The size of the transporting functional unit was 290 +/- 5 kDa. Immunologic blot analysis of brush border membranes gave a single band of Mr 70,000, which decreased in intensity with increased radiation dose and gave a target size of 66 +/- 11 kDa.

  ".W": "In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. & Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. & Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.\r"

  ".W": "Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), which has a bound FMN, was isolated from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri strain Y-1b. Its presence in a luciferase [alkanal monooxygenase (FMN-linked); alkanal, reduced-FMN:oxygen oxidoreductase (1-hydroxylating, luminescing), EC 1.14.14.3] reaction mixture causes a striking color change, and an increase in bioluminescence intensity, as well as a faster rate of intensity decay, so that the quantum yield is not changed. The emission spectrum shows two distinct color bands, one at 490 nm attributed to the unaltered emission of the luciferase system, the other peaking in the yellow around 540 nm due to YFP emission. The kinetics of the two color bands differ, so the spectrum changes with time. The yellow emission reaches its initial maximum intensity later than the blue, and then both blue and yellow emissions decay exponentially with nearly the same pseudo-first-order rate constants, linearly dependent on [YFP] (from 0.01 sec-1 with no YFP to a maximum of approximately 0.1 sec-1 at 4 degrees C) but exhibiting a saturation behavior. The data can be interpreted by assuming the interaction of YFP with the peroxyhemiacetal intermediate in the luciferase reaction to form an unstable new complex whose breakdown gives the yellow emitter in its excited state. This simple model fits well the data at [YFP] less than 15 microM. The results indicate that a single primary excited state cannot be responsible for the blue and the yellow emissions.\r"

Morphological fusion of the medial giant axon (MGA) of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris is defined as axoplasmic and axolemmal continuity in serial longitudinal sections of MGAs taken through the fusion site as viewed with light or electron microscopes. Morphological continuity is also shown by the transfer of Lucifer yellow dye between apposed MGA segments fused with PEG, but not between apposed MGA segments in normal or hypotonic saline without PEG application. PEG-induced MGA fusion rates can be as high as 80-100% with an appropriate choice of PEG concentration and molecular mass, tight apposition and careful alignment of the cut ends, and treatment with hypotonic salines containing reduced calcium and increased magnesium. A variant of this technique might produce rapid repair of severed mammalian-myelinated axons.\r"

Tumor cells producing TGF-beta, though retaining expression for class I major histocompatibility complex molecules and the tumor-specific antigen, did not stimulate primary CTL responses in vitro and were not effective in vivo for directly stimulating primary CTL or in priming for CTL responses. Furthermore, TGF-beta-producing tumors grew progressively in transiently immunosuppressed mice without losing the tumor antigen; thus, TGF-beta produced by tumors may promote escape from immune surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the possible role of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta), a cytokine that appears to be an important modulator of inflammation and tissue repair, in regulation of human plasma protein synthesis during the acute-phase response. In Hep 3B cells, TGF-beta led to increased secretion of the positive acute-phase proteins alpha 1-protease inhibitor and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and decreased secretion of the negative acute-phase protein albumin. In Hep G2 cells, after incubation with TGF-beta, the same changes in secretion of alpha 1-protease inhibitor, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and albumin were observed, as well as decreased secretion of both the negative acute-phase protein alpha-fetoprotein and the positive acute-phase protein fibrinogen. In addition, TGF-beta modulated the effects of interleukin 6; these cytokines, in combination, were additive in inducing synthesis and secretion of alpha 1-protease inhibitor and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and in decreasing secretion of albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. TGF-beta inhibited the induction of fibrinogen caused by interleukin 6. The effects on alpha 1-protease inhibitor were confirmed by metabolic labeling in Hep 3B cells and by demonstrating increased accumulation of specific mRNA in Hep G2 cells, and the effects on fibrinogen were confirmed in Hep 3B cells by studies of mRNA for the alpha chain of fibrinogen. TGF-beta had no effect on haptoglobin or alpha 1-acid glycoprotein secretion, either directly or in the presence of interleukin 6, which is capable of inducing these proteins. These studies demonstrate that TGF-beta can affect hepatic synthesis and secretion of a subset of acute-phase proteins, both directly and by modulating the effect of interleukin 6. The affected group of plasma proteins is distinct from those affected by other recognized acute-phase protein-inducing cytokines. These findings support the view that combinations of cytokines mediate the response of the hepatocyte to inflammatory stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Native Octopus dofleini hemocyanin appears as a hollow cylinder in the electron microscope. It is composed of 10 polypeptide subunits, each folded into seven globular oxygen-binding domains. The native structure reassociates spontaneously from subunits in the presence of Mg2+ ions. We have selectively removed the C-terminal domain and purified the resulting six-domain subunits. Although these six-domain subunits do not associate efficiently at pH 7.2, they undergo nearly complete reassociation at pH 8.0. The resulting molecule looks like the native cylindrical whole molecule but lacks the usual fivefold protrusions into the central cavity. Partially reassociated mixtures show dimers of the subunit that have a characteristic parallelogram shape when lying flat on the electron microscope grid, and a \"boat\" form in side view. Removal of the C-terminal domain from monomers results in the removal of two characteristically placed domains in the dimers. These observations allow the development of a model for the arrangement of the subunits within the whole molecule. The model predicts exactly the views seen in the electron microscope of both whole molecule and dimeric intermediates.\r"

  ".W": "The adrenergic receptors (ARs) (subtypes alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2) are a prototypic family of guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors that mediate the physiological effects of the hormone epinephrine and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. We have previously assigned the genes for beta 2- and alpha 2-AR to human chromosomes 5 and 10, respectively. By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we have now mapped the alpha 1-AR gene to chromosome 5q32----q34, the same position as beta 2-AR, and the beta 1-AR gene to chromosome 10q24----q26, the region where alpha 2-AR is located. In mouse, both alpha 2- and beta 1-AR genes were assigned to chromosome 19, and the alpha 1-AR locus was localized to chromosome 11. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis has shown that the alpha 1- and beta 2-AR genes in humans are within 300 kilobases (kb) and the distance between the alpha 2- and beta 1-AR genes is less than 225 kb. The proximity of these two pairs of AR genes and the sequence similarity that exists among all the ARs strongly suggest that they are evolutionarily related. Moreover, they likely arose from a common ancestral receptor gene and subsequently diverged through gene duplication and chromosomal duplication to perform their distinctive roles in mediating the physiological effects of catecholamines. The AR genes thus provide a paradigm for understanding the evolution of such structurally conserved yet functionally divergent families of receptor molecules.\r"

The initiation sites are situated within polypyrimidine tracts that are flanked by both upstream and intragenic promoter elements. In the TATA-box region of each rp promoter, there is a functionally critical element with nuclear factor binding specificity that is distinct from that of a conventional TATA box. To understand how the various elements contribute to rp promoter function, we have used site-specific mutagenesis-transfection protocols and factor binding analyses to evaluate the significance of the polypyrimidine initiator and the TATA-box counterpart for efficient and accurate transcription of the rpS16 gene. Our results indicate (i) that the polypyrimidine initiator sequence critically defines the position of the transcriptional start site, whereas a much less specific sequence is sufficient to satisfy the efficiency requirement; (ii) that an uninterrupted stretch of pyrimidines in the initiator region is not necessary for efficient transcription of rpS16 gene; and (iii) that the TATA-box counterpart or even a substituted conventional TATA box primarily influences promoter efficiency. The great diversity of promoter design, which is becoming evident as more RNA polymerase II promoters are being carefully dissected, suggests that the requirements for building a functional initiation complex may be much more flexible than was previously appreciated.\r"

In contrast, early mRNAs containing 5' poly(A) sequences have not previously been identified. Modifications to the sequence of the promoter of an early gene of cowpox virus enable this promoter to direct the synthesis of RNAs containing 5' poly(A) sequences. When the sequence 3'-ATTTA-5', which is present at the RNA start-sites of several late promoters, is positioned such that the RNA start-site of the early promoter is at the first thymidylate in this sequence, this early promoter directs the synthesis of early RNAs containing 4-11 adenylates at their 5' ends. When two of the thymidylates in the sequence 3'-ATTTA-5' are removed, the promoter directs the synthesis of early RNAs lacking 5' poly(A) sequences. These results are consistent with the proposal that 5' polyadenylylation of poxvirus RNAs occurs by repetitive transcription of thymidylates in the sequence 3'-ATTTA-5' often present at the sites of transcriptional initiation. In addition, these results demonstrate that 5' polyadenylylation of viral RNAs is not exclusively a late function. The promoter regions of a few early genes of vaccinia virus contain the sequence 3'-ATTTA-5'. Analyses of the transcripts of one of these genes, the D5 gene, indicated that these mRNAs contain 5' poly(A) sequences, suggesting that early mRNAs of a subset of viral genes contain 5' poly(A) sequences.\r"

This receptor mediates the cellular attachment to collagen and, subsequently, the glandular differentiation seen in a three-dimensional collagen gel culture. In a search to identify cell surface molecules mediating the adhesion and differentiation of SW1222 cells, we have screened a panel of monoclonal antibodies recognizing epithelial cell surface determinants for their ability to inhibit the collagen binding of SW1222 cells. We have found that four monoclonal antibodies recognizing the 180-kDa carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) glycoprotein and other members of the CEA family inhibited (up to 87%) the binding of SW1222 cells to type I collagen matrix. Using a cell attachment assay, we have not detected any direct collagen binding of either purified CEA or another CEA-expressing human colon carcinoma cell line (LS174T). These data suggest that CEA is not a collagen-binding protein itself but is likely to be associated with the functional Arg-Gly-Asp collagen receptor expressed by SW1222 cells. We suggest that CEA may function as an accessory molecule, controlling the functional activity of the SW1222 collagen receptor.\r"

This control protein limits the enzymic activity of the first component of complement and of other plasma serine proteases. Sequence comparisons of a 4.6-kilobase-long segment of the normal gene and the corresponding gene segments isolated from two patients carrying family-specific DNA deletions point to unusually long clusters of tandem repeats of the Alu sequence family as a source of genetic instability in this locus. Unequal crossovers, in a variety of registers, among Alu sequences of the clusters result in deletions of variable length that encompass exon 4. In a third family, exon 4 was instead found to be duplicated along with the same tracts of flanking introns lost in one of the deletions. In addition to undergoing Alu-mediated partial deletions and duplications, the gene is also a target for more recent retroposition events. Gross alterations in the C1 inhibitor gene account for about 20% of the hereditary angioedema chromosomes and consequently make this gene a prime example of the mutagenic liability of Alu repeats.\r"

A system to study in a single round of replication the products of virions with two different genomic RNAs was established. A spleen necrosis virus-based splicing vector containing both the neomycin-resistance gene (neo) and the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hygro) was used. Two frameshift mutants were derived from this vector such that the neo and the hygro genes were inactivated in separate vectors. Thus, each vector confers resistance to only one selection. The vectors with frameshift mutations were separately propagated and were pooled to infect DSDh helper cells. Doubly resistant cell clones were isolated, and viruses produced from these clones were used to infect D17 cells. This protocol allowed virions containing two different genomic RNAs (heterozygotes) to complete one round of retroviral replication. The molecular nature of progeny that conferred resistance to single or double selection and their ratio were determined. Our data demonstrate that each infectious heterozygous virion produces only one provirus. The rate of retroviral recombination is approximately 2% per kilobase per replication cycle. Recombinant proviruses are progeny of heterozygous virions.\r"

  ".W": "In the brains of aged humans and cases of Alzheimer disease, deposits of amyloid in senile plaques are located in proximity to nerve processes. The principal component of this extracellular amyloid is beta/A4, a peptide derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is actively expressed in brain and systemic organs. Mechanisms that result in the proteolysis of APP to form beta/A4, previously termed beta-amyloid protein, and the subsequent deposition of the peptide in brain are unknown. If beta/A4 in senile plaques is derived from neuronally synthesized APP and deposited at locations remote from sites of synthesis, then APP must be transported from neuronal cell bodies to distal nerve processes in proximity to deposits of amyloid. In this study, using several immunodetection methods, we demonstrate that APP is transported axonally in neurons of the rat peripheral nervous system. Moreover, our investigations show that APP is transported by means of the fast anterograde component. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a neuronal origin of beta/A4, in which amyloid is deposited in the brain parenchyma of aged individuals and cases of Alzheimer disease. In this setting, we suggest that APP is synthesized in neurons and delivered to dystrophic nerve endings, where subsequent alterations of local processing of APP result in deposits of brain amyloid.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of DNA damage and nucleotide excision repair in intrachromosomal homologous recombination, a plasmid containing duplicated copies of the gene coding for hygromycin resistance was introduced into the genome of a repair-proficient human cell line, KMST-6, and two repair-deficient lines, XP2OS(SV) from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A and XP2YO(SV) from complementation group F. Neither hygromycin-resistance gene codes for a functional enzyme because each contains an insertion/deletion mutation at a unique site, but recombination between the two defective genes can yield hygromycin-resistant cells. The rates of spontaneous recombination in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum cell strains containing the recombination substrate were found to be similar. The frequency of UV-induced recombination was determined for three of these cell strains. At low doses, the group A cell strain and the group F cell strain showed a significant increase in frequency of recombinants. The repair-proficient cell strain required 10- to 20-fold higher doses of UV to exhibit comparable increases in frequency of recombinants. These results suggest that unexcised DNA damage, rather than the excision repair process per se, stimulates such recombination.\r"

To study the early development of the murine central nervous system we have sought to isolate growth factor receptors from the neuroepithelium of the neural tube of 10-day-old mouse embryos. Because many growth factor receptors are members of the protein-tyrosine kinase family, we have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify mRNA sequences from 10-day-old mouse embryo neuroepithelium; these sequences lie between the nucleotide sequences of two highly conserved amino acid motifs from the catalytic domain of protein-tyrosine kinases. By using this technique we have isolated a clone encoding the murine basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (bFGF-R), as well as a shorter form of this mRNA. This latter cDNA comprised 75% of the bFGF-R cDNA clones isolated from the immortalized neuroepithelial cell lines. This variant mRNA, designated here as N-bFGF-R, appears to be expressed at higher levels in neuronal cells in early stages of development. The bFGF-R is a member of a multigene family, as demonstrated by Southern blot analysis and the cloning of two other members of this family.\r"

There is good agreement over the entire temperature range for the elastic, quasi-elastic, and inelastic components of the scattering. This provides support for the accuracy of the simulations of the internal motions that make the dominant contributions to the atomic displacements on a time scale of 0.3-100 ps (100-0.3 cm-1). Analysis of the simulations shows that at low temperatures a harmonic description of the molecule is appropriate and that the molecule is trapped in localized regions of conformational space. At higher temperatures the scattering arises from a combination of vibrations within wells (substates) and transitions between them; the latter contribute to the quasi-elastic scattering.\r"

Four to five days after training, terminal arborizations of B cells iontophoretically injected with Ni2+ ions and then treated with rubeanic acid were measured with charge-coupled device (CCD)-digitized pseudocolor images of optical sections under \"blind\" conditions.

  ".W": "The anti-human serum albumin (HSA) B-cell repertoire of C57BL/6 mice was examined by culturing splenocytes at limiting dilution following polyclonal stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and a lymphokine mixture. The frequency of anti-HSA precursors was determined before and after immunization with alum-precipitated HSA and 10(9) killed Bordetella pertussis organisms, by submitting clonal supernatants to an ELISA. Anti-HSA IgG1-forming precursors were rare in unimmunized spleens, representing approximately equal to 1 in 500,000 splenocytes or only approximately equal to 100 cells per spleen. Between day 5 and day 7 after immunization, this figure increased to approximately equal to 20,000 cells per spleen. Over the following 3 weeks, there was a progressive increase in the mean optical density generated in the clonal ELISA, presumably due to affinity maturation of the B-cell population. When freshly deaggregated HSA was injected before or even up to 4 days after challenge immunization, the appearance of anti-HSA IgG1-forming cell precursors was largely prevented. The effect was most marked with 5 mg or 1 mg of soluble HSA, but impressive partial effects could be seen with as little as 10 micrograms of HSA if administered before challenge immunization. Most of the few clones seen after the higher doses of the toleragen appeared to make antibody of low affinity. The capacity to influence the B-cell pool by soluble antigen administered just 1-2 days before the sudden appearance of IgG1 precursors argues against the totality of the effect being due to T-cell-mediated suppression and in favor of a direct effect on B cells.\r"

A critical target of superoxide may be nitric oxide (NO.) produced by endothelium, macrophages, neutrophils, and brain synaptosomes. Superoxide and NO. are known to rapidly react to form the stable peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-). We have shown that peroxynitrite has a pKa of 7.49 +/- 0.06 at 37 degrees C and rapidly decomposes once protonated with a half-life of 1.9 sec at pH 7.4. Peroxynitrite decomposition generates a strong oxidant with reactivity similar to hydroxyl radical, as assessed by the oxidation of deoxyribose or dimethyl sulfoxide. Product yields indicative of hydroxyl radical were 5.1 +/- 0.1% and 24.3 +/- 1.0%, respectively, of added peroxynitrite. Product formation was not affected by the metal chelator diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid, suggesting that iron was not required to catalyze oxidation. In contrast, desferrioxamine was a potent, competitive inhibitor of peroxynitrite-initiated oxidation because of a direct reaction between desferrioxamine and peroxynitrite rather than by iron chelation. We propose that superoxide dismutase may protect vascular tissue stimulated to produce superoxide and NO. under pathological conditions by preventing the formation of peroxynitrite.\r"

Although measurements are easily obtained with a tape measure, the validity of these measurements is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of determinations of leg-length differences (LLDs) obtained by use of a specified tape measure method (TMM). Leg-length differences using the TMM and a radiographic technique were determined for 10 subjects who were candidates for clinical leg-length measurements and for 9 healthy control subjects. Validity of the TMM measurements was determined by assessing the degree of agreement between TMM-obtained LLDs and those obtained by the radiographic method. Validity estimates as determined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were .770 for patients, .359 for healthy subjects, and .683 for all subjects. When the means of the two values obtained by use of the TMM were compared with the radiographic measurements, the ICCs were .852 for the patient group, .637 for the healthy subjects, and .793 for all subjects. This study suggests that TMM-derived LLD measurements are valid indicators of leg-length inequality and that the estimates of validity are improved by using the average of two determinations rather than a single determination.\r"

The task was to toss, by flexing the elbow, a Ping-Pong ball held in a cup on a forearm splint to a target. The biceps brachii muscle and the long and lateral heads of the triceps brachii muscle were monitored electromyographically to determine any changes occurring during skill acquisition. The Experimental Group's accuracy improved at a significantly greater rate than that of the Control Group. In addition, the Experimental Group demonstrated changes in timing variables that led to a more efficient movement. These changes included a decrease in time from the onset of muscle activity to peak activity and an increase in the time elapsed from the onset of agonist contraction to the onset of antagonist contraction. These results suggest that mental practice may be an important tool in facilitating the acquisition of a new motor skill.\r"

In this article, the well-documented properties of the healthy adult's myotatic reflex are compared with recent findings of the myotatic reflex in healthy infants and children and contrasted with reflex properties in patients with cerebral palsy. These data allow us to begin to characterize the emerging features of the stretch reflex in normal and pathological early development. From these data, we can begin to speculate about the relationship between changes in stretch reflexes and the acquisition of skillful movement and gait in early childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Contemporary surgery to rejuvenate the aging neck commonly includes some type of platysma modification. Most currently used methods of platysmaplasty involve upper midline plication, muscle resection, or transection. These methods, however, have their shortcomings, often producing necks that display persistent or recurrent paramedian muscle bands, visible submandibular gland bulges, and various contour irregularities. Corset platysmaplasty was developed to avoid these postoperative imperfections. After an adequate subcutaneous and subplatysmal lipectomy has been performed, the two medial edges of the platysma are joined together with a continuous suture that runs down, and up, and down almost the full-height of the neck to create a smooth, flat, multilayered seam, leaving no free muscle edges to return as visible bands. Progressive side-to-side tightening along the midline seam defines the \"waistline\" of the neck. Additional submandibular suturing is then done to create strong, flat, vertical muscle pleats that correct submandibular gland bulging and refine the jawline and anterolateral neck contours. Corset platysmaplasty is useful for all patients with visible paramedian muscle bands and all patients who would benefit from having a decussated upper neck platysma opened for submuscular defatting, including patients with oblique, palpably firm necks that suggest a vertically short platysma muscle or low-lying hyoid bone. The paper is based on the results with 75 patients having undergone corset platysmaplasty, most having been followed for 1 to 3 years.\r"

However, definitive cosmetic correction was not achieved, and early cranial surgery was not able to prevent the development of midface hypoplasia. Thirty-two midfacial advancements have been performed in 30 patients. Sixteen patients had sufficient follow-up data for more than 2 years postoperatively. In all patients, a satisfactory early postoperative result was achieved. In the long-term follow-up group, 11 patients have maintained a satisfactory appearance, while 5 have developed recurrent deformity. Analysis shows this to be associated with a younger age at operation and continued mandibular growth. Frontofacial advancement in adults achieves good long-term results but is associated with a higher incidence of complications.\r"

The occlusal disturbance may consist of either crossbite, open bite, maxillary rotation, or lack of proper dental intercuspation. On CT scan, fractures are best demonstrated in the posterior and medial maxillary walls at the Le Fort I level; they are most obvious unilaterally with contralateral fractures that may be subtle. Bilateral maxillary sinus fluid is consistently present on CT.

Various approaches to the problem have been entertained, and a lessening of the incidence has occurred as reviewed in our earlier report, which follows augmentation mammaplasty in our clinic from 1962 through 1979. In this retrospective study, no significant difference in contracture rate was seen based on patient smoking habits, operative approach used, or implant type. It is important to note that the total experience with the low-bleed implant was significantly lower in terms of number of patients meeting the criteria of this retrospective study than the standard gel mammary implant. Greater follow-up time and number of patients will be evaluated in future retrospective studies. We have demonstrated in this study that placement of the implant beneath the pectoral muscle has significantly diminished the incidence of capsular contracture both as Baker grades II, III, and IV and as Baker grades III and IV. The retropectoral site has become the preferred location for the prosthesis in our clinic. There is no appreciable alteration in the overall shape of the breasts from this approach, and therefore, it will continue to be the preferred method. Rates of incidence of hematoma, the most frequent adverse reaction after contracture, were not significantly different between the retropectoral and retromammary implant sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Capsular contracture was found by the surgeons in 50 percent of the gel implant group and in 16 percent of the saline implant group, which is in conformity with the results of the follow-up 5 years earlier. The incidence of deflation was 16 percent in the saline group and occurred in different sizes of both overinflated and underinflated prostheses. The degree of slow leakage from saline implants will be discussed. Despite the high rate of contractures in the gel group, 85 percent of all patients were satisfied with the result of the reconstruction.\r"

The results showed that significant numbers of adipocytes were ruptured after suction procedures. The intact cells represented approximately 10 percent of the fat cell population. Fat cells in aspirated and excised samples remained intact and did not differ histologically. After being injected into tissue, adipocytes appeared to survive better for a short term in a more vascularized bed (rectus muscle) than in a low vascular area (ear dermis). Long-term studies at 6- to 9-month intervals revealed transplanted adipose tissue, taken by suction or excision, being replaced with fibrosis, although cystic spaces and only a small number of surviving adipocytes were still present. Insulin did not show any protective effects on survival of the adipocytes during their transplantation.\r"

In patients with an absence of sensibility below the L3 spinal level, a locally transposed arterialized neuromyocutaneous gracilis flap may be uniquely utilized for ischial restoration of sensibility. Two patients with meningomyelocele-induced ischial pressure sores underwent local innervated neuromyocutaneous gracilis flap transposition to insensate areas from below the anatomic level of recipient insensibility. A 10-year follow-up revealed maintenance of sensibility in the flap and spread of sensibility to adjacent insensate areas with no evidence of pressure sore recurrence. Cadaver dissection and clinical Xylocaine injection demonstrated that the cutaneous sensory innervation to this flap is by means of a consistent sensory branch from the deep neurovascular pedicle, which coincides with the L1-L3 dermatome.\r"

Studies were done in 80 Sprague-Dawley rats and in cadaveric hands. Angioscopic findings were correlated with gross and histologic inspection and found to be 100 percent accurate. We conclude that microvascular angioscopy can provide important information concerning the integrity of vessels less than 1 mm in diameter with excellent optical resolution and with minimal time expenditure.\r"

  ".U": "90160886\r", 
  ".W": "The use of microvascular tissue transfer as an adjunct to arterial reconstruction has begun to have a positive impact on limb salvage in patients with advanced arteriosclerosis and nonhealing ischemic wounds. However, many patients with severe peripheral vascular insufficiency not amenable to conventional arterial reconstructive procedures eventually require limb amputation. We have treated 12 patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease and nonhealing ischemic wounds by three different methods. These included distal bypass alone, distal bypass done in conjunction with free-tissue transfer, and free-tissue transfer alone. All bypass grafts were done to vessels at or below the ankle using a reversed saphenous vein. In each case, the distal anastomosis was performed, using the operating microscope and standard microvascular technique. Mean follow-up for these patients is 18 months. Distal bypass alone resulted in limb salvage in three of five patients. In the combined bypass and free-flap group, three of five patients had salvage of their threatened extremity at a 1-year follow-up. Two patients with ischemic ulcers, rest pain, and unsuitable distal vessels for bypass were treated with free-tissue transfer alone. This resulted in healed wounds, limb salvage, and complete resolution of the rest pain symptoms in both patients. When advanced ischemia is complicated by large areas of tissue loss, combined bypass and microvascular free-issue transfer, performed in stages or simultaneously, is safe and can often result in limb salvage. In the rare instance of a completely obliterated distal runoff bed, free-tissue transfer alone may provide not only a healed wound, but also a means of \"indirect\" revascularization of the extremity and limb salvage.\r"

In the present study, 15 patients had gaps of 0.5 to 3.0 cm (mean 1.7 cm) in digital nerves reconstructed by one surgeon with a bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) tube. A final evaluation of sensibility was done by a second surgeon at a mean postoperative interval of 22.4 months (range 11 to 32 months). These were all secondary reconstructions. The evaluation included a digital nerve block with local anesthetic for the intact (not reconstructed) digital nerve. Excellent functional sensation (moving two-point discrimination less than or equal to 3 mm and/or static two-point discrimination less than or equal to 6 mm) was present in 33 percent and good functional sensation (moving two-point discrimination of 4 to 7 mm and/or static two-point discrimination of 7 to 15 mm) in 53 percent of the digital nerve reconstructions. One patient with poor sensory recovery and one with no recovery were judged as functional failures (14 percent). Absence of pain at the site of reconstruction was judged by the patient to be excellent in 40 percent, good in 33 percent, and poor in 27 percent. We conclude that reconstruction of nerve gaps of up to 3.0 cm with a bioabsorbable PGA tube gives clinical results at least comparable to the classic nerve graft technique while avoiding donor-site morbidity.\r"

The blunt technique allows for a multiplicity of small (4 to 6 mm) channels to be created and the fat removed by suction with little disturbance of the overlying skin, the supporting septa, vessels, or nerves. Abdominolipectomy has been successfully performed for decades, in which large amounts of skin and subcutaneous fat are removed by sharp dissection. The undermining involved in an adbominolipectomy extending from the xiphoid to pubis and laterally to the level of the iliac crest and then supplemented by the suction technique has led to the formation, in some cases, of chronic seromas not relieved by multiple aspirations. Healing and contractions of these seromas causes a deformity of the overlying skin, because it is puckered and drawn upon itself. This results in the formation of a subcutaneous pseudobursa lined by collagen sheets but no epithelial cells. We present 9 patients who have demonstrated this phenomenon. We suggest that in the largest resections, safety is best served by waiting a period of at least 6 weeks between suction and subsequent resection.\r"

In the remaining two patients, a narrow horizontal lip defect was repaired by bilateral vermilion flaps and a subcutaneous V-Y advancement flap of the lower lip. A single vermilion flap or bilateral vermilion flaps are considered to be of great value for vermilion reconstruction because of the inherent elasticity and common anatomic unit. The postoperative scars are not remarkable at all. A long and narrow horizontal lip defect (perhaps within 1.5 cm downward from the vermilion border) may be effectively repaired by the combination of vermilion flap(s) and a V-Y advancement flap without sacrificing any additional healthy tissue.\r"

In these four responding cases there was a transient increase in transaminase levels during treatment and in two, this was followed by improvement. One patient also cleared HBV and seroconverted to anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen--HBsAg). In one patient with sustained loss of HDV, recurrence of HDV infection was detected 18 months after completion of treatment. These data suggest that alpha-interferon can inhibit HDV replication in the short term but relapse after one to two years may occur. Inhibition of HDV-RNA is associated with improvement in the inflammatory liver disease and now larger studies are required to determine whether it influences survival.\r"

The reduction in cell yields by pretreatment with corticosteroid was very variable. In 16 of 32 cases, cortical, medullary and total cell numbers were all greatly reduced ('depleted cases'), whereas in the others, they were within or near the typical range for untreated myasthenics. Cortical thymocytes were even more depleted than precursor thymic blasts. Thus the interpatient differences in sensitivity to corticosteroid recently described for mature T cells also affected immature cortical thymocytes and their differentiating medullary progeny. In the medulla, mature (CD3+) T lymphocytes and germinal centres were enriched by the loss of cortex and appeared relatively healthy, but somewhat depopulated. Concomitantly, in-vitro T-cell responses to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and production of anti-AChR antibody and total IgG by thymic cells were usually well within the typical range (assessed per 10(6) cells). Moreover, the total productivity of the entire thymus was reduced almost entirely by the cellular depopulation rather than by decreased function per surviving cell. Thus the main actions of this alternate day therapy with corticosteroids were apparently on total peripheral cell numbers, and perhaps on activated cells and effector mechanisms too, and its thymic effects were inessential.\r"

However, according to these strict cytologic criteria, only 46% of aspirates contained representative material. Based on less stringent cytologic criteria, the maximum sensitivity was 68% and the specificity was 97%. Forty-one of 74 lesions proved to be malignant at biopsy. Thirty-four patients did not complete adequate mammographic follow-up. High sensitivity and specificity can be achieved with X-FNA.

  ".W": "This prospective study correlated the results of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, arthrography, and arthroscopy in 27 patients with clinically suspected temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. Open surgical confirmation was available in 12 TMJs. The variables assessed with each modality were disk position and morphology, disk perforation, joint adhesions, and degenerative joint disease. MR imaging was superior to dual joint arthrography with arthrotomography in delineation of the disk position. MR imaging accurately demonstrated the disk position in 11 joints (92%); arthrography was accurate in nine of the 12 joints (75%) with surgically confirmed dysfunction. Disk perforations and joint adhesions were not demonstrated with MR imaging. Arthroscopy was superior to arthrography and MR imaging in the detection of disk perforations, joint adhesions, and early degenerative changes along the articular eminence and glenoid fossa. The authors believe MR imaging should constitute the first line of imaging because it provides accurate information about disk position in a noninvasive manner. In most cases, information obtained with MR imaging is adequate in deciding whether to institute conservative or surgical management; in difficult cases, triple correlation may be needed.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-nine patients who underwent radiation therapy with curative intent for laryngeal cancer were examined before treatment with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, between November 1985 and January 1987. MR findings of cartilage invasion were correlated with the effectiveness of radiation treatment. Adequate interpretation of the MR examinations was not possible in four cases (10%). Cartilage invasion was found in 16 of the 35 remaining patients and was found even in small glottic lesions, clinically staged as T1b and T2. Laryngeal cancer recurred in 10 of the 16 patients with cartilage invasion shown by MR imaging. The presence of even small foci of invasion of the thyroid cartilage by laryngeal cancer appeared to increase the subsequent risk of tumor recurrence. Cartilage invasion seen at MR imaging might therefore shift the preference to partial laryngectomy as the initial treatment for small glottic tumors. Alternatively, radiation therapy alone would appear to require stringent follow-up to detect possible recurrence.\r"

The group was carefully selected so as not to include persons with signs of arteriosclerotic diseases, major somatic disease, or a history of brain disease or dementia in the family. The width of the subarachnoid spaces and lateral ventricles, as well as the frequency and degree of brain white-matter lesions, were described with the use of a visual rating scale. White matter lesions were found in less than 9% of the subjects. The lateral brain ventricles were enlarged in 8% of all individuals and the cortical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces in more than 40% of all individuals. Moreover, T1 and T2 were estimated in different brain areas, and a positive correlation between T1 in the frontal white matter and age was found. A computer-assisted classification procedure was used to estimate brain tissue and CSF areas. The results of this procedure strongly correlated with the visually estimated ventricular size.\r"

In patients younger than 12 years old, no pituitary gland was found to be more than 6 mm in height. In adolescents, definite evidence for physiologic (pubertal) pituitary hypertrophy was seen in both sexes, although it was much more prominent in girls. The pituitary glands of four of 32 teenage girls measured 8-10 mm, but no teenage boy had a gland taller than 7 mm. Young adults aged 21-30 years had significantly (P less than .05) smaller glands than teenagers of the same sex. Significant (P = .0001) variations in the shape of the pituitary glands according to patient age and sex were also noted. Convex upper margins were seen in 56% of teenage girls, while this shape was noted in only 18% of the remaining patients of either sex. In eight of 32 teenage girls (25%) the pituitary glands were nearly spherical on sagittal images; this shape was not recorded in any other group. The normal maturation sequence of the pituitary gland apparently involves a period of physiologic hypertrophy in teenagers. This is manifest in girls by a significant change in both pituitary size and shape, while the glands of boys undergo a transformation in size only.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms by means of interventional neurovascular techniques is now being performed with a newly developed silicone detachable-microballoon device. The balloon is composed of unique silicone elastomers that are extremely soft and malleable. It therefore conforms to the blood vessel lumen or aneurysm wall and reduces the risk of rupture. It is affixed onto a 2.0-F catheter and can be either directed by flow or guided with the catheter. For aneurysms with a well-defined neck, the balloon is placed directly into the aneurysm, inflated with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate for permanent solidification, and detached. The aneurysm is thus excluded from the circulation, and the parent vessel is preserved. For aneurysms without a well-defined neck, test occlusion can be performed, followed by permanent balloon occlusion of the parent vessel. This balloon technique has been successfully used to treat aneurysms in both the anterior and posterior circulations, where standard neurosurgical techniques have failed, and in surgically inaccessible anatomic locations.\r"

OPCA may be associated with degeneration of other systems in multisystem atrophy (MSA). The authors report 23 cases of OPCA, eight of which were associated with MSA. Atrophy involved the cerebellum, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncles in all cases. On intermediate and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, abnormal signal intensity was always observed in the transverse pontine fibers, middle cerebellar peduncles, and cerebellum, structures known from pathologic study to degenerate in OPCA. Pyramidal tracts and superior cerebellar peduncles stood out because of their normal signal intensity. Of the eight patients with MSA, four also had variable abnormal signal intensities in the putamen. The authors believe that the combination of atrophy and abnormal signal intensity in the appropriate distribution strongly supports the diagnosis of OPCA. In some cases, MR imaging may demonstrate involvement of different systems, thus confirming the diagnosis of MSA.\r"

Two patients demonstrated P carinii within necrotizing, thin-walled, smaller intraparenchymal cavities lined by organisms, exudate, and chronic inflammation. Larger, typically apical and subpleural cysts, lined by fibrosis and/or alveolar parenchyma with little inflammation, were also found during acute episodes. The larger subpleural cysts can arise via rupture of intraparenchymal necrotizing cavities into the subpleural area. Pneumothorax in the four patients with AIDS could not be cured by close thoracostomy drainage; all required pleurodesis. The cysts persisted in cases that were followed up. All cysts were more obvious and numerous with computed tomography (CT), especially with 1.5-mm collimation. CT may be indicated in immunocompromised patients with unexplained pneumothorax or when tube thoracostomy has failed and surgery is being considered, as it can positively influence the operative approach.\r"

With extended survival, patients now experience diverse cardiopulmonary abnormalities that represent primary or secondary manifestations of the disease or that result from diagnosis and treatment. To evaluate these abnormalities, the authors reviewed the medical histories and chest radiologic findings of 19 patients with the histologic diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis. In these patients thoracic images demonstrated parenchymal nodules or consolidations with cavitation, diffuse interstitial disease, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy, and isolated stenoses of the larynx or tracheobronchial tree. Intrathoracic relapse occurred in 18 cases; in one-third of these patients, findings at relapse differed from those at initial presentation. Complications from diagnosis or therapy occurred in nine patients. Pulmonary infection was the most frequent complication causing morbidity and was often clinically indistinguishable from the primary disease; it complicated relapse in five patients. The successful radiologic follow-up of patients with Wegener granulomatosis requires a consideration of the varied thoracic manifestations of both the primary disease and the complications of its treatment.\r"

Chest radiographs obtained within 24 hours of cardiac catheterization were assessed for evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) by three experienced radiologists. Findings were graded from 0 to 3 (normal to abnormal) on the basis of the following signs of CHF: redistribution, perihilar and perivascular haze, peribronchial cuffing, pulmonary artery-bronchus ratio, septal lines, subpleural edema, air-space edema, pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and overall radiographic assessment of CHF. A consensus report was then generated. In patients with LVEDP over 20 mm Hg, 38% did not show CHF in the overall assessment. Correlation between radiographic signs of CHF and LVEDP was limited.\r"

In 55 renal arteries among 25 patients, MR angiography had a sensitivity of 100% for detecting renal artery stenosis of 50% or greater and a specificity of 92%. With MR angiography, the degree of renal artery stenosis was overgraded in four of 55 renal arteries: Mild stenosis was overgraded as moderate stenosis in two arteries and as a severe stenosis in one, and a moderate stenosis was overgraded as a severe stenosis in one. The number of renal arteries was correctly determined in all cases. The renal arteries could be well evaluated only in the proximal third of the vessel, precluding detection of more distal stenoses. Atherosclerotic plaque uniformly appeared dark on gradient-echo images and was easily differentiated from bright, flowing blood in the aortic lumen. MR angiography enabled correct grading of the presence of atherosclerotic plaque and stenoses of the abdominal aorta in 22 of 25 patients (88%). The authors conclude that MR angiography has the potential to be a useful screening technique for patients with suspected renal artery stenosis and disorders of the abdominal aorta, but further clinical studies are warranted.\r"

TAE was followed by a significant decrease in the platelet count (P less than .001); a prolongation of prothrombin time (P less than .001); an early increase in levels of fibrinopeptide A (P less than .01), fibrinopeptide B beta-15-42 (P less than .001), and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (P less than .001); and a delayed increase in the fibrinogen level (P less than .001), without a significant prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time. In the three patients who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after TAE, a reduction of both the platelet count and fibrinogen level occurred significantly earlier and in a more severe form than in the other patients without DIC; this reduction preceded the onset of the characteristic symptoms of DIC. Data suggested that close monitoring of platelet count and fibrinogen level is important for early detection of DIC following TAE.\r"

Complications included a puncture-site pseudoaneurysm following iliac artery angioplasty and transient hypertension that necessitated hospitalization in a renal artery angioplasty patient. One other patient was to undergo angiography and renal angioplasty if possible. The patient was admitted for surgical revascularization following angiography and an unsuccessful attempt at crossing a severe renal artery stenosis. This stenosis could not be crossed at the time, and this patient was admitted for surgical revascularization. The angioplasty sites included lesions within the abdominal aorta and the renal, iliac, superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal, celiac, and superior mesenteric arteries.

Each image was acquired throughout a small fraction of the cardiac cycle. The method was applied in an isolated perfused rat heart model (acquisition time = 116 msec) and in human subjects without known cardiac disease (acquisition time = 125 msec). Fast, high-resolution images (128 X 128 matrix) were created by combining sequentially acquired small matrixes. After bolus administration of Gd-DTPA in the perfused rat heart model, contrast was pronounced between the nonperfused myocardium and perfused normal myocardium. First-pass wash-in and washout phases of the contrast material were observed in the perfused rat heart model and in human subjects. Results demonstrated the clinical feasibility of first-pass perfusion studies of the heart. The studies can be performed on a conventional whole-body imaging system with standard hardware.\r"

Two reviewers analyzed the studies in a blinded fashion to determine interobserver and interstudy variability of measurements of left ventricular (LV) mass, volume, ejection fraction, and systolic wall stress. LV mass showed good reproducibility between studies, with 3.6% and 3.8% variability for LV end-systolic mass for the two observers. LV end-diastolic volume varied by 5.2% and 3.9%, and LV end-systolic volume, by 9.7% and 0.9%. Variability for LV ejection fraction was 5.0% and 4.9%. The largest interstudy variability was end-systolic wall stress, 11.1% and 13.5%, which was due mostly to changes in arterial pressure between the two studies. It is concluded that anatomic and functional measurements from cine MR images are reproducible between studies. The small interstudy variability is likely related to the fact the measurements are derived directly from cine MR images that encompass the entire heart rather than depend on measurements of only sample images and the use of geometric models.\r"

The authors performed a multiobserver study to determine the performance of radiologists reading posteroanterior conventional radiographs, digitized radiographs laser printed onto film, and images displayed on a high-resolution workstation (video monitor). A total of 300 images were evaluated by seven radiologists who recorded their ordinal confidence rating of the presence or absence of one or more of the following abnormalities: interstitial disease, nodule, and pneumothorax. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed statistically significant differences for the detection of different abnormalities by individual readers. The group as a whole showed a significant reduction in observer performance for the detection of interstitial disease and pneumothorax when the laser-printed radiographs or the workstation was used rather than conventional radiographs.\r"

Of 122 gallstones, 113 (93%) could be fragmented with 1-46 pulses from a 3-F electrode (average, 10 pulses). Only 12 of the 113 stones could be fragmented with a single spark. Of the nine stones that did not fragment with 50 pulses from a 3-F electrode, four were larger than 30 mm in diameter, and five were seen at radiography to be heavily calcified; all of these stones were fragmented with five or fewer pulses from a 9-F electrode. Stone capture in a wire basket facilitated fragmentation of gallstones of all sizes, but particularly those stones 15 mm or larger. Contact EHL could be performed as well in a 1:1 dilute diatrizoate irrigating solution as in 1:6 normal saline. A significantly greater number of pulses was required to fragment gallstones 15 mm in diameter or larger compared with stones smaller than 15 mm (P less than .01). In addition, stones 15 mm or smaller had a greater tendency to fragment into \"gravel\" (ie, fragments measuring 2 mm or less), while EHL of stones larger than 15 mm produced larger, discrete fragments of approximately equal size (P less than .05). EHL of heavily calcified gallstones required a significantly greater number of pulses than EHL of less calcified or noncalcified stones (P less than .002).\r"

Three patients had compensated cirrhosis, and four had active hepatitis. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo magnetic resonance images were obtained before and 1 hour after the administration of iron oxide. Eight patients without diffuse liver disease served as a control group. Normal liver tissue showed a 75% +/- 9% reduction in signal intensity after the administration of iron oxide, and the liver appeared homogeneously hypointense. Cirrhotic liver tissue showed a smaller response (P less than .05) to iron oxide, with a 52% +/- 13% reduction in liver signal intensity. Inhomogeneous structures could be observed in enhanced images and are thought to represent fibrous bands or regenerating nodules. Liver tissue with active hepatitis showed a markedly reduced response to iron oxide (11% +/- 2%) (P less than .05), and the parenchyma appeared homogeneous. The authors conclude that the uptake of iron oxide particles is inhomogeneously altered in cirrhosis because of structural changes and homogeneously decreased in hepatitis because of functional changes of hepatic parenchyma.\r"

Eight subjects younger than 16 years of age underwent abdominal US and MR imaging only. Scrotal US was employed in 25 male patients. Eleven subjects had renal cysts or tumors. Contrast-enhanced CT depicted renal abnormalities in 10 of these subjects, US in seven, and MR imaging in nine. Among 12 subjects with pancreatic cysts or tumors, CT showed pancreatic abnormalities in all 12, US in nine, and MR imaging in nine. Three subjects (mean age, 34.5 years) had renal tumors, and three had pancreatic masses. Scrotal US revealed epididymal cystadenomas in seven subjects; two of these tumors were surgically verified. A combination of contrast-enhanced CT and scrotal US in male patients appears to be the best way to screen for visceral manifestations of VHL disease.\r"

These included 20 patients with normal cervices, 11 with cervical incompetence of traumatic or congenital origin, and 10 with clinically small cervices due to in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. On MR images of the normal patients, cervical length was 33.0 mm +/- 1.0 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and the width of the internal cervical os was 3.3 mm +/- 0.1. In patients with cervical incompetence, the cervical length did not significantly differ from those in the normal group. However, the internal cervical os was significantly wider (4.5 mm +/- 0.3, P less than .001), and localized irregularity of the endocervical canal was demonstrated in two patients. The MR appearance of the cervical stroma varied from normal, uniformly low signal intensity (n = 4) to uniformly (n = 3) or partially (n = 4) medium-to-high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In the patients with in utero DES exposure, the mean length of the cervical canal (22.9 mm +/- 1.7) was significantly shorter than that of the normal group. The width of the internal cervical os and the MR signal intensity of the cervical stroma were normal. In summary, MR findings of a cervical length shorter than 3.1 mm (95% confidence limit), an internal cervical os wider than 4.2 mm (95% confidence limit), or abnormal signal intensity in the cervical stroma are highly suggestive of incompetent cervix and should assist in planning further therapeutic decisions.\r"

Descent (prolapse) of the bladder (bladder neck below the upper margin of the pubic symphysis) was present in 30 (46.2%) patients. Prolapse was both more frequent and tended to be more severe in girls. Complete LMN denervation of the urethral sphincter was present in 25 (83.3%) of the 30 patients with prolapse and in only four (11.4%) of 35 with a normally positioned bladder. Conversely, 25 (86.2%) of the 29 patients with complete LMN denervation of the sphincter had prolapse as compared with only five (13.9%) of 36 patients with partial or no LMN denervation of the sphincter. Although not as precise as urodynamic testing, significant descent of the bladder neck is a reliable urographic finding of complete LMN denervation of the external urethral sphincter in infants and children with myelodysplasia.\r"

All eight patients were treated with combined local hyperthermia and fractionated radiation therapy, followed by surgical resection of the tumor. Each patient underwent T2 measurements and five patients underwent MR spectroscopy (phase encoded in one dimension) before treatment, after the first hyperthermia treatment, at the end of the therapy course, and just before surgery. Catheter thermometry was performed at each hyperthermia treatment. The T2 and MR spectroscopic variables were compared with thermometric data and the histologic findings from the complete surgical specimen. Changes in T2 correlated with histologic grade of tumor and thermometric data. The pretherapy tumor pH correlated positively, and changes during therapy in pH, ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (Pi), ratio of nucleoside triphosphate to Pi, and the phosphomonoester signal-to-noise ratio correlated negatively, with the percentage of tumor necrosis on the surgical specimen. These preliminary data suggest MR imaging and MR spectroscopy may be useful in the evaluation of such patients before and during therapy.\r"

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of 10 normal extremities in five patients was performed with spin-echo (SE) and GRE sequences. The latter were obtained with gradient recalled acquisition in a steady state. SE and GRE sequences had identical spacing and planes of imaging. Cortical bone appeared as a signal void regardless of the pulse sequences and parameters. Marrow in contact with trabecular bone exhibited a shortened effective transverse relaxation time (T2*) and resultant signal loss because of local field inhomogeneities where mineralized matrix interfaced with it. This T2* effect was increased in regions with more trabecular bone (epiphysis) than regions with little trabecular bone (diaphysis). A low signal intensity on GRE images may represent fatty marrow with a high content of trabecular bone and should not be interpreted only as hematopoietic marrow.\r"

Clinical results were based on the Harris hip score. All acetabular components fared well. Three of the femoral stem components needed revision. The radiographic finding that correlated best with outcome was subsidence of more than 10 mm, especially if it continued to increase more than 1 year after surgery. Other findings related to failure were loosely placed femoral stems and the presence of loose beads. However, subsidence was such a powerful predictor of clinical outcome, and the other features were so weak, that combinations of variables did not improve the assessment of outcome. Close attention should be paid to subsidence in follow-up studies.\r"

The conventional and digitized images were evaluated by 10 radiologists, who gave their decision confidence on a graded scale.

A pixel size greater than 0.16 mm (2.88 1p/mm) resulted in a significant loss of diagnostic accuracy in comparison with conventional radiographs. Specific fractures in which a larger pixel size adversely affected the evaluation included torus injuries, corner fractures in child abuse, minimal avulsion injuries, and fractures that demonstrated only trabecular disruption.\r"

The authors show that it is possible to analyze free-response data in more general ways. The first method, AFROC analysis, involves scoring FROC images in a different way. The second method involves a new observer-performance experiment, the free-response forced error (FFE) experiment. FROC and AFROC analysis was applied to several FROC data sets, and simultaneous FROC-AFROC-FFE experiments were performed with several radiologist observers to test the three methods. The methods were found to be in good agreement with one another.\r"

To be selected, patients had to (a) have remained in relatively good general condition for at least 4 months after their initial course of radiation therapy and (b) experience renewed deterioration of their neurologic condition. Initial treatment typically consisted of 3,000 cGy administered in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the whole brain. Reirradiation most commonly consisted of 2,500 cGy in 10 fractions. Twenty-two patients (42%) responded to reirradiation and improved by at least one level in their neurologic function status. Survival after second therapy averaged 5 months. The authors conclude that reirradiation of cerebral metastases should be considered for patients who remain in good general condition but who experience neurologic deterioration 4 or more months after satisfactory response to initial palliative cerebral radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have established the feasibility of combining tissue heat generated by radio-frequency (RF) current and mechanical pressure to manage problems of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) that are thought to cause postangioplasty restenosis (PARS). In the current in vitro study of normal and atherosclerotic human aortic layers (intima-media and media-adventitia) separated artificially, the purposes were to identify a dose-response relationship between the total RF energy delivered and the resultant weld strength between vascular tissues and to study the histologic correlates. Twenty-eight control and 100 experimental specimens were evaluated. The mean weld strength for all specimens with no RF current (at 0 J) was 4.1 g +/- 2.0; at 100 J, 5.9 g +/- 2.8; at 200 J, 28.5 g +/- 3.3; at 300 J, 50.0 g +/- 5.5; and at 500 J, 82.0 g +/- 8.2. Inspection of treated specimens revealed vascular molding (depression in the surface corresponding in dimensions to those of the electrode gap in the treatment chamber). Histologic examination revealed necrosis in the region underlying the electrode gap, a hypocellular fusion zone, indistinct boundaries between welded specimen parts, and transition zones to normal histologic characteristics at either end of each specimen. RF energy combined with mechanical pressure produces dose-dependent thermal welds in artificially dissected vascular tissues, molding of vascular tissue, and cellular destruction in the media. These findings may have clinical application in the management or prevention of all forms of PARS in humans and in the treatment of spontaneous aortic dissection.\r"

To determine if tetracycline enhances the photoablative effects of the ultraviolet xenon-fluorine excimer laser, the authors exposed four cadaveric aortic samples to tetracycline and four to only normal saline. Ninety-three sites in the samples were subjected to laser energy and analyzed with light microscopy for crater depth and width and for degree of thermal injury. Forty-three of the sites were histologically normal, and 50 were atherosclerotic. Crater depth did not differ significantly in atherosclerotic and normal sites not exposed to tetracycline. Atherosclerotic sites exposed to tetracycline showed significantly deeper craters compared with those in normal, exposed sites. The effects of tetracycline exposure and histologic characteristics (normal vs atherosclerotic) on crater width and thermal injury were independent and additive. When the excimer laser is used for treatment, tetracycline can definitely enhance atherosclerotic plaque ablation.\r"

Flip angle, repetition time (TR), and echo time (TE) were varied, and a contrast-to-noise ratio between trapped clots and flowing fluid (clot-flow contrast) was determined for each set of imaging parameters. Use of very low flip angles (less than or equal to 10 degrees) rendered MHb clots indistinguishable from flowing fluid. In general, DHb clots displayed greater clot-flow contrast than MHb clots regardless of flip angle. With increasing TE values, T2* effect was observed with MHb clots, and magnetic susceptibility artifacts increased. Overall, optimum clot-flow contrast for imaging of both DHb and MHb clots was achieved with a flip angle of 45 degrees-60 degrees, a TR of 50 msec, and the shortest TE possible. Using GRE parameters similar to the optimum parameters determined in vitro, the authors imaged four patients with nickel-titanium Simon filters and one dog with a titanium Greenfield filter. MR imaging was successful in demonstrating filter location, caval patency, and the presence and extent of intraluminal thrombus.\r"

This model permits cholangiographic visualization of the duct during laser application. Laser damage is limited by using contact probes and firing the laser while slowly pulling the probe proximally into the duct. Sixteen common bile duct laser burns were produced in 14 dogs. Power settings of 8-25 W were used. The tension of the contact probe along the duct wall, termed \"wall tension,\" was varied through intraoperative manipulation in order to mimic a variety of ductal geometries that might be encountered in clinical use. The authors produced duct damage ranging from a superficial burn to perforation. Power and wall tension were the most important factors in determining the depth and circumference of damage, and the use of 15 W or less did not perforate the duct.\r"

Ten of the 16 (62%) allografts (in four adults and six children) were replaced within 4 months of drainage: Nine were replaced because of biliary sepsis or abscess, and one was replaced because of the absence of biliary-enteric communication. Most of these patients had cholangiographic evidence of extensive bile duct necrosis. In two patients, retransplantation was avoided for longer than 2 years. One of these needed a new liver because of multiple central biliary strictures. Four patients have now lived for 30-44 months since initiation of drainage without needing new livers. Despite drainage, the outcome of most of these allografts has been poor. However, in some liver transplant recipients who have had hepatic artery thrombosis, biloma drainage can prolong allograft survival and prevent retransplantation.\r"

In the majority of patients, disease was localized to the cavernosal arteries. A previous series that involved older patients had demonstrated significant disease in the hypogastric and internal pudendal arteries. When controlled for trauma, the data revealed no significant difference (X2 test, P greater than .10) in the distribution of hemodynamically significant penile arterial disease. However, in patients who had sustained major pelvic trauma, the common penile artery was frequently hemodynamically compromised. There is a great deal of variation in the origin of the internal pudendal artery. An accessory pudendal artery was demonstrated in 7% of the patients. If a selective internal pudendal artery injection fails to demonstrate the penile arterial anatomy, a less selective injection should be performed. Bilateral injections should always be performed, as unilateral arterial disease was present in 15% of the patients.\r"

The SCVIR also has under study a proposal to develop a national data base that would act as a repository of information on invasive radiologic procedures. By voluntarily participating in the program, departments would receive feedback that periodically documents performance and compares it with national norms established by all participants in the program. If the data base is sufficiently detailed, distinct advantages of collaborative research could result. Data related to comparative technology assessment, cost-benefit analyses, and other derived information could then be made available to other physicians, the public, payers, and government agencies.

With the number of peripheral vascular interventions increasing every year, interventional radiologists should strive to maintain a strong position in the performance of these procedures in order to retain a significant share of referrals. The author suggests that the subspecialty of interventional radiology will be strengthened if dedicated, fully trained cardiovascular interventional radiologists are willing to be more involved in the admission and long-term care of patients. Increased cooperation among specialists, more involvement in development of instrumentation and techniques, and establishment of ethical marketing strategies are also suggested as effective measures for sustaining the subspecialty and improving patient care.\r"

In each patient, removal of the drainage catheter resulted in severe pulsatile hemorrhage from the parenchymal tract and allowed angiographic localization of the bleeding site. Temporary control of the hemorrhage was then obtained by inflating an angioplasty balloon within the tract. Transcatheter embolotherapy provided definitive control of bleeding in three patients. When initial angiographic evaluation for bleeding in patients with percutaneous biliary and nephrostomy catheters fails to depict a source, the study should be repeated immediately after removal of the drainage catheter. Because hemorrhage can be severe once tamponade is relieved, the drainage catheter should be withdrawn over a guide wire so that a tamponading catheter can be rapidly reinserted to control hemorrhage until more definitive therapy is undertaken.\r"

Two examiners reviewed all angiograms in a blinded fashion, initially as 104 separate studies for diagnostic adequacy (ie, the need for additional angiography) and then as 52 paired studies for direct comparison of the quality of arterial filling (ie, the best-appearing angiogram). The 60-mL studies were significantly better (P less than .001) in both categories when compared with both the 30- and the 120-mL studies. There was, however, no significant difference between the 60-mL studies with and without inflow occlusion. The authors conclude that the best screen-film lower-limb angiograms are obtained with large volumes (60 mL) of contrast material injected below the pelvic vessels (EIA).\r"

When PB was administered to the pig immediately after inoculation with E. coli P57, E. coli P155, ST alone, LT alone, or ST and LT, the percentages of inhibition of fluid accumulation were 76%, 80%, 56%, 97%, and 69%, respectively. However, in the rabbit and rat, PB failed to inhibit fluid accumulation when it was administered 5-60 minutes after inoculation of cholera or E. coli LT enterotoxins. In the rabbit the combination of BSS and the vehicle of PB was synergistic in preventing the fluid accumulation normally produced by cholera toxin. Finally, when PB or BSS was administered 30 minutes before intestinal inoculation with arachidonic acid in a rat model of inflammatory diarrhea, the percentages of inhibition of fluid accumulation ranged, in a dose-responsive fashion, from 16% to 113% for PB and from 25% to 111% for BSS.\r"

In the first group, 8 ounces of BSS was given on two successive days. In the second group, a standard oral intestinal lavage preparation (GoLYTELY) was used to clean the colon and then 8 ounces of BSS was given during a 4-hour period. There were no changes in total microbial counts or in counts of individual groups such as enteric bacteria, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, or Clostridium difficile. On day 2 the yeast counts rose 2.4 log10 colony-forming units/g in the group taking 16 ounces of BSS but did not increase in the group taking 8 ounces of BSS plus GoLYTELY. The counts returned to pretreatment levels by day 7. These results show that a 1- or 2-day course of BSS, even with an oral intestinal lavage preparation, did not have significant effects on the normal microbial populations in the fecal microflora.\r"

In addition, 300 anaerobes isolated from clinical samples at three Italian hospitals were tested for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics (aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, penicillin, and piperacillin). Imipenem and metronidazole proved to be the most active agents, with low and similar values for the 50% and 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). No microorganism showed resistance to these agents. After imipenem and metronidazole, clindamycin was the most effective agent tested.

We present two cases of bacteremia in neutropenic patients who had been empirically treated with ceftazidime and piperacillin plus amikacin. In the first case a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated; in the second case bacteremia was due to a mixture of Leptotrichia buccalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.

For the SGE test a spiral plater produces a drug concentration gradient equivalent to up to eight twofold dilutions in a single agar plate. Bacteria are streaked in radial lines across this gradient, and the drug concentration at the endpoint location where growth ceases can be calculated. Early results demonstrated the need to develop a standardized procedure, various technical improvements, and revised SGE formulas that correct for drug diffusion in calculating endpoint concentrations for tests on aerobes and anaerobes. The revised SGE method demonstrated an overall 90.7% agreement (within +/- 1 twofold dilution) of the minimal inhibitory concentrations with those determined by the SAD method tested in parallel for 161 strains of a wide variety of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and eight antimicrobial agents. The reproducibility, sensitivity, and significantly increased efficiency warrant further evaluation of the revised SGE method.\r"

Whether an offender was given probation or sentenced to prison for such crimes could be predicted with about 80 percent accuracy from a combination of variables that described defendant and crime characteristics and criminal justice processing. The addition of race to the prediction equation for a given crime type did not improve the accuracy of the prediction. In addition, there was no evidence that other factors related to imprisonment (for example, number of conviction counts, going to trial) masked a relation between race and imprisonment. Race also was not related to the length of prison term imposed.\r"

Contrary to predictions of recent theoretical analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy indicates that there is no major movement of cytochrome c residue Phe82 on binding to cytochrome b5. The greater resolution provided by 13C NMR spectroscopy permits detection of small perturbations in the environments of cytochrome c residues Ile75 and Ile85 on binding with cytochrome b5, a result that is in agreement with earlier model-building experiments. As individual cytochrome c lysyl residues are resolved in the 1H NMR spectrum of N-acetimidylated cytochrome c, the interaction of this modified protein with cytochrome b5 has been studied to evaluate the number of cytochrome c lysyl residues involved in binding to cytochrome b5. The results of this experiment indicate that at least six lysyl residues are involved, two more than predicted by static model building, which indicates that cytochrome c and cytochrome b5 form two or more structurally similar 1:1 complexes in solution.\r"

  ".W": "The earliest hominid from South Africa, Australopithecus africanus, is known from only six specimens in which accurate assessment of endocranial capacity and cranial venous outflow pattern can be obtained. This places a severe limit on a number of hypotheses concerning early hominid evolution, particularly those involving brain-body size relationships and adaptations of the circulatory system to evolving upright posture. Advances in high-resolution two- and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) now allow the inclusion of another important specimen to this list, MLD 37/38 from Makapansgat. A new computer imaging technique is described that \"reconstructs\" the missing portions of the endocranial cavity in order to determine endocranial capacity. In addition, CT evaluation allows assessment of cranial venous outflow pattern even in cases where the endocranial cavity is completely filled with stone matrix. Results show that endocranial capacity in this specimen is less than originally proposed and also support the view that gracile and robust australopithecines evolved different cranial venous outflow patterns in response to upright postures.\r"

Despite similar levels of membrane CD4 expression and HIV-1 125I-labeled gp 120 binding, a dramatic acceleration in the time course of HIV-1 infection was observed in PF-382x compared to its X-MuLV-negative counterpart (PF-382). Moreover, PF-382 cells coinfected by X-MuLV and HIV-1 generated a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles, enabling HIV-1 to productively infect a panel of CD4- human cells, including B lymphoid cells and purified normal peripheral blood CD4-/CD8+ T lymphocytes. Mixed viral phenotypes were also produced by human CD4+ T cells coinfected with an amphotropic MuLV-related retrovirus (A-MuLV) and HIV-1. These data show that endogenous MuLV acquired by human cells transplanted into mice can significantly interact with HIV-1, thereby inducing important alterations of HIV-1 biological properties.\r"

KATP channel inhibition leads to activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, whereas KATP channel activation leads to inhibition of GABA release. These channels may be involved in the response of the brain to hyper- and hypoglycemia (in diabetes) and ischemia or anoxia.\r"

The RIIA sodium channel alpha subunit cDNA alone is sufficient for stable expression of functional sodium channels with the expected kinetic and pharmacological properties in mammalian somatic cells.\r"

After a brief activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ spreads inwardly, and reaches the center of these spherical cells in about 300 milliseconds. Although the Ca2+ redistribution in the bulk of the cytosol could be accounted for with a radial diffusion model, local nonlinearities, suggesting either nonuniform Ca2+ entry or spatial buffering, could be seen. After electrical stimulation, Ca2+ signals in the nucleus were consistently larger and decayed more slowly than those in the cytosol. A similar behavior was observed when release of intracellular Ca2+ was induced by caffeine, suggesting that in both cases large responses originate from Ca2+ release sites near or within the nucleus. These results are consistent with an amplification mechanism involving Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release, which could be relevant to activity-dependent, Ca2(+)-regulated nuclear events.\r"

Species with missing (:CH-OH) or extra (H3) substituents can often be formed conveniently in the gas phase by neutralizing a beam of a more stable ionic counterpart (CH = O+H, H3+). Reionization of the neutral after approximately 10(-6) seconds tests its stability, whereas its unimolecular chemistry can be probed by preparing it with different amounts of internal energy. The resulting neutral products are reionized and mass analyzed. Isomers are then characterized by ion dissociation and a third mass-analysis step. Many unusual molecules have been characterized with this technique, which can also be used to probe complex unimolecular chemistry, such as that of cyclobutadiene and ethylene oxide.\r"

A transformed phenotype and anchorage-independent growth were observed at ligand concentrations that failed to elicit these responses in cells expressing wild-type receptors. These findings imply that activation of the protein tyrosine kinase activity at the cell membrane is sufficient for the growth-enhancing effects of EGF. Thus, downregulation can serve as an attenuation mechanism, without which transformation ensues.\r"

The gene encoding one of these cotolerogens maps to chromosome 12 and is linked to the endogenous provirus Mtv-9. These observations suggest that the I-E-mediated and minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen (Mls)-mediated deletions of alpha beta T cells from the repertoire are similar; both require the expression of a class II MHC glycoprotein and a second non-MHC gene product.\r"

A family of three closely related potassium channel genes (MK1, MK2, and MK3) that are encoded at distinct genomic loci has been isolated. Sequence analysis reveals that the coding region of each of these three genes exists as a single uninterrupted exon in the mouse genome. This organization precludes the generation of multiple forms of the protein by alternative RNA splicing, a mechanism known to characterize the Drosophila potassium channel genes Shaker and Shab. Thus, mammals may use a different strategy for generating diverse K+ channels by encoding related genes at multiple distinct genomic loci, each of which produces only a single protein.\r"

Random urine samples are also tested for glucose at each prenatal visit. In 500 consecutive pregnant women, random urine glucose screening values from each prenatal visit were compared with a serum glucose test done at 28 weeks' gestation after ingestion of a 50 gm glucose-containing beverage. Twenty-two patients (4.4%) subsequently were identified as having gestational diabetes. Eighty-five (17%) had some degree of glycosuria, and 19 (3.8%) had severe glycosuria. Only six (27%) of the 22 women with gestational diabetes had any glycosuria. As a screening test for gestational diabetes, glycosuria had a 27% sensitivity and a positive predictive value of only 7.1%. Severe glycosuria, although increased in women with gestational diabetes (P = .0071), occurred in only 18% of cases. Detection of severe glycosuria before 24 weeks' gestation is an indication to do earlier blood glucose screening. After blood glucose screening is done, routinely screening the urine for glycosuria at each prenatal visit does not appear to be clinically useful.\r"

Average lateral curve correction was significantly better with CDI than with the combination of the other systems (71.9% and 56.4%, respectively; P less than .01). Average rotational correction was studied using the methods of Mehta, and Nash and Moe; all patients having CDI showed a median rotational improvement of 30 degrees; 57% of the comparison group had minimal improvement (P less than .01). These results suggest that CDI may offer a significant alternative to the Harrington and Drummond spinal instrumentation systems in the surgical management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.\r"

  ".W": "Severity of injury, patient age and preexisting medical conditions, time from injury to treatment, and quality of care rendered are generally recognized as major determinants of outcome after trauma. In a retrospective review, we compared 456 elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 65 years) with traumatic injuries to 985 younger patients (age less than 65). We compared cause of injury, injury severity score (ISS), seven risk factors indicating preexisting disease, complications, length of stay, and mortality. Overall mortality was 6.0% for patients aged less than 65 years and 8.6% for those older than 65. The injury severity score at which the probability of death was 10% was 17.3 in the older group and 24.9 in the younger group. Factors associated with outcome included cause of trauma (P less than .001), ISS (P less than .001), and number of complication factors (P less than .01). Preexisting risk factors were not significantly associated with outcome. We conclude that trauma in the elderly causes higher mortality with less severe injury, and that the mortality is related to the cause and severity of the trauma and the number of complications, and not to pre-existing disease. Length of stay increases with the severity of injury, except in the severely injured, who die.\r"
