  ".W": "IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha injure the pancreatic beta-cell and may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Because the induction of IL-6 appears to be an important host cell response to injury, we have examined whether IL-6 is produced by murine pancreatic islets or rat insulinoma (RIN-m5F) cells after their exposure to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Islet culture supernatants contained detectable IL-6 activity which was increased 6-fold when islets were exposed to IFN-gamma and 40- and 115-fold when islets were exposed to TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma, respectively. A mAb against murine IL-6 abolished (control and IFN-gamma) or significantly reduced (TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma) the IL-6 activity in islet supernatants. The magnitude for the effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha on the production of IL-6 from mouse islets was found to be both time and dose dependent. Northern blot hybridization analysis of islet total cytoplasmic RNA with a cDNA probe to murine IL-6 revealed a band at 1.3 kb, the intensity of which increased in islets exposed to IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha. IL-6 activity was also detected in culture supernatants from RIN-m5F cells exposed to TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma. Islets cultured with rIL-6 secreted higher levels of insulin compared with control islets. Pancreatic islet cells, in all probability beta-cells, produce IL-6, the expression of which is up-regulated by IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha. In addition to a possible role in regulating pancreatic beta-cell function we propose that IL-6 produced by the pancreatic beta-cell may act as a costimulator for autoreactive B and T lymphocytes in autoimmune diabetes.\r"

The stimulus used was PMA together with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. The growth and differentiation factors were rIL-2, together with either a Con A-stimulated spleen cell supernatant (CAS) or rIFN-gamma. CTL activity was monitored by an autoradiographic 111In-release assay. With CAS and rIL-2 present, 50% of all potential precursors (CTL-p) produced cytolytic clones. Substitution of rIFN-gamma for CAS gave a similar efficiency with up to 42% of CTL-p producing cytolytic clones. rIL-2 alone allowed only a small proportion (6%) of CD4-CD8+ T cells to become cytolytic clones. Addition of rIL-2 and rIFN-gamma at various stages of the culture demonstrated that IL-2 was required throughout, but exogenous IFN-gamma was required only during the early stages. It is concluded that for at least 40% of all CTL-p, the lymphokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma are essential and act in synergy to induce proliferation and differentiation into CTL.\r"

However, macrophages exposed to a second LPS stimulus are refractory and the amount of TNF detected in these supernatants is reduced 10- to 50-fold. The acquisition of the refractory state in vitro or in vivo requires the continued presence of LPS for a minimum of 6 to 8 h, is optimal by 20 h, and is reversible. Refractory macrophages incubated for an additional 48 h in the absence of LPS produce significant quantities of TNF after reexposure to endotoxin. Although LPS refractory macrophages do not release TNF in response to a secondary endotoxin challenge, riboprobe ribonuclease protection assays demonstrated amplification of TNF message, suggesting that post-transcriptional events are involved in the regulation of TNF production in endotoxin refractory macrophages. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed the accumulation of the 26-kDa TNF precursor in lysates of refractory macrophages, thus demonstrating a post-translational regulatory process. Although LPS refractory macrophages do not release TNF in response to a second LPS stimulus, ingestion of zymosan by these cells results in the release of significant quantities of TNF. Furthermore, LPS-refractory macrophages do not demonstrate a reduction in other effector functions including Fc-mediated erythrophagocytosis. Therefore, the LPS refractory state is a metabolically dependent post-translational regulatory process, which requires continuous LPS exposure, is specific in which macrophage effector functions are inhibited, and is reversible with further incubation or by non-LPS-related stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "T cell-independent Ag are believed to stimulate antibody formation in the relative absence of Ag processing and T cell help. Previous studies on the type 2 T cell independent (TI-2) Ag DNP-polyacrylamide, have shown that when one systematically varies the molecular mass and hapten valence, the immunogenic potential of this type of molecule depends on definable molecular characteristics. It was found that to be immunogenic, these molecules had to exceed a threshold molecular mass of 100,000 Da and a threshold hapten valence of 20. The present study was undertaken to determine whether such findings could be generalized to other molecules belonging to the TI-2 class of Ag. The molecular characteristics of five chemically different fluoresceinated (FL)-polymers were systematically varied, and their ability to stimulate an IgM antihapten immune response was measured. The polymers used as carriers were carefully size-fractionated and consisted of one natural polymer (dextran), one modified natural polymer (carboxymethyl cellulose), and three synthetic polymers (Ficoll, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyacrylamide). The carriers varied in physical structure from the highly cross-linked Ficoll, to the somewhat branched dextran, to the linear polyacrylamide, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polyvinyl alcohol. Polymers were haptenated with FL and size-fractionated so as to yield a panel of molecules with varying molecular mass, hapten valence, and hapten density. Anti-FL IgM response to these haptenated polymers was measured in vivo after i.p. injection of the FL-polymer in saline, and measured in vitro after culture with unfractionated spleen cells from naive mice. In agreement with the previous studies on DNP-polyacrylamide, it was found that to be immunogenic, each of the FL-polymers had to exceed a comparable threshold value of molecular mass and of hapten valence. Optimal immunogenicity occurred when the FL-polymers had values of mass and hapten density lying within a predictable range. Immunogenicity decreased when these optimal parameters were substantially increased or decreased. We conclude that the immunogenicity of soluble haptenated polymers depends on predictable physical molecular characteristics, and is relatively independent of the chemical composition and conformation of the carrier polymer.\r"

  ".U": "89309816\r", 
  ".W": "Upon stimulation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils with platelet-activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid (AA) is released from membrane phospholipids. The mechanism for AA liberation, a key step in the synthesis of biologically active eicosanoids, was investigated. PAF was found to elicit an increase in the cytoplasmic level of free Ca2+ as monitored by fluorescent indicator fura 2. When [3H] AA-labeled neutrophils were exposed to PAF, the enhanced release of AA was observed with a concomitant decrease of radioactivity in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine fractions. The inhibitors of phospholipase A2, mepacrine and 2-(p-amylcinnamoyl)-amino-4-chlorobenzoic acid, effectively suppressed the liberation of [3H]AA from phospholipids, indicating that liberation of AA is mainly catalyzed by the action of phospholipase A2. The extracellular Ca2+ is not required for AA release. However, intracellular Ca2+ antagonists, TMB-8 and high dose of quin 2/AM drastically reduced the liberation of AA induced by PAF, indicating that Ca2+ is an essential factor for phospholipase A2 activation. PAF raised the fluorescence of fura 2 at concentrations as low as 8 pM which reached a maximal level about 8 nM, whereas more than nM order concentrations of PAF was required for the detectable release of [3H]AA. Pretreatment of neutrophils with pertussis toxin resulted in complete abolition of AA liberation in response to PAF. However, the fura 2 response to PAF was not effectively inhibited by toxin treatment. In human neutrophil homogenate and membrane preparations, guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) stimulated AA release and potentiated the action of PAF. Guanosine 5'-O-(thiodiphosphate) inhibited the effects of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). These results suggest several points: 1) PAF stimulates human polymorphonuclear neutrophils to liberate AA mainly by the action of phospholipase A2; 2) Ca2+ mobilization alone is not sufficient to stimulate AA release, although Ca2+ is the important factor for phospholipase A2 activation; and 3) a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein may be implicated in activation of phospholipase A2.\r"

  ".W": "Essential fatty acids, from which PG derive, can participate in development and regulation of immune responses and have been shown to suppress inflammation and tissue injury in animal models. In this report, we investigate the effects of the immediate (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic acid (AA, PGE precursors, dihomogamma linolenic acid (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic acid (AA, precursor to PGE2), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, precursor to PGE3) on IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated human PBMC. DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production in a dose-dependent manner: half-maximal inhibition was obtained by using the fatty acids at the dose of 10 micrograms/ml without significant effects on cell viability. EPA inhibited IL-2 production by PBMC of only some donors. Incubation of cells in the presence of oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, which are not PG precursors, did not affect mitogen-induced IL-2 production. A progressive increase in incorporation of DGLA into cellular lipids was observed over a 48-h incubation period. IL-2 production was reduced also when PBMC were pretreated overnight with DGLA or AA and washed before exposure to PHA. Whereas addition of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, at the time of mitogenic stimulation led to increased IL-2 production and prevented mitogen- and fatty acid-induced increases in PGE release, it had no significant effect on the capacity of the fatty acids to suppress IL-2 production. Time course experiments showed that DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production even at times of minimal or no PGE release by the treated cultures. Moreover, DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production by the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat which, when appropriately induced, is able to release high levels of IL-2 in the absence of accessory cells and measurable PGE production. Taken together, these data indicate that essential fatty acids inhibit IL-2 production directly without conversion into their cyclo-oxygenase pathway products, and suggest that human lymphocyte function may be altered profoundly by small changes in their fatty acid profile.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the effects of overnight culture of human basophils with a variety of cytokines in the presence or absence of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The 24-h culture of basophils with a range of concentrations of several cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-4) had no effect either on anti-IgE-induced histamine release or the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on histamine release. IFN-gamma enhanced postculture releasability of human basophils. The concentration range for this effect was from 50 to 50,000 U/ml and maximal enhancement of anti-IgE-induced basophil histamine release was approximately 200% of control. IFN-gamma did not increase the number of occupied or unoccupied Fc epsilon RI on human basophils, suggesting that the enhancement of histamine release is a result of an intrinsic increase in the releasability mechanism. rIL-3 also augmented basophil releasability (approximately 250% of control) by a mechanism independent of alterations in basophil cell surface IgE density. The increase in post culture releasability occurred in both partially purified basophils (12 to 90% purity) and mixed leukocytes (approximately 1% basophils) although it was more marked in the former. Enhanced postculture releasability after exposure to IL-3 occurred for both IgE-dependent (anti-IgE) and peptide-mediated (fmet-leu-phe) responses and included elevations in the release of both histamine and sulfidopeptide leukotriene, suggesting a global increase in releasability. Basophils cultured in the presence of IL-3 were insensitive to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone; at 1,000 U/ml IL-3, dexamethasone inhibition of basophil mediator release was completely blocked. None of the other cytokines tested, with the exception of crude or partially purified IL-2 preparations, had this effect. IL-3 contamination may explain the ability of these partially purified \"IL-2\" preparations to block the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone, because this effect was abolished by a specific anti-IL-3 antibody. These results suggest that IFN-gamma and IL-3 may modulate the response of human basophils in allergic reactions. Furthermore, increased local production of IL-3 may \"prime\" basophils for increased releasability and override inhibitory effects of elevated systemic glucocorticoids on human basophils. Finally, we conclude that the effects of glucocorticoids on human basophils may be in part mediated indirectly by effects on cells which produce cytokines, such as IFN-gamma and IL-3, that can modulate basophil function.\r"

In order to define with greater precision, the molecular requirements for IgM polymer assembly, we have isolated several mutant hybridomas which produce monomeric IgM. For three such mutants, we synthesized cDNA clones of their mu mRNA and identified a mutation in the mu-chain which was responsible for the failure to assemble polymers. Mutant 205 has a 2-bp deletion which results in a termination codon after amino acid 556, effectively deleting the last 20 amino acids of the mu-chain. In conjunction with earlier reports, this result shows that the tail plays some role in assembly other than providing Cys-575, the penultimate amino acid, for disulfide bond formation. Both mutant 21 and mutant 201 have an A to G transition, which results in Tyr-455 in the fourth constant domain being replaced by a cysteine. We conclude that the integrity of both the C mu 4 domain and the 19 amino acid tail are required for the mu H chain to be assembled into polymeric IgM.\r"

  ".W": "Because glycosylation-dependent melanization inhibition induced in cultured B-16 melanoma cells by glucosamine is reversible, producing synchronized initiation of melanogenesis after its removal, we have analyzed the possible dynamics of initial melanogenesis through their interruption by glutathione. The addition of glutathione at 0.2% concentration to the theophylline-stimulated recovery process completely interrupts the initiation of melanization for at least 72 h. At the electron microscopic level, theophylline-treated cells have many vacuolar melanosomes with distinct pigmentation which contain some vesicles (64% of total premelanosomes) or amorphous, filamentous, or granular materials within the interior which are suggestive of pheomelanotic melanosomes. The addition of glutathione induces a complete absence of melanization in the premelanosomes, within which a filamentous interior with periodicity is generally re-formed with almost complete disappearance of internal vesicles, providing dramatic changes to the size and shape characteristic of eumelanotic melanosome. Electron microscopic dopa reaction of glutathione-treated cells shows a predominant localization of tyrosinase activity in the Golgi-associated endoplasmic reticulum-lysosome and coated vesicles, but not in premelanosomes, in contrast to their dispersed distribution in all melanogenic organelles in the theophylline-treated control, suggesting a lack of tyrosinase translocation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of tyrosinase in the large granule fraction shows that in analogy with electron microscopic observations, glutathione blocks the reappearance of membrane-bound T3 tyrosinase which occurs in the theophylline-treated control during the recovery process, whereas the dynamics of T1 tyrosinase is almost the same as that of the control. These findings suggest that glutathione provides a new situation of interrupted melanogenesis in which melanization cannot proceed despite complete formation of melanosome matrix structure and a lack of inhibition of cellular metabolisms including protein glycosylation.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) to affect cutaneous collagen synthesis in vivo was examined in a murine wounding model. Reproducible areas of full-thickness skin necrosis were produced by argon laser radiation. Mice received recombinant murine IFN-gamma (rMuIFN-gamma) (8.7 X 10(3) units/hr) over 14 d via osmotic pumps implanted subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. At 14 and 21 d after wounding, there was less fibrous tissue in healing scars of treated animals as determined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Associated with the decrease in connective tissue was an increase in the acid mucopolysaccharide content of healing scars, which was largely hyaluronate. Quantitative image analysis of electron micrographs confirmed that less collagen was present in healing scars of animals receiving rMuIFN-gamma. The mean cross-sectional area of collagen fibers was smaller in specimens from treated mice, but no difference was seen in the size of collagen fibrils. The time required to obtain full skin closure was also delayed 23%-27% in treated animals. Using this injury model, we also found that rMuIFN-gamma significantly reduced the degree of perilesional erythema surrounding the laser injury sites and, in the first 6 d after wounding, the degree of polymorphonuclear infiltrate present histologically at lesional sites. Indeed, rMuIFN-gamma also decreased the cutaneous accumulation of neutrophils induced by known proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin 1 and activated serum. Thus, systemically administered IFN-gamma not only down-regulates collagen synthesis in the skin but also modulates in a previously unrecognized manner: neutrophil accumulation at sites of tissue injury in vivo.\r"

It has been shown that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is capable of inducing human keratinocytes to express HLA-DR. Similar results, however, have not been duplicated in murine systems. The purpose of this study was to determine whether IFN-gamma was capable of inducing murine keratinocyte expression of Ia in vivo in an experimental model in which epithelial cells in a variety of organs were shown to express Ia after the i.v. injection of IFN-gamma. Recombinant murine IFN-gamma was injected into BALB/c mice. Biopsies of skin and intestine were analyzed by indirect immunoperoxidase to identify Ia-expressing keratinocytes and mucosal cells, respectively. Interferon-gamma was administered as either: 1) a single s.c. injection, 2) multiple i.v. injections of increasing doses (10(3)-10(5) U/d) on 3 consecutive d, or 3) i.p. injections of 5 X 10(4) U/d or 5 X 10(5) U/d on 6 consecutive d. At all i.v. and i.p. injection doses, the intestinal villi mucosal cells were induced to express Ia. Keratinocyte expression of Ia, however, was observed only in animals that received the two higher i.p. doses. Procedures to augment Ia expression, e.g., combined treatment with pertussis toxin, dinitrofluorobenzene, tumor necrosis factor, and indomethacin, did not enhance the ability of IFN-gamma to induce keratinocyte expression of Ia. We conclude that: 1) high doses of IFN-gamma are required to induce murine keratinocyte Ia expression in vivo and 2) low doses of IFN-gamma, although capable of inducing intestinal mucosal cells to express Ia, do not induce keratinocyte Ia expression.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the relative influence of central pharmacodynamic and peripheral pharmacokinetic factors on the duration of motor response to levodopa, the relationship between motor function and plasma levodopa levels was studied in 31 Parkinsonian patients. Duration of benefit from single levodopa doses while fasting depended on the degree to which the plasma levodopa level had declined over four hours; wearing off occurred when the plasma levodopa level had fallen to approximately 50% of peak concentration, irrespective of the duration of the motor response. Whilst the amplitude of motor response to levodopa is likely to be modified by alternations in dopamine receptor stimulation and sensitivity as the disease progresses, it is proposed that the duration of response is primarily determined by levodopa peripheral pharmacokinetics rather than by central pharmacodynamic factors associated with dopamine storage capacity.\r"

In the remaining 284 cases a comparison is made between the outcome in 124 (44%) patients treated by a conventional surgical method and 160 (56%) selected patients whose wound was only inspected, cleaned, and sutured in the emergency room. The nonsurgical group included 21 (9%) patients with simple depressed fractures and also patients without severe wound contamination, established infection, severe comminution of the fracture, or brain or cerebrospinal fluid in the wound. The results of management were assessed in relation to septic complications, the outcome of focal neurological abnormalities, and fatal complications. The group treated conservatively compared favorably with the surgical cases and also with previously reported series. The obvious bias in favor of the conservative group is admitted; however, it is clear that the majority of simple fractures and some compound depressed skull fractures can be managed safely without major surgical intervention. Socioeconomic implications are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89310710\r", 
  ".W": "By conventional criteria, an apneic patient's PaCO2 must be greater than 60 mm Hg before apnea can be attributed to brain death. The rate of a PaCO2 increase in the apneic patient traditionally has been thought to be in the range of 3 mm Hg/min. In order to assess the validity of these data and the validity of the \"apnea test\" for determination of brain death, the results of this test were reviewed in 20 patients. In all patients, arterial blood samples were drawn for blood gas measurements every 2 minutes following the cessation of volume ventilation (with an oxygen cannula at 6 liters O2/min passed into the tracheobronchial tree). The rate of PaCO2 increase was noted to be very erratic. The average rate of rise was 3.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg/min (+/- standard deviation). This, however, varied from 0.5 to 10.5 mm Hg/min and was not predictable from the variables evaluated. The rate of PaCO2 increase was noted to decline throughout the duration of the test. This ranged from 3.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg/min (for patients with baseline PaCO2 less than or equal to 30 mm Hg) and 4.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg/min (for patients with baseline PaCO2 greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg) in the first 4 minutes of the test to an average of 0.92 mm Hg/min for patients with test lasted longer than 12 minutes. These unpredictable results might be related to CO2 washout, atelectasis, cardiac ventilations, or other yet-undefined parameters. The nonlinear relationship between rate of PaCO2 increase and time following onset of apnea resulted in the test being prolonged in several patients. In these patients, the PaCO2 approached 60 mm Hg in an asymptotic fashion. These lengthy tests could have been avoided by utilizing a standardized apnea test with a baseline PaCO2 of 40 mm Hg or greater. The observation that a high baseline PaCO2 greatly augments the efficiency and safety of the test allows criteria that have previously been based on conjecture to be documented and applied clinically. A standardized apnea test, utilizing these principles, may satisfy many of the criticisms regarding brain-death testing that have been raised by neurologists, neurosurgeons, and transplant surgeons.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondrial preparations from riboflavin-deficient rats are known to exhibit reduced capacity for the oxidation of fatty acids. During a search for a suitable fatty acid probe for the in vivo exploration of this phenomenon, it became apparent that a dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, was more promising than a monocarboxylic acid such as octanoic acid. Rats made riboflavin deficient, and controls at various stages of development, were dosed intragastrically with [1,6-14C]adipic acid, and 14CO2 production was measured for 3 h. All animals were then given flavin mononucleotide intragastrically to replete their tissues, and the [14C]adipic acid test was repeated at intervals thereafter. In all groups, repletion produced a highly significant increase in the whole-body adipic acid oxidation index, and reversed the low rates of oxidation which had been observed in nonrepleted, deficient animals. This approach may therefore permit the development of a new functional test for fatty acid oxidation in human riboflavin deficiency, and for other conditions in which fatty acid oxidation pathways are impaired, by the use of nonradioactive [13C]adipic acid.\r"

Evidence was found of the disintegration of the implanted pericardium, which was extensively infiltrated by inflammatory cells. The collagen matrix of the membrane was distended and dissociated, showing signs of degradation by its stainability with trichrome stain. It was concluded that cross-linking of a collagenous structure such as pericardium does not prevent it from being resorbed. It is suggested that the cytotoxic residues of polymeric glutaraldehyde within the implant may render the implant more resistant to cellular degradation.\r"

That is, at baseline (low) pulmonary vascular tone adenosine and ATP produce vasoconstrictor responses and at elevated pulmonary vascular tone adenosine and ATP produce vasodilator responses. The mechanism mediating the vasodilator responses to adenosine and ATP was investigated in the intact-chest cat under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure. When lobar vascular resistance was raised with U46619, intralobar injections of adenosine and ATP caused dose-related decreases in lobar arterial pressure. The pulmonary vasodilator responses to ATP and adenosine were not altered by atropine, propranolol, meclofenamate or cimetidine indicating that these responses were not mediated by the release of vasodilator prostaglandins or to activation of beta adrenergic, muscarinic or histamine (H2) receptors. The decreases in lobar arterial pressure in response to adenosine were reduced significantly by BWA1433U, an adenosine (P1) receptor antagonist. BWA1433U induced a parallel shift of the adenosine dose-response curve to the right; however, it had no significant inhibitory effect on the decrease in lobar arterial pressure in response to ATP. The P1 receptor antagonist in doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. had no significant effect on the vasodilator response to nitroglycerin. The present data suggest that vasodilator responses to adenosine in the feline pulmonary vascular bed are mediated by adenosine (P1) receptors, whereas responses to ATP are mediated by a different mechanism that does not involve release of a vasodilator prostaglandin.\r"

All five compounds increased in a dose-related manner the latency for monkeys to remove their tails from warm water with the order of potency being MK-801 greater than PCP greater than ketamine greater than (+)-SKF 10,047 greater than dextrorphan. Moreover, these effects were temperature-dependent with larger doses required to produce a maximum response when higher temperatures (i.e., 55 degrees C) were studied. The effects of PCP, ketamine, dextrorphan, (+)-SKF 10,047 and MK-801 were not attenuated by a dose (1.0 mg/kg) of the opioid antagonist quadazocine that antagonized the analgesic effects of the opioid mu agonist alfentanil and kappa agonist U-50,488. MK-801, PCP, (+)-SKF 10,047 and dextrorphan also substituted in a dose-related manner for the ketamine discriminative stimulus (1.78 mg/kg) and their relative potency as discriminative stimuli was the same as their relative potency in the tail withdrawal procedure. The apparent analgesic effects of PCP-like drugs occurred at doses 2- to 8-fold larger than doses required for discriminative stimulus effects and 3- to 10-fold smaller than doses required for anesthesia. These results support the notion that PCP-like drugs produce analgesic effects at subanesthetic doses. Moreover, the analgesic effects of PCP and related drugs in rhesus monkeys were not mediated by actions at the opioid receptors known to be associated with analgesia.\r"

Protein malnutrition and sepsis can concomitantly occur with burn trauma. The role of pure malnutrition or sepsis, in the absence of burn injury, in inducing neuromuscular changes was studied in the mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Additionally, cAMP levels in muscle were evaluated to reflect metabolic activity. Sepsis was studied using doses of endotoxin at one-fourth or one-third the dose evoking 50% lethality. Diets of 5% protein and 5% protein + 35% fiber achieved protein and protein/calorie malnutrition, respectively. In each model neuromuscular function was evaluated by maximal tension developed. Pharmacologic responses were measured through effective dose to paralyze active tension by either 50 or 95%. Protein and protein/calorie malnutrition leading to an approximate 8% body weight loss caused a depression of maximal tension developed; this depression in tension was associated with a 10-fold increase in cAMP levels. Effective doses of d-tubocurarine for twitch inhibition during malnutrition were not significantly different from controls. Sepsis at 2 weeks caused an approximate 8% body weight loss, a significant decrease in maximal tension and at least a 3- to 5-fold shift to the right in dose-response curves to d-tubocurarine. In contrast to malnutrition, cAMP levels were significantly decreased (P less than .001) in sepsis to 1/400 of controls. The altered neuromuscular function and pharmacology observed in sepsis are similar to changes observed in burn injury. Protein malnutrition common to these two states may be important in functional but not pharmacological changes at the neuromuscular junction.\r"

  ".W": "After pretreatment with either clorgyline, a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A-selective inhibitor, or pargyline, an MAO-B-selective inhibitor with less selectivity than l-deprenyl, i.c.v. administration of para-hydroxyamphetamine (p-OHA) significantly increased both the frequency and total number of head-twitches in mice. A typical MAO-B-selective inhibitor, l-deprenyl, however, did not change the total count of the p-OHA-induced head-twitch response (HTR). These effects were also found with fixed doses of the selective MAO inhibitors when p-OHA was varied. Administration of clorgyline (1 mg/kg) or pargyline (5 mg/kg) almost inhibited completely MAO-A in the mouse forebrain, and pargyline also almost inhibited completely MAO-B. l-Deprenyl, in contrast, almost inhibited completely MAO-B without affecting MAO-A activity. Systemic administration of l-5-hydroxytryptophan also induced HTR and the total number of twitches was enhanced by clorgyline, but not by pargyline or l-deprenyl. Chlorimipramine or cocaine significantly reduced p-OHA-induced HTR, suggesting an intraneuronal site of action. Together with the presence of considerable MAO-A in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons of various animal species, and possible accumulation and subsequent monoamine-releasing properties of p-OHA, the present results indicate that p-OHA might induce the HTR by interaction with intraneuronally increased 5-HT. This mechanism probably results in 5-HT release onto the postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors. Taken together, different roles of MAO-B in \"the hyperactivity syndrome\" and the HTR are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Diazoxide caused an increase in 86Rb+ efflux from the rat aorta and portal vein and inhibited spontaneous activity of the latter at concentrations 100 times higher than the K+ channel opener cromakalim. In the rabbit aorta both drugs inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II, noradrenaline and low concentrations (less than or equal to 30 mM) of KCl in a similar manner, the antivasoconstrictor activities being abolished in vessels depolarized with greater than or equal to 35 mM K+. In vivo cromakalim was about 100 times more potent than diazoxide at lowering blood pressure in rats. Diazoxide (30 mg/kg) caused a more than 2-fold increase in plasma glucose in rats and prevented any return toward base line within 1.5 hr after a glucose load. Cromakalim had minimal effects upon glucose homeostasis at equihypotensive doses. Glibenclamide, a potent blocker of ATP-dependent K+ channels, inhibited the stimulation by cromakalim and diazoxide of 86Rb+ efflux from the portal vein and aorta (IC50 approximately 0.1 microM), antagonized their vasorelaxant effects in vitro and in vivo (20-30 mg/kg i.v.) and reversed the diazoxide-induced changes in plasma glucose and insulin levels. These results provide evidence that diazoxide, like cromakalim, is able to open 86Rb+-permeable K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle. This action is likely to be responsible for the in vitro and in vivo vasodilator activity of these two drugs. However, there would seem to be pharmacological differences between the K+ channels affected by these drugs in vascular smooth muscle and the (ATP-sensitive) K+ channels of pancreatic beta-cells, which are thought to be responsible for the effects of diazoxide on plasma glucose.\r"

  ".W": "The generation of free oxygen radicals from the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system produced a decrease in the steady-state calcium load of canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles and an increase in the SR passive calcium permeability. This effect of free oxygen radicals was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of superoxide anion radical (.O2-). Treatment of intact SR with a specific calmodulin antagonist, compound 48/80 or W-7, lead to the enhancement of the free oxygen radical-mediated reduction of steady-state calcium accumulation with little effect on passive calcium permeability and Ca,Mg-adenosine triphosphatase activity. The effects of free oxygen radicals and the calmodulin antagonists on steady-state calcium accumulation, but not on passive calcium permeability, were only observed in the presence of the endogenous calmodulin of SR vesicles. These results indicate that stimulation by .O2- and/or a closely related species of free oxygen radical of the passive calcium leak pathway is not calmodulin-dependent and is not a potent way of changing the steady-state calcium accumulation. Hence, we propose that calmodulin-dependent component of calcium fluxes in cardiac SR vesicles is modified directly by free oxygen radicals, and that free oxygen radicals can reduce steady-state calcium accumulation due to increased calcium release through a calcium efflux pathway which is inhibited by calmodulin, but not due to reduced catalytic activity of the pump.\r"

Cyclic GMP accumulation did not occur in BAE or BASM at any GTN concentration, whereas for RLF and PK1 it was highly correlated to the rate of GDN formation. Upon re-exposure to GTN after treatment of RLF or PK1 cells for 3 hr with 0.1 mM GTN, there was an almost complete loss of the cyclic GMP response, GTN biotransformation was attenuated markedly and the selective formation of 1,2-GDN at low GTN concentration was absent.

  ".W": "Fluoride (F-), a known stimulator of G-proteins, was used to examine the relationship between G-proteins and calcium channels (CaC) in rat vascular smooth muscle (VSM). Treatment of isolated rat tail artery helical strips with F- (2.5-20 microM) produced a Ca++-dependent contraction. In the absence of added AlCl3, subthreshold NaF shifted the KCl, as well as the arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine concentration-related tension curves to the left. Nifedipine and verapamil, known CaC blockers, inhibited the NaF-related contraction. AlCl3 (20 microM), which is required for G-protein stimulation by F-, strikingly potentiated the contractile response to F-. The NaF-induced contraction was relaxed by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as well as by forskolin and by dibutyryladenosine-cyclic AMP, and the effect therefore may be independent of cAMP. 45Ca-uptake was elevated by NaF, and partially blocked by nifedipine and verapamil. NaF also inhibited the basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, suggesting that F- stimulated the putative Gi in the intact VSM cells. NaF stimulated accumulation of IP in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that F- stimulated the putative G-protein Gp which couples various receptors to hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and mobilization of Ca++. These results indicate that NaF-induced vasoconstriction is related to the opening of the CaC in the plasma membrane and perhaps a subsequent entry of the extracellular Ca++ into the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies with fluoride have indicated that G-proteins may mediate the gating of Ca++ channels in vascular smooth muscle (VSM). We now present further studies on the relationship between G-proteins and Ca++ channels in VSM using guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), a hydrolysis-resistant analog of GTP. Rat tail artery helical strips pretreated with GTP gamma S in a cytosol-like solution contracted in a Ca++-dependent manner in the absence of a depolarizing concentration of K+, hormones or any other Ca++ agonists. Contraction was dependent on the concentrations of applied GTP gamma S. The ability of strips pretreated with GTP gamma S to contract in response to Ca++ was not reversed by repeated washing. Incubation with 1 mM GTP applied extracellularly did not induce tension development. Treatment with a subthreshold concentration of GTP gamma S shifted the K+ concentration-related tension curve to the left but did not alter the maximum response. The contractions induced by GTP gamma S pretreatment and by submaximal (60 mM) KCI were additive at all levels of Ca++ tested. Extra tension development could be evoked from tissue maximally contracted with GTP gamma S by adding maximal K+ and norepinephrine. The relaxing sensitivity of the GTP gamma S-related contraction to reversal by nifedipine was between those for K+ depolarization and norepinephrine, and the GTP gamma S-induced rise in tension was partially inhibited by the Ca++ channel blocker nifedipine. Ca++-elicited contraction of the GTP gamma S-pretreated strips was relaxed by forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, 3-isobutyl-l-methyl-xanthanine, a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the presence of external Ca++, the contraction induced by CL-A was accompanied by an increase in the cytosolic free Ca++ concentration [( Ca++]cyt) as measured by the fluorescence indicator fura-2. Verapamil (3 X 10(-6) M) inhibited the increase in [Ca++]cyt, but not tension development caused by CL-A. In the absence of external Ca++, CL-A still caused contraction without changing [Ca++]cyt. Thus, from studies with intact smooth muscle it was demonstrated that, in the absence of external Ca++, CL-A can induce a contraction that was not accompanied by an increase in [Ca++]cyt. In permeabilized taenia, CL-A caused contraction in the absence of Ca++ (with 2 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid) at concentrations similar to those required to contract intact tissue. This contraction was inhibited by the nonselective kinase inhibitors such as amiloride (1 X 10(-3) M) and K-252a (2 X 10(-5) M). Low concentrations of Ca++ (approximately 1 X 10(-6) M) augmented the CL-A-induced contraction in the permeabilized taenia.

A brief preincubation of the cartilage slices with bacterial collagenase was found to be an effective method of depleting proteoglycan. The addition of a fraction from bovine bone that contained partially purified \"matrigenin\" activity to the cultures resulted in the stimulation of incorporation of radioactive precursors into cartilage chondroitin sulfate, suggesting increased proteoglycan synthesis. The stimulatory effect of matrigenin activity was observed earlier and was more sustained if the cartilage slices were preincubated with collagenase. The system appears to be useful for testing the hypothesis that bone derived factors stimulate the repair of damaged cartilage.\r"

This prospective clinical trial examined the impact of early TEN vs. TPN in the critically injured. Seventy-five patients with an abdominal trauma index (ATI) greater than 15 and less than 40 were randomized at initial laparotomy to receive either TEN (Vivonex TEN) or TPN (Freamine HBC 6.9% and Trophamine 6%); both regimens contained 2.5% fat, 33% branched chain amino acids, and had a calorie to nitrogen ratio of 150:1. TEN was delivered via a needle catheter jejunostomy. Nutritional support was initiated within 12 hours postoperatively in both groups, and infused at a rate sufficient to render the patients in positive nitrogen balance. The study groups (TEN = 29 vs TPN = 30) were comparable in age, injury severity and initial metabolic stress. Jejunal feeding was tolerated unconditionally in 25 (86%) of the TEN group. Nitrogen balance remained equivalent throughout the study period, at day 5 TEN = -0.3 +/- 1.0 vs. TPN 0.1 +/- 0.8 gm/day. Traditional nutritional protein markers (albumin, transferrin, and retinol binding protein) were restored better in the TEN group. Infections developed in 5 (17%) of the TEN patients compared to 11 (37%) of the TPN group. The incidence of major septic morbidity was 3% (1 = abdominal abscess) in the TEN group contrasted to 20% (2 = abdominal abscess, 6 = pneumonia) with TPN. This clinical study demonstrates that TEN is well tolerated in the severely injured, and that early feeding via the gut reduces septic complications in the stressed patient.\r"

Sprague-Dawley rats were bled to maintain blood pressure at 45 mm Hg for 45 minutes and then resuscitated with shed blood and saline.

In a prospective study we measured plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels before and serially after relief of obstruction in 9 patients (mean age 65 +/- 2 years old) with bilateral ureteral obstruction and azotemia. Obstruction was documented by renal ultrasonography. Before relief of obstruction blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were 85 +/- 18 (mean +/- standard error) and 8.2 +/- 1.3 mg. per dl., respectively, accompanied by metabolic acidosis but not hyperkalemia. Mean plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (measured by radioimmunoassay) was 129 +/- 28, which was markedly elevated compared to 46 +/- 7 pg. per ml. in 7 age-matched control subjects (p less than 0.01). After relief of obstruction, prominent post-obstructive diuresis and natriuresis ensued; the plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level progressively decreased to that noted in the control group, accompanied by improvement in renal function, and diminishing diuresis and natriuresis. These findings were associated with a significant weight loss and an increase in plasma renin activity (from a mean of 1.57 +/- 0.68 to 5.27 +/- 1.82 ng. per ml. per hour, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide release is augmented in patients with bilateral ureteral obstruction and azotemia, probably due to hypervolemia, and may contribute to post-obstructive diuresis and natriuresis.\r"

  ".W": "Although transurethral resection of the prostate provides an effective treatment for obstructive voiding symptoms associated with prostate cancer, there is growing concern about the possible role of transurethral resection in the dissemination of this malignancy. To determine the effect of transurethral resection on the rate of development of distant metastasis, we analyzed a large series of patients (379) treated at our institution with definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer that was diagnosed by either needle biopsy or transurethral prostatic resection. In our series the presence of lymph node metastasis was documented by pelvic lymph node dissection in all patients. An initial univariate analysis suggested that patients diagnosed by transurethral resection had distant metastases significantly more rapidly than patients diagnosed by needle biopsy. However, transurethral resection usually was performed because of the presence of obstructive voiding symptoms and such patients were much more likely to have positive lymph node dissections than patients without obstructive voiding symptoms. A proportional hazards regression analysis showed that nodal status and the degree of obstructive voiding symptoms at diagnosis were independent and powerful predictors of the interval to distant metastases, along with stage and grade. The type of initial biopsy (transurethral prostatic resection versus needle biopsy) had no independent prognostic significance in this analysis. Among patients who had substantial obstructive voiding symptoms there was no significant difference in interval to distant metastases between the transurethral prostatic resection and needle biopsy groups. We conclude that the apparent adverse effect of transurethral prostatic resection results from the poor prognosis of tumors causing obstructive voiding symptoms rather than as a direct result of the resection itself.\r"

We determined the progression and cancer specific survival rates based on the extent of nodal metastases in 511 patients followed for a mean of 8.6 years (range 2.5 to 17.5 years) after bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and irradiation therapy. The patients were divided into 4 groups based on the extent of nodal metastases: NO--negative nodes (359 patients), N1--a single microscopic positive node (37), N2--multiple microscopic positive nodes (86) and N3--grossly positive or juxtaregional nodes (29). The risks of distant metastases and of dying of prostate cancer were much greater in the 152 patients with positive nodes (N+) than in those with negative nodes (p less than 0.00005). The risk of metastatic disease at 10 years was only 31 +/- 7 per cent for the NO patients compared to 83 +/- 7 per cent for the N+ patients, and the risk of dying of prostate cancer was only 17 +/- 6 per cent at 10 years for the NO group and 57 +/- 11 per cent for the N+ patients. Patients with a single microscopic node (N1) had a pattern of progression and cancer specific mortality rate similar to patients with more extensive nodal metastases and markedly worse than patients with negative nodes. The risk of distant metastases was 80 +/- 15 per cent at 10 years for the N1 group, 84 +/- 11 per cent for the N2 group and 88 +/- 13 per cent for the N3 group, while the risk of dying of prostate cancer at 10 years was 40 +/- 19, 66 +/- 15 and 58 +/- 24 per cent, respectively. The finding of a single pelvic lymph node containing microscopic metastatic disease markedly worsened the prognosis of our patients with prostate cancer. Once prostate cancer is found within the pelvic lymph nodes the patient has systemic disease unlikely to be controlled by pelvic lymph node dissection and radiotherapy.\r"

If a chemical in solution is present when the vesicles form, the chemical will be trapped in either the aqueous interspaces (hydrophilic compounds), or the lipid bilayer (hydrophobic compounds). The urinary bladder is an attractive site for the topical application of liposome encapsulated compounds due to its accessibility and since the introduction of various agents, including antineoplastic compounds, into the bladder is a well established treatment option. Utilization of liposome technology may provide the means for a more effective intravesical treatment of transitional cell carcinoma.\r"

The physical examination was of no value in predicting which patient with a varicocele would display evidence of testicular dysfunction. We suggest that the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone stimulation test become a routine part of the evaluation of an adolescent with a varicocele.\r"

  ".W": "To study the morbidity and mortality rates after placement of an inferior vena cava filter and to define the appropriate indications for interruption of the inferior vena cava, the records of all patients who underwent insertion of a Greenfield filter during the decade January 1978 to December 1987 were reviewed. Patients were designated as having either a traditional or extended indication for placement of an inferior vena cava filter. Two hundred sixty inferior vena cava filters were placed in 264 attempts, with no deaths related to insertion of the filter. An extended indication was the primary reason for placement of the Greenfield filter in 66 (25%) of the patients. In patients with extended indications there were no cases of air embolism or filter misplacement and only three wound complications (4.5%). Pulmonary embolism after insertion of the inferior vena cava filter occurred in three patients (4.5%), with one fatality (1.5%). Inferior vena cava occlusion was documented in three cases (4.5%), and manifestations of the postphlebitic syndrome in early follow-up were present in two patients (3.0%). As the procedures to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism have become safer, more efficacious, and less morbid, the number of patients in whom the potential benefits of insertion of an inferior vena cava filter outweigh the risks has become larger. Our results support the liberalized use of Greenfield filters in those patients who do not necessarily have one of the traditional indications for placement of an inferior vena cava filter but are at a high risk of having a fatal pulmonary embolus.\r"

  ".W": "Tear gas has gained widespread acceptance as a means of controlling civilian crowds and subduing barricaded criminals. The most widely used forms of tear gas have been o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile and omega-chloroacetophenone. Proponents of their use claim that, if used correctly, the noxious effects of exposure are transient and of no long-term consequences. The use of tear gas in recent situations of civil unrest, however, demonstrates that exposure to the weapon is difficult to control and indiscriminate, and the weapon is often not used correctly. Severe traumatic injury from exploding tear gas bombs as well as lethal toxic injury have been documented. Moreover, available toxicological data are deficient as to the potential of tear gas agents to cause long-term pulmonary, carcinogenic, and reproductive effects. Published and recent unpublished in vitro tests have shown o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile to be both clastogenic and mutagenic. Sadly, the nature of its use renders analytic epidemiologic investigation of exposed persons difficult. In 1969, eighty countries voted to include tear gas agents among chemical weapons banned under the Geneva Protocol. There is an ongoing need for investigation into the full toxicological potential of tear gas chemicals and renewed debate on whether their use can be condoned under any circumstances.\r"

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage distribution was I-3, II-7, III-24, and IV-28. The choice of treatment was nonrandomized. The local control was 10/18 with high-dose preoperative radiation, 17/30 with external beam radiation only, and 4/14 with external beam plus interstitial implantation. The median survival for the three treatment regimens were 63, 51, and 13 months, respectively. Preoperative radiation is suggested for tumors with inferior (laryngeal) spread or those with extensive superior extension (to tonsillar fossa and beyond). For centrally placed lesions in the base of the tongue (with or without lateral hypopharyngeal wall spread), radiation alone is recommended. An interstitial implantation should be restricted to lesions equal to or less than 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm3. Since this insertion is technically more demanding than for tumors of the mobile tongue, they should be performed by the more experienced brachytherapist.\r"

The study group included 38 patients with carcinoma of the breast, stomach, prostate, or female genital organs or metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin. A control group of 32 patients with similar malignancies received \"conventional\" chemotherapy without DFMO. Polyamine levels were determined periodically in the urine of all patients. In DFMO-treated patients, a significant decrease in putrescine and spermidine levels was observed after 3 weeks of DFMO therapy (the first time point evaluated) that usually persisted throughout the course of treatment. Significant differences in polyamine levels between DFMO-treated and control patients were observed for patients in remission. Less significant differences were noted, however, for patients with static or progressive disease between DFMO-treated and control groups. DFMO activity appears to be reflected by a long-term decrease in urinary polyamine levels.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to assess the results of pharyngeal reconstruction with the pectoralis musculocutaneous flap following composite resection and neck dissection. Thirty-five patients who had predominantly advanced disease (88% stage IV) were treated in the Department of Otolaryngology at The Ohio State University. Oral diet was tolerated by 73.5% of the patients at the time of discharge. Of these, 80% were on a soft diet. Ultimately, 91% of the patients were able to tolerate an oral diet. The median hospital stay was 13 days. The estimated blood loss, blood replacement, complications, days to decannulation, and surgical time were analyzed. These results suggest that flap reconstruction leads to short hospitalization and provides an excellent opportunity for an oral diet.\r"

Our review of the recent literature, however, failed to identify any publication on the use of ABR and acoustic reflex testing in the pediatric neurofibromatosis population. This study reports on a standardized differential diagnostic battery conducted on 44 children diagnosed as having neurofibromatosis. Results of the neuroaudiologic battery indicated that 32% of the children had significant abnormalities on ABR and acoustic reflex dynamic tests. This is a substantially higher prevalence of abnormalities than reported by another group at a recent NIH concensus meeting on neurofibromatosis. Discussion of the implications of these findings regarding evaluation protocols, as well as management for this select patient population, will follow.\r"

  ".U": "89314058\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the timing of pubertal development and the frequency of gonadal dysfunction in children who survive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we assessed pubertal status and the plasma levels of sex steroids, gonadotropin, and inhibin in 45 children (20 girls and 25 boys) who had received combination chemotherapy along with 24 Gy of irradiation to the cranium (modified LSA2L2 protocol). We also reexamined testicular biopsy specimens, obtained at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, for the presence of germ cells. Germ-cell damage, indicated by marked elevations in the plasma level of follicle-stimulating hormone (P less than 0.001 for the comparison with normal children), was evident in both sexes and was confirmed in the boys by the absence of germ cells in the testicular biopsy specimens and by the small size of the testes for pubic-hair stage. Only 44 percent of the pubertal girls had measurable plasma inhibin levels, as compared with more than 93 percent of normal pubertal girls. Although plasma sex-steroid levels were normal, the secretion of luteinizing hormone in response to stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone was elevated in the pubertal children (P less than 0.01 for the comparison with normal controls)--a finding that suggests compensation for decreased gonadal function. Despite clear evidence of gonadal damage, girls had early menarche at a mean age (+/- SD) of 11.95 +/- 0.91 years, as compared with the Australian standard of 12.98 +/- 1.11 years (P less than 0.01). Thus, in girls, puberty was early despite primary gonadal damage. Thirteen of 23 boys reached puberty at a mean age of 12.36 +/- 0.73 years. We conclude that treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may lead to primary gonadal damage in both sexes, regardless of the age at treatment, but that the secondary characteristics of puberty develop at a normal age or, in girls, relatively early.\r"

Of the 21 patients with evaluable supratentorial anaplastic gliomas, 2 (9.5%) had a partial response and 10 (47.6%) had stable disease. The median time to tumor progression for the anaplastic gliomas has not been attained yet. However, median survival for these 12 patients was 119 weeks measured from the initiation of chemotherapy. Median survival for the entire anaplastic glioma group of 21 was 56 weeks. Minimal activity was seen against glioblastoma multiforme. The median time to tumor progression was 8 weeks with median survival of 21 weeks. Of the 5 patients with brain stem tumors, 3 are alive with stable disease at 77, 93, and 220 weeks. The combination was well tolerated with dose-limiting toxicity being myelosuppression and hearing loss. Further trials are warranted to compare the combination of BCNU and DFMO against BCNU alone in a prospective randomized trial.\r"

  ".W": "Multi-level cervical spondylosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) are well-documented causes of myelopathy. The choice of surgical procedures remain controversial. Between January 1983 and December 1987, we have performed anterior cervical vertebrectomy in 45 patients with cervical myelopathy caused by multi-level spondylosis and OPLL. They consisted of 19 patients with cervical spondylosis, 12 with OPLL, and 14 with combined lesions of both cervical spondylosis and OPLL. There were 32 men and 13 women. The mean age was 55 years, ranging from 35 to 70 years. In all of our 45 patients, anterior vertebrectomy, discectomy, removal of posterior osteophytes and OPLL, and interbody fusion were done for progressive myelopathy refractory to conservative treatment. In 2 of 45 patients, 5 vertebral bodies were resected; in 3 patients, 4 vertebral bodies were resected; in 12 patients, 3 vertebral bodies were resected, in 19 patients, 2 vertebral bodies were resected; and in 9 patients, 1 vertebral body was resected. Thirty-nine of 45 patients (87%) had good results. Neurological signs did not improve in 5 patients (11%). One patient died because of agranulocytosis secondary to treatment with antibiotics. In conclusion, cervical cord compression caused by lesions located principally in the anterior aspect of the spinal canal may be completely relieved via anterior vertebrectomy, discectomy, removal of the calcified ligament, and fusion.\r"

However, this response depends on provision of enteral nutrients. If total parenteral nutrition without enteral feeding is prolonged, hypoplasia of the intestinal mucosa results. Adaptation is probably mediated through the presence of luminal nutrients, particularly glutamine, which is preferentially used by the intestine. However, systemic hormonal factors, possibly gastrin, cholecystokinin, and glucagon, also influence intestinal adaptation. Thus, in the management of short-bowel syndromes, enteral nutrition should be added to total parenteral nutrition as soon as possible.\r"

The mean pH was 7.29 in preterm infants and 7.28 in term infants. Mean values for pCO2, pO2, HCO3, and base deficit were similar in each group. There were no significant differences in umbilical artery blood gas values in the 77 preterm infants according to birth weight groups. Umbilical cord blood acid-base determination may prove a useful adjunct in assessing the condition of the newborn preterm infant.\r"

Ninety-six percent of K-Sol grafts (n = 51) and 94% of the CSM grafts (n = 51) were clear at 6 months; 92% of both the K-Sol (n = 38) and CSM (n = 35) grafts were clear at 12 months. One primary donor failure occurred, a K-Sol cornea stored for 76 hours. The CSM group experienced a greater number of persistent epithelial defects beyond 2 weeks (7 versus 4 defects) and graft reaction episodes (7 versus 3 episodes) than the K-Sol group; however, an equal number of late graft failures (3) occurred in both groups. No significant differences by paired t test analyses were found in endothelial cell density, area, coefficient of variation, or figure coefficient at 3 (n = 37 pairs), 6 (n = 36 pairs), and 12 (n = 26 pairs) months between the two groups. Mean endothelial cell density significantly decreased by 11% +/- 22 by 3 months in the K-Sol group, whereas the 7% +/- 24 decrease in the CSM group was insignificant. By 12 months, both groups experienced a significant decrease: K-Sol, 27% +/- 22; CSM, 17% +/- 26. A significant decrease in the mean coefficient of variation (polymegathism) was noted after 3 months in the K-Sol group which returned to the preoperative mean by 1 year, whereas this parameter remained unchanged in the CSM group. Both chondroitin sulfate-based media result in successful corneal transplantation with storage up to 4 days; however, endothelial survival with both media are comparable with previous studies with McCarey-Kaufman (M-K) medium.\r"

Otologic manifestations of tympanicum and jugulare tumors usually precede or accompany neurologic findings. In reviewing five cases of glomus vagale tumors, the initial symptom of voice change, caused by vocal cord paralysis, preceded the presenting symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus by an average of 2.5 years. The concept of early cranial nerve involvement by glomus vagale tumors is supported in a literature review. The evaluation of \"idiopathic\" vocal cord paralysis must include radiographic inspection of the skull base, whereas an accurate, temporal account of presenting symptoms may help distinguish vagal body tumors from other vascular neoplasms of this region.\r"

The entire arytenoid is next mobilized and tilted laterally, then fixed into position along the posterior margin of the thyroid cartilage by two or three permanent retention sutures. Careful placement of these sutures renders the laryngeal mucosa maximally undisturbed and is largely responsible for the predictable results achieved with this technique. During the past 2 years, 18 patients received this static procedure, and 17 of 18 (94%) required a tracheotomy as part of the treatment because of a uniformly severe degree of glottic obstruction. All tracheotomy patients have been permanently decannulated (on an average) 14 days after surgery. The evaluation of each patient included pre- and post-operative measurements of airway resistance that correlated well with the width of the posterior commissure, and proved invaluable in successful decannulation efforts.\r"

The ECoG recordings were examined quantitatively with regard to absolute amplitude of the summating potential and action potential. Recordings were examined qualitatively in terms of overall waveform quality and ease of component wave identification. All patients demonstrated a clear response with both electrodes. Although the transtympanic electrode resulted in the most robust responses in overall amplitude, the tympanic membrane electrode provided recordings equal to or, in most cases, superior to other noninvasive, extratympanic methods currently available. Furthermore, in our patient population, the likelihood of a positive (upward-going) summating potential was less for the tympanic membrane electrode recordings than for the TT electrode recordings. The major advantages of the TM electrode system are its unique method of stimulus delivery and its ease of application.\r"

Calorics revealed proportionately more abnormalities in patients with vertigo, whereas posturography alone did not distinguish between patients with or without vertigo. Posturography did, however, identify abnormalities in a third of patients with normal calorics, regardless of their history of vertigo. Overall, more patients with vertigo had at least one abnormal test result (70%) compared with patients without vertigo (47%). We conclude that caloric abnormalities correlate with a history of vertigo, whereas posturographic deficits can be identified regardless of the presence of vertigo.\r"

The avascular nature of this injury renders systemic antibiotic therapy ineffective in delivering adequate levels of drug to the area to provide antimicrobial activity. Treatment has traditionally been surgery in some form, resulting in further disfigurement of the damaged cartilagenous framework. Iontophoresis, a method of dispersing charged particles through a relatively impermeable membrane by a light electrical field, appears to be a feasible method of antibiotic delivery. This initial pilot study investigated the development of perichondritic-like burns in ten rabbit ears, and techniques for gentamicin iontophoresis and assay in devitalized cartilage. Five rabbits, with ear burns simulating perichondritis, were treated with gentamicin iontophoresis on one ear and gentamicin-soaked gauze on the other. Resulting assays of the ear cartilages, after four treatments over a 2-day period, demonstrated a nearly twenty-fold increase in gentamicin levels in the iontophoresis-treated ears, compared to low levels in the soaked ears. Systemic absorption was negligible in all rabbits.\r"

After one follow-up attempt, 114 questionnaires were completed and returned (80% response). Overall, a high percentage of cases reported postoperative improvement in breathing difficulties (90%), nasal congestion (88%), headache/facial pain (85%), recurrent sinus infections (83%), and postnasal drip (80%). In addition, 88% of cases reported the surgery to be of some overall health benefit.

Despite visual and histochemical evidence of reinnervation, it is still not known whether the excitability of a nerve-muscle pedicle (or for that matter a direct nerve implant) is equivalent to or better than that of reinnervated or normal muscle. Such information is necessary for the eventual construction of an implantable stimulator. Eighteen rabbits were anesthetized with intramuscular xylazine and ketamine and the ansa hypoglossi nerve was cut on one side. A crossover nerve-muscle pedicle was brought in from the opposite sternothyroid muscle to the sternohyoid in nine animals; the other nine received a direct nerve implant. After a minimum neurotization period of 3 months and reexploration, an electrical stimulator capable of delivering square wave pulses of variable amplitude and width was used to determine the thresholds of contraction of the nerve pedicles, an intact motor nerve of similar size, a normal muscle, and the reinnervated strap in 16 evaluable rabbits. Strength duration curves were established. The data indicate that thresholds for nerve pedicles are equivalent to those of normal nerves and are significantly lower than those of muscle.\r"

Surgical removal of these tumors often results in an unexplained prolonged postoperative ileus, even in cases in which the vagus nerve is preserved. There is evidence that these tumors may secrete neuropeptides, such as cholecystokinin, in addition to catecholamines. A retrospective analysis of cases of glomus tumors of the skull base operated on at The Otology Group was carried out to correlate preoperative neuropeptide levels, vagus nerve status at surgery, and duration of postoperative ileus. High circulating levels of cholecystokinin associated with these tumors may be responsible for the unexplained phenomenon of prolonged postoperative ileus. The relevance of neuropeptides to the postoperative management of these patients is discussed. Preventive measures that may avert the potentially lethal complications of aspiration and negative nitrogen balance are described.\r"

Reconstruction of these wound areas frequently requires multiple operations and prolonged hospitalization. We have successfully reconstructed complicated head and neck wounds in thirteen patients by means of a single-stage microvascular tissue transfer of the greater omentum with or without an attached segment of the stomach wall. There were 11 complete successes, two partial failures, and no complete failures. We describe four cases to illustrate the basic fundamentals of this reconstructive technique.\r"

Such events have been correlated with changes in intraoperative auditory evoked potentials. The possibility of a reversible conduction block in the cochlear nerve, however, has not been investigated. Review of four cases of delayed spontaneous recovery of hearing several months after acoustic tumor resection suggests that a conduction block phenomenon may exist. By comparing recent pertinent animal data with clinical intraoperative electrophysiologic data obtained during posterior fossa surgery in human subjects, we attempt to elucidate further the pathophysiology and intraoperative predisposing factors to cochlear nerve injury during hearing preservation procedures.\r"

Our results demonstrate that enhancer activity is located in introns 3 and 5 as well as 5' to the transcription initiation site. RNase protection experiments corroborate the results. Preliminary experiments indicate that B7 enhancers are active in various cell types. The role of these enhancers in B7 gene expression is not known at present.

It consists of a single chain of 321 residues with an N-acetylated N-terminal methionine and an unusually proline-rich C-terminal region. The enzyme is structurally related to the two cytoplasmic domains of both the leukocyte common antigen CD45 and LAR, a CD45-like molecule with an external segment that resembles a neural cell adhesion molecule. A low molecular weight protein encoded by a cDNA clone from T cells also shows extensive sequence similarities. The present study defines homologous domains common to this diverse family of PTPases that includes both soluble and receptor-like transmembrane forms. The cysteinyl residues 121 and 215 of PTPase 1B are conserved among all members of the family and are candidates for involvement in catalysis since PTPase 1B is inactivated by thiol modifying reagents. Two segments rich in positively charged residues (residues 33-47 and 227-238) may provide sites of interaction with inhibitory anionic polymers such as heparin or poly(Glu/Tyr).\r"

It contained 1305 base pairs of open reading frame followed by a TAA stop codon and 978 base pairs of 3' untranslated end, although a poly(A)+ tail was not found. An initiator methionine residue was predicted at position 61, which would result in a protein of 415 amino acid residues (Mr, 48,400). This was supported by the synthesis of a Mr 48,000 protein in an in vitro reticulocyte lysate translation system using RNA transcribed from the cloned cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to other known proteins revealing 65% identity to the low Mr PTPase 1B isolated from placenta.

  ".W": "A number of viral and cellular proteins contain covalently bound lipid. In a subset of these acyl proteins, the 14-carbon saturated fatty acid myristic acid is attached through an amide linkage to an NH2-terminal glycine residue. Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) transfers the myristoyl moiety from myristoyl-CoA to these nascent proteins and is highly selective for fatty acid chain length. We have found that 10-(propoxy)decanoyl-CoA (11-oxymyristoyl-CoA), an analog of myristic acid with reduced hydrophobicity, acts as a substrate for NMT both in vitro and in vivo. Comparison of the in vitro kinetic properties of a number of synthetic octapeptide substrates of NMT using myristoyl-CoA or 11-oxymyristoyl-CoA indicated that there is an interaction between the acyl-CoA and peptide binding sites of this acyltransferase. Peptide catalytic efficiency with 11-oxymyristoyl-CoA was reduced relative to that with myristoyl-CoA, but the extent of the reduction varied widely among the octapeptides tested. These in vitro data accurately predicted that only a subset of myristoyl proteins synthesized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a murine myocyte-like cell line (BC3H1) would incorporate 11-oxy[3H]myristate. Substitution of the myristoyl moiety by the 11-oxymyristoyl moiety does not significantly affect the membrane association of most N-myristoyl proteins. However, for the tyrosine kinase p60v-src and a 63-kDa N-myristoyl protein in BC3H1 cells, analog incorporation results in marked redistribution from the membrane to the cytosolic fraction. These studies demonstrate the utility of heteroatom-containing analogs for analysis of the role of myristate in acyl protein targeting. The sequence-specific nature of analog incorporation and the protein-specific effects on membrane association suggests that these compounds may represent a useful class of antiviral and antitumor agents.\r"

Transcription termination is thought to involve two distinct steps: pausing of the transcription complex at the terminator and release of enzyme and RNA; either or both steps might be inhibited by Q protein. We show that Q-modified RNA polymerase pauses much less efficiently than does unmodified enzyme at the natural pause sites of a rho-dependent terminator as well as at other pause sites. This changed behavior can account for the termination properties of Q-modified RNA polymerase and reflects a fundamental alteration of the elongation properties of the enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "To study the structure and function of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) involved in mammalian gametogenesis, a rat testis cDNA library was screened at low stringency with a cDNA clone coding for the Drosophila melanogaster dunce-encoded PDE as a probe. This screening resulted in the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones, differing in their nucleotide sequences (ratPDE1 and ratPDE2). In the rat testis, RNA transcripts corresponding to both groups of clones were expressed predominantly in germ cells. Additional screenings of a Sertoli cell cDNA library with a ratPDE2 clone as a probe led to the isolation of two more groups of clones (rat-PDE3 and ratPDE4). Unlike ratPDE1 and ratPDE2, these clones hybridized to transcripts present predominantly in the Sertoli cell. In the middle of the coding region, all four groups of clones were homologous to each other. The deduced amino acid sequences of part of this region were also homologous to the D. melanogaster dunce PDE and to PDEs from bovine and yeast. These data indicate that a family of genes homologous to the D. melanogaster dunce-encoded PDE is present in the rat and that these genes are differentially expressed in somatic and germ cells of the seminiferous tubule. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed heterogeneity of cAMP PDEs.\r"

The set of strains allows detection of each transition and transversion simply by monitoring the Lac- to Lac+ frequency, as demonstrated here with characterized mutagens and mutator alleles. These strains are useful for rapidly determining the mutagenic specificity of mutagens at a single site, for detecting low levels of stimulation of certain base substitutions, for monitoring specific base changes in response to various experimental conditions or strain backgrounds, and for isolating new mutator strains.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary surfactant is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II cells. These cells recycle surfactant lipids by an internalization process that is enhanced in vitro by the surfactant proteins with molecular masses of 26-36 kDa (SP-A). SP-A also inhibits the secretion of lipid by type II cells. These results suggest that SP-A may play a role in feedback regulation of surfactant pool size and are consistent with the hypothesis that the type II cell surface has receptors for SP-A. The goal of this study is to characterize the binding of radioiodinated SP-A to isolated rat type II cells. Binding of SP-A to type II cells at 4 degrees C has a K1/2 of approximately 5 X 10(-10) M, is saturable, and is inhibited by excess unlabeled SP-A. Binding is dependent on calcium and is reduced by heat treatment of SP-A. The binding of a proteolytic fragment of SP-A that is produced by collagenase treatment is reduced by excess unlabeled SP-A. The binding of the fragment to macrophages and lung fibroblasts is not inhibited by excess unlabeled SP-A. Trypsinization of the type II cell surface reduces the binding of both intact SP-A and the collagenase-resistant fragment. These results show that SP-A binds to type II cells with high affinity and suggest that these cells have receptors that recognize the carboxyl-terminal domain of SP-A.\r"

  ".U": "89315809\r", 
  ".W": "Binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) to its receptor has been shown not only to focus proteolytic activity to the cell surface but also to exert a mitogenic effect on the human epidermal tumor cell line CCL 20.2. This report shows that u-PA is an autocrine mitogen in the human melanoma cell line GUBSB and that inhibition of receptor-bound u-PA by specific anti-u-PA antibodies causes a significant suppression of cell proliferation in this system. The GUBSB cell line secretes 70-80% of the u-PA in its active form and expresses high-affinity u-PA receptors with a Kd of 5.2 x 10(-10) M and 2.8 x 10(4) binding sites per cell. Approximately 70% of the u-PA receptors on these cells are occupied by endogenously secreted u-PA. Addition of the monoclonal anti-u-PA antibody MPW5UK (10 nM), directed against the active site of u-PA, twice daily to the cell cultures resulted in a significant decrease of [3H]thymidine incorporation by the tumor cells, whereas a 10 times higher concentration of the monoclonal antibody MPW4UK, which does not inhibit plasminogen activator activity of u-PA, was necessary to achieve the same effect. In addition, diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated u-PA, in a concentration 50-fold higher than the concentration necessary to saturate the u-PA receptor (250 pM), decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation similarly to the specific antibody, proving that active u-PA is required for the mitogenic effect. Inhibition of endogenous u-PA production by cycloheximide reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation significantly; after addition of exogenous u-PA, [3H]thymidine incorporation increased again in the cycloheximide-treated cells. Therefore, inhibition of receptor-bound u-PA might represent a tool not only to inactivate cell-bound proteolytic activity, necessary for invasion, but also to exert a specific antiproliferative effect on certain tumor cells.\r"

Interestingly, \"hotspots\" of enzyme cutting occur within the MAR of the mouse immunoglobulin kappa-chain gene at the breakpoint of a previously described chromosomal translocation. Since topoisomerase II can mediate illegitimate recombination in prokaryotes, we explored further the possibility that MARs might be targets for this process in eukaryotes. We found that a MAR had been deleted from one of the two rabbit immunoglobulin kappa-chain genes and that MARs reside next to a long interspersed repetitive element within the recombination junction of a human ring chromosome 21. These results, taken together with other accounts of nonhomologous recombination, lead to the proposal that a dysfunction of MARs is illegitimate recombination.\r"

(i) Genomic DNAs of reference cells and test cells are digested with the same restriction enzyme. (ii) The DNA restriction fragments from the test cells are radioactively labeled. (iii) The labeled DNA fragments of test cells are mixed with unlabeled DNA fragments from reference cells that are 100- to 1000-fold in excess and the mixture is electrophoresed in an agarose gel. (iv) After electrophoresis, DNA fragments are alkali-denatured; this is followed by renaturation in situ in the gel. The labeled rearranged DNA fragments from the test cells will renature much slower, as compared with the nonrearranged fragments, since in this location of the gel these rearranged fragments do not have a counterpart in the driver DNA, which is in excess. (v) The DNA gel is electrophoresed in a second dimension perpendicular to the first dimension after renaturation. The denatured rearranged DNAs are revealed after autoradiography, since single-stranded DNA fragments have higher electrophoretic mobility than double-stranded fragments of the same sizes. This process of detection has been demonstrated in this report by using Escherichia coli HB101 as the reference strain and E. coli HB101 carrying lambda phage DNA (1:1 genomic ratio) as the test strain.\r"

Eight independent mutants obtained by insertion of Tn916 were isolated that were resistant to methicillin treatment following internalization by the J774 macrophage-like cell line. Seven mutants were absolutely defective for intracellular growth, whereas one showed abortive intracellular growth. The majority of the mutants were nonhemolytic and lacked a secreted 58-kDa polypeptide thought to be the L. monocytogenes hemolysin, listeriolysin O. Southern blot analysis indicated that one mutant contained a Tn916 insertion in hlyA, the listeriolysin O structural gene, which resulted in a truncated listeriolysin O polypeptide, whereas another mutant contained an insertion immediately upstream of hlyA, which resulted in reduced expression of listeriolysin O. The other mutants contained Tn916 insertions in genes other than hlyA, although all but one were nonhemolytic. Revertants isolated by their ability to grow within tissue culture cells regained hemolytic activity. These data show that intracellular methicillin selection facilitates isolation of mutations in genes required for intracellular growth and strengthens the premise that listeriolysin O is essential for intracellular growth.\r"

We have shown that a peptide derived from the second complementarity-determining region of the monoclonal antibody 87.92.6 light-chain variable region can reproduce both of these effects. We were also able to demonstrate specific amino acid residues and structural features involved in producing these effects.

  ".W": "After sublethal (6 Gy) whole-body irradiation, the C57BL/Ba (Thy-1.1) murine thymus regenerated in two waves, on days 3-10 and 25-32, separated by a severe relapse. The second phase of depletion-reconstitution reproduced the first one, in a less synchronous manner. The depletion affected all cell subsets, but CD4+ CD8- cells decreased later than immature cells. Cell proliferation, measured by BrdUrd incorporation, started on day 3 after irradiation and concerned CD4- CD8-, CD4- CD8+, and CD4+ CD8+ cells, sequentially. CD4+ CD8- cells never represented a significant percentage of cycling cells. When irradiation was immediately followed by an intrathymic injection of 10(5) C57BL/Ka (Thy-1.2) bone marrow cells, the relapse in thymus reconstitution was no longer observed. Detected with anti-Thy-1.2 antibodies, donor cells started cycling on day 14 and showed only one wave of proliferation. In these chimeras, recipient thymocytes behave exactly like thymocytes of solely irradiated mice. Intrathymically transferred CD4- CD8- thymocytes (10(5] showed the same proliferation kinetics as endogenous cells, with a peak in number on day 10 but completely disappeared from the thymus on days 14-21. These data reflect maturational differences between intrathymic and bone marrow precursor cells and suggest different radiosensitivities not linked to proliferative status. The resting state of the thymus immigrants was shown by the absence of Thy-1 acquisition by bone marrow cells continuously labeled for 10 days with BrdUrd in vivo before intrathymic transfer. When such labeled bone marrow cells were injected in the thymus, only the minor BrdUrd- subset gave rise to Thy-1+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "Human pre-B cells, which produce immunoglobulin heavy chain but do not produce immunoglobulin light chain, are shown to contain a 1-kilobase transcript homologous to immunoglobulin lambda light-chain genes. Detailed analysis of RNA and cDNA clones derived from these transcripts reveals that they originate from the distinct immunoglobulin lambda-like genes 14.1/16.1. Sequence analysis of these clones reveals a long open reading frame, beginning with an ATG, capable of encoding a protein of 214 amino acids with an unprocessed molecular weight of 22,944. The C-terminal half of this predicted protein is highly homologous to immunoglobulin lambda light-chain joining and constant region protein sequence, while the amino-terminal end does not share homology with variable regions. Unlike immunoglobulin genes, these genes do not undergo rearrangement prior to expression. Analysis of a panel of 26 hematopoietic cell lines reveals that expression of 14.1/16.1 is limited to pre-B cells and one B-cell line, which, like the pre-B cells, is surface immunoglobulin negative. Antisera raised against a peptide whose sequence was predicted from the 14.1 cDNA sequence identifies a 22-kDa protein in human pre-B cells. Immunoprecipitation of immunoglobulin mu-chain from these pre-B cells with anti-immunoglobulin mu antibody coprecipitates a 22-kDa protein, which is a candidate for the human immunoglobulin omega light-chain protein and may be the protein product of the 14.1/16.1 genes.\r"

None of 10 adenomas and only 1 of 30 carcinomas had lost expression of all HLA-A,B,C molecules. On the other hand, focal loss of an HLA-B product was seen in 2 of the adenomas, and complete losses of tumor cell HLA-A2 (in 7 of 13 cases), HLA-Bw4 (in 4 of 13 cases), and HLA-A3 (in 1 of 6 cases) were seen in the carcinomas. No complete losses of HLA-A1 (in 6 cases) or HLA-Bw6 (in 22 cases) occurred in the carcinomas. In addition, 1 of 20 adenocarcinomas totally lacked lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3. Because a loss of tumor cell HLA-A,B,C antigen or lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 could be selected for through an advantage in escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte attack, our results suggest that immunoselection may be a more important mechanism in tumor progression than has previously been assumed.\r"

C gamma 3, of the C gamma 3-C gamma 1-C psi epsilon 1-C alpha 1 cluster, maps 60 kb to the 3' side of C delta; C gamma 2 of the C gamma 2-C gamma 4-C epsilon-C alpha 2 cluster maps 80 kb to the 3' side of C alpha 1, where C gamma 3 encodes the constant region of the immunoglobulin gamma 3 chain, C gamma 1 encodes the constant region of the immunoglobulin gamma 1 chain, etc. C psi gamma maps 35 kb to the 3' side of C alpha 1 and is in the same transcriptional orientation as the other genes. Although in the cloned DNA many CpG-containing restriction sites were identified, most of these were methylated in peripheral blood leukocytes. The sites that were not methylated were predominantly found in three clusters, or Hpa I tiny fragment islands. One was found on the 5' side of C mu; the other two lie 30 kb to the 3' side of each of the C alpha genes and could indicate the presence of regulatory sequences or genes. A region showing strong linkage disequilibrium between all C gamma genes spans at least 160 kb. The 70-kb C mu-C gamma 3 region, however, shows no linkage disequilibrium, possibly indicating a recombination hot spot. The immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region has been almost entirely cloned and mapped, and thus most rearrangements occurring in this region should be detectable.\r"

Injections of neutralizing monoclonal antibody against recombinant murine interferon gamma, not later than 4 days after infection, markedly reduced the incidence of ECM and the elevation in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor. This treatment prevented the cerebral lesions (plugging of brain vessels by monocytes, lymphocytes, and parasitized erythrocytes). In contrast, the extent of macrophage infiltration in lymphoid organs (which is a characteristic feature of mice developing ECM), as well as the course of infection, remained unaffected by the antibody treatment. Protected mice died at a later time of severe anemia and overwhelming parasitemia, the usual outcome of P. berghei infection in mice that are not susceptible to ECM. The present data indicate that interferon gamma constitutes an important link in the cytokine network that leads to brain vessel inflammation in experimental malaria. It is proposed that interferon gamma released by activated CD4+ T cells acts by augmenting both production and action of tumor necrosis factor.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4) has been shown to induce lipopolysaccharide-activated murine B cells to differentiate into IgE-secreting cells and to stimulate IgE secretion by cultured human peripheral blood lymphoid cells. It is unclear, however, whether this effect of IL-4 on human peripheral blood lymphoid cells is a direct effect on the B cell because IL-4 can stimulate T cells and monocytes as well as B cells and does not induce purified human B cells to secrete immunoglobulin. To investigate this issue we studied the ability of IL-4 to induce IgE secretion by purified human B cells (93-96% CD20+, less than 1% CD3+) that were cultured with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Although B cells cultured with IL-4 alone did not secrete Ig and B cells cultured with EBV alone secreted IgM, IgG, and IgA but less than 150 pg of IgE per ml, the combination of EBV and IL-4 induced an IgE response that ranged from 11.4 to 40.3 ng/ml of culture supernatant after 26 days of culture. While IL-4 also enhanced IgM, IgG, and IgA secretion, as well as proliferation by EBV-infected B cells, these effects were less pronounced, occurred earlier during culture, and required a lower concentration of IL-4 than did the stimulation of IgE secretion. Furthermore, interferon gamma at 10 units per ml was found to inhibit IL-4/EBV-induced IgE secretion without inhibiting the other stimulatory effects of IL-4. We conclude that (i) IL-4 and interferon gamma can act directly on polyclonally activated human B cells to respectively stimulate and suppress IgE secretion and (ii) IL-4, in addition to its specific effect on IgE secretion, has a general stimulatory effect on the growth and differentiation of EBV-infected human B cells.\r"

Near quantitative recovery of protein and activity permitted an assessment of the contribution of each species to the overall respiratory-burst-independent antimicrobial capacity of the cell. Three uncharacterized polypeptides were discovered, including two broad-spectrum antibiotics. One of these, a defensin that we have designated human neutrophil antimicrobial peptide 4, was more potent than previously described defensins but represented less than 1% of the total protein. The other, named azurocidin, was abundant and comparable to bactericidal permeability-increasing factor in its contribution to the killing of Escherichia coli.\r"

Antisera raised to synthetic peptides corresponding to peptides Ia and Ib labeled all the bovine tau polypeptides recognized by other monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to bovine tau. Antisera to peptide Ib did not label any mouse tau polypeptides; however, an anti-Ia antiserum labeled two of the four mouse tau polypeptides. Antisera to both peptides labeled paired helical filaments (PHF) as neurofibrillary tangles, plaque neurites, and neuropil threads in Alzheimer disease brain and PHF polypeptides on immunoblots. Immunostaining with anti-Ia antisera of PHF in tissue sections and PHF polypeptides, but not bovine tau, on immunoblots was markedly increased when pretreated with alkaline phosphatase. These studies suggest that (i) the amino acid sequences of some isoforms of tau peptide might be different from that predicted from cDNAs, (ii) a tau peptide that is absent in the predicted sequences is present in PHF in Alzheimer disease, and (iii) tau in PHF is abnormally phosphorylated.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether HVPC has an inhibitory effect on growth in vitro of three bacterial species--Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa--commonly isolated from open wounds. Following exposure to HVPC, the measured zone of inhibition of bacterial growth was not significantly different between bacterial species. Inhibition at the anode (positive pole) occurred secondary to build-up of toxic end products, and inhibition at the cathode (negative pole) resulted from exposure to HVPC. Duration of exposure and voltage showed a highly significant linear relationship. Exposure to more than 250 V of HVPC for at least two hours resulted in some degree of inhibition of growth in all three bacterial species.\r"

Drainage gastrostomies were ready for use immediately after the procedure, whereas use of feeding gastrostomies started on average within 2 days of tube insertion. There were no major complications or deaths related to the procedure. Percutaneous gastrostomy is a simple and safe procedure even when large-caliber catheters are used, and it does not require gastric fixation to the abdominal wall to prevent spillage into the peritoneum.\r"

The authors compared the cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images of 53 patients with NF-1 and 11 with NF-2. In the NF-1 group, MR imaging revealed 19 patients with optic gliomas and eight with parenchymal gliomas. In 32 patients, foci of prolonged T2, similar to those reported previously as hamartomas, were identified in the cerebellar peduncles, globus pallidus, midbrain, and other locations. The frequency of these foci was related to both age and the presence of optic gliomas. In the NF-2 group, MR imaging revealed eight patients with cranial nerve schwannomas and six with meningiomas (in addition to acoustic schwannomas in all 11). These findings demonstrate that NF-1 and NF-2 are different diseases requiring different imaging protocols. NF-1 seems to be associated with tumors of astrocytes and neurons and NF-2 with tumors of meninges and Schwann cells.\r"

Arenaviruses have two viral RNA species. The smaller RNA species (S) codes for the viral nucleoprotein (N protein) and for the viral glycoprotein species (G1 and G2, which are derived from a precursor glycoprotein, GPC). The S RNA has an ambisense arrangement. The proteins are translated from subgenomic mRNA species (viz., N protein from a viral-complementary mRNA and glycoprotein from a viral-sense mRNA). The larger arenavirus RNA species (L) is presumed to code for the viral transcriptase/replicase. Phleboviruses and nairoviruses are members of the Bunyaviridae. They both have three species of viral RNA. Other than the sizes of the viral proteins and the viral RNA species, virtually nothing is known about the coding strategy of nairoviruses. Phleboviruses have an ambisense coding arrangement to their smallest (S) RNA species. This S RNA codes for the viral N protein (translated from a viral-complementary mRNA) and a nonstructural protein (translated from a viral-sense mRNA). The middle-size (M) RNA of phleboviruses codes for a precursor to the viral glycoproteins (translated from a viral-complementary mRNA). The largest viral RNA (L) is presumed to code for the viral transcriptase/replicase.\r"

Most hemorrhagic fever viruses are zoonoses, with the possible exception of the four dengue viruses, which may continually circulate among humans. Hemorrhagic fever viruses are found in both temperate and tropical habitats and generally infect both sexes and all ages, although the age and sex of those infected are frequently influenced by the possibility of occupational exposure. Transmission to humans is frequently by bite of an infected tick or mosquito or via aerosol from infected rodent hosts. Aerosol and nosocomial transmission are especially important with Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg, and Ebola viruses. Seasonality of hemorrhagic fever among humans is influenced for the most part by the dynamics of infected arthropod or vertebrate hosts. Mammals, especially rodents, appear to be important natural hosts for many hemorrhagic fever viruses. The transmission cycle for each hemorrhagic fever virus is distinct and is dependent upon the characteristics of the primary vector species and the possibility for its contact with humans.\r"

In some patients titers of IgG increased markedly between 2 and 4 months after onset of illness and remained readily demonstrable by indirect immunofluorescence 3 years after infection. Endogenous antibody response was demonstrated in only two of 15 patients who died of infection. Techniques for demonstrating antibody were (in order of decreasing sensitivity) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reversed passive hemagglutination-inhibition, indirect immunofluorescence, fluorescent-focus reduction, complement-fixation, and immunodiffusion. Most patients developed relatively low levels of neutralizing antibodies (range, 1:8 to 1:32 by fluorescent-focus reduction tests), but some developed titers of 1:256 to 1:512. Plasma intended for therapeutic use should be selected on the basis of its neutralizing ability.\r"

Dengue infection in vivo is restricted to monocytes; however, it is unknown if dengue-infected monocytes undergo alterations in the production of PA, PAI, and PCA. This issue was addressed in studies in which monocytes were infected in vitro with dengue 2 virus in serum-free medium in the presence of enhancing antibody. No urokinase activity was detected in either control or infected cells or in their supernatants. Infection of monocytes with dengue 2 virus resulted in an almost threefold increase in PAI activity in cells and supernatants. No change in relation to the control was observed in PCA generated by the infected cells. These data indicate that dengue 2 infection enhances the production of PAI from monocytes without altering PA or PCA.\r"

The molecular basis of this hyperpolarization has been investigated by examining the properties of single K+ channels in arterial smooth muscle cells. The presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels in these cells was demonstrated at the single channel level. These channels were opened by the hyperpolarizing vasodilator cromakalim and inhibited by the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker glibenclamide. Furthermore, in arterial rings the vasorelaxing actions of the drugs diazoxide, cromakalim, and pinacidil and the hyperpolarizing actions of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and acetylcholine were blocked by inhibitors of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, suggesting that all these agents may act through a common pathway in smooth muscle by opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels.\r"

These data constitute experimental evidence that an RNA enzyme, like a protein enzyme, has an interior and an exterior. Determination of positions where the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA is on the inside or on the outside of the molecule provides major constraints for modeling the three-dimensional structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme.

In ischemic gerbils with vehicle administration, the average neuronal densities were 13 +/- 2, 14 +/- 2, 13 +/- 2, and 13 +/- 1 for piroxicam, flurbiprofen, AA-861, and BW-755C, respectively. The average neuronal densities in ischemic gerbils treated with 1.5 and 10 mg/kg piroxicam and 1.5 and 10 mg/kg flurbiprofen were 13 +/- 2, 194 +/- 9, 19 +/- 5, and 143 +/- 12, respectively. In ischemic gerbils treated with 15 and 100 mg/kg AA-861 and 30 mg/kg BW-755C, the average neuronal densities were 12 +/- 1, 13 +/- 1, and 14 +/- 2, respectively. At their higher doses, both piroxicam and flurbiprofen significantly (p less than 0.01) ameliorated delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 sector. Our results suggest that cyclooxygenase products play an important role in the development of delayed neuronal injury after cerebral ischemia.\r"

Whole blood and platelet transfusions were used more appropriately than those of red cells, cryoprecipitate, and fresh-frozen plasma. Blood transfusions were used more appropriately in the management of acute bleeding or anemia associated with cardiovascular problems. Three groups of patients were especially prone to inappropriate transfusions: those with end-stage renal disease or terminal cancer and cancer patients on chemotherapy. Age, sex, and specific hospital wards were not associated with inappropriate use. Most unjustified episodes occurred as a result of the overestimation of the immediate risk incurred by withholding transfusion.\r"

The average decrease in prostate size measured by ultrasound was 45 percent after six months with concomitant improvement in the obstructive symptoms of prostatism. There was a steady decline in serum PSA levels which paralleled the decrease in prostate size. One patient who discontinued treatment after six months demonstrated both a regrowth of his prostate and a rise in serum PSA levels to pretreatment levels four months post-discontinuation of treatment. We conclude that treatment with a GnRH analogue caused reversible involution of prostatic epithelial cells with parallel effects on serum PSA levels. Consideration of the initial prostate size together with the serum PSA levels can help predict the response to medical castration in men with BPH.\r"

The cause of these abnormalities is uncertain, but they are thought to represent a form of chronic rejection. The chest radiographs and medical records of 11 transplantation patients with proved bronchiolitis obliterans were reviewed retrospectively. A pathologic diagnosis was made by open-lung biopsy (five patients), transbronchial biopsy (three patients), and autopsy (two patients). Clinical criteria alone were used for diagnosis in one patient. In all patients, the chest radiographs showed parenchymal abnormalities consisting of linear-nodular, nodular, confluent nodular, or diffuse alveolar opacities. Radiographic evidence of central bronchiectasis was present in nine of the 11 patients. This feature was not present on chest radiographs of five randomly selected asymptomatic transplant patients. We conclude that the parenchymal lung changes in bronchiolitis obliterans in transplant patients are nonspecific and are radiographically indistinguishable from other infectious and noninfectious complications. The presence of central bronchiectasis (nine of the 11 patients) may be a distinctive radiographic finding in this group of patients.\r"

Time from infarct symptom onset to coronary bypass surgery was 7.3 +/- 1.9 hours for 24 patients operated upon on an emergency basis and 9.3 +/- 5.2 days for 58 patients having late in-hospital surgery. There were no operative deaths and five in-hospital deaths in the surgical group, all of which occurred in patients with preoperative cardiogenic shock. Although patients in the surgical group were older (59.7 +/- 10.4 years versus 54.9 +/- 10.2 years; p = 0.03), had more extensive coronary artery disease (42% three-vessel disease versus 11%; p = 0.001), and had a higher incidence of anterior wall myocardial infarction (48% versus 39%; p = 0.02), in-hospital mortality for the surgical group (6%) was similar to that in 301 patients not undergoing surgery (7%) in this trial. For patients discharged from the hospital, mortality at 1 year was 2.5% in the surgical group and 1.8% in patients not having coronary bypass surgery before hospital discharge. At a 1 year follow-up, there were no significant differences in the frequency of cardiac or noncardiac-related hospitalizations or in event-free survival between surgical and nonsurgical groups. The majority of patients in both groups considered themselves to be in excellent or good condition. Coronary bypass surgery can be performed with low morbidity and mortality rates in close temporal association to acute myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, vasopressin, aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and plasma renin activity were measured before, immediately after, and 30 minutes and 18 to 24 hours following balloon inflation in 18 patients. Mean right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures were 6 and 18 mm Hg before inflations, respectively, and were unchanged after balloon inflations (5 and 13 mm Hg, respectively). Systemic systolic/diastolic pressures were 139 +/- 8/65 +/- 4 mm Hg before occlusion, decreased to 47 +/- 5/34 +/- 3 mm Hg during occlusion, and returned to baseline after occlusions. Baseline atrial natriuretic peptide levels were 267 +/- 43 pg/ml and increased to 513 +/- 71 pg/ml after balloon inflations. Vasopressin levels before occlusion were 9.1 +/- 2.2 pg/ml and increased to 21.4 +/- 4.8 pg/ml after balloon inflations. Plasma renin activity was 5.4 +/- 1.4 ng/ml/hr before inflations and was not significantly changed after balloon inflations. No clinically significant changes in plasma sodium, potassium, creatinine, and osmolality were observed after the procedure. Aldosterone increased from 23 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 7 ng/dl 10 minutes after the last inflation. Plasma ACTH measured in seven patients with increased aldosterone was 28 +/- 8 pg/ml before and increased to 295 +/- 157 pg/ml 10 minutes after balloon inflations. The increases in natriuretic peptide and vasopressin were likely due to elevated intracardiac and decreased arterial pressures, respectively; they persisted in spite of no clinically significant changes in filling pressures 12 to 24 hours after the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No significant group differences were observed for hematocrit or plasma growth hormone. Results of this study indicate that 1) energy restriction did not seem to modify the protein requirement for weight maintenance and 2) animals fed low-protein diets, even in the face of growth failure, have a mechanism for wasting energy.\r"

Three HDL subclasses were isolated by heparin-affinity chromatography: HDL containing no apo E (HDL-E0), HDL with a moderate amount of apo E (HDL-E1), and HDL highly enriched in apo E (HDL-E2). The plasma levels of total HDL cholesterol and protein were markedly decreased in ZD. The decreases were due primarily to a significant decline in circulating HDL-E0 particles. The percent content of free cholesterol in HDL-E2 was increased in ZD compared with PF and CT. Zn deficiency decreased the plasma concentrations of apo A-I and apo C of HDL-E0 and total apo E associated with HDL-E1 and HDL-E2. The mechanisms for such changes await further investigation.\r"

Unloading of low-pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptors (CPBR) was accomplished by application of low levels (-10 and -20 mm Hg) of lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The authors measured the plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine, the mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the forearm vascular resistance (FVR) responses to reflex sympathetic activation by LBNP. ANP infusion (0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1) decreased (p less than 0.01) basal MAP, as well as plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels (p less than 0.05). ANP infusion also reduced (p less than 0.01) plasma NE responses to both levels of LBNP and tended to decrease both epinephrine and FVR during ANP infusion at -20 mm Hg LBNP (p = 0.8). These data suggest that exogenous ANP inhibits the reflex sympathetic responses that occur with CPBR unloading. The blunted plasma NE responses to CPBR unloading parallel the attenuation of FVR response to LBNP during ANP infusion, despite significant LBNP-induced hypotension.\r"

  ".U": "89320482\r", 
  ".W": "Interest in the mechanism of impaired salt and water metabolism in hypothyroidism has led to growing evidence of an interaction between atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the thyroid, which includes reports of direct effects of thyroid hormone on ANP synthesis and circulating ANP levels, and of the presence of specific ANP receptors in human thyroid tissue, which may act to inhibit thyroglobulin (Tg) secretion. The authors questioned whether or not thyrotropin (TSH) has a role in this interaction. They used 125I-ANP to study the effect of TSH on ANP binding to human thyroid cells in primary culture. Binding competition by increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANP in the presence or absence of TSH was assessed by Scatchard analysis. At lower temperatures of 4 degrees C or 23 degrees C, TSH had no effect either on the ANP receptor equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) or number of binding sites. However, at 37 degrees C, bovine TSH at 1 mU/ml reduced measurable binding sites by about 50% without affecting receptor affinity (Kd = 0.2 nM). Prolonged (6 days) coincubation of TSH with thyroid cells decreased the assayable ANP receptor. The effects of TSH appear to be specific because human luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulatory hormone, growth hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin and iodide had no effect on ANP binding. Thus, human thyroid cells possess a single class of high-affinity, specific receptors for ANP with binding activity that is temperature dependent and modulated by TSH at physiologic temperature. TSH-mediated reduction of binding at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C suggests an energy-dependent process that acts possibly by activating an ANP degradative enzyme or by changing the rate of receptor internalization and subsequent degradation.\r"

Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common single agent associated with mucopurulent cervicitis, was isolated from 30 (47%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae from five (8%) of 64 patients. Patients were followed up for 3 months, and the effect of treatment was assessed by clinical (presence of endocervical mucopus, cervicitis severity score, and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram-stained smears of endocervical secretions) and microbiologic criteria. Doxycycline and amoxicillin were equally effective for treating chlamydial and nonchlamydial cervicitis. However, endocervical mucopus was still present in 18% of the patients in both treatment groups after 2 months and in 23% of the doxycycline group and 33% of the amoxicillin group after 3 months of therapy. The cause of persistent/recurrent mucopus after antimicrobial treatment was not explained by relapse or reinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, genital mycoplasmas, or Gardnerella vaginalis, but persistence was associated with the degree of cervical ectopy.\r"

Treatment (5 mg/da intramuscularly for 3 consecutive days) on day (n = 8) after the midcycle peak in estradiol levels in mated animals induced a premature drop in plasma progesterone levels and shortened the ovarian cycle length. Treatment on day 20 (n = 5) or day 40 (n = 5) induced a drop in progesterone levels and decidual collapse. In three animals treated on day 40, vaginal bleeding was observed within 46 hours of the initiation of treatment. Treatment on day 80 resulted in expulsion of the fetuses with a mean induction abortion interval of 39 hours (range, 20 to 48 hours). The progesterone antagonistic effects of ZK 98.734 could be a result of the decrease in progesterone synthesis by the corpus luteum and/or placenta in addition to the interference with the progesterone binding to its cellular receptors in the target organ. Our study suggests that ZK 98.734 has potential for fertility regulation. Clinical trials for postcoital contraception, induction of menstruation, and early abortifacient effects are warranted.\r"

On the basis of specific indications, these women were treated by vaporization, excisional conization, or combination conization procedure. The evolution of methodology for each laser technique was based on specific pathophysiology and long-term observation of results. A total of 3070 patients underwent vaporization, 2881 of whom had no evidence of disease after one laser exposure (93.8%). Of the 954 patients who had laser excisional procedures, 925 (97%) had no evidence of disease. The most common complications observed were intraoperative and postoperative bleeding; however, sutures were required in only 1.34% of the latter. The risks of cervical stenosis (1.1%), incompetent cervix (0%), and pelvic infection (0.05%) were very low. This 10-year study demonstrated that the CO2 laser was a highly effective method for treating cervical epithelial neoplasia and had the added benefit of preserving reproductive function and anatomic integrity.\r"

External costs stem from additional payments received by sedentary individuals from collectively financed programs such as health insurance, sick-leave coverage, disability insurance, and group life insurance. Those with sedentary life-styles incur higher medical costs, but their life expectancy at age 20 is 10 months less so they collect less public and private pensions. The pension costs come late in life, as do some of the medical costs, and so the estimate of the external cost is sensitive to the discount rate used. At a 5 percent rate of discount, the lifetime subsidy from others to those with a sedentary life style is $1,900. Our estimate of the subsidy is also sensitive to the assumed effect of exercise on mortality. The subsidy is a rationale for public support of recreational facilities such as parks and swimming pools and employer support of programs to increase exercise.\r"

Esophageal and forestomach P-450 levels were increased in the ethanol-fed rats. The ethanol diet also produced a small but significant increase in esophageal glutathione transferase levels. Glutathione levels and UDPGT activity were unaffected. Since P-450 is directly involved in the activation of many chemical carcinogens, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in upper alimentary tract cancer risk associated with alcohol abuse is due, at least in part, to ethanol's altering the balance between carcinogen activation and detoxification.\r"

Computerized reaction tests measuring errors and reaction time, as well as clinical testing and a self evaluation (modified Osgood test) were performed before, 75, 150, and 225 min after ethanol intake. TRH treatment did not influence blood ethanol concentrations. The effect of ethanol to produce errors was substantially reduced in all three reaction tests after TRH treatment compared to placebo treatment. The reaction times were slightly increased in simple and four choice reaction tests and up to 20% increased in a complex test in the TRH-ethanol situation compared to the placebo-ethanol situation. The effects caused by ethanol were also significantly reduced in three clinical tests and in two subjective tests of inebriation by TRH treatment compared to placebo treatment. In conclusion the study demonstrated that several acute effects of ethanol intake in humans were reduced by TRH pretreatment which did not interfere with the blood ethanol concentration versus time curve.\r"

To document the role of cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism in the pathogenesis of heaves, we measured plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid concentrations of metabolites of thromboxane (TX)A2 and prostaglandins (PG) I2 and D2 in five affected ponies and their age- and gender-matched controls prior to and during acute airway obstruction precipitated by housing the ponies in a barn and exposing them to hay dust. Pulmonary resistance increased significantly and dynamic compliance and arterial oxygen tension decreased significantly in affected ponies that were placed in the barn. At this time, histamine aerosol challenge demonstrated the presence of airway hyperresponsiveness in the affected ponies. Plasma TXB2 was the only metabolite that increased significantly during the acute disease state. In a subsequent experiment, the ponies were treated with flunixin meglumine, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to determine if this would alter the onset or development of clinical disease. At a dose of 1.1 mg/kg intramuscularly, 3 times daily, flunixin meglumine inhibited TXB2 production but did not alter the degree of airway obstruction or airway hyperreactivity measured at pasture and in the barn. We conclude that cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism are altered but do not play a role in the airway obstruction and hyperreactivity observed in ponies with heaves.\r"

We measured the 4-h pulmonary clearance of 10(4) and 10(6) rough and smooth Pseudomonas after intrabronchial inoculation. After 10(4) Pseudomonas, rough strains were cleared more efficiently than smooth strains (89 +/- 13% versus 140 +/- 19% of the original inoculum, respectively, p less than 0.05). This was associated with more total bronchoalveolar lavage PMNs after inoculation with rough as compared with smooth Pseudomonas (1.60 +/- 0.38 x 10(5) versus 0.55 +/- 0.09 x 10(5), respectively, p less than 0.05). After inoculation with 10(6) Pseudomonas, rough were cleared less efficiently than smooth Pseudomonas (380 +/- 45% versus 134 +/- 12% of the original inoculum, respectively, p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the BAL PMNs of the animals inoculated with either bacterial strain at this inoculum (8.1 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) and 9.4 +/- 1.0 x 10(5) for the rough and smooth Pseudomonas, respectively). When PMN differences were abolished in C5-deficient mice, 10(4) rough were cleared less efficiently than smooth Pseudomonas. The relatively poor clearance of rough Pseudomonas could not be explained by in vitro differences in PMN killing or BAL toxicity or by intrinsic growth rates.\r"

The results were compared to those obtained from 10 normal women of comparable age and stature. Testing was performed 2 to 37 months after H-LT (median, 7.5 months). Cardiac function was normal in all H-LT recipients. None of the patients had spirometric evidence of airway obstruction, while six had a restrictive pattern with forced vital capacities less than 80% of predicted values. Resting minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), and ventilatory drive (VT/TI) in the H-LT recipients were not significantly different from those of the normal subjects. Inspiratory time (TI), however, was significantly shorter in the H-LT patients (1.64 +/- 0.2 versus 2.09 +/- 0.13 s, p = 0.035), and resting breathing frequency (F) tended to be greater in the H-LT recipients (16.27 +/- 2.04 versus 12.82 +/- 0.53 breaths/min, p = 0.052). The overall ventilatory response to hypercapnia was reduced after H-LT (0.91 +/- 0.17 versus 1.5 +/- 0.27 L/min/mm Hg CO2, p less than 0.043), as was the F response (0.2 +/- 0.09 versus 0.65 +/- 0.13 breaths/min/mm Hg CO2, p less than 0.01). The VT and VT/TI responses to hypercapnia did not differ between the H-LT recipients and normal subjects.

Four of the H-LT patients had a restrictive pattern on spirometry. The time since transplantation ranged from 45 to 1,102 days. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to total sleep time or distribution of sleep stages.

Across wakefulness and all sleep stages, the H-LT patients tended to have shorter total respiratory cycle times (Ttot) (p = 0.052) and more rapid breathing frequency (F) than the normal subjects. This was associated with significantly shorter inspiratory times (Tl) (p less than 0.001) and smaller duty cycles (Tl/Ttot) (p less than 0.005) in the H-LT recipients. During non-REM and REM sleep, F tended to be higher in the H-LT recipients with pulmonary restriction than in the nonrestricted patients.

  ".W": "Acute denervation of the lungs occurs after heart-lung transplantation (HLT), affecting both afferent and efferent nerves below the tracheal anastomosis. After surgery, the carina and main bronchi are perfused by mediastinal collaterals derived from the coronary arteries, and the intrapulmonary airways by retrograde blood flow from pulmonary artery collaterals. During acute rejection, the lungs are subjected to inflammation, particularly perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Rejection can be diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy (TBB). We report the bronchial responses to inhaled methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (USNDW) in 16 HLT patients 2 wk to 43 months after surgery, relating them to the lung histopathology from concurrent TBB. Methacholine bronchial hyperresponsiveness was common, but it was not associated with airway epithelial or submucosal inflammation or perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. Six patients had a modest response to USNDW (fall in FEV1 greater than 10%). The responsiveness to USNDW was not associated with enhanced methacholine responsiveness or epithelial and mucosal inflammation. However, it was more commonly seen in patients with lung rejection and perivascular infiltrates. Methacholine hyperresponsiveness in HLT patients could therefore reflect denervation hypersensitivity of airway smooth muscle muscarinic receptors. The modest response to USNDW in some patients cannot be a result of a vagal reflex but could reflect a pathologic vascular response associated with lung rejection. These observations offer insight into the possible mechanisms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in disease.\r"

Here we report the cough frequency, during inhalation of ultrasonically nebulized distilled water, of 15 heart-lung transplant patients studied 6 wk to 36 months after surgery. They were compared with 15 normal subjects of a similar age and sex. The distribution of the aerosol was studied in five normal subjects using 99mtechnetium diethylene triamine pentaacetate (99mTc-DTPA) in saline. In seven patients, the sensitivity of the laryngeal mucosa to instilled distilled water (0.2 ml) was tested at the time of fiberoptic bronchoscopy by recording the cough response. Ten percent of the aerosol was deposited onto the larynx and trachea, 56% on the central airways, and 34% in the periphery of the lung. The cough response to the aerosol was strikingly diminished in the patients compared with normal subjects (p less than 0.001), but all seven patients coughed when distilled water was instilled onto the larynx. As expected, the laryngeal mucosa of heart-lung transplant patients remains sensitive to distilled water. However, the diminished coughing when the distilled water is distributed by aerosol to the central airways supports the view that vagal afferent nerves do not reinnervate the lungs after heart-lung transplantation, up to 36 months after surgery.\r"

The clinical and physiologic observations made at the time of episodes of infection and rejection together with the histopathology of lung tissue obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy were compared with pre- and postepisode chest radiographs. There were 45 episodes of rejection in 20 patients: 23 episodes during the first month after transplantation, and 22 after 1 month. Twenty-six episodes of infection occurred in 15 patients. The causative organisms included Aspergillus fumigatus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex, Pneumocystis carinii, and Staphylococcus aureus. When an abnormal chest radiograph is common during the first month after transplantation during acute rejection (74%), it may alternatively be due to lung infection (most commonly CMV pneumonitis). The chest radiograph during this period provides a useful indication for transbronchial biopsy and bronchial lavage. The chest radiograph is abnormal in the minority (23%) of episodes of rejection occurring later than 1 month after transplantation. Pulmonary function tests (FEV1 and VC) offered a more useful indication for transbronchial biopsy during this period.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the endothelium on pulmonary venular responses to reduced oxygen tension has not been defined. To examine this question, endothelial injury was induced in small guinea pig pulmonary artery and venule segments (effective lumen radius, 174 +/- 5 and 122 +/- 2 microns, respectively) by perfusion with either a mixture of hypoxanthine (5 mM) and xanthine oxidase (0.05 U/ml) (HX/XO) or collagenase (2 mg/ml). HX/XO significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the relaxation of precontracted pulmonary arteries by acetylcholine (ACH), bradykinin (BK), and A-23187, and the relaxations were restored by including superoxide dismutase (40 micrograms/ml) in the HX/XO solution. However, neither HX/XO nor collagenase affected vasodilation induced by ACH, BK, and A-23187 in precontracted pulmonary venules. In contrast, HX/XO significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented the sustained contraction of pulmonary venules to hypoxia (HX/XO, 3.2 +/- 1.0 mg/mm; control, 1.0 +/- 0.5 mg/mm) and anoxia (HX/XO, 35.1 +/- 6.6 mg/mm; control, 20.3 +/- 4.0 mg/mm). Collagenase also significantly (p less than 0.05) enhanced the anoxic contractions (collagenase, 36.0 +/- 3.7 mg/mm; control, 20.9 +/- 6.8 mg/mm). Superoxide dismutase (40 micrograms/ml) and catalase (323 micrograms/ml) abolished HX-XO-induced augmentation of the hypoxic and anoxic contractions of pulmonary venules. Collagenase removed 54 +/- 8% of the venular endothelium (control, 5 +/- 1%), whereas HX/XO-exposed endothelial cells contained numerous craters. Neither gossypol (5 microM) nor methylene blue (10 microM) affected pulmonary venular contractions to reduced PO2. Endothelial damage augments the PO2-dependent contractions of the pulmonary venule, and this augmentation does not appear to be due to decreased release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

The accumulation of these T-cells may be related to the ability of sarcoid alveolar macrophages to present antigen and stimulate lymphocyte proliferation in an exaggerated fashion. In the context that HLA Class II gene (HLA-DR, DQ, and DP) expression is essential to the interaction of lymphocytes with antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, we have evaluated the hypothesis that the expression of Class II genes may be up-regulated in sarcoid alveolar macrophages. Northern blot and dot blot analysis with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for HLA-DR, DQ, and DP genes revealed that both normal and sarcoid alveolar macrophages contain Class II mRNA transcripts, but that the levels in sarcoid and normal alveolar macrophages are similar (p greater than 0.3, all comparisons). Furthermore, evaluation of surface expression of Class II molecules with monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that alveolar macrophages of both patients with sarcoidosis and normal subjects express all three Class II molecules, DR, DQ, and DP, but there were no significant differences between sarcoid patients and normal subjects in the proportions of macrophages expressing these surface molecules. However, there was a significantly higher surface density of Class II molecules on sarcoid alveolar macrophages (p less than 0.05, all comparisons sarcoid to normal).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 18 patients treated at a single institution between 1978 and 1984. PATIENTS: All 18 women had abdominal carcinomatosis and had no primary site identified at laparotomy. Nine patients had limited residual tumor (maximal tumor diameter, 3 cm or less) after initial cytoreductive surgery, and 9 patients had extensive residual disease. INTERVENTIONS: In general, patients were treated according to standard guidelines for treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. All patients had initial laparotomy with attempted cytoreduction; of these 18 patients, 16 subsequently received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients were restaged either clinically (10 patients) or with second-look surgery (8 patients). RESULTS: The median survival for all patients was 23 months. Five patients had complete response to chemotherapy, and three patients remain disease-free 41, 59, and 77 months after diagnosis. Patients with limited residual disease had longer median survival than did those with extensive residual disease (31 months compared with 11 months). CONCLUSIONS: Women with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site involving predominantly the peritoneal surface should be distinguished from other patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site because they have a more indolent disease course, a higher response rate to systemic therapy, and a chance for long-term, disease-free survival after therapy. Although optimal treatment is undefined, we recommend that these patients be treated using the guidelines established for therapy of advanced ovarian carcinoma, including initial surgical cytoreduction followed by cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if circulating CD4+ lymphocyte counts are predictive of specific infectious or neoplastic processes causing pulmonary dysfunction. DESIGN: Retrospective, consecutive sample study. SETTING: Referral-based clinic and wards. PATIENTS: We studied 100 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had had 119 episodes of pulmonary dysfunction within 60 days after CD4 lymphocyte determinations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating CD4 counts were less than 0.200 X 10(9) cells/L (200 cells/mm3) before 46 of 49 episodes of pneumocystis pneumonia, 8 of 8 episodes of cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and 7 of 7 episodes and 19 of 21 episodes of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, respectively. In contrast, circulating CD4 counts before episodes of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia were quite variable: Of 41 episodes, 11 occurred when CD4 counts were greater than 0.200 X 10(9) cells/L. The percent of circulating lymphocytes that were CD4+ had a predictive value equal to that of CD4 counts. Serum p24 antigen levels had no predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumocystis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and pulmonary infection caused by C. neoformans or M. avium-intracellulare are unlikely to occur in HIV-infected patients who have had a CD4 count above 0.200 to 0.250 X 10(9) cells/L (200 to 250 cells/mm3) or a CD4 percent above 20% to 25% in the 60 days before pulmonary evaluation. Patients infected with HIV who have a CD4 count below 0.200 X 10(9) cells/L (or less than 20% CD4 cells) are especially likely to benefit from antipneumocystis prophylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "A persistent suppression of bacterial growth following a brief exposure to an antibiotic (postantibiotic effect [( PAE]) has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. If a PAE is present in vivo, antibiotic levels in tissue at the site of infection may decrease below the MIC without bacterial regrowth in the latter portion of the dosing interval. In the present studies, a PAE was sought in vitro and in vivo for penicillin G plus gentamicin versus Enterococcus faecalis. The studies demonstrated that increasing concentrations of gentamicin caused an increased rate of bactericidal action and an increasingly prolonged PAE in vitro. The combination of penicillin and gentamicin, in addition to more rapid killing, exhibited a more prolonged PAE than did penicillin alone. However, unlike these in vitro findings, no PAE could be demonstrated in vivo in rats with experimental left-sided enterococcal endocarditis treated with penicillin plus gentamicin. This suggests that antibiotic vegetation levels should be maintained above the MIC throughout the dosing interval to prevent loss of efficacy as a result of bacterial regrowth.\r"

  ".W": "Chancroid is gaining importance as a sexually transmitted disease because of its association with transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Effective, simply administered therapy for chancroid is necessary. Fleroxacin is effective against Haemophilus ducreyi in vitro. We performed an initial randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fleroxacin for treatment of chancroid in Nairobi, Kenya. Fifty-three men with culture-positive chancroid were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg (group 1) or 400 mg (group 2) of fleroxacin as a single oral dose. Groups 1 and 2 were similar with regard to severity of disease, bubo formation, and HIV-1 status. A satisfactory clinical response to therapy was noted in 23 of 26 patients (88%) in group 1 and 18 of 23 patients (78%) in group 2. Bacteriological failure occurred in 1 of 26 evaluable patients (4%) in group 1 and 4 of 23 evaluable patients (17%) in group 2. Two of 37 HIV-1-seronegative men (5%) and 3 of 11 HIV-1-infected men (27%) were bacteriological failures. Fleroxacin, 200 or 400 mg as a single oral dose, is efficacious therapy for microbiologically proven chancroid in patients who do not have concurrent HIV-1 infection. Among HIV-1-infected men, a single dose of 200 or 400 mg of fleroxacin is inadequate therapy for chancroid.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms of resistance to quinolones were characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated after Tn5 insertional mutagenesis and in resistant strains that emerged during pefloxacin therapy of experimental aortic endocarditis. Quinolone resistance achieved in in vitro-selected mutants Qr-1 and Qr-2 was associated with cross-resistance to several groups of antimicrobial agents, including beta-lactams, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. A significant reduction of norfloxacin uptake was also observed. After ether permeabilization of the cells, DNA synthesis of these two isolates was as susceptible to norfloxacin as DNA synthesis of the parent strain (PAO1). These results indicate that alteration of outer membrane permeability is the primary determinant of resistance in these isolates. This altered cell permeability was correlated with reduction of outer membrane protein G (25.5 kilodaltons) and loss of a 40-kilodalton outer membrane protein in strain Qr-1. Resistance to quinolones that emerged during experimental endocarditis therapy was associated with both modification of outer membrane permeability (decreased uptake of norfloxacin) and decreased susceptibility of DNA synthesis to norfloxacin. Resistance was limited to quinolones and chloramphenicol. For these strains, norfloxacin inhibitory doses (50%) for DNA synthesis were identical to the drug MICs, suggesting that despite the identification of a permeability change, perhaps due to changes of lipopolysaccharide, the alteration of the quinolone intracellular target(s) susceptibility constitutes the primary determinant of resistance. Also, two distinct levels of norfloxacin resistance of DNA synthesis were found in these isolates, indicating that at least two distinct alterations of the drug target(s) are possible in P. aeruginosa.\r"

Based on histologic appearance of the biopsy specimens, these patients were diagnosed as having myoepithelial sialadenitis. We found oligoclonal rearrangements of the kappa gene (4 patients) and lambda gene (1 patient), and oligoclonal rearrangement of the TCAR beta chain in 2 additional SS patients. Patients with Ig gene rearrangements did not show rearrangements of their TCAR gene, nor did patients with TCAR rearrangements exhibit Ig rearrangements. The observed oligoclonal rearrangements probably derive from 5-10% of the salivary gland B cells or T cells. Three of these SS patients developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2-8 years after the initial biopsy. Our results suggest that minor populations of B cells or T cells may clonally expand in the salivary gland tissues of SS patients with pseudolymphoma, and that such lymphocyte expansions may be controlled by the endogenous immune response and/or medications. However, continued lymphoproliferation in these salivary gland tissues may eventually lead to emergence of a neoplastic clone that escapes immunologic control and develops into a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a result of a multistep process.\r"

  ".W": "As part of an ongoing prospective study of seropositive homosexual men in Vancouver, Canada, a seroprevalent cohort of 246 subjects (i.e. duration of infection unknown) and a seroincident cohort of 102 subjects (i.e. duration of infection known) were followed a median of 63 and 45 months, respectively. Follow-up with validation utilizing record linkage with the Canadian Federal Centre for AIDS registry revealed 58 and nine cases of AIDS in the seroprevalent and seroincident cohorts, respectively, through July 1988. These data yield product limit estimates of the cumulative progression rates to AIDS at 60 months of 23.0% for the seroprevalent cohort, 13.0% for the seroincident cohort, and 21.0% for the combined groups. Univariate analyses revealed the following to be statistically and clinically significant predictors of AIDS progression: low CD4 counts, low CD4/CD8 ratios, elevated immune complexes, elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, and low platelet counts. Cox regression revealed that elevated IgA levels, low CD4 counts, elevated immune complexes, two or more symptoms, and more than 20 male sexual partners in high-risk areas in the 5 years prior to enrollment were independent predictors of progression to AIDS over the subsequent 5 years. A multivariate risk function based on the latter five variables delineated low-, medium- and high-risk groups whose 5-year progression rates to AIDS were 6.7, 15.6 and 64.4%, respectively. The high-risk group contained 75% of all subjects who progressed to AIDS. Only 6% of the high-risk group would have qualified for zidovudine therapy under current guidelines at the beginning of the observation period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred and fifty-four (53.3%) were parenteral drug addicts and 100 (34.6%) were male homosexuals. Ninety-six (33.2%) presented with tuberculosis, 148 (51.2%), with other opportunistic infections, 34 (11.7%) with Kaposi's sarcoma, and the remaining 11 with a lymphoma. By February 1988, 144 (49.8%) of the 289 had died, with an actuarial survival probability of 46.7% at 2 years (40.7%-52.7%, 95% confidence interval). The factors selected by the multivariate analysis as independently worsening the prognosis were: having been diagnosed as having AIDS before 1986, being more than 45 years old, not being a parenteral drug addict and presenting with an opportunistic infection other than a tuberculosis or with a malignancy. In conclusion, some factors influencing the prognosis for AIDS patients are very dependent upon the geographical area of the series.\r"

The study population included 61 male and 16 female index cases, of whom 40 were European and 37 African. Multiple sexual partners in central Africa was the risk factor for HIV infection in 83%. The overall infection rate among the contact cases was 45%, 53% among female partners and 13% among male partners (P less than 0.001). Variables significantly associated with HIV infection in the partners included advanced clinical stage (AIDS-related complex or AIDS), a low concentration of T4 lymphocytes and African nationality of the index case, young age of the partner, and more than 50 instances of sexual contact with the index cases. In a logistic regression analysis, a low concentration of T4 lymphocytes, clinical stage ARC/AIDS and African nationality of the index case but not number of sexual contacts, remained as independent risk factors for HIV transmission. Our data indicate that there is a significant biological heterogeneity in sexual transmission of HIV and that advanced clinical stage and severe T cell depletion of the index case are major determinants of infectivity.\r"

We studied seventy-eight female sexual partners of men infected with HIV and 18 male sexual partners of infected women. Participants were interviewed concerning sexual practices, use of contraception and other risk factors for HIV infection. Fifteen out of 78 (19.2%) female partners and one out of eighteen (5.5%) male partners were seropositive for HIV antibody. All couples had practised vaginal intercourse. Seropositive female partners did not differ significantly from seronegative partners with regard to length of relationship, number of acts of vaginal intercourse, other sexual practices, stage of clinical disease in the index case, or numbers of other sexual partners in the last five years. In two women, seroconversion was documented after one act of unprotected sexual intercourse. The majority of infected female partners (eight out of 15) had sexual relationships with men who were asymptomatic and did not practice anal intercourse. Biological factors such as variability in infectivity of the index case and susceptibility of the contact, as well as behavioural variables may be important in determining transmission.\r"

HIV seroprevalence rates in the capital cities were used as indicators of the relative level of HIV infection of countries. The correlation between these two variables in 37 African countries was high (R = 0.9; P less than 0.001).

Core antigen was found to be extremely sensitive to this enzyme. By contrast, the antigenicity of the purified env antigen was not destroyed and was even increased after pepsin treatment, performed under identical conditions. These findings suggest that after pepsin digestion the core-anti-core immune complexes do not reconstitute because of the loss of antigenicity of the core antigen. By contrast, the lack of binding after neutralization to the env antigen of the F(ab')2 fragment of the anti-env antibody, cleaved by pepsin from the immune complexes, is probably due to other factors.\r"

Two patterns of IgM response were identified: a precocious IgM positivity (group of five children positive at birth) and a later appearance of IgM, always within the third month (six cases). Early p24 antigenemia occurred in one infant. Three out of four children who developed antigenemia after birth were symptomatic within the sixth month. No clinical or immunological abnormalities were found among the three children who were persistently negative for both IgM anti-HIV and p24 Ag. Serial IgM anti-HIV and p24 Ag testing may be helpful in the early identification of HIV-infected patients.\r"

The relative frequency of individuals homozygous for the allele coding for low CR1 numbers is approximately 5% of the normal population. CR1 numbers/erythrocytes are significantly decreased in symptomatic HIV-infected individuals. Decreased CR1 expression correlates with the severity of disease. The present study investigated the CR1 genomic Hind III RFLP-related polymorphism in 79 HIV-infected individuals and 84 healthy subjects. Allele frequencies were found to be similar in both populations. Thus, there is no susceptibility nor resistance to HIV-infected linked to the CR1 gene. Defective expression of CR1 in HIV-infected patients is acquired through central and/or peripheral mechanisms.\r"

On four separate days volunteers were assigned randomly to receive either placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) or three i.v. doses of nalbuphine (15, 30 and 60 mg 70 kg-1), followed 90 min later by naloxone 0.4 mg 70 kg-1. Duplicate rebreathing tests were performed and the mean intercept at PE'CO2 7 kPa and the slopes of the linear relationship between inspiratory minute ventilation (Vl) or occlusion pressure (P0.1) with PE'CO2 were measured. Nalbuphine significantly decreased the mean intercept of the Vl (P less than 0.01) and P0.1 (P less than 0.05) responses, but caused no changes in the slopes. No significant difference between the doses was noted, suggesting that an Effect maximum (E'max) for respiratory depression was reached with a dose of approximately 15 mg 70 kg-1. Naloxone was less effective in antagonizing the depression in Vl at the higher dose of nalbuphine. Similar P0.1 values were associated with the same inspiratory flow rate (1 litre s-1) before and after drug treatment, suggesting that nalbuphine acts centrally to depress ventilation. Sedation increased significantly following each dose of nalbuphine (P less than 0.001). No demonstrable difference between the doses was shown, suggesting an Effect maximum (E'max) for sedation was reached at about 15 mg 70 kg-1. Administration of nalbuphine was associated with pain at the injection site, dizziness, dreaming, nausea and vomiting. Cardiovascular stability was maintained in all subjects.\r"

Additional 1-mg bolus doses of alfentanil were administered as required. Plasma samples were assayed for alfentanil using radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by a model-independent approach and by curve-fitting. Regression analysis showed no statistical relationship between T 1/2 beta, Cl or Vd and the duration of the infusion, total dose or body weight. We found no significant correlation between age and T 1/2 beta of alfentanil for patients younger than 40 yr. For patients older than 40 yr, T 1/2 beta increased linearly with age. There was no significant decrease in Cl with age, although the lower values for Cl (100-200 ml min-1) were generally found in subjects older than 60 yr. The present study demonstrated that a 100-micrograms kg-1 loading dose and a 1-micrograms kg-1 min-1 infusion may be appropriate for analgesia in general surgical procedures.\r"

The animals were treated with high frequency oscillation (HFO) at 15 Hz and the results compared with those of a previously studied group of eight similar rabbits treated with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with end-expiratory pressure equal to the pressure at the inflection point, but with the same mean airway pressure of 15 mm Hg. The animals treated with HFO had significantly higher arterial oxygen tensions and end-expiratory lung volumes than those treated with CMV, but there was no significant difference between hyaline membrane scores. Although there was no significant difference in mean survival times, five of the HFO treated animals showed reversion of the shape of their pressure-volume curves towards the prelavage configuration, suggesting a recovery of surfactant function.\r"

Following suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 and tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was supplemented during the induction-delivery period in the thiopentone group with 50% nitrous oxide and 0.5% halothane in oxygen in 10 patients, and with 1% halothane in 100% oxygen in the other 10 patients. In the ketamine group, the patients underwent ventilation with 50% nitrous oxide and 0.5% halothane in oxygen in 10 patients, with 1% halothane in 100% in 10 patients, and with 100% oxygen only in the last 10 patients. Awareness was significantly greater after induction with thiopentone (14/20) than after ketamine (4/30). There were no significant differences in Apgar scores or umbilical vein blood-gas values in the newborns.\r"

  ".W": "Highly purified natural killer (NK) cell suspensions were tested for their capacity to release colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in vitro. NK cell suspensions comprised primarily CD16+ cells and were devoid of CD3+ T cells, CD15+ monocytes, and of B cells. CSA was detected in the NK cell supernatants and sustained the growth of myeloid colonies from both normal peripheral blood and bone marrow. CSA could be in part inhibited by pretreating NK cell culture supernatants with a specific goat anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antiserum. The inhibition, however, was never complete, a finding that suggests that additional factors were responsible for CSA. Incubation of NK cells with K562 cells (an NK-sensitive target) or with normal bone marrow cells resulted in the appearance of a strong colony-inhibiting activity (CIA) in the culture supernatants. Such CIA was demonstrable in an experimental system where bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitors were induced to form myeloid colonies in the presence of conditioned medium by CSA-producing giant cell tumor (GCT) cells. Stimulation of NK cells with NK-insensitive targets failed to induce CIA production. Neutralizing antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were found capable of inhibiting CIA present in the supernatants of NK cells stimulated with K562 cells. Following treatment with anti-TNF antibodies, CSA was again detectable in the same supernatants. This finding indicates that induction of TNF production did not concomitantly switch off CSA production by NK cells. Pretreatment of NK cells with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) or gamma interferon (r gamma IFN) did not change the amount of CSA released. However, treatment with rIL-2 caused the appearance of a factor in the NK cell supernatants capable of sustaining the formation of colonies of a larger size.\r"

The propositus, the only family member studied while taking oral anticoagulants, had a protein S antigen (ag) level of 17% and undetectable activity. As demonstrated by immunoblotting both the propositus and one clinically affected brother (42% ag, 7% activity) presented variant protein S molecules of 65,000 molecular weight (mol wt) while the other clinically affected brother (64% ag, 11% activity) had only protein S with normal electrophoretic mobility of 70,000 mol wt. The mother had normal protein S levels (93% ag, 100% activity) but had both normal and variant protein S molecules and based on her functional protein S data a normal anticoagulant activity of the variant molecule is suggested. One asymptomatic but protein S deficient sister (68% ag, 9% activity) as well as the asymptomatic protein S deficient father (59% ag, 10% activity) had only protein S molecules of 70,000 mol wt. The variant protein S bound to C4b-binding protein in plasma, and differed from normal protein S in carbohydrate content. Platelets of each family member contained the same immunoblotting pattern of normal and variant protein S forms as found in plasma, consistent with the hypothesis that protein S gene expression involves codominant expression of two alleles that is similar in cells that control the synthesis of both platelet and plasma forms of protein S.\r"

In order to study the mechanisms of thrombin stimulation, we measured changes in levels of mRNA for t-PA and PAI-1 following exposure of endothelial cells to 3 U/mL alpha thrombin. Alpha thrombin causes a significant and time-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of both t-PA and PAI-1. Catalytically inactivated diisofluorophosphate (DIP) treated thrombin and alpha thrombin pretreated with hirudin do not alter t-PA and PAI-1 mRNA levels. We conclude that the increased secretion of t-PA and PAI-1 by human umbilical vein endothelial cells in response to alpha thrombin is mediated at least partially through an increase in mRNA levels. In addition, an active thrombin catalytic site is required for these increases in mRNA to occur.\r"

The heavy chain is of the VHIII subgroup, and the light chain is of the VKI subgroup. The heavy chain is the expression product of the VH26 germline gene. The light chain bears significant homology to other immunoglobulins of known primary structure, including WEA, GAL, HAU, HK101, and DEE. These results suggest that HF2-1/17 may be an autoantibody derived with little or no modification from germline genes. A model of the antibody combining site suggests that arginine 24 and arginine 30 in the light chain (CDR1) interact with a surface defined by phosphate or sulfate groups of the antigen.\r"

This population was purified for further analysis by depletion with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Southern blot analysis showed preferential rearrangements of the V gamma 9 genes. Northern blot demonstrated the presence of V gamma 9 mRNA transcripts. With MoAbs directed against either the V gamma 9 peptide (Ti gamma A) or the delta chain of the gamma delta T-cell receptor (TCR delta 1), we further demonstrated that those cell surfaces expressed both V gamma 9 and a delta gene product. In addition, analysis of the gamma gene rearrangements on six clones derived from this population demonstrated a unique rearrangement on a single chromosome, strongly suggesting the monoclonality of this T-cell population. Significant cytotoxic activity against K562, U937 was observed only after an in vitro culture period with interleukin-2 (IL-2), whereas no specific inhibitory effect on autologous bone marrow (BM) CFU-G was noted.\r"

Twenty one patients were HIV-negative (Group 1), 27 were HIV-positive without having AIDS-related complex (ARC)/AIDS (Group 2), and 13 had ARC/AIDS (Group 3). T, CD4-positive, or CD8-positive T lymphocytes were cocultured with B lymphocytes and pokeweed mitogen for 6 days and immunoglobulin producing cells were assessed in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. In HIV-infected patients, T cells as well as the CD4-positive T cell subset exhibited reduced helper (P less than .01, Group 2; P less than .0005, Group 3) and elevated suppressor activity (P less than .02, Group 2; P less than .005, Group 3), whereas no significant difference was found between HIV-negative patients and controls. The number of CD4-positive cells was not correlated with CD4 cell function. CD4-positive cells showed no helper activity (less than 10% of control T cells) in 8/11 (73%), but an excessive suppressor activity (greater than 80% suppression of plaque formation) in 6/11 (55%) Group 3 patients. Our results show that defective helper and elevated suppressor functions of T cells in HIV-infected patients are caused not only by a change in the CD4/CD8 cell counts but also by functional abnormalities of the CD4-positive T-cell subset. These abnormal helper and suppressor functions may play a role in the development of the immunodeficiency state of AIDS patients.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed T-cell receptor delta (TcR-delta) gene rearrangement and transcription in appropriately phenotyped mononuclear cells derived from 12 patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The T-ALL cells were also analyzed for rearrangement and transcription of the T-cell receptor(TcR)-beta and gamma genes as well as for the presence of TcR-alpha gene transcripts. Four T-ALLs expressed TcR-gamma delta at the cell surface, while three expressed TcR-alpha beta. The other five T-ALLs did not express a TcR-CD3 complex on their cell membrane. The TcR-gamma delta + T-ALL had rearranged both TcR-delta gene alleles and contained mature 2.2 and 1.5 kb TcR-delta transcripts. In one case, immature 1.9 and 1.2 kb TcR-delta transcripts were also found. Furthermore they contained mature TcR-gamma mRNA, mature or immature TcR-beta mRNA, but no TcR-alpha mRNA. The three TcR-alpha beta + T-ALLs contained mature alpha and beta transcripts, but lacked TcR-delta transcripts as a result of deletion of both TcR-delta gene alleles. These data are in line with a mutually exclusive expression of TcR-alpha and -delta genes, which may be important to ensure the presence of only one type of TcR per T cell. One of the five CD3- T-ALLs had germline TcR-beta, gamma, and delta genes. The other four CD3- T-ALLs had rearranged their TcR-beta, gamma, and delta genes and contained immature 1.9 and 1.2 kb TcR-delta gene transcripts. Remarkably, one of these T-ALLs also contained TcR-alpha transcripts in addition to the immature TcR-delta transcripts, which was in line with the deletion of one TcR-delta gene allele and rearrangement of the other allele. This suggests that prevention of dual receptor expression may not only be regulated by the presence of germline TcR-alpha genes in TcR-gamma delta + cells or by deletion of both TcR-delta gene alleles in TcR-alpha beta + cells, but also via other regulation mechanisms. Finally, our data indicated that the combinatorial repertoire of the TcR-delta genes is limited, which has also been described for the TcR-gamma genes.\r"

  ".W": "Culturing of leukemic blood lymphocytes from a patient with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with interleukin-2 (IL-2) yielded T-cell line AK-1 with a remarkable cytotoxic specificity. This line mediated strong lysis of tumor target lines expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, such as Raji, CEM, and Molt-4 cells, but no killing of K562 and Daudi cells, which are deficient in MHC class I. In contrast, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors destroyed all these tumor targets, without MHC restriction. Line AK-1, originating from residual normal T cells present in the leukemic blood, lysed autologous leukemic blasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from many but not all allogeneic individuals but failed to kill autologous remission lymphocytes. Destruction of the autologous leukemic targets by AK-1 could be inhibited by unlabeled competitor target cells that were lysed by AK-1, but not by target cells that were not lysed. This suggests that AK-1 specifically recognized an alien determinant on the autologous ALL cells, crossreactive with allogeneic MHC class I antigens. This reactivity with some degree of tumor specificity may be a leukemic equivalent to responses reported for populations of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) seen in some solid tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Gene configurations of immunoglobulin (Ig), T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) beta chain, and T-cell rearranging gene gamma (TRG gamma) were studied in human B-precursor lymphoblastic leukemic cells. These cells were phenotypically classified into three developmental stages (stages II through IV) according to Nadler's criteria. All of them showed the Ig heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement, and 67% of the cells in stage IV had the rearranged TRG gamma, albeit seldom in other stages. We further analyzed IgH gene rearrangements in detail using upstream to DH (diversity region of IgH) region probe to distinguish DJ from V-DJ recombination. All dual genotyped cells in each stage except one case in stage II showed the V-DJ rearrangements. This suggests the cross-lineage involvement of the putative recombinase, particularly in the process of V-DJ rearrangements. We next examined the transcriptional status of Ig genes as an indirect reflection of the accessibility of these genes to the recombinase. Properly spliced IgH transcripts of normal size were observed in stage IV and surface Ig positive stage, but not in stage II nor III. However, IgH transcripts of aberrant sizes were seen in stage II, III, and also IV. Cross-lineage gene rearrangements were shown to occur frequently when normally spliced IgH gene begins to be transcribed or just before this. These findings may implicate that V-DJ or V-VDJ gene rearrangements forming functional IgH genes, induce frequently TCR or TRG gene rearrangements. We propose these dual genotypes are different in origin from those observed in stem cell leukemia.\r"

The leukemic origin of cell line PER-255 is indicated by its cytochemical and immunologic similarity to the patient's fresh leukemic cells, which correspond to immature cortical thymocytes. Southern blot analysis showed that the IgJH genes were in germline configuration, whereas both alleles of the T-cell receptor-beta (TCR-beta) gene were rearranged in PER-255 cells, with identical rearrangements present in the patient's leukemic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed a single abnormal clone with the karyotype 46,XY,t(7;10)(q32-34;q24),t(9;12) (p22;p12-13). Reciprocal translocations involving chromosome bands 7q32-36, containing the gene for the TCR-beta chain, have been reported for a number of tumors of T-cell origin. Translocations involving the 7q32-36 region appear to be nonrandomly associated with childhood T-ALL, whereas abnormalities of 9p and 12p have been reported to be nonrandomly involved in ALL but not specifically associated with the T-cell phenotype.\r"

Since this translocation is a recurrent marker of T-ALL, we undertook to investigate its mode of formation and role in leukemogenesis. The cytogenetic breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurs in 14q11, the same band wherein lies the T-cell receptor alpha/delta chain gene; and Southern hybridization analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow DNA uncovered a tumor-specific rearrangement in the D delta-J delta region of this locus. DNA encompassing the rearrangement was isolated by molecular cloning, and further analysis revealed it to be the t(11;14)(p13;q11) junction. Nucleotide sequence determination of the junction indicates that the 14q11 breakpoint occurs immediately adjacent to the D delta 2 gene segment. Hence, the translocation arose as an aberrant rearrangement between the downstream recombination signal of D delta 2 and a pseudo recombination signal adjacent to the chromosome 11 breakpoint. Finally, comparison of the breakpoint in band 11p13 with those of other translocations (11;14)(p13;q11) identified a breakpoint cluster region of approximately 1.2 kilobase-pairs (kb), alterations of which may promote the development of T-ALL.\r"

The results of in situ hybridization performed under blind conditions by IgH gene and TCR beta chain gene probes were compatible with those of typing by cell surface markers. The nuclear protein-related proto-oncogenes, fos, myc, and myb, were expressed in about 70% to 80% of all cases regardless of phenotype, histology, or histologic grade.

  ".W": "Acute and chronic lymphatic leukemias were investigated on the single-cell level for the activity of genes coding for the IgM heavy chain and the alpha and beta chains of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). We used a new method for preparing highly fluorochrome-labeled gene probes for in situ hybridization, which allowed rapid and quantitative detection of mRNA at the individual cell level. Leukemic cell populations classified as belonging to the B lineage according to their surface antigenic patterns revealed increasing expression of mRNA for the IgM heavy chain (mu mRNA) in a maturation-dependent fashion, which was not correlated to rearrangement of the immunoglobulin mu chain gene--only 66% of the leukemias with rearranged mu gene also transcribed it. TCR mRNA was detected in B-antigen positive leukemic cells. High levels of both TCR and mu mRNA expression in all cells of some of these leukemias allowed the conclusion that these cells simultaneously transcribed the genes for T and B cell antigen receptors. TCR mRNA was also found in what are considered relatively mature B leukemias, lineage cross-over on the mRNA level being observed at a frequency of 23% (five of 22 cases), comparable with that of \"inappropriate\" receptor gene rearrangement. The quantitation of mRNA with fluorochrome-labeled gene probes in situ may allow determining the degree of gene activation in individual antigenically defined cells and may thus contribute a new tool for characterization of normal and malignant cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cells in the vasculature, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells, have been shown to be jointly involved in the biosynthesis of active lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid. Stimulation of neutrophils with the calcium ionophore A23187 as a model for cell activation results in production of leukotriene (LT)A4 with subsequent intracellular conversion into LTB4. When platelets or endothelial cells were present in the incubation system, LTC4 was produced from the neutrophil-derived LTA4. Whereas production and release of LTA4 under resting conditions in vivo might be expected to be quite low, under pathologic conditions, LTA4 production could be markedly increased. Therefore, the metabolism of exogenous LTA4 by platelets and endothelial cells was studied at a wide range of LTA4 concentrations. The production of LTC4 during coincubation of neutrophils with platelets was found to be dependent on neutrophil number ranging from 2 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(7) cells/mL. When a fixed number of neutrophils were stimulated with platelets alone or with mixtures of platelets and endothelial cells, LTC4 production was observed to be dependent on both acceptor cell types. These results suggest that mixed cell populations, which are likely to occur in vivo, may be critical determinants of the profile of eicosanoids produced in pathophysiologic circumstances. We suggest that both endothelial cells and platelets, in the presence of neutrophils, contribute large quantities of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes to inflammatory and thrombotic situations. Furthermore, platelets, because of their quantity and reactivity, may play a pivotal role in transcellular biosynthesis of eicosanoids.\r"

Binding was inhibited by lysine and reversed by lysine, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, or nonradiolabeled plasminogen. The Kd for binding of 125I-plasminogen to hepatocytes was 0.59 +/- 0.16 mumol/L, as determined from the saturation isotherm by nonlinear regression (r2 = 0.99) and the Scatchard transformation by linear regression (r2 = 0.93). The number of sites per cell was 14.1 +/- 1.1 x 10(6). Fibrinogen synthesis and secretion by hepatocytes was insufficient to account for the major fraction of plasminogen binding, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and trichloroacetic acid precipitation studies demonstrated that plasminogen is neither activated nor degraded when bound to hepatocytes at 37 degrees C. Thin slices of whole rat liver (500 microns), isolated and prepared totally at 4 degrees C, bound 125I-plasminogen. Binding was inhibited by lysine. 125I-albumin binding to liver slices was minimal and not inhibited by lysine. Activation of plasminogen by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was enhanced by hepatocytes in primary culture. When lysine was included in the media, the enhanced rate of activation was no longer observed. After activation with t-PA, much of the plasmin remained associated with hepatocyte surfaces and was partially protected from inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin. These studies suggest that hepatocyte plasminogen binding sites may provide important surface anticoagulant activity.\r"

  ".W": "Iron transport in the reticuloendothelial (RE) system plays a central role in iron metabolism, but its regulation has not been characterized physiologically in vivo in humans. In particular, why serum iron is elevated and RE cells are much less iron-loaded than parenchymal cells in idiopathic hemochromatosis is not known. The processing of erythrocyte iron by the RE system was studied after intravenous (IV) injection of 59Fe heat-damaged RBCs (HDRBCs) and 55Fe transferrin in normal subjects and in patients with iron deficiency, idiopathic hemochromatosis, inflammation, marrow aplasia, or hyperplastic erythropoiesis. Early release of 59Fe by the RE system was calculated from the plasma iron turnover and the 59Fe plasma reappearance curve. Late release was calculated from the ratio of 59Fe/55Fe RBC utilization in 2 weeks. The partitioning of iron between the early (release from heme catabolism) and late (release from RE stores) phases depended on the size of RE iron stores, as illustrated by the inverse relationship observed between early release and plasma ferritin (P less than .001). There was a strong correlation between early release and the rate of change of serum iron levels during the first three hours in normal subjects (r = .85, P less than .001). Inflammation produced a blockade of the early release phase, whereas in idiopathic hemochromatosis early release was considerably increased as compared with subjects with similar iron stores. Based on these results, we describe a model of RE iron metabolism in humans. We conclude that the RE system appears to determine the diurnal fluctuations in serum iron levels through variations in the immediate output of heme iron. In idiopathic hemochromatosis, a defect of the RE cell in withholding iron freed from hemoglobin could be responsible for the high serum iron levels and low RE iron stores.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular endothelial cells (EC) play an active role in the synthesis and assembly of components of the fibrinolytic system and the generation of the major fibrinolytic protease plasmin. However, the reciprocal effects of plasmin on EC function have not been previously examined. We have studied the actions of plasmin on the production of prostacyclin (PGI2) by cultured human umbilical vein (HUVEC) and bovine aortic (BAEC) endothelial cells. Plasmin causes little or no direct stimulation of PGI2 formation by EC. Preincubation of EC with plasmin, however, produces a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of ionophore A23187-, thrombin-, and histamine-induced PGI2 synthesis; a smaller inhibitory effect on arachidonate- and PGH2-induced PGI2 synthesis is found. Incubation of HUVEC or BAEC with a physiologic concentration of plasminogen (180 micrograms/mL) and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) generates tPA dose-dependent plasmin activity that exceeds that generated in the absence of EC. In the presence of plasminogen, tPA also causes a tPA dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin- and ionophore A23187-stimulated PGI2 production. PGI2 inhibitory plasmin activity is generated within the concentration range of tPA achieved in plasma during pharmacologic therapy with tPA. These findings suggest that vascular endothelial cells not only regulate activation of the fibrinolytic system but may also be targets of plasmin action on PGI2 synthesis in the modulation of hemostasis and thrombosis.\r"

Our results showed that when plasma was triggered with a relatively high concentration of thromboplastin, factor VIII and factor V were completely activated at the clotting time of plasma. However, when the generation of thrombin, but not that of factor Xa, was delayed by addition of hirudin to the plasma, factor Va was generated only at the time thrombin generation overcame the hirudin inhibition. In addition, generation of factor VIIIa correlated with thrombin generation and not with factor Xa generation. Furthermore, addition of large amounts of factor Xa to hirudinized plasma did not show detectable factor VIII or factor V activation. We concluded that in plasma activated with thromboplastin the enzyme responsible for activation of factor V and factor VIII is thrombin, not factor Xa.\r"

During fibrinolysis, thrombin is released as thrombin-FDP complex and is inactivated by heparin-AT III. However, as successive fibrin layers are removed, inaccessible molecules of thrombin are exposed at the surface of the residual clot, possibly contributing to the occurrence during thrombolytic therapy of coagulation that is poorly controlled by heparin. We have investigated the accessibility of fibrin-bound thrombin to hirudin. The results clearly show that two recombinant hirudin variants neutralize thrombin both in solution and fibrin bound. Furthermore, we have found that in in vitro models, hirudin present in the surrounding medium of a clot under lysis is more efficient than heparin in preventing the activation of coagulation. This observation suggests that hirudin may be effective in the prevention of the rethrombotic process frequently encountered during thrombolytic therapy.\r"

A subgroup of the patients develops inhibitors against factor VIII during substitution therapy. Because a considerable percentage of all cases is thought to result from de novo mutations, it is likely that many different molecular lesions lead to hemophilia A. In order to understand the molecular basis of this disorder, we examined 160 patients with different clinical features using factor VIII gene probes. We could identify six different deletions and seven nonsense mutations within the factor VIII gene. Family analysis revealed that five of these mutations occurred de novo within two generations; two of them arose in the maternal grandfather and three in the mother. In one of these mothers we could identify a mitotic origin. Mapping of the deletions showed no deletion-prone region within the gene. Furthermore, we could not find any correlation between the particular gene defects and \"inhibitor\" phenotypes.\r"

Two proteins have been identified on human peripheral blood monocytes that can function as Fc gamma receptors, Fc gamma RI (70 Kd) and Fc gamma RII (40 Kd). We studied the role of Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII on human monocytes by examining their binding of IgG-sensitized cells (human IgG anti-D-coated RBCs and rabbit IgG-sensitized sheep RBCs) and their binding of human trimeric IgG. To examine the function of monocyte Fc gamma RII, we used an anti-Fc gamma RII monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that competes for the Fc gamma RII ligand binding site. Preincubation of monocytes with saturating concentrations of anti-Fc gamma RII MoAb did not alter the recognition of IgG (anti-D)-sensitized human RBCs by monocytes. Furthermore, ligand-binding studies demonstrated that anti-Fc gamma RII antibody altered neither the number nor the affinity of monocyte-binding sites for human IgG trimer. Anti-Fc gamma RII inhibited monocyte binding of rabbit IgG-sensitized sheep RBCs, but only at low ionic strength or temperature when increased numbers of monocyte Fc gamma RII were expressed. At low ionic strength and 4 degrees C, anti-Fc gamma RII also partially inhibited monocyte binding of human trimeric IgG. Thus, monocyte Fc gamma RII does not appear to recognize IgG-sensitized RBCs or trimeric IgG at physiologic temperatures and ionic strength. The data suggest that Fc gamma RI is the primary Fc gamma receptor on monocytes involved in the binding of IgG (anti-D)-sensitized erythrocytes and low mol wt complexes of IgG.\r"

In all 11 T-cell malignancies, rearrangement and/or deletion of TCR delta was detected irrespective of the stage of maturation of the tumor. The organization of TCR delta correlated with the phenotype of the tumor: In \"prethymic\" T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), TCR delta was the only TCR gene to be rearranged. More mature T cell malignancies expressing CD4 together with CD3 showed deletion of both alleles of TCR delta, suggestive of TCR V alpha-J alpha rearrangement. All 43 B-cell tumors expressing surface immunoglobulin (sIg), including two cases of adult B-cell ALL, had germline configuration of TCR delta/alpha. In contrast, all 17 B-cell precursor ALLs (null, common, and pre-B-cell ALLs) had rearrangement and/or deletion of TCR delta/alpha. A single case of \"histiocytic\" lymphoma also showed biallelic deletion of TCR delta. Oligoclonal rearrangements of Ig and TCR genes were observed in two cases of B-cell precursor ALL and in one case of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Patterns of such \"aberrant\" TCR rearrangement were similar to those observed in T-lineage malignancies. In particular, seven of eight cases of B-cell precursor ALL and the histiocytic lymphoma which demonstrated biallelic TCR delta deletion, (suggestive of a V alpha-J alpha rearrangement) had clonal TCR beta rearrangement. These data support the hypothesis that supposedly aberrant rearrangements of the TCR genes may follow the same developmental controls as found in T-cell differentiation, despite the lack of evidence for further commitment to the T-cell lineage. TCR delta rearrangement is a useful marker of clonality of immature T-cell tumors which may have only this gene rearranged but is not specific to the T-cell lineage.\r"

This model of GVHD was used to define and characterize a graft-v-tumor (GVT) effect against a syngeneic plasmacytoma CRL1662 cell line which expresses class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigen (Ia). Nylon wool-nonadherent spleen cells from animals who developed syngeneic GVHD were capable of significant lysis against chromium-labeled tumor target cells in a four-hour chromium released cell mediated lympholysis assay; maximum lysis occurred five days following cessation of CsA when clinical signs first appeared. Cytolytic activity declined to baseline as GVHD symptoms resolved. Fractionation of splenocytes into lymphocyte subsets demonstrated that cytolytic lymphocytes (CTLs) of the OX8 phenotype (non-helper T) were capable of significant lysis against tumor target cells. Lysis of tumor cells was blocked by preincubation with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) specific for the rat anti-class II MHC antigen but not with MoAb against class I. Incubation of tumor cells with gamma-interferon increased expression of tumor class II MHC antigens and significantly increased their susceptibility to lysis by nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes from animals with syngeneic GVHD. These studies have demonstrated an in vitro GVT of syngeneic GVHD against an Ia-bearing tumor; the effector cell is a CTL of the OX8 phenotype specific for the class II MHC antigen.\r"

Previous investigations of t-PA-fibrin interaction, using incorporation of t-PA into polymerizing fibrin clots, have suggested that no significant differences exist in the binding of one-chain or two-chain t-PA to non-cross-linked or cross-linked fibrin. In the present study, binding of 125I-labeled and affinity-purified one-chain and two-chain forms of t-PA to preformed non-cross-linked or cross-linked, sonicated suspension of fibrin was investigated. Interaction of one-chain t-PA with cross-linked fibrin involved a single type of binding site with dissociation constant (kd) of 0.58 mumol/L and a stoichiometry (n) of 1.5. Interaction of one-chain t-PA with non-cross-linked fibrin, however, involved two classes of binding sites with dissociation constants of 0.32 and 1.5 mumol/L and corresponding number of binding sites equal to 0.57 and 2.0, respectively. In contrast to the binding of one-chain t-PA to cross-linked fibrin by a limited number of sites, two-chain t-PA appeared to involve a considerably greater number of sites (minimum six) whose dissociation constant was 3.2 mumol/L. Interaction of two-chain t-PA with non-cross-linked fibrin also showed the presence of many binding sites (minimum seven) with approximate dissociation constant of 6.4 mumol/L, as well as a few (n = 0.012) high-affinity sites with a kd of 0.011 mumol/L epsilon-Aminocaproic acid did not completely reverse the binding of either one-chain t-PA or two-chain t-PA to fibrin. The present findings suggest that the fibrin-binding properties of t-PA undergo considerable changes on proteolytic conversion from one-chain to two-chain t-PA, catalyzed under physiologic conditions by plasmin. The cleavage of one-chain t-PA to two-chain t-PA allows to bind to a large number of low-affinity binding sites on fibrin. Cross-linking of fibrin by factor XIIIa results in masking of high-affinity binding sites that are present in non-cross-linked fibrin. We propose that both plasmin and factor XIIIa play an important regulatory role in dissolution of blood clots by modulating t-PA-fibrin interaction.\r"

Twelve patients requested total resection of the endometrial lining with the intention of producing amenorrhoea, and four chose partial resection and hypomenorrhoea. Surgery was completed successfully in 15; the remaining woman, who had an acutely retroflexed uterus, sustained a uterine perforation during insertion of the rigid hysteroscope. There were no important postoperative complications, and 13 patients were discharged from hospital the day after operation. Follow up for up to six months showed beneficial effects on the duration of menses and the subjective assessment of menstrual blood loss and pain in the treated women, six of them becoming amenorrhoeic after total resection. Hysteroscopy at three months in 13 patients showed fibrosis confined to the upper half of the uterine cavity. Endouterine biopsy specimens showed the presence of microscopic deposits of normal endometrium in 10 women. Although these results are preliminary, transcervical resection of the endometrium may have an important role in managing this common complaint.\r"

Men who were unemployed but seeking work consulted with doctors significantly more (odds ratio 1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 2.09) than those in employment, the highest consultation rate being among those who had been out of work for five years or more (odds ratio 2.12; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 3.78). The high consultation rates persisted even after adjustment for self reported longstanding illness (odds ratio 1.53; 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.76). These findings suggest that in areas with high unemployment general practitioner workload is likely to be high.\r"

Genomic Southern blots with various restriction enzymes showed no large abnormalities in his calcitonin gene. Genomic clones representing his calcitonin gene were then analysed. His gene encoded normal precursor polypeptides for calcitonin and calcitonin gene related peptide; the only abnormality identified was a single base insertion in the intron separating exons IV and V of the gene. The affected sequence is homologous with an intron sequence from beta globin that is implicated in splicing and forming a crucial intermediate structure during the maturation of messenger RNA. The change observed may be responsible for the patient's calcitonin deficiency and consequently for his condition, suggesting that calcitonin is important in preventing bone loss.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the prevalence and severity of acne among schoolchildren in Glasgow. DESIGN--Secondary schools in Glasgow were divided by postcode into five socioeconomic cluster groups. Different numbers of schools were selected at random from the five groups to ensure proportional representation. One class from each registration year of the chosen schools was selected at random and the whole class recruited into the study. SETTING--15 Secondary schools in Glasgow. SUBJECTS--2014 Randomly selected schoolchildren aged 12-17 (5% of total secondary school roll). INTERVENTIONS--None. END POINT--Assessment of facial acne by two independent examiners by a recognised acne scoring system. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--The prevalence of acne in boys increased from 40% (75/189) at age 12 to 95% (108/114) at age 16, and in girls it increased from 61% (114/187) at age 12 to 83% (136/164) at age 16. On a scale of 0 to 10 only 18 boys (1.8%) and three girls (0.3%) had grades of acne of 1.0 or greater; most of the pupils had grade 0.05-0.375 (minimal) acne. Nine per cent of boys (88/973) and 14% of girls (145/1041) had visited their general practitioner specifically for advice on and treatment for acne; only five pupils (0.3%) had been referred to a dermatologist. CONCLUSIONS--Both the prevalence and severity of acne have decreased over the past 20 years. This has probably been due to improvement of treatment for acne by primary care doctors and the greater availability and use of over the counter preparations for acne.\r"

DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING--A county in south west England. SUBJECTS--All general practitioner principals (n = 537) under contract with Avon Family Practitioner Committee. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--492 doctors (92%) responded to the survey. More than three quarters of the respondents were opposed to the government's proposals on budgets for specific surgical procedures, prescribing, and diagnostic tests; and between 63% and 93% felt negative about advantages that might accrue from the proposals. Over three quarters of general practitioners were in favour of family practitioner committees monitoring work load, prescribing, and referrals. General practitioners in large, potentially budget holding practices held similar views to doctors in smaller practices. CONCLUSIONS--Avon's general practitioners substantially reject most of the government's proposals about general practice in the white paper Working for Patients.\r"

  ".W": "The recognition and investigation of an outbreak of food poisoning in 1982 due to chocolate contaminated with Salmonella napoli enabled the food that carried the salmonella to be identified and four fifths of the implicated consignment of chocolate to be withdrawn. The economic benefits of prompt intervention in the outbreak have been assessed. The cost of the outbreak was over 0.5 pounds m. It is estimated that five deaths were prevented by the intervention and that 185 admissions to hospital and 29,000 cases of S napoli enteritis were avoided. This successful investigation yielded a 3.5-fold rate of return to the public sector and a 23.3-fold return to society on an investment in public health surveillance. A methodology is described that can be used to estimate the benefits of early intervention in outbreaks of foodborne illness and topics for further research are suggested. It is concluded that public health authorities and industry have much to gain by collaborating in the research into the design of cost effective programmes to prevent foodborne infections.\r"
