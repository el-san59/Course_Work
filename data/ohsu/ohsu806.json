  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of custom-contoured cushions (CCCs) in providing a safe sitting surface. The efficacy of CCCs was investigated using ten spinal cord injured persons who evaluated contoured foam as their primary wheelchair cushion. External pressures at the seat interface were measured on a subject's regular cushion and on a CCC to compare the respective load distributions. Pressure distributions measured on a CCC were statistically lower than those measured on the subject's usual cushion (p less than .05). Eight clinical variables were used to judge each cushion's effect on the functional abilities of wheelchair users. Sitting on a CCC seemed to improve posture and balance when compared to the subject's regular cushion. Based on these results, it is suggested that contouring technology be developed as a clinical tool for managing wheelchair users' seating problems.\r"

This study reports the results of a randomized controlled trial of computer-based rehabilitation with blind follow-up for six months. Thirty-six patients with unilateral neglect, as defined by the behavioral subtests of the Behavioural Inattention Test, were randomized into two groups. One group of 20 subjects received a mean of 15.5 (SD = 1.8) hours of computerized scanning and attentional training; the second group of 16 subjects received a mean of 11.4 (SD = 5.2) hours of recreational computing (selected to minimize scanning and timed attentional tasks). Blind follow-up at the end of training and six months after revealed no statistically or clinically significant results between groups. These findings argue against routine clinical use of this type of computerized training until further studies establish what type, frequency, and duration of training produces clinically significant changes in unilateral visual neglect if, indeed, computerized training can have an effect with this type of disorder.\r"

Nineteen mildly MR adults performed strength tests on a Cybex 340 isokinetic dynamometer on two separate days; 12 subjects performed a third trial of knee flexion and extension tests. For the 19 subjects, there were no significant differences in strength measurements--except for peak torque of knee flexion--between the first two test days. There were relatively high correlation coefficients when test parameters were compared for both test days, and best efforts occurred almost as often on test day two as on test day one. For the 12 subjects tested on three test days, there were no significant differences for test parameters among the three test days; however, 25% of best efforts took place on test day three. These findings indicate that when measuring the isokinetic strength of mildly MR individuals, tests should be performed at least two, optimally three, separate times to ensure reliability. The test protocol would be reliable when measuring knee and elbow flexion and extension strength for job assessment or clinical or rehabilitation purposes.\r"

The role played by hemineglect in the appearance of shoulder pain was studied. During two years, 94 hemiplegic subjects were involved in a rehabilitation program after cerebrovascular accidents. Their average age was 68 years; 45 (47.9%) subjects had shoulder pain, and 24 subjects (22.5%) had hemineglect. The subjects with shoulder pain were compared to those without pain (the control group) with respect to gender, age, diabetes, heart failure, cardiac ischemia, scapulohumeral arthritis, and calcified tendinitis of the rotator cuff. We were unable to demonstrate a relationship between hemineglect and shoulder pain in the hemiplegic (X2 (1) = 2.03, p = .15), although pain was significantly more frequent in subjects with right hemispheric cerebrovascular accident (X2 (1) = 5.0, p less than .025). The subjects with shoulder pain had significantly more spasticity of the affected limb (X2 (1) = 26.3, p less than .01), less sensitivity to pinprick of the upper paralyzed extremity (X2 (1) = 10.8, p less than .01), and a more severe subluxation of the affected shoulder (t(51) = 14.0, p less than .01).\r"

Four 30-minute treatments were administered at 1.5-hour intervals. One limb of each subject was randomly selected to receive cathodal 120-Hz HVPC at voltages 10% lower than those needed to evoke muscle contraction. Limb volumes were measured by water displacement. ANOVA with repeated measures, Newman-Keuls post hoc tests, and selected t-tests were used to determine significance of limb volume changes. HVPC retarded edema formation. HVPC was so effective (p less than .0001) that significant differences between treated and untreated limb volumes were evident after the first treatment (p less than .01), and these differences remained throughout a 17-hour posttreatment period.\r"

Retention of xenon in adipose tissue prevented accurate measurement of blood flow in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Average muscle blood flow for both subject groups was increased during stimulation as compared to rest. All subjects showed an increase in muscle blood flow during stimulation. The statistical significance from a paired student t-test was greater for able-bodied subjects (p less than .05) than for spinal cord injured subjects (p = .12). The increase in muscle blood flow produced by electrical muscle stimulation in seated individuals supports the hypothesis that electrical muscle stimulation can help prevent pressure sores.\r"

Plots of Kcal/kg-min and Kcal/kg-m vs walking speed in the RGO and RGO & FES were experimentally determined in this study and compared with the energy cost of walking in the long leg brace (LLB), the hip guidance orthosis (HGO), and an FES walking aid from data available in the literature. The RGO powered with electric stimulation of the thigh muscles required the lowest energy expenditure in Kcal/kg-m across the full range of walking speeds. The RGO, HGO, LLB, and FES walking orthoses ranked second, third, fourth, and fifth respectively. The lowest energy costs in Kcal/kg-min were associated with the RGO & FES, followed by the RGO, HGO, LLB, and FES for walking speeds below .28m/sec. At walking speeds higher than .28m/sec the HGO demonstrates lower energy cost followed by the RGO & FES, RGO, FES, and LLB. At the end of a 30-m walk, patients using the RGO & FES had a mean heart rate (HR) which was 12 beats/min less than the mean HR when using the RGO without FES, 31 beats/min less than the HR when using the LLB, and 42 beats/min less than the HR when using FES only. It was concluded that the FES-powered RGO combines the advantages of a passive mechanical orthosis with those of FES to provide substantial improvements in energy cost which may provide paraplegic persons with a mode of independent ambulation superior to the wheelchair.\r"

GRIP and TAP tests are common measures of motor function selected to distinguish rapid repetitive vs sustained performance. As expected, performance was significantly worse for contralateral-to-lesion arms than for control arms (p less than .001). Ipsilateral-to-lesion performance confirmed predictions of lateralized motor disabilities: R-GRIP in R-CVA survivors was inferior to R-GRIP in controls (p less than .05); L-TAP in L-CVA survivors was inferior to L-TAP in controls (p less than .01). In addition, male CVA survivors had the enhanced abilities predicted in the converse tests: R-TAP in R-CVA men was superior to R-TAP in controls (p less than .10); L-GRIP in L-CVA men was superior to L-GRIP in controls (p less than .01). It was concluded that individuals move differently depending on hemisphere of stroke, and some implications for the poststroke motor rehabilitation program were discussed.\r"

Forty-six conferences with 45 patients were evaluated, and 213 questions were recorded. Each question was placed into one of ten categories, based on the topic of the question. The most common topic about which information was sought was medical issues not directly related to the primary rehabilitation diagnosis (17% of all questions). Discharge planning was the second most common topic (16%). Thirty-one percent of all questions were related to medical issues. The information derived from this study will help rehabilitation professionals to be better prepared for family conferences and discharge planning.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic pain patients and brain injured patients frequently exhibit anxiety, depression, perseveration, and fixed ideation about their injuries. Both populations also frequently suffer from decreased attention, impaired concentration, easy fatigability, personality changes, impaired relationships with family and friends, and difficulty maintaining a job. In cases where chronic pain coexists with traumatic brain injury, the brain injury is often obscured. Risk factors which should alert the medical team to possible coexisting brain injury include history of loss of consciousness at original injury, history of trauma to the head, whiplash injury to the neck, multisystem trauma, and admission of memory or attention deficits by the patient. When any of these risk factors are present, we have found that formal examination of cognitive function is required to explore the potential of coexisting brain injury; if pain is a prominent clinical feature, residual cognitive sequelae of mild brain injury is easily masked. Specific testing of attention, new learning ability, constructional ability, and higher cognitive functions are most helpful in this population, and they need to be included in the mental status examination when concomitant brain injury is suspected. In our study, seven patients were found to have undiagnosed brain injury in a series of 67 consecutive patient referrals to our pain rehabilitation program. Treatment failure is high in this subgroup of pain patients unless treatment is directed toward the sequelae of both brain injury and chronic pain.\r"

At entry, all subjects were free of prior seizures and other neurologic, medical, and psychiatric disorders with the potential to impair cognition. Although no control subject developed seizures during the study period, 7 subjects with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type had at least one documented seizure. All 7 subjects had progressed to the severe stage of dementia by the time of the first seizure. Seizures were generalized tonic-clonic in type and were unassociated with clinical or (in 3 subjects) neuropathologic evidence for epileptogenic factors other than Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that advanced Alzheimer's disease alone may be an important risk factor for new-onset seizures in older adults.\r"

These potential prognostic features were of three types: degree of severity features (eg, IQ scores); variable clinical features (eg, extrapyramidal signs); and individual distinguishing features (eg, gender, education, and age). The power of these potential prognostic features to predict prognosis was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier life-tables method and the Cox proportional hazards model. Three clinical end points were considered: total dependence in activities of daily living; incontinence; and institutionalization at follow-up. Degree of severity features (subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Clinical Severity Score) predicted subsequent dependence in activities of daily living, incontinence, and institutionalization. Historical disease duration, age, gender, family history of dementia, retrospective rate of progression, anxiety, psychosis, depression, and extrapyramidal signs did not influence prognosis. These results suggest that initial degree of severity (\"how far\") rather than variation in the rate of progression (\"how fast\") best predicts prognosis in the early to intermediate stages of Alzheimer's disease. The relationship of disease severity to prognosis should be taken into account before concluding that there are subtypes of Alzheimer's disease that have different rates of progression.\r"

The fibroblasts were exposed for 10 to 14 days to a medium (DMd) modeled on media that favor neuronal differentiation in fetal brain cultures. The addition of a 10-microns concentration of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone to the DMd culture medium increased by more than 10-fold the proportion of cells reacting immunocytochemically with antibodies to paired helical filaments and by 157-fold the proportion of cells reacting with the Alz-50 monoclonal antibody.

The Guamanian subjects had all been exposed to similar Chamorro lifestyles. The scans were analyzed using a graphic method that calculates a constant for whole striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake. The parkinsonian subjects all had significantly reduced striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake. The group with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had significantly reduced uptake that was intermediate between that of the control group and the parkinsonian group. Two Guamanian normal subjects had reduced striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic lesion in Guamanian parkinsonism is similar to that found in idiopathic parkinsonism. The nigrostriatal lesions in the subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the Guamanian normal subjects are examples of subclinical neuronal damage demonstrable in living subjects with positron emission tomography.\r"

An analysis of their place of residence was made using the postal code. This was used to allocate each patient to an electoral ward. Using such small areal units, it was found that more cases of ALS had arisen than would have been expected by chance in several wards during the study period. Although the actual number of wards showing this effect was probably not increased, the significance levels suggest that the disease may not show a random geographical distribution. No evidence of clustering of year of birth was found. These findings indicate the need for further work seeking geographical clusters of ALS and are discussed in relation to current etiological hypotheses of the disease.\r"

The most common motor conduction abnormalities were proximal conduction block alone (27%), proximal block associated with a distal lesion (27%), and generalized slowing (22%). Other combinations of abnormalities each occurred in fewer than 10% of patients. Thirty-seven percent of patients initially had normal sensory nerve conduction study results, most often in association with proximal conduction block. The characteristic early electrodiagnostic changes in Guillain-Barre syndrome were often present when cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration was still normal. Extensive early fibrillations occurred in 10 patients, 6 of whom recovered well. Patients with early generalized slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity, combined abnormalities, or low muscle action potential amplitudes in ulnar, median, and peroneal nerves generally, but not always, had poorer outcomes than patients with conduction block in one nerve segment. There was no consistent relationship between results of electrophysiologic studies and overall clinical grade or limb power, except that none of the patients with an isolated proximal block had virtual or complete paralysis in the same limb.\r"

Patients were then crossed over, dose by dose, to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide and followed up for another 4 weeks. Dosing was single blind. The evaluation of the anticonvulsant effect was hampered by marked fluctuations in plasma levels during treatment with carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. There was, however, no significant change in seizure control. During epoxide treatment, no subjective side effects were reported despite epoxide plasma concentrations up to 57 mumol/L. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a significant improvement in finger motor speed and logical reasoning during the carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide period. Subnormal serum sodium levels in two patients were normalized after switching from carbamazepine to the epoxide. Continued investigations with this active metabolite of carbamazepine in epilepsy are therefore justified.\r"

The normal trend from multifocal innervation toward unifocal innervation was decreased in innervated MA muscle fibers. Microelectrode studies compared parameters of cultured aneural muscle fibers and cultured innervated-contracting muscle fibers from 7 patients with MA and 10 control patients. The mean resting membrane potentials of the two groups (aneurally cultured MA muscle fibers and innervated-contracting cultured MA muscle fibers) were 8 and 9 mV lower, respectively, than those of their counterpart controls. The mean amplitude of action potentials, the maximum rate of rise of action potentials in innervated MA muscle fibers, and the action potential amplitude in aneural MA muscle fibers were significantly smaller than in corresponding control fibers.\r"

Reliabilities of region of interest measurements for left and right anterior and posterior width and area, length of the bilateral insular region, and length of the bilateral planum temporale were excellent. Both the dyslexic and ADD/H children had significantly smaller right anterior-width measurements than did normal subjects. The dyslexics also had a bilaterally smaller insular region and significantly smaller left planum temporale than did the normal subjects. Seventy percent of the normal and ADD/H children had the expected left greater than right pattern of plana asymmetry, while only 10% of the dyslexic children did. The very significant increase in the incidence of plana symmetry or reversed asymmetry seems unique to dyslexia and may be related to deviations in normal patterns of corticogenesis. Although significantly more dyslexic children were left-handed than were the normal and ADD/H children, no significant relationship emerged between left-handedness, incidence of allergies or familial autoimmune disease, and variability in indexes of brain morphologic findings.\r"

We used an ELISA with an antibody raised against T alpha 1 to investigate the relationship between intracellular levels of thymosin immunoreactive peptide(s) (TIP) and cell proliferation in a rat small intestinal IEC-6 cell line. Increasing TIP levels were observed during cell proliferation, which decreased when proliferation was halted by cellular contact inhibition. Serum feeding of cells previously rendered quiescent by serum starvation resulted in a significant increase in TIP within 1 hr. Conversely, serum starvation decreased TIP levels within 1 hr. Peak TIP levels appeared after 3 hr of serum incubation, while maximum [3H]thymidine incorporation was noted after 9 hr, suggesting maximum TIP concentrations in the G1 phase of the proliferative cycle. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated an association of TIP with condensed nuclear chromatin. These results support a relation of intracellular TIP levels to IEC-6 cell proliferation and also a nuclear site of action. HPLC analysis of cellular homogenates from proliferating IEC-6 cells revealed a peak of immune reactivity that elutes in the position of T alpha 1.\r"

Subjects are 219 men and 162 women who were interviewed while in treatment for alcohol-related problems in nine different treatment programs in Contra Costa county, California. Tests of hypotheses supporting a single factor and a dual factor structure of dependence were rejected by confirmatory factor analysis. Results from exploratory factor analysis show a four factor structure for the concept of dependence in DSM-III-R. For ICD-10 there is a four factor solution among men and a three factor solution among women. The item composition of these factors vary by gender and across the two classifications. However, there is good agreement between dependence as measured by DSM-III-R and ICD-10 criteria. Since work on DSM-IV is now under way, the present research aims to provide some empirical base for how future changes should be made.\r"

In addition, entrants aged 55-64 who reported the next lower degree of this vigorous aerobic exercise had rates less than two thirds of the remainder; entrants of 45-54 did not show such an effect. When these forms of exercise were not vigorous they were no protection against the disease, nor were other forms of exercise or high totals of physical activity per se. A history of vigorous sports in the past was not protective. Indications in these men are of protection by specific exercise: vigorous, aerobic, with a threshold of intensity for benefit and \"dose response\" above this threshold, exercise that has to be habitual, and continuing, which suggests that protection is against the acute phases of the disease. Those men who took vigorous aerobic exercise were demonstrably a favourably \"selected\" group; they suffered less of the disease, however, whether at low risk or high by the several risk factors that were studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 51 patients in whom infarction was diagnosed during the first 24 hours after admission had a higher prevalence of ST elevation (64% v 11%), higher median serum myoglobin (136 micrograms/l v 34 micrograms/l), higher serum creatine kinase (77 IU/l v 34 IU/l), and higher MB isoenzyme (7 IU/l v 4 IU/l) than those in whom it was not. Stepwise logistic regression analysis in 70 patients in whom the electrocardiogram and serum myoglobin were suitable for analysis showed that serum myoglobin was the variable most closely associated with infarction, and contributed additional diagnostic information when ST elevation was entered into the model first. Serum myoglobin remained associated with myocardial infarction when patients who had had symptoms for less than six hours were analysed. An algorithm based on a rapid agglutination test for myoglobin and ST elevation on the electrocardiogram gave an accurate diagnosis in 82% of patients. This approach gave early and rapid recognition of acute myocardial infarction and warrants further examination.\r"

Forty six patients (41 men and five women; mean age 56 years) were allocated into two groups based on the extent of precordial ST segment depression: widespread (V1-V6) ST depression v localised (V1-V4) ST depression. Patients with no reciprocal ST depression or patients with ST depression in V1-V4 but with ST elevation in V5 and V6 (inferolateral acute myocardial infarction) were excluded. All patients were catheterised during hospital admission for infarction. Twenty four of the 28 patients with ST depression in V1-V6 had significant lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery whereas 16 of the 18 patients with ST depression in V1-V4 had insignificant or no lesions in the left anterior descending artery. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of widespread ST depression in predicting disease in the left anterior descending coronary artery were 92%, 80%, and 86% and 89% respectively. In patients with inferior acute myocardial infarction and precordial ST depression, the extent of ST depression is of clinical significance. Widespread (V1-V6) ST depression suggests disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery, whereas localised ST depression (V1-V4) indicates its absence.\r"

  ".W": "Homogeneity of recovery time protects against arrhythmias whereas dispersion of recovery time is arrhythmogenic. A single surface electrocardiographic QT interval gives no information on recovery time dispersion but the difference between the maximum and minimum body surface QT interval may be relevant. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the dispersion of the corrected QT interval (QTc) in 10 patients with an arrhythmogenic long QT interval (Romano Ward and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndromes or drug arrhythmogenicity) and in 14 patients without arrhythmias in whom the QT interval was prolonged by sotalol. QTc dispersion was significantly greater in the arrhythmogenic QT group than in the sotalol QT group. In patients with prolonged QT intervals, QT dispersion distinguished between those with ventricular arrhythmias and those without. This supports the hypothesis that QT dispersion reflects spatial differences in myocardial recovery time. QT dispersion may be useful in the assessment of both arrhythmia risk and the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The total surgical experience of a supraregional paediatric cardiology unit over a nine year period (January 1980 to December 1988) was reviewed to assess the effect of the introduction of the full range of ultrasound techniques. A total of 1517 patients underwent cardiac surgery (955 cardiopulmonary bypass, 562 closed procedures). Of these, 485 patients (32%) did not undergo cardiac catheterisation before operation: 217 bypass (23% of all procedures under cardiopulmonary bypass) and 268 closed procedures (48%). The overall ratio of catheterisations to operations for patients undergoing palliative or corrective surgery fell from 0.97 (1980) to 0.38 (1988). The patients were classified as (a) neonates (0-28 days), (b) infants (one to 12 months), and (c) children (one to 14 years). The main impact of non-invasive surgical referral was in neonates (total catheter:operation ratio 0.38; neonates 0.2 for 1988). The surgical population was further divided according to the principal echocardiographic technique available: (a) 1980-4 cross sectional imaging; (b) 1985-6; imaging plus spectral Doppler ultrasound; (c) 1987-8; imaging plus spectral Doppler ultrasound and colour flow mapping. A fall in the catheter:operation ratio for all age groups was most pronounced in the last four years. This reflects increased familiarity and surgical confidence with non-invasive diagnostic assessment. The introduction of each new echocardiographic technique was associated with a significant fall in the total catheter:operation ratio compared with the preceding period. Six incorrect ultrasound diagnoses were made during the entire period; one of these patients died in the early postoperative period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left ventricular and right ventricular cavity dimensions and the shape and size of the mitral valve annulus and aortic root were recorded and presented both as absolute values (mm) and corrected for body surface area (mm/m2). Logistic regression was used to produce a classification rule to estimate the probability of a neonate having hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The diameter of the mitral valve annulus was the single most discriminative variable. There was, however, considerable overlap of all the calculated features between neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and those with other causes of right ventricular overload. The diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome should not be based on any one single echocardiographic feature but the general appearance of abnormal left heart valves, small cavity dimensions, and the size of the mitral valve annulus.\r"

Dilatation was successful in 11 (73%) patients. The mean balloon to annulus ratio was 1.1 (range 0.6-1.77). The ratio of right ventricle to femoral artery systolic pressure decreased from a mean (1 SD) of 1.4 (0.32) before to 0.8 (0.24) after dilatation and the transvalvar gradient decreased from 81 (29.7) mm Hg before to 33 (27.7) mm Hg after dilatation. All four (27%) patients in whom dilatation was unsuccessful underwent surgical valvotomy. Complications of balloon dilatation occurred in three (20%) patients; these included retroperitoneal haematoma (one) and iliofemoral venous occlusion (two). In one (7%) patient severe hypoxia and hypotension developed when the valve was crossed with a guide wire and balloon catheter. Despite successful dilatation he died 7 days after the procedure. During a mean (1 SD) follow up of 2 (1.7) years, seven (64%) of the 11 patients remained free of important restenosis. One patient required repeat dilatation three weeks after the initial procedure. In three (27%) patients restenosis developed 4-9 months after dilatation and all three had surgical valvotomy. Of the four patients initially referred for surgery three required a second operation and one required balloon dilatation. Percutaneous balloon dilatation gave effective relief of critical pulmonary stenosis in most neonates but complications and restenosis requiring surgery were common.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether coronary vasodilator reserve that persists during myocardial ischemia is present in all left ventricular regions, we measured regional blood flow in 192 left ventricular pieces (mean weight, 201 mg) in each of eight dogs by using radioactive microspheres while perfusing the left main coronary artery at 70, 50, 40, and 30 mm Hg. Flows were measured before and during adenosine infusion to determine flow reserve. Perfusion at 40 and 30 mm Hg produced ischemia in all dogs. At 70 mm Hg, 100% of left ventricular regions had significant flow reserve, compared with 92%, 55%, and 8% during perfusion at 50, 40, and 30 mm Hg, respectively. A greater amount of flow reserve and a greater number of regions responded to adenosine in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium at 50, 40, and 30 mm Hg. We conclude that coronary flow reserve persists in only a subset of left ventricular regions during ischemia and that the number of regions with persistent flow reserve decreases with perfusion pressure. These findings may best be explained by a model in which regional ischemia is a maximal coronary vasodilator and persistent pharmacological vasodilator reserve seen when global markers indicate ischemia simply reflects persistent endogenous flow reserve in myocardial regions not yet ischemic.\r"

In addition, the effects of micropressure injections of AVP into the area postrema on RSNA, arterial pressure, heart rate, and baroreflex control of RSNA were evaluated. Injection of 100 ng (in a 10-nl volume) of AVP antagonist into the area postrema abolished the ability of AVP to enhance baroreflex inhibition of RSNA compared with phenylephrine (-8.84 +/- 0.89 before antagonist versus -4.83 +/- 0.44 %RSNA/mm Hg after antagonist). Normal baroreflex inhibition to phenylephrine (-3.95 +/- 0.26 versus -4.10 +/- 0.33 %RSNA/mm Hg) was unaltered. This dose of AVP antagonist given intravenously or into the adjacent medial nucleus tractus solitarius was without effect. Micropressure injection of AVP directly into the area postrema produced a dose-dependent decrease in RSNA without significant effects on arterial pressure or heart rate. Local injection of 4 +/- 0.6 ng (in a 4-nl volume) of AVP produced an average 27 +/- 3% decrease in resting RSNA. Continuous injection of AVP into the area postrema using short-duration, low-frequency pressure pulses significantly augmented the baroreflex inhibition of RSNA during phenylephrine infusion (during AVP injection, -7.12 +/- 1.60%RSNA/mm Hg; control, -3.38 +/- 0.55 %RSNA/mm Hg). These data support the hypothesis that circulating AVP acts at the area postrema to augment baroreflex inhibition of RSNA by a V1 receptor mechanism.\r"

Micromolar concentrations of doxorubicin and other anthracyclines at the cytosolic face of the channel significantly and reversibly increase the open probability of single channels in artificial phospholipid bilayers. Lifetime analysis shows that anthracyclines and calcium are synergistic activators of the calcium-release channel. Radiolabeled ryanodine binding suggests that all the anthracyclines studied are equally potent as channel activators in vitro. Mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione derivative, variably increases channel open probability at low (1-10 microM) concentrations. Higher concentrations are associated with the appearance of channel currents with lower amplitudes than the fully open state, and normal openings are reduced in frequency. At these concentrations, the interaction of mitoxantrone with the channel reduces the level of ryanodine binding. Abnormal function of the cardiac calcium-release channel will alter calcium handling within the myocyte and may be the basis for anthraquinone-related cardiotoxicity.\r"

  ".U": "90329677\r", 
  ".W": "Slowing in conduction and functional block in the epicardial tissue overlying a region of transmural necrosis are pivotal in the genesis of many lethal arrhythmias during the healing phase of myocardial infarction. The mechanisms responsible for these alterations in conduction in the epicardial region have not been completely elucidated. In the present study, the microscopic abnormalities in conduction were investigated in vitro using high-density mapping with 224 bipolar electrodes (interelectrode distance, 350 microns) in isolated epicardial tissue excised from the hearts of dogs 2 weeks after anterior myocardial infarction. Seven epicardial tissue slices (group 1) exhibited uninterrupted sequential activation after stimulation at the basic cycle length as well as after premature stimuli. Four tissues (group 2) demonstrated microscopic alterations in conduction both during basic drive and premature stimuli, with the extent of conduction delay dependent on the stimulation site. In three tissues (group 3), the activation sequence was normal during the basic drive but became abnormal after premature stimulation, with the appearance of functional block in the direction transverse to fiber orientation. Superfusion with isoproterenol (10(-6) M) did not significantly modify resting membrane potential, amplitude, or maximum rate change of voltage (Vmax) of phase 0 depolarization but decreased action potential duration. Isoproterenol did not alter the activation sequence during basic drive, but it reduced the slowing in conduction elicited by premature stimulation in group 1 (p less than 0.01 in the transverse direction), alleviated microcircuitous conduction in group 2, and prevented the occurrence of functional block in tissues in group 3. Despite this salutary effect on conduction velocity, arrhythmias occurred after isoproterenol because of focal activity (three of 14, 21%) or reentry (one of 14, 7%) at very short coupling intervals of premature stimulation. These findings indicate that microscopic abnormalities in conduction occur in response to premature stimulation in epicardial regions overlying an infarct, eliciting conduction block that is more prone to occur in the direction transverse to fiber orientation and is dependent on the direction of activation. beta-Adrenergic stimulation prevents or attenuates the alterations in the pattern of activation elicited by premature stimulation. However, this potential beneficial effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation is offset by the occurrence of focal activity and reentry at short coupling intervals of premature stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "A recent study suggested that exposure of carotid sinus baroreceptors to pulsatile pressures for a period of minutes can decrease the static threshold pressure at which they begin to discharge; that is, the exposure can sensitize baroreceptors. Another study found that the rapid resetting of carotid sinus baroreceptors to elevated conditioning pressures was reduced or eliminated by pulsatile conditioning. In the present study, we tested the responses of aortic baroreceptors in an in vitro preparation to a range of static and dynamic conditioning pressures lasting 15 minutes. Slow test ramps of increasing pressure were used to assess static discharge properties (threshold and gain). To be accepted for analysis (n = 12), each baroreceptor had to successfully complete static and dynamic test sequences for at least three different conditioning mean arterial pressure levels. We measured aortic diameter simultaneously with pressure and baroreceptor discharge. Generally, we found no significant difference between the static pressure threshold measured before and after dynamic conditioning. The static pressure threshold was linearly related to the mean level of the conditioning pressure, and no differences in the slopes of these relations (a measure of the ability of a baroreceptor to rapidly reset) were found between static and dynamic conditioning. After dynamic conditioning, discharge rates returned to near control levels in all cases within a few seconds of the return to static conditioning. Two baroreceptors exposed to the vasodilator nitroprusside throughout the experiment showed similar results. Diameter measurements indicated no role of vessel diameter changes during dynamic or static conditioning. In conclusion, we found no evidence of a long-lasting sensitization of aortic baroreceptors by dynamic pressure inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of thrombosis on vascular tone in vivo, using small mesenteric arteries of rats (about 300 microns i.d.) and a video recording system attached to a microscope. To induce thrombosis we damaged the vessel wall over a short segment by compression and exposed the media to the bloodstream. A thrombus mainly consisting of platelets gradually enlarged at the damaged site and caused 50-100% narrowing of the lumen. The diameter at the site downstream from the thrombus did not change as long as the blood flow was not interrupted. Instead, vasoconstrictor response to serotonin (3.0 and 30 micrograms/ml) or norepinephrine (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 microgram/ml) given topically was significantly inhibited at the site downstream from the thrombus compared with that at the upstream site (p less than 0.01). Nonthrombotic mechanical narrowing of the vascular lumen did not affect vascular constriction by these agents. After damage to the endothelium by intra-arterial infusion of a detergent (0.3% CHAPS), the inhibition of the constrictor response by the thrombus was no longer observed. Once the thrombus occluded the vascular lumen and the blood flow was interrupted, the diameter at the downstream site declined markedly, from 291 +/- 22 to 77 +/- 21 microns (mean +/- SEM, n = 7, p less than 0.01) even without endothelial damage. Mechanical nonthrombotic occlusion of the vascular lumen induced only a small diameter reduction to 241 +/- 16 microns. We conclude that a partially occlusive thrombus may release a material that inhibits vascular constriction by serotonin or norepinephrine through an endothelium-dependent mechanism and that an occlusive thrombus induces constriction of the downstream vascular bed even with endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the ability of individual regions of the canine left ventricle to increase blood flow relative to baseline rates of perfusion. Regional coronary flow was measured by injecting radioactive microspheres over 90 seconds in seven anesthetized mongrel dogs. Preliminary experiments demonstrated a correlation between the regional distributions of blood flow during asphyxia and pharmacological vasodilatation with adenosine (mean r = 0.75; 192 regions in each of two dogs), both of which resulted in increased coronary flow. Subsequent experiments, during which coronary perfusion pressure was held constant at 80 mm Hg, examined the pattern of blood flow in 384 regions (mean weight, 106 mg) of the left ventricular free wall during resting flow and during maximal coronary flow effected by intracoronary adenosine infusion. We found that resting and maximal flow patterns were completely uncorrelated to each other in a given dog (mean r = 0.06, p = NS; n = 3 dogs). Furthermore, regional coronary reserve, defined as the ratio of maximal to resting flow, ranged from 1.75 (i.e., resting flow was 57% of maximum) to 21.9 (resting flow was 4.5% of maximum). Thus, coronary reserve is spatially heterogeneous and determined by two distinct perfusion patterns: the resting (control) pattern and the maximal perfusion pattern. Normal hearts, therefore, contain small regions that may be relatively more vulnerable to ischemia. This may explain the patchy nature of infarction with hypoxia and at reduced perfusion pressures as well as the difficulty of using global parameters to predict regional ischemia. Despite the wide dispersion of coronary reserve, we found, by autocorrelation analysis, that reserve in neighboring regions (even when separated by a distance of several tissue samples) was significantly correlated. This also applied to patterns of resting myocardial flow. Thus, both resting coronary blood flow and reserve appear to be locally continuous and may define functional zones of vascular control and vulnerability, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion after brief, reversible myocardial ischemia is associated with prolonged depression of contractile function (myocardial \"stunning\"); however, the effect on coronary vascular function has not been defined. Thus, open-chest dogs (n = 14) underwent a 15-minute left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by reflow. Four hours after reperfusion, regional myocardial blood flow (microspheres) was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower and coronary vascular resistance significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in the postischemic as compared with the nonischemic endocardium. Furthermore, during maximal vasodilation elicited by intravenous adenosine (n = 6), myocardial blood flow was lower (p less than 0.05) and coronary vascular resistance higher (p less than 0.05) in the postischemic as compared with the nonischemic myocardium, both in the endocardial and in the epicardial layers. Similarly, during maximal dilation elicited by intravenous papaverine (n = 8), myocardial blood flow was lower (p less than 0.05) and vascular resistance higher (p less than 0.05) in the postischemic as compared with the nonischemic endocardium; a directionally similar trend was observed in the epicardium. Four hours after reperfusion, all indexes of reactive hyperemia after a 40-second coronary occlusion were significantly lower in the LAD than in the control circumflex coronary artery (n = 8). There was no appreciable correlation between systolic wall thickening in the stunned myocardium and 1) the resting myocardial perfusion, 2) the hyperemia attained during adenosine or papaverine, and 3) the hyperemic response to a 40-second coronary occlusion. In control dogs that did not undergo a 15-minute LAD occlusion (n = 15), there were no differences in myocardial blood flow or vascular resistance between the LAD-dependent and the circumflex-dependent bed, either before or during adenosine (n = 7) or papaverine (n = 8). Furthermore, reactive hyperemia after a 40-second occlusion did not differ between the LAD and the circumflex artery (n = 8). In conclusion, a brief (15 minute), reversible ischemic insult causes a prolonged increase in resting vascular resistance and a prolonged impairment in vasodilator responsiveness, both of which persist for at least 4 hours. The severity of these vascular derangements is not related to the severity of contractile depression, suggesting that they may represent a relatively independent phenomenon. It is proposed that, in addition to myocardial \"stunning,\" reversible ischemia also causes a microvascular \"stunning.\"\r"

We tested whether thyroid state affects expression of TNI using neonatal and adult rats made hypothyroid by treatment with 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil. Polyacrylamide gels of myofibrils from hearts of 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day-old animals indicated that both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats display a developmental shift toward the adult form of TNI. However, hypothyroid rats displayed a lower percentage of adult TNI at each age studied. When adult rats were made hypothyroid, the proportion of adult TNI decreased slightly. Thin-filament activity was determined from measurements of the effect of acidic pH on calcium activation of myofibrillar ATPase activity. Sensitivity to acidic pH was measured by the magnitude of shift in pCa50 (-log of half-maximally activating molar Ca2+) between pH 7.0 and 6.5. Euthyroid rats displayed developmental increases in pH sensitivity. At 7, 14, and 28 days of development, shifts in pCa50 were 0.11, 0.38, and 0.43 units, respectively. Hypothyroid rats displayed less pH sensitivity with pCa50 shifts of 0.07, 0.21, and 0.15 units at 7, 14, and 28 days of development. Adult hypothyroid rats displayed a 0.38-unit shift in pCa50, whereas euthyroid adults displayed a 0.44-unit shift. Our results indicate that pH sensitivity and expression of cardiac TNI are influenced by developmental stage and hormonal status.\r"

  ".W": "The viscoelastic model of the ventricle predicts that the rate of change of volume (strain rate) is a determinant of the instantaneous pressure in the ventricle during diastole. Because relaxation is not complete before the onset of filling, one cannot distinguish the individual effects of relaxation and viscosity unless the passive and active components that determine the ventricular pressure are separated. To overcome this problem, we used the method of ventricular volume clamping to compare the pressures in the fully relaxed ventricle at a given volume at zero strain rate (static pressure) and high strain rate (dynamic pressure). Six open-chest, fentanyl-anesthetized dogs were instrumented with micromanometers and an electronically controlled mitral valve occluder in series with the electromagnetic flow probe. We reasoned as follows: If there were significant viscosity, then the dynamic pressure would be higher than the static pressure. The static pressure was measured when the ventricle was completely relaxed following a mitral valve occlusion after an arbitrary filling volume had been achieved. The dynamic pressure was determined by delaying the onset of filling until relaxation was complete and then measuring the pressure at the same volume that was achieved when the static pressure was measured. In 19 different hemodynamic situations, the dynamic and static pressures were identical (mean difference, 0.1 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), indicating that in the passive ventricle viscoelastic effects are insignificant and do not contribute to the left ventricular diastolic pressure under normal filling rates.\r"

T lymphocytes are known to recognize antigen-presenting cells, such as virus-infected cells, being restricted by syngeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. To clarify in more detail the immunological mechanisms involved, we induced acute viral myocarditis in C3H/He mouse ventricles with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and examined, by immunofluorescence, the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, previously reported not to be expressed by normal cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, to confirm the expression of MHC class I (H-2Kk) antigens at the cellular level, we treated cultured cardiac myocytes with interferon gamma and examined the antigen expression by immunofluorescence and Northern blot hybridization, using an antisense RNA probe for MHC messenger RNA. Our observations demonstrated 1) CVB3-induced myocarditis resulted in the enhanced expression of MHC class I (H-2Kk) gene product on the surface of cardiac myocytes but low or undetectable levels of MHC class II or H-2Dk gene products, and moderate focal transient (days 5-7) expression of both MHC class I (Kk + Dk) region gene products and MHC class II antigens were induced on capillary endothelial cells; 2) murine fetal cardiac myocytes cultured in vitro in the presence of interferon gamma similarly were shown to express marked levels of MHC class I (H-2Kk) but low to undetectable levels of the H-2Dk gene product; however, weak to moderate MHC Class II antigens were expressed by these cultured myocytes; and 3) the expression of MHC antigens in cardiac myocytes was modulated at the transcriptional level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intimal plaques were produced by endothelial balloon denudation of the thoracic aorta and a 1% cholesterol diet. After a steady intravenous infusion of 200 microCi of [14C]antipyrine for 60 seconds, thoracic and abdominal aortas and the heart were excised, and autoradiograms of 20-microns-thick sections were quantified, using microcomputer-aided densitometry. Regional radioactivity and regional diffusional support, as an index of nutritional flow estimated from the timed collections of arterial blood, was 367 and 421 nCi.g-1 (82 and 106 ml.min-1.100 g-1) in thoracic aortic media of the normal and atherosclerotic rabbits, respectively. Radioactivity at the thickened intima was 179 nCi.g-1 (p less than 0.01 versus media). The gruel was noted at a deeper site within the thickened intima, and diffusional support here was 110 nCi.g-1 (p less than 0.01 versus an average radioactivity at the thickened intima). After ligating the intercostal arteries, regional tracer distribution in the media beneath the fibrofatty lesion, but not the plaque-free intima, was reduced to 46%. Thus, in the presence of advanced intimal thickening, the heterogeneous distribution of diffusional flow is prominent across the vessel wall, and abluminal routes are crucial to meet the increased demands of nutritional requirements.\r"

However, effects of fibrillation duration on relative efficacy of monophasic and biphasic waveforms are unknown. This study used a newly developed defibrillation model, the isolated right- and left-sided working rabbit heart, with epicardial defibrillation electrodes, to compare threshold for a monophasic waveform (5 msec rectangular) and an asymmetrical biphasic waveform (5 msec each pulse, V2 = 50% V1). Mean voltage defibrillation threshold (V50) was determined from sigmoidal probability of successful defibrillation versus shock intensity curves after 5, 15, and 30 seconds of fibrillation in a paired study with 10 hearts. Results showed that biphasic waveforms had significantly lower voltage and energy thresholds at all fibrillation durations and that their relative efficacy improved with increasing fibrillation duration. Biphasic voltage threshold was 38.2 +/- 2.2, 44.7 +/- 4.8, and 46.6 +/- 3.2 V after 5, 15, and 30 seconds of fibrillation compared with monophasic thresholds of 51.7 +/- 4.4 (p less than 0.002), 63.0 +/- 7.6 (p less than 0.05), and 72.1 +/- 3.9 V (p less than 0.005). Biphasic waveform energy threshold was 0.67 that for the monophasic waveform after 5 seconds of fibrillation (0.12 +/- 0.01 versus 0.18 +/- 0.03 J, p less than 0.05). The ratio between biphasic waveform threshold and monophasic waveform threshold (B/M) decreased to 0.62 at 15 seconds. At 30 seconds, B/M was 0.52 (0.17 +/- 0.02 versus 0.33 +/- 0.04 J, p less than 0.02). This study also showed that biphasic waveform threshold was a nonlinear function of monophasic waveform threshold so that improved biphasic defibrillator waveform efficacy was greatest for hearts having higher monophasic thresholds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control hearts were perfused with an inactive phorbol ester (4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate), which does not cause activation of protein kinase C. To ensure the blockade of different receptor systems, the perfusions were carried out in the presence of prazosin, propranolol, and atropine. Perfusion of hearts with either PMA (4 microM) or D8G (200 microM) was associated with a negative effect on left ventricular inotropy and relaxation. Examination of the 32P incorporation into various fractions revealed that there were no increases in the degree of phosphorylation of phospholamban in sarcoplasmic reticulum, and troponin I and C protein in the myofibrils, although these proteins were found to be substrates for protein kinase C in vitro. However, in the same hearts, there were significant changes in the 32P incorporation into a 28-kDa cytosolic-protein. Examination of the activity levels of protein kinase C in hearts perfused with PMA indicated a redistribution of this activity from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction, suggesting the activation of the enzyme in vivo. These findings indicate that cardiac regulatory phosphoproteins, which may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro, are not substrates for protein kinase C in beating hearts perfused with phorbol esters or diacylglycerol analogues.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of chronic exposure of cultured atrial myocytes to R-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (R-PIA) on the A1 adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and myocyte contractility were examined. Chronic exposure of atrial myocytes cultured from 14-day-old chick embryos to R-PIA desensitized the myocyte to the inhibitory effects of R-PIA on contractility and adenylate cyclase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Desensitization of the negative inotropic response was only partial, whereas the adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was almost completely absent after 24 hours of R-PIA (1 microM) exposure. Furthermore, the contractile response to R-PIA desensitized more slowly than the desensitization of A1 adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase (t1/2 = 11.4 +/- 0.7 hours versus 7.5 +/- 1 hours, mean +/- SEM, n = 12 and 6, respectively). Thus, the two A1 adenosine receptor-linked functional responses desensitized differently in response to chronic exposure of the myocyte to R-PIA. Binding of the antagonist radioligand [3H]-8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine [( 3H]CPX) in membranes from myocytes preexposed to R-PIA demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in receptor density without any change in the affinity for the antagonist radioligand. Computer analyses of agonist competition with [3H]CPX binding in membranes from control and R-PIA-treated myocytes revealed a conversion of the high-affinity A1 adenosine receptor to a low-affinity form such that after 24 hours of 1 microM R-PIA exposure, all of the receptors were in a low-affinity form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In studies that attempt to measure intracellular calcium [( Ca2+]i) in the intact heart with the calcium indicator indo 1-AM, a fundamental assumption is that the signals report changes in myocyte [Ca2+]i. We studied isolated perfused rabbit hearts loaded with the calcium probe indo 1-AM and recorded surface fluorescence of the left ventricle during continuous excitation at 360 nm. In cells containing indo 1, an increase in [Ca2+]i is associated with an increase in fluorescence intensity at 400 nm, a decrease in intensity at 500 nm, and an increase in the 400:500 nm ratio. Beat-to-beat fluorescence transients were recorded from the surface of the heart coincident with contraction, indicating that a component of the fluorescence signals is derived from beating myocytes. To evaluate the potential contribution of endothelial cells, we compared the response to increases in [Ca2+]o or bradykinin (10(-5) M). In response to an increase of the [Ca2+] in the perfusate from 0.6 to 3.0 mM, left ventricular developed pressure and +dP/dt increased with a simultaneous increase in the [Ca2+]i-sensitive 400:500 nm ratio. Perfusion with the endothelial cell agonist bradykinin caused no change in left ventricular isovolumic peak systolic pressure or left ventricular dP/dt, whereas bradykinin evoked an immediate elevation in both the diastolic and systolic levels of the [Ca2+]i-sensitive 400:500 nm ratio. In additional experiments with indo 1-loaded isolated beating myocytes, superfusion with bradykinin had no effect on either the fluorescence [Ca2+]i transients or contractility. In contrast, superfusion of indo 1-loaded cultured endothelial cells with bradykinin caused the elevation of [Ca2+]i within seconds. Fluorescence microscopy of unstained frozen tissue sections from indo 1-loaded hearts also suggested the presence of more intense microvascular endothelial cell indo 1 fluorescence relative to that observed in myocytes. These experiments provide evidence that a component of [Ca2+]i-sensitive fluorescence of whole hearts loaded with indo 1 is contributed by nonmyocyte sources, including endothelial cells. These results also raise the caution that the abrupt rise of [Ca2+]i that has been observed during the initial phase of ischemia in whole hearts loaded with indo 1 may be partly derived from endothelial cells rather than myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "During systole a small portion of the mainstream aortic flow is intercepted by the sinus ridge, or downstream corner of the sinus of Valsalva. This fluid curls back toward the ventricle to form a large eddy, or vortex, that spins within the sinus cavity. The fluid motion within similar recirculating flows is known to be unstable with an early transition to turbulence. The stability of the aortic sinus vortex was examined in the current study in an in vitro pulsatile flow rig. The geometry of the experimental test section was the same as the geometry of the natural aortic root. Different model valves, including a natural valve, were placed in the test section, and different flow conditions were studied. Point velocities were measured by hot film probes placed at two locations within the sinus vortex. The velocity waveforms and their power spectra were used to determine the stability of the sinus flow. The experimental results revealed that the aortic sinus vortex becomes turbulent under simulated exercise conditions. Turbulent intensities were highest near the sinus ridge, which is the location of the coronary ostia. Despite the transition to turbulence within the vortex, the mainstream aortic flow upstream from the valve remained laminar. The turbulence within the vortex was also associated with vibration of the valve leaflets under exercise conditions. These vibrations may be related to the systolic ejection murmurs that are heard clinically. Furthermore, the localized turbulence may explain the location of atherosclerotic lesions and dissecting aneurysms, as well as the distribution of the lesions of bacterial endocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms of blockade of two types of Ca2+ channels by the organic Ca2+ antagonists, nicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, and flunarizine, were examined in rat aorta smooth muscle cells in primary culture by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. T-type Ca2+ current (T-type ICa) was isolated by an internal perfusion of 5 mM F-, which irreversibly suppressed the L-type ICa, without affecting T-type ICa. L-type ICa was isolated by setting a holding potential at -60 mV, at which most of the T-type Ca2+ channels were inactivated. L-type ICa is halved by 0.1 microM nicardipine, 3.0 microM diltiazem, 0.6 microM verapamil, and 0.1 microM flunarizine, whereas T-type ICa is halved by the same drugs at 0.6, 30, 30, and 0.1 microM, respectively. Diltiazem and verapamil accelerated the decay of L-type ICa and cumulatively blocked L-type ICa during repetitive step depolarizations elicited every 30 seconds (\"use-dependent block\"). Diltiazem and verapamil neither changed the decay of T-type ICa nor showed a use-dependent block of T-type ICa. Nicardipine and flunarizine blocked both L- and T-type ICa from the first depolarization step after drug treatment (\"tonic block\") and shifted their steady-state inactivation curves to the left. The estimated binding constants of nicardipine and flunarizine for the inactivated state of T-type Ca2+ channels (48 and 19 nM, respectively) were smaller than those for the resting state of L-type Ca2+ channels (160 and 90 nM, respectively). A low concentration (0.1 microM) of nicardipine initially potentiated T-type ICa and then reduced it. We conclude from these results that 1) nicardipine and flunarizine block not only the resting state but, more preferentially, the inactivated state of both the L- and T-type Ca2+ channels; 2) verapamil and diltiazem preferentially act on the open state of the L-type Ca2+ channel and on the resting and inactivated state of the T-type Ca2+ channel; and 3) the T-type Ca2+ channel of the rat aorta smooth muscle cells appears to be more sensitive to nicardipine and flunarizine than does the L-type Ca2+ channel at around the resting membrane potential.\r"

  ".W": "A burst of free oxygen radical production has been demonstrated during the early moments of reperfusion, coincident with the onset of reperfusion arrhythmias, which can be attenuated by antioxidants. We have investigated whether a sudden burst of oxidant stress, superimposed on that occurring during reperfusion, can exacerbate reperfusion arrhythmias. Rat hearts (n = 12/group) were subjected to 12 minutes of aerobic perfusion; during the last 2 minutes, rose bengal (1 mumol/l) was added to the perfusion fluid. Then, regional ischemia was induced, and rose bengal-free perfusion was restored. After 5 minutes of ischemia, reperfusion was initiated for 5 minutes, and during the first 30 seconds of reperfusion, hearts were uniformly illuminated (8,500 lux) with green light (530-590 nm). The photoactivation of rose bengal trapped in the tissue, producing singlet oxygen and superoxide, resulted in an exacerbation of reperfusion arrhythmias. Thus, 92% of hearts developed ventricular premature beats, 83% ventricular tachycardia, and 33% ventricular fibrillation. In contrast, hearts with regional ischemia and reperfusion in the absence of rose bengal and/or illumination did not develop ventricular fibrillation; only one heart exhibited ventricular tachycardia, and the incidence of ventricular premature beats was lower (42-50%). Furthermore, the burst of oxidant stress shortened the time to onset of ventricular premature beats from 21.7 +/- 5.6 to 9.9 +/- 2.1 seconds. Additional studies revealed that rose bengal photoactivation without reperfusion was less arrhythmogenic compared with the combination of reperfusion plus photoactivation. These results demonstrate that a sudden burst of oxidant stress during the early moments of reperfusion can exacerbate the vulnerability to reperfusion arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism may be important in the regulation of myocardial contractile function during ischemia. This study sought to determine the dynamic relation between myocardial contractile function and high-energy phosphate metabolism during and following brief (24-second) coronary occlusion, when large and rapid changes in both parameters occur. Eight anesthetized, open-chest pigs were instrumented with a Doppler flow probe and occluder on the anterior descending coronary artery, segment length crystals in the anterior left ventricular wall, and a surface coil for phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Phosphorus-31 spectra were reconstructed with a 4.8-second time resolution by summing corresponding short blocks of data from multiple occlusions. Metabolic and functional parameters were unchanged during the first 4.8 seconds of occlusion. During the remainder of occlusion, phosphocreatine progressively declined to 66 +/- 3% of control, inorganic phosphate rose to 170 +/- 8% of control, and segment shortening fell to 25 +/- 9% of control. A strong linear correlation was found between dynamic changes in segment shortening and phosphocreatine (r2 = 0.97), inorganic phosphate (r2 = 0.96), and the ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (r2 = 0.98) during occlusion. At any level of the ratio between phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate, segment shortening was greater during reflow than during occlusion. The close, dynamic relation between segment shortening and phosphorus metabolites supports the regulation of contractility by changes in energy metabolism or its by-products during ischemia. During reactive hyperemia, the high coronary flow rate may be an independent factor modulating contractility.\r"

  ".W": "Important electrophysiological alterations that may predispose hearts to arrhythmias have been described for hypertrophied myocytes, and hypertrophy coupled with ischemia has been associated with an increased incidence of sudden death; however, an influence of hypertrophy on reperfusion arrhythmias has not been previously described. We hypothesized that reperfusion-associated arrhythmias would be potentiated by left ventricular hypertrophy. After induction of renovascular hypertension, 37 awake, unsedated dogs (17 with left ventricular hypertrophy and 20 without hypertrophy) underwent 15 minutes of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. All dogs were pretreated with lidocaine bolus injections and with lidocaine by continuous infusion during coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Reperfusion-associated ventricular fibrillation occurred in seven of 17 dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy versus one of 18 dogs without hypertrophy (p less than or equal to 0.05). The presence of hypertension was not significantly associated with an increased incidence of reflow ventricular arrhythmias. Neither QT interval nor area-at-risk was different between the dogs with and without reperfusion ventricular fibrillation; however, increased heart rate just before reperfusion did correlate with an increased incidence of ventricular fibrillation at reperfusion. Thus, 1) left ventricular hypertrophy was associated with a significantly increased incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation after 15 minutes of ischemia, 2) this increased incidence was independent of the presence of hypertension, and 3) lidocaine protected control and hypertrophied hearts against ventricular fibrillation during ischemia but was ineffective in protecting hypertrophied hearts against reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "Glandular kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.8) belongs to a subgroup of serine proteases coded by a multigene family. A kininogenase resembling glandular kallikrein has been identified in vascular tissue; however, it is not clear whether it is synthesized by vascular tissue or taken up from plasma. To determine the potential for kallikrein synthesis in vascular tissues, we tested whether messenger RNA (mRNA) for glandular kallikrein is present in rat arteries and veins. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from pools of arteries or veins (n = 3, 30 rats each). Poly(A+) RNA from the kidney and liver was used as a positive and negative control, respectively. As a probe, we used rat pancreatic kallikrein 32P-labeled complementary DNA, which recognizes mRNA of the entire rat kallikrein family. Slot-blot analysis indicated that kallikrein mRNA was present in mRNA from the arteries, veins, and kidney but not from the liver. Poly(A+) RNA from arteries and veins contained approximately 1% as much kallikrein mRNA as that from the kidney. To confirm the slot-blot results and determine whether the mRNA for true glandular kallikrein was present in vascular tissue, we employed a polymerase chain reaction assay, first using primers specific for the entire kallikrein family (which amplify a 430-bp fragment) and then using primers specific for true glandular kallikrein mRNA (which amplify a 370-bp fragment). After the polymerase chain reaction assay, both arteries and veins showed fragments of these sizes when tested with rat kallikrein complementary DNA probe, thus confirming the presence of glandular kallikrein mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Smooth muscle cells, dispersed from the circumflex coronary artery of the guinea pig, were studied with the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp. The resting potential of about -40 mV was superimposed by spikelike hyperpolarizations (SLHs) up to -20 mV amplitude. The SLHs resulted from spontaneous transient outward currents (spontaneous TOCs) measured under voltage-clamp (-40 or -50 mV). Acetylcholine (ACh; 10 microM) increased SLHs and TOCs in amplitude and frequency. Atropine blocked the ACh effects. ACh-induced SLHs or TOCs were suppressed by bath application of tetraethylammonium (1 or 10 mM) or by cell dialysis with cesium, suggesting that they result from induction of potassium currents. In cell-attached patches, induction of currents through 130-pS potassium channels was recorded when ACh was bath-applied. An ACh-induced increase in intracellular [Ca2+] is suggested as a second messenger since SHLs and TOCs were suppressed by cell dialysis of 10 mM EGTA. ACh induced SHLs and TOCs in the absence of extracellular calcium. Intracellular application of 5 mg/ml heparin blocked ACh-induced TOCs. When the intracellular calcium stores were depleted by pretreatment with caffeine, the ACh effects were suppressed. Similarly, ACh pretreatment reduced the caffeine-induced outward currents. The results suggested that ACh augments calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the released calcium activates maxi potassium channels. In the single cell, calcium-activated potassium channels generate TOCs and SLHs that sum up to a hyperpolarization of the multicellular tissue.\r"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the sera drawn from 45 patients with chronic renal failure, 39 of them on chronic hemodialysis (duration 1-17 years). Serum samples were tested for 15 autoantibodies, no antinuclear antibodies or antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens could be detected; all sera were also negative for antibodies to dsDNA, mitochondria, gastric parietal cells and smooth muscle. In contrast a high incidence of antibodies to cytoskeletal components could be demonstrated using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that employed purified antigens. Antibodies of IgG-type (IgM-type shown in brackets) were detected against cytokeratin in 51.3% (15.4%), actin in 17.9% (5.1%), desmin in 28.2% (17.9%), vimentin in 15.4% (5.1%) and tropomyosin in 12.8% (5.1%) of the sera of patients on chronic hemodialysis. No association with diagnosis, duration of hemodialysis, age or interdialytic changes of body weight and antibody titers could be found. In a control group of 82 healthy blood donors no antibodies were detected. Positive correlations of incidence of antibodies to actin, desmin, vimentin and keratin suggests polyclonal activation of immune system in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis. The mechanism is unknown.\r"

In the normal subjects there was no change in systolic blood pressure (SBP), a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (9 +/- 1 mmHg, mean + SEM, p less than 0.01), heart rate (HR) (11 +/- 2 beats/min) and derived peripheral resistance (PR) (66 +/- 8%, p less than 0.001). Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) fell significantly by 42 +/- 3% and 33 +/- 3%, respectively. The responses in Group 2 patients were similar to those of the controls. However in Group 1 patients, though there was a rise in heart rate (9 +/- 2, p less than 0.001), SBP fell significantly accompanied by no change in either DBP or PR. The decrease in SV was only 12 +/- 4% while there was no change in derived CO. The results suggest that there was a lack of vasoconstriction during postural stress in patients with endstage renal failure, which was probably due to a functional defect in the baroreceptor reflex. Concomitantly, the small decrease in SV suggests stiffness of the veins and/or active venoconstriction which may help to prevent a bigger fall in blood pressure.\r"

Mean blood pressure (MBP) increased slightly but significantly from 78.8 +/- 13.2 to 88.9 +/- 16.9 mmHg. Hemodynamically, total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) increased significantly from 1,444 +/- 367 to 2,146 +/- 470 dynes.sec.cm-5.m2, while cardiac index (CI) decreased significantly from 4.49 +/- 0.85 to 3.37 +/- 0.60 l/min/m2. Both pulse rate (PR) and stroke volume index (SVI) also decreased significantly, but blood volume (BV) remained unchanged. Plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine decreased significantly. There were positive correlations between the change of MBP and that of CI, and between the change in CI and that of BV, respectively (p less than 0.05 or less). In conclusion the improvement of anemia using rHuEPO is hemodynamically associated with an increase in TPRI and a decrease in CI as well. Blood pressure elevation seems to be caused by an inappropriately minor reduction of CI. The contribution of humoral factors is not suggested.\r"

The 61 study subjects (37% of charts reviewed) had growth records for ages 7 years and less and were without developmental delay syndromes. Thirty-nine (64%) of 61, were girls; ages at presentation were 1 to 14 years. Data collection included previous and presenting weights, heights, medical problems, and evidence of parental and sibling obesity. Study subjects' mean percent of ideal body weight for height (% IBWH) at presentation was 160 percent. Many study subjects had medical problems considered to be related to obesity: 30 percent had asthma, 25 percent elevated blood pressure, and 28 percent hyperlipidemia. Thirty (63%) of 48, study subjects with data on maternal weight and height, had obese mothers and 14 (31%) of 45 had obese fathers. Fourteen (50%) of 28 had one or more obese siblings. Among all study subjects, the proportion of obese (% IBWH greater than 120%) and severely obese children (% IBWH greater than 140%) increased between ages 1 and 7 years. For example, the proportion greater than 140% IBWH was zero percent at 1 year and 3 years; 0.1 at 2 years; 0.2 at 4 years; 0.5 at 5 to 6 years; and 0.6 at 7 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Statistical analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between full scale IQ (FSIQ) and HC (p less than 0.005). The incidence of specific learning disabilities based on significant academic and achievement discrepancies was 54% in those with HC greater than 2 S.D., 39% for normocephalic, and 23% for those with HC less than 2 S.D. Comparison of HC with results from the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) demonstrated a tendency for those children with HC greater than 2 S.D. to have lower arithmetic scores when compared to results of children with normocephaly. Scores for spelling and reading ability did not demonstrate this tendency. The results of this study were found to be somewhat incongruous to those of previous studies of similar children. Further studies using large unselected populations are needed to better define the risks to learning that may be related to the extremes of head circumference.\r"

The authors discuss a pediatric patient with cardiac hydatid cyst in the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The cyst was diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography and by serology. A 3 month course of mebendazole therapy was only partially effective. The patient remains asymptomatic 2 years after diagnosis. HYDATID DISEASE is endemic in the Middle East. In a study from a surgical hospital in eastern Libya, the disease accounted for 0.89 percent of all hospital admissions. The echinococcus cyst grows very slowly and unless located in a critical anatomic site, it takes many years to evolve. Consequently, presentation in pediatric patients is distinctly uncommon. In an epidemiologic study from Benghazi, only 11.7 percent of patients were under 10 years old. Cardiac hydatid disease is rare at any age, accounting for less than 2 percent of all hydatid disease. Since the introduction of two-dimensional echocardiography, more cases are being diagnosed. All the reports in the recent literature are in adult patients. We report here, however, a cardiac hydatid cyst in the left ventricular wall in a child.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of four weeks of treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP, 500 micrograms twice daily) on the bronchial responsiveness to propranolol was examined in 16 patients with mild asthma in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Propranolol was inhaled in doubling concentrations and the results were expressed as the cumulative dose producing a 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PC20). After four weeks of treatment with BDP, the mean FEV1 increased from 82.0 percent predicted to 88.1 percent predicted. The difference was significant (p less than 0.001). Treatment with BDP did not significantly change the responsiveness to propranolol, the geometric mean PC20 being 3.17 mg/ml before and 3.64 mg/ml after BDP treatment. The recovery of FEV1 was faster after 60 minutes of BDP treatment in comparison with placebo treatment (beyond 90 minutes). This study suggests that BDP treatment is unable to reduce bronchial responsiveness to propranolol but can accelerate the recovery of bronchoconstriction induced by propranolol in asthmatic patients.\r"

Over 90 percent of patients had malignant tumors. The fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB group) was used exclusively during the first two years (61 cases, 32 patients). All except four of these cases utilized conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Subsequent to this, the rigid bronchoscope (RB group) was used as the primary instrument under general anesthesia (51 cases, 42 patients). Twelve cases combined both bronchoscopic modalities (combined group, 12 patients). The percentage improvement in proximal airway lumen diameter post-Nd:YAG laser therapy was significantly greater using the RB (p less than 0.05). For distal lesions, the FOB was superior (p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the complication or survival rates between the groups. Our data suggest that whenever possible, the RB should be used to treat proximal lesions, and the FOB should be used for distal lesions. Both bronchoscopes are often used together. Hence, laser bronchoscopists should be proficient in both bronchoscopic techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is one of the major clinical features of bronchial asthma. We previously reported that oral administration of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046, reduced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine in asthmatic subjects. In this study, the effect of aerosol administration of OKY-046 on bronchial hyperresponsiveness was evaluated in ten inpatients with intrinsic asthma. Acetylcholine inhalation tests were performed before and after four days of inhalation of OKY-046 (100 mg/day). The provocative concentration of acetylcholine producing a 20 percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20-FEV1) and that causing a 35 percent fall in respiratory conductance (PC35-Grs) were measured as indexes of bronchial responsiveness. There was a significant increase in PC20-FEV1 (p less than 0.001) and PC35-Grs (p less than 0.02) after inhalation of OKY-046 from 0.79 (GSEM, 1.41) Mg/ml and 0.96 (GSEM, 1.35) mg/ml to 1.20 (GSEM, 1.41) mg/ml and 1.74 (GSEM, 1.32) mg/ml, respectively. There was no significant difference in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, or respiratory resistance (Rrs) baseline values before and after inhalation of OKY-046. Platelet aggregation was not inhibited by the treatment in other five inpatients. Thus, prophylactic administration of aerosol OKY-046 may be available for treatment of asthma by reduction of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum dose.\r"

Patients without pulmonary artery hypertension at rest (mean pulmonary artery pressure less than 20 mm Hg) underwent an exercise test which identified a group with PAH during exercise (MPAP greater than 30 mm Hg). The patients were divided into four groups: group 1, or control group: 17 healthy nonsmokers without normal respiratory function data; group 2: COPD without PAH (n = 12); group 3: PAH during exercise (n = 26); group 4: PAH at rest (n = 22). Analysis of Doppler data included time to peak velocity, right ventricular pre-ejection period, and ejection period. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was a simple and reliable method of detecting PAH. Latent PAH, revealed by the exercise test, was accompanied by significant changes in Doppler findings, confirming the sensitivity of the method.\r"

Overall, PABF was measured in 55 patients (93.2 percent). The LOSV gave consistently higher values of PVF than those obtained either by ROSV (p less than 0.05) or by SAPV (p less than 0.05). We conclude that LOSV and ROSV allow measurement of PABF in the majority of patients with COPD.\r"

After PTMC, dramatic improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics were seen in all patients. With regard to pulmonary function data, the VC as percent predicted value increased from 87.6 +/- 16.1 percent to 94.7 +/- 14.4 percent (p less than 0.001). Although the ratio of FEV1/FVC was unchanged, the MVV as percent predicted value increased, and the ratio of RV/TLC, CV, and the difference in nitrogen concentration between 750 ml and 1,250 ml of expired volume decreased significantly. According to the maximum expiratory flow-volume curves, V ax 50% and Vmax 25% improved. Despite marked improvements in pulmonary ventilatory function soon after PTMC, the percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide decreased significantly after PTMC. Arterial blood gas data, such as the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in arterial blood and the alveolar-arterial differences in partial pressure of oxygen, did not improve within one or two weeks after PTMC. We conclude that in mitral stenosis, the majority of ventilatory function impairments are caused by hemodynamic alterations that are mainly reversible.\r"

Eighteen normal subjects between the ages of 33 and 47 breathed under two conditions: normal controlled breathing and breathing against an inspiratory resistance at 60 percent of their maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). The PM, RR, duty cycle (TI/TTOT, and VT were held constant. During resistance breathing, VAS dyspnea was increased when EMG-DI decreased; EMG-SM increased in association with the sensation of dyspnea. During inspiratory resistance breathing, dyspnea markedly increased and rib cage and accessory muscle recruitment was the predominant pattern of breathing. These data suggest that dyspnea may be associated with the recruitment of the accessory respiratory muscles rather than the recruitment of the diaphragm.\r"

Data were derived from two cohorts followed longitudinally over a 9-11 year period. All variables were adjusted for age, sex and height by expressing them as Z-scores. In all smoking groups and in both cohorts, the tracking index was highest for FEV1, indicating that this variable was the most reproducible over the period of follow-up; delta N2/L and FEV1/FVC had very similar but slightly lower tracking indices; CV/VC consistently had the lowest tracking indices. Tracking indices were generally higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. The reproducibility of CC/TLC increased over the period of follow-up whereas the FEV1 reproducibility remained constant. We found no significant difference between those with high tracking indices and those with low indices in terms of sex, smoking status, prevalence of respiratory symptoms, history of respiratory disease, and rate of decline of FEV1. We conclude that FEV1 is the most reproducible of the variables examined, both within and between individuals, and that poor tracking or reproducibility are not related to smoking or to the presence of respiratory symptoms or disease.\r"

After left SLT the left posttx VCR was correlated with the left predicted VCD (r = 0.83; p less than 0.05); however, no correlation was found between these after DLT. In contrast, there was a tendency toward correlation between the posttx VCR and the predicted VCR after DLT (r = 0.75; p less than 0.1), but no such trend was apparent after SLT. These results suggest that posttx VCR depends primarily on predicted VCD after SLT and on pred VCR after DLT. Therefore, in donor-recipient size matching for lung transplantation a donor with a pred VCD greater than the pred VCR should be chosen for a left SLT recipient, whereas a donor with a pred VCD near the pred VCR would be suitable for a DLT recipient.\r"

In Arkansas, a simple colorimetric method of checking the urine for isoniazid (the Potts-Cozart test) has been used for many years, but it is relatively unknown outside that state and its reliability has not been confirmed. To evaluate this test, urine was blindly tested from patients from a tuberculosis clinic. Controls included urine from patients from a substance abuse clinic and Veterans Medical Center. In more than 200 urine samples tested, no false-positives were found. Urinalysis showed normal values for three patients who were supposed to be receiving antituberculosis medication, but it is likely that these patients were noncompliant. A peculiarity of the test was that the color change with positive tests varied. To investigate this variation, absorption spectroscopy of many substances was performed. Nicotine accounted for the different shade of blue associated with the positive test, but the color produced and the absorption spectroscopy were different from isoniazid, so it did not confuse the interpretation of the results. This test for isoniazid in the urine is simple, quick, inexpensive, easy to interpret, and reliable. It also can be used to detect nicotine and its metabolites.\r"

Twenty controls were recruited for CT. The chest roentgenograms were normal in the two groups. The results indicated the presence of various types of emphysematous lesions (EL) in the ISP group located predominantly in the apical fields with subpleural location in 16 patients. Interestingly, diffuse but moderate centrilobular emphysema was noted in 12 of 20 patients. The EL visual quantification was always less than 5 percent of the CT slices' total areas. The lung mean density shifted significantly toward the air density in the patient group (patients: -743 +/- 57.5 HU vs controls -713 +/- 59.5 HU, p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that CT may be useful for early assessment of EL in patients with ISP.\r"

Three men and one woman were examined at our institution for pleural effusion between 21 and 50 days after a minor thoracic trauma. At their initial examination, the pleural fluid analysis showed, for each subject, a high eosinophilic count (54, 45, 25, and 45 percent, respectively). Blood analysis taken at that time revealed a concomitant increase in the number of peripheral eosinophils (1,078, 3,894, 900, and 2,128 eosinophils per cubic millimeter, respectively). For each subject, there was no evidence of past or current allergy or of systemic disease that could be associated with hypereosinophilia. We observed a parallel regression of the pleural effusion and of the number of blood eosinophils in each case. Only when the pleural effusion completely cleared did the blood eosinophilia return to normal. We conclude that posttraumatic pleural effusion may cause a striking blood eosinophilia and that a persistently elevated number of blood eosinophils suggests the nonresolution of the pleural effusion.\r"

Seven patients had evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Only three patients had normal aerobic capacity; VO2 max in the other 8 patients was 46 +/- 8 percent of predicted when they stopped exercising. Four patients had a normal O2 pulse; seven patients had a reduced O2 pulse while five of seven patients exceeded 85 percent of their target heart rate. We conclude that while asymptomatic impairments in pulmonary function are uncommon in polymyositis, the incidence of pulmonary hypertension is high, but symptoms may be masked by the peripheral muscle weakness.\r"

The apparatus (Oscillaire) was connected with a spirometer forming a closed respiratory circuit in which gas concentrations were kept constant. Measurements were made in 15 healthy subjects (group 1) and in 30 asthmatic patients with bronchial hyperreactivity, subdivided into group 2 treated only with inhaled beta 2-mimetics (n = 15) and in group 3 using both beta 2-mimetics and steroids in inhalation (n = 15). No significant differences were found between the impedance data obtained with the Oscillaire alone and those obtained with the Oscillaire connected with the spirometer circuit. The impedance was measured at FRC level, and at FRC +1 L and -1 L. The relative changes of the resistance at 8 Hz were -23.2 percent (13.8) at FRC +1 L and +40.9 percent (29.3) at FRC -1 L relative to the values at resting FRC. This inverse relation between airway resistance and lung volume was similar in all groups. The average reactance decreased at FRC -1 L in all groups. However, at FRC +1 L the average reactance increased 50.6 percent in group 2 and 94.2 percent in group 3, but decreased in group 1. Concomitant changes were observed in the resonant frequency and in the frequency dependence of resistance. Because of these qualitatively different responses of the impedance data to changes in lung volume (both for the whole group and for each individual) between healthy subjects and asthmatic patients, this test might be useful for the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity.\r"

The flow parameters that are reported include in vivo and in vitro mean pressure drop, cardiac output or cardiac index, regurgitant volume, effective orifice area, and performance index. These data provide a framework for differentiation of normal and abnormal bioprosthetic valve function.\r"

However, tachyphylaxis has been argued to occur because of beta 2-adrenoceptor down-regulation following therapy with beta 2-adrenergic agents. To investigate receptor alterations, human peripheral mononuclear leukocytes are frequently used, since human lung tissue is not easily available. In order to study whether beta 2-adrenoceptors in MNL reliably reflect the conditions in the human lung tissue, we compared MNL and human lung tissue of 18 patients who had to undergo lung resection. Ten patients were untreated, and eight had bronchodilator therapy prior to therapy with terbutaline because of bronchoconstriction. Both in human lung and MNL, the beta 2-adrenoceptor subpopulation was characterized by competition experiments with the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 207.12 A and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118.551. In MNL, a significant decrease in the density of beta 2-adrenoceptors was found in treated but not in untreated patients, while the antagonist affinity of the beta 2-adrenoceptors remained unchanged. However, in lung parenchyma, which was obtained at the very same time from the same patients, no down-regulation of the total amount of beta 2-adrenoceptors could be measured. It is concluded that MNLs are a reliable model for studying properties of beta 2-adrenoceptor regulation. However, the hereby obtained results show that MNLs do not reflect the conditions of beta 2-adrenoceptors in human lung tissue. Human lung tissue is found to be less susceptible than human MNL for beta 2-adrenoceptor down-regulation by terbutaline treatment at therapeutic doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To estimate the exposure of a health care worker, we measured the ambient concentration of aerosolized pentamidine in field conditions in 36 m3 unventilated treatment room. The amount of pentamidine averaged in three different environmental air samples over a four-hour period was 4.5 +/- 3.6 x 10(-5) mg/m3. This amount is very small compared to the doses received by the patients in whom long-term adverse effects are few. The greater risk to health care workers is probably transmission of tuberculosis from undiagnosed cases, especially in populations with an increased incidence of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis control measures such as improved ventilation and masks should also decrease exposure to ambient air pentamidine until toxicity studies determine long-term adverse effects, if any, of aerosolized pentamidine.\r"

This study examined the relationship between intrauterine growth and serial gestational spirometry in 352 pregnant asthmatic women who were prospectively treated and observed during pregnancy. A small (r = 0.11) but significant (p less than 0.04) direct correlation was demonstrated between infant birth weight and individual mean percent predicted FEV1 during pregnancy. In addition, lower maternal mean FEV1 during pregnancy was associated with increased incidences of birth weight in the lower quartile of the infant population (p = 0.002) and ponderal indices less than 2.2 (suggestive of asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation) (p less than 0.05), but not with increased incidences of preterm (less than 38 weeks) or low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants. Although lower mean birth weight occurred in infants of smoking compared with nonsmoking asthmatic mothers (p less than 0.02), the relationships of lower FEV1 to birth weight in the lower quartile of the population (odds ratio 3.0, p = 0.002) and ponderal indices less than 2.2 (odds ratio 2.8, p less than 0.05) were shown by multivariate analysis to be above and beyond the influence of smoking and also independent of the effects of age, parity, acute asthmatic episodes, and asthma medications. These data support the hypothesis that lower maternal gestational FEV1 during pregnancy is related to intrauterine growth retardation and suggest that the goals of gestational asthma therapy should include optimization of pulmonary function in addition to achievement of symptomatic control.\r"

To demonstrate that our original observations are generalizable to other facilities that process eggs, and to estimate the prevalence of IgE-mediated occupational asthma among egg-exposed workers, we conducted surveys at two additional plants. We administered a questionnaire to 188 employees to identify workers with symptoms suggestive of occupational asthma. We further evaluated 88 workers with and without symptoms by a clinical examination by a physician blinded to results of other tests, serial peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) determinations every three hours while awake for one week, and skin prick tests and serum specific IgE levels to extracts of factory egg products, commercial egg test reagents, and egg white protein fractions. Fourteen workers had work-related asthmalike symptoms by questionnaire, a physician diagnosis of occupational asthma, and evidence of IgE-mediated sensitization to one or more egg proteins. Workers exposed exclusively to liquid egg aerosol, as well as workers exposed primarily to dried airborne egg protein, developed occupational asthma. This study replicated our original observations and demonstrated that workers in all areas of liquid and powdered egg production are at risk of developing occupational asthma from exposure to airborne egg proteins.\r"

In ten patients, cVO2 and DO2 were significantly correlated, but in only two of these patients mVO2 also correlated with DO2. In two patients, there was a significant correlation between mVO2 and DO2. The main contribution to the correlation and to the slope of the regression line between cVO2 and DO2 may be due to mathematic coupling of cVO2 and DO2. With cVO2, erroneous conclusions concerning the VO2-DO2 relationship may be drawn. In four patients, DO2 and mVO2 were significantly related, reflecting either physiologic coupling or pathologic supply dependency of VO2.\r"

The accuracy of this new method was tested by comparison with standard analog recorder methods using a mechanical lung model, in ventilated patients in an intensive care unit, and in normal volunteers. In all settings, excellent correlation was obtained between P0.1 measurements by the digital Servo and standard analog methods (r = 0.99). This new method permits accurate and automatic determination of P0.1 in ventilated patients using standard respiratory equipment. The rapid response and ease of use of this method should enable evaluation of a number of physiologic variables involved in respiratory control in ventilated and nonventilated patients.\r"

Instruments for hemodynamic and respiratory measurements were placed in ten spontaneously breathing, anesthetized sheep. In each animal, baseline measurements were made during PS and flow-cycled AMV. Acute lung injury was then instituted by instilling hydrochloric acid in the endotracheal tube, and after 60 minutes, measurements were repeated. No hemodynamic or respiratory variables differed, either before or after ALI, between PS and AMV. This study demonstrates that PS, when used as a stand-alone mode of ventilation, has similar hemodynamic and respiratory effects as flow-cycled AMV.\r"

This case emphasizes that the potential for life-threatening cardiovascular events from IA exists in patients without previously defined cardiac risk factors.\r"

We report the findings in a patient with renal failure who experienced alopecia and significant mucositis following sclerotherapy. We suspect this systemic toxicity resulted from intrapleural bleomycin and suggest that this treatment be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction.\r"

A review of the medical records, autopsy reports, and in-depth discussion with local physicians and well-informed family members was performed. It was impossible, even after the review, to ascertain the exact cause of death in 22 patients. In the remaining patients, the cause of death was as follows: metastatic colorectal carcinoma, 64 patients (58.2 percent), (colon, 49 [44.5 percent], rectal, 15 [13.6 percent]); desmoid tumors, 12 (10.9 percent); periampullary carcinoma, 9 (8.2 percent); brain tumors, 8 (7.3 percent); perioperative mortalities, 5 (4.5 percent); adrenal carcinoma, 1 (0.9 percent); and abdominal carcinomatosis, 1 (0.9 percent). Ten patients died of causes not related to FAP. The major causes of death in 36 patients who underwent prophylactic colectomy were desmoid tumor and periampullary malignancy. This finding underscores the importance of lifelong surveillance and periodic endoscopic evaluation in patients with FAP.\r"

Four patients (7.4 percent) underwent emergency resection for gangrene with a mortality of 75 percent. Of the 50 patients who presented without ischemia, 23 (46 percent) were managed by nonoperative detorsion while 3 (6 percent) detorsed spontaneously. Fourteen of these 26 patients received no further treatment. Nonoperative mortality was 0 percent. Celiotomy was performed on 36 patients. The type of operative procedure performed had no significant bearing on outcome. Fifteen patients underwent resection and anastomosis; two of these patients died (13 percent). Fifteen patients underwent resection and colostomy with two deaths (13 percent), and six had open detorsion alone with one death (17 percent). The two factors associated with adverse outcome after surgical intervention were patient age and history of previous volvulus. All five deaths occurred in patients older than 70 years presenting with a first episode of volvulus (N = 15, mortality = 33 percent). No deaths occurred among patients younger than 70 years regardless of volvulus history or among those older than 70 years who were being treated for a recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.01). Patients older than 70 years with a first episode of volvulus represent a high risk if subjected to surgical intervention. Nonoperative detorsion alone should be considered for this subgroup of patients.\r"

To clarify retinal pigmentation as an important subclinical marker in patients with FAP, precise retinal examinations were performed in 41 cases (82 eyes), including 23 patients and 18 family members including 12 second-generation and third-generation possible carriers. In 27 patients, precise studies were done on accompanying lesions, and the number of polyps was counted at the time of surgery in each patient in every family tree. The overall incidence of retinal pigmentation in patients was 82.6 percent. The incidence of retinal pigmentation in possible carriers was found to be 50 percent, which is comparable with the calculated expressibility of the polyps. The shape and distribution of pigmentations were classified into two categories--large and small. A total of 1984 control retinal examinations were performed, which revealed only six retinal pigmentations (0.3 percent). In the control group, all pigmentation was solitary and unilateral. No large pigmentations in bilateral eyes were found in the control group. In large pigmentation, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 0.652 and 0.999, respectively, and in small pigmentation, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 0.783 and 0.997, respectively. Small pigmentation appears to increase in number around the age of the appearance of the polyp. Earliest recognition of the pigmentation in this series was one year of age.\r"

The muscular anatomy of the pelvic floor is generally understood, but the neuroanatomy remains controversial. The authors dissected three male cadavers and traced the sacral nerves from their entrance into the pelvis through the sacral foramina throughout their branching to their final destinations. Deriving from a common source, the sacral nerves S2 to S4, the neural supply of the levator ani was distinct from that of the external anal sphincter: the levator is supplied by direct branches splitting from the sacral nerves proximal to the sacral plexus and running on the inner surface; the external anal sphincter is supplied by nerve fibres travelling with the pudendal nerve on the levator's undersurface. To document the functional relevance of these anatomic findings, stimulation of the pudendal and sacral nerves was performed at different levels in five patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Stimulation of the pudendal nerve increased the anal pressure, whereas stimulation of S3 increased it only slightly but caused an impressive decrease of the rectoanal angle; when S3 was stimulated after bilateral pudendal block, anal pressure did not change but the decrease in the rectoanal angulation persisted. The changes in anal pressure could be obtained without fatigue at stimulation frequencies of 10 to 20 Hz.\r"

Further statistical analysis identified four subgroups of patients showing different pathomechanisms of fecal incontinence: severe combined anorectal motor and sensory dysfunction, isolated anal sphincter dysfunction, isolated anorectal sensory dysfunction, and combined dysfunction of the internal anal sphincter and impaired anorectal sensitivity. These data support the hypothesis that sensory function of both the rectum and the anal canal is an important and independent factor in the preservation of continence.\r"

No significant changes in any metabolic parameter were found in the 24-hour group. In the 48-hour group, there was a significant decrease in serum sodium (P less than 0.005), serum chloride (P less than 0.005), pH (P less than 0.005), HCO3 (P less than 0.005), and base excess (P less than 0.005). Only 16 of 35 cases (46 percent) had an acceptable bowel preparation: 11 of 17 (65 percent) in the 24-hour group and 5 of 18 (28 percent) in the 48-hour group. Marker studies did not correlate with the quality of bowel preparation. The risk of potentially explosive intraluminal gas was increased if the bowel preparation was poor: 12 of 19 patients (63 percent) with a poor bowel preparation compared with 3 of 16 patients (19 percent) of those with an acceptable preparation (P less than 0.005). Picolax is a poor mechanical bowel preparation and is associated with unacceptable physiologic disturbance if given two days before surgery.\r"

Those undergoing transvaginal repair had a much greater problem with pain. Our relatively poor results may be due to an unselective approach to rectocele repair. The presence of both constipation and a rectocele does not imply an association, and a complete anorectal physiologic examination should precede repair. There is no functional difference between transvaginal and transanal rectocele repair.\r"

  ".W": "The management of patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma is controversial. While a \"no treatment\" attitude still persists, other patients undergo systemic chemotherapy with very limited results. Other possible options are hepatic resection and locoregional treatments. One hundred twenty-three patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer were treated at the authors' institution over a period of 15 years. Thirty-nine patients underwent hepatic resection while 84 underwent various forms of locoregional treatment. Several patients in the latter group were registered in one national (RNSI) Phase 2 study and one international (EORTC) Phase 3 trial. The authors' experience confirms the opinion that hepatic resection can be performed with the aim of curing in patients with isolated metastases. A five-year survival rate can be achieved in 25 to 30 percent of the resectable patients. Patients with unresectable extrahepatic disease or multiple bilateral metastases are usually excluded from resection. In other cases, hepatic resection should be carried out when technically possible. The value of adjuvant chemotherapy to the remaining liver has to be tested in prospective randomized trials. Patients with diffuse metastases can benefit from locoregional infusion of chemotherapeutic agents. Symptoms improve in most patients; objective responses vary from 53 to 83 percent of the cases, which is a higher rate than that reported for systemic chemotherapy. Survival may be prolonged in respect to untreated patients but this has not been demonstrated yet by prospective randomized studies. Current trends are continuous infusion of chemotherapeutic agents and experimentation of new drugs or drug combinations. Future improvements may be achieved by adding hepatic arterial ischemia, hyperthermia, or radiation therapy. As these kinds of treatments are still experimental, they should be applied to the patients only in the context of prospective clinical trials.\r"

No relevant quantitative variations of gut endocrine cells were detected, as revealed by immunostaining for the general marker, chromogranin, compared with normal ileal mucosa. Immunostaining for different peptide-containing cells resulted in normal number and morphology of serotonin, enteroglucagon, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, and somatostatin-containing cells. Neurotensin cells were less numerous than in normal mucosa. The role played by gastrointestinal hormones in the adaptive response of the intestine to pouch construction is, presently, unclear.

Twenty-two severely constipated patients who did not improve after a high fiber diet were submitted to whole gut transit time (TT), proctographic, and anorectal manometric studies. A control group consisting of five subjects for TT, five subjects for proctogram, and ten subjects for manometry was also studied. Transit time was delayed (P less than 0.001) in all patients. Manometry in the constipated group showed a high rectal threshold (64.1 vs. 17.1 ml of air, P less than 0.01), but no other significant difference. Proctograms in 10 of 22 patients (Group A) showed no differences in the anorectal angle (ARA) and in its distance from the pubococcygeal line (DLPC) in respect to the control group; 12 of 22 patients (Group B) had a paradoxical closure of the ARA at straining in respect to resting position (101.2 degrees vs. 120.1 degrees), and a higher DLPC than Group A and the control group in all positions studied. There was no difference in TT for rectal stasis of radiopaque markers between the two pathologic groups. Patients in Group B were older than patients in Group A (55.3 vs. 42.9 years, P less than 0.05). In conclusion, proctograms showed alterations of the pelvic floor, but there was no correlation between protographic data and rectal or colonic stasis of the radiopaque markers, or clinic severity of constipation, but a correlation between ages did exist.\r"

All patients in the study had infectious disease and were at risk for the development of sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis was diagnosed in 34 patients, 24 of whom died (six within the first 24 hours). The 26 patients who did not evolve toward sepsis served as a control group. The clinical condition of all patients was monitored by daily APACHE II scoring. Blood was drawn once a day and additional samples were taken in patients whose clinical condition underwent sudden deterioration. TNF-alpha levels were measured with a commercially available immunoradiometric assay. At time of patient admission, TNF-alpha levels were higher in the group with sepsis than in the control group (median 79 iqr 329 vs median 0.5 iqr 5; p less than 0.001). In the group with sepsis, extremely high TNF-alpha levels were found in patients who died within 24 hours. These patients had TNF-alpha levels of 917 iqr 755 pg/ml, whereas the patients who died more than 24 hours after admission had TNF-alpha levels of 58 iqr 59 pg/ml. Survivors had lower TNF-alpha levels (26 iqr 347 pg/ml). APACHE II scores correlated with TNF-alpha levels in the total sepsis group (Spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.477; p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thiamine, 50 nmol/L, crossed from the maternal to fetal compartment at a rate somewhat below that of antipyrine, a freely diffusible marker drug. The transport was saturable and inhibited by structural analogues of thiamine, implying participation of carriers. Thiamine accumulated in the fetal compartment against a concentration gradient, suggesting active transport. Consistent with this, transfer of thiamine from the fetal to maternal compartment was significantly lower than in the opposite direction. The vitamin was concentrated in the placenta when compared with maternal and fetal levels. There was no evidence of phosphorylation of thiamine during its transfer. Exposure of the placenta to ethanol, 400 mg/dl, for up to 4 hours did not alter maternal-to-fetal transfer of the vitamin.\r"

Two-day-old mice were infected intraperitoneally with 10(4) TCID50 coxsackievirus B4 and then randomized to receive indomethacin or saline for 7 days. A number of them were killed on designated days. Mortality, viral titers, antibody, and interferon levels plus histopathologic changes in the heart were compared. Among treated animals, mortality was greater (22/45 vs 7/27; p = 0.07) and viral titers were higher on days 4 and 7 (p = 0.038 and 0.028, respectively). Interferon levels were lower on days 4 and 7 (p = 0.028 and 0.008, respectively), and histopathologic changes were more extensive on days 7 and 21 (p = 0.008 and 0.028, respectively). These findings show that indomethacin decreased interferon production, increased coxsackievirus4 titers, and enhanced the virulence of coxsackievirus B4. These results raise significant concerns about the safety of indiscriminate use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents during severe viral infections.\r"

We designed this study to explore the immunoregulatory role of PS in vivo. Guinea pigs were immunized to complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and 2 weeks later were subjected to an aerosol challenge with purified protein derivative (PPD) to induce immune lung injury (group I). Group II and group III were subjected to lung lavage by tracheostomy just before aerosol challenge. Group II was lavaged with 0.9% NaCl, which depleted PS by 32%. Group III was lavaged with 0.9% NaCl containing bovine surfactant, which did not alter total PS content. Control animals for each condition were not presensitized to CFA. All guinea pigs were killed 24 hours after the aerosol challenge; for each group n = 10 +/- 2. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein and mononuclear leukocyte counts, as well as lung histopathologic grading, were performed. Group I animals showed evidence of mild immune lung injury by these parameters. Animals partially depleted of PS (group II) showed more severe lung injury with greater abnormalities in BAL leukocytes and histopathology compared with group I. Guinea pigs lavaged with fluid containing bovine surfactant (group III) were nearly identical to group I with respect to these two parameters. BAL protein levels were not related to PS depletion. This study suggests that surfactant may have an in vivo role in modulating the inflammatory response that accompanies immune lung injury in this model.\r"

After administration of intravenous bolus doses of HO-Cbl and CN-Cbl (5, 10, 25 mg/kg) to female foxhounds, peak plasma concentrations were attained within 1 minute, after which the cobalamins disappeared from plasma in a manner consistent with two-phase distribution and elimination kinetics. While mean t1/2 measurements for the initial distribution phase were similar for HO-Cbl and CN-Cbl, the secondary excretion phase was more prolonged for HO-Cbl than for CN-Cbl (t1/2, 94.75 minutes vs 62.64 minutes, respectively). Pharmacokinetic data permitted the design of a HO-Cbl infusion schedule that resulted in stable plasma concentrations in test animals. When NaCN was then given intravenously to animals preloaded with HO-Cbl (20 micrograms/ml plasma), conversion of HO-Cbl to CN-Cbl in vivo, was documented by both thin-layer and high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of successive urine samples. Moreover, in dogs preloaded with HO-Cbl (20 micrograms/ml plasma), up to 10% of the cyanide administered as NaCN infusions was recovered in urine as CN-Cbl by 60 minutes, compared with less than 0.3% in dogs not treated with HO-Cbl. In addition, under these conditions of HO-Cbl loading, the minimum doses of NaCN required to produce sublethal signs of cyanide toxicity (hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia) were found to be increased to levels that in some cases exceeded normally lethal doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report a sensitive method to measure 5-ASA and its known major metabolite acetyl 5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) directly from the serum without any extraction procedure. Using front-face fluorometry, 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA were detected at the excitation wavelength of 310 nm with emission maxima at 475 nm and 440 nm, respectively. Standard curves were obtained by adding known amounts of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA to several individual and pooled human sera. Presence of sulfapyridine (0 to 20 micrograms/ml) and SASP (0 to 15 micrograms/ml) in the serum did not interfere with the assays. Five microliters of acetic anhydride was added to the serum to convert all 5-ASA to Ac-5-ASA. The difference in the spectrum before and after addition of acetic anhydride represented the concentration of free 5-ASA. The values thus estimated were within 1% of the expected readings from the standard curves. This assay was compared with the organic extraction method for the determination of free and acetylated 5-ASA in sera of patients given olsalazine (azodisalicylate). The results demonstrate that direct analysis of the sera by front-face fluorometry enables us to measure 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA at levels as low as 0.1 micrograms/ml in serum, making this method at least 10-fold more sensitive than the current available extraction methods.\r"

Because production rates (PRs) of 25(OH)D3 were not different between the two groups of rats (renal failure, 1.8 +/- 1.1; control, 1.8 +/- 0.42 microgram/kg/day), the decreased MCR resulted in elevation of plasma levels of 25(OH)D3 (22.7 +/- 1.6 vs control 17.1 +/- 0.28 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). Injection of 600 ng 25(OH)D3 per day for 6 days significantly increased the MCR of 25(OH)D3 in both normal rats (89.6 +/- 3.2 microliters/min/kg, n = 6, p less than 0.01) and rats with renal failure (84.9 +/- 9.7 microliters/min/kg, n = 6, p less than 0.01) when compared with normal rats (73.4 microliters/min/kg) and rats with renal failure (54.6 microliters/min/kg) injected with vehicle, respectively.

Future therapy with alpha 1PI with reactive site mutants of this inhibitor will probably require the use of recombinant-derived alpha 1PI (r alpha 1PI). However, the pharmacologic efficacy of r alpha 1PI in humans has been hindered, since r alpha 1PI is rapidly cleared from the circulation of experimental animals. Our studies of the metabolism of r alpha 1PI in mice demonstrate that the rapid clearance of r alpha 1PI is due to renal filtration. However, after preventing renal filtration by ligation of the renal arteries, we find that r alpha 1PI is metabolized in a manner similar to alpha 1PI. Conjugation of r alpha 1PI to polyethylene glycol of Mr approximately 4000 (PEG-4) greatly slows the clearance of r alpha 1PI. The PEG-4 r alpha 1PI conjugate is metabolized in a manner similar to alpha 1PI and has similar kinetic properties before and after oxidation with N-chlorosuccinimide. Moreover, proteinase complexes of PEG-4-r alpha 1PI are catabolized by the same hepatocyte receptor that binds alpha 1PI-proteinase complexes. The results of these studies lay the groundwork for the synthesis of pharmacologically effective r alpha 1PI derivatives with acceptable plasma retention times.\r"

  ".W": "Lipophilic drugs intended for intravenous use can be solubilized by mixed-micellar systems containing glycoholic acid and lecithin (MM). Our present studies determined the influence of such MM preparations on albumin binding of monoacetyldiaminodiphenyl sulfone (MADDS), a deputy ligand for bilirubin. After intravenous administration of MMs to healthy male and female adult volunteers, concentration-time profiles of bile acid and nonesterified (NEFA) and esterified fatty acids were obtained as well. In vitro experiments with blood from adults and from neonatal cords indicated a modest reduction in reserve albumin for binding of MADDS after addition of MMs, resulting from glycocholic acid in the micellar preparation. After injection of MM preparations with up to 530 mg glycocholic acid, a rapid decrease of the reserve albumin was observed. The effect was more pronounced in men than in women and resulted in different areas under the time curve for the decrease (p = 0.049). At their maximum (3 to 10 minutes after MM doses) the decreases averaged (+/- SD) 68% +/- 14% in men and 45% +/- 8.5% in women. Low reserve albumin concentrations were maintained over 20 minutes despite rapidly declining bile acid concentrations. Injection of MM caused a drastic increase of NEFA in the serum samples with a more pronounced effect in men (average +/- SD increase: 473% +/- 93%) than in women (148% +/- 91%) (p = 0.01). The changes in NEFA concentrations ran reciprocal to the changes of reserve albumin for binding MADDS. In all subjects the increase in NEFA was accompanied by a decrease in reserve albumin for palmitate. Fatty acid binding to albumin was well restored within 1 hour. Thus, before drugs incorporated in MM can be prescribed to neonates who are at risk for having kernicterus, the impact of intravenous MM on bilirubin binding and NEFA levels must be investigated in that patient population.\r"

  ".U": "90330897\r", 
  ".W": "Two of the major divalent cations in human physiology, Ca++ and Fe++, are poorly soluble at the pH of intestinal contents, and active \"uphill\" transport mechanisms exist for both ions in proximal small intestine. We have recently demonstrated significant binding of Ca++ to both premicellar and micellar bile salts and have postulated that high-affinity premicellar binding involves interposition of Ca++ between terminal carboxyl (COO-) and 7-OH or 12-OH groups of the steroid ring. The present studies were made to determine whether such binding extends to other divalent cations, and specifically to Fe++, which, like Ca++, has a hydrated diameter of 6 A. Equilibrium dialysis studies of sodium taurocholate were made at 25 degrees C with solutions containing 0.5 to 150 mmol/L taurocholate and 0.018 to 1.8 mmol/L iron 59-labeled FeSO4 at pH 3.0 to 6.3 and a total ionic strength of 0.15 mol/L. In control (saline dialysand) cells, [Fe++] was virtually equal in dialysands and dialysates within 5 hours. In sharp contrast, taurocholate-containing dialysands showed significantly higher counts than dialysates, indicating Fe++ binding to taurocholate, independent of pH and Fe concentration. After correction for taurocholate-induced Gibbs-Donnan effects across the membrane, the apparent taurocholate affinity constant (K'f) for Fe++ in micellar solutions (5 to 150 mmol/L) was essentially constant at about 3.1 (mol/L)-1, then increased dramatically below the critical micellar concentration to greater than 100 (mol/L)-1 at [taurocholate] = 0.5 mmol/L. The hyperbolic rise in K'f below the critical micellar concentration is similar to that which we have previously reported for Ca++, indicating significant high-affinity binding of Fe++ to premicellar taurocholate anions and low-affinity binding to micellar anions. It is postulated that Fe++ binding, particularly by premicellar bile salts, may play an important physiologic role in increasing iron solubility within the intestinal lumen, thus increasing iron absorption. The possible role of bile salts in increasing divalent cation solubility and absorption from the intestine is a new field of bile acid research.\r"

Since melanin absorbs preferentially the wavelengths around 300 nm and the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 is stimulated by the same wavelengths (290 to 320 nm, ultraviolet light B [UVB]), we investigated the effect of tanning on vitamin D3 formation. Vitamin D3 and 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) serum levels were measured during midwinter (untanned state) in seven healthy subjects. Blood was obtained immediately before whole body exposure to UVB in a phototherapy unit, and again 24 hours later. The study was repeated in the same subjects during midsummer (tanned state) using the same UVB dose. Serum vitamin D3 increased in the untanned state from 1.7 +/- 0.4 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) to 11 +/- 1.5 ng/ml following UVB (p less than 0.001). In the tanned state, basal serum vitamin D3 was significantly higher: 9.6 +/- 2.8 ng/ml (p less than 0.04 basal untanned versus basal tanned), and exhibited minimal rise after UVB to 14.3 +/- 4.1 ng/ml (p greater than 0.1 for tanned basal versus post UVB tanned). Tanning was also associated with significantly higher serum 25-OH-D levels: 22.5 +/- 2.9 ng/ml (untanned) versus 36.9 +/- 4.7 ng/ml (tanned) (p less than 0.02). Thus excessive solar exposure produces, besides erythema and tanning, the resetting of the vitamin D3 synthetic mechanism with blunting of the response to UVB.\r"

  ".W": "The PIA1 antibody produces several clinically distinct and severe thrombocytopenias. Investigations have demonstrated divergent effects on platelet function; prior reports demonstrated inhibition, while a conflicting publication showed platelet activation. We have resolved this conflict using anti-PIA1 IgG produced by a patient with posttransfusion purpura. Relatively low concentrations stimulated platelet aggregation and release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) whereas high concentrations inhibited platelet function, producing a thrombasthenia-like state. The number of molecules of platelet-associated IgG necessary to initiate aggregation and ATP release (2,086 +/- 556) or produce maximum aggregation (23,420 +/- 3,706) or complete inhibition (63,582 +/- 2654) were measured with a quantitative radiometric assay for bound anti-PIA1. Preincubation of platelets with high concentrations of PIA1 antibody inhibited platelet aggregation with 10 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate and blocked 125I-labeled fibrinogen platelet binding. Platelet activation with nonfibrinogen dependent agonist, 1 U/ml thrombin, was not inhibited by this high concentration of PIA1 IgG. In conclusion, anti-PIAI IgG produces (1) stimulation of platelet aggregation and ATP release that is initiated with 2000 molecules IgG per platelet and is associated with an increase of 125I-fibrinogen binding; (2) conversely, inhibition of platelet aggregation is observed with maximum antibody binding, 63,000 molecules IgG per platelet, and is mediated via a blockade of fibrinogen binding.\r"

Forty four tumours measured less than 20 mm in diameter in the cerebellopontine angle and surgery was undertaken with hearing preservation as a principle objective. In 26 cases, the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically and post-operative hearing at levels better than mean pure tone threshold of 50 dB or 50 per cent speech discrimination was recorded in 14 patients. The preservation of hearing represents a worthwhile surgical goal in selected patients with an acoustic neuroma without increasing the operative morbidity.\r"

The risks of developing these complications is relatively unknown but because of its mortality, intracranial abscess is the most relevant. A 10-year review of all otogenic intracranial absesses in Scotland was carried out. A 15 per cent allowance was made for missing records. The annual risk in an adult with active chronic otitis media of developing an abscess is about one in 10,000 but its development is three times more likely in males. This risk might appear low but the lifetime expectancy of an individual aged 30 years with active chronic otitis media developing an abscess is one in 200. However, as yet, there is no evidence that surgery reduces this risk. Unfortunately, because of the duration of follow-up needed and the size of the sample required, scientific evidence would be difficult to obtain. However, 5 per cent of abscesses currently occur in the immediate post-operative period following mastoid surgery.\r"

Thus there was a reversal in the phase relationship between inspiration and expiration as flow rate increased. It was also found that peak inspiratory flow rate correlated better with values for nasal resistance than did peak expiratory flow rate. Flow rate measured by rhinomanometry during quiet respiration was more sensitive to physiologically induced changes in nasal resistance than was peak flow rate. The findings are discussed with reference to previous work on the physiology of nasal airflow.\r"

The scans were assessed for the presence of anatomical variants in the middle meatus, said to contribute to meatal stenosis, and for signs of asymptomatic infection revealed by the presence of clouding or mucosal thickening in the sinuses. Of the anatomical variants, only concha bullosa (pneumatisation of the middle turbinate) was associated with a high incidence of infection in the sinuses (85 per cent). Evidence of asymptomatic sinus infection was as high as 39 per cent overall, the highest incidence occurring in the ethmoid cells (28 per cent). Isolated ethmoid clouding on CT was observed in 15 per cent and is likely to be found in as many as one in seven of the adult population in the UK. It is concluded that in the majority of patients clouding confined to a few ethmoid cells shown on CT is without clinical significance. The evidence from the control series did not support the concept that most sinus infection starts in the middle meatus. The presence of a large reservoir of quiescent or chronic sinus infection in the control group suggests that in most instances sinusitis derives from a recrudescence of this pre-existing infection.\r"

Over a five-year period, we have diagnosed bilateral choanal atresia in 30 neonates. Trans-nasal surgery was performed on 27 of them. All belonged to the Black race group. The incidence was 1:8,300 live births. There was a female predominance of 5:1. Four (13 per cent) had other associated anomalies. One was a twin. Various factors were analysed to determine the cause of the stenosis. These were: 1. Drilling compared with curettage of the bony atretic plate. 2. Stenting versus non-stenting. 3. Soft versus hard Portex tube stenting. 4. Variation of stenting period--six, eight and twelve weeks. 5. The use of prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotic for the whole of the stenting period. The conclusion derived from this study is that curettage of bony atresia, stenting with soft Portex tube for a period of six weeks and the use of broad spectrum antibiotic for the entire stenting period eliminates the problem of stenosis associated with the trans-nasal approach for the correction of bilateral choanal atresia.\r"

Patients meeting selected criteria for hyperreflexia demonstrated a 46% decrease in their reflex response. Those without initial hyperreflexia failed to demonstrate a significant decrease.\r"

No complication was encountered during or after the operation. The procedure is simple, easy and safe, with the operator in a relaxed and comfortable position even when the patient has acute flexion of the uterus. Our clinical results prove that the soft and rigid structure of the fiberscope offers advantages over rigid scopes or conventional fiberscopes with full-length soft, malleable parts.\r"

No adverse effects on fetal well-being were noted in the exercising group. However, those who exercised had significantly shorter first and second stages of labor (mean length, 7.55 and 1.33 hours, respectively; P less than .001) as compared to those who did not exercise (mean length, 14.46 and 2.47 hours, respectively; P less than .001). The exercising primiparas were also less likely to require oxytocin augmentation of labor and more likely to have spontaneous vaginal deliveries. The data suggest that there might be beneficial effects from nonendurance antepartum exercise regimens for women with normal pregnancies. Hence, the data have implications for the counsel given pregnant women about antenatal exercise and for future research on exercise during pregnancy.\r"

The records of 1,131 patients were reviewed to determine whether development of a pedigree before amniocentesis reveals conditions other than those for which the patient was referred often enough to justify the time spent in the process. The patients were referred for a variety of reasons, with increased maternal age the most common. A positive finding in the pedigree was any condition other than that for which the patient was referred and that required additional comments or testing. It was found that 72.15% of the pedigrees contained at least one other positive finding. Thus, construction of a pedigree before genetic amniocentesis is a valuable objective since it reveals, in the majority of cases, additional factors that may influence the current or future pregnancies or may provide information for other family members.\r"

In 1985, based on an evaluation of toxicological data, the Food and Drug Administration concluded that milk and meat from bST-supplemented cows was safe and wholesome. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of milk and meat from bST-supplemented cows in the commercial food supply. Its evaluation of the impact of bST supplementation on the long-term health of dairy cattle is near completion, and bST may be approved for commercial use in early 1991.\r"

Cases that occurred within 12 months of the first malignant neoplasm were excluded. Survival was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards modeling, with age, sex, and specific type of ANLL as covariates. The 6271 patients with de novo ANLL had an estimated 12-month survival of 30%, while the 107 patients with treatment-related ANLL (radiation therapy, 60; chemotherapy, 29; both, 18) had an estimated 12-month survival of 10%. This is not due to lingering effects of the first tumor since ANLL following solid tumors not treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy (118 cases) has similar survival (estimated 12-month survival, 36%) as de novo ANLL. We conclude that ANLL that occurs after chemotherapy or radiation therapy is biologically more aggressive and/or resistant to therapy than spontaneous ANLL. This provides a rationale for current studies on treatment-induced cellular changes and on more aggressive therapy for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The Defibrillator Working Group of the Food and Drug Administration reviewed data from the Medical Device Reporting System and a recent five-state survey, as well as information presented at two Food and Drug Administration-sponsored conferences. These data include 156 reports of defibrillator problems to the Emergency Care Research Institute Problem Reporting Network, 495 reports of device problems to the Medical Device Reporting System, 676 reports of \"defibrillator failure\" in the five-state survey, 594 inspections of in-service defibrillators, and site visits to 212 emergency care facilities. The Defibrillator Working Group concluded that the frequency of defibrillator failures during clinical use may be unacceptably high. While some failures are attributable to component malfunctions, evidence suggests that errors in operator use and errors in defibrillator care and maintenance account for a high proportion of defibrillator failures. Inadequate initial training and cursory continuing education increases the chances of operator errors at the moment when correct operation is needed most. Failure of operators to perform daily equipment checks leads to poor familiarity with the equipment and failure to identify component failures or damaged devices. Many defibrillators and batteries are kept in service beyond an expected useful life, given their level of clinical use. In smaller hospitals and emergency medical services systems periodic maintenance responsibilities are not always appropriately delegated between qualified engineering personnel and defibrillator operators, and some systems completely lack services from clinical engineers. The objectives of the Defibrillator Working Group are to make personnel who use defibrillators more aware of the potential for errors in operator performance and in periodic maintenance and to recommend improvements in training, maintenance, and defibrillator design. This article presents the initial observations and recommendations of the working group.\r"

A recent study of hospitalizations for diarrhea in the United States suggested that the annual rotavirus epidemic may follow a regional sequence from west to east. As part of a program to establish active surveillance of rotavirus prior to the introduction of vaccines, we obtained 5 years of retrospective data on rotavirus detections from 88 centers throughout North America. Analysis of 34,644 detections indicates that the peak of the annual rotavirus epidemic occurs first in Mexico and the Southwest of the United States in late fall, goes systematically across the continent in the winter, and ends in the Northeast United States and the Maritime Provinces of Canada in the spring. When detections are grouped by region, onset of the epidemic follows the same regional sequence as the peak. To our knowledge, this is the only description of a repetitive geographic sequence for the seasonal epidemic activity of a viral agent. Further studies are indicated to determine whether climate, features of the virus itself, or other factors are responsible for this apparently unique pattern. A system of active surveillance can use this pattern to detect natural alterations in the epidemic behavior of rotavirus and to assess the impact of vaccines.\r"

There were 34 patients in the placebo group and 32 in the active group. Significant improvements in the placebo-treated group were obtained on subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and sneezing on isolated days during the treatment period (40%, vs 25% on day 3, 71% vs 60% on day 6, and 100% vs 67% on day 7). Improvement in nasal resistance as measured by rhinomanography was better in the placebo group than in the active group on day 7 (11% vs -6%). Our study demonstrated no beneficial effects of steam inhalation on common cold symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "We developed consensus management guidelines for patients admitted with chest pain, pulmonary edema, and syncope and used these guidelines to examine practice variation and the effects of physician feedback on decision making in 1145 consecutive admissions to three medical intensive care units. Data collection included a 6-month baseline period and two 6-month physician feedback periods. Hospital length of stay fell from 8.34 days to 7.41 and 7.14 days during feedback; intensive care unit length of stay fell from 2.45 days to 2.23 and 2.07 days. Feedback was associated with an increase in the percentage of patients conforming to the management guidelines. Multiple linear regression showed that feedback correlated with reductions of 0.79 days (confidence interval, 0.12 to 1.46) in hospital length of stay and 0.21 days (confidence interval 0.05 to 0.37) in intensive care unit length of stay. This effect was most apparent in patients not requiring any intervention, but with a major complication. During the 6-month follow-up, mortality, readmission, and urgent readmission rates were similar for patients admitted in baseline and feedback periods.\r"

In an epidemiologic sample of 215 girls and 199 boys, we identified two groups of reading-disabled children: research identified and school identified. Results indicated no significant differences in the prevalence of reading disability in research-identified boys compared with research-identified girls in either second (17[8.7%] of 196 boys; 15[6.9%] of 216 girls) or third grade (18[9.0%] of 199 boys; 13[6.0%] of 215 girls). In contrast, school identification resulted in the classification of 27 (13.6%) of 198 boys and seven (3.2%) of 216 girls in second grade and 20 (10.0%) of 199 boys and nine (4.2%) of 215 girls in third grade. Our data indicate that school-identified samples are almost unavoidably subject to a referral bias and that reports of an increased prevalence of reading disability in boys may reflect this bias in ascertainment. These findings caution against relying solely on schools for identification of reading-disabled children.\r"

Approximately 60% of patients achieved a catheter-free voiding status before dismissal from primary rehabilitation. Patients treated with early surgical stabilization of the cervical column were hospitalized a mean of 21 fewer days than their nonsurgical counterparts. In addition, patients treated with early surgical stabilization achieved their first therapeutic leave of absence from primary rehabilitation approximately 40 days sooner than patients stabilized nonsurgically. At final follow-up, however, no appreciable differences in achievement in activities of daily living and mobility were noted between patients treated with surgical stabilization of the cervical spinal column and those treated nonsurgically.\r"

These patients had the following features of this syndrome: (1) continuous muscle activity that varied with awake and sleep states, posture, passive and active movements, and medications; (2) superimposed intermittent generalized contractions while awake, which continued into drowsiness and interfered with onset of sleep; and (3) abnormal cocontractions of antagonistic muscles. The characteristic findings in the stiff-man syndrome can be recorded by using video-electroencephalographic-surface electromyographic techniques, a useful application of equipment already available in most electroencephalography laboratories. Neurophysiologic techniques can help in elucidating the clinical findings in the stiff-man syndrome. Further systematic study in patients before and during treatment is needed to identify common diagnostic criteria for this syndrome.\r"

The Critical Care & Hemodynamic Monitoring Training System consists of a personal computer, software, and a replica of a human torso designed to enable students to practice critical-care medicine. The computer displays patient histories, laboratory results, treatment options, patient responses, and a real-time cardiac monitor. The torso apparatus is used to practice insertion of a hemodynamic monitoring catheter; the cardiac monitor displays catheter pressure readings as the catheter is advanced into the heart and also pulmonary artery and wedge position. Special screen calculators in the program may be used to determine hemodynamic, respiratory, ventilatory, and renal function indices. In contrast to previously described simulators and computer oriented instructional programs, this system contains no inherent data base. Instead, authors build a library of informative cases by using the hardware and software tools provided. Individual \"modules\" of patient information are authored, and these are transparently linked as a student undertakes management of a patient. Although this system is a technologic achievement, determination of its usefulness as an instructional tool or certification aid must come from broader use and controlled studies.\r"

The apnoea index (AI, number of apnoea episodes per hour of sleep) was 6.9 (SEM 1.2) in the MI patients versus 1.4 (0.3) in the control subjects. After adjustment for age, body mass index, hypertension, smoking, and cholesterol level, multiple logistic regression analysis identified the top quartile of AI (greater than 5.3) as an independent predictor of MI patients. The relative risk for myocardial infarction between the highest and lowest quartiles of AI was 23.3 (95% confidence interval 3.9-139.9).\r"

However the antibody levels were significantly higher in the breast-fed (57 infants) than the formula-fed group (24 infants) at 7 months (mean [SD] 29.8 [32.0] vs 17.5 [14.8] micrograms/ml) and at 12 months (55 vs 26 infants; 4.8 [4.4] vs 3.0 [2.3] micrograms/ml). These findings are strong evidence that breast-feeding enhances the active immune response in the first year of life, and therefore the feeding method must be taken into account in the evaluation of vaccine studies in infants.\r"

Thus, the three forms, which have been differentiated clinically on the basis of age of onset and clinical course, are most probably due to different mutations at a single locus on chromosome 5. Prenatal diagnosis of SMA type I will now be possible.\r"

The overall mortality was higher than in an age and sex matched population. Deaths from vascular disorders were also significantly increased (60 [40 male, 20 female] versus 30.8 expected [23.5, 7.4 female]). The hazard function for vascular death was independent of age at diagnosis, time after diagnosis, calendar year of diagnosis, gender, degree of pituitary insufficiency, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Mortality risk was raised irrespective of whether hypopituitarism was due to pituitary adenoma or secondary to other diseases. 7 patients (3 male, 4 female) died from malignant diseases (expected 10.1 and 4.1, respectively). These observations indicate that life expectancy is shortened in patients with hypopituitarism. Growth-hormone deficiency could be a factor in this increased mortality from cardiovascular disease.\r"

More Latin Americans than Europeans had been sexually tortured in the AI group. Prevalence of sexual difficulties was 32%, the RCT recording a significantly higher prevalence than the AI (43% vs 20%). Sexually tortured victims were more likely to have sexual difficulties (40%) than were non-sexually tortured victims (19%). Overall, there were more cases of sexual difficulties in victims from Africa and from Turkey/Middle East/Far East than in victims from Latin America and from Europe. In the RCT subsample, prevalence of sexual difficulties and anxiety was significantly higher in sexually tortured victims than in non-sexually tortured victims; the two groups were broadly similar with respect to depression and low self-esteem. Depressed victims and victims with low self-esteem were more likely to have sexual difficulties. In the RCT group, but not overall, prevalence of sexual difficulties was significantly associated with age but was independent of low self-esteem and of depression.\r"

  ".U": "90331958\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Children with asthma commonly have positive skin tests for inhaled allergens, and in the United Kingdom the majority of older children with asthma are sensitized to the house-dust mite. In a cohort of British children at risk for allergic disease because of family history, we investigated prospectively from 1978 to 1989 the relation between exposure to the house-dust mite allergen (Der p I) and the development of sensitization and asthma. RESULTS. Of the 67 children studied in 1989, 35 were atopic (positive skin tests), and 32 were nonatopic. Of the 17 with active asthma, 16 were atopic (P less than 0.005), all of whom were sensitized to the house-dust mite, as judged by positive skin tests and levels of specific IgE antibodies (P less than 0.001). For house-dust samples collected from the homes of 59 of the children in 1979 and from 65 homes in 1989, the geometric means for the highest Der p I exposure were, respectively, 16.1 and 16.8 micrograms per gram of sieved dust. There was a trend toward an increasing degree of sensitization at the age of 11 with greater exposure at the age of 1 (P = 0.062). All but one of the children with asthma at the age of 11 had been exposed at 1 year of age to more than 10 micrograms of Der p I per gram of dust; for this exposure, the relative risk of asthma was 4.8 (P = 0.05). The age at which the first episode of wheezing occurred was inversely related to the level of exposure at the age of 1 for all children (P = 0.015), but especially for the atopic children (r = -0.66, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. In addition to genetic factors, exposure in early childhood to house-dust mite allergens is an important determinant of the subsequent development of asthma.\r"

  ".U": "90331959\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In systemic amyloidosis the distribution and progression of disease have been difficult to monitor, because they can be demonstrated only by biopsy. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a normal circulating plasma protein that is deposited on amyloid fibrils because of its specific binding affinity for them. We investigated whether labeled SAP could be used to locate amyloid deposits. METHODS. Purified human SAP labeled with iodine-123 was given intravenously to 50 patients with biopsy-proved systemic amyloidosis--25 with the AL (primary) type and 25 with the AA (secondary) type--and to 26 control patients with disease and 10 healthy subjects. Whole-body images and regional views were obtained after 24 hours and read in a blinded fashion. RESULTS. In the patients with amyloidosis the 123I-SAP was localized rapidly and specifically in amyloid deposits. The scintigraphic images obtained were characteristic and appeared to identify the extent of amyloid deposition in all 50 patients. There was no uptake of the 123I-SAP by the control patients and the healthy subjects. In all patients with AA amyloidosis the spleen was affected, whereas the scans showed uptake in the heart, skin, carpal region, and bone marrow only in patients with the AL type. Positive images were seen in six patients in whom biopsies had been negative or unsuccessful; in all six, amyloid was subsequently found on biopsy or at autopsy. Progressive amyloid deposition was observed in 9 of 11 patients studied serially. CONCLUSIONS. Scintigraphy after the injection of 123I-SAP can be used for diagnosing, locating, and monitoring the extent of systemic amyloidosis.\r"

These effects are central to cell division and morphogenesis, and embryo development. During embryo development, macroscopic patterns are frequently observed. Here we report that microtubular solutions spontaneously form alternating white and dark stripes about 1 mm wide and 1 cm long. Small-angle neutron scattering measurements show that in each segment the microtubules are aligned obliquely to the direction of the stripe, and that the white and dark stripes differ in having mutually orthogonal orientations. The formation of these structures requires an initial reservoir of organic phosphate. Phosphorus NMR measurements show that the process is accompanied by the energy-liberating conversion of organic to inorganic phosphate. These observations, together with similarities to the dissipative spatial structure formed by the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction, provide strong evidence that the observed structures are energy-dissipative in nature. Dissipative structures are thought to be critical to the appearance of complex living organisms. Our results strongly suggest that microtubules are capable of forming such structures. Microtubular dissipative structures may occur during mitosis and embryo morphogenesis.\r"

We now report a linkage study based on affected sib pairs which suggests that a gene closely linked to the HLA locus confers a greatly increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The maximum likelihood estimate is of a relative risk of approximately 21. The relationship between this suspected disease susceptibility gene (or genes) and known viral and environmental aetiological factors remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The alpha beta T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) recognizes antigenic peptides in the context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The specificity of recognition of MHC plus antigen is generally determined by a combination of the variable elements of alpha- and beta-chains of the TCR. Several types of antigen, however, have been identified that, when bound to MHC molecules, stimulate T cells bearing particular variable-region beta-chain (V beta) elements irrespective of the other variable components of the TCR. These have been termed 'superantigens', and here we are concerned with one type of superantigen, the toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. T cells have been found that bear closely related members of the same V beta family but respond differently to S. aureus toxins; in particular, cells bearing the human V beta 13.2 element respond to toxin SEC2, whereas cells bearing human V beta 13.1 do not. We have now defined the residues of the V beta element responsible for this difference, and find that they reside in a region thought to lie on the side of the TCR molecule, away from the conventional antigen/MHC-binding site. The evolutionary conservation of this site may be due to its having an important role in some function of the TCR other than the binding of conventional antigen plus MHC.\r"

  ".W": "Several exoproteins from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus are highly potent polyclonal activators of T cells in the presence of cells bearing class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These toxins, including the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), act at nanomolar concentrations, bind directly to class II molecules, and do not require the processing typical of nominal antigen. Each toxin is capable of stimulating a subpopulation of peripheral T lymphocytes bearing particular V beta sequences as part of their alpha beta T-cell receptors. It is not known how these so-called 'superantigens' bind to class II and how this binding stimulates T cells. In this study, the different affinities of TSST-1 for human class II molecules DR and DP were exploited to define the region of a class II molecule necessary for high-affinity binding. Using chimaeric alpha- and beta-chains of DR and DP expressed at the surface of transfected murine fibroblasts and a binding assay with TSST-1, it was shown that the alpha 1 domain of DR is essential for high-affinity binding, and further that TSST-1 binding did not prevent subsequent binding of a DR-restricted antigenic peptide. This is compatible with a model of superantigen making external contacts with both class II and T cell receptor, and suggests that the V beta portion of the T-cell receptor interacts with the nonpolymorphic alpha-chain of DR.\r"

  ".W": "The first phase of embryonic development in Drosophila consists of the elaboration and interpretation of maternally encoded information that specifies spatial pattern in the embryo. The product of the maternal gene bicoid (bcd) is thought to organize the anterior pattern of the embryo. Although the bcd transcript is localized at the anterior pole of the egg the bcd protein forms a stable concentration gradient through the anterior two thirds of the embryo. The graded distribution of bcd protein defines position along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo through the spatially restricted activation of subordinate targets such as the gap gene hunchback (hb). In vitro manipulation of specific bcd protein binding sites has shown that the gradient of bcd protein can in principle define more than one discrete domain of spatially restricted gene activation in the head of the embryo, depending on the affinity of the available binding sites for the bcd protein. Genetic analysis has indicated the need for at least one additional zygotic segmentation gene to mediate bcd function in portions of the head that lie anterior to the hb domain. The missing gene activity is expected to be activated in response to higher levels of bcd protein than are required for hb activation. We report here that three previously identified zygotic genes buttonhead (btd), empty spiracles (ems) and orthodenticle (otd) may behave like gap genes that mediate bcd function in the embryonic head.\r"

  ".U": "90332011\r", 
  ".W": "In the Drosophila embryo, cell fate along the anterior-posterior axis is determined by maternally expressed genes. The activity of the bicoid (bcd) gene is required for the development of larval head and thoracic structures, and that of maternal torso (tor) for the development of the unsegmented region of the head (acron). In contrast to the case of thoracic and abdominal segmentation, the hierarchy of zygotically expressed genes controlling head development has not been clearly defined. The bcd protein, which is expressed in a gradient, activates zygotic expression of the gap gene hunchback (hb), but hb alone is not sufficient to specify head development. Driever et al. proposed that at least one other bcd-activated gene controls the development of head regions anterior to the hb domain. We report here that the homeobox gene orthodenticle (otd), which is involved in head development, could be such a gene. We also show that otd expression responds to the activity of the maternal tor gene at the anterior pole of the embryo.\r"

From kinetic studies on wild-type and mutant proteins, the sequence and energetics of formation of tertiary interactions of side chains can be mapped and the formation of secondary structure inferred. Here we cross-check and complement results from this approach by using a recently developed procedure that traps and characterizes secondary structure in intermediate states using 1H NMR. The refolding of barnase is shown to be a multiphasic process in which the secondary structure in alpha-helices and beta-sheets and some turns is formed more rapidly than is the overall folding.\r"
