Dilations were performed with balloon catheters in 13 patients and with a tapered angiographic catheter in one patient. Eleven strictures were successfully dilated (79%). There were three recurrences (21%). Follow-up in nine of the 11 successful cases ranged from 12 to 61 months (mean, 29 months; median, 24 months). There were no complications directly related to balloon dilation. The high success rate in this series may be related to the early diagnosis of strictures in these closely followed patients.\r"

When large adnexal cystic structures are identified in young women with a history of surgery or trauma, the diagnosis of peritoneal inclusion cysts should be entertained. Recognition should result in conservative therapy rather than salpingo-oophorectomy.\r"

In 40 patients, image-guided catheter drainage was the primary treatment method; in three it was used after conventional, surgical chest tube placement failed. Drainage was performed with ultrasound guidance in 30 patients (69.8%), computed tomography in eight (18.6%), and fluoroscopy in five (11.6%). A combination of guidance modalities was used in six patients. Image-guided catheter drainage alone was successful in 31 of 43 patients (72.1%). In three patients (7%), empyemas were initially drained, but a thoracotomy was ultimately required because of a persistent pleural peel. In eight patients (18.6%), the procedure failed, predominantly due to tube clogging, persistent pneumothorax, or progressive development of a pleural peel. In one patient, drainage was successful but he died 10 days later of complications of renal failure. No major complications were encountered. Treatment of these patients requires a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of pleural space infection, principles of empyema drainage, techniques of abscess drainage under image guidance, and the use of a pleural drainage system.\r"

Of the 15 cases of PA, eight occurred at the arterial anastomosis and seven were nonanastomotic. Three of the eight anastomotic PAs were caused by infection. Of the seven nonanastomotic PAs, four were caused by percutaneous biopsy, two were caused by infection, and one was of undetermined cause. In nine (60%) of the 15 patients the PAs were incidentally detected at imaging studies performed for other reasons. Diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion. CT was performed in nine cases and duplex sonography in ten. The diagnosis of PA was made with CT in six (67%) patients and with duplex sonography in five (50%). CT and duplex sonography could not enable diagnosis when the PA was small, when the arterial anastomosis was not included in the field of study, or when enhancement with intravenously administered contract material was suboptimal. Angiography depicted the PAs in all 15 patients. In three liver transplant recipients with gastrointestinal tract bleeding, the causative PAs were detected only with angiography.\r"

  ".U": "88336877\r", 
  ".W": "During the early stages of its developmental program, Dictyostelium discoideum expresses cell surface cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) receptors. It has been suggested that these receptors coordinate the aggregation of individual cells into a multicellular organism and regulate the expression of a large number of developmentally regulated genes. The complementary DNA (cDNA) for the cyclic AMP receptor has now been cloned from lambda gt-11 libraries by screening with specific antiserum. The 2-kilobase messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the receptor is undetectable in growing cells, rises to a maximum at 3 to 4 hours of development, and then declines. In vitro transcribed complementary RNA, when hybridized to cellular mRNA, specifically arrests in vitro translation of the receptor polypeptide. When the cDNA is expressed in Dictyostelium cells, the undifferentiated cells specifically bind cyclic AMP. Cell lines transformed with a vector that expresses complementary mRNA (antisense) do not express the cyclic AMP receptor protein. These cells fail to enter the aggregation stage of development during starvation, whereas control and wild-type cells aggregate and complete the developmental program within 24 hours. The phenotype of the antisense transformants suggests that the cyclic AMP receptor is essential for development. The deduced amino acid sequence of the receptor reveals a high percentage of hydrophobic residues grouped in seven domains, similar to the rhodopsins and other receptors believed to interact with G proteins. It shares amino acid sequence identity and is immunologically cross-reactive with bovine rhodopsin. A model is proposed in which the cyclic AMP receptor crosses the bilayer seven times with a serine-rich cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus, the proposed site of ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation.\r"

To obtain structural information, we synthesized single and double zinc finger peptides from the yeast transcription activator ADR1, and assessed the metal-binding and DNA-binding properties of these peptides, as well as the solution structure of the metal-stabilized domains, with the use of a variety of spectroscopic techniques. A single zinc finger can exist as an independent structure sufficient for zinc-dependent DNA binding. An experimentally determined model of the single finger is proposed that is consistent with circular dichroism, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, and visual spectroscopy of the single-finger peptide reconstituted in the presence of zinc.\r"

It is shown in this study, by means of an in vitro splicing system, that nuclear extracts obtained from cells infected with HIV-1 contain a factor (or factors) that specifically inhibits splicing of a synthetic SP6/HIV pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA)-containing donor and acceptor splice sites in the coding region for the envelope protein. It is also shown that the SP6/HIV pre-mRNA is not capable of assembly in a ribonucleoprotein complex, spliceosome, in extracts from infected cells. These findings raise the possibility that specific inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing in the envelope protein coding region by HIV-1 trans-regulatory factors might be one control mechanism for efficient production of structural viral proteins and virion assembly.\r"

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin elicits the rapid release of LPL through mechanisms that are independent of energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Some of the metabolic actions of insulin may be mediated by the activation of a specific phospholipase that hydrolyzes a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecule. The insulin-sensitive glycosyl-PI is structurally similar to the glycolipid membrane anchor of a number of proteins. LPL appears to be anchored to the 3T3-L1 cell surface by glycosyl-PI, and its rapid release by insulin may be due to activation of a glycosyl-PI-specific phospholipase C.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the efficacy of the lateral decubitus position in preventing the development of pneumothorax after percutaneous needle biopsy of a well defined lung lesion. Fifty patients had such a procedure and were immediately placed in the lateral decubitus position for ten minutes, with the biopsied lung below. A chest x-ray film was obtained after the ten minute period, four to six hours later, and on the following morning. The number of pneumothoraces and the type of treatment needed in each case were recorded. Results in these 50 patients were compared to those previously obtained in 132 patients who had had an identical procedure and follow-up during the preceding four years. In all patients included as controls, we did the biopsy using an identical technique and in accordance with a specific written protocol. Both groups of patients were closely comparable in age and sex distribution, baseline values for arterial blood gases, results of prebiopsy tests of pulmonary function, and type, size, location, and distance from the pleural surface of the pulmonary lesions. A postbiopsy pneumothorax developed in 21 of 50 (42%) study patients, and in 46 of 132 (35%) controls (P not significant). Specific therapy was needed in ten (48%) and 26 (56%) of these cases, respectively (P = NS). We conclude that placing patients in the lateral decubitus position is not effective in significantly reducing the incidence of postbiopsy pneumothorax or the proportion of patients who will require specific therapy for this complication.\r"

Sclerotherapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of BEV. This trial has been designed to evaluate comparatively the effectiveness of both procedures in the initial control of the hemorrhage. Forty-three patients with BEV were included in the trial. Twenty patients (group SB) were treated by tamponade. Twenty-three patients (group ST) were treated by sclerotherapy by means of a simple technique. During the first 24 hours, hemostasis was obtained in 16 of the SB patients and in all 23 of the ST patients (p less than 0.05). At seven days, nine SB patients and 19 ST patients were free of hemorrhagic relapse (p less than 0.05). By stratifying in relation to hepatic failure, the difference was greater (p less than 0.005) if patients with Child's A classification were excluded. It is concluded that sclerotherapy should be undertaken in almost every instance at the same moment that diagnosis is made, bypassing the intermediate step of tamponade.\r"

Their ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, zinc protoporphyrin, and hemoglobin values, as well as their suitability to donate blood, were determined initially (Visit 1) and at four follow-up visits (Visits 2-5). By the second visit, the serum ferritin and iron values of donors receiving iron supplementation differed significantly from those of donors receiving placebo. By the fifth visit, a less marked but significant increase in hemoglobin had occurred in the iron group, but not in the placebo group. At no time was there a significant difference between the groups' suitability to donate blood, with each group donating at almost half of their visits. The authors conclude that iron supplementation at this dose level in deferred female blood donors improves their iron status and hemoglobin levels, but does not significantly increase their suitability to donate blood as compared with the suitability of placebo-treated donors.\r"

Microalbuminuria appeared more often in the RT patients (p = 0.023), and nerve conduction velocities were significantly reduced only in the RT group (p between 0.0005 and 0.047).

Already after 1 month's treatment with clonidine the systolic and diastolic blood pressures had decreased, from 168/103 to 161/98 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c concentrations were unaffected by 3 months' treatment. Similarly, plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations remained unchanged throughout the study (i.e. mean high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were 0.89 and 3.87 mmol/l on placebo vs. 0.90 and 3.98 mmol/l on clonidine). Adverse effects were mild and tolerable, and consisted mainly of dryness of the mouth.

  ".W": "We studied the chance of receiving dialysis and transplantation in Sweden and Stockholm based on age and sex. The number of patients accepted for chronic dialysis, divided into men and women or five age groups, were set in relation to the number of patients who died of ESRD (end-stage renal disease) in the same groups. The transplanted patients were likewise related to patients waiting on chronic dialysis. Although older patients were increasingly accepted for treatment, age is still strongly inversely correlated to acceptance. Thus in 1985, young patients aged 16-39 years had an 85% chance of being dialyzed, but patients over age 70 had only a 17% chance. Of potential male candidates, 44% received dialysis, but only 38% of women received it. Similar age, but less sex inequality, existed in the selection of patients for transplantation. In Sweden, age and sex influence the selection of patients for dialysis and transplantation.\r"

Seventy-two per cent of the patients with multiple myeloma showed beta 2-microglobulin concentrations higher than 3 mg/l with a mean of 6.84 mg/l, whereas all the patients with asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathies had concentrations lower than 3 mg/l with a mean of 1.64 mg/l. Concerning serum neopterin concentrations, 91% of the patients with multiple myeloma had values with in pathological limits (greater than 8 nmol/l) with a mean of 34 nmol/l, whereas all but one of the patients with asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy had normal values with a mean of 5.19 nmol/l. The differences thus observed in these two groups of patients are highly significant (p less than 0.001). Serum neopterin concentration, unrelated to renal insufficiency, seems to be useful in the differentiation of malignant or benign asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathies.\r"

Planar and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging studies were performed 3 days after infusion and, when possible, 7 days after infusion. Scan findings were correlated with the findings at surgery when possible. Tumor was detected by day-3 planar imaging in eight of 13 patients in whom tumor was documented histopathologically. Day-3 SPECT allowed demonstration of tumor in 11 of these 13 patients. In another patient whose scan was negative, no residual tumor was found at surgery. SPECT was particularly helpful in identifying small and midline tumors. In two cases, localization on SPECT helped identify the tumor mass on CT. Two primary tumors weighing less than 5 g could not be detected on either planar or SPECT scans. Histologically positive, normal-sized lymph nodes were not seen by planar imaging or SPECT. SPECT increased the detection rate over that achieved with planar imaging, helped to better localize scan abnormalities, and afforded more useful comparison between the monoclonal antibody study and CT.\r"

Fatty change was diffuse in smaller tumors (less than 3.5 cm) and focal in larger tumors (greater than 3.5 cm). Fatty metamorphosis characteristically caused a low-attenuation area on CT (less than -10 H) and a highly echogenic area on sonography. The sonographic appearance of small hepatocellular carcinomas with fatty metamorphosis was identical to the findings in cavernous hemangioma or focal fatty change of the liver. CT correctly revealed the presence of fat in these hepatocellular carcinomas. In these cases, hepatic arteriography showed no tumor stain; however, CT arteriography (dynamic CT during injection of contrast medium into the hepatic artery) was useful in showing the tumor, its capsule, and its internal septa. In the diagnosis of large hepatocellular carcinoma, the presence of intratumoral fat is not likely to be problematic, but small tumors that are diffusely infiltrated by fat must be distinguished from such benign conditions as focal fatty change, lipoma, and angiomyolipoma.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the radiologic and pathologic changes in 30 patients (34 joints) in which there were locally destructive bone and soft-tissue complications associated with previously inserted permanent temporomandibular joint (TMJ) Proplast-Teflon implants. The cases were selected as representative examples of patients with failed Proplast interpositional arthroplasty, in whom images of the TMJ were obtained with conventional radiography, tomography, and MR, and in whom both surgical and histologic findings were available. Clinical indications for imaging included joint pain, restricted joint motion, crepitus, preauricular swelling, regional lymphadenopathy, malocclusion either acquired or changed since implant surgery, and facial deformity. Surgery was then performed for the purposes of implant retrieval and joint debridement because of destructive soft-tissue and osseous changes observed from the imaging analysis in conjunction with significant clinical signs and symptoms. The pathologic changes, observed 4-54 months after implant surgery, included a destructive foreign-body-type granuloma and avascular necrosis of the mandibular condyle and condylar neck. Our findings suggest that MR is useful in the detection and evaluation of destructive complications that may accompany failed Proplast-Teflon implants in the TMJ. MR is superior to conventional radiography and tomography in detecting soft-tissue lesions and avascular necrosis of bone. Tomography more accurately delineates soft-tissue calcifications and cortical margins of osseous structures.\r"

Determining the presence, severity, and extent of injury poses a difficult problem because of the often confusing clinical setting. Myelography has been recommended for assessing spinal cord birth trauma but is invasive and may not be helpful. The role of sonography in evaluating spinal cord birth trauma has not been previously described. We assessed the value of sonography in four patients, three of whom also had CT metrizamide myelography. Autopsy correlation was available in three patients. Sonography was able to easily demonstrate the cord configuration, allowing for multiple assessments over time. Internal cord echogenicity was helpful in a case of hematomyelia and in demonstrating the changes of myelomalacia. Sonography is useful in evaluating neonates with severe spinal cord injury; it obviates the need for myelography and also may allow less severely injured patients to be assessed more frequently.\r"

  ".W": "To show that the position of the choroid plexus is dependent on gravity and to prove that this fact can be used as a simple means of avoiding the erroneous diagnosis of ventriculomegaly on fetal sonography, we evaluated 75 fetal sonograms retrospectively. Twenty-five fetuses had ventriculomegaly, and 50 had normal cerebral ventricles. The gestational ages ranged from 15 to 39 weeks. To show objectively that the position of the choroid plexus within the lateral ventricle was gravity dependent, we measured the choroid angle in each case. The choroid angle (the angle between the long axis of the choroid plexus and the linear midline echo on transverse axial sonograms through the body of the lateral ventricles) varied directly with ventricular size. In the group with normal-sized ventricles, the values for choroid angle followed a normal, unimodal distribution and had a mean of 14 degrees, a range of 6-22 degrees, and an SD of 4.3 degrees. In cases of ventriculomegaly, the values for choroid angle did not follow a normal distribution and ranged from 29 to 90 degrees. The choroid \"dangled\" from its attachment at the foramen of Monro and rested on the dependent wall of the lateral ventricle, resulting in a choroid angle that was increased over normal; the degree of the angle was dependent on the severity of the ventricular enlargement. The resting position of the choroid plexus marked the position of the lateral ventricular wall even when the reflection of ultrasound from the ventricular wall itself could not be seen. Detection of the position of the dependent choroid plexus is a simple observation that can be used to avoid the erroneous diagnosis of fetal ventriculomegaly and to help gauge the severity of true ventricular enlargement.\r"

  ".W": "Ferromagnetic metallic implants and materials are regarded as contraindications for MR imaging because of the potential risks associated with their movement or displacement. To date, 14 published articles have evaluated the ferromagnetic qualities of 127 different metallic implants and other materials, including aneurysm and hemostatic clips (32); dental implants and materials (five); intravascular coils, filters, and stents (13); ear implants (14); prosthetic heart valves (29); orthopedic implants and materials (eight); penile implants (nine); and miscellaneous metallic implants and materials (17). All of these materials were evaluated by measuring the deflection forces induced by static magnetic fields at strengths ranging from 0.147 to 4.7 T. This article is a compilation of the results of these studies; it lists all 127 of the materials tested, indicates whether they were found to be deflected by the static magnetic fields, and gives the highest static magnetic field strength at which they were evaluated. Of the metallic implants tested, 66 were nonferromagnetic, and 29 exhibited only minimal deflection relative to their in vivo applications (i.e., the deflection forces were thought to be insufficient to move or dislodge the implant or material in situ). The authors of these studies concluded that patients with these particular metallic implants or materials (95/127, 75%) can be examined safely by MR imaging with scanners having static magnetic field strengths up to and including those used for the specific evaluations. Patients with other ferromagnetic materials or implants may also undergo MR imaging safely; however, both careful consideration of the factors that influence the deflection of metallic implants and prudent clinical judgment are required before patients who have these objects are examined via MR imaging.\r"

  ".W": "To determine how physicians interpret exercise electrocardiography with respect to prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 29 cardiologists (all board certified) were presented a case history of a 50-year-old man with an uncomplicated AMI and asked to estimate the patient's risk of dying over the next year, the sensitivity and specificity of exercise electrocardiography with respect to 1-year mortality, and the patient's risk of dying given a positive and a negative test result. Each set of physician estimates did not differ from those derived from a review of the medical literature (difference not significant for each). Risk after the test was also calculated using the Bayes' theorem. Calculated versus estimated risks were compared after a negative (7 +/- 9 vs 11 +/- 11%) and a positive (27 +/- 22 vs 17 +/- 15%, differences not significant) test result. Estimated risks were more accurate for a negative result than for a positive one (89 +/- 10 vs 83 +/- 12%, p less than 0.001). Given a positive test result, 57% of the physicians recommended coronary angiography. However, their estimates of risk (30 +/- 23%) were not significantly different from the estimates of those physicians (14%) who recommended additional noninvasive testing (19 +/- 4%) or those (29%) who recommended medical therapy (28 +/- 26%) (difference not significant). Thus, cardiologists accurately estimated prognosis following AMI, but they were less accurate in assessing high risk than low risk, and their management decisions correlated poorly with their risk assessments.\r"

To evaluate the acute (2.5 hours) and chronic (2 weeks) effects of celiprolol (400 mg once a day) on plasma renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine, 20 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Two and one-half hours after the first dose of both placebo and celiprolol, supine and standing measurements of blood pressure showed a significant reduction, whereas plasma norepinephrine increases were comparable with baseline values. Placebo and celiprolol produced similar changes on supine blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine. In 9 patients celiprolol decreased plasma renin (from a mean +/- standard deviation of 1.09 +/- 0.35 to 0.77 +/- 0.52 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05) and aldosterone (from 9.2 +/- 3.7 to 6.7 +/- 3.9 ng/dl, p less than 0.05) acutely both supine and standing, but placebo did not change these parameters.

Mean postprandial lipemia was not significantly lower after meals containing 50 g glucose and 40 g fat than after meals containing 40 g fat alone (2.11 vs 2.42 mmol.L-1.7 h-1, p greater than 0.45) despite a substantial increase in plasma insulin concentrations after the glucose-containing meal. Ingestion of 50 g fructose and 40 g fat (4.23 mmol.L-1.7 h-1, p less than 0.0001) and 100 g sucrose and 40 g fat (3.77 mmol.L-1.7 h-1, p less than 0.001) resulted in significantly greater lipemia than did the ingestion of fat alone. These findings suggest that the ingestion of insulinogenic carbohydrates does not reduce postprandial lipemia in normolipidemic subjects and that the ingestion of fructose and fructose-containing carbohydrates may augment the postprandial lipemia induced by a fat-containing meal.\r"

Each meal consisted of one food product containing 50 g starch: spaghetti, rice, French bread, or mashed potato. Basal and postprandial glucose and insulin responses were measured for 3 h. The foods were labeled with 3.7 MBq Tc99m-albumin and GE was studied by scintigraphy for 3 h. The rate of GE (expressed by the GE half-time) was fastest for mashed potatoes, then bread, rice, and slowest for spaghetti. Blood glucose and serum insulin responses were similar. A significant negative correlation was found between the GE half-time and the maximum variation in blood glucose level (r = -0.6, p less than 0.0001). The glucose response to all four foods is strongly related to the GE rate.\r"

Subjects received each of the four liquid-formula test meals in a randomly assigned order: 1) high CHO, low fiber (HC, LF), 2) high CHO, high fiber (HC, HF), 3) low CHO, low fiber (LC, LF), and 4) low CHO, high fiber (LC, HF). On the day of each test meal the formula was consumed, eight blood samples were drawn for plasma glucose and serum insulin measurements, and a 4-h urine collection was obtained for measuring glucose excretion. Our results showed that area increments under glucose and insulin curves were significantly lower with both low-CHO formulas (p less than 0.001). The addition of soy polysaccharide to the liquid formula did not result in statistically different area increments for glucose or insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The fact that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) damage the gastroduodenal mucosa is no longer contested. Endoscopic studies in normal volunteers after NSAID administration have failed to predict which NSAIDs would be safest when administered chronically. NSAID use has been associated with a disproportionately high frequency of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation of ulcers. All of the newer NSAIDs appear to be similar in their propensity to cause mucosal damage, including peptic ulceration. On any given day, more than 10% of patients receiving NSAIDs chronically will have a gastric ulcer, a point prevalence of ulcer disease at least 5 to 10 times higher than in patients who are not taking NSAIDs. The dose-response relationship between anti-inflammatory activity and untoward events, coupled with increased use of newer more potent NSAIDs, explains, in part, the increased incidence of NSAID-associated ulcer complication of bleeding and perforation. The possible association of the increase in prevalence of Campylobacter pylori gastritis with aging and the apparent increase in NSAID-associated complications in the elderly is discussed. The current status of nonsteroidal drug therapy can be summarized as follows: 1) new NSAIDs are not safer than the old NSAIDs, as far as major gastrointestinal side effects are concerned, 2) NSAIDs should be avoided when analgesia is the main goal, 3) if NSAIDs are required, the lowest possible dose that achieves pain relief should be used, 4) newer NSAIDs available only in relatively high anti-inflammatory activity dosages should be restricted to those patients in whom high levels of anti-inflammatory activity are desired.\r"

In normal liver tissues, gamma-enolase [neuron-specific enolase (NSE)]- and S-100 protein (S-100)-positive nerve fibers were found around hepatic arteries, portal veins, and bile ductules in the portal area, along the sinusoid, and around central veins inside the hepatic lobule. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibers were detected in close contact with hepatic arteries and portal veins in the portal area and along the sinusoid in the parenchyma. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-IR nerve fibers were found in the portal area but were scarce in the parenchyma. VIP-IR nerve fibers were much fewer than NPY-IR fibers. In patients with chronic active hepatitis, NSE- and S-100-positive nerve fibers, as well as NPY-IR nerve fibers, proliferated in the enlarged portal area. In cirrhotic liver, NSE- and S-100-positive nerve fibers and NPY-IR fibers increased remarkably in the fibrous septa, whereas they decreased or vanished inside the pseudolobules. These findings suggest that, in chronic liver disease, intrahepatic nerve fibers change their distribution, accompanying the structural changes in the hepatic lobules.\r"

Pancreatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and histology of the tumor were significantly correlated with poor prognosis (p less than 0.01), but the size or ulceration of the tumor did not significantly affect the prognosis (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemically, diffuse positivity for anti-CA19-9 monoclonal antibody was demonstrated in 10 carcinomas and that for anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), in 10. Eight of them showed synchronously diffuse immunoreactivities for both antigens. Although there was no significant correlation between diffuse positivity for CA19-9 and pathologic factors, CA19-9-positive cases exhibited significantly poor prognoses (p less than 0.01). Diffuse positivity for CEA was correlated with pancreatic invasion (p less than 0.05) and poor prognosis (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical study of cancer-associated antigens may disclose some malignant potential of ampullary carcinoma other than that expressed in the morphology. Furthermore, because of the consistency of staining results, immunohistochemistry of cancer-associated antigens may also be useful in predicting preoperatively the prognosis of ampullary carcinoma in biopsied materials.\r"

The unique aspect of this case is the mixed histology of this rare neoplasm, containing both adenomatous and embryonal carcinoma, in addition to the choriocarcinoma. We believe that this unusual tumor probably results from dedifferentiation of primary adenocarcinoma of the stomach. On the average, patients with this disease live less than 2 months from the time of diagnosis, and treatment with combination chemotherapy has not improved the survival.\r"

Although all patients were included in the safety analysis, only 93 (33 percent) cefixime-treated and 99 (35 percent) amoxicillin-treated patients were fully evaluable for the efficacy analysis. One week after therapy, the evaluable patients treated with cefixime demonstrated a 90 percent clinical cure rate and a 92 percent eradication rate of the baseline pathogen. This compared with an 83 percent clinical cure rate and an 84 percent bacterial eradication rate in the amoxicillin-treated group. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (80 percent) followed by Proteus mirabilis (10 percent). One hundred thirty-seven (49 percent) of the 279 cefixime-treated and 126 (44 percent) of the 286 amoxicillin-treated patients reported at least one adverse experience during the study. Adverse reactions associated with cefixime were similar to those reported for other beta-lactam antibiotics. The most frequent adverse experiences reported by cefixime-treated patients were diarrhea (15 percent) and stool changes (12 percent). Headaches (11 percent) and diarrhea (9 percent) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions by the amoxicillin-treated patients. Eleven cefixime-treated patients (3.9 percent) and 10 amoxicillin-treated patients (3.5 percent) discontinued therapy because of adverse experiences. Results of this study demonstrate that a once-daily regimen of cefixime is as safe and effective as a three-times-daily regimen of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections. Although the incidence of bowel changes was somewhat higher in the cefixime treatment group, these events usually resolved when therapy was discontinued.\r"

Eighty percent of the 244 patients treated in the lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) study had acute bronchitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 percent), Haemophilus influenzae (28 percent), and Escherichia coli (10 percent) were the pathogens most frequently isolated from sputum in these patients. Among evaluable patients with positive bacterial culture results at baseline, a favorable clinical response (cured or improved) was obtained in 100 percent of the cefixime-treated patients (22 of 22) and in 96 percent of the amoxicillin-treated patients (23 of 24). Bacteriologic eradication rates were 100 percent and 83 percent for cefixime and amoxicillin, respectively. In the upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) study, 316 patients with pharyngitis (80 percent) or tonsillitis (14 percent) were treated. Group A, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (69 percent) and H. influenzae (8 percent) were the pathogens most frequently isolated from the throat culture specimens of these patients. Favorable clinical results were obtained in 99 percent of the evaluable cefixime-treated group (n = 73) and in 98 percent of the amoxicillin-treated group (n = 66). The bacteriologic eradication rates were 93 percent and 100 percent, respectively. The adverse experiences reported during both studies were similar in nature and frequency to those reported for other beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of a higher incidence of altered bowel movement (diarrhea and stool changes) with both drugs. These episodes usually resolved without remedial medication when the treatment was withdrawn. No significant adverse laboratory findings were observed. Results of these trials demonstrate that cefixime at a dosage of 400 mg once daily is an effective and safe oral antibiotic for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections.\r"

Large-scale clinical trials have established that lowering blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate diastolic hypertension results in a decreased incidence of stroke and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in incidence of coronary heart disease [MacMahon SW, Cutler JA, Furberg CD, et al: Prog Cardiovasc Dis 1986; 29 (suppl 1): 99-118]. Even so, the decrease in overall mortality rate is not consistent. Although hypertension occurs with increasing frequency in those over 60 years of age, patients in this age group represent less than 12 percent of the subjects in large trials. Currently, stepped-care is the recommended approach for managing hypertension in patients of all ages. However, the availability of a variety of agents for initial therapy, all with approximately equal efficacy but differing side-effect profiles, calls such an approach into question.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is a major health problem for patients over 65 years of age. Control of elevated blood pressure reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates among older hypertensive patients. Increased total peripheral vascular resistance is the primary hemodynamic abnormality in these patients. Initially, diuretics were used alone to lower total peripheral vascular resistance, and thus blood pressure, in older patients. The antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been questioned in this age group, in which low-renin hypertension is common. The latter condition might be thought to favor blood pressure control with diuretics and impair the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, recent studies with lisinopril, a new long-acting, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, indicate that reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in older hypertensive patients receiving either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy were not significantly different. These data demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy can effectively lower blood pressure in older hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "There are few studies devoted specifically to the epidemiology of older hypertensive patients, although some information has been obtained from broader trials in which either the study populations have become older or an older subgroup has been identified. Three areas have been addressed: the changes of blood pressure with age; the prevalence of hypertension in older persons; and the risks of elevated blood pressure in elderly patients. It has been found that blood pressure, especially systolic pressure, increases with age. Consequently, hypertension is extremely prevalent in this age group, affecting 65 percent or more of those over 65 years old, and the phenomenon of isolated systolic hypertension is common. Whereas in the past many physicians treating the elderly have regarded hypertension in these patients as normal and acceptable, or even helpful in ensuring adequate organ perfusion, elevated blood pressure in the elderly is far from benign. Older hypertensive patients' risks of cardiovascular complications and death are from two to five times that of normotensive persons. Treatment of diastolic hypertension in older patients can be expected to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease and improve the quality of life. Hopefully, this will prove to be true for isolated systolic hypertension as well.\r"

However, several studies have challenged this concept by demonstrating the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) in older patients, among whom a low level of renin activity in the plasma is common, and in other patients with low-renin essential hypertension. Lisinopril, a new long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, also has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent in older patients. This report examines data from 97 older and 710 younger hypertensive patients enrolled in four multicenter trials of eight to 12 weeks' duration. In these trials, the dose of lisinopril was titrated until a diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg was reached, or to a maximal dose of 80 mg per day. In general, the antihypertensive effect achieved in older patients with lisinopril was equal to or greater than that achieved in younger patients. The drug was generally well tolerated. Lisinopril can be expected to be used frequently in older patients.\r"

  ".W": "Heart failure is a common cardiovascular disorder that increases in prevalence with age. Older patients may respond differently than younger patients to the various classes of drugs used in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). The responses of older patients (at least 65 years of age) were evaluated as part of a large multicenter trial utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of CHF. A prospectively planned subgroup analysis of older CHF patients' therapeutic response to the long-acting (approximately 24-hour) ACE inhibitor lisinopril was compared with their response to captopril, a short-acting (less than eight-hour) ACE inhibitor. Symptomatic improvement occurred in both the lisinopril and captopril groups. Exercise duration also improved for patients treated with both agents. However, there was a tendency for lisinopril to be more effective than captopril (p = 0.08). Thus, the low level of renin activity often found in the plasma of older patients did not decrease the ability of the ACE inhibitors to improve effort tolerance. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased in patients treated with lisinopril but not in those treated with captopril. The improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction with lisinopril may be indicative of a more favorable prognosis in patients with CHF, since another long-acting ACE inhibitor, enalapril, reduces the rate of mortality associated with CHF. ACE inhibitors were generally well-tolerated by the older patients in the study. Therefore, ACE inhibitors appear to offer a useful therapeutic approach to the management of CHF in the older age group.\r"

Here we compare the clinical and laboratory adverse experiences in younger (under 55 years old) and older (at least 55 years old) patients treated with lisinopril monotherapy. The incidence of adverse experiences in these older patients was similar to that in the younger patients. A comparison also was made of clinical adverse experience data for older hypertensive patients treated either with lisinopril monotherapy or with various control agents (atenolol, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide) in double-blind controlled studies. In these studies, the clinical adverse experience incidences and discontinuation percentages seen in the older patients treated with lisinopril were comparable to the data from the patients treated with the control agents. Thus, lisinopril is generally well-tolerated in older hypertensive patients, and should be considered a therapeutic option in the management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "More than half of the United States population over 65 years of age has essential hypertension. In 1984, there were 10 million elderly hypertensive persons and this number will reach 25 million in the near future. These patients are at high risk for congestive heart failure, stroke, heart attack, and dissecting aneurysm. Successful reduction of blood pressure can lower these risks considerably, but rational treatment depends on understanding the complex pathophysiology of hypertension in older patients. In fact, treatment that does not take into account the combined effects of aging and hypertension on the cardiovascular system and the kidneys may do more harm than the hypertension itself. Among the prominent age-related cardiovascular changes are stiffening of the arterial tree, with or without a contribution from atherosclerosis. This reduces arterial compliance and increases afterload, resulting in the left-ventricular hypertrophy seen in old age and leading to a progressive rise in systolic pressure. There is considerable shrinkage of the kidneys, due primarily to loss of glomerular and tubular tissue in the cortex, along with sclerosis of the glomeruli and formation of tubular diverticula. Arteriolar changes lead to reduced renal blood flow, the shunting of blood around the glomeruli, and thus a reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Renal water and electrolyte excretion are changed, making homeostasis more difficult to maintain, and the renin-angiotensin system is altered, helping to blunt the kidneys' response to pressure changes. Essential hypertension superimposed on all the foregoing effects exacerbates them. Peripheral resistance is usually markedly elevated in older hypertensive persons, which increases afterload directly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated the use of level II ultrasound in predicting congenital anomalies, to determine if the management of pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes would be altered by these findings. We examined 43 insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies. In this group, 10 newborns (23%) were diagnosed either at birth or later to have an abnormality. Of these, four (9%) were diagnosed by ultrasound. Of the seven cases that were undiagnosed, three women did not undergo the level II examination, two women had lesions undetectable by ultrasound, and in two women cardiac abnormalities were missed. Of the four congenital anomalies that were prenatally diagnosed, the findings influenced the management in three cases. The level II ultrasound used as a screening test had a 67% sensitivity and a 100% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 91%. We conclude that high-resolution ultrasound may be used as a screening tool for congenital anomalies in the insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancy. This study also suggests that the use of fetal echocardiography with evaluation of aortic and pulmonary outflow tracts, the arch of the aorta, and ventricular size may be helpful in the diagnosis of fetal cardiac anomalies in the pregnant woman with insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

It has been suggested that type I diabetes is a disorder characterized by insulin deficiency and type II diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance; however, it may be hypothesized that a difference in insulin requirements should emerge throughout pregnancy to reflect the dissimilarities in these two metabolic disturbances. The current investigation of 103 women with pregestational diabetes used a novel approach (reflectance meters with onboard memories) to uncover the actual insulin dosages required to reach and maintain optimum metabolic control throughout pregnancy. It was found that both type I and type II diabetes appear to have a triphasic insulin pattern, with the patient having type II diabetes requiring significantly higher doses of insulin during each trimester. This seems to suggest that the hormonal changes in pregnancy may have a similar effect on both type I and type II diabetes but to a different degree. Thus this should be considered in the treatment of pregestational diabetes and in the development of an algorithm for diabetes management.\r"

The decreased fluid/intact membranes group had a significantly increased incidence of abnormal uterine artery waveforms (diastolic notching or absence of end-diastolic velocity); however, uterine systolic/diastolic ratios were not significantly different. The umbilical systolic/diastolic ratios were marginally higher in the intact membranes/decreased fluid group when compared with the ruptured membranes group.

Topically applied thymoxamine reversed the mydriasis from a single drop of 2.5% phenylephrine in 36 of 40 eyes (90%) within one hour. The mydriasis was completely reversed in 25 of 40 eyes (63%). Eyes with blue irides responded more quickly and more completely than did those with brown irides. The 40 contralateral eyes, which had also been dilated with phenylephrine, remained dilated or dilated further after receiving a placebo eyedrop. Twenty subjects (50%) reported mild transient ocular irritation upon instillation of thymoxamine. Thymoxamine was useful in individuals with narrow anterior chamber angles who were at risk of acute closed-angle glaucoma following dilation with an adrenergic agent.\r"

Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy was associated most frequently with anterior chamber intraocular lenses in general (155 of 271), and with Leiske style lenses in particular (100 of 271). It was associated with a visual acuity of 20/200 or less in 206 eyes and a visual acuity of counting fingers or less in 129 of the eyes at the initial examination. Penetrating keratoplasties had been performed in 189 of the eyes. After penetrating keratoplasty, 108 of 189 of the eyes had a visual acuity of 20/200 or less (mean follow-up, 15 months). Visual acuity improved with longer follow-up, and among patients with a minimum follow-up of two years, 23 of 36 eyes had a visual acuity of 20/100 or better. Most grafts were clear (145 of 189). Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy was associated with marked visual loss, which was permanent despite clear grafts in 29 of 92 eyes followed-up for one year or longer.\r"

Diflunisal therapy, 500 mg twice daily, was started in 48 patients for one week. No changes were made in their regular antiglaucoma medications. Intraocular pressure was reduced an additional 3.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (+/- S.D.) in the acetazolamide-treated patients (P less than .0001) and 1.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in methazolamide-treated patients (P less than .02), while no significant reduction in intraocular pressure was found in patients receiving topical medications alone. In 15 acetazolamide-treated patients, total plasma concentrations of acetazolamide after diflunisal therapy were significantly higher than the prediflunisal levels, suggesting a modest decrease in renal excretion. In seven acetazolamide-treated patients, free plasma concentrations of acetazolamide were found to increase 5.6-fold after diflunisal therapy. We concluded that diflunisal potentiated the ocular hypotensive effect of acetazolamide by increasing its free plasma level.\r"

With the introduction of his neurophysiologic theory of hypnosis in the early 1840s he buried Mesmer's doctrine of animal magnetism and established hypnotic phenomena as data suitable for scientific inquiry. He subsequently elaborated a sophisticated psychophysiology with emphasis on the psychology of suggestion and the phenomenon of double consciousness. His espousal of hypnotism as a tool of scientific investigation and his innovative use of hypnosis to cure hysterical paralysis profoundly influenced the debates of the 1880s and 1890s concerning suggestive therapeutics and the nature of hypnosis.\r"

Blood-injury phobia usually starts in childhood and is often familial. Unlike other phobic cues, which cause persistent tachycardia, blood-injury phobic cues evoke an initial rise in heart rate followed by vasovagal bradycardia and, frequently, syncope. Although blood-injury phobia may have an evolutionary, genetic, and physiological basis, it can be treated effectively by exposure. The tendency to faint early in exposure therapy can be reduced by lying down, tensing the muscles, or inducing anger.\r"

Transfers to the Med's \"special care\" centers were assumed to represent tertiary care referrals and were excluded. During the 92-day study interval, ED physicians at the Med handled 190 telephone requests for transfer. Requesting physicians explicitly identified \"no money\" or \"no insurance\" as the primary reason for transfer in 89 per cent of 164 cases in which these data were recorded. Thirty-seven per cent of requests were refused; half were too unstable or required an intensive care unit (ICU) bed when none were available. One hundred forty-six transfers (55 per cent) arrived without prior telephone authorization, most by private automobile. Almost all transferred patients (91 per cent) were sent for primarily economic reasons. One out of four was found to be unstable on arrival by explicit clinical criteria. Eighty-two patients transferred for economic reasons (34 per cent) required emergency hospitalization and accounted for 564 bed days during a period of extreme inpatient crowding. Three patients died prior to discharge. Two had been transferred for primarily economic reasons.\r"

Most legislation has extended abortion eligibility through traditional indications such as danger to maternal health or fetal handicap, but a number of other indications have been created such as adolescence, advanced maternal age, family circumstances, and AIDS or HIV infection. A number of countries have redesigned their abortion laws as part of a comprehensive package to facilitate access to and delivery of contraception, voluntary sterilization, and abortion services. Abortion litigation has increased and stimulated the liberalization of abortion provisions and the support of women's autonomous choice within the law. In Canada, the entire criminal prohibition of abortion was held unconstitutional for violating women's integrity and security. In contrast, Latin American and other constitutional developments may limit legal abortion to instances of danger to women's lives.\r"

The overall mortality rate in patients with obstruction secondary to carcinoma was 23 percent. Under the specific circumstances of the cases reported herein, and on the basis of a limited experience, total colectomy and left colectomy as initial procedures in acute obstruction secondary to cancer had the same mortality rate as staged resection of the left colon. The only benefit found from either approach was an increase in the disease-free 5 year survival rate with staged resection. The overall survival rate was not enhanced by either approach.\r"

After review of the literature, I concluded that (1) the poor record of the Whitehead hemorrhoidectomy is due to the confusing and oftentimes misleading terminology of the anorectal anatomy found in early texts, and (2) this technique, or one of its modifications, is a viable treatment option for patients with circumferential, prolapsing, mixed hemorrhoids.\r"

The first and second phases of insulin release were both impaired in animals treated with CsA compared with controls (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively). The negative impact of CsA on the beta cells was easily demonstrated in this in vitro study. Similar results are more difficult to achieve with purely in vivo models, probably due to the great redundancy of the islet mass in intact animals. The mechanism of this CsA toxicity remains to be defined.\r"

The mortality rate for the children with pancreatitis was 17 percent and was limited to patients treated nonoperatively. Idiopathic and drug-induced pancreatitis (the latter, particularly from corticosteroids) were the predominant types. Only rarely should such patients undergo operative treatment. Operations performed for various obstructive or traumatic lesions of the pancreas, as well as for complications of pancreatitis, obtained uniformly good results. The most common congenital malformation of the pancreas was an annular pancreas in association with duodenal atresia; all children with this abnormality were successfully treated with bypass procedures. Four patients with an ectopic pancreas underwent successful wedge resection. Nine infants with nesidioblastosis or islet cell hyperplasia and three children with islet cell adenomas underwent successful resection without any deaths, although neurologic sequelae due to prolonged preoperative hypoglycemia were common. Two patients underwent radical resection for pancreatic carcinoma, one of whom had survived 20 years postoperatively at last follow-up. Pancreatic disorders requiring operation in childhood are uncommon, but are likely to be complex and challenging when they do occur.\r"

The 60 day survival rates were significantly better in Groups 2 and 4 than in Groups 1 and 3. The anhepatic phase was significantly shorter with the cuff and splinting techniques than with the microsurgical technique, and total hepatic ischemic time was significantly shorter in the splint group than in the other three groups. Hepatic failure and shock had a higher incidence in those groups displaying a longer total hepatic ischemia time and a longer anhepatic phase. The results of this study show that the two-cuff technique and the splinting technique have substantial advantages over the microsurgical technique and the three-cuff technique. In particular, the splinting technique is preferable to the two-cuff technique because total hepatic ischemia time is shorter, and it is faster for a well-trained microsurgeon to learn this procedure than to learn the cuff technique de novo.\r"

To define the limitations imposed by oxygenators, we defined washin and washout curves for volatile anesthetic agents administered to bubble oxygenators primed with diluted blood (without connection to a patient). There was rapid equilibration of anesthetic partial pressure between delivered gas and blood (85-90% within 16 minutes). Increasing the gas inflow to the oxygenator from 3 to 12 L/min hastened washin and washout slightly, while increasing the pump blood flow from 3 to 5 L/min had no effect. Rates of washin and washout of anesthetics differed as a function of their blood/gas solubilities: enflurane greater than isoflurane greater than halothane during washin; isoflurane greater than enflurane greater than halothane during washout. However, these differences were small. Oxygenator exhaust partial pressures of anesthetic correlated with simultaneously obtained blood partial pressures, suggesting that monitoring exhaust gas may be useful clinically.\r"

The degree of extracranial internal or common carotid narrowing in these patients was classified by standard Vmax Doppler criteria as 0-40%, 40-80%, and 80-100% luminal diameter reduction. The authors found that 87% of the patients had little or no carotid stenosis (0-40% luminal diameter reduction). Nevertheless, 79% of the previous strokes had occurred in these patients, and the incidence of strokes in this group was 21%. Severe, but not mild or moderate, degrees of carotid obstruction (80-100% luminal diameter reduction) were associated with a 100% stroke incidence. The authors conclude that strokes most commonly result from causes other than ischemia due to in situ severe extracranial internal or common carotid stenosis or occlusion.\r"

  ".U": "88339022\r", 
  ".W": "It is a well-known fact that systemic hypertension is one of the major risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI). Extensive studies on hypertensive rats revealed that calcium is excessively elevated in the myocytes, as well as in the coronary artery wall of these animals, which results in a higher resting tension and a stronger contractile response of those muscle strips. Over many years coronary spasm has been claimed by various authors to be greatly involved in the pathophysiology of early phase of acute MI (AMI). It can be shown that thrombocytes that aggregate at the injured vessel wall next to atherosclerotic plaques release vasoconstrictive factors that induce series of severe spasms at the sites with defective endothelium that end up in myocardial infarction; the pathophysiologic pathway is called the thrombo-ischemic reentry mechanism. This local contractile response may be enhanced in the presence of systemic hypertension since intracellular calcium is elevated in the coronary smooth muscle. On the other hand, it has been shown that heart muscle fibers undergo severe alterations finally resulting in necrotization, as soon as free calcium ions penetrate excessively through the sarcolemma membrane into the myoplasm so that the capacities of the calcium binding or extrusion processes become overpowered; this is especially the case during ischemia. Since free intracellular calcium is already ten times elevated in the myocytes in systemic hypertension, the myocardium may be more vulnerable to further calcium overload owing to the ischemia and necrotization is augmented. The elevation of intracellular Ca of the myocytes of the cardiovascular system in systemic hypertension enhances the pathologic response of the coronary arteries and the myocardium. This work gives a complete overview of the pathophysiologic principles involved in AMI occurring with systemic hypertension.\r"

At entry, the two groups (83 ticlopidine, 86 placebo) were well matched for the major clinical features apart from an excess of women in the ticlopidine group. At six months, 167 patients were alive, 2 having died of malignant disease (1 from each group). At this stage, 39 patients from the ticlopidine group and 29 from the placebo group (p = 0.04) had increased their walking distance by more than 50% of baseline values. For the groups as a whole pain-free and total walking distance were greater in the ticlopidine group than in the placebo group (194 vs 124 meters, p = 0.03 and 236 vs 170 meters, p = 0.04, respectively). Two patients from the ticlopidine group vs 9 patients from the placebo group (p = 0.03) developed significant cardiovascular events during the study. These results indicate that ticlopidine has a beneficial effect both in the treatment of the symptoms and the prevention of vascular complications in patients with intermittent claudication.\r"

DESIGN: Lysosomal membrane transport studies, clinical reports, and a historically controlled 7-year trial of oral cysteamine therapy. SETTING: University centers in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-eight children, aged 0 to 12, with nephropathic cystinosis before renal transplant, who had renal tubular Fanconi syndrome, failure to grow, corneal cystine crystals, and elevated leukocyte cystine; 34 patients, aged 9 to 29, after transplant, some with visual impairment, corneal erosions, pancreatic dysfunction, or neurologic deterioration. INTERVENTION: Before transplant, replacement of renal losses, and treatment with oral cysteamine (55 mg/kg body weight.d for 1 to 6 years) and topical cysteamine eyedrops (0.1%, 1 drop/h while awake, for 6 months). After transplant, oral cysteamine and symptomatic treatment of late complications. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Untreated patients reached renal failure at age 10. Oral cysteamine lowered leukocyte cystine over 80%, and in patients before transplant, improved growth and preserved renal function (mean creatinine clearance [+/- SE], 0.64 +/- 0.04 mL/s.1.73 m2 [38.5 +/- 2.5 mL/min.1.73 m2] in the cysteamine group compared with 0.50 +/- 0.03 mL/s.1.73 m2 [29.7 +/- 2.0 mL/min.1.73 m2] in controls; 95% CI for the difference, 1.8 to 15.8). Cysteamine eyedrops cleared the corneal crystals of two children less than 2 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes. In young children, growth can be improved and renal deterioration delayed or prevented by oral cysteamine. Nonrenal complications after transplant might be prevented with long-term oral cysteamine.\r"

  ".U": "88339110\r", 
  ".W": "During the past decade, the therapy for stable angina pectoris has greatly expanded with the introduction of the calcium-channel blockers. Initially studied as monotherapy, these agents have been regularly used in combination with other antianginal medications, most notably the beta-adrenergic blockers. Although there are pharmacologic rationales for combining these agents, in daily practice, the major impetus for combination therapy is continuing angina during monotherapy. At least one well-conducted double-blind study was done to confirm that diltiazem, verapamil, and nifedipine each can markedly improve both subjective and objective measures of efficacy when used in combination with a beta-blocker. However, individual patient responses are of chief importance. Many persons do better with monotherapy than with combination treatment. The offsetting hemodynamic effects of nifedipine and a beta-blocker generally work well together; however, minor side effects are not infrequent. In the patient with underlying conduction system disease, this combination is clearly preferable. Diltiazem with a beta-blocker is usually well-tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse effects, similar to the experience with diltiazem monotherapy. Verapamil in conjunction with a beta-blocker warrants the greatest concern; approximately 10% to 15% of patients will have significant bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, or congestive failure. When these agents are used concurrently, reduced dosages, especially of the beta-blocker, will likely result in a lower incidence of adverse effects with maintained efficacy.\r"

Most of the reports on cardiac rehabilitation are about patients who have coronary artery disease and a history of myocardial infarction. The review, therefore, is focused primarily on the patient who has had a myocardial infarction. Effects of cardiac rehabilitation, emphasizing exercise treatment and conditioning, are reviewed with regard to patient outcomes, including changes in functional (work) capacity, psychosocial functioning and health-related knowledge, risk factor modification, morbidity and mortality, and cardiac function. The safety of cardiac exercise programs is reviewed, and the use of telemetry monitoring is considered. We also discuss the role of cardiac rehabilitation in categories of patients other than those with myocardial infarction and the application of newer approaches to rehabilitation such as programs based in the patient's home.\r"

  ".W": "Since November 1985, 14 neonates and young infants have undergone orthotopic heart transplantation at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) as therapy for hypoplastic aortic tract complex. Eleven (78%) survived surgery and are living and well today. Three perioperative deaths resulted: one due to perforated peptic ulcer, one due to necrotizing pneumonitis, and one due to graft failure unrelated to rejection. No late deaths occurred in the 1-29 months of follow-up, during which time noninvasive surveillance techniques were used. Immunosuppression was accomplished using cyclosporine and azathioprine. Steroids and antithymocyte globulin were used for identified rejection episodes only. Ordinary childhood infections were tolerated well. All survivors were normotensive. There was no late renal dysfunction. Although inadequate donor resources remain a significant limiting factor for transplantation therapy during early life, these results suggest that cardiac transplantation is effective therapy for selected neonates and young infants with incurable congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "This communication presents an 11-center prospective randomized trial using the artificial dermis invented by Burke and Yannas. Patients with life-threatening burns who underwent primary excision and grafting within 7 days of injury had comparable sites randomized to receive either the artificial dermis (study site) or the investigator's usual skin grafting material (control site). Control materials were autograft, allograft, xenograft, or a synthetic dressing. Epidermal grafts were applied to the study site during a second operation, and surviving patients were followed for 1 year after grafting. One hundred thirty-nine sites on 106 patients were studied. Mean burn size was 46.5 +/- 15% mean total body surface (TBSA). Overall mortality was 13%, and mean hospital stay was 68 +/- 45 days. Median artificial dermis take was 80% compared with 95% for all comparative sites, but the take was equivalent to that of all nonautograft control materials. Results with the artificial dermis improved slightly as the investigators became more familiar with the material. Donor site thickness for the study site averaged .006'' +/- .002'' compared to .013'' +/- .018'' for control (p less than .0001) and the epidermal donor site healed an average of 4 days sooner (10 +/- 6 vs. 14 +/- 8 days) (p less than .0001). As the wounds matured during the first year, both patients and surgeons felt that both sites became more comparable in appearance and function. At the completion of the study, there was less hypertrophic scarring of the artificial dermis, and more patients preferred the artificial dermis to the control graft. Artificial dermis with an epidermal graft provides a permanent cover that is at least as satisfactory as currently available skin grafting techniques, and uses donor grafts that are thinner and donor sites that heal faster.\r"

Of these patients, 127 (85%) underwent resection; 23 (18.1%) were of a palliative nature. More than 75% had Stage III and IV disease. One patient (0.8%) died within 30 days of the operation of a myocardial infarct. Two other patients failed to leave the hospital. Of 25 postoperative complications, 14 (11%) were considered major. Palliation of dysphagia was successful in 80% of patients. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 22.4%. Of patients with Stage I and II disease, 36.6% survived for 5 years, and of patients with Stage III disease, 22.5% survived. No patient with Stage IV disease lived for longer than 1 year. It is concluded that limited esophagogastrectomy can be performed in most patients with carcinoma of the cardia with low mortality and morbidity and with satisfactory long-term survival.\r"

Although some improvement, or at least stability, of pulmonary function has followed augmented immune suppression, it appears that once the process is recognized clinically, much of the damage to the airways is irreversible. The histopathology, response to therapy, and, most important, the response of donor specific alloreactivity in the lymphocytes from the lung (bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood) suggest immune- mediated basis for bronchiolitis obliterans. The presence of donor specific alloreactivity detected by primed lymphocyte testing predicted obliterative bronchiolitis in five of six recipients (83% sensitivity, 91% specificity) was absent in ten of eleven recipients who have not as yet developed the process (negative predicted value of 91%). Currently, the presence of a positive primed lymphocyte test in the bronchoalveolar lavage of the cardiopulmonary recipient is an indication for early treatment by augmented immune suppression.\r"

These infusions resulted in dose-dependent physiologic and neuroendocrine effects consistent with central cholinergic stimulation. Infusions were generally well tolerated. No statistically significant improvement in performance on most cognitive tasks assessing knowledge memory and episodic learning and memory was observed at any dose, although marginal improvement in picture recognition ability and in ratings of word-finding were observed at the lower doses. Psychomotor activation and slightly improved affect were reliably observed at the lower doses, whereas increasing psychomotor retardation was observed at the highest dose. The data support a role for central cholinergic modulation of some aspects of cognition, behavior, and affect in this population. The apparent greater behavioral sensitivity of patients with Alzheimer's disease in comparison with subject populations previously studied, as well as the altered dose responsiveness, merit further study in relationship to normal aging.\r"

  ".W": "In an intensive multidrug, multidose study, nine elderly depressed patients were administered 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg of scopolamine hydrobromide, 1 mg of oral lorazepam, and placebo in a double-blind investigation aimed at assessing the status of the central cholinergic nervous system in geriatric depression. Significant cognitive and behavioral effects of scopolamine were observed only at the high dose (0.5 mg), while lower doses and lorazepam showed no significant differences from placebo. Cognitive deficits caused by scopolamine were in the areas of new learning, access to semantic memory, vigilance, and continuous performance. Behavioral effects consisted of activation, restlessness, and anxiety, but there was no significant effect on depressed mood. These results suggest that elderly depressed patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment seem to be more similar to previously studied elderly controls rather than to patients with Alzheimer's disease in their reaction to short-term cholinergic blockade, and suggest that the cognitive and mood changes often seen in geriatric depression may involve factors other than disturbed muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms.\r"

Both groups of depressed patients (under 50 and over 60 years of age) exhibited significant reductions (decreases 42%) in the number of platelet-tritiated imipramine binding sites with no change in affinity, when compared with their age-matched controls. There was little overlap in Bmax values between the elderly depressed patients and their controls. The patients with probable Alzheimer's disease showed no alteration in platelet-tritiated imipramine binding. There was no statistically significant relationship between postdexamethasone plasma cortisol concentrations and tritiated imipramine binding. These results indicate that platelet-tritiated imipramine binding may have potential utility as a diagnostic adjunct in geriatric depression, and moreover that the reduction in the number of platelet-tritiated imipramine binding sites is not due to hypercortisolemia.\r"

The importance of disruption of biological rhythms on the one hand, and psychosocial losses on the other, in the causation of depressive episodes suggest one possible unifying hypothesis. The concept of loss of \"social zeitgebers,\" ie, persons, social demands, or tasks that set the biological clock, may provide the link between biological and psychosocial theories of etiology. We suggest that a disruption of social rhythms, which may result in instability in biological rhythms, could be responsible for triggering the onset of a major depressive episode in vulnerable individuals.\r"

Epidemiologic findings have shown that autism is a rare disorder with a prevalence of two to five per 10,000, a male-female ratio of 3:1, and an association with mental retardation (66% to 75% of autistic subjects have full-scale IQ scores [70]). Autism is familial, as reflected in an empiric sibling recurrence risk of 3% and pooled monozygotic and dizygotic concordance rates of 64% and 9%, respectively, which are much greater than the population prevalence of 0.02% to 0.05%. Genetic heterogeneity is pronounced with potential genetic subgroups, including autosomal recessive inheritance, X-linked inheritance, and sporadic chromosomal anomalies. Studies of subclinical markers in autism have elucidated potential markers at various levels of phenotypic expression from the DNA to the behavioral level. Linkage and cytogenetic studies point to two chromosome regions as putative markers, 9q34 and Xq27. Results of family studies support a putative biochemical marker, low levels of plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and a putative cognitive marker, ie, normal visuospatial but low verbal functioning, in autism. The frequency of minor physical anomalies and presence or absence of mental retardation are two dimensions of the physical and behavioral phenotype that may demark etiologically distinct subgroups. Genetic heterogeneity is offered as one explanation of the observed sex difference in the prevalence of autism. Directions for potentially fruitful research should be considered.\r"

Laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, IgG, IgM, and IgA) also improved during the active treatment, suggesting a beneficial effect of sulfasalazine on AS. At the end of the treatment, significant differences between the sulfasalazine and placebo groups were observed in morning stiffness, chest expansion, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and in all immunoglobulin classes. Two patients in each treatment group discontinued the trial because of side effects. Enteric-coated sulfasalazine seemed to be effective and well tolerated in patients with active AS.\r"

Test sequence strategies were constructed by Bayesian inference using a computer program written for this purpose. Test sequences were compared with an aggressive strategy consisting of repeated tests until there was a positive finding or until the available tests were exhausted, and a conservative strategy consisting of 1 biopsy procedure plus angiography. The Bayesian analysis agreed most closely with the conservative approach for most prior probabilities (degree of suspicion) that a patient had PAN. The aggressive strategy had an overall sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91%, whereas the conservative strategy was 85% sensitive and 96% specific. Furthermore, the aggressive strategy was more costly ($2,986 versus $1,961) and had a higher rate of morbidity (3.8 versus 2.7 days of hospitalization per patient evaluated) than did the conservative strategy. The mortality rates of both strategies were equivalent (approximately 0.05 deaths per hundred patients evaluated). The per-case cost of diagnosis increased as prevalence decreased, and at 10% prevalence, the aggressive strategy cost more than $17,000 per case diagnosed. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the strategies were moderately affected by the test characteristics, within reasonable assumptions, but that the differences in conservative and aggressive approaches remained. Thus, our analysis based on available data and the assumption of test independence suggests that the preferred diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of PAN consists, in most cases, of a single biopsy procedure, with angiographic evaluation if necessary.\r"

Test specificity was calculated by reviewing pathology and radiology reports on all relevant procedures done at the University of Chicago Medical Center in 1984 and 1985. There were no reports of false-positive findings (including angiography); thus, test specificity was 100% for muscle, nerve, kidney, liver, and testicular biopsy, which was comparable with our literature-based estimate of 97%. Test sensitivity was based on the 18 confirmed cases of PAN from the 3 institutions and was similar to that in published reports, ranging from 0% for liver biopsy to 100% for visceral angiography. Review of each case for diagnostic test sequence showed an average of 2 diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis (range 1-6). Eight of 18 patients were evaluated according to the conservative strategy we proposed from our literature-based decision analysis approach. No patient was evaluated with the aggressive strategy, although 1 patient had 6 invasive procedures. Of the remaining 10 patients, 9 represented cases that might have been confirmed had the conservative approach been used, and if it had been used, 6 patients would have had the diagnosis confirmed. Thus, the minimum sensitivity of our conservative strategy is 78%, although based on these data, it could be as high as 100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were supervised by the same medical fitness instructors. Patients in neither group had contact with members of the other group, and were blinded as to the exercise taught to the alternative group. Groups met for 60 minutes 3 times each week. The compliance rate was 90%. Thirty-eight patients completed the study (18 with CVR training and 20 with FLEX). Blind assessments (standardized in preliminary trials to achieve acceptable inter-rater agreement) were performed by the same 2 examiners. After 20 weeks, patients receiving CVR training showed significantly improved cardiovascular fitness scores compared with those receiving FLEX training (t[35] = -4.22, P less than 0.003). Logistic regression analysis showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain threshold scores, which were measured directly over fibrositic tender points, in patients undergoing CVR (t[35] = 2.21, P less than 0.04). There was also a trend toward improvement in pain scores (visual analog scale) in the CVR group, but this did not reach statistical significance. There was no improvement in the percentage of body area affected by fibrositic symptoms or the number of nights per week or hours per night of disturbed sleep (self-report inventories). However, compared with the FLEX group, the CVR-trained patients improved significantly in both patient and physician global assessment scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Detailed histopathologic examinations of knee joints in both the early and the late phase of arthritis revealed an obvious synovial and cartilage iron load, in the absence of inflammatory changes. The implications of these findings in the pathogenesis of destructive cartilage changes are discussed.\r"

The FA decay reflects two molecular processes in all cases: local internal fluctuations of the tryptophan side chain with a relaxation time of 200-500 ps, and motions of the whole polypeptide molecule with a relaxation time of 9-10 ns. The amplitudes of the fast fluctuation are largest at the helix ends and decrease toward the center of the helix. A similar observation was made for the helical polypeptides dissolved in organic solvents showing that the mobility gradient along the polypeptide sequence is an inherent property of the polypeptide helix and not due to the lipid bilayer. However, the amplitudes of the fast fluctuations can be modulated by the physical state of the lipid bilayer. With decreasing temperature, the internal mobility of the tryptophan in all positions decreases with an abrupt change at the lipid-phase transition. Concomitant molecular dynamics calculations indicate a correlation between the fast FA decay and conformational fluctuations within the helix. According to the simulation, the conformation of the polypeptide is on average predominantly helical, but actually the molecule can fluctuate between a variety of different substructures. The conformational fluctuations are largest at the helix ends and provide the free space required for rotation of the indole ring around the tryptophan side chain bonds.\r"

The present study was undertaken in order to assess whether an oral glucose/electrolyte solution designed for fluid replacement (Na+ concentration 75 mmol/l) and an oral glucose/electrolyte solution designed for maintenance of hydration (Na+ concentration 45 mmol/l) would be safe and effective in the treatment of acute childhood diarrhea in a developed country. Children aged 3-24 months (n = 54) with acute diarrhea and less than 5 percent dehydration were randomized to receive either maintenance (n = 27) or rehydration (n = 27) fluid. Outcome was assessed at 24 and 48 hours after entry to the study. Both solutions were found to be equally effective and safe. The fluid was refused by one child in each group. Analysis of efficacy showed that hydration status was maintained in all patients and 98 percent of children showed significant improvement in diarrheal status at 24 hours. We conclude that for well-nourished ambulatory children aged 3-24 months with acute diarrhea and minimal (less than 5%) or no dehydration, the use of an oral fluid containing 75 mmol/l of sodium is as safe and effective as the use of an oral fluid containing 45 mmol/l of sodium.\r"

During the second and third weeks after the onset of illness p24 antibody was detected by Western blot assay and antigen concentrations rapidly decreased to undetectable values. Dissociation of antigen-antibody complexes showed complexed antigen during the phase of declining concentrations of free antigen. Neither free nor complexed antigen was detected in any serum samples for several months thereafter, which suggested that failure to detect HIV antigen reflected low or absent synthesis of viral protein rather than masking of antigen by antibodies. Reappearance of HIV antigen with a fall in p24 antibody concentration was observed in a few patients six months or more after the onset of disease. The combined use of antigen and antibody assays made it possible to obtain evidence of infection with HIV in all of the 95 serum samples tested, illustrating the usefulness of these assays for diagnosing infection with HIV in its early stages.\r"

  ".W": "Although wide surgical excision is the accepted treatment for thin malignant melanomas, there is reason to believe that narrower margins may be adequate. We conducted a randomized prospective study to assess the efficacy of narrow excision (excision with 1-cm margins) for primary melanomas no thicker than 2 mm. Narrow excision was performed in 305 patients, and wide excision (margins of 3 cm or more) was performed in 307 patients. The major prognostic criteria were well balanced in the two groups. The mean thickness of melanomas was 0.99 mm in the narrow-excision group and 1.02 mm in the wide-excision group. The subsequent development of metastatic disease involving regional nodes and distant organs was not different in the two groups (4.6 and 2.3 percent, respectively, in the narrow-excision group, as compared with 6.5 and 2.6 percent in the wide-excision group). Disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates (mean follow-up period, 55 months) were also similar in the two groups. Only three patients had a local recurrence as a first relapse. All had undergone narrow excision, and each had a primary melanoma with a thickness of 1 mm or more. The absence of local recurrence in the group of patients with a primary melanoma thinner than 1 mm and the very low rate of local recurrences indicate that narrow excision is a safe and effective procedure for such patients.\r"

Immediate recovery was more rapid in the alfentanil group (P less than 0.01), but apnoea (P less than 0.05) and hiccups (P less than 0.05) were more common. Except for the CFF test, which showed the alfentanil patients to be less sedated than the halothane patients on the morning after anaesthesia (P less than 0.05), the results of the tests were similar in both groups and showed, initially, substantial impairment of psychomotor functions which gradually returned to baseline values.

No definitive treatment has as yet been devised for this condition, which shows a marked variability in clinical course. To evaluate whether excessive hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation could be controlled by recombinant human interferon alpha (rIFN-alpha) and gamma (rIFN-gamma), we studied the effects of these agents on the in vitro growth of pluripotent and lineage-restricted circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells in 18 patients with MMM. A significant increase in the growth (mean +/- 1 SEM) per milliliter of peripheral blood of CFU-GEMM (594 +/- 253), CFU-Mk (1,033 +/- 410), BFU-E (4,799 +/- 2,020) and CFU-GM (5,438 +/- 2,505) was found in patients as compared with normal controls. Both rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma (10 to 10(4) U/mL) produced a significant dose-dependent suppression of CFU-GEMM, CFU-Mk, BFU-E, and CFU-GM growth. Concentrations of rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma causing 50% inhibition of colony formation were 37 and 163 U/mL for CFU-GEMM, 16 and 69 U/mL for CFU-Mk, 53 and 146 U/mL for BFU-E, and 36 and 187 U/mL for CFU-GM, respectively. A marked synergistic effect was found between rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma: combination of the two agents produced inhibitory effects greater than or equivalent to those of 10- to 100-fold higher concentrations of single agents. These studies (a) confirm that circulating hematopoietic progenitors are markedly increased in MMM, (b) indicate that these presumably abnormal progenitors are normally responsive to rIFNs in vitro, and (c) show that IFNs act in a synergistic manner when used in combination. Because rIFN-gamma can downregulate collagen synthesis in vivo, this lymphokine could be particularly useful in the treatment of patients with MMM.\r"

Southern blot analysis showed that Kit 225 is not infected with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) type I or II, and is probably derived from the major clone in the fresh leukemic cells. Kit 225 cells express a large amount of IL 2 receptors constitutively and their growth is absolutely dependent on IL 2. No other stimuli, such as lectins or antigens, are required for maintaining the responsiveness to IL 2. As abnormal IL 2 receptor expression was also seen originally in the fresh leukemic cells, the establishment of this cell line with IL 2 suggests that IL 2-mediated T cell proliferation is involved in the leukemogenesis of some cases of HTLV-negative T-CLL.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet adherence at high wall shear rates requires plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF). Clinically, the ristocetin cofactor (RCof) activity is the only widely available assay for vWF function. When purified vWF is treated with neuraminidase to yield asialo-vWF (AS-vWF), its RCof activity is increased by 20% to 40%. AS-vWF binds to normal human platelets independently of ristocetin and induces platelet aggregation in the presence of fibrinogen. To determine whether AS-vWF also shows an enhanced capacity to support platelet adherence to subendothelium, we used the Baumgartner technique. Intact vWF, AS-vWF, or AS-vWF treated with beta-galactosidase (asialo, agalacto-vWF; AS,AG-vWF) was added to normal citrated whole blood before perfusion over human umbilical artery segments (wall shear rate, 2,600 sec-1). Four micrograms per milliliter AS-vWF caused a 69% reduction in total platelet adherence compared with citrated whole blood (P less than .001), and 4 micrograms/mL AS,AG-vWF led to a 48% reduction (P less than .005). With 4 micrograms/mL intact vWF, the platelet adherence values were not significantly different from the controls. No significant differences in subendothelial platelet thrombi or postperfusion platelet counts were evident among any of the groups. In reconstituted afibrinogenemic perfusates, 4 micrograms/mL AS-vWF caused a 42% reduction in platelet adherence (P less than .05). Thus, AS-vWF is a potent inhibitor of platelet adherence, despite its enhanced RCof specific activity. Abnormalities in vWF carbohydrate may play a role in impaired primary hemostasis in some patients with von Willebrand's disease.\r"

B-CLL lymphocytes were costimulated with anti-mu antibody (Ab) and with three growth factor preparations: recombinant IL2, B cell growth factor (BCGF) (20 kiloDalton (kD) BCGF) and a high molecular weight BCGF (50 kD BCGF). IL2 was the more active factor (in six of 11 patients). The effect of IL2 was dependent on a costimulation with anti-mu Ab or occurred independently of anti-mu Ab, according to the patients. This pattern of reactivity did not correlate with the presence or absence of the IL2 receptor (IL2-R) molecule on fresh B-CLL lymphocytes. Five patients responded to the 20 kD BCGF. Although four of them were also strong responders to IL2, one strongly responded to the 20 kD BCGF and did not respond to IL2. Only one patient responded to the 50 kD BCGF. When an anti-IL2-R Ab was introduced into the culture, only the responsiveness to IL2 was abolished: thus both 20 kD and 50 kD BCGFs activate B-CLL lymphocytes independently of the IL2-R. These results show that several B cell directed growth factors can act independently to support the proliferation of B-CLL lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a lysosomal enzyme present in the azurophilic granules of human neutrophils and monocytes and is important for optimal oxygen-dependent killing of microorganisms. The native molecule is a heterodimer composed of a pair of heavy-light protomers, each containing a 59-kDa and 13.5-kDa subunit. The intracellular processing during biosynthesis of MPO was examined in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Endoglycosidase H and F digestion of immunoprecipitated pro-MPO demonstrated the presence of five N-linked--high-mannose oligosaccharide side chains and no complex mannose units. Incorporation of the threonine analogue beta-hydroxynorvaline produced species approximately 2.5 kDa and approximately 5 kDa smaller than the fully glycosylated pro-MPO, suggesting that two of the glycans were in the asparagine-X-threonine tripeptide sequence. Processing of pro-MPO occurred very rapidly, within approximately five minutes, and was best identified using glucosidase inhibitors. The presence of such inhibitors resulted in synthesis of a 92-kDa glycoprotein rather than the usually identified 89-kDa peptide. Swainsonine, a Golgi mannosidase inhibitor, did not alter the size of the earliest synthesized protein, suggesting that pro-MPO exited the endoplasmic reticulum or cis-Golgi proximal to the site of mannosidases. Intracellular transport and proteolytic maturation of MPO was retarded by weak bases (NH4Cl, chloroquine) or monensin at concentrations shown to raise intralysosomal pH. However, these agents did not qualitatively alter transport nor increase secretion. Thus, although MPO biosynthesis resembled that of other lysosomal enzymes, significant differences exist, including only limited oligosaccharide processing and intracellular transport and proteolytic maturation of pro-MPO that was only retarded by alkalinizing lysosomes without affecting the products or the fraction of pro-MPO secreted. Characterization of the determinants for targeting and of the regulatory factors in processing lysosomal enzymes in myeloid cells will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying common disorders such as myeloperoxidase deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Interferons (IFNs) have been shown to suppress the proliferation of human pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells, CFU-GEMM, and committed erythroid (BFU-E, CFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells. However, no information is yet available concerning the effect of IFNs on human megakaryocytic progenitor cells CFU-Mk. Furthermore the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory activity of IFNs are still controversial. Therefore highly purified recombinant IFN preparations, rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma, were assessed for their influence on in vitro growth of human bone marrow-derived CFU-Mk as well as CFU-GEMM. In addition, the role of hematopoietic accessory cells, that is, adherent cells and T lymphocytes, in the mediation of the suppressive effect of rIFNs was examined. When added to unseparated bone marrow cells, both rIFN preparations significantly inhibited colony formation with 50% inhibition of CFU-Mk occurring at 22 U/mL for rIFN-alpha and 59 U/mL for rIFN-gamma, while 50% inhibition of CFU-GEMM occurred at 59 U/mL for rIFN-alpha and 101 U/mL for rIFN-gamma. The suppressive effect of rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma was selectively abolished by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma, thus confirming that the inhibitory activity was due to the rIFN preparations used. The antiproliferative effect of rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma on CFU-GEMM growth was not associated with a decrease in the percentage of mixed colonies containing megakaryocytic cells as assessed by use of the MoAb C17.28 against platelet glycoprotein IIIa. Removal of adherent cells and T lymphocytes from the target bone marrow cells had no influence on the suppressive effect of rIFN-alpha, whereas it significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of rIFN-gamma on the growth of megakaryocytic colonies and the other hematopoietic progenitors. The data indicate that (1) human megakaryocytopoiesis is markedly inhibited by rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma, and (2) the inhibitory effect of rIFN-alpha is due to a direct action on hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas the effect of rIFN-gamma is mediated to a significant degree through accessory cell populations.\r"

Four cases also had translocations involving 14q11. Trisomy or multisomy for 8q resulting from an i(8q) or from rearrangements with 8p12 as the breakpoint was observed in nine cases, and a deletion of 6q was found in four cases. Trisomy or partial trisomy for 7q was observed in four cases, of which two had abnormalities of band 7q35 to which the TCR beta chain gene is mapped. The expression of Tac antigen, investigated in 27 cases of human T cell leukemia virus I-negative chronic T cell leukemia, which included the 15 cases of T-PLL, showed a good correlation with abnormalities of 7q35. Our studies on chronic T leukemias suggest that inv(14)(q11q32) and trisomy for 8q are abnormalities characteristic of T-PLL.\r"

  ".W": "A novel pre-B cell component in direct and cultured myeloma bone marrow material has been delineated by using immunochemistry and flow cytometry techniques. Our phenotypic studies suggest a novel hybrid expression of pre-B and plasma cell antigens with coexpression of cytoplasmic mu, common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and plasma cell antigens (PCA-1 and PC-1). This suggests that myeloma pre-B-like cells are aberrant malignant cells and not normal pre-B lymphocytic counterparts. With the advantage of a pure and stable source of these cells from M3 culture to allow molecular characterization, we performed one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that the cytoplasmic mu in myeloma pre-B-like cells has a molecular weight of 74,000 daltons and an isoelectric point of 6.3 and that it is strikingly homogeneous and discrete in size and charge compared with standard secretory mu, which suggests an aberrant, mutant, or monoclonal form of mu. Monoclonality was further evidenced by heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangements demonstrated with JH and C kappa probes. We also established that this novel myeloma pre-B component is a major proliferative element as determined by double-labeling experiments with phenotype coupled to labeling/proliferative indexes. Our stimulatory studies indicate some capacity of these cells to mature on exposure to phorbol esters. These myeloma pre-B cells may represent the stem cell or self-renewal component in myeloma. Our establishment of these cells in long-term culture offers a considerable asset in studying the immature cells, which may be critical to the immortalization of myeloma.\r"

Although IFN-gamma is a structurally distinct molecule, this agent suppresses in vitro hematopoietic progenitor cells in a fashion similar to that of IFN-alpha. Therefore, we initiated a study of rIFN-gamma at doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/m2/d intramuscularly in patients with Ph-positive benign-phase CML. Twenty-six of 30 patients entered in the study were evaluable. Six patients have achieved a complete hematologic response; four, a partial hematologic response. The median follow-up period of patients who are in complete remission is 7.5 months (range, 5 to 12 months). No relapses have occurred among the complete responders. So far, five patients have had cytogenetic improvement with emergence of 5% to 45% diploid cells in the bone marrow. Fever and flulike symptoms were the most common side effects, with partial tolerance often developing after about 1 week. The majority of patients tolerated therapy with minimal change in performance status. In conclusion, rIFN-gamma has demonstrated clinical activity in CML. On the basis of these observations and the in vitro synergistic growth-inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, we have started trials of combination IFN therapy in CML patients.\r"

Two-color fluorescence studies showed that 80% of the My9+ cells expressed the B4 antigen and 63% of the B4+ cells were IL2-R+. Cell incubation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) increased the expression of B4 antigen and significantly decreased the proportion of My9+ and IL2-R-bearing cells. Southern analysis of DNA from leukemic cells revealed monoclonal rearranged heavy and k light-chain immunoglobulin genes. Immunoprecipitation of leukemic cell membrane proteins with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the IL2-R (anti-Tac) revealed a protein with the same molecular weight (55 kilodaltons) as that of the IL2-R present on PHA-stimulated normal T cells. Fresh leukemic cells did not express high-affinity IL2-R and did not proliferate in liquid culture or in a colony assay in the presence of recombinant IL2 (rIL2). PMA-treated blast cells, however, generated B cell colonies in the presence of rIL2, thus suggesting that PMA could induce functional IL2-R on immature leukemic B cells.\r"

Significant PMN migration occurred across polycarbonate filters after stimulation with rHuTNF-alpha at concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-10) mol/L and at 10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/L for rHuTNF-beta and N-formylmethionyl-leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP), whereas recombinant human interferon-gamma was only minimally active at 10(-7) mol/L and recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha was inactive at the doses tested. In addition, antibodies to rHuTNF-alpha completely inhibited rHuTNF-alpha but not rHuTNF-beta or FMLP-induced PMN migration. Combinations of rHuTNF-alpha and rHuTNF-beta (at similar molar concentrations) stimulated PMN migration levels comparable to that obtained with rHuTNF-alpha alone. Checkerboard analyses performed by placing different concentrations of rHuTNF-alpha and rHuTNF-beta above and below polycarbonate filters of microchemotaxis chambers demonstrated that rHuTNF-alpha and rHuTNF-beta stimulated both chemotactic and chemokinetic responses by PMN. Additional studies demonstrated that 1 X 10(-8) mol/L rHuTNF-alpha and 3 X 10(-9) mol/L rHuTNF-beta (which represents 10(4) U/mL of each cytokine) were similar in their ability to induce superoxide production by PMNs; however, at ten- to 100-fold lower molar concentrations (10(3) and 10(2) units), rHuTNF-alpha was significantly more active than rHuTNF-beta. At the doses tested, both cytokines were less active than phorbol myristate acetate at stimulating O2- release. The results demonstrate that rHuTNF-alpha and rHuTNF-beta differ quantitatively but not qualitatively in their effects on PMN functions in vitro and suggest that rHuTNF-beta may be less toxic than rHuTNF-alpha in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Human myeloid leukemia cells respond to various signals by differentiating to more mature cells. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a mononuclear phagocyte-derived factor, tumor necrosis factor/cachectin (TNF), on the proliferation and differentiation of the human cell lines HL-60 (promyelocytic) and U937 (monoblastic), and to characterize TNF receptors on these cells. TNF had no effect on HL-60 cell growth or thymidine incorporation, but it markedly inhibited that of U937 cells. HL-60 cells treated with TNF formed osteoclast-like polykaryons and developed nonspecific esterase positivity. In a dose-dependent fashion, TNF enhanced HL-60 cell nonspecific esterase activity, H2O2 production, NBT reduction, and acid phosphatase content. Together, TNF and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) additively and synergistically caused increases in these activities as well as the expression of HLA-DR and the monocyte antigens LeuM3 (CDw14) and OKM1 (CD11). TNF also synergistically enhanced the differentiating effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The potentiating actions of D3 of IFN-gamma on the TNF effect were maximal when the two agents were present together throughout the incubation, and pretreatment with TNF augmented the subsequent response to D3, but not IFN-gamma. HL-60 and U937 cells bound 125I-labeled TNF specifically, rapidly, and reversibly with binding constants of 227 and 333 pmol/L and receptors per cell of 4,435 and 6,806 for HL-60 and U937, respectively. Scatchard plots were linear, which suggested single classes of receptors. HL-60 TNF receptors were not changed by a three-day treatment with IFN-gamma or D3. U937 and HL-60 cells internalized and degraded 125I-labeled TNF to comparable degrees. TNF has differing effects on HL-60 and U937 cells that are apparently mediated through comparable high-affinity TNF receptors. The unique responses of different cell types to TNF may be due to postreceptor factors.\r"

  ".W": "The haemodynamic responses to intravenous insulin (0.15 units/kg) were measured in five patients with chronic autonomic failure who were not receiving drug treatment. After the administration of insulin supine blood pressure fell steadily, with a substantial reduction even before the onset of hypoglycaemia. None of the patients showed the usual range of neuroglycopenic symptoms, but they all became drowsy, with increasing sedation as the blood glucose concentration fell. In four other patients with autonomic dysfunction intravenous injection of 25-50 ml of 50% glucose alone caused a striking, although transient, fall in blood pressure. Hypoglycaemia was reversed by a 10 minute intravenous infusion of 100 ml of 25% glucose; this did not lower blood pressure further and rapidly restored previous levels of alertness. Consideration must be given to the hypotensive potential of insulin in patients with autonomic failure during an insulin stress test. The inability of these patients to show the usual manifestations of hypoglycaemia, plus the short lived, though pronounced, reduction in blood pressure after intravenous administration of 50% glucose, may further increase the risks of this procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Chest radiographs and spirometric tests were performed on 81 patients who had silicosis from two granite quarries in 1975, 73 of whom were followed up for two to 10 (mean 7.2) years. Each patient's initial and most recent chest radiographs were assessed independently by three experienced readers, and the yearly declines in forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity were estimated from two to four (mean 3.45) serial spirometric readings. Estimates of individual dust exposure were based on extensive historical data on hygiene. All but 11 patients were no longer exposed to dust by the start of follow up, but 24 (45%) of 53 patients who had simple silicosis and 11 (55%) of 20 who had the complicated disease showed radiological evidence of disease progression. In patients who had simple silicosis and showed no radiological progression the yearly declines in forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity were modest (64 ml/year and 59 ml/year, respectively), whereas significantly greater declines in lung function were seen in those who showed radiological evidence of progression (97 ml/year and 95 ml/year, respectively). In addition to radiological progression the previous average dust concentration to which patients had been exposed also influenced declines in both forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity after allowing for the effects of age, smoking, duration of exposure, history of tuberculosis, initial state of disease, and baseline lung function. The probability of radiological progression was most strongly influenced by the average dust concentration previously exposed to. The progression of simple silicosis is thus accompanied by appreciable declines in lung function and is strongly affected by previous levels of exposure to dust.\r"

Detailed case reports were therefore analysed to identify characteristic features associated with acquisition of the infection. Of the 175 cases, 96 (55%) were diagnosed in foreign workers or their families, 47 (27%) in nationals travelling on holiday or business, 11 (6%) in immigrants, and 21 (12%) either in contacts who had not travelled or in unclassified groups. Poliomyelitis principally affected children under 5, but travellers aged 41-65 had the highest case fatality rate. The main serotype isolated was poliovirus type 1. The findings suggest that though fewer than one in every 100,000 travellers may be infected by poliomyelitis, all travellers and all immigrants, refugees, and foreign workers should be given full protection against all three polioviruses by routine vaccination.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating antibodies to poliovirus were estimated in a group of 300 British and 84 foreign first year students who registered at the health centre of Nottingham University in 1984. Detectable antibodies to all three poliovirus serotypes were found in 212 (71%) of the British students but in only 47 (56%) of those from abroad. Most of the British students (280; 93%) had been born in 1965 or 1966, when uptake of poliomyelitis vaccine was declining. Immunisation histories showed that 10 British and 29 foreign students (3% and 35%) had no record of any immunisation; only five British and two foreign students, however, were negative for all three poliovirus serotypes. These findings provide evidence that a high proportion of British born people aged 18-29 have adequate circulating poliovirus antibodies despite incomplete immunisation schedules. Though this is reassuring, the absence of antibodies in some students and the lack of previous immunisation against poliomyelitis in 39 suggest that reinforcing doses of vaccine at the time of leaving school or beginning further education are still warranted, particularly for students from other countries. The findings also emphasise the need for accurate immunisation records.\r"

It was more common in Bruton's disease (15 (22%) of 69 patients) than in other forms of immunodeficiency (15 (7%) of 212 patients). Non-septic arthritis was more prevalent than septic arthritis, particularly monoarticular arthritis in Bruton's disease and pauciarticular disease in common variable immunodeficiency. Boys in whom a diagnosis of Bruton's disease was delayed were likely to develop recurrent infections complicated by arthritis. The measurement of serum immunoglobulin concentrations readily differentiates immunodeficiency from conditions such as Still's disease and dictates subsequent management.\r"

Patient complaints, diagnostic hypotheses, observer and record variations, and patients' and doctors' opinions were analysed for each record, and records were compared with the final diagnosis. About 40% of the data in the patient record were not present in the medical record. Two thirds of the patients said that they could express all or most of their complaints in the patient record. The doctors found that the medical record expressed the main complaints better (52%) than the patient record (15%) but that diagnostic hypotheses were more certain in the patient record (38%) than in the medical one (26%). The number of diagnostic hypotheses in the patient record was about 20% higher than that in the medical record. Intraobserver agreement (51%) was better than interobserver agreement (32%), while the inter-record agreement varied from 25% (between the medical and patient records) to 35% (between the transcribed and patient records). One third of final diagnoses were seen in the medical record, with 29% and 22% for the transcribed and patient records, respectively. Interobserver agreement in the final diagnosis was 35%. The results of the study suggest that computerised history taking is suitable for certain patients in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the oral interview with a doctor.\r"

This increase followed a media campaign that emphasised the potential heterosexual spread of HIV. After pretest counselling roughly one quarter of the women and of the heterosexual men decided not to be tested. The reason given most often by women for testing was previous sexual intercourse with bisexual or possibly bisexual men. Heterosexual men were most often concerned about previous casual encounters or contact with prostitutes. Of the 641 tests for HIV antibody performed during the last three months of 1986, 37 (5-8%) were positive. Because an increasing number of patients are attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics for HIV antibody testing staffing levels in these clinics need to be reappraised now.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical test of intestinal calcium absorption has been developed using non-radioactive stable strontium as a calcium tracer. In nine elderly subjects there was a close correlation between the fractional absorption of strontium and radioactive calcium (45Ca) during a five hour period after the simultaneous oral administration of the two tracers. Comparable precision was achieved with each tracer in six subjects in whom the test was repeated after two weeks. The effect of food on strontium absorption was examined in a further 33 normal subjects (age 21-60 years), and the administration of the strontium with a standard breakfast was shown to reduce the variance at individual time points. A simplified test in which serum strontium concentration was measured four hours after the oral dose given with a standard breakfast was adopted as the routine procedure. The normal range (mean (2 SD], established over 97 tests in 53 patients, was 7.0-18.0% of the dose in the extracellular fluid. A further 30 patients with possible disorders of calcium absorption (10 with primary hyperparathyroidism and 20 with coeliac disease) were studied by this standard test. In both groups of patients the mean four hour strontium values were significantly different from normal. This standard strontium absorption test allows assessment of calcium absorption with sufficient sensitivity and precision to have a wide application in clinical practice.\r"

Of 95 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease, 55 (58%) had gall stones or had had a cholecystectomy. Gall stones were present in four out of 24 (17%) patients with haemoglobin S + C disease and two out of 12 (17%) with haemoglobin S beta thalassaemia. The presence of gall stones was not related to sex, geographical origin, or haematological variables and was not associated with abnormal results of liver function tests. Symptoms typical of biliary colic were reported by 32 out of 47 adult patients with gall stones, and cholecystitis or cholestasis was diagnosed in 18. Cholecystectomy was performed in 29 patients with good relief of symptoms in most cases. Postoperative complications were common, occurring in 10 of the 28 patients who could be evaluated, but not generally serious; they were considerably lessened by a preoperative exchange transfusion that reduced the haemoglobin S concentration to below 40%. It is suggested that all patients with sickle cell disease should be screened for gall stones and that elective cholecystectomy should be performed in those with symptoms or complications.\r"

A total of 217 (24.5%) of the graduates in these senior academic positions had graduated from Oxford or Cambridge and 137 (15.5%) had an intercalated BSc. The corresponding figures for a control group matched for sex and date of graduation were 118 (13.3%) for Oxford and Cambridge (academic to control odds ratio 2.11:1) and 34 (3.8%) for the BSc (odds ratio 4.58:1). Those with an intercalated BSc in the clinical specialties raised substantially more research grants from the Medical Research Council than their peers from Oxford and Cambridge or those without a BSc. The Oxford and Cambridge group raised more grants in the non-clinical specialties. Bibliometric analysis was carried out on the United Kingdom graduates within the broad specialty of medicine (n = 218) matched for date of graduation. Academics with a BSc had a better publication record over 10 years (median number of original publications 72) than the Oxford and Cambridge group (median 59) and a substantially better record than those from other schools without a BSc (median 46). Citation analysis was carried out on subsets of the above sample matched for date of graduation and frequency of publication. Those with an intercalated BSc were cited more often (8.04 citations/paper) than the Oxford and Cambridge graduates (7.63) and substantially more than their peers without a BSc (4.16). These data show very clearly that research training or experience, or both, as an undergraduate has a substantial influence on career development and correlates positively with subsequent research performance many years later.\r"

On average they had missed seven school days in the past year. The opinions of the parents about treatment appeared to be determined by the severity of the child's asthma. Most schools coped well with giving bronchodilators, though there was no real understanding of the nature of the disease or treatment. Most children who had received pressurised inhalers could not use them satisfactorily.\r"

As few babies were born before term (n = 14) or with a low birth weight (n = 14) further analyses were conducted to investigate predictors of absolute birth weight and gestational age. Low income was found to be an independent predictor of birth weight when birth weight was treated both as a dichotomous and as a continuous variable. Unemployment was found to be associated with absolute birth weight. Although this effect was statistically accounted for by low income, a low income was frequently caused by unemployment. Smoking independently predicted absolute birth weight and tended to be associated with preterm delivery. None of the factors investigated was associated with gestational age. In contrast with previous findings, factors such as social class, adverse life events, and psychiatric state were not associated with birth outcome. The mechanism underlying the association between low income and low birth weight requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "To identify factors that may predict the development of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS related symptoms various immunological measurements were studied in a group of homosexual men attending screening clinics for AIDS in Copenhagen. Fifty seven men whose ratio of T helper lymphocytes to T suppressor lymphocytes (CD4:CD8 ratio) was less than 1.0 before the study began were included. Forty two were positive for antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), of whom 38 were reinvestigated after a median observation period of 10 months. Among the seropositive men the transformation responses to pokeweed mitogen and cytomegalovirus and the absolute count of CD4 positive lymphocytes were the most common abnormal values. In particular, a low relative response to pokeweed mitogen on initial investigation correlated with a worsened clinical condition on reinvestigation. The risk of a worsened clinical condition was 55 times higher in seropositive men whose responses to pokeweed mitogen were low than in other seropositive men. The corresponding relative risks for low transformation responses to cytomegalovirus and for a decreased absolute count of CD4 positive lymphocytes were 18 and six. The relative response to pokeweed mitogen is therefore a very sensitive short term predictive marker of the clinical condition of seropositive patients who have a CD4:CD8 ratio of less than 1.0.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of the relation between scores on the six subscales of the Crown-Crisp experiential index and subsequent incidence of ischaemic heart disease was undertaken among participants in the Northwick Park heart study. Results from 1457 white men aged 40-64 at recruitment showed that phobic anxiety was strongly related to subsequent major ischaemic heart disease (fatal and non-fatal events combined) when other associated variables were taken into account. The phobic anxiety score alone remained significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease when scores on all the subscales were included in the analysis. Phobic anxiety seemed to be particularly associated with fatal ischaemic heart disease but was not associated with deaths from other causes and was no higher in those with a pre-existing myocardial infarction at recruitment than in those without. There was a consistent increase in risk of fatal ischaemic heart disease with score on the phobic anxiety subscale. The relative risk for those whose score was 5 and above was 3.77 (95% confidence interval 1.64 to 8.64) compared with those whose score was 0 or 1. The 49 participants with evidence of myocardial infarction at recruitment had higher scores on the subscales for free floating anxiety and functional somatic complaint. The Crown-Crisp experiential index is simple to fill out and acceptable to patients. When the results are combined with other known risk factors it may be of use in defining high risk subjects and in planning strategies for prevention.\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective analysis of 2870 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix treated by radiotherapy from 1971 to 1978 showed that the prognosis for younger patients (defined as either under 35 or under 40) was better than that for older age groups, but young patients presented with earlier disease. When the effect of stage on prognosis was also considered the improved survival of patients under 35 was confirmed, although the result was of only borderline significance. The better survival of younger patients was particularly noticeable for stage IB disease, the corrected five year survival of those under 35 being 93% compared with 79% for those over 35. On the basis of this analysis and a review of previous reports it is concluded that age alone is a poor indicator of prognosis and should not be used as an indication for adjuvant treatment. There is no evidence in this series of an aggressive form of cervical carcinoma in younger patients during the 1970s.\r"

In six healthy men who walked 37 km on four consecutive days faecal haemoglobin content remained normal (reference range 0.10-2.53 mg/g faeces) with no significant differences between values. In 28 marathon runners who refrained from taking drugs or food containing blood the median faecal haemoglobin content increased by 0.42 mg/g faeces (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.83 mg/g) from 1.06 (0.86 to 1.31) mg/g before the race. In 13 runners who had taken drugs before the race the corresponding increase in the median faecal haemoglobin content was 0.87 (-0.03 to 2.20) mg/g from the value before the race of 0.93 (0.46 to 1.55) mg/g. Prolonged walking had no effect on gastrointestinal blood loss. Intense endurance exercise in the form of marathon running induced a significant but clinically unimportant increase. This may be exaggerated by the ingestion of drugs and assume importance in causing iron deficiency and sports anaemia. The use of drugs, particularly analgesics, by marathon runners should be actively discouraged.\r"

An overall mortality of 8.9 per 10,000 a day was recorded during February 1985, and in children under 5 years of age the rate was 22 per 10,000 a day. The estimated prevalence of malnutrition (calculated as less than 80% of the reference weight for height) ranged from 32% to 52% among children of preschool age. The principal causes of morbidity and mortality were measles, diarrhoea and dysentery, respiratory infections, and malaria. The findings suggest that malnutrition and disease increased in these refugees after they arrived in the camps. Epidemiological assessment is essential to help to maintain the health and nutrition of refugees in emergency camps.\r"
