  ".W": "The human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is essential for high-level expression of human epsilon-, gamma-, and beta-globin genes. Developmentally stable DNase I hypersensitive sites (designated HS) mark sequences within this region that are important for LCR activity. A 1.9-kilobase (kb) fragment containing the 5' HS 2 site enhances human beta-globin gene expression 100-fold in transgenic mice and also confers position-independent expression. To further define important sequences within this region, deletion mutations of the 1.9-kb fragment were introduced upstream of the human beta-globin gene, and the constructs were tested for activity in transgenic mice. Although enhancer activity was gradually lost with deletions of both 5' and 3' sequences, a 373-base-pair (bp) fragment retained the ability to confer relative position-independent expression. Three prominent DNase I footprints were observed in this region with extracts from the human erythroleukemia cell line K-562, one of which contained duplicated binding sites for transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein 1). When the 1.9-kb fragment containing an 18-bp deletion of the AP-1 binding sites was tested in transgenic mice, enhancer activity decreased 20-fold but position-independent expression was retained.\r"

  ".W": "The glnHPQ operon of Escherichia coli encodes components of the high-affinity glutamine transport system. One of the two promoters of this operon, glnHp2, is responsible for expression of the operon under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The general nitrogen regulatory protein (NRI) binds to two overlapping sites centered at -109 and -122 from the transcription start site and, when phosphorylated, activates transcription of glnHp2 by catalyzing isomerization of the closed sigma 54-RNA polymerase promoter complex to an open complex. The DNA-bending protein integration host factor (IHF) binds to a site immediately upstream of glnHp2 and enhances the activation of open complex formation by NRI phosphate. The NRI-binding sites can be moved several hundred base pairs further upstream without altering the ability of NRI phosphate to activate open complex formation. We propose that the IHF-induced bend can facilitate or obstruct the interaction between NRI phosphate and the closed complex depending on the relative positions of NRI phosphate and sigma 54-RNA polymerase on the DNA.\r"

The encoded protein is 64% identical to the yeast and mammalian counterparts and shows all the prominent structural features known from these organisms. Antibody raised against a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide with crossreactivity against p34 proteins recognized a 34-kilodalton protein in extracts of alfalfa cells. When transferred into a fission yeast, the plant cdc2 homolog can complement a temperature-sensitive cdc2 mutant. Northern analysis revealed higher transcript levels in shoots and suspension cultures than in roots. In addition to the dominant transcript of 1.4 kilobases detected in the poly(A)+fraction, 2.5- and 1.2-kilobase transcripts were detected in total RNA preparations from shoots or somatic embryos. Suspension cultures that were induced to form somatic embryos by an auxin (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) showed fluctuations in transcription pattern during the induction period and embryogenesis.\r"

The expression of these three lipoproteins, TagA, AcfD, and TcpC, was controlled by ToxR, the cholera toxin transcriptional activator. The involvement of other bacterial lipoproteins in conferring resistance to the bactericidal effects of complement prompted us to examine this possibility in V. cholerae. Remarkably, mutations in toxR and tcp genes (including tcpC), involved in the biogenesis of the toxin coregulated pili, rendered V. cholerae about 10(4)-10(6) times more sensitive to the vibriocidal activity of antibody and complement. Since V. cholerae is a noninvasive organism and toxR and tcp mutants are highly defective in intestinal colonization in animals and humans, these results raise the possibility that resistance to a gut-associated, \"complement-like\" bactericidal activity may be a major virulence determinant of V. cholerae and other enterobacterial species.\r"

  ".U": "91156665\r", 
  ".W": "The temporal disappearance of natural antioxidants associated with human low density lipoprotein (LDL) in relation to the appearance of various classes of lipid hydroperoxides was investigated under three types of oxidizing conditions. Freshly isolated LDL from plasma of healthy subjects was free of detectable amounts of lipid hydroperoxides as measured by HPLC postcolumn chemiluminescence detection. Exposure of such LDL to a mild, constant flux of aqueous peroxyl radicals led to rapid and complete oxidation of ubiquinol-10, followed by slower partial depletion of lycopene, beta-carotene, and alpha-tocopherol. After an initial lag period of complete inhibition of detectable lipid peroxidation, formation of hydroperoxides of cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids was observed. The onset of detectable lipid peroxidation corresponded closely with the completion of ubiquinol-10 consumption. However, small amounts of ascorbate, present as a contaminant in the LDL preparation, rather than ubiquinol-10 itself were responsible for the initial lag period. Thus, complete consumption of ubiquinol-10 was preceded by that of ascorbate, and exposure of ascorbate-free LDL to aqueous peroxyl radicals resulted in immediate formation of detectable amounts of lipid hydroperoxides. The rate of radical-mediated formation of lipid hydroperoxides in ascorbate-free LDL was low as long as ubiquinol-10 was present, but increased rapidly after its consumption, even though more than 80% and 95% of endogenous carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol, respectively, were still present. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when peroxyl radicals were generated within LDL or when the lipoprotein was exposed to oxidants produced by activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. LDL oxidation was reduced significantly by supplementing the lipoprotein preparation with physiological amounts of either ascorbate or ubiquinol-10. Our data show that ubiquinol-10 is much more efficient in inhibiting LDL oxidation than either lycopene, beta-carotene, or alpha-tocopherol.\r"

  ".W": "Intranasal inoculation of type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) produced pneumonia in mice even though the virus did not replicate. To induce the pneumonia, however, a large viral infectious dose was required--i.e., 10(10) plaque-forming units. Four strains of inbred mouse were studied (C57BL/6N, C57BL/10ScN, CBA/N, and C3H/N): all showed similar inflammatory responses, although the greatest infiltration occurred in the C57BL/6N mice. The pathological response to Ad5 infection resembled that previously described in cotton rats: it consisted of overlapping early and late phases, and the infiltration contained primarily lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages with a scattering of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The prominent early phase and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggested that induction of cytokines may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this pneumonia. Assays showed the appearance of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and IL-6 in the infected mouse lungs concomitant with the developing early-phase infiltration. Only IL-6 was found in the peripheral blood. IL-6 reached maximum titers 6-24 hr after infection, whereas maximum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 were attained 2-3 days after infection. Specific RNAs for each of these cytokines were demonstrated in the infected lungs. To test the hypothesis that a cytotoxic T-cell response was responsible for the second phase, which primarily consisted of a perivascular and peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes, Ad5 was used to infect C57BL/10ScN Nu/Nu and parent mice. The nude mice showed a normal early-phase response, but essentially no peribronchial and only minimal perivascular infiltrations occurred.\r"

We compared the substrates phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to those dephosphorylated by the SS analogue RC-160 (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2) and [D-Trp6]LH-RH in cancer cell lines such as MIA PaCa-2 (human pancreatic cancer), HCPC (hamster cheek pouch carcinoma), A-549 (human lung cancer), HT-29 (human colon cancer), and R3230AC (breast cancer). EGF phosphorylated proteins of 170, 65, and 60 kDa and analogues of SS and LH-RH promoted the dephosphorylation of these proteins in MIA PaCa-2 and HCPC cell lines. The EGF receptor is 170 kDa. pp60src (60 kDa) is known to be a substrate for EGF receptor. The LH-RH receptor is also 60 kDa. The effects of RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH were quantitatively different. Examinations of HT-29, A-549, and R3230AC cancer cell lines revealed no phosphorylation by EGF or dephosphorylation by RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH. In addition to the 170-, 65-, and 60-kDa proteins, 35-kDa proteins were also phosphorylated in some cancer cell lines. This work demonstrates that analogues of SS and LH-RH can reverse the effects of EGF biochemically as well as functionally.\r"

Control cell lines had little or no specific binding. The ligand binding in SKLKB82#3 cells was reversible and was inhibited by peptides in the potency rank of neuropeptide gamma greater than neuropeptide K greater than neurokinin A greater than [10-norleucine]neurokinin A-(4-10) greater than substance P much greater than senktide (succinyl-Asp-Phe-MePhe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2). Specific binding was enhanced by Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ and was inhibited by guanine nucleotide analogues. Thus, SKLKB82#3 cells have been transfected with NK2 receptors that have become associated with an endogenous guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In comparison with membranes from the hamster urinary bladder, a tissue enriched in NK2 receptors, NK2 receptor antagonists displayed markedly different potencies, either more or less potent, in inhibiting specific binding in membranes of the transfected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of 125I-NKA binding by nucleotide analogues was markedly different in SKLKB82#3 cells compared with hamster bladder tissue. The different binding profile in the cells is not due to an artefact introduced during cDNA transfection because a similar profile was also observed in bovine stomach membranes. These results may indicate the existence of two distinct NK2 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC; DS19/Sc9) to terminal differentiation by hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) is characterized by a latent period of 10-12 hr before onset of commitment to terminal-cell division and increased transcription of globin genes. MELC variants, derived from this parental cell line, selected for resistance to vincristine (VC), can be induced to differentiate with little or no latent period. This study shows that accelerated HMBA-induced commitment is characteristic of MELC with a low level (2- to 5-fold) of VC resistance in four independently derived cell lines. Both resistance to VC and accelerated differentiation are stable phenotypes for at least 50 passages (approximately 5 months) in the absence of VC. Low-level VC-resistant MELC do not display increased levels of P-glycoprotein or mdr1, mdr2, and mdr3 mRNAs, nor do they exhibit cross-resistance to colchicine or doxorubicin. These cells do show (i) increased level of protein kinase C activity, (ii) reduced accumulation of [3H]VC, and (iii) restoration of VC sensitivity in the presence of verapamil. MELC selected for higher levels of VC resistance (approximately 500-fold) do express high levels of P-glycoprotein and the mdr3 gene. During HMBA-induced differentiation, DS19/Sc9 decrease [3H]VC accumulation, but P-glycoprotein content does not change. A VC-transport-associated protein, also critical for the process of induced differentiation, may be constitutively present in VC-resistant MELC, accounting for their enhanced sensitivity to inducer. This protein accumulates by exposure of VC-sensitive cells to HMBA, contributing to their differentiation and decreased level of VC accumulation.\r"

  ".U": "91156670\r", 
  ".W": "Mammalian high-mobility group I nonhistone protein (HMG-I) is a DNA-binding chromatin protein that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo to be localized to the A + T-rich sequences of DNA. Recently an unusual binding domain peptide, \"the A.T-hook\" motif, that mediates specific interaction of HMG-I with the minor groove of DNA in vitro has been described. Inspection of the A.T-hook region of the binding domain showed that it matches the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase. Here we demonstrate that HMG-I is a substrate for phosphorylation by purified mammalian cdc2 kinase in vitro. The site of phosphorylation by this enzyme is a threonine residue at the amino-terminal end of the principal binding-domain region of the protein. Labeling of mitotically blocked mouse cells with [32P]phosphate demonstrates that this same threonine residue in HMG-I is also preferentially phosphorylated in vivo. Competition binding studies show that cdc2 phosphorylation of a synthetic binding-domain peptide significantly weakens its interaction with A + T-rich DNA in vitro, and a similar weakening of DNA binding has been observed for intact murine HMG-I protein phosphorylated by the kinase in vitro. These findings indicate that cdc2 phosphorylation may significantly alter the DNA-binding properties of the HMG-I proteins. Because many cdc2 substrates are DNA-binding proteins, these results further suggest that alteration of the DNA-binding affinity of a variety of proteins is an important general component of the mechanism by which cdc2 kinase regulates cell cycle progression.\r"

Successful transfection and expression of the gene for human hsp70 were characterized by RNA hybridization analysis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis. When individual cloned cell lines were exposed to 45 degrees C and their thermal survivals were determined by colony-formation assay, we found that the expression of human hsp70 conferred heat resistance to the rat cells.

Three lines of transgenic swine were analyzed, and mouse WAP was detected in milk from all lactating females at concentrations of about 1 g/liter; these levels are similar to those found in mouse milk. Expression of the corresponding RNA was specific to the mammary gland. Our results suggest that the molecular basis of mammary-specific gene expression is conserved between swine and mouse. In addition the WAP gene must share, with other milk protein genes, elements that target gene expression to the mammary gland. Mouse WAP accounted for about 3% of the total milk proteins in transgenic pigs, thus demonstrating that it is possible to produce high levels of a foreign protein in milk of farm animals. that it is possible to produce high levels of a foreign protein in\r"

In this report we have studied the effects of cellular activation on O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, using T lymphocytes as a model system. Results indicate that the apparent levels of O-GlcNAc on many nuclear proteins increases rapidly after lymphocyte activation, returning to control levels after a few hours. In contrast, the apparent levels of O-GlcNAc on a distinct population of cytosolic proteins decreases rapidly after cellular activation and also returns to control levels after a few hours. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that O-GlcNAc is a regulatory modification and suggest that O-GlcNAc modification may play an important role in the early stages of T-lymphocyte activation.\r"

Stability changes arising from identical mutations at these two buried sites are quite different, suggesting that one site is more rigid than the other. Reversals of residues at positions 35 and 47 confirm that their environments are distinct. Mutants containing weakly polar residues at these two sites suggest that the protein interior is more polar than a liquid hydrocarbon. Interactions between residues at the two sites appear to be minimal. These observations are compatible with a view of protein interiors that incorporates properties of liquid hydrocarbons but also includes polar interactions and a site-dependent \"packing energy\" associated with changes in internal structure.\r"

The mass of LCAT secreted, determined by immunoassay, did not differ in the native and mutant species. LCAT specific activity was also unchanged in the mutant species. In particular, the cysteine-free double mutant, in which Cys-31 and Cys-184 had both been replaced, was fully active in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters. This result is not consistent with a catalytic role for LCAT free cysteine residues. The classical inhibitor of LCAT activity, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which strongly (89%) inhibited the native enzyme, had partial (45%) inhibitory activity with mutant enzyme species containing a single -SH residue, while the double mutant was not significantly inhibited by DTNB. These data are interpreted to suggest that Cys-31 and Cys-184 are vicinal both to each other and to the \"interfacial binding site\" at residues 177-182, and that DTNB exerts its effect by steric inhibition.\r"

We show here that cleavage of membrane proTGF-alpha by an elastase-like enzyme constitutes an important regulatory step in the generation of soluble TGF-alpha. Cleavage is activated in response to serum factors and tumor-promoting phorbol esters, leading to depletion of cell surface proTGF-alpha, which disperses as soluble factor. Activation of proTGF-alpha cleavage is mediated by protein kinase C-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The results demonstrate the existence of mechanisms that control the switch of TGF-alpha from a juxtacrine to a paracrine growth factor.\r"

In contrast, the REV ME111 provirus is actively transcribed in a variety of tissues from transgenic chickens, is expressed from transcriptional control elements present in the long terminal repeat of the provirus, and codes for active neomycin phosphotransferase II. The REV vector system as applied to the chicken represents a departure from the long-established paradigm of retroviral transgenes in mice and provides a new approach to the study of avian biology.\r"

The 160-kDa protein, which is a minor serum component, is composed of two different heavy chains of 69 and 74 kDa and a light chain of 29 kDa and resembles known immunoglobulin on the basis of an equimolar ratio of heavy and light chains, N-linked glycosylation of heavy chains, presence of intra- and interchain disulfide bonds, and polydispersity of each peptide chain. High molecular mass (polymeric) as well as low molecular mass (monomeric) forms were isolated from serum. The hagfish immunoglobulin is unique in that each heterodimer is composed of two different heavy chains and two light chains. The partial peptide maps and amino acid compositions of the two heavy chains differ; the chains do not crossreact immunologically. Slight crossreactivity of the 74-kDa heavy chain with antisera against purified shark immunoglobulin and some conservation of amino acid sequences, including those surrounding a cysteine, suggest that the isolated protein is an immunoglobulin.\r"

The sequences of MSA-2 from three isolates revealed a central domain composed of repeats that vary in number, length, and sequence, flanked in turn by nonrepetitive variable sequences and by conserved N- and C-terminal domains. We report here the sequences of a further four MSA-2 alleles, containing repetitive sequences that are related but not identical to each other. The seven alleles of MSA-2 can be divided into two distinct allele families on the basis of nonrepetitive sequences. Hybridization studies with repeat probes indicated that all of the 44 P. falciparum isolates examined contained repeat regions similar to those defined in known MSA-2 sequences.\r"

The puf mRNA segment, encoding the pigment-binding proteins of the reaction center, and the 0.5-kb puc mRNA species, encoding pigment-binding proteins of the light-harvesting LHII antenna complex of Rhodobacter capsulatus were degraded more rapidly under high oxygen tension than under low oxygen tension. Studies on strains having deletions or insertions in the puf operon indicate that rate-limiting endonucleolytic cleavage in the reaction center coding region of the polycistronic puf mRNA was influenced by growth conditions. However, other mRNA segments, for which exonucleolytic degradation was postulated to be rate-limiting, decayed with the same rate under either high or low oxygen tension. Likewise, the degradation of the puhA mRNA, the cycA mRNA, and the cytfbc mRNA was found to be independent of the oxygen tension in the culture. The data strongly suggest that specific mRNA sequences or structures are responsible for the observed oxygen effect on mRNA stability.\r"

Binding sites for the NF-kappa B complex are found in the enhancer regions of a number of genes, including the immunoglobulin kappa gene and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. In this communication we identify an activity from avian reticuloendotheliosis virus T-transformed avian lymphoid cells that binds in an electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay to an NF-kappa B binding site from the kappa enhancer. This activity contains proteins immunologically related to rel, as detected by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against v-rel. In a DNA affinity precipitation assay using the NF-kappa B site from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, v-rel and several other proteins were identified. These data suggest that oncogenic transformation by v-rel is the result of an altered pattern of gene expression.\r"

The Ts16 cultures exhibited fewer ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, which were smaller and emitted shorter, smoother, and more simplified neurites than those from euploid littermates. Whereas the addition of beta-nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) augmented the specific activity of ChAT and neuritic extension for both Ts16 and euploid cholinergic neurons, only Ts16 cultures exhibited an increase in the number and size of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons.

Major differences among RK1 to RK4 exist in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions and in amino acids representing potential extracellular sequence between the S1 and S2 hydrophobic domains. RK5 encodes a unique channel of 490 amino acids having six hydrophobic domains but only five basic residues in the putative voltage-sensing domain. Unlike RK1 to RK4, RK5 is a rat homologue of the Drosophila Shal family of K+ channels, which have not been previously described in mammals. Although RK5 mRNA is present in cardiac atrium and ventricle, it is most abundant in brain. RK1, RK2, and RK3 transcripts are predominantly found in brain but are present also at lower levels in other tissues, such as heart and aorta. RK2 is absent from skeletal muscle whereas RK1 and RK3 are present in this tissue. RK4 mRNA is ubiquitous in electrically excitable tissue, being present at comparable levels in atrium, ventricle, aorta, brain, and skeletal muscle.

At frog junctions, the addition of 1 microM okadaic acid to the extracellular fluid caused almost a doubling of the amplitude of the end-plate potential. The effect of okadaic acid was reversible. Quantal analysis showed that the augmenting effect was presynaptic, resulting from an increase in the number of quanta of transmitter released by a nerve impulse. Where was no significant change in the amplitude of spontaneously liberated miniature end-plate potentials, but their frequency of release increased in parallel with the increase in amplitude of the nerve-evoked synaptic potential. Similar studies with lobster neuromuscular junctions showed increases in the size of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses that were similar in magnitude to the effects seen in the frog junctions. No significant changes in membrane potential or in input resistance accompanied the increased response size. These results suggest that transmitter release at a variety of junctions using different transmitters is constantly modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of important protein components within nerve terminals.\r"

After 24 hr of treatment with tunicamycin AcCho still elicited currents, but their size was significantly reduced and their decay was greatly accelerated. The binding of 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin, a specific and irreversible antagonist of muscle AcCho receptors, was greatly reduced after tunicamycin treatment, and an equivalent reduction was observed after a long-lasting application of the AcCho agonist carbachol. We suggest that, after inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin, AcCho receptors are expressed correctly on the plasma membrane but these receptors desensitize more rapidly and are less efficient in binding alpha-bungarotoxin.\r"

In its helix-loop-helix region HLH462 is closely related to the Id protein and the Drosophila emc protein. Like Id, HLH462 lacks a basic region required for DNA binding, and it inhibits the DNA-binding activities of other helix-loop-helix proteins. On the basis of its structural and functional similarity to Id, we suggest that HLH462 may inhibit the activities of helix-loop-helix transcription factors during the cellular growth response and during development.\r"

  ".W": "Two genes for prepro glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase (1,3-beta-glucanase; 1,3-beta-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.39) of tobacco were cloned and their sequences were compared with cDNA clones. Southern analysis indicates that the genomic clones represent genes derived from ancestral parents of tobacco similar to the present day species Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis, whereas the genes represented by two of the cDNA clones appear to be unique to tobacco. The coding sequences of the genomic clones and cDNA clones differed at less than 2.2% of the positions, indicating that the tobacco 1,3-beta-glucanase gene family is highly conserved. Alternating blocks of sequence in the cDNA clones were identical to the coding sequence of the two genomic clones. These results and an analysis of evolutionary distances for nucleotide substitution are consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of the tobacco 1,3-beta-glucanase gene family has involved exchange of DNA between members of the tomentosiformis and sylvestris subgenomes by recombination or gene conversion.\r"

  ".U": "91156700\r", 
  ".W": "A primer-directed cDNA library was used to obtain cDNA clones corresponding to the 5' end (i.e., the ligand-binding domain) of the avian c-erbB gene. Bacterial c-erbB fusion proteins were synthesized and used to obtain polyclonal antisera specific for the ligand-binding domain of the avian receptor. These antisera and antisera specific for the carboxyl terminal domain of the chicken c-erbB gene product have been used to study the native protein products of the c-erbB locus in primary cell cultures by in vivo labeling and immunoprecipitation. Our studies reveal that three c-erbB gene products of Mr 300,000, Mr 170,000, and Mr 95,000 are synthesized in uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts. Only the Mr 300,000 and Mr 170,000 species can be precipitated by using antisera specific for the cytoplasmic domain of the c-erbB product. The 95,000 species is not recognized by the antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of c-erbB and is specifically released into the culture medium. Northern transfer studies reveal a lower molecular weight transcript of approximately 2.6 kilobases that selectively hybridizes to the ligand-binding domain of the avian c-erbB gene product but does not hybridize with probes specific for the cytoplasmic kinase domain of c-erbB. An additional cDNA clone corresponding to this transcript has been isolated, and its sequence suggests it may arise via alternative processing. Together, these data suggest that a truncated form of this growth factor receptor--i.e., a Mr 95,000 species--is synthesized from a low molecular weight c-erbB transcript that exclusively encodes the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. Secretion of truncated growth factor receptors has been reported recently in several systems, and our results are discussed in the light of these findings.\r"

The variations occurred most often in steps correlating with those classically defined for B-cell differentiation. Seventeen spots were not detectable in at least one of the stages (qualitative variations) and could represent switching on or off of genes coding for nuclear proteins. Detailed analysis of the 55 variable spots showed that they fall into small sets characterized by similar expression profiles, which argues for a combinatorial, multistep control mechanism of gene expression. In addition, analysis of the expression of all the nuclear proteins resolved on the gels clearly differentiated B-lineage cells from myeloid cells and suggested that the most important transition in B-cell differentiation occurs between the resting B cell and plasmocyte stages.\r"

  ".W": "A procedure has been described for microdissection and microcloning of human chromosomal DNA sequences in which universal amplification of the dissected fragments by Mbo I linker adaptor and polymerase chain reaction is used. A very large library comprising 700,000 recombinant plasmid microclones from 30 dissected chromosomes of human chromosome 21 was constructed. Colony hybridization showed that 42% of the clones contained repetitive sequences and 58% contained single or low-copy sequences. The insert sizes generated by complete Mbo I cleavage ranged from 50 to 1100 base pairs with a mean of 416 base pairs. Southern blot analysis of microclones from the library confirmed their human origin and chromosome 21 specificity. Some of these clones have also been regionally mapped to specific sites of chromosome 21 by using a regional mapping panel of cell hybrids. This chromosome microtechnology can generate large numbers of microclones with unique sequences from defined chromosomal regions and can be used for processes such as (i) isolating corresponding yeast artificial chromosome clones with large inserts, (ii) screening various cDNA libraries for isolating expressed sequences, and (iii) constructing region-specific libraries of the entire human genome. The studies described here demonstrate the power of this technology for high-resolution genome analysis and explicate their use in an efficient search for disease-associated genes localized to specific chromosomal regions.\r"

Northern blot analysis indicated a transcript of approximately 4 kilobases, and Southern blot analyses suggested that multiple genes may encode the lectin or closely related proteins in HM-1:IMSS trophozoites. The cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence revealed an N-terminal signal peptide and a mature protein of 1270 amino acids corresponding to a molecular mass of 143 kDa, which comprises a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with potential phosphorylation sites, a transmembrane region, and a large extracellular portion with nine potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. The extracellular portion may be separated into a cysteine-poor domain and a cysteine-rich domain, the latter of which shows in part repetitive structural elements with a low degree of sequence homology to wheat germ agglutinin and to pDd63, a developmentally expressed protein of Dictyostelium discoideum.\r"

This approach was also used to assess the stability of mRNAs in brains that were incubated in oxygenated mammalian Ringer's solution for various lengths of time and from brains that were freshly frozen and then thawed at room temperature. Oocytes injected with mRNA from up to 21-hr postmortem brains gave large agonist- and voltage-activated responses, indicating that mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels are relatively stable in postmortem brain tissue. In contrast, oocytes injected with mRNA from brains incubated in Ringer's solution exhibited smaller responses, and oocytes injected with mRNA from tissue that was frozen and then thawed displayed very small or undetectable responses. Northern blot analysis using a nucleic acid probe for rat brain Na(+)-channel mRNA indicated that the size of the Na+ currents in injected oocytes reflected the levels of mRNA for Na+ channels in the different mRNA preparations. Thus, the expressional potency of mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels is quite stable in postmortem brains in situ, but it is reduced if the brains are kept in oxygenated saline, and freezing and thawing of tissue results in rapid degeneration of mRNA.\r"

Based on the sequences of the cloned receptors, we prepared oligodeoxynucleotide probes to map the cellular expression of the corresponding mRNAs in rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. These mRNAs showed largely overlapping yet distinct patterns of expression. The highest levels of expression for both mRNAs were observed in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. Within the caudate-putamen, 47 +/- 6% and 46 +/- 5% of the medium-sized neurons (10-15 microns) expressed the D1 and D2 mRNAs, respectively, and only the D2 mRNA was observed in the larger neurons (greater than 20 microns). The D1 and D2 mRNAs were expressed in most cortical regions, with the highest levels in the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices. Within neocortex, D1 mRNA was observed primarily in layer 6 and D2 mRNA in layers 4-5. Within the amygdala, D1 mRNA was observed in the intercalated nuclei, and D2 mRNA in the central nucleus. Within the hypothalamus, D1 mRNA was observed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and D2 mRNA in many of the dopaminergic cell groups. Within the septum, globus pallidus, superior and inferior colliculi, mammillary bodies, and substantia nigra only D2 mRNA was detected. These data provide insight into the neuroanatomical basis of the differential effects of drugs that act on D1 or D2 receptors.\r"

This peptide (pAntp) recognized the consensus motif for binding to the promoter region of Hox-1.3. pAntp mechanically introduced into mammalian nerve cells provoked a dramatic morphological differentiation of the neuronal cultures. Moreover, pAntp directly added to already differentiated neuronal cultures penetrated the cells and further augmented their morphological differentiation. Examination of live and fixed neurons in classical and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that pAntp was captured at all regions of the nerve cells and accumulated in the nuclei. In addition, the effect of pAntp on neurite extension was blocked in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus, our results demonstrate that neurons possess an efficient uptake system for the antennapedia homeobox peptide and suggest that binding of pAntp to consensus motifs present in nerve cell nuclei influences neuronal morphogenetic programs.\r"

To investigate the role of gap junctions in the tumor characteristics of these cells, we have used Lipofectin-mediated transfection to introduce a full-length cDNA encoding connexin 43. Several transfected clones were obtained that exhibited various amounts of connexin 43 mRNA transcribed from the inserted cDNA. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed an increase in the amount of connexin 43 immunoreactivity in the transfected cells, being localized at areas of intercellular contact as well as in the cytoplasm. The level of dye coupling was also assessed and found to correlate with the amount of connexin 43 mRNA. When cell proliferation was followed over several days, cells expressing the transfected cDNA grew more slowly than non-transfected cells. These transfected cells will be useful in examining the role of gap junctions in tumorigenesis.\r"

In addition, we clarified the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in expression of the two genes in human skin fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. The various rPDGF isoforms are distinct in their ability to activate transcription of both genes: (i) Both rPDGF-AA and -BB stimulate transcription of the LDL-R gene; in contrast, rPDGF-BB, but not -AA, activates transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. (ii) All recombinant isoforms of PDGF activate transcription of the c-fos gene. (iii) While rPDGF-dependent transcription of the LDL-R gene occurs independently of PKC, transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene appears to involve the action of that enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of kainate (KA)-induced epileptic seizures on the binding properties of hippocampal glutamate receptors, on the modulation of DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/quisqualate receptor by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and on the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied in hippocampal membranes and hippocampal slices. Systemic administration of KA (10 mg/kg; 15 hr survival) produced specific changes in the binding properties of the AMPA/quisqualate receptors and its regulation. Whereas the binding of various ligands to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors was not modified by KA treatment, there was a significant decrease in the maximal number of binding sites for [3H]AMPA. In addition, the increase in [3H]AMPA binding elicited by PLA2 treatment of hippocampal, but not cerebellar, membranes was markedly decreased after KA injection. LTP was also substantially reduced in area CA1 of hippocampal slices from KA-treated animals. The loss of LTP was not due to changes in postsynaptic responses elicited by the bursts that trigger the potentiation effect, thus suggesting that KA treatment disrupts processes that follow N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. Systemic administration of KA was associated with calpain activation as the amount of spectrin breakdown products was increased severalfold in hippocampus but not in cerebellum. Pretreatment of telencephalic membranes with calpain greatly reduced the PLA2-induced increase in [3H]AMPA binding. The results provide evidence in favor of an essential role of PLA2 in the development of LTP and suggest that the order of activation of different calcium-dependent processes is critical for producing the final changes underlying LTP.\r"

Homology analyses reveal that hCyPB is a member of the cyclophilin B (CyPB) family, which includes yeast CyPB, Drosophila nina A, and rat cyclophilin-like protein. This family is distinguished from the cyclophilin A (CyPA) family by the presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-directed signal sequences. hCyPB has a hydrophobic leader sequence not found in hCyPA, and its first 25 amino acids are removed upon expression in Escherichia coli. Moreover, we show that hCyPB is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase which can be inhibited by cyclosporin A. These observations suggest that other members of the CyPB family will have similar enzymatic properties. Sequence comparisons of the CyPB proteins show a central, 165-amino acid peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and cyclosporin A-binding domain, flanked by variable N-terminal and C-terminal domains. These two variable regions may impart compartmental specificity and regulation to this family of cyclophilin proteins containing the conserved core domain. Northern blot analyses show that hCyPB mRNA is expressed in the Jurkat T-cell line, consistent with its possible target role in cyclosporin A-mediated immunosuppression.\r"

All the cell types of skin remain viable and maintain their native architecture for at least 10 days. The culture system is used for toxicity measurements by ascertaining cell viability using two fluorescent dyes: 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester, specific for living cells, and propidium iodide, specific for dead cells. Cell staining with the dyes is measured throughout the tissue block by confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy. The dose-response to three agents--ethanol, doxorubicin, and sodium hypochlorite--is shown and, in the case of sodium hypochlorite, compared to in vivo skin toxicity with a high correlation. We also demonstrate that the end point of [3H]thymidine incorporation measured by histological autoradiography can be used to measure toxicity. Our results with the [3H]thymidine end point demonstrate that the hair follicle cells are the most sensitive to doxorubicin. The native-state model for skin may be an effective replacement for animal systems and superior to the dispersed skin cell systems used previously. It can allow rapid, inexpensive measurements of the effect of manufactured products, drugs, and pollutants on skin.\r"

These effects were prevented by giving glutathione monoethyl ester, which relieved the glutathione deficiency, but such effects were not prevented by giving glutathione, indicating that glutathione is not appreciably taken up by the cerebral cortex. Some of the oxygen used by mitochondria is known to be converted to hydrogen peroxide. We suggest that in glutathione deficiency, hydrogen peroxide accumulates and damages mitochondria. Glutathione, thus, has an essential function in mitochondria under normal physiological conditions. Observations on turnover and utilization of brain glutathione in newborn, preweaning, and adult rats show that (i) some glutathione turns over rapidly (t 1/2, approximately 30 min in adults, approximately 8 min in newborns), (ii) several pools of glutathione probably exist, and (iii) brain utilizes plasma glutathione, probably by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-initiated pathways that account for some, but not all, of the turnover; thus, there is recovery or transport of cysteine moieties. These studies provide an animal model for the human diseases involving glutathione deficiency and are relevant to oxidative phenomena that occur in the newborn.\r"

  ".W": "A mutant of CD4 (CD4.Q421stop), in which the cytoplasmic C-terminal 13 amino acids were truncated, was not expressed on the surface of HeLa cells after transfection but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Seven other truncation mutants of CD4 were expressed well on the cell surface, thus suggesting that the C-terminal amino acids of CD4.Q421stop (-Ser-Glu-Lys-Lys-Thr-Cys) may have the sequence information for ER retention. Further mutational study has revealed that two consecutive lysine residues at the third and fourth positions from the C-terminal end are sufficient for ER retention. Lysine at the fourth position, but not at the third position, from the C terminus can be replaced by arginine without disturbing ER retention. Furthermore, two lysine residues at the third and fifth positions from the C terminus also resulted in ER retention. Thus lysine at the third position and a positively charged amino acid either at the fourth or fifth position from the C terminus are sufficient for ER retention of this CD4 mutant, and possibly all transmembrane proteins. In addition to the requirement of specific amino acids at specific positions, the ER retention signal -Lys-Lys-Xaa-Xaa also requires a transmembrane region for function. By contrast -Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, which targets soluble proteins to the lumen of the ER, does not function in the presence of a transmembrane region.\r"

As a first step toward generating a complete physical and genetic map of the plasmid, a full overlapping collection of cosmids was derived from a total genomic library. Clones were aligned by combining fingerprinting, hybridization, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data. Symbiotic loci were localized by probing a representative set of cosmids with both homologous and heterologous genes. nodABC, nodD1, nodD2, nodSU, nolB, and region II are widely dispersed over pNGR234a, while the two functional copies of nifKDH are separated by only 28 kilobases. Interestingly, sequences homologous to nodE, nodG, nodP, and nodQ have been assigned to another autonomously replicating element in Rhizobium species NGR234. Similarly one copy of the structural dctA gene is located on the symbiotic plasmid (dctA1) while the other is on what we assume to be the chromosome.\r"

Ang II-induced changes in the de novo synthesis of [35S]methionine-labeled secretory proteins were visualized using two-dimensional NaDodSO4/PAGE. Astrocytes from 21-day-old rat brain possess specific high-affinity receptors for Ang II. These cells express two Ang II-induced secretory proteins with Mr 55,000 (AISP-55K) and Mr 30,000 (AISP-30K), which were time- and dose-dependent (EC50, 1 nM). [Sar1, Ile8]Ang II (where Sar is sarcosine) inhibited Ang II-induced secretion of AISP-55K but not AISP-30K. N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicates that AISP-55K is identical to rat plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, whereas AISP-30K exhibits 72-81% identity to three closely related proteins: human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases, a rat phorbol ester-induced protein, and the murine growth-responsive protein 16C8. Immunofluorescent staining with rat plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 antibody was induced in the majority of cells in culture after Ang II treatment of astrocytes from 21-day-old rat brains. Absence of this response to Ang II in astrocytes from neonatal rat brain provides evidence that this action of Ang II on astrocytes is developmentally regulated.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose uptake by adipose tissue is mediated by two glucose transporters: GLUT4, which is most abundant, and GLUT1. While GLUT1 is expressed in many tissues, GLUT4 is unique to tissues that exhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (heart and skeletal muscle and adipose tissue). In the diabetic state and during starvation, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression are decreased in tissue adipocytes. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes in culture, we investigated the possibility that these effects are mediated by elevated cellular cAMP. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 16 hr with forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP, GLUT4 mRNA and protein were decreased by approximately 70%, while expression of GLUT1 mRNA and protein was increased 3-fold. These changes were accompanied by an increased basal rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and a loss of acute responsiveness of hexose uptake to insulin. The magnitude of GLUT4 mRNA depletion/GLUT1 mRNA accumulation was dependent upon the concentration of 8-Br-cAMP. The decrease of GLUT4 mRNA caused by 8-Br-cAMP was the result of a decreased transcription rate, while the half-life of the message was unaffected. The increase in GLUT1 mRNA caused by 8-Br-cAMP was the result of both transient transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization. We suggest that down-regulation of GLUT4 mRNA in adipose tissue in the diabetic state and during starvation is the result of repression of transcription of the GLUT4 gene caused by cAMP.\r"

The vacuoles from the mutants lacking subunits A (72 kDa), B (57 kDa), or c (proteolipid, 16 kDa) were completely inactive in these reactions. Immunological studies revealed that in the absence of each one of those subunits the catalytic sector was not assembled. Labeling with N,N'-[14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide showed the presence of the proteolipid in vacuoles of mutants in which genes encoding subunits of the catalytic sectors were interrupted. No labeling was detected in the mutant in which the gene encoding the proteolipid was interrupted. We conclude that of all the ATPase subunits only the proteolipid is assembled independently and it serves as a template for the assembly of the other subunits. Site-specific mutations were generated in the gene encoding the proteolipid. All of the drastic changes and replacements gave inactive proteins. About half of the single amino acid replacements gave active proteins. Replacing glutamic acid-137 by any of several amino acids, except for aspartic acid, abolished the activity of the enzyme. Other amino acids that may function in proton conductance were changed. It was found that glycine residues may replace amino acids with exchangeable protons.\r"

We tested the ability of long-chain bases to modulate multistage carcinogenesis in mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells exposed to gamma-rays and PMA. Sphingosine and sphinganine completely blocked the enhancement of radiation-induced transformation by PMA (promotion) and partially suppressed transformation by radiation alone. N-Acetylsphingosine, a ceramide analog, did not inhibit transformation. Sphingosine was rapidly taken up by the cells and metabolized; hence, the long-chain bases were added daily to achieve prolonged inhibition. Long-chain bases inhibited protein kinase C activity in C3H/10T1/2 cells and suppressed the down-regulation of this enzyme by PMA. Our results establish that long-chain bases are highly effective inhibitors of carcinogenesis in this model. Our results also indicate that the suppressive effects may be mediated, in part, by inhibition of protein kinase C. The data suggest that sphingosine and other long-chain bases derived from complex sphingolipids may act as cancer-preventative agents.\r"

We have now investigated the effect that induction of wild-type p53 protein in this cell line has on the expression of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen gene. The proliferating-cell nuclear antigen gene encodes a nuclear protein that is an auxiliary factor of DNA polymerase delta and part of the DNA replication machinery of the cell. We show that inhibition of cell cycle progression into S-phase after induction of wild-type p53 protein is accompanied by selective down-regulation of proliferating-cell nuclear antigen mRNA and protein expression.\r"

We used this library to clone the human counterpart of the Sa. cerevisiae CCAAT-binding transcription factor, Hap2, by functional complementation of a hap2 mutation. The cDNA encoding the human Hap2 homolog encodes a protein of 257 amino acids that has a 62-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region 73% identical to the essential core region of Hap2. The amino terminus of the protein is highly enriched in glutamine residues, reminiscent of transcriptional activation domains of several other mammalian transcription factors. Analysis of human Hap2 expression reveals three major transcripts: a 4.1-kilobase species found in all cell types examined, a 7.0-kilobase species specific to B lymphocytes, and a 1.6-kilobase species that is expressed preferentially in HeLa cells and that likely corresponds to our cDNA clone. Thus, the human Hap2 homolog and related factors may play both a constitutive and cell type-specific role in gene expression. The general approach of cloning by complementation should allow the isolation of many human genes for which corresponding yeast mutations exist.\r"

One prediction of this model concerns the structural nature of the pharmacophore in the tumor promotor debromoaplysiatoxin.

It was hypothesized that this multifunctional protein, called glycosylation site-binding protein (GSBP), participated in the process of N-glycosylation of proteins. To test this hypothesis we have employed various conditions to deplete the lumen of GSBP and then assess the level of N-glycosylation catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase). Although most conditions leading to depletion resulted in partial loss of OTase activity, this loss was independent of the extent of GSBP depletion. Indeed, virtually complete loss (greater than 99%) of GSBP with partial retention of OTase activity was frequently observed. Moreover, repletion of the microsomal lumen with GSBP did not restore OTase activity to control levels. Thus, no correlation between GSBP content and OTase activity before or after reconstitution was found. These results suggest that this multifunctional 57-kDa protein is not an essential component of the enzymatic reaction in which oligosaccharide chains are transferred from dolichyl-P-P-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 to nascent polypeptides or to synthetic tripeptide acceptors.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA copy of the RNA gene that encodes the nucleoprotein N of rabies virus Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth strain was cloned into baculovirus. The recombinant baculovirus expressed the N protein abundantly in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. The N protein was extracted from infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells and purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The purified N protein reacted with 31 of 32 monoclonal antibodies that recognize native rabies virus ribonucleoprotein. Like the ribonucleoprotein, the purified N protein was a major antigen capable of inducing virus-specific helper T cells. Priming of mice with the purified N protein prior to a booster inoculation with inactivated Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth virus vaccine resulted in a 20-fold increase in the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. After immunization with the purified N protein, mice developed a strong anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody response and were protected against a lethal challenge of rabies virus. These data indicate that the N protein expressed in insect cells is antigenically and immunogenically comparable to the authentic rabies virus ribonucleoprotein and therefore represents a potential source of an effective and economical vaccine for large-scale immunization of humans and animals against rabies.\r"

  ".U": "91156735\r", 
  ".W": "Anti-tubular basement membrane (alpha TBM) disease is a form of primary interstitial nephritis mediated by autoimmune T cells and alpha TBM antibodies. In mice and humans the nephritogenic immune response is directed to a glycoprotein (3M-1) found along the proximal tubule of the kidney. We have isolated cDNAs from an expression library that encodes for the common framework domain of the 3M-1 antigen. This common domain was once related evolutionarily to a family of intermediate filament-associated proteins. Northern hybridization revealed that all isoforms of 3M-1 range between 1700 and 1900 base pairs and in situ hybridization studies indicate that transcripts are found in tubular epithelium. Candidate peptide fragments were deduced and synthesized from the sequence encoding this common framework domain, and one of the peptide residues was able to bind a monoclonal 3M-1-reactive alpha TBM antibody, stimulate the growth of 3M-1-reactive helper T cells, and induce nephritogenic effector T cells capable of producing interstitial nephritis. Our results indicate that a unique, immunodominant region of the 3M-1 antigen is an informative participant in the emergence of autoimmune injury to certain basement membranes.\r"

  ".W": "A marked decrease in the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit (RI alpha) and an increase in the type II protein kinase regulatory subunit (RII beta) correlate with growth inhibition and differentiation induced in a variety of types of human cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo, by site-selective cAMP analogs. To directly determine whether RI alpha is a growth-inducing protein essential for neoplastic cell growth, human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were exposed to 21-mer RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, and the effects on cell replication and differentiation were examined. The RI alpha antisense oligomer brought about growth inhibition and monocytic differentiation, bypassing the effects of an exogenous cAMP analog. These effects of RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide correlated with a decrease in RI alpha receptor and an increase in RII beta receptor level. The growth inhibition and differentiation were abolished, however, when these cells were exposed simultaneously to both RI alpha and RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide alone has been previously shown to specifically block the differentiation inducible by cAMP analogs. These results provide direct evidence that RI alpha cAMP receptor plays a critical role in neoplastic cell growth and that cAMP receptor isoforms display specific roles in cAMP regulation of cell growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells have been widely thought to be unresponsive to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, a major growth factor released from stimulated platelets at the sites of vascular insults) and devoid of PDGF receptors. Nevertheless, in examining the growth-factor responses of microvascular endothelial cells isolated from human omental adipose tissue, we were surprised to detect PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 180-kDa glycoprotein, subsequently identified as the cellular receptor for PDGF by specific immunoprecipitation. Scatchard analysis of 125I-labeled PDGF binding to human microvascular endothelial cells revealed 30,000 PDGF receptors per cell with a Kd of 0.14 nM. PDGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptors and other cellular proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with half-maximal receptor phosphorylation occurring at 0.3 nM recombinant human PDGF (B chain) and a less than or equal to 1-min exposure to PDGF. Normal cellular consequences of receptor activation were also observed, including tyrosine phosphorylation of a 42-kDa protein and serine phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Furthermore, PDGF was mitogenic for these cells. Microvascular endothelial cells play a central role in neovascularization required for wound healing and solid tumor growth. Thus, the discovery of functional PDGF receptors on human microvascular endothelial cells suggests a direct role for PDGF in this process.\r"

The calculations reproduce the observed charge stabilization effect of a helix in two well-defined test cases: a histidine residue situated at the C-terminal end of a helix in barnase and the sulfate ligand located near the N-terminal end of a helix of the sulfate-binding protein. They also show that the effective dielectric constant for helix-charge interactions is much larger than previously assumed and that the stabilizing effect of the helix is not associated with the helix macrodipole but rather with a few localized dipoles confined mostly to the first turn of the helix. It is predicted that mutations at one end of the helix should have very small effects on the stabilization of charges at the opposite terminus. It is pointed out that the relatively short-ranged effect of the helix is essentially similar to other cases in which localized dipoles play key roles in electrostatic stabilization.\r"

Twenty-eight hearing-impaired subjects were chosen as a sample of convenience from the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and placed into one of three age groups. Ten subjects were in the 4.5 to 6.5-year-old age group, 8 in the 8- to 10-year-old age group, and 10 in the 12.5 to 14.5-year-old age group. Selection criteria included bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of greater than or equal to 65 dB and normal intelligence (IQ greater than or equal to 80). Balance was measured by the use of the Balance subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency. For each age group, a z test was used to compare the subjects' scores with the Balance subtest standard scores. The results showed that for each age group, the mean score for the hearing-impaired children was lower than the standard score. Both older groups had significantly higher scores than the youngest group, but the mean scores of the older groups were not significantly different. No difference between the subjects' balance scores and the Balance subtest standard scores was found among the age groups, suggesting that the balance deficit was not age-related. Gender differences were not found for balance scores.\r"

The physician's referral and communications with other health care personnel were reported to be of limited value as sources of information by most respondents. Overall, both groups responded most positively to the receptive style of data gathering and the systematic style of information processing. Therapists working primarily with neurologically impaired patients responded most positively to the preceptive style of data gathering and the intuitive style of information processing. Therapists working primarily with patients with orthopedic disorders responded most positively to the systematic style of information processing.\r"

All but 4% of the respondents preferred to work with patients who are not likely to have chronic pain. Seventy-two percent believed their entry-level education in pain management and theory was very inadequate or less than adequate to deal with an orthopedic patient population. Pain knowledge scores were low (35.8 out of 46 points), and the scores on positive attitudes toward treating patients with benign chronic pain were lower (20.5 out of 36 points).

Traditional theories of motor development attribute changes in movement to the hierarchical maturation of the central nervous system. The dynamical systems approach emphasizes that movement self-organizes as the result of the interaction of the participating subsystems in developmental and real time. In this article, I discuss, from the theoretical perspective of the dynamical systems approach, the organization of leg movements in low- and high-risk preterm and full-term infants, developmental changes in movement in low-risk preterm infants from 34 weeks' gestational age to 40 weeks' postgestational age, and differences in movement between low-risk preterm infants at 40 weeks' postgestational age and full-term infants. Preliminary data on high-risk preterm infants are presented. Based on these data, the necessity to review and reinterpret traditional concepts of motor development is explored. Suggestions are offered and questions posed on how the dynamical systems perspective may influence the practice of physical therapy in the evaluation, and treatment of infants at risk for movement dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The results from selective dorsal rhizotomy research suggest that therapists need to question some common clinical assumptions about movement dysfunction. The rationale for performing a selective dorsal rhizotomy is based on the clinical assumptions that spasticity is the underlying cause of disordered movement and that reducing or eliminating the spasticity will improve movement. This article reviews the literature related to movement dysfunction, the effects of selective dorsal rhizotomy, and the evidence for disordered motor control in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Selective dorsal rhizotomy appears to reduce spasticity and increase joint range of motion. Abnormal movement patterns, however, persist after the spasticity is reduced. Well-coordinated movement patterns are acquired slowly and appear to be related to an intense period of physical therapy. I argue that these results provide evidence that the presence of spasticity alone is an insufficient explanation for abnormal movement patterns. I propose that physical therapists redirect their efforts from developing methods for reducing spasticity to developing adequate assessment, treatment, and measurement techniques for assessing motor control in children with cerebral palsy. I believe we can maximize the functional potential of children with cerebral palsy by identifying problems related to motor control and applying sound principles of motor learning to treatment.\r"

In 23 patients whose increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (67.4 +/- 10.4 mmHg) and resistance (4.8 +/- 2.4 Wu) were reduced by nitroprusside, orthotopic heart transplantation was performed without early mortality. Right heart catheterization after transplantation revealed a significant and persistent fall of the elevated pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.

These native arteries are excellent conduits when suitable veins are not available. They should also be used on individual indications to replace occluded grafts.\r"

The aortic valve was affected in all patients, and also the mitral valve in five. Pre-existing aortic valve disorder was present in 17 cases (13 congenitally bicuspid 4 rheumatic affection). There were five hospital deaths (20.8%). Staphylococci as causal organism and extensive infection predicted the highest mortality and morbidity. The mean follow-up time was 39.7 (range 2-114) months. Two reoperations because of prosthetic valve dehiscence revealed endocarditis of the implanted valve. Strong correlation was found between favourable postoperative course and rapid normalization of C-reactive protein levels, which did not fall in patients with persistent infection. Early surgery is recommended if the course of bacterial endocarditis is severely complicated.\r"

Withdrawn from the study were 48 patients on dipyridamole and 57 on placebo. Cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events or need for anticoagulant treatment were the reasons for withdrawal in 22 (13%) of the dipyridamole, and 34 (18%) of the placebo group. Logistic regression analysis of risk factors influencing graft patency showed significant relation to peroperatively measured coronary blood flow. A positive trend of treatment was observed (p = 0.08). Vein graft blood flow measured during bypass surgery (245 patients) was significantly greater in the dipyridamole group (p less than 0.01). The occlusion rate was lower in vessels with peroperative blood flow greater than 30 ml/min (vein-marginal p less than 0.01, vein-dexter p less than 0.05, vein-diagonal 0.05 less than p less than 0.1).

In the 355 operations without cardiopulmonary bypass there were nine major and seven minor diagnostic errors (2.5% and 2%). Among the 247 cases with open-heart surgery there were no major and eight (3.2%) minor errors. The malformations most suitable for nonbypass surgery without catheterization seem to be those with reduced pulmonary blood flow requiring systemic-pulmonary artery shunt, aortic coarctation and patent ductus arteriosus. For open-heart surgery without invasive investigation, atrial septal defect, partial atrioventricular canal, aortic and pulmonary stenosis, cardiac tumor and isolated valve disorder are 'classic' candidates. Recent experience indicated that selected cases of complete atrioventricular canal, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and transposition of the great arteries may safely undergo primary repair without cardiac catheterization. Because of its diagnostic potentialities, pediatric cardiac surgeons must become familiar with echocardiography.\r"

With this system 84% of the patients were successfully defibrillated: 12% converted spontaneously. The energy level at conversion was less than or equal to 200 Ws in 90% of the patients. There were no complications associated with the defibrillation procedure. By reducing the need for intrapericardial dissection this method shortens overall operating time and most probably decreases blood loss. The system can also be recommended for operations with a high risk of ventricular arrhythmia prior to pericardiotomy.\r"

CT should be used in preoperative investigation of lung cancer, irrespective of stage. Demonstration of thoracic-wall or mediastinal invasion need not exclude tumour resection. Preoperative mediastinoscopy is indicated if CT shows nodal metastases or if there are signs of tumour invasion, but not in CT-negative T1 or T2 tumour. Abdominal metastases indicated by CT should be investigated with CT-guided needle biopsy.\r"

A 'gentle' reperfusion technique, with gradual rise in perfusate temperature and pressure to physiologic levels over 30 min, was used for 12 hearts following 2-hour or 3 1/2-hour (6 in each group) ischemia. Abrupt reperfusion, with perfusate at 37 degrees C and 70 mmHg, was performed on 13 hearts (6 ischemic for 2 hours and 7 for 3 1/2 hours). Six nonischemic, perfused hearts served as controls. Randomly selected specimens from the left ventricle after 45-60 min reperfusion were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. Volume fractions of myocardial structural components were calculated from stereologic point-counting on the electron micrographs. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that interstitial edema developed with increasing ischemic time and was not influenced by reperfusion technique. The degree of endothelial damage was independent of ischemic time, but was lessened by 'gentle' reperfusion. Both mitochondrial injury and myocyte edema were less when perfusate temperature and pressure were slowly raised after 3 1/2-hour ischemia.\r"

In 11 patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting, arterial blood was sampled before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood was drawn from the coronary sinus concomitantly with arterial blood sampling 5 and 30 min after release of the aortic cross-clamp (n = 10). From a preoperative value of 92 +/- 13 ng/ml, C3a des-Arg rose during CPB to a maximum of 1816 +/- 393 at the end of CPB. Following reperfusion for 5 min, C3a des-Arg was 1284 +/- 232 ng/ml in arterial and 1106 +/- 100 in coronary sinus blood, a significant difference (p less than 0.05). The amount of C3a des-Arg trapped in the heart at 5-min reperfusion showed positive correlation with its arterial concentration (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was found after 30 min of reperfusion. Complement activation products trapped in the heart in the early reperfusion period may play a pathogenetic role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r"

In the placebo group plasma concentrations of C3a were significantly increased on postoperative days 1 and 2, whereas C5a had risen significantly 6 hours after surgery and on days 1 and 2. Methylprednisolone infusion during surgery eliminated the postoperative elevation of C3a and C5a. The postoperative leukocyte count in peripheral blood was higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the controls. The observations indicated that methylprednisolone may reduce the influx of leukocytes from peripheral blood into the airways by attenuating production of biologically active complements.\r"

  ".W": "Vertebrate retinal photoreceptors recover from photoexcitation-induced hydrolysis of guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) by resynthesizing cyclic GMP, which reopens cation channels that have been closed by light. Activation of guanylate cyclase by light-induced depletion of cytosolic calcium is a key event in this recovery process. This cyclase has now been shown to be regulated by a 23-kilodalton calcium binding protein. The protein is present in both rod and cone photoreceptors and was named recoverin because it promotes recovery of the dark state. The amino acid sequence of recoverin exhibits three potential calcium binding sites (EF hands). That recoverin binds calcium was confirmed with calcium-45 and by observing calcium-induced changes in its tryptophan fluorescence. Recoverin activated guanylate cyclase when free calcium was lowered from 450 to 40 nM, an effect that was blocked by an antibody to recoverin. Thus, guanylate cyclase in retinal rods is stimulated during recovery by the calcium-free form of recoverin. A comparison of recoverin with other calcium binding proteins reveals that it may represent, along with the protein visinin, a family of proteins that are regulated by submicromolar calcium concentrations.\r"

The genetically modified RC supports transmembrane charge separation from the photoexcited BChl dimer to the primary quinone through the new BChl molecule, but with a reduced quantum yield of 60 percent (compared to 100 percent in wild-type RCs).

Although the sensor configuration has not been optimized in all respects, data are presented for a model system in which a fluorescein-labeled antibody and Texas Red-labeled immunoglobulin G (IgG) are used.\r"

We found that the specialized muscles of the rostral part of the wing in Microchiroptera and Megachiroptera receive double innervation by both the facial nerve and cervical spinal nerves, suggesting that bats are monophyletic. Innervation by the facial nerve also occurs in Dermoptera and suggests that bats and Dermoptera share a common ancestor that had wings.\r"

A useful probe for the pore of potassium-selective channels is the organic ion tetraethylammonium (TEA), which binds with millimolar affinity to the intracellular opening of the pore and blocks potassium current. In the potassium channel encoded by the Drosophila Shaker gene, an amino acid residue that specifically affects the affinity for intracellular TEA has now been identified by site-directed mutagenesis. This residue is in the middle of a conserved stretch of 18 amino acids that separates two locations that are both near the external opening of the pore. These findings suggest that this conserved region is intimately involved in the formation of the ion conduction pore of voltage-activated potassium channels. Further, a stretch of only eight amino acid residues must traverse 80 percent of the transmembrane electric potential difference.\r"

To test whether this region controls potassium channel conduction, a 21-amino acid segment of the S5-S6 linker was transplanted from the voltage-activated potassium channel NGK2 to another potassium channel DRK1, which has very different pore properties. In the resulting chimeric channel, the single channel conductance and blockade by external and internal tetraethylammonium (TEA) ion were characteristic of the donor NGK2 channel. Thus, this 21-amino acid segment controls the essential biophysical properties of the pore and may form the conduction pathway of these potassium channels.\r"

Within hours of a peripheral nerve transection in adult rats, movements represented in neighboring MI areas are evoked from the cortical territory of the affected body part. One potential mechanism for reorganization is that adjacent cortical regions expand when preexisting lateral excitatory connections are unmasked by decreased intracortical inhibition. During pharmacological blockade of cortical inhibition in one part of the MI representation, movements of neighboring representations were evoked by stimulation in adjacent MI areas. These results suggest that intracortical connections form a substrate for reorganization of cortical maps and that inhibitory circuits are critically placed to maintain or readjust the form of cortical motor representations.\r"

The deficit was dose-dependent and sensitive to the duration of the delay period. These D1 antagonists had no effect on performance in a control task requiring visually guided saccades, indicating that sensory and motor functions were unaltered. Thus, D1 dopamine receptors play a selective role in the mnemonic, predictive functions of the primate prefrontal cortex.\r"

A telephone survey of primary care physicians in an area with a high incidence of STDs (Washington, DC) to ascertain the determinants and the extent of screening and counseling for STDs was completed in 1987. Ninety-nine physicians (33 internists, 38 obstetrician/gynecologists, and 28 family/general practitioners), representing 61% of those eligible, completed the interview. One third (39.4%) were screening for gonorrhea, more than one half (57.5%) for syphilis, and almost all (94%) had tested at least one individual for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Analysis suggested that concomitant screening for hepatitis B was significantly and positively associated with screening for gonorrhea and syphilis. Less than half (45.9%) of the physicians asked new patients about their sexual practices. Physicians should take histories of sexual practices and do more preventive counseling.\r"

The absolute numbers of infections due to pneumococci and anaerobes, and to tuberculosis, were not dissimilar to those reported in the literature, even though relatively few hemophilus infections were documented. The lack of Klebsiella sp infections was remarkable but not unexpected. Alcoholic patients had significantly higher rates of tuberculosis, cavitary disease, lung disease presumably due to anaerobes, and blood-culture-positive pneumonia. The relative concordance of our results for bacterial and tuberculous infections with those predicted from the published literature was striking. The high frequency of tuberculosis in our patients was particularly striking at a time when the incidence of tuberculosis nationwide, in patients without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has declined significantly.\r"

Even though these sera did not contain antibodies to R rickettsii detectable by indirect fluorescent antibody testing, such false-positive results from serologic tests for Rocky Mountain spotted fever can obscure the patient's correct diagnosis.

While having significant withdrawal symptoms, 50 hospitalized men were randomly assigned to receive either transdermal clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 4-day study period. Outcome was evaluated daily, medically and psychiatrically, using both objective and subjective measurements for dependent variables. No patient in either study group had seizures or progression to delirium tremens. The group receiving transdermal clonidine had a more significant response globally for the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, as measured by the Alcohol Withdrawal Assessment Scale. Also, clonidine more effectively lowered elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The core target symptom, anxiety, decreased significantly more in the patients receiving transdermal clonidine when measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and its subscale for somatic anxiety. Cognitive function responded equally in both study populations. Clonidine-treated patients reported less diarrhea, dizziness, headache and fatigue, and the chlordiazepoxide-treated patients reported less nausea and vomiting. We conclude that transdermal clonidine is effective treatment for the acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\r"

Four of these patients had duodenal obstruction. All four had had lateral pancreaticojejunostomy to relieve pancreatic ductal obstruction and associated chronic abdominal pain; three of the four also required biliary diversion for stenosis of the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Each duodenal stricture required reoperation and gastrojejunostomy to bypass the site of obstruction. A review of the English language literature revealed that duodenal obstruction in patients with chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis is uncommon, only 58 previous cases having been reported. All of those patients had pancreatic ductal obstruction, and more than half had concomitant distal biliary stenosis. Two thirds of the duodenal obstructions were treated by gastroenterostomy, and one third were resected. Duodenal obstruction in patients with chronic pancreatitis and biliary stricture appears to reflect an advanced form of the disease. Combined lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and biliary diversion has emerged as the preferred surgical procedure for this problem. Careful preoperative assessment for evidence of duodenal stenosis also is needed in this group of patients, and gastroenterostomy is indicated in appropriate cases.\r"

Fatal outcomes, however, represent less than 1% of injury events and thus provide a limited characterization of the problem. Future epidemiologic study resulting in injury prevention depends upon the development of morbidity-based injury surveillance systems. \"E-coded\" hospital discharge data bases (used to indicate external cause of injury) are a valuable source of information for monitoring and controlling serious, nonfatal injuries. An E-coded injury discharge data base was developed and evaluated at The Children's Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham. In addition to patient demographics, length of stay, total charge, and method of payment, E-code and \"N-code\" (to indicate the anatomic site of injury) data were collected. During the 2-year study period, 1077 discharges from the hospital were documented in children with serious injuries under 15 years of age for an adjusted discharge rate of 78.0 per 10,000 child-years. Injuries accounted for $5.3 million in total charges and 4899 total days of stay. Falls, unintentional poisonings, burns, and bicycle, motor vehicle-passenger, and motor vehicle-pedestrian injuries were the six most common causes of injury. Closed-head trauma accounted for 55.4% of motor vehicle-passenger injuries, 67.6% of bicycle injuries, and 51.8% of falls. Hot water scalds caused 36.4% of burns, and clonidine ingestion accounted for 22.1% of unintentional poisonings.\r"

Patients were followed prospectively after surgery for the development of complications. The data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods. Postoperative complications were strongly associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification, type of anesthesia, and type of operation. However, only a few laboratory tests, such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and nutritional status, were associated with postoperative complications. Therefore, in general, preoperative laboratory testing should only be undertaken for specific indications. Recommendations for routine tests are made depending on the age of the patient.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzed 33 variables that might potentially affect outcome in a series of 332 consecutive elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in a southern West Virginia community. One of the interesting features of this series was that the repairs were done by 22 surgeons with varying degrees of experience. The mortality and complication rates were compared for various potential risk factors by both univariant methods (chi 2, Fisher's exact, and Student t tests) and multivariant methods of analysis. Our early mortality (2.1%) and postoperative complication rates were consistent with those of other series. With multiple linear regression models, five factors were selected as significant independent risk factors associated with an increasing number of postoperative complications: the number of blood transfusions (p less than 0.0001), left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.0001), the presence of greater than 50% renal artery stenosis (p = 0.0012), the lesser experience of the surgeon (p = 0.0203), and the history of prior cardiac catheterization (p = 0.0245). The only factor statistically correlated with mortality rate was an increased number of postoperative complications (p less than 0.0001). Neither postoperative complications nor mortality rate was found to be significant and independently influenced by other demographic, clinical, or operative factors. It is tempting to speculate that surgeons with less experience might be well served to refer patients with significant renal artery stenosis and coronary artery disease. Our mortality and complication rates were not increased by performing preoperative angiography and therefore prudent surgeons may find this helpful in selecting patients for safer repair.\r"

We describe surgical experiences with 10 of the 28 patients who required 21 vascular surgical procedures for critical thoracic aortic arch arterial stenoses, upper and lower extremity ischemia, and renal artery stenoses. Four of the 28 patients initially had a stroke caused by occlusion of one or more thoracic aortic arch arteries. Six of the 10 patients underwent 7 bypass procedures for critical thoracic arch stenoses. All have remained free of stroke for 5 or more years. Four patients had five anastomotic stenoses or graft occlusions in late follow-up; the development of these stenoses did not relate to disease activity at the time of the operative procedure. All bypass grafts originating from the subclavian axillary artery developed anastomotic stenoses; no anastomotic stenoses occurred in bypass grafts originating from the ascending aorta. In contrast to other reports, no anastomotic false aneurysms occurred. Occlusions of major aortic arch arteries in Takayasu's disease cause stroke. Bypass of critically stenoses aortic arch arteries protects against stroke and is best performed with grafts originating from the ascending aorta. Anastomotic stenoses but not anastomotic aneurysms are common. This study suggests that aggressive surgical treatment can be performed with good results.\r"

In this prospective study, intraoperative salvaged blood was cultured in 401 patients, according to a direct plating technique. Bacterial growth was detected in 12.7% of cases. These results were compared with those obtained in control studies with sterile water and blood bank units under the same culture conditions. Most microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by other skin and environmental contaminants. Quantitative estimates of contaminations showed low counts of colony-forming units (CFU/ml): 82% of positive cultures yielded 1 or 2 CFU/ml and 6% had 5 to 20 CFU/ml. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 months to detect septic complications. No statistically significant correlation could be found between bacteriologic results of autotransfused blood and infectious complications. This study suggests that bacteriologic monitoring of patients who have undergone autotransfusion may help in detecting surgical field contamination. It also confirms that intraoperative autotransfusion adds little septic risk to cardiac surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine the influence of bacterial translocation on systemic immunity, since bacteria and their products play a major role in the development and maintenance of the host's immune system. To test this hypothesis, we measured the blastogenic response of mononuclear cells harvested from the blood, spleen, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes of control and Escherichia coli C25 monoassociated mice to a battery of mitogens. The E. coli C25 monoassociation model was used because this bacterial translocation model is not associated with experimental manipulations that are likely to affect the systemic immune system. The mitogenic response of lymphocytes isolated from the E. coli C25 monoassociated mice was significantly depressed compared to the control groups (p less than 0.01). Since the biologic significance of depressed in vitro mitogen responsiveness is difficult to determine, we assessed the ability of the mice to control a bacterial challenge using an in vivo Staphylococcus aureus abscess model. It appears that the observed changes in mitogen responsiveness may be of biologic significance, since the ability of the E. coli C25 monoassociated mice to control the injected S. aureus was impaired (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that an association exists between bacterial translocation and decreased systemic immune responsiveness.\r"

Mongrel dogs were allocated three groups: 70% hepatectomy group; a group that received dobutamine after 70% hepatectomy; and a group that received dopamine after 70% hepatectomy. Hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery to the liver decreased after 70% hepatectomy. Although oxygen consumption in the liver also decreased, oxygen consumption per liver weight increased after massive hepatectomy; an increase of oxygen uptake ratio and a decrease of lactate uptake in the liver were observed. When dobutamine or dopamine were administered after 70% hepatectomy, hepatic blood flow increased, followed by normalization of the balance of oxygen supply and demand in the liver; lactate uptake subsequently improved in the liver. The data support the conclusion that hepatic oxygen consumption affected by dopamine and dobutamine is associated with an increase in the extraction of lactate. Hyperdynamic hepatic circulatory support was advantageous to hemodynamics and metabolism in the residual liver after massive hepatectomy.\r"

We have shown previously that with the application of the basic principles of irrigation and with a dedicated irrigation pump that routine intraoperative angioscopy can be performed with consistent high quality results during lower extremity revascularization. In our total experience with angioscopy as a monitoring procedure during infrainguinal bypass grafting, 259 intraoperative angioscopies, during 63 femoropopliteal and 196 distal bypass grafts, were performed from May 1, 1987, to October 31, 1989. Mean total irrigation fluid used in the study was 448 ml (range, 0 to 1400 ml) with good visual quality in more than 80% of the studies. The overall failure rate was 1.5%. No complications were directly attributable to the insertion of the angioscope or the use of the pump. Based on the angioscopic findings, 124 clinical or surgical decisions were made in 259 of the angioscopies. The incidence of graft failure in this study was 8.1% (less than 30 days) and 4.8% (greater than 30 days) with a mean follow-up of 272 days. Direct inspection of the interior of the graft and native vessels at the time of surgery has resulted in the recognition of previously unsuspected vein-graft pathology. Angioscopy as the sole monitoring procedure for infrainguinal bypass grafting is safe, effective, and reliable and may not only improve the durability of these grafts but may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of graft failure and of the progression of the underlying atherosclerotic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Cholecystokinin is a choleretic in dogs. Some of the effects of cholecystokinin in stimulating bile flow in dogs are produced by cholecystokinin stimulating the release of other choleretic hormones such as insulin and glucagon. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cholecystokinin receptor antagonists on canine hepatic bile flow and insulin and glucagon release from the pancreas. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and intraduodenal fat were administered to dogs that had undergone cholecystectomy with chronic biliary fistulas with and without the administration of cholecystokinin receptor antagonists. Bile secretion and systemic venous insulin, glucagon, and cholecystokinin levels were measured. The cholecystokinin receptor antagonists benzotript and CR 1409 had no effect on bile flow or hormone levels when administered without cholecystokinin, whereas proglumide produced a large increase in bile flow without altering hormone levels. The response produced by proglumide may be the result of an osmotic effect produced by the substance being secreted in bile and its stimulating bile salt secretion in bile. CCK-8 and intraduodenal fat increased bile flow, bile chloride secretion, and cholecystokinin, insulin, and glucagon concentrations in venous blood. The cholecystokinin receptor antagonists benzotript and CR 1409 significantly decreased the bile flow and insulin and glucagon changes produced by exogenous CCK-8. The effect of intraduodenal fat on bile flow was not inhibited by the cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, whereas the increased insulin and glucagon levels were decreased significantly. Intraduodenal fat may release other choleretic hormones not affected by cholecystokinin receptor antagonists. The choleresis produced by exogenous CCK-8 is inhibited by cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, perhaps by inhibiting the release of the choleretic hormones insulin and glucagon.\r"

  ".W": "In a variety of animal models of acute pancreatitis, cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists have ameliorated the injury response. These results suggest that cholecystokinin may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis initiated by multiple stimuli. In an effort to test this theory, a sensitive and high affinity cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L364,718 was administered to four different models of acute pancreatitis that were produced in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas preparation. The four models of pancreatitis were initiated by cerulein infusion, partial duct obstruction with secretin stimulation, oleic acid infusion, and a 2-hour period of ischemia. In each model, pancreatitis was manifest by edema formation, weight gain, and hyperamylasemia during a 4-hour perfusion. In cerulein infusion-induced pancreatitis L364,718 inhibited edema formation and weight gain (31 +/- 5 gm versus 7 +/- 6 gm; p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased plasma amylase activity (36,605 +/- 21,216 U/dl versus 9421 +/- 5149 U/dl; p less than 0.05). The acute pancreatitis induced by the other three stimuli was not ameliorated by L364,718 treatment. We conclude that in the ex vivo-perfused canine pancreas preparation cerulein-induced pancreatitis is mediated at least in part by the cholecystokinin receptor. Early blockade of the cholecystokinin receptor was of no benefit in treating the other models of pancreatitis, suggesting that cholecystokinin is not involved in the early pathogenesis.\r"

Evidence regarding the association of blood transfusions with growth or recurrence of solid tumors is still conflicting both in clinical and in experimental studies, although diminished survival has been suggested in several studies. To determine the influence of blood transfusions and hypovolemia, as separate or combined factors, on tumor growth, we evaluated the weight of a subcutaneously implanted sarcoma (methylcholanthrene-induced) in 35 rats. After reaching 1% tumor burden (day 0), the animals were separated into two groups: hypovolemia (shed volume, 15 ml/kg) or normovolemia. These groups were further divided according to resuscitation: OO (no resuscitation), BL (receiving syngeneic blood stored in citrate phosphate dextrose for 4 days, 15 ml/kg), SL (receiving 0.9% sodium chloride, 45 ml/kg). Tumor dimensions were determined daily by external measurement, and tumor weight was calculated. Hypovolemia exerted a significant influence on tumor growth, independent of the resuscitation modality. The rats that received blood transfusions showed an increased rate of tumor growth, compared to the animals that received saline solution or no treatment. No interaction was noted between the effects produced by hypovolemia and blood transfusion. We conclude that the hypovolemic event enhanced tumor growth independently of the resuscitation, and transfusion of citrate phosphate dextrose-blood stored for 4 days did influence tumor growth in this model. We suggest that the effect of blood transfusion in patients with cancer has to be redefined to account for the influence of possible hypovolemic events.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of blood and extracellular matrix precoating of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts on the effectiveness of endothelial cell (EC) seeding was assessed in a canine experimental model. Part I of the study documented ex vivo platelet deposition in 256 ePTFE grafts, 6 cm x 4 mm internal diameter, after implantation as femoral artery-femoral vein or carotid artery-jugular vein arteriovenous shunts. These conduits were precoated with blood, fibronectin, laminin, or collagen type IV with laminin, after which they were seeded with enzymatically derived and cultivated venous canine endothelium at a density of 30,000 to 40,000 EC/cm2 of graft surface. Luminal deposition of Indium 111-labeled platelets, expressed as 10(8) platelets/cm2, at 30 minutes (n = 176) and 24 hours (n = 80), respectively, was 2.29 and 0.30 for blood, 2.83 and 0.37 for fibronectin, 0.99 and 0.08 for laminin, and 0.98 and 0.11 for collagen type IV with laminin. Part II of the study documented in vivo luminal EC coverage at 14 days of 6 cm x 4 mm internal diameter ePTFE femoral or carotid arterial grafts (n = 8) prepared in the same manner as part I ex vivo shunt grafts. EC coverage with blood, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV with laminin preparation was 42%, 49%, 44%, and 52%, respectively. The graft:carotid artery ratio of luminal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha release at 14 days with these same four preparations was 0.38, 0.31, 0.35, and 0.32, respectively. Precoatings of ePTFE prostheses with fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV are known to enhance the initial attachment of seeded EC. Fibronectin caused an insignificant increase in early platelet accumulation; laminin or laminin with collagen type IV preparations were associated with significantly less (p less than 0.005) deposition of platelets when compared to whole blood preparations. Most importantly, none of the four preparation techniques resulted in different in vivo rates of EC growth or luminal release of prostacyclin from conduits studied 14 days after implantation.\r"

Ten patients had significant anterior and lateral fibrosis. Five patients had loss of tissue planes between the prostate and rectum, however, no rectal injuries occurred. Estimated blood loss was 300-8,000 cc (median 1,000 cc). Operative time was one hundred ten to three hundred seventy-five minutes (median 185 minutes). Significant late complications are impotence (100%) and incontinence (55%). Tumor volume was 1.1-27.2 cc (mean 11.1 cc). Seven patients had seminal vesicle involvement, 9 had level III capsule penetration, and 6 had positive surgical margins. Follow-up ranges from one to fifty-two months (median 18 months).

Four patients have no clinical evidence of disease but do have detectable serum PSA, and 4 patients have evidence of metastatic bone disease on bone scan with elevated serum PSA levels. Radical prostatectomy following radiation therapy has no greater immediate morbidity or mortality compared with radical prostatectomy without prior irradiation and takes only slightly longer to perform. However, there is a marked increased risk of impotence and incontinence. More patients followed for a longer time are needed to assess the benefit of radical prostatectomy on survival of patients who fail radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred sixty-two men underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate (TRUS), digital rectal examination (DRE), and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination as part of an early detection program for prostate cancer. Thirty-seven (10%) cancers were detected. DRE had the highest sensitivity and specificity, 89 percent and 84 percent, respectively. TRUS and PSA had comparable sensitivities (84% and 81%) and specificities (82% and 82%). The positive predictive values of DRE, TRUS, and PSA determination were 39 percent, 35 percent, and 33 percent, respectively. We found a cancer detection rate of 16 percent among patients with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction and 5 percent in patients without these symptoms. The detection rate was 36 percent for physician-referred patients and 3 percent for self-referred patients. This suggests to us that at the present time the best utilization of medical resources to increase prostate cancer detection is to educate men to have annual medical evaluations by primary-care physicians who are encouraged to incorporate risk assessment and screening DRE as part of their routine practice. Any man with either abnormal findings on examination or increased risk should be referred to a urologist for further evaluation.\r"

The overall five-year survival was 40 percent, with patients presenting with prostate cancer doing better (50%) than those with bladder cancer (32%). Retrospective review of these cases suggests that primary therapy should be directed to the most advanced cancer. Incidental prostate cancer may be \"cured\" with a cystoprostatectomy and, when indicated, radiation therapy added postoperatively for the bladder cancer. Eleven patients presented with Stage A prostate cancer: 10 of the 11 were treated for their bladder cancer. Treatment was usually radical cystoprostatectomy with or without postoperative radiation. None died of prostate cancer. Patients presenting with advanced stage prostate cancer have had recurrence or have died of the cancer.\r"

Patients with greater pain but capable of completing this protocol also may be helped. While this group of patients fills the diagnostic criteria of IC and has many of the classic changes, many differ in that they have minimal or no pain, while simultaneously they have a dysfunctional bladder as expected from long-term low-volume voiding. All patients were placed on a protocol which focused on progressively increasing intervals between voids. Fifteen to thirty minutes initially were added to their present voiding time. The same increase was added to the voiding pattern every three or four weeks until an interval of three to four hours between voids was achieved. Twenty-one patients fit the criteria to be entered into this study. Overall 71 percent (15/21) had successful management of their symptoms and reported a 50 percent decrease in their symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia. Nineteen percent (4/21) reported 25 percent decrease in symptoms and 10 percent had no change. Presence of significant pain adversely affects outcome, 3/7 (with pain) improvements versus 12/14 (without pain). For all patients there was a significant increase in bladder capacity (92 mL average before study and 179 mL after) and average daily voids (13.2/day prestudy and 7.4 post-therapy). These differences in voided profiles were statistically significant (p value less than 0.01).\r"

All patients had preoperative demonstration of stress incontinence as well as urodynamic evaluation. Fifty-one percent of patients reported no stress incontinence and 76 percent reported that their sense of urinary control was better, or much better at the time of follow-up. Improvement was seen in all grades of stress incontinence. Age, weight, parity, and history of prior anti-incontinence surgery had no significant impact on success rates. Although preoperative urgency symptoms were more common among failure (28% vs 15%), this association was not statistically significant. However, persistent or de novo urgency symptoms postoperatively were highly associated with postoperative incontinence (p less than 0.005). The onset of recurrent incontinence was experienced more than two years postoperatively in 23 percent of the incontinent group.\r"

The 40 cm2 system delivered a daily dose of 2.8 +/- 0.16 (S.E.) mg (nominal dose 2.4 mg) and the 60 cm2 system delivered a dose of 3.99 +/- 0.24 mg (nominal dose 3.6 mg). Both systems promptly increased serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to physiologic levels, restoring normal erectile activity with an increased frequency of ejaculation and a positive effect on both mood and energy. There were no changes in serum sex binding globulin and estradiol, prostate or breast size, hematologic or liver function measures, or urinary flow and frequency. There were no significant changes in serum cholesterol or low-density lipoproteins, but high-density lipoproteins tended to decline slightly. There were no dermatologic problems associated with the system. The tenfold increase in DHT over baseline levels was attributed to 5-alpha reduction of testosterone in the scrotal skin. The TTS-T is convenient, reliable, and mimics normal physiologic testosterone secretion and levels more closely than conventional methods of testosterone replacement.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with renal cell carcinoma were treated with a lipophilic macromolecular drug, poly(stylene-co-maleic acid)-conjugated neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) dissolved in lipid contrast medium (Lipiodol). The drug was injected by catheterizing the renal artery and another feeding artery in 24 patients, and in the common hepatic artery in 1 patient with metastases to the liver after a radical nephrectomy. The procedure of selective arterial administration of 3-20 mg/mL of SMANCS/Lipiodol was simple to perform and was required once every two to three weeks. Total dose of SMANCS for each patient varied from 3 to 57 mg. Both SMANCS and Lipiodol accumulated more selectively in tumor than in any other tissue and remained in the neovasculature and extracapillary space for a long time. CT pattern of the remaining oil contrast medium in the tumor was characterized by the high-density area localized mainly in the periphery of the tumor around the central necrosis. When hyperviscosity Lipiodol (Lipiodol HV) was used as lipid contrast medium, it remained more persistently in the tumor and disappeared more slowly than Lipiodol. Moreover, the pronounced anticancer effect was recognized when SMANCS/Lipiodol HV was administered compared with only SMANCS/Lipiodol. Severe side effects, such as myelosuppression, unendurable pain, paralytic ileus, etc., were not observed. This targeting chemotherapy may be of great significance for advanced renal cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "An illness characterized by weakness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symtoms was identified among a crew of 30 migrant field-workers employed by a grape grower in Madera County, California, during August 1987. The onset of symptoms occurred between August 24 and August 30 and a median of 9 days from the date of first employment. The first crew member sought medical treatment on August 26, and 10 crew members were admitted to hospital between August 27 and August 30. For most workers, gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms resolved shortly after admission, but 4 patients had episodes of severe sinus bradycardia persisting for several days. On the day of admission, transient atrioventricular dissociation developed in 2 persons. Interviews with 16 crew members not admitted to the hospital identified only 1 additional worker ill with gastrointestinal symptoms, but all 16 had moderate to severe inhibition of both plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase. Four other workers who were tested but not interviewed also had cholinesterase depression. The crew had had exposure since August 19 to the organophosphate insecticide phosalone, which was last applied to the vineyard on July 21, or 29 days earlier. Although this is the first report unequivocally linking phosalone to field-worker poisoning, the delayed onset and nonspecific nature of the symptoms associated with subacute poisoning may have hindered the recognition of previous similar episodes.\r"

The ease of synthesis from inexpensive and readily available chemicals makes possible the rampant abuse of a dangerous drug that can produce a euphoria similar to that induced by cocaine. Clinicians should be familiar with the medical effects and treatment of acute methamphetamine toxicity.\r"

Since the realization in 1980 that bioassays for parathyroid hormone detected a cross-reacting substance in malignancy, progress has been remarkably rapid. A parathyroid hormone-related protein was purified and identified by molecular cloning as a 141-amino acid peptide with limited homology to parathyroid hormone itself. Nonetheless, both peptides activate the parathyroid hormone receptor to produce hypercalcemia. It is now clear that the parathyroid hormone-related protein is the cause of hypercalcemia in most solid tumors, particularly squamous and renal carcinomas. New assays for the hormone as well as the related peptide have greatly simplified the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia. At the same time, new agents for the treatment of hypercalcemia are becoming available, most notably the bisphosphonate drugs.\r"

In compressed, stretched or contused nerves, surgical repair at three months is indicated if functional recovery has not occurred. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are helpful in deciding which patients need secondary repair. Recovery is possible for 18 months following injury. Since nerve regeneration occurs at a rate of one inch per month, the distance from the nerve injury to the innervated muscle must be less than 18 inches. Therefore, the outcome is generally better in distal lesions than in proximal ones.\r"

The 80 patients treated before abrupt closure (group A) were compared with 167 patients with similar profiles who did not receive urokinase (group B). Procedural success rates were similar. Adverse cardiac events (abrupt closure, myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass, or death) in group A versus group B occurred in: 1 of 30 (3%) versus 5 of 27 (18.5%) (p = 0.07) with intracoronary thrombus, 5 of 45 (9%) versus 18 of 110 (16.3%) with unstable angina, 1 of 12 (8%) versus 4 of 13 (31%) with unstable angina with intracoronary thrombus, 4 of 33 (12%) versus 14 of 97 (14.4%) with unstable angina without intracoronary thrombus, and 5 of 24 (20.8%) versus 6 of 66 (9%) with intimal dissection. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 11% of patients who were treated with urokinase versus 9% of patients who were not (p = NS). No difference in blood transfusions existed. Thus urokinase was found to be safe during elective PTCA. In patients with intracoronary thrombus, urokinase appears to decrease the incidence of new adverse cardiac events, whereas in patients with intimal dissection it might have an adverse effect.\r"

They were randomly assigned to either thrombolytic and antithrombotic treatment (treatment group) or routine treatment (control group). Patients in the treatment group received streptokinase initiated late (mean 32 hours; range 12 to 49) after the onset of symptoms, followed by heparin infusion for at least 5 days and warfarin and dipyridamole for at least 3 months. Patients were examined clinically and by bicycle ergometry on discharge from the hospital and after 3 and 12 months. The two groups did not differ with respect to deaths or reinfarctions. There was a trend toward a lower incidence of angina pectoris in the treatment group. Exercise tolerance in this group was significantly higher than in the control group (at 3 months 124 +/- 39 W vs 107 +/- 41 W; p less than 0.05). The difference was entirely accounted for by patients with no previous history of infarction or angina pectoris (at 3 months 142 +/- 37 W vs 112 +/- 45 W; p = 0.01). ECG signs of myocardial ischemia, silent or symptomatic, occurred at significantly lower levels of exercise among patients in the control group compared with patients in the treatment group. The results support the notion that thrombolytic therapy given as late as 12 to 49 hours after the onset of symptoms may reduce the incidence of residual ischemia during the postinfarction period.\r"

The indicator is injected through a port located just proximal to the dilating balloon and the resulting changes in blood impedance are measured by electrodes at the catheter tip. Excellent linear correlations were found between known flow in 2 to 4 mm to diameter plastic tubes and catheter measurements (r = 0.99) and between timed collection canine femoral artery flow and catheter measurements (r = 0.97). Final validation was performed in canine coronary arteries using electromagnetic flowmeter data as the standard (r = 0.94). Thus accurate clinical determination of absolute coronary blood flow can be accomplished using this relatively inexpensive and simple catheter technique.\r"

To examine this early change in ventricular morphology, 14 open-chest dogs were studied with two-dimensional echocardiography before and after occlusion (10 minutes) of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD, n = 7) or circumflex artery (CIRC, n = 7). The endocardial surface area (ESA) and the area of abnormal wall motion (AWM) were reconstructed from the echocardiographic data using a previously reported technique for quantitatively mapping the ESA and extent of AWM. For the total group (N = 14), the mean ESA before occlusion was 48.9 +/- 9.8 cm2, increasing to 65.7 +/- 18.9 cm2 at 10 minutes occlusion (p less than 0.001). For the LAD subgroup, the mean ESA before occlusion was 50.7 +/- 9.3 cm2, increasing to 79.1 +/- 14.1 cm2 at 10 minutes following occlusion (p less than 0.001). For the CIRC subgroup, the mean ESA before occlusion was 47.1 +/- 10.8 cm2, increasing to 52.3 +/- 12.6 cm2 at 10 minutes after occlusion (p less than 0.001). The ESA increase for the LAD subgroup was significantly larger than that of the CIRC subgroup (LAD range 14.5 to 49.9 cm2 versus CIRC range 1.5 to 9 cm2, p less than 0.0001). Coronary occlusion resulted in similarly sized regions of AWM for both subgroups (LAD, 31.3 +/- 12.2 cm2 versus CIRC, 25.9 +/- 10.3 cm2, p = n.s.). For the LAD group, the largest increase in endocardial circumference occurred within the zone of AWM at the apex (39.9 +/- 12%). The endocardial surface area therefore expands immediately after coronary occlusion and the magnitude of this process is primarily related to the site (anteroapical) rather than to the extent of AWM.\r"

Eighty-seven body surface ECGs were recorded simultaneously. Recordings were taken during right atrial (RA) and right atrial and right ventricular (RA + RV) sequential pacing, which simulated WPW syndrome, during control periods and at 1-hour intervals for up to 5 hours after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In ECGs during the RA drive, diagnostic findings of MI such as abnormal Q waves were observed but became obscure during the RA + RV drive. On the contrary, the QRST values over the anterior chest during both drives were positive soon after coronary occlusion, decreased gradually as time passed, and became abnormally negative after 5 hours. The QRST isoarea maps during RA and RA + RV pacing showed quite similar patterns and were highly correlated with each other throughout this study (r greater than 0.95). These findings demonstrate that localized abnormalities resulting from MI are evident in QRST isoarea maps even in the presence of preexcitation and fusion.\r"

Ultrasound examinations were performed before and immediately after balloon inflation and 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area determined by the Doppler continuity equation method correlated well with that determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula, not only before but also immediately after balloon inflation (y = 0.87 x + 0.05, standard error of estimate = 0.22 cm2, r = 0.90). Serial calculation of mitral valve area by the Doppler continuity equation method showed a slight but significant decrease in the valve area at 24 hours after balloon mitral valvuloplasty but no change after that. We conclude that the Doppler continuity equation method provides an accurate estimation of mitral valve area before and even after balloon valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area dilated by balloon inflation is decreased slightly within 24 hours after the procedure, which corroborates valve stretch as one mechanism for increasing mitral valve area with balloon valvuloplasty. Estimation of mitral valve area immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty may overestimate the long-term efficacy of the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "The acute hemodynamic effects of a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, diperdipine, which is suitable for intravenous administration, were studied by right and left cardiac catheterization in 16 patients with coronary heart disease. Diperdipine markedly reduced systemic vascular resistance and improved stroke index and left ventricular ejection fraction. Mean pulmonary artery and wedge pressures were slightly increased as a possible consequence of enhanced venous return, whereas right atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures were not significantly changed. Nevertheless, an increase in preload was clearly indicated by an augmented left ventricular end-diastolic volume index after administration of diperdipine. Left ventricular contractility, which was estimated by the end-systolic pressure-volume ratio and by dP/dt max was not significantly changed, though analysis of individual data suggests a minimally negative inotropic effect. However, such a minor effect on left ventricular contractility was largely counterbalanced by the marked reduction of afterload, which produced a sharp improvement of stroke index. Enhancement of left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction in systemic vascular resistance were inversely and directly correlated to control values. Overall, diperdipine was well tolerated, but one patient had a major untoward reaction that consisted of an ischemic episode that was possibly related to drug administration. In conclusion, intravenous diperdipine appears to be a potent arteriolar dilating agent that does not affect left ventricular contractility.\r"

Following a baseline Doppler echocardiographic examination, esmolol was titrated to reduce the rate-pressure product by at least 20%. Once the patients had been receiving a maintenance dosage for 30 minutes, Doppler echocardiographic studies were repeated. Mean esmolol dose at target response was 17 +/- 16 mg/min, with the dosage range of 8 to 24 mg/min. Esmolol was effective in alleviating anginal chest pain in 18 of the 21 patients. Seven patients eventually underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and eight had coronary bypass surgery. The remainder were discharged receiving medical therapy including oral beta-blockade. During esmolol therapy, heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (86 +/- 14 to 68 +/- 12 beats/min and 125 +/- 16 to 103 +/- 20 mm Hg, both p less than 0.001). Cardiac output decreased from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.5 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than 0.001) secondary to a decrease in heart rate as stroke volume remained unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 47 +/- 12 to 49 +/- 13 with esmolol therapy, although this change was not statistically significant. Both the one third filling fraction as well as E/A ratio (ratio of early-to-late diastolic filling velocities) increased with esmolol therapy (35 +/- 8% to 38 +/- 8% and 0.73 +/- 0.2 to 0.85 +/- 0.23, both p less than 0.005), indicating improvement in left ventricular diastolic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Effect of antiischemic treatment on systolic and diastolic left ventricular wall motion was studied in 35 patients who had unstable angina pectoris and an electrocardiogram that indicated severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery narrowing. Treatment consisted of either a revascularization procedure (17 patients) or antianginal drug therapy (18 patients). All patients underwent a two-dimensional echocardiographic study within 48 hours (mean 20 hours) of entry into the study. This study semiquantitatively analyzed systolic performance of the ischemia-related segments by calculation of a total wall motion score. In 16 patients this investigation was combined with a continuous detailed recording of only the apical interventricular septal wall motion. This detailed study included measurements for regional function by providing a typification of the pattern of systolic and early diastolic excursion of the endocardial border of the apical interventricular septum. A repeat ultrasonic study was performed at least 1 month (median 2 months, 7 days) after admission. Results of the systolic wall motion analyses of all 35 patients showed, in both treatment groups, a significant improvement in systolic wall motion of the anterior and apical segments (mean total wall motion score at early study vs late study: revascularization, 6.9 vs 2.2 and medical therapy, 4.6 vs 1.0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis according to the presence or absence of collateral vessels showed no significant differences in the results of treadmill stress testing and myocardial imaging between these two groups. In patients treated surgically, the abnormalities recognized by these tests were normalized or improved when the bypass was patent. These data indicate that collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease cannot be seen angiographically unless there is total occlusion and the presence of collateral circulation cannot provide protection against stress-induced myocardial ischemia.\r"

The clinical manifestations, now known as the toxic oil syndrome, include pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy plus widespread vascular and neural lesions in other organs. Many of the late deaths ended with a scleroderma-like illness. Because scleroderma involves the heart, in this study we examined the small and large coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system from eight victims dying with the toxic oil syndrome. Dense fibrosis of the sinus node in two hearts resembled changes found in scleroderma. Atrionodal junctional hemorrhages and cystic degeneration of the sinus node present in the other six hearts resembled changes found in lupus erythematosus. Small and large coronary arteries exhibited focal fibromuscular dysplasia and a proliferative cystic myointimal degeneration. This latter abnormality was associated with sloughing of the inner wall and embolization of the detached fragment downstream in the same coronary artery. Every heart had many degenerative lesions within nerves, ganglia, and the coronary chemoreceptor. Both the arterial and neural abnormalities prominently involved the conduction system. Based upon observations by others with experimental feeding of rapeseed oil containing either high or low erucic acid, we suggest that this oil must remain a major suspected cause of the toxic oil syndrome, particularly in conjunction with some as yet unexplained facilitative influence by oleoanilids. If this is so, it is important to reconsider the widely recommended use of any rapeseed oil product as a suitable food for man or other animals.\r"

The extreme rate of the tachycardia during exercise, profound fluctuations in heart rate, and the presence of an abnormal P wave axis suggested the diagnosis of incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia rather than compensatory sinus tachycardia. Electrophysiologic study with endocardial activation sequence mapping confirmed the diagnosis of an ectopic left atrial automatic tachycardia, after which surgical cryoablation of the left atrial focus was carried out successfully and sinus rhythm was restored. Serial radionuclide angiocardiograms obtained before and after surgery demonstrated a very rapid recovery of left ventricular function to nearly normal within the first month after surgery, followed by further improvement to normal over the next several months. The diagnosis of tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy should be seriously considered in any patient with apparently end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and persistent resting tachycardia.\r"

To test this hypothesis we simulated atrial fibrillation in 28 isolated cross-perfused canine hearts and obtained an R-R interval scatterplot by plotting the R-R intervals as a function of the immediately preceding R-R interval. This scatterplot enabled us to detect a series of the shortest R-R intervals for a wide range of preceding R-R intervals, and this allowed us to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node in simulated atrial fibrillation. The estimated functional refractory periods correlated well with those measured by the conventional method (r = 0.93). We conclude that the proposed method makes it possible to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory periods of the atrioventricular node in atrial fibrillation.\r"

This alters myocardial stress vectors and results in adverse cellular and subcellular changes in the experimental animal. Clinically, such changes may contribute to the adverse hemodynamics reported with long-term ventricular pacing. To determine the feasibility of direct stimulation of the ventricular specialized conduction systems and therefore the potential for maintenance of normalized depolarization patterns, 13 beagle puppies were studied. Baseline ventricular activation and contraction patterns were obtained using intracardiac electrograms and multigated nuclear acquisition (MUGA) imaging. Septal electrode insertion from the aortoatrial groove was accomplished by use of two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring of the surface ECG during pacemaker implantation in five puppies. Standard right ventricular epicardial electrodes were implanted in five additional animals, with three remaining as age-matched non-paced controls. After 4 months of observation, repeat MUGA imaging and intracardiac electrograms demonstrated nearly normal biventricular activation and contraction patterns among the septal-paced group. Histopathologic examination illustrated normal cellular morphology in the septal-paced animals. This study demonstrates that pacing electrode insertion into the proximal interventricular septum is feasible and results in utilization of the normal ventricular conduction pathway. Such an approach to initiation of ventricular stimulation may attenuate the adverse effects of long-term ventricular pacing.\r"

  ".W": "Sequences of ventricular fibrillation-defibrillation cause transient hypertension; we hypothesized that this \"adrenergic overshoot\" might be blunted by the functional antiadrenergic effect of the calcium channel blocking drug nisoldipine, with a potentially beneficial reduction in myocardial oxygen requirements. However, other calcium channel blocking drugs have been shown to reduce shock success for defibrillation, a deleterious effect. Thus the purposes of this study were to assess the effect of nisoldipine on the hemodynamic responses to the sequences of ventricular fibrillation-defibrillation, and its effect on the energy requirements for defibrillation. In 16 dogs we administered intravenous nisoldipine (1 microgram/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.075 to 0.50 microgram/kg/min) to lower mean blood pressure 10% and 20% below baseline. Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically, and shocks of varying energy levels (30, 50, and 100 joules) were administered to determine defibrillation energy requirements. Heart rates and blood pressures were recorded up to 3 minutes after each shock to determine hemodynamic responses. Measurements were made before nisoldipine administration and again at the two levels of drug-induced blood pressure decline. We found that the usual systolic blood pressure \"overshoot\" after defibrillation (typically maximum at 15 to 30 seconds after shocks) was significantly blunted after nisoldipine administration (p less than 0.05). Heart rate slowing after defibrillation (a cholinergic response) was not affected. Nisoldipine did not alter shock success rates, which varied from 12 +/- 7%SE at 30 joules to 68 +/- 12% at 100 joules. Thus nisoldipine blunted the \"adrenergic overshoot\" of systolic blood pressure following defibrillation, a potentially beneficial effect, without altering the energy requirements for transthoracic defibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "Although a majority of studies indicate superior hemodynamic and clinical profiles of low osmolar compared with high osmolar contrast media, the effect of these agents on diastolic left ventricular function has not been examined. We prospectively examined hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function in patients undergoing contrast ventriculography with a high osmolar, ionic, monomeric contrast, diatrizoate (Renografin-76) compared with a low osmolar, ionic, dimeric contrast, ioxaglate (Hexabrix). Thirty patients were randomized to each group. There were no clinical differences between the two groups. The decrease in systemic pressures was significantly greater with diatrizoate after left ventriculography (-38.5 +/- 3.5 versus -18.2 +/- 2.3, p less than 0.001) and selective left coronary angiography (-29.5 +/- 2.4 versus -17.4 +/- 2.6, p less than 0.001). In addition, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly more with diatrizoate (7.3 +/- 0.9 versus 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg for ioxaglate, p less than 0.001). QT interval prolongation occurred in both patient groups. Diatrizoate decreased systemic vascular resistance, and increased cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction more than ioxaglate, while simultaneously increasing left ventricular end-diastolic volume and altering the peak atrial filling velocity. Negative dp/dt (p less than 0.05), but not Tau, computed by the logarithmic or derivative methods, was reduced by diatrizoate. These data indicate that significant alteration of diastolic filling patterns occurs with high osmolar compared with low osmolar contrast agents. Although the clinical significance of this observation is currently unknown, these data further support the reported hemodynamic superiority of the low osmolar, dimeric contrast agent ioxaglate during contrast angiography.\r"

Of 46 patients studied with mitral regurgitation, 35 (76%) had jets with distinct Doppler spectral envelopes recorded. The peak ventriculoatrial gradient was obtained by measuring peak mitral regurgitant velocity in systole and using the modified Bernoulli equation. This gradient was then subtracted from peak brachial systolic blood pressure, an estimate of left ventricular systolic pressure, to yield left atrial pressure (left atrial pressure = systolic blood pressure - mitral regurgitant pressure gradient). Noninvasive estimates of left atrial pressure from 35 patients were plotted against simultaneous recordings of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure resulting in the correlation y = 0.88x + 3.3, r = 0.88, standard error of estimate = +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Therefore, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and sphygmomanometry may be used in selected patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation for noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure.\r"

Validation of the technique has been suboptimal due to deficiencies of the reference standard, levophase angiography. To define the accuracy of echocardiography, we compared LA end-systolic volume by echocardiography in 27 patients with volumes by cine computed tomography (Cine CT), a highly accurate and validated method of measuring cardiac chambers. Echocardiographic tracings were made in the apical long-axis two- and four-chamber views. In patients with atria less than 300 ml, 14 had echoes performed prospectively, with optimization of LA size, while the remaining 10 were analyzed retrospectively. The volume of each slice was calculated and was then summated to obtain total volume. The correlation coefficient between two-dimensional echocardiography and Cine CT was r = 0.98, and it was r = 0.82 when patients with atria greater than 300 ml (n = 3) were excluded. Echocardiography underestimated Cine CT measurements by 23%. The slope of the prospective group was closer to unity than the slope of the retrospective group (p less than 0.001), and the correlation with Cine CT was slightly better for the prospective group (r = 0.88 versus r = 0.77). LA volume by two-dimensional echocardiography correlates closely with Cine CT, a more accurate method of volume determination, and gives valid measurements of LA volume. Efforts to maximize LA size during scanning limit inaccuracies of echocardiographic measurements of the left atrium.\r"

The extent of collateralization varies among species and among individuals. Collateral vessels are usually adequate for preserving resting regional and global ventricular function in the face of coronary obstruction. During stress, however, collateral supply may be inadequate. Collateral development is a time-dependent process during both the initial occlusion and following transient reflow and reclosure. Therefore when a previously collateralized coronary occlusion is recanalized and then recloses, the extent of the resulting collateral recruitment will depend, at least in part, upon the period of reflow between the two occlusions. The longer the reflow period, the less enhanced will be the collateralization. This is illustrated in the cases presented and has also been demonstrated in animal studies. The exact mechanisms for this recurrent collateral recruitment need further study.\r"

  ".W": "Within a few months of implantation, permanent pacemaker leads become ensheathed in fibrocollagenous tissue. This tissue may anchor the lead so that it is difficult, dangerous, or impossible to remove it. Leads with bulbous or finned tips are particularly resistant to extraction. The risks of applying traction to an entrapped lead include induction of bradycardia or ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, invagination of the right ventricle, avulsion of the right ventricular myocardium or tricuspid valve, hemopericardium, and cardiac tamponade. Forceful traction may result in uncoiling of the conductor, disruption of the insulation, or complete fracture, leaving an intravascular remnant that may embolize or be a source for thrombosis. Although fixation and abandonment of an inactive chronically implanted lead is frequently appropriate and is known to pose little long-term risk, the retained inactive lead may interact adversely with a new active lead and then increase the risk of venous thrombosis, serve as a potential nidus for infection, or produce spurious electrical sensing signals that may be sensed by the pulse generator. Absolute indications for lead removal are those in which there would be a life-threatening situation if the lead were to remain in situ. In the absence of an absolute indication, the decision to proceed with extraction must be made by weighing the potential for serious morbidity or mortality against risks of the extraction technique. Techniques for lead removal include traction and open cardiotomy operations. When a portion of the lead is intravascular, forceps, snares, baskets, countertraction, or lead-transection devices may be used to retrieve the fragment.\r"

The exercise and rest teboroxime studies were obtained within 3 hours of each other using a dose of 15 mCi/study. Because of the very short wash-out half-life of teboroxime, imaging was begun within 1 to 2 minutes after injection. Both SPECT and planar images were obtained; the SPECT protocol was modified by changing the number of frames, the time per frame, or the filters used for reconstruction of images. The planar images were obtained in the supine or upright position. Shorter acquisition time for SPECT (10 sec/frame) and the use of a Butterworth filter with a frequency cutoff of 0.3 cycle/cm and a power of 10 yielded best image quality. There was a close agreement with thallium results in identifying an abnormal or normal perfusion pattern in 89% of vascular territories. The scans were abnormal by both techniques in 12 patients, normal in nine patients, and discordant in only one patient. Thus Tc-99m teboroxime myocardial imaging is feasible at rest and during exercise using either SPECT or planar imaging. Shorter acquisition time and appropriate filtering for SPECT imaging and the upright position in planar imaging improve image quality and are convenient for the patient.\r"

Heart failure was found to be highly prevalent, affecting about 1% of persons in their 50s and rising progressively with age to afflict 10% of persons in their 80s. The annual incidence also increased with age, from about 0.2% in persons 45 to 54 years, to 4.0% in men 85 to 94 years, with the incidence approximately doubling with each decade of age. Women lagged slightly behind men in incidence at all ages. Male predominance was because of a higher rate of coronary heart disease, which confers a fourfold increased risk of heart failure. Heart failure, once manifest, was highly lethal, with 37% of men and 33% of women dying within 2 years of diagnosis. The 6-year mortality rate was 82% for men and 67% for women, which corresponded to a death rate fourfold to eightfold greater than that of the general population of the same age. Sudden death was a common mode of exitus and accounted for 28% of the cardiovascular deaths in men and 14% in women with heart failure. Hypertension and coronary disease were the predominant causes for heart failure and accounted for more than 80% of all clinical events. Factors reflecting deteriorating cardiac function were associated with a substantial increase in risk of overt heart failure. These include low vital capacity, sinus tachycardia, and ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Vasoconstrictors trigger a cascade of interacting intracellular signals that concur in initiating and maintaining contractions. Each step of these signalling pathways is a possible logical site for potential therapeutic interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in cytoplasmic levels of free-ionized calcium regulate the contraction and relaxation of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. Aside from changing the intrinsic rate of energy use within the cell, an intervention that alters the strength of contraction of cardiac or vascular smooth muscle must in general alter either the intracellular calcium level, change the calcium requirements of the contractile apparatus, or exert both effects. Intracellular calcium handling is modulated by at least three other important second messengers: cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate. These substances modulate intracellular calcium handling at multiple steps in the excitation-contraction coupling scheme. In vascular smooth muscle, diacylglycerol appears to play an important role in the regulation of myofilament calcium requirements. Intracellular calcium homeostasis is maintained through the action of sarcolemmal mechanisms that extrude calcium into the extracellular space; these mechanisms include a sodium-calcium exchange mechanism and an energy-dependent calcium pump. Abnormalities in electrophysiologic properties, sarcoplasmic reticulum function, energy use and supply, and contractile element interaction have been identified in experimental studies of animals and patients with various cardiovascular diseases. These abnormalities may be differentially affected by therapeutic agents that act on the heart or vasculature; therefore it is important to understand the underlying cellular abnormalities and subcellular actions of inotropic, vasoconstrictor, and vasodilatory drugs to apply rational therapeutics in the clinical setting.\r"

Ideally, vasodilator drugs used in the long-term management of heart failure should show clearly defined pharmacodynamic effects. These include reduced impedance to left ventricular ejection, increased venous capacitance, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced heart size, absence of neurohormonal stimulation, and slowed progression of left ventricular dysfunction. The mechanisms of action and sites of activity of the various vasodilator drugs currently available vary considerably, and none as yet has proved ideal for the treatment of heart failure or hypertension. The complexity surrounding the multiple vasoconstrictor mechanisms involved in heart failure has led to a rationale for combined vasodilator therapy and certain combinations are discussed. From a therapeutic standpoint, the development of drugs with multiple mechanisms of action is particularly attractive. Flosequinan is a new vasodilator agent whose cellular mechanism of action remains uncertain. Flosequinan has the advantage of being able to relax both arterial and venous beds and as such may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of heart failure.\r"

In another group it also improved calf blood flow and, therefore, blood flow to skeletal muscle. Also, using a number of different tests, it improved the exercise performance of the patients. In a further group the improvement in exercise tolerance produced was similar to that of captopril.

Contrast ventriculography was performed 1 to 4 days after AMI and repeated 5 weeks later. Wall motion was analyzed by the centerline method in the central infarct, peripheral infarct and noninfarct regions. In patients with ventriculographic data at the early catheterization, streptokinase-treated patients had less severe hypokinesia in the central infarct region than control patients (-2.9 +/- 0.9 [n = 29] vs -3.4 +/- 0.7 standard deviations below normal [n = 21], p less than 0.05). The benefit of streptokinase was more marked in the peripheral infarct region (-1.5 +/- 0.7 vs -2.1 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001). As a result, the ejection fraction was slightly higher in treated versus control groups (46 +/- 10 vs 43 +/- 7%, respectively; difference not significant). At 5 weeks, function in the streptokinase and control groups had diverged further because of continued improvement in the streptokinase-treated patients. This study shows that streptokinase benefits left ventricular (LV) function by 1 to 4 days after AMI, earlier than previously reported. The benefit was not limited to the peripheral infarct region, where ischemia might have been less severe, but was also seen in the central infarct region. The implication is that thrombolytic therapy can improve LV function during the period of myocardial stunning, while myocardial function is still recovering.\r"

Patients with positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes per 24 hours were included in this study. Administration of all chronic antiischemic medications except beta blockers were discontinued. During the first week all patients received placebo twice daily. During the second and third weeks, 41 patients received nisoldipine 10 mg and 41 patients received placebo twice daily. In the placebo group there were no changes in exercise parameters or in ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters. In the nisoldipine group, exercise duration increased from 403 to 448 seconds (p = 0.0035), time to 1 mm of ST depression increased from 224 to 298 seconds (p = 0.002), time to pain increased from 241 to 321 seconds (p = 0.01), and maximal ST depression was reduced from 2.6 to 2.3 mm (p = 0.002). Among the ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters in the nisoldipine group, only the number of episodes was reduced, from 14.4 to 11.6 (p = 0.0013) per patient. There was no significant reduction in total ischemic time (132 vs 120 minutes per patient). No significant side effects were observed. This is the largest clinical trial to date on the effects of nisoldipine on myocardial ischemia. The results indicate that nisoldipine was effective in improving all exercise parameters and only partially effective in suppressing ischemia during daily activity.\r"

Discriminant function analysis was performed using the following variables: patients' age, history of previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, blood lactate, urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, and chest x-ray cardiothoracic ratio. Variables that were found to significantly discriminate the 2 groups of patients were age, previous infarction, x-ray cardiothoracic ratio, blood urea and lactate concentrations. The risk index was computed, and blood lactate was the variable with the greatest predictive power for shock development. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the risk index, taking various cutoff points, were calculated. With a cutoff value of 1, sensitivity was 65%, specificity 91%, positive predictive value 36% and negative predictive value 97%.

Successful deployment and positioning were achieved in 55 of 56 patients. Occlusion of the stent was documented in 8 patients, the earliest occurring 30 minutes and the latest 8 months after implantation. Three of the occluded stents were recanalized by PTCA. Coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) were required in 4 patients: 1 for symptomatic restenosis, 1 for left main stenosis adjacent to the stent and 2 for acute ischemia during the in-hospital stay (less than 7 days). Myocardial infarction occurred in the territory of the stented vessel in 8 patients. Seven patients died between 1 day and 19 months after implantation. Local bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients, with 5 requiring blood transfusion. Restenosis within the stent was angiographically documented in 5 patients (9%). A new lesion in the treated vessel was found in 10 patients, followed by implantation of a second stent in 5 and a third stent in 1 patient. Medical treatment was instituted in the remaining 4 patients. Forty-nine patients (88%) are alive. Twenty-nine patients (51%) remained asymptomatic, and 44 (78%) are in a better functional class than before the implantation. Eleven of 15 (79%) major complications (acute occlusions or deaths) occurred in patients who received a stent in the left anterior descending coronary artery. In conclusion, implantation of the self-expanding intracoronary stent appears to be a new therapeutic option for treating acute occlusion or restenosis after PTCA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had undergone coronary catheterization and were initially treated medically. Follow-up study was performed at a median of 51 months. Separate logistic regression models, which had been previously developed to predict 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD), were compared using a Cox regression analysis to predict time to a subsequent cardiac event. The exercise electrocardiography model, consisting of the magnitude of ST depression, exercise heart rate and patient gender, was a powerful predictor (chi-square = 30.8, p less than 0.0001) of subsequent events. The exercise radionuclide angiography model, which included the exercise response of the pressure-volume ratio in addition to the exercise electrocardiography variables, had similar prognostic power (chi-square = 31.8, p less than 0.0001). In a separate analysis considering only cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, the exercise electrocardiography model remained a significant predictor of events (chi-square = 12.2, p less than 0.001). None of the radionuclide angiography variables added significantly to the prognostic power of the exercise electrocardiography model. Thus, in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram who are not taking digoxin, the supine exercise electrocardiography model that predicts 3-vessel or left main CAD also predicts future cardiac events. Exercise radionuclide angiography does not provide any additional prognostic information in such patients.\r"

Therefore, the relation of cardiac output (direct oxygen Fick method) to age was analyzed in 110 sixteen- to 64-year-old men with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension at the time of the hemodynamic study, who were alive and free of cardiovascular complications 7 years later. At supine and seated rest, during upright bicycle exercise at 50 W and and at peak work load, cardiac output was inversely (p less than 0.01) related to age. These relations were independent of weight and mean intraarterial pressure. Stroke volume decreased with advancing age at supine rest, but not at rest and during exercise in the seated position. Heart rate was not affected by age in the supine position, but was slower in older patients during upright rest and at peak exercise. In conclusion, in patients with essential hypertension who remained free of cardiovascular complications for 7 years, cardiac output was independently and inversely related to age at various levels of activity. These findings suggest that occult cardiovascular disease does not explain the decline in cardiac output with age in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "In a controlled, double-blind, crossover study, the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure (BP) and selected cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables were compared in 15 physically active and moderately hypertensive subjects. Guanadrel sulfate reduced systolic and diastolic BP at rest by -16 and -15 mm Hg, and at maximal exercise by -33 and -13 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.005), without affecting submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2), maximal VO2, ventilatory threshold, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or fatigue, as assessed by perceived exertion. In contrast, propranolol significantly decreased diastolic BP at rest (-16 mm Hg) and systolic BP at maximal exercise (-44 mm Hg); however, it significantly decreased submaximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), maximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), ventilatory threshold (-0.3 liters.min-1), minute ventilation at submaximal exercise (-7.3 liters.min-1), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (-0.27 liters), and concomitantly increased the rating of perceived exertion at maximal exercise (1.9 U). Guanadrel sulfate was also associated with significant decreases in mean fasting plasma glucose and total serum cholesterol, whereas propranolol resulted in an increase in serum triglycerides (p less than 0.05). In contrast to propranolol, guanadrel sulfate appears to decrease BP without evoking negative metabolic consequences or impairing exercise tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of long-standing systemic hypertension on left ventricular (LV) function during daily activities, ambulatory radionuclide monitoring of LV ejection fraction (EF) and blood pressure was performed during exercise and other structured activities in 31 hypertensive patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the absence of LV hypertrophy (group 1 [n = 16], LV mass 107 +/- 12 g/m2), presence of LV hypertrophy without electrocardiographic changes (group 2 [n = 10], LV mass 141 +/- 8 g/m2) and LV hypertrophy with associated electrocardiographic changes (group 3 [n = 5], LV mass 158 +/- 9 g/m2). The groups were similar with respect to age, baseline medication, treated and untreated blood pressure, resting EF and treadmill exercise time. Patients in group 3 had the longest history of hypertension. Peak filling rate was normal in group 1 (2.9 +/- 0.4 end-diastolic volume/s), but reduced at rest in groups 2 (2.4 +/- 0.4) and 3 (2.1 +/- 0.3). Patients in group 1 had normal EF responses to exercise and mental stress testing, as well as during routine ambulatory activities. Patients in group 2 had a blunted EF response to exercise, and those in group 3 had a significantly abnormal response. Both group 2 and 3 patients demonstrated abnormal EF responses to mental stress, as well as cold pressor testing in association with significant increases in mean arterial pressure and marked reduction in diastolic filling rate. Decreases in EF were also observed during routine patient monitoring in 3 group 3 patients and 4 group 2 patients. These events were associated with significantly increased blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if this derangement is reversible, the cardiac chronotropic control was assessed in 10 patients with class IV chronic CHF of various etiologies before and after compensation achieved by bed rest, salt restriction, diuretics and vasodilators. Mean time between the 2 studies was 15 +/- 3 days. The management was modified 3 days before the second autonomic evaluation, so as to reestablish the same diet and pharmacologic conditions of the previous study. Compensation led to significant reduction in symptom-based class, body weight, and pulmonary and systemic congestion. Mean +/- standard error of the mean HR responses (beats/min) before and after compensation were, respectively: (1) to atropine (0.04 mg/kg): 10 +/- 2 and 27 +/- 2 (p less than 0.01); (2) to handgrip (30% maximum capacity, 1 minute): 9 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 3 (p less than 0.005); (3) to headup tilt (5 minutes): 4 +/- 3 and 20 +/- 4 (p less than 0.005). Mean +/- standard error of the mean baroreflex sensitivity (ms/mm Hg) of RR responses to phenylephrine and amyl nitrate-induced changes in systolic pressure was, respectively, in each condition: phenylephrine, 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 8 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.05); amyl nitrate, 0.3 +/- 0.2 and 4.1 +/- 1.1 (p less than 0.05). A significant correlation between improvement in HR responses to atropine and tilt and changes in body weight was obtained. These findings show a reversible component of impaired baroreflex control of HR in severe CHF, possibly due to its congestive effects.\r"

  ".W": "To study the natural history of the hemodynamic performance of bioprosthetic heart valves, Doppler echocardiograms were recorded in a group of clinically stable patients at 2 and 5 years after replacement of native aortic valves with bioprosthetic valves. Eighteen patients completed a 2-year and 26 patients a 5-year follow-up examination. The effective orifice areas of identical models of bioprosthetic valves (Hancock II) were determined in vitro in a left-sided heart pulse duplicator system. In vivo Doppler-derived effective orifice areas were compared with the in vitro measurements for the same valve size. At both the 2- and 5-year follow-up examinations, the Doppler-derived effective orifice area was significantly less than the in vitro area (p less than 0.0001 at each interval). Ten of 16 valves evaluated serially decreased greater than 0.20 cm2 in the Doppler-derived effective orifice area between studies. The mean decrease in effective orifice area in valves evaluated serially was 0.25 +/- 0.29 cm2 (p less than 0.005). The peak transaortic gradient increased from 21 +/- 6 to 27 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The mean transaortic gradient increased from 12 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that serial Doppler echocardiographic studies demonstrate a deterioration in the hemodynamic performance of bioprosthetic valves over time in patients with no symptoms or signs of valvular dysfunction and that Doppler echocardiography may be useful for identifying subclinical bioprosthetic valvular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has been shown to increase the aortic orifice area and to improve clinical symptoms. However, there are only few data concerning long-term results after balloon valvuloplasty. In this study, 36 patients (11 men, 25 women, mean age 75 +/- 8 years) were followed after balloon valvuloplasty for a period of up to 18 months by means of clinical parameters and repeated Doppler echocardiographic measurements after 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Invasive measurements revealed a decrease of the systolic peak gradient from 78 +/- 24 to 38 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and an increase in the aortic orifice area from 0.58 +/- 0.23 to 0.93 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p less than 0.001). The Doppler echocardiographic approach revealed that the maximal instantaneous gradient decreased from 96 +/- 26 to 67 +/- 22 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The aortic orifice area increased from 0.49 +/- 0.16 to 0.73 +/- 0.21 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Three patients (8%) died in the hospital. After hospital discharge, 16 patients (44%) died and 8 patients (22%) underwent successful aortic valve replacement after a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 6 months. Nine patients (25%) were alive after a follow-up period of 18 months. Seven of these (19%) remained clinically improved. During follow-up, the Doppler echocardiographic results revealed a continuous trend toward the preprocedural severity of the aortic valve stenosis. Progression of restenosis assessed by Doppler echocardiographic measurements was accelerated in the group of patients who subsequently died or underwent repeat balloon valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement.\r"
