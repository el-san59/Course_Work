  ".W": "In Minnesota, several health care cost containment measures occurred about the time Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) was implemented. These included a moratorium on additional nursing home beds, preadmission screening of nursing home applicants, and rapid growth in HMO (health maintenance organization) enrollment by Medicare recipients. Hospital days per elderly Medicaid recipient decreased by 38 percent for those in nursing homes and by 35 percent for those not in nursing homes from 1982 to 1984. By 1986, hospital days per recipient had decreased 53 and 55 percent, respectively, from the 1982 level. Age-adjusted mortality rates for elderly Medicaid nursing home residents for the period 1977 through 1986 showed an increasing trend after 1982. Estimated age-adjusted mortality rates for the entire County population, which had decreased steadily from 1970 to 1982, rose significantly above the projected rate in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987. We conclude that, coincident with the institution of the PPS and other health care cost containment measures, use of hospital care has fallen for all elderly Medicaid recipients, age-adjusted mortality rates among those in nursing homes have increased, and the mortality rate trend for the total Hennepin County elderly population has stopped declining.\r"

During this time an increasing number of states passed, considered, or are currently developing breast cancer screening legislation. Most of these laws require some form of third party payment for mammography or establish breast cancer screening programs. The legislation varies markedly with regard to periodicity of examinations, ages covered, type and extent of third party coverage, dosage regulation, and radiographic equipment standards. This shows a need for common standards. Legislation provides an essential incentive for a public health response to a serious problem, but more than laws are needed. Health care providers and the general public need to be aware and take advantage of the coverage provided as a result of legislation. Moreover, public health officials need to be aware that such legislation may lead to a demand for services that exceeds present capacity to deliver them.\r"

However, awareness that lead-based paint is a source of lead poisoning in children dates back to the first few years of the twentieth century. Articles in medical journals and textbooks appeared in the United States and elsewhere, recounting cases of children poisoned by the lead paint in their homes on woodwork, baby cribs, and other furniture. The number of positively diagnosed cases was limited both by the imprecision of diagnostic tools and physicians' lack of familiarity with the signs and symptoms of plumbism in children. Nevertheless, a number of hospitals and at least one large city health department recorded numerous cases of child lead poisoning in the 1920s and 1930s. The mounting evidence in those years made it clear that child lead poisoning was a serious public health hazard. And the activities and statements of the lead industry's representatives left little doubt that they were aware of the dangers of lead paint. Nevertheless, the lead paint companies continued to manufacture and sell their product well past 1940.\r"

Sporozoites are formed from sporoblasts within the oocyst. The outer membrane of the sporozoites is derived from the single plasma membrane of the sporoblast while the inner 2 membranes are formed anew at the base of the differentiating sporozoites. A dense collar of intramembranous particles located on the P face of the outer membrane encircles the base of each budding sporozoite. The fact that this collar of intramembranous particles is located in the same region where the inner membranes of the sporozoites first make their appearance strongly suggests that the 2 are related, and that the collar may be related to either membrane synthesis or to membrane organization and assembly.\r"

The study group consisted of 66 hospitalized patients with clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 70 trauma patients without clinical AIDS (controls). Mean optical densities of antibody produced against RESA-4, RESA-8, RESA-11, (PNAN)5 and (NAAG)5 synthetic peptides of Plasmodium falciparum were compared between HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative patients using non-parametric statistics. HIV-1 seropositive patients with clinical AIDS had significantly less antibody to the synthetic P. falciparum ring stage peptide, RESA-8 (P = 0.001), than a comparable group of seronegative patients. Antibody levels were also low for the other ring stage peptides, RESA-4 (P = 0.024) and RESA-11 (P = 0.024). Although not statistically significant, antibody levels among the HIV-1 seropositive trauma patients were higher than among the HIV-1 seronegative trauma patients. During HIV-1 infection, a polyclonal B cell activation may occur as noted in the HIV-1 seropositive trauma patients, but with increased immunosuppression in advanced clinical AIDS, B cell stimulation appears to be diminished. This results in decreased production of malaria antibody.\r"

  ".W": "To identify Trypanosoma cruzi target antigens in overt Chagas' heart disease, a parasite lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened with the serum of a patient with a severe chagasic heart involvement (JL). Using a phage dot array immunoassay, 5 highly antigenic clones, JL1, JL5, JL7, JL8, and JL9, were probed with sera from clinically characterized T. cruzi infected subjects. The correlation of cloned T. cruzi antigen recognition with the clinical status of the subjects led to the identification of a recombinant antigen, JL5, that reacted predominantly with sera from patients with Chagas' heart disease. The antigenic determinant of the JL5 recombinant was a small 35 amino acid peptide. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence, together with other experimental data, allowed identification as the C-terminal portion of a T. cruzi P ribosomal protein. The C-terminal undecapeptide in JL5, EDDDMGFGLFD, was highly homologous to the same region of the human P protein SD(D/E)DMGFGLFD. The latter sequence has been identified as the P protein epitope in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Positive SLE sera reacted with the JL5 recombinant phage, suggesting that the T. cruzi P protein might induce antibodies with a similar specificity to that of P antibodies in SLE.\r"

The adjunctive role of antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of secondary pancreatic infections has received insufficient attention. Randomized clinical studies of effective antibiotics for prophylaxis or empiric therapy of pancreatic infections do not currently exist. In their absence, it is not known whether prophylactic antibiotics are useful in patients with acute pancreatitis. Until such studies are available, if antibiotics are to be used, their choice must be based upon indirect criteria: the ability of the antibiotic to effectively penetrate pancreatic tissue and juice, knowledge of the most common pancreatic pathogens, and the ability of the antibiotic to exceed the in vitro concentration (MIC-90) in pancreatic juice for the common pathogens. Recognition of the limited state of knowledge regarding antibiotics in acute pancreatitis may stimulate future investigations.\r"

  ".U": "90054435\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to determine if nitrous oxide can worsen myocardial ischemia by directly affecting coronary tone in the absence of changes in myocardial oxygen consumption. Three anesthetics were compared in each animal: isoflurane 1.8% alone, isoflurane 1.4% with 50% nitrous oxide, and isoflurane 1.8% with 50% nitrous oxide. Heart rate, systolic aortic pressure and left atrial pressure were held constant during the three treatments. In 12 isoflurane-anesthetized dogs the chest was opened and the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery cannulated and perfused with an autoperfusion circuit. Systolic segment shortening was measured in the LAD circumflex regions of the heart with a sonomicrometer. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres. Measurements were made during imposition of a stenosis on the perfusion circuit sufficient to decrease systolic shortening by 30-50%. The same stenosis was imposed three times in a randomized and balanced crossover design. When heart rate, blood pressure, and left atrial pressure were held constant, the substitution of 50% nitrous oxide for 0.4% isoflurane had no effect on myocardial blood flow or function in the ischemic or normal region. When nitrous oxide was added to 1.8% isoflurane, systolic shortening decreased by 35% in the ischemic and 27% in the normally perfused region, but myocardial blood flow was unaffected. The decrease in shortening was therefore not due to increased ischemia. The effects of nitrous oxide on ischemic myocardium can be explained by its well-known hemodynamic and direct myocardial actions. These results suggest that nitrous oxide does not have important direct effects on the coronary circulation.\r"

The RBF was found to be different in the five groups (normal, diabetics, patients with intermittent claudication, those with rest pain and those with impending gangrene. In diabetics RBF was significantly higher than in normal subjects. Even on standing, SBF in diabetics was higher and not different from RBF, indicating an ineffective venoarteriolar response (VAR). The VAR was also reduced in patients with claudication and was abolished in patients with rest pain and impending gangrene. In patients with rest pain SBF was increased. Laser Doppler flowmetry is a useful technique for evaluating skin perfusion in patients with peripheral arterial disease and for discriminating among different classes of patients.\r"

Mean percent increases in FEV1 were 35% in the high-dose group and 29% in the low-dose group at week 2. The high-dose group showed no loss of duration of bronchodilation with continued dosing. Improvement in PFTs and peak flow rates was significantly greater in the high-dose than in the low-dose group (p less than 0.05). Tremor was the most frequent side effect.

  ".W": "In shock, the presence of hyperlactatemia is prognostic of a failure to survive. An experimental model of stroke that combines bilateral carotid ligation and bleeding to a mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg induces hyperlactatemia like that associated with tissue hypoperfusion of hemorrhagic shock. In previous nonsurvival studies with this model, post-ischemic treatment of fed rats with 25 mg/kg of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) was effective in lowering brain tissue lactate but did not significantly affect the ischemia-induced increase in serum lactate measured after 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Investigators using other animal models treated hyperlactatemia associated with tissue hypoperfusion successfully with a DCA dose of more than 25 mg/kg. Our goal was to determine the effect of a higher dose of DCA on serum lactate in the model of cerebral ischemia with systemic hypotension that we had used in previous studies. The previously unstudied dose-response also was evaluated in our study. Rats that had been fed ad libitum were assigned randomly to either a real or sham (control) ischemic group. Immediately after 30 minutes of ischemia and subsequent reinfusion of blood or after 30 minutes of sham ischemia, rats received DCA (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg). Comparisons were made of blood values measured at the end of equilibration before ischemia, after 30 minutes of ischemia, and after 30 minutes of reperfusion. All ischemic rats were hyperlactatemic. Serum lactate levels were not correlated to blood glucose elevation during ischemia. After treatment in both control and ischemic rats, the percentage decrease in serum lactate varied as a logarithmic function of the DCA dose administered. Glucose levels and pH were not affected by DCA treatment at any dose. Because acidemia decreases lactate uptake by the liver, values for acidotic rats were compared with those for nonacidotic rats. Whereas lactate in acidotic rats decreased significantly only when treated with DCA, nonacidotic rats evidenced this decrease regardless of whether they received DCA. We discuss the relationship of these findings to the peak levels of lactate achieved, the resolution of hyperlactatemia, and factors that affect the interpretation of data in therapeutic studies using DCA.\r"

Nine hundred forty-two CSF samples were collected from 800 patients. The LET was compared in a double-blinded fashion with routine cell count determinations and cultures. We reviewed the clinical courses of all patients with positive cultures to assess the significance of culture isolates. Statistical analysis revealed LET sensitivity of 84.4% and specificity of 98.1% for clinical presentations of bacterial meningitis for which initiation of therapy is currently recommended. The LET identified culture-proven cases of meningitis with sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 95%. We propose the LET as an adjunct to, but not a replacement for, CSF cell count and chemistry determination in the initial laboratory assessment of bacterial meningitis. It is a reasonable screen that allows rapid initiation of treatment and directs the laboratory technician to devote extra attention to examination of a CSF specimen with a higher likelihood of pathology.\r"

The clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities used, and accuracy of diagnosis by emergency physicians were analyzed. The most common historical features were headache (81 patients, or 74%), nausea or vomiting (85 patients, or 77%), and loss of consciousness (58 patients, or 53%). Nonexertional activities preceding SAH were more frequent than exertional events (57% vs 21%). Neurologic findings were present in 70 patients (64%) and consisted primarily of altered levels of consciousness. Thirty-eight patients (35%) had nuchal rigidity. Ninety-six emergency cranial computed tomography scans were performed, of which 91 were diagnostic for SAH (sensitivity, 95%). Lumbar puncture was performed on two patients with normal computed tomography scans and revealed bloody spinal fluid. The overall diagnostic accuracy by emergency physicians was 85%. The correct diagnosis was delayed in 16 patients (15%), the majority of whom had headaches and normal neurologic examinations. Atypical symptoms, the warning leak syndrome, and the need for prompt diagnosis and therapy are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Emergency helicopter services provided by trauma centers are now being perceived as contributing to the financial burden of the hospital because of recent changes in trauma reimbursement under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) and because of the general perception that collection rates are lower among trauma patients. The use of helicopters to transfer patients from one acute care facility to another may also be concentrating the patients with low collection rates at the receiving hospital. We examined retrospectively the demographic and clinical factors associated with the collection experience in a series of 288 trauma patients transferred by helicopter from another acute care facility to an inner-city hospital. Factors affecting payment at 180 and 360 days included patient age, insurance class, discharge status, and size of the hospital charge. As long as reimbursement continues to be cost-based for nonMedicare patients, collection rates remain an important consideration in determining the financial viability of using helicopters to transfer patients.\r"

The patients were randomized to 3 wk of in-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation (Group I, seven patients) or the same program plus ENPV (Group II, nine patients). Both groups were similar in terms of age (65 +/- 8 versus 61 +/- 13 yr), severity of CAO (FEV1 of 0.64 +/- 0.14 versus 0.59 +/- 0.18 L), and PaCO2 (44 +/- 9 versus 45 +/- 7 mm Hg). Blood theophylline levels and nutritional status were also similar in both groups. Baseline ET (2.9 +/- 0.6 versus 3.8 +/- 1.6 min) and Pdimax (45 +/- 15 versus 56 +/- 18 cm H2O) were decreased in both groups. Baseline TTdi was high but similar in both groups; at rest the values were 0.15 +/- 0.05 versus 0.16 +/- 0.04, and at end-exercise they were 0.17 +/- 0.06 versus 0.21 +/- 0.12.

  ".U": "90054624\r", 
  ".W": "The decrease in left ventricular (LV) stroke volume during positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been attributed to reduced LV filling and a decreased contractile state. To assess the relative importance of each mechanism, we examined the effects of zero, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O PEEP on LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), and on LV contractile performance using instantaneous pressure-volume loops recorded with micromanometer-tipped and volume conductance catheters in the LV. The LV contractile state was determined using the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relations, the LV dP/dtmax-EDV relation, and the LV stroke work-EDV relation. The importance of autonomic reflexes was assessed by repeating the sequence of PEEP after beta-adrenergic blockade using metoprolol, 10 mg administered intravenously. LV EDV decreased from a baseline of 37.8 +/- 3.7 ml (+/- SEM) to 35.0 +/- 3.8, 28.7 +/- 2.9, and 25.9 +/- 2.6 ml with 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O PEEP, respectively (p less than 0.05 for each comparison), which paralleled the decline in stroke volume. In contrast, LV ESV did not change significantly with PEEP. The slope and position of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the slopes of the LV dP/dtmax-EDV relation and the LV stroke work-EDV relation (p = NS) were not altered during PEEP before or after beta-adrenergic blockade, indicating no depression of systolic contractile function. We conclude that the decreased LV stroke volume that occurs with PEEP is due to impaired LV filling (i.e., reduced LV EDV) without a concomitant depression of myocardial contractility.\r"

Thirteen patients receiving AB (baseline PaO2, 54.3 +/- 4.9 mm Hg; mean +/- SD) and 12 patients receiving placebo (baseline PaO2, 53.0 +/- 4.1 mmHg) were periodically followed by arterial blood gas and other pulmonary function studies and plasma levels of AB. Eight patients receiving AB and nine patients receiving placebo were followed for 1 yr; all patients were followed for at least 90 days. AB administration resulted in an increase in PaO2 to 62.2 +/- 9.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) on Day 28. The increase was maintained until Day 360 (63.8 +/- 4.6 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). The mean plasma concentration of AB on Day 28 was approximately one-half that on Day 90 when the plasma level reached a near maximum. AB was associated with weight loss (five of 13 patients receiving AB lost more than 10% of their baseline body weight) and peripheral paresthesias of the lower extremities (three patients), both occurring at the peak plasma levels of the drug. We conclude that AB causes a long-term improvement in arterial oxygenation in hypoxemic patients with COPD residing at an altitude of 1,500 m. Our data suggest that lower doses of AB might produce the same effect on PaO2 with less adverse associated effects, and this should be tested in future studies.\r"

The swallowing reflex was induced by bolus injections of a small amount of distilled water (0.5 ml) into the pharynx at four different values of endexpiratory airway pressure (0,5,10, and 15 cm H2O CPAP) or by continuous infusion of water (3 ml/min) at two different values of endexpiratory airway pressure (0 and 15 cm H2O CPAP). The latency of response from the time of bolus injection of water to the occurrence of the first swallow as well as the number of swallows elicited during the period of 10 s immediately following the water injection were measured. Our results showed that increases in endexpiratory airway pressure progressively prolonged the latency of response and decreased the number of swallows. Also, the frequency of swallows decreased greatly at nasal CPAP of 15 cm H2O during continuous infusion of water. These results indicate that nasal CPAP exerts an inhibitory influence on the swallowing reflex.\r"

We investigated this phenomenon in 10 patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea who had nocturnal oxygen desaturations to less than 85% (Group I), 10 patients with mild sleep apnea and no significant desaturations (Group II), and six obese control subjects (Group III). VO2 was measured by respired gas analysis before and after passive leg raising, which has been shown to increase DO2 by 10 to 12%. This was verified by thermodilution cardiac output measurements in four obese patients. In patients with severe sleep apnea, mean apnea index was 53 +/- 11, and supine VO2 was 141 +/- 40 ml/min/m2, whereas with leg elevation it rose to 163 +/- 41 ml/min/m2 (p less than 0.005). In patients with mild sleep apnea and in obese control subjects (mean apnea indices of 24 +/- 6 and 4 +/- 1, respectively), supine VO2 was 144 +/- 11 and 152 +/- 10 ml/min/m2, respectively; with leg elevation, VO2 was 144 +/- 13 and 151 +/- 6 ml/min/m2, respectively (p greater than 0.6). The study was repeated in nine of the Group I patients after 8 wk of treatment with nasal CPAP (Group IA).

To evaluate the efficacy of LY171883, we studied 138 nonsmoking asthmatic patients, 18 to 65 yr old, in a double-blind, randomized block-design study. All patients were required to demonstrate a greater than or equal to 15% increase in FEV1 after inhaled bronchodilator use and were then randomly assigned to either LY171883 (600 mg) or placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was measured by inhaled metaproterenol use (mg/wk), symptoms, twice-daily peak expiratory flow, and weekly FEV1 measurements. LY171883-treated patients had improved FEV1 values upon completion of the treatment period compared with placebo recipients (p = 0.003). Metaproterenol use decreased in both groups, but treatment differences, though not statistically significant, favored LY171883 (p = 0.089). Of patients who used at least 23 mg/wk of metaproterenol (36 inhalations) at initiation of the study, those who received LY171883 used significantly less metaproterenol than those who received placebo (p = 0.007). LY171883 was well tolerated and reduced the need for a bronchodilator drug while improving pulmonary function. Results of this study support the hypothesis that leukotrienes LTD4 and/or LTE4 may be important in the pathogenesis of asthma in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which a deep inspiration (DI) induces bronchoconstriction in some asthmatic patients remain unclear. As a calcium-dependent myogenic response could be involved, we examined the effect of a potent voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDC) antagonist, nifedipine (20 mg administered sublingually) versus placebo, on the DI-induced change in plethysmographic specific airway conductance (SGaw) in six asthmatic patients and six healthy controls both before and after a bronchial challenge with methacholine (MCh). In the asthmatic group, when compared to those receiving placebo, nifedipine significantly reduced the decrease in SGaw induced by the DI at baseline (-34.2 +/- 5.6 and -12.7 +/- 3.6%, respectively) but it had no significant effect on mean SGaw baseline values (0.096 +/- 0.018 and 0.075 +/- 0.015 cm H2O-1.s.-1, respectively). When airway tone was increased with MCh, the DI-induced change in SGaw was reduced and nifedipine then had no further effect. In the control group, nifedipine had no significant effect on the weak changes in SGaw induced by the DI before or after the bronchial challenge. We conclude that nifedipine reduces DI-induced bronchoconstriction only in subjects with asthma and without altering baseline tone in airway smooth muscle. We suggest that this effect of nifedipine could be explained by the existence of a myogenic response in asthma, caused by the conversion of airway smooth muscle from intermediate to single unit function.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the lung has only a narrow range of structural responses to injury. For example, long-term injury results in emphysema, fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Clinical and experimental models of chronic pulmonary hypertension suggest that this disease can be triggered by a number of interventions and that the structural changes in the pulmonary arterial circulation may vary depending on the stimulus. This report briefly reviews the structural changes that accompany the development of pulmonary hypertension in hypoxia- and Crotalaria-induced pulmonary hypertension in the rat and in repeated endotoxemia and continuous air embolization in the sheep. The studies indicate that of the structural changes considered characteristic of chronic pulmonary hypertension, the reduction in peripheral arterial volume as reflected by a loss in number of barium-filled arteries, extension of muscle into smaller intra-acinar arteries than normal, and reduction in external diameter of intra-acinar arteries are the changes that contribute to the sustained rise in pulmonary artery pressure. Increased medial and adventitial thickness of the normally muscular arteries seem to be secondary changes to this disease. Because the severity and range of structural changes differ between the experimental models of pulmonary hypertension, the data suggest that the lung, particularly the pulmonary arterial circulation, may have a more complex response to injury than originally suspected.\r"

Over the past two decades, P. carinii has been recognized with increasing frequency as a cause of pneumonia in cancer patients, transplant recipients, and patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). With the increased number of cases of P. carinii pneumonia and a greater emphasis on studying this organism, sophisticated immunologic, metabolic, and molecular biologic tools have ben applied to enhance diagnosis, therapy, and prevention. Immunologic studies have identified specific antigens of human P. carinii, resulting in the development of new diagnostic tests and more specific serologic data. Metabolic studies have allowed screening and identification of new therapeutic and preventive drugs. The development of nucleic acid libraries has allowed enzymes and other proteins to be elaborated in large quantities, facilitating a wide range of studies. These new techniques have changed and will continue to change the ways that pneumocystis pneumonia is diagnosed, treated, prevented, and understood.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTING: Community internal medicine practices. PATIENTS: Five hundred and ten continuing patients with functional disabilities who saw their physicians at least four times a year. PHYSICIANS: Seventy-six UCLA clinical volunteer faculty who are internists in community office practices. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians and their patients were randomly assigned to the experimental or the control group. Experimental group physicians attended a 2-hour multimedia educational session and received four functional status reports on each of their study patients over a 1-year period. Control group physicians received no education and no functional status feedback. Control group and experimental group patients were tested for functional status with the functional status questionnaire every 4 months for 1 year. Both groups also completed monthly diaries that measured use of health services. Experimental group physicians answered an anonymous evaluation questionnaire at 6 months after study entry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-three percent of experimental group physicians reported that they had used the functional status questionnaire to change therapy. Ninety-five percent reported that it was useful and accurate. Patient diaries did not show any difference between experimental group patients and control group patients in number of medications used, visits to physicians or other health professionals, equipment purchased, diet, or exercise programs. There were no significant differences between experimental and control group patients at exit from the study on any functional status or health outcome measure. CONCLUSION: A more powerful intervention than a 2-hour educational session and the regular provision of functional status information is needed to help office-based internists improve patient outcomes.\r"

DESIGN: Open-label, phase II study of rhGM-CSF. SETTING: Inpatient hematology and surgery clinic at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Four consecutive patients with chronic severe neutropenia, which in two cases was complicated by severe infection, in one case by perianal fistula, and in one case by complete rectal prolapse. Two patients had chronic idiopathic neutropenia; one patient had congenital neutropenia (myelokathexis); and one patient had autoimmune neutropenia. INTERVENTIONS: The rhGM-CSF was given intravenously or subcutaneously at starting dosages of 150 to 1000 micrograms/m2 body surface area.d for 12 to 14 consecutive days. Two patients received a second course of daily rhGM-CSF treatment after a nontreatment interval of 14 to 20 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all four patients, the absolute neutrophil counts increased from less than 0.25 x 10(9)/L to 3.2 to 19.2 x 10(9)/L within 2 weeks of beginning rhGM-CSF therapy. Two patients had life-threatening infections that resolved during therapy. The two other patients had major ano-rectal surgery during rhGM-CSF treatment and had no postoperative infections. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic neutropenia, rhGM-CSF may increase neutrophil counts. This therapy may be a useful adjunct to antibiotic therapy for patients with infection and perioperatively for patients having anorectal surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically acquired acyclovir resistance in herpes simplex has usually been associated with a deficiency in viral thymidine kinase, which, in turn, has been linked with attenuated virulence in animal models. Diminished pathogenicity in thymidine kinase-deficient isolates has been partly responsible for controversies about the clinical significance of antiviral resistance. We report on a series of resistant virus isolates from a patient who had severe, progressive esophagitis. These isolates had various thymidine kinase activities, ranging from 2.8% to 130% when compared with the activity of the isolate obtained before treatment; the resistant isolate 615 retained enzyme activity as well as neurovirulence in an encephalitis model. Plaque purification showed a heterogeneous mixture containing at least one acyclovir-resistant, foscarnet-resistant plaque isolate (615.8) fully able to phosphorylate acyclovir. The 3.3-kbp BamHI fragment containing most of the DNA polymerase gene from isolate 615.8 was purified and used to successfully transfer both acyclovir and foscarnet resistance. Acquisition of in-vitro acyclovir resistance was associated with progression of clinical disease, as well as with maintenance of pathogenicity in an animal model and at least one mutation in viral DNA polymerase. Patients with herpes simplex infections that progress during acyclovir therapy should be observed for acquisition of resistance in the setting of antiviral chemotherapy; future studies should also consider the presence of heterogeneous virus populations in such patients.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (safflower oil) two-period crossover trial with 12-week treatment periods. SETTING: Outpatient general medicine clinic at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight men with plasma cholesterol between 5.68 and 7.76 mmol/L (220 to 300 mg/dL), triglyceride levels less than 3.39 mmol/L (300 mg/dL), and free of coexisting diseases. INTERVENTIONS: Fish oil and placebo (safflower oil) supplementation. After basal measurements and a 4-week lead-in period, twenty 1-g capsules of either fish oil or placebo oil were provided for 12 weeks (period 1). After a 4-week washout phase participants then received the other oil for an additional 12 weeks (period 2). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood was drawn at the beginning and end of each study period and analyzed for levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation. Total and LDL cholesterol increased from the before treatment values by 4.8% and 9.1%, respectively, after ingestion of fish oil. Compared with placebo, LDL cholesterol was significantly higher (4.5 compared with 4.1 mmol/L, P = 0.01) and triglycerides lower (1.3 compared with 1.8 mmol/L, P = 0.01) after fish oil. Total and HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 and B levels did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil supplements do not lower plasma cholesterol levels in middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia without elevated triglycerides. They should not be recommended as a method to lower plasma cholesterol in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Acute urinary tract infection is a major health problem among women, accounting for considerable morbidity and health care costs. We review recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of these infections. In acute lower urinary tract infection, empiric short-course therapy (single-dose or 3-day therapy) with one of several antibiotics is recommended in the absence of complicating factors. When complicating factors are present, the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the infecting organism should be determined and therapy with an appropriate agent should be provided for 7 days. Ampicillin and related drugs are probably inferior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of occult renal infection. In acute pyelonephritis, most patients require hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics until they can take oral medications. In uncomplicated cases, a single broad-spectrum intravenous agent can be used initially, followed by an oral agent selected on the basis of antibiotic-susceptibility testing results. Patients with uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis who are less ill can be managed with oral therapy as outpatients, again with reference to the results of antibiotic-susceptibility testing. Complicated acute pyelonephritis requires more aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures. Therapy for uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis should be given for 14 days. The role of post-therapy cultures in the management of urinary tract infection is not well defined, but cultures probably can be safely omitted in most cases of uncomplicated acute cystitis.\r"

Additionally an impressive array of therapeutic approaches has been developed to interfere with the generation of free radicals and to thereby salvage jeopardized myocardium. Based on these data clinical trials are now being conducted or planned. However, a critical examination of the experimental data raises questions that undermine total acceptance of the conclusions of the investigators and the enthusiastic extrapolations to the clinical arena. Issues such as endotoxin contamination of infused free radical scavenger enzymes, incorrect dosing, possibly improper selection of control conditions, species specificity, inadequate consideration of the dependence of infarct size on coronary collateral blood flow, and the possibly transient nature of any benefits of anti-free radical interventions cast doubt on some of the accumulated data and their general applicability to humans. These issues must be satisfactorily addressed before this experimental approach can be fully embraced by the clinical cardiologist. Additionally, uniformity in the experimental model and conditions might eliminate some of the confusion and make it easier to compare the results of different studies. Free radical mechanisms may be important in the heart, but more data are needed to rigorously document an unequivocal effect of therapeutic interventions in experimental models before clinical trials are appropriate.\r"

After exercise the mean heart rate was 111 beats per minute (bpm) in the vehicle group and 102 to 103 bpm in the three levobunolol groups, which were significantly different from the control group but not from each other. In a randomized double-masked, parallel, chronic study, 117 patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) instilled one of the three drop sizes of levobunolol twice daily for three months. Mean decreases in IOP ranged from 5.1 to 6.0 mmHg in the three groups, not significantly different from each other in mean IOP, heart rate, or blood pressure. We conclude that drop size in the range tested had no clinically significant effect on either efficacy or safety of a beta blocker such as levobunolol.\r"

In this article we review recent investigations into the biological effects, regulation of production, and mechanisms of action of the best characterized trophic molecule, nerve growth factor. In addition we review studies characterizing brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other putative neurotrophic molecules. Finally, we discuss how pharmacological effects of these molecules may be relevant to the therapy of disease states as well as neural regeneration.\r"

Other features of clinical interest possessed by certain of the newer macrolides include the potential for once-daily dosing, resistance to acid degradation in the stomach without enteric coating, and possibly reduced gastrointestinal side effects. The new macrolides are expected to retain the clinical indications of erythromycin, which include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, and genital tract infections caused by erythromycin-susceptible organisms. In addition, enhanced activity has been demonstrated in animal models and in vitro against toxoplasma, Legionella, Haemophilus, and Campylobacter spp. New macrolide derivatives also show promise to expand the antimicrobial spectrum of erythromycin to include Mycobacterium and Borrelia spp.\r"

All patients received intravenous fluids for rehydration and no other drugs. The total volumes of stool (mean +/- standard deviation) during a 6-day period after treatment were significantly smaller in the tetracycline group (10.5 +/- 8.6 liters) than in the furazolidone group (20.9 +/- 15.9 liters) and the placebo group (19.1 +/- 10.5 liters) (P less than 0.01). The duration of diarrhea and volumes of intravenous fluids were also significantly reduced in the tetracycline group (P less than 0.05). However, there were no differences between the furazolidone and the placebo groups with regard to stool volume, intravenous fluid, and duration of diarrhea. Within 48 h of treatment, tetracycline significantly reduced the number of patients with positive stool cultures for V. cholerae (37%) compared with furazolidone treatment (96%) and the placebo (97%) (P less than 0.001). Although the tetracycline group had a significantly higher incidence (61%) of bacteriologic relapse (negative stool cultures on days 2 and 3, followed by positive cultures afterward) compared with that in the furazolidone group (40%) and the placebo group (33%), this was not associated with clinical relapse. There were no differences between the furazolidone and placebo groups with regard to any of the bacteriologic responses examined. These data indicate that a single dose of 1 g of tetracycline is effective in the treatment of cholera, but it is asymptomatic bacteriologic relapse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae from seriously ill patients in Chicago, Ill., have been identified as resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam but susceptible to other cephalosporins. This unusual antibiogram was shown to be due to a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which readily hydrolyzed ceftazidime and aztreonam in addition to penicillins such as piperacillin and carbenicillin. This enzyme and its attendant resistance were transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation on a 50-kilobase plasmid. Isoelectric focusing revealed a single beta-lactamase band with a molecular weight of 29,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.57 in the resistant isolates and transconjugants. The beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam restored beta-lactam susceptibility in the resistant isolates. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of clavulanic acid and sulbactam were 4.4 and 940 nM, respectively. DNA hybridization studies indicated that this enzyme, designated TEM-10, is related to well-established TEM-type beta-lactamases. However, the TEM-10 enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, in contrast to TEM-2 beta-lactamase. On the basis of substrate and inhibition profiles, the TEM-10 enzyme could be easily discriminated from TEM-5 and RHH-I beta-lactamases.\r"

One week following infection, groups of rabbits were treated with benzathine penicillin (200,000 U intramuscularly weekly for 2 weeks) or cefmetazole (20 or 40 mg/kg per day intramuscularly in four divided doses for 15 days); one group was untreated. Daily dark-field microscopic examination of lesion aspirates demonstrated that the mean times to dark-field negativity were the same for benzathine penicillin- and two cefmetazole-treated groups (1.0. 1.0, and 1.17 days, respectively), while all untreated animals remained dark-field positive for greater than 15 days. Mean maximum lesion diameters in cefmetazole-treated animals (8.7 +/- 1.3 and 8.1 +/- 1.3 mm) were equivalent to those in penicillin-treated animals (8.6 +/- 1.6 mm) and were smaller than observed in untreated animals (12.4 +/- 2.2 mm; P less than 0.01); fewer lesions ulcerated in penicillin- or cefmetazole-treated rabbits than in untreated rabbits (P less than 0.001).

For (S)-HPMPDAP, the EC50 was 2.3 microM and the EC90 was 36 microM. Most combinations of AZT and PMEA produced a synergistic effect. In the T-cell line C3, the combination indices for 50 to 90% inhibition of virus replication ranged from 0.25 to 1.25. Combinations of PMEA (or other members of this group) with AZT appear to be worth further study for the possible treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

The diameter of the nanoparticles was 187 +/- 13 nm, and the ampicillin/PIHCA ratio was 0.2/1. The proportion of ampicillin bound was 90 +/- 3%. All control mice and all those treated with nonloaded nanoparticles died within 10 days of infection. By contrast, all mice treated with a single injection of 0.8 mg of nanoparticle-bound ampicillin survived. With free ampicillin, a similar curative effect required three doses of 32 mg each. Lower doses delayed but did not reduce mortality. The sharp increase in the therapeutic index of ampicillin after linkage to PIHCA nanoparticles was explained by studies of the distribution of ampicillin, which showed that when bound to nanoparticles, the ampicillin was concentrated mainly in the liver and spleen, the primary foci of infection in the experimental model that we used. These findings warrant further development of intracellular targeting of antibiotics on biodegradable polymeric carriers such as PIHCA.\r"

CD2F1 mice injected intravenously with 3 x 10(5) Candida albicans cells were treated with either single- or multiple-dose regimens. Untreated infected mice had a median survival of 7 days, with all mice dead by 12 days. Single doses of AMB resulted in a median survival range from 18 to 23.5 days, with less than or equal to 38% survival by day 42. Single doses of lip-AMB resulted in 88 to 100% survival by day 42. The multiple-dose AMB regimen provided median survival of only 30 to 33 days, with less than or equal to 38% survival by day 42. The multiple-dose lip-AMB regimen resulted in greater than 90% survival by day 42. With single-dose regimens, lip-AMB levels in plasma were severalfold higher than AMB levels in plasma. By 10 h, at equivalent doses, lip-AMB levels in plasma were much higher, whereas AMB levels in plasma were not detectable. Compared with normal values, the blood urea nitrogen, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were not significantly altered by high doses of lip-AMB treatment. Viable C. albicans was recoverable from the kidneys of some of the lip-AMB-treated mice at day 42.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the possibility that tet expression increases aminoglycoside susceptibility by increasing bacterial uptake of aminoglycoside. Studies of [3H]gentamicin uptake in paired sets of Escherichia coli HB101 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 expressing and not expressing tet showed that tet expression accelerates energy-dependent [3H]gentamicin uptake. Increased [3H]gentamicin uptake was accompanied by decreased bacterial protein synthesis and bacterial growth. Increased aminoglycoside uptake occurred whether tet expression was constitutive or induced, whether the tet gene was class B or C, and whether the tet gene was plasmid borne or integrated into the bacterial chromosome. tet expression produced no measurable change in membrane potential, suggesting that tet expression increases aminoglycoside uptake either by increasing the availability of specific carriers or by lowering the minimum membrane potential that is necessary for uptake.\r"

Subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catQ, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial Sau3A fragment. The catQ gene contained internal HindII, HaeIII, and DraI restriction sites and was distinct from the catP gene, which was originally cloned (L. J. Abraham, A. J. Wales, and J. I. Rood Plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative C. perfringens R plasmid, pIP401. Hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb DraI-P fragment of pJIR260 as an internal catQ-specific probe and a 0.38-kb EcoRV-HinfI fragment of pJIR62 as an internal catP-specific gene probe. The results showed that the catP and catQ genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. However, the catP gene was similar to the cloned catD gene from Clostridium difficile. Comparative studies with both catP and catD probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. We therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.\r"

  ".W": "Preferential cleavage of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes in internucleosomal (linker) regions and nonspecific degradation of chromatin by an anticancer antibiotic which degrades DNA were investigated and found to increase in consecutive stages of growth. Cleavage of DNA in internucleosomal regions and intensities and multiplicities of nucleosomal bands were dependent on drug concentration, growth phase of the cells, and length of incubation. Cellular DNA was least degraded during logarithmic phase. After cells progressed only one generation in logarithmic phase, low concentrations (6.7 x 10(-7) to 3.4 x 10(-6) M) of bleomycin produced approximately three to seven times more DNA breaks. Internucleosomal cleavage was highest, and the most extended oligonucleosomal series and extensive chromatin degradation were observed during stationary phase. It is concluded that the growth phase of cells is critical in determining amounts of the highly preferential cleavage in internucleosomal regions and overall breakage and degradation of DNA. Mononucleosomal bands were most intense, indicating the greatest accumulation of DNA of this size. Mean mononucleosomal lengths were 165.9 +/- 3.9 base pairs, in agreement with yeast mononucleosomal lengths. As high-molecular-weight chromatin was digested by bleomycin, oligonucleosomes and, eventually, mononucleosomes became digested. Therefore, it is also concluded that bleomycin degradation of oligonucleosomes and trimming of DNA linker regions proceed to degradation of the monosomes (core plus linker DNA).\r"

In 10 of 14 patients, macular and papular eruptions occurred in a strikingly similar pattern, at the earliest recovery of peripheral lymphocytes, after chemotherapy-induced nadir of the leukocyte count. A concomitant sharp, transient rise in temperature accompanied the eruption of lymphocyte recovery. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from 8 of these 10 patients and showed a superficial, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate was performed. The rash of lymphocyte recovery may be due to the actual return of immunocompetent lymphocytes to the peripheral circulation and skin after the chemotherapy-induced nadir of the leukocyte count. These observations suggest that macular and papular eruptions relate to specific immunologic events.\r"

We conclude that lymphocytic infiltration of the skin is a single entity. Progression into polymorphous light eruption, discoid lupus erythematosus, or lymphoma was not observed. However, this study shows that lymphocytic infiltration of the skin and polymorphous light eruption cases occur simultaneously in 1 patient. In this study the cases of 10 patients with this combination are reported. An effective but harmless therapy is yet unknown. Intermittent use of topical steroids can be useful but is not effective in many patients.\r"

As our test population consisted of only a few children, no conclusions were drawn in respect to children younger than 10 years.

All patients were followed up for eight months to two years. A final diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux was made in 41 patients, in all of whom the pH study was abnormal (100% sensitivity). The final diagnosis was different in 70 patients; 66 of these had a normal pH (94% specificity). All children with gastro-oesophageal reflux were treated with drugs. All those with a percentage reflux time of more than 27 and more than 20 episodes of reflux lasting more than 5 minutes failed to improve and needed operation. We conclude that monitoring of the oesophageal pH should be the first line of investigation in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux and should be used together with clinical data and other investigations, to identify those children who will need operation.\r"

Taken independently, age, weight, and prematurity were significantly associated with the need for artificial ventilation, weight being the most important factor. Using stepwise logistic regression, prematurity in itself added to the quality of the prediction but age did not. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 105 hours (range 2-381). Duration of ventilation was significantly longer in children with a low gestational age at birth and a positive familial history of atopy.

The average daily fluid intake, weight change, respiratory rate and heart rate before treatment were similar whether or not the infant developed toxicity. A diazoxide toxicity index was obtained by multiplying the dose of diazoxide by the insulin:glucose ratio to relate the diazoxide dose to the severity of the disease. In all instances when the toxicity index was more than 1533 (mean (SD) 3732 (2741) cardiac toxicity developed. In contrast, infants with a toxicity index of less than 675 (mean (SD) 364 (270), had no symptoms of toxicity. Symptoms were significantly related to the severity of the disease and the diazoxide dose. It is possible to use the toxicity index to predict the risk of toxicity and to calculate a safe dose of diazoxide in infants with persistent neonatal hyperinsulinism.\r"

Those receiving daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate who were in first remission 20 months from diagnosis were divided into two groups on the basis of whether or not they had ever had an absolute neutrophil count of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/l recorded during maintenance treatment up to that time. Of 105 evaluable children, 45 (43%) became neutropenic at least once, and 60 (57%) did not. Seven (16%) of the neutropenic group subsequently relapsed compared with 27 (45%) of the remainder. This difference was still significant if the analysis was stratified by total treatment time (two or three years), age, sex, or diagnostic white cell count. Seven (16%) neutropenic children died in remission, compared with one (2%) of the non-neutropenic children. Therapeutic myelosuppression during standard maintenance treatment of 'standard risk' lymphoblastic leukaemia is associated with increased toxicity but a reduced risk of relapse. The unexplained improvement in long term survival in the United Kingdom in recent years may in large part be due to this.\r"

The refinery workers reported more nose and eye irritation, indigestion, stomach pain, and fatigue than controls. \"Garlic-like\" breath odor was reported to be personally and socially offensive by many of the workers. Reporting of symptoms, pulmonary function indices, and laboratory test results did not change with exposure except for hemoglobin level, which rose during the shutdown. Hemoglobin levels were found to be inversely correlated with the urine selenium level, and there was a positive correlation noted for the interactive effect of urine selenium and urine arsenic levels on hemoglobin.\r"

Except for lung damage, no significant adverse effects of ESWL of gallbladder stones have been observed in animals. In clinical use ESWL of gallbladder stones is now confined to 15% to 30% of symptomatic patients. To achieve complete stone clearance, ESWL of gallbladder stones must be supplemented by an adjuvant therapy. ESWL of bile duct stones is highly effective and can be considered in patients in whom primary endoscopic or surgical stone removal fails. Second generation lithotriptors allow anesthesia-free (outpatient) treatments, but the clinical experience with most of these ESWL devices is still limited. The likelihood of gallbladder stone recurrence is a major disadvantage of ESWL treatment, which raises the issue of cost-effectiveness. ESWL for cholelithiasis is a promising treatment modality with good short-term and unknown long-term results.\r"

  ".U": "90055421\r", 
  ".W": "A consecutive series of 352 attacks of acute pancreatitis (AP) was studied prospectively in 318 patients. AP was ascertained by contrast-enhanced CT scan in all but four cases in which diagnosis was made at operation or autopsy. Sixty-seven of these cases (19%) had normal serum amylase levels on admission (i.e., less than 160 IU/L, a limit that includes 99% of control values), a figure considerably higher than generally admitted. When compared to AP with elevated serum amylase, normoamylasemic pancreatitis was characterized by the following: (1) the prevalence of alcoholic etiology (58% vs. 33%, respectively, p less than 0.01), (2) a greater number of previous attacks in alcoholic pancreatitis (0.7 vs. 0.4, p less than 0.01); and (3) a longer duration of symptoms before admission (2.4 vs. 1.5 days, p less than 0.005). In contrast AP did not appear to differ significantly in terms of CT findings, Ranson's score, and clinical course, when comparing normo- and hyperamylasemic patients, although there was a tendency for normoamylasemic patients to follow milder courses. Serum lipase was measured in 65 of these normoamylasemic cases and was found to be elevated in 44 (68%), thus increasing diagnostic sensitivity from 81% when amylase alone is used to 94% for both enzymes. A peritoneal tab was obtained in 44 cases: amylase concentration in the first liter of dialysate was greater than 160 IU/L in 24 cases (55%), and lipase was greater than 250 U/L in 31 cases (70%). Twelve of these 44 cases had low peritoneal fluid and plasma concentrations for both enzymes. Thus little gain in diagnostic sensitivity was obtained when adding peritoneal values (96%) to serum determinations. AP is not invariably associated with elevated serum amylase. Multiple factors may contribute to the absence of hyperamylasemia on admission, including a return to normal enzyme levels before hospitalization or the inability of inflamed pancreases to produce amylase. Approximately two thirds of cases with normal amylasemia were properly identified by serum lipase determinations. AP does not appear to behave differently when serum amylase is normal or elevated, and should therefore be submitted to similar therapeutic regimens in both conditions.\r"

Yet little is known about specific functions of the transplants compared to the normal spleen. The goal of this study was to get more information about immunologic functions and protein expression in splenic transplants. As an animal model we used the pig, whose splenic morphology and immunoarchitecture is similar to that of the human spleen. Histologic examination of transplants revealed structures that were comparable to normal spleens (consisting of red and white pulp and including germinal centers). Immunologic tests such as the hemolytic plaque assay and mitogen stimulation revealed that the number of plaque-forming cells was not changed significantly, but the stimulation index for T cells was drastically increased in the autotransplants. Electrophoresis and immunochemical methods showed differences in the protein patterns between both tissues. Several proteins were found to be produced only in the spleen, or were produced in much higher amounts in the spleen than in the splenic transplants. More information about these differences between spleen and splenic transplants is needed before we can recommend a general clinical application of autologous spleen transplantation.\r"

One twin died of septicemia at age 2 years after bilateral pelvic osteotomies for the treatment of her marked pelvic diastasis. The surviving twin has done reasonably well, and her most significant problem is related to her musculoskeletal system. She has an increasing T7-10, L-1 apex right congenital scoliosis with wedged vertebra at T-10, as well as marked pubic diastasis and bilateral subluxation of her hips. This has resulted in a somewhat aberrant physical appearance and a \"waddling\" gait. Her colostomy functions well and she has normal renal and bladder function. This patient's history illustrates that many problems remain after successful separation of conjoined twins. However these problems are manageable and do not preclude the possibility that such a patient may be a productive member of society.\r"

Today we live in an era of diagnostic and therapeutic methods based on catheters: observation, aspiration, drainage, stretching, and manipulation by means of relatively atraumatic tubes. The development of catheter techniques has spawned undreamed-of specialties, industries, and professional societies. Although catheters had been used before then in research laboratories, Furman's clinical application of electrode-tipped venous catheters in treating patients with complete heart block and Stokes-Adams seizures represents a turning point. This advance may be regarded as the catalytic and seminal event for the growth of catheter technologies, which are so prominent in the world of medicine today, and their application to many fields of medicine and surgery.\r"

Blood pressure was measured using the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program protocol. Retinopathy was determined from stereoscopic fundus photographs. In the younger-onset group, comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of systolic blood pressure, the relative risk for developing any diabetic retinopathy was 1.8 and for diastolic blood pressure it was 1.2; for progression of diabetic retinopathy, it was 1.1 and 1.3 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. After controlling for other risk variables, systolic blood pressure remained a significant predictor of the incidence of diabetic retinopathy; diastolic blood pressure was of borderline significance in predicting progression in the younger-onset group. Blood pressure was not related to incidence or progression of retinopathy either in the older-onset group using insulin or the older-onset group not using insulin.\r"

  ".W": "In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel study, the antihypertensive effects of betaxolol (20 mg once daily) and/or chlorthalidone (25 mg once daily) were analyzed in 186 patients with essential hypertension. Following a 2- to 4-week placebo baseline period, patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups (betaxolol or chlorthalidone) and studied for 6 weeks while receiving single therapy and an additional 6 weeks with a combination of the two agents. Significant decreases from baseline supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) were observed in both groups at the end of the single-therapy phase (11 mm Hg in SDBP for betaxolol and 12 mm Hg in SDBP for chlorthalidone); a further significant decrease (7 mm Hg for betaxolol and 8 mm Hg for chlorthalidone in SDBP) was observed from the end of the single-therapy phase to the end of the combination-therapy phase. Changes in supine systolic blood pressure (SSBP) from baseline to the end of the single-therapy phase were 10 mm Hg for the betaxolol and 16 mm Hg for the chlorthalidone group. In all cases, within-group changes were statistically significant. From the end of single therapy to end of combination therapy there was an additional 14-mm Hg and 13-mm Hg reduction in SSBP in the betaxolol and chlorthalidone groups, respectively. Overall, 89% of the randomized patients completed the single-treatment phase (phase I), and 89% of those patients completed the combined therapy phase (phase II). There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the clinical response rate (SDBP at or below 90 mm Hg or a decrease from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg). A substantial percentage of patients completing phase I responded to either single agent (58% for betaxolol and 65% for chlorthalidone). Among patients completing phase II therapy, the combination of the two agents produced a greater response rate (83% for the betaxolol-first group and 85% for the chlorthalidone-first group). In conclusion, both agents were effective and well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events in the single-therapy phase were headache, arthralgia, and dizziness, while bradycardia, rhinitis, arthralgia, and dizziness were most frequent in the combination-therapy phase. The combination of betaxolol (20 mg) and chlorthalidone (25 mg) once daily produced an additive antihypertensive effect regardless of which drug was administered first.\r"

Seventeen relapses were observed and all were preceded by a significant rise of the ACPA titer. Anticytoplasmic antibodies are a specific and sensitive marker for active WG; a rising titer is a sensitive marker for the development of a relapse.\r"

The average age at onset was 63 years (range, 24 to 85 years), and women outnumbered men 3 to 1. Tardive dyskinesia was the most common movement disorder (n = 10 [63%]). Five patients had metoclopramide-induced parkinsonism, 1 patient had tardive dystonia, and 1 patient had akathisia. The average duration of exposure prior to onset of movement disorders was 12 months (range, 1 day to 4 years). Therapy was continued for an average of 6 months (range, 1 day to 2 years) after the onset of symptoms, reflecting clinical nonrecognition of the movement disorder and its relationship to metoclopramide. To prevent persistent and disabling movement disorders, long-term use of metoclopramide should be avoided, and patients should be carefully observed for potential neurologic reactions.\r"

The degree of swelling in millimeters was assessed at study introduction and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. At 6 months, the number of patients requiring reaspiration for bursitis recurrence was tabulated. Data at 1 week indicated that patients treated with an intrabursal methylprednisolone acetate injection (20 mg) demonstrated the most rapid decrease in swelling. At 6 weeks, the methylprednisolone-treated groups demonstrated sustained improvement. At 6 months, the mean number of reaspirations per patient for reaccumulation of bursal fluid was higher in groups 3 (1.0 +/- 1.2) and 4 (0.4 +/- 0.7).

Five hundred seventy patients were assessed for an analysis of safety and 461 patients were assessed for an analysis of efficacy. The most common infections were infected ulcers and abscesses. At the end of therapy, there was a higher incidence of recurrent or persistent organisms in the cefotaxime group compared with ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions related to either therapy were rare. By pathogens, there were no differences in activity, except the higher rate of recurrent or persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the cefotaxime group. By diagnosis, the two drugs had comparable efficacy, except for the higher incidence of bacteriologic failure in patients with polymicrobial infected ulcers in the cefotaxime group. Larger studies are needed to evaluate emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin. Oral ciprofloxacin therapy is as safe and effective as parenteral cefotaxime in the treatment of difficult infections of the skin and skin structure, and affords the prospect of early discharge from the hospital and significant cost savings.\r"

The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) (total range, 0 to 40), with separate subtotals for severity of obsessions and compulsions. In a study involving four raters and 40 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder at various stages of treatment, interrater reliability for the total Yale-Brown Scale score and each of the 10 individual items was excellent, with a high degree of internal consistency among all item scores demonstrated with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Based on pretreatment assessment of 42 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, each item was frequently endorsed and measured across a range of severity. These findings suggest that the Yale-Brown Scale is a reliable instrument for measuring the severity of illness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with a range of severity and types of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\r"

Two hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to one of four 16-week treatment conditions: interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, imipramine hydrochloride plus clinical management (as a standard reference treatment), and placebo plus clinical management. Patients in all treatments showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms and improvement in functioning over the course of treatment. There was a consistent ordering of treatments at termination, with imipramine plus clinical management generally doing best, placebo plus clinical management worst, and the two psychotherapies in between but generally closer to imipramine plus clinical management. In analyses carried out on the total samples without regard to initial severity of illness (the primary analyses), there was no evidence of greater effectiveness of one of the psychotherapies as compared with the other and no evidence that either of the psychotherapies was significantly less effective than the standard reference treatment, imipramine plus clinical management. Comparing each of the psychotherapies with the placebo plus clinical management condition, there was limited evidence of the specific effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy and none for cognitive behavior therapy. Superior recovery rates were found for both interpersonal psychotherapy and imipramine plus clinical management, as compared with placebo plus clinical management. On mean scores, however, there were few significant differences in effectiveness among the four treatments in the primary analyses. Secondary analyses, in which patients were dichotomized on initial level of severity of depressive symptoms and impairment of functioning, helped to explain the relative lack of significant findings in the primary analyses. Significant differences among treatments were present only for the subgroup of patients who were more severely depressed and functionally impaired; here, there was some evidence of the effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy with these patients and strong evidence of the effectiveness of imipramine plus clinical management. In contrast, there were no significant differences among treatments, including placebo plus clinical management, for the less severely depressed and functionally impaired patients.\r"

Comorbidity of panic disorder with major depression, agoraphobia, and alcohol or other drug abuse did not explain these findings. The social and health consequences of panic disorder (quality of life) should be considered, as risks and benefits of currently available acute and maintenance treatments are evaluated. Clinical trials of panic disorder, whether of drugs or behavioral treatment, should include quality of life assessments as outcome measures. Long-term prospective studies based on clinical samples of patients with panic disorder are indicated to relate the illness more precisely to social morbidity.\r"

Since it is difficult to predict clinical outcome for patients with paragangliomas, we have emphasized the differences between benign and malignant paragangliomas, concentrating on recent results obtained using immunohistologic techniques. These studies have emphasized the critical importance of the identification, by immunohistologic means, of two distinct cell populations, chief cells (type I) and sustentacular cells (type II). The relationship between these two cell populations, stable in normal glands and benign tumors, is progressively lost in tumors of increasing degrees of malignancy, sustentacular cells being absent from the most progressively metastasizing paragangliomas.\r"

The bleeding time is a useful test for assessing platelet function in patients with hemorrhagic disorders. Its utility in providing helpful clinical information in patients who do not have a known bleeding diathesis by history is minimal. Specific recommendations regarding the rational use of the bleeding time for the preoperative evaluation of patients are presented.\r"

All fine-needle aspirations were assisted to ensure adequate cellularity, and were examined by a multimodal approach that included the preparation of B-5-formaldehyde-fixed cell blocks by the plasmathrombin technique. alpha-Fetoprotein was positive in four of eight HCCs, including the one example of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, but negative in the one case of pure cholangiocarcinoma and all cases of metastatic carcinoma. Carcinoembryonic antigen positivity was noted in four HCCs, a high proportion of metastatic adenocarcinomas, and occasional metastatic squamous cell carcinomas, but not in the one example of cholangiocarcinoma. Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in only two cases of HCCs, but not in any metastatic tumors. Keratin and vimentin were positive, respectively, in four and three HCCs, and a variable proportion of metastatic carcinomas often coexpressed both antigens. Epithelial membrane antigen was positive in five of the eight HCCs. Our findings are consistent with the view that alpha-fetoprotein and hepatitis B surface antigen are reliable markers for HCC. However, none of the immunocytochemical markers reliably distinguished the primary site of metastatic carcinoma. The intensity of the immunostains in the fine-needle aspirations was comparable with that observed in tissues, but fragmentation of cell groups interfered with interpretation. Multiple passes and verification of the cellularity of the aspirates are crucial factors for the success of this approach to diagnosis.\r"

We have attempted to identify the mechanism of this phenomenon by testing the modulatory effects of isolated mannan and the chemical catabolites of mannan on cell-mediated immune function in vitro. We have determined that mannan isolated by complexation with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is more antigenic than mannan isolated by precipitation with copper and that CTAB mannan does not inhibit lymphoproliferation stimulated by another antigen. We have also determined that oligosaccharides of three sizes, derived by chemical catabolism of CTAB mannan, are not antigenic, but instead are immunoinhibitory. Immunoinhibition does not involve interference with the mitogenic activity of interleukin 2. A similar occurrence of oligosaccharides may be produced by catabolism of mannan in vivo as evidenced by the presence of oligosaccharides of similar size in cell-free supernatant fluids derived from mononuclear leukocytes incubated with tritiated mannan. We propose that catabolites of fungal mannan may contribute significantly to suppression of cell-mediated immunity in candidiasis.\r"

The postembolization changes of the gallbladder were studied by regular follow-up with ultrasonography. Twenty-four patients (10.7%) were found to have an acute infarction of the gallbladder within two weeks immediately following chemoembolization. Gallbladder infarction was related to inadequate superselectivity, regurgitation of chemoembolus, or unavoidable anatomic limitations. Four of the 24 patients were found to have delayed formation of gallstones, with the time lapses after TAEs being 2, 2, 3, and 5 months, respectively. One patient underwent surgical reexploration for cholecystectomy 14 months after resection of her HCC because of intractable symptoms and signs of chronic cholecystitis. There are four possible mechanisms of development of gallstones. Cholecystectomy should be performed during the elective hepatectomy for resectable HCC in patients who have received preoperative TAEs.\r"

We were not able to demonstrate clinical differences between groups, either during the 10-day treatment period or at follow-up examination a mean of 7.7 months after antibiotic therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid cefotaxime concentrations reached the minimum inhibitory concentration at the 90% level for Borrelia burgdorferi in all patients, while none of the patients treated with penicillin G had cerebrospinal fluid concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration at the 90% value. We conclude that patients with acute neurologic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis may benefit from a 10-day treatment with cefotaxime or penicillin G. Cerebrospinal fluid antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration at the 90% value, as observed in all patients treated with cefotaxime, offer the most hope for long-term prognosis.\r"

The concentration of protein kinase C-like immunoreactivity was reduced in Alzheimer's disease samples, although the protein kinase C activity determined by the phosphorylation of exogenous histone was not. The degree of in vitro phosphorylation of an Mr 79,000 protein in the presence of protein kinase C activators was less in Alzheimer's disease than in control fibroblast cytosol, and a reduction was more prominent in cases of familial Alzheimer's disease than in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the aberrant phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C is found not only in the brain but also in fibroblasts.\r"

Recent advances in neuronal transplantation and molecular techniques underlying nerve growth are discussed. Possible therapeutic approaches are presented for many neurologic disorders, ranging from stroke to Alzheimer's disease to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, based on regrowing or saving injured neurons. The clinical neurologist will become important in practical applications and research into prolonging neuronal survival and fostering axonal regeneration. Over the coming years, with further research, it is anticipated that patients will be treated with these or similar modulatory agents.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of human B cell responses is a complex process that involves the activities of a variety of cytokines. There are important differences between the regulation of human and murine B lymphocytes, especially with regard to the action of IL-2. In humans, IL-2 appears to play a central role in regulating B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, thereby facilitating the production of immunoglobulins of all isotypes. A wide array of additional cytokines can amplify antibody production, but none appears to be able to do this in the absence of IL-2; moreover, none appears to enhance the production of only a single isotype of immunoglobulin. Beyond the positive influences of cytokines on B cell responses, at least 2 cytokines, IL-4 and TGF beta, suppress B cell proliferation and differentiation. Inhibition by each of these cytokines can be overcome by specific cytokines that provide positive signals to B cells. Antibody production is thus regulated by a complex array of cytokines with complementary or opposing effects that may be exerted at different stages of B cell responsiveness. Whether specific subpopulations of B cells exhibit unique cytokine requirements for differentiation has not been clearly delineated, nor is it clear whether autoantibody production is uniquely regulated by cytokines. Additional information concerning the role of cytokines in the regulation of B cell function should provide further insight not only into normal antibody production, but also into potential dysregulation that leads to autoimmunity.\r"

Recently, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been identified as a pluripotent mediator of inflammatory and immunologic responses and the major hepatocyte-stimulating factor. In this study, we demonstrated that monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, and to a lesser extent, hydroxyapatite crystals, increased IL-6 production by synoviocytes and monocytes in vitro. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that MSU and CPPD crystals, but not hydroxyapatite crystals, were able to increase the release of newly synthesized IL-6. Crystal-induced IL-6 stimulated acute-phase protein synthesis, immunoglobulin production, and hybridoma cell proliferation, which was neutralized by a specific antibody to IL-6. High levels of IL-6 were found in synovial fluid from patients with gout and pseudogout. These results demonstrate that MSU and CPPD crystals can induce IL-6 production in synoviocytes and monocytes, and that synovial fluid from patients with gout and pseudogout contains high levels of IL-6. Crystal-induced IL-6 is likely to be an important mediator of inflammatory responses in acute gout and pseudogout.\r"

We report the case of a young man who developed a neuropathy following disulfiram administration, with a virtually complete recovery in 14 months. We then discuss 37 cases of disulfiram neuropathy reported since 1971. Evidence is given that: (1) there is no numerical sex prevalence, although the incidence of the disease in women is probably disproportionately high; (2) symptom onset latency is dose-dependent, being longer at 250 mg/day or less; (3) neurological deficits are also dose-dependent, being milder at 250 mg/day or less; (4) the two previous findings and single observations suggest that disulfiram neuropathy is a dose-dependent phenomenon; (5) recovery probably follows a course which depends primarily on the initial degree of impairment; (6) the genetic mechanism probably involves carbon disulfide and a hypothesis as to the possible biochemical mechanism is proposed; (7) chloral hydrate can bear a potentiation effect on neuropathy, and the association with disulfiram is best avoided. Further, we give guidelines for the differentiation between alcoholic and disulfiram neuropathy, advise prescribing the drug at 250 mg daily or less, if possible, and stress the utmost importance of an early diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Under normal conditions glomerular blood flow and glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and hydrostatic pressure gradient are regulated within a narrow range in spite of variations in volume status and blood pressure. Glomerular ultrafiltration rate is normally regulated by the hydrostatic pressure gradient, the systemic oncotic pressure, the rate of nephron plasma flow and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. Although the process of glomerular ultrafiltration is driven by the hydrostatic pressure gradient (delta P), regulation of nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) is not mediated by changes in hydrostatic pressure and the correlation between SNGFR and delta P is very poor. There are certain clinical experimental models in which the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient is elevated. These models have been: (1) subtotal nephrectomy model, a model of reduced renal mass, (2) glomerular immune induced injury or glomerulonephritis, (3) most models of systemic hypertension, and (4) certain stages of experimental diabetes mellitus, but the mechanisms vary among the conditions. In most of these clinical models the increase in delta P is associated with a reduction in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. It is also clear that superimposition of hypertension upon models of glomerular immune injury and radical subtotal nephrectomy cause progression of renal dysfunction and glomerulosclerosis. One of the contributing factors to this progression appears to be the elevation in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and pressure gradient. However, other factors have been suggested to play a significant role, such as compensatory hypertrophy and possibly the neurohumoral environment. Therapy of systemic hypertension and administration of cardiovascular drugs which alter glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure may then modify the rate of progresswion of these disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pindolol, as well as so called cardioselective beta-blockers and labetalol, alter renal hemodynamics only slightly, if not at all. In some studies, nadolol has been shown to increase RPF, leaving GFR unchanged. A new beta-blocker, tertatolol, seems to consistently increase RPF and GFR. These different renal actions of various beta-blockers are poorly explained. They may be, however, of clinical significance, in the short term for patients with already impaired renal function, and possibly over the long term for other hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "With a few notable exceptions, beta-receptor ligands (agonists and antagonists) belong to the aryl- or heteroaryl-ethanolamine series and to the aryl- or heteroaryl-oxypropanolamine series. Structure-activity relationships for beta-adrenergic agonists show that a secondary amine in the phenylethanolamine side chain ending is essential for receptor stimulation. The 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl groups may be replaced by \"phenol equivalents\" (-CH2OH, -NHCONH2, -CHOH, -NHSO2CH3). In contrast, substitution at carbon alpha of the phenyl-ethanolamine side chain decreases or suppresses beta-adrenergic activity. The general requirements for beta-adrenergic blocking activity in the aryl- or heteroaryl-oxypropanolamine are as follows: (1) the potency of beta-blockade is conferred by a branched alkyl group (isopropyl or tert-butyl) grafted on the terminal amino N, and by the nature and position of a substituent on the aromatic ring: ortho-substituted compounds (especially when they have an hetero-atom in alpha) are the most potent ones. (2) The cardioselectivity is improved by the attachment of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethyl,4-amide-substituted phenoxyethyl or acylamino-alkyl moieties to the terminal amino N of the side chain. Para substitution on the aromatic ring (particularly 4-acylamido substitution) has also yielded cardioselective drugs. Finally, the beta 1-selectivity is strongly and negatively correlated with lipophilicity. (3) Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can be modulated by aromatic nucleus variations, particularly by hydroxyl-equivalents (electron withdrawing groups) on meta- and para-positions (3,4-substitutions).\r"

  ".W": "The diverse effects of the catecholamines (CA), epinephrine and norepinephrine, are mediated by a family of specific receptors (adrenergic receptors, AR). The beta-AR is a glycoprotein present in the membrane of a number of cell types. This receptor is closely associated with at least two other proteins, guanine nucleotide stimulating protein (Gs) and adenylate cyclase enzyme (AC), to form the beta-AR complex. The beta-AR recognizes the CA and is coupled to Gs which stimulates the effector enzyme AC. This enzyme converts ATP to cAMP and is the effector of the beta-AR complex. Thus the beta-AR is a G-coupled receptor which acts by raising intracellular levels of cAMP. The beta-AR is an important site of regulatory modifications through a variety of mechanisms. The best characterized is known as homologous desensitization: when the receptor is exposed to repeated stimuli by the agonist (CA), its responsiveness wanes, probably to compensate this potentially dangerous overstimulation. The gene for mammalian beta 2-AR has recently been cloned and the predicted amino acid sequence now opens the field to identification of the protein structures involved in receptor functions. The beta 2-AR protein is characterized by the presence of seven membrane spanning regions. The study of the structure, function and regulation of the beta-AR will extend our knowledge of the role of beta-AR in pathological conditions and suggest new therapeutic approaches.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This is related to the accumulation of nonspecific cardiovascular risk factors in this population, aggravated by some specific features, proper to chronic uremia. The principal abnormalities observed in ESRD patients, with no history of cardiovascular disease, consist in an increased left ventricular mass and a chronic left ventricular dilation. The enlargement of the ventricular cavities is due to a chronic flow overload in which the anemia and dialysis arteriovenous fistula play a dominant role. The increase in ventricular mass is usually less pronounced than the ventricular dilation and for a given arterial pressure the ventricular mass-to-volume ratio is inadequately low. The \"inadequate\" cardiac hypertrophy is more frequently observed in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and results in a chronic increase in ventricular stress and oxygen consumption. On the other hand, ESRD patients with aluminum overload exhibit an increased ventricular mass which compensates for ventricular dilation. The echocardiographic indices of ventricular systolic function are normal, contrasting with a pronounced impairment of diastolic properties. The impairment of ventricular filling is in part related to the increased left ventricular mass.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease and this increases with increasing age. It is a chronic disease which affects a quarter of the adult population. On its own or in conjunction with other risk factors, especially cigarette smoking, hypertension is associated with serious morbidity and high mortality. A large number of clinical trials have been undertaken to assess the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in controlling high blood pressure and in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. These trials have studied more than 40,000 subjects worldwide as a result of which the benefits of treatment even in milder forms of hypertension are well established today. However, antihypertensive therapy has been disappointingly unsuccessful in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease despite the undoubted protection against malignant phase hypertension, heart failure, stroke and renal failure as demonstrated in the early Veterans Administration trial and subsequent studies. The success of post-infarction beta-blockade suggested that the wider use of beta-blockers prophylactically might limit hypertension-related coronary disease. Taking into account the adverse and metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers together with calcium channel blockers must remain the drugs of choice as step one therapy in most patients with hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Tertatolol has been studied in 2,338 patients with mild to moderate hypertension over a one year period. Tertatolol (T) was initiated alone (5 mg once daily) and if satisfactory control of blood pressure (BP) (diastolic BP less than 95 mm Hg) was not achieved, treatment was adapted at the third or sixth month either by increasing the dosage (heart rate greater than 70 beats/min), or by adding a potassium-sparing diuretic (heart rate less than or equal to 70 beats/min). Blood pressure normalization was achieved in 88.8% of the study population: 66.1% on single and 22.7% on dual therapy. The decrease of diastolic BP was 18.4 mm Hg (from 102.8 +/- 0.2 to 84.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg, P less than .001). Tertatolol alone or associated with diuretic (T + D) induced a significant and continuous decrease in supine systolic and diastolic BP. Overall side effects were rare, leading in only 6.5% of the cases to the discontinuation of the drug. Plasma creatinine significantly decreased in the single therapy group only (from 92.2 +/- 0.5 to 90.1 +/- 0.5 mumol/L, P less than .01). In patients with initial plasma creatinine greater than or equal to 100 mumol/L (n = 661), plasma creatinine markedly decreased (-10%, from 114.6 +/- 0.7 to 103.4 +/- 0.8 mumol/L, P less than .01), and to the same extent with T or T + D. Thus, this large-scale study confirms that tertatolol is an efficient and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug, which improves renal function, especially when initially reduced.\r"

The study was carried out in 230 patients (96 men, 134 women, mean age +/- standard error of the mean: (51.5 +/- 0.7 years) suffering from uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension. After a one-month placebo run-in period (M0-M1) and a one-month double-blind placebo-controlled period (M1-M2), 213 patients entered and 166 completed the one-year open period (M2-M14). A diuretic (D) was added if blood pressure (BP) was inadequately controlled with the single therapy. After one year, 88.5% of patients were controlled (sitting diastolic BP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg): 56.3% on single therapy (T) and 32.2% on dual therapy (T + D), respectively. Statistical analysis performed on the controlled subjects showed that patients who were controlled with T alone had an initially lower standing diastolic BP and a higher standing heart rate, were younger and had a lower sitting systolic BP than those controlled with T + D. Using such discriminant parameters which are predictors, 83.5% patients (single therapy group) and 49% patients (dual therapy group) were classified in the therapeutic group to which they really belonged. This study confirms the antihypertensive efficacy of tertatolol, and highlights relevant parameters for a successful single beta-blocker therapy in clinical practice.\r"

In a prospective study, 253 aspirations were performed on head and neck masses by the otolaryngology service. Specimens were interpreted independently by two cytopathologists (V.J.S. and P.Z.), and interpretations were compared with the surgical histopathologic diagnosis when available. The interobserver variability between cytopathologists was 8% with a specificity of 96% and a sensitivity of 97%. We conclude that fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and useful tool in the diagnosis of head and neck masses. In the diagnosis of epithelial cysts and squamous epithelial malignancies, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is as accurate as open biopsy.\r"

We showed that IL-6 does not induce CSF production by these cells. Neither addition of exogenous IL-6 nor neutralization of endogenous production of IL-6 by an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) diminished the IL-1-induced colony-stimulating activity (CSA), indicating that IL-6 did not act synergistically with IL-1. Finally, IL-6 did not influence the kinetics of IL-1-induced CSA production by human fibroblasts.

We studied the immunophenotype of RS cells with a recently developed plastic section immunohistochemical technique on acetone-fixed tissues that affords superior morphological detail while preserving a wide variety of lymphoid differentiation antigens. Nineteen cases of HD [16 nodular sclerosing (NS), 2 mixed cellularity (MC), and 1 lymphocyte depleted (LD)] were embedded in plastic and stained for pan-B, pan-T, and various T-subset markers, as well as leukocyte common antigen (CD45), interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (CD25), and RS cell markers CD15 and CD30. RS cells were positive for CD45, CD15, CD30, and CD25, except for 3 cases (2 NS, 1 MC) that were CD15 negative and 2 cases (NS) that were CD45 negative. In 10 cases (NS), RS cells were positive for at least two pan-T-cell markers and CD4; pan-B cell markers were uniformly negative. RS cells in 6 cases (3 NS, 2 MC, 1 LD) were positive for at least one T-cell marker (CD2) and one B-cell marker (CD22). Two cases of NSHD showed no T- or B-cell marking. These data provide further evidence that RS cells in some cases of NSHD have T-cell phenotypes and that RS cells are not homogeneous in their immunoreactivity.\r"

Seven of 13, or 54% of patients with bcr/abl rearrangement negative chronic phase CML (atypical CML) harbored mutations in ras, however. This high incidence of ras mutations, together with the absence of bcr/abl rearrangement, provides evidence that atypical CML is an entity that is molecularly distinct from common CML. Moreover, the clinical characteristics and the high frequency of ras mutations suggest that atypical CML may constitute a subset of the myelodysplastic syndrome and may be best classified as a variant of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).\r"

We have recognized a syndrome of hypoxia and hypotension that follows the first but not subsequent doses of rhGM-CSF. Thirteen of 42 patients receiving rhGM-CSF in phase I studies and 4 of 6 patients in a phase II study developed a reaction that occurred after the first dose of 24 of 78 cycles of rhGM-CSF therapy. The reaction was characterized by flushing (16 of 24), tachycardia (16 of 24), hypotension (14 of 24), musculoskeletal pain (13 of 24), dyspnea (12 of 24), nausea and vomiting (11 of 24), rigors (5 of 24), involuntary leg spasms (3 of 24), and syncope (3 of 24). The reaction did not occur after any of more than 600 second and subsequent consecutive rhGM-CSF doses. Oxygen saturation decreased during first-dose reactions by 8% +/- 4% as compared with 3% +/- 1% on first days without reactions (P less than .001) and 2% +/- 1% on subsequent days (P less than .001). Pulmonary dysfunction was characterized by hypoxemia (59 +/- 9 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) that was fully correctable with supplementary oxygen, decreased single-breath carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, and increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (25 +/- 6 to 60 +/- 4 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), but no significant abnormalities on chest roentgenogram or lung perfusion scan. Factors predisposing to reactions were rhGM-CSF dose greater than or equal to 3 micrograms/kg (P less than .01), intravenous (IV) rather than subcutaneous (SC) administration (P less than .05), occurrence of a reaction after the first dose of a previous cycle of rhGM-CSF therapy (P less than .01), and for patients receiving 15 micrograms/kg/d by SC bolus, the presence of lung cancer (P less than .05). Administration of 15 micrograms/kg/d rhGM-CSF by 24-hour SC infusion rather than SC bolus resulted in a delayed onset of reaction from 30 +/- 8 minutes to 240 +/- 190 minutes (mean +/- SD, P less than .001), and a slower rate of initial transient decrease in neutrophil levels and a more prolonged duration of transient leukopenia. The time of onset of reactions correlated with the rate of rise of rhGM-CSF levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on hematologic parameters was evaluated in a phase I clinical study in 18 patients with advanced malignancy. G-CSF was administered once daily as a 30-minute infusion for 14 days; three patients each were treated at increasing dose levels of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 60 micrograms kg-1 day-1. A transient decrease in neutrophil and monocyte counts was observed immediately after the G-CSF infusion, followed by a dose-dependent increase of up to 15-fold. G-CSF-induced neutrophils exhibited an increased O2- radical production, and serum levels of enzymes related to granulocyte turnover, including lysozyme and elastase, were markedly elevated during therapy. A dose-dependent depression of platelet counts occurred in the second third of the treatment course, followed by a spontaneous recovery despite continuing therapy. G-CSF was well-tolerated; minor to moderate bone pain was the most common side effect. The primary course of the malignant diseases studied was not significantly altered. G-CSF appears to be an appropriate means to selectively increase the number of functionally competent polymorphonuclear phagocytes.\r"

Through chemical cross-linking of IL-3 and GM-CSF to KG-1 cells, we identified distinct binding proteins for each of these cytokines with approximate molecular masses of 69 and 93 Kd, respectively. Although these two binding proteins are distinct, GM-CSF and IL-3 compete with each other for binding to KG-1 cells. Other cell lines, which express receptors for either factor but not for both do not display this cross-competition for binding with IL-3 and GM-CSF. These findings imply that distinct IL-3 and GM-CSF binding proteins are expressed on the cell surface and that an association exists between these proteins on KG-1 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, alpha 2 gamma 2) synthesis was previously reported in normal human adult erythroblast colonies (\"bursts\") generated by erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) in fetal calf serum-supplemented (FCS+) semisolid cultures stimulated with erythropoietin (Ep). Our studies focused on the reactivation of HbF synthesis in normal adult erythroid bursts generated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) seeded in FCS+ methylcellulose culture. Reactivation is almost totally suppressed when (a) PBMCs are grown in optimized FCS- culture, or (b) PBMCs are first stringently depleted of monocytes and then plated in FCS+ medium (ie, BFU-E growth in FCS+ Mo- culture). In both experimental conditions, the proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages interspersed among colonies is drastically reduced, and the cloning efficiency of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) progenitors is sharply diminished. In either case, addition of biosynthetic GM colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces a dose-related increase of HbF synthesis up to the level in FCS+ culture, with even more elevated values on delayed addition of Ep. A dose-related increase was also observed in erythroblast clones generated by highly purified BFU-E. These results suggest that reactivation of HbF synthesis in normal adults is at least in part mediated by GM-CSF. Furthermore, they imply intriguing hypotheses on the mechanism(s) of perinatal Hb switching. Finally, they raise the possibility of reactivation of HbF synthesis in beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia by GM-CSF therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to normal and human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was investigated with radiolabeled recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF). In all 14 cases of primary AML specific receptors for G-CSF were demonstrated on purified blast cells. The average numbers of G-CSF receptors ranged from very low to 428 receptors per cell (mean). Normal granulocytes showed G-CSF binding sites on their surface at higher densities (703 to 1,296 sites per cell). G-CSF receptors appeared to be of a single affinity type with a dissociation constant (kd) ranging between 214 and 378 pmol/L for AML blasts and 405 to 648 pmol/L for granulocytes. In 12 of 14 cases, including those with relatively low specific binding, G-CSF was a potent inducer of DNA synthesis of blasts in vitro; therefore, apparently relatively few receptors are required to permit activation of AML cell growth. However, in two cases cell cycling was not activated in response to G-CSF despite G-CSF receptor availability. The results show that G-CSF receptors of high affinity are frequently expressed on the blasts of human AML, but their presence may not be a strict indicator of the proliferative responsiveness of the cells to G-CSF.\r"

The epitope is available for binding in aggressive lymphomas but not in indolent lymphomas or normal cells. An immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody that binds this epitope, Trump, was produced by screening on tumor cells from a patient who initially had a low-grade lymphoma which subsequently converted to a high-grade lymphoma. Immunoprecipitation and comodulation studies show that Trump binds to the TfR, but blocking studies and immunostaining reveal that the TfR epitope seen by Trump is distinct from the OKT9 and anti-TfR binding sites. The ability of Trump to discriminate a separate population of more highly malignant cells suggests that the expression of the Trump epitope is determined by the state of activation or degree of malignancy of the cell. In addition, it may be possible to use the Trump antibody diagnostically or therapeutically in the management of lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) was administered (50 to 800 micrograms/m2) once daily as a half-hour intravenous (IV) infusion for 14 days to seven patients with malignant lymphoma. In all patients, administration of rhG-CSF not only ameliorated the decrease in absolute neutrophil count after the cytotoxic chemotherapy but also enhanced superoxide (O2-) release in neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). The priming effect of rhG-CSF on neutrophil O2- release was rapid (evident within 6.5 hours) and sustained at least for 24 hours after a single IV administration of rhG-CSF. The responsiveness to further in vitro challenge of rhG-CSF was lost or reduced in neutrophils isolated after rhG-CSF treatment, indicating that neutrophils already primed in vivo by rhG-CSF are desensitized to this factor. In contrast to the results obtained with FMLP, when phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used as stimulus, no consistent enhancement of O2- release was observed, suggesting that rhG-CSF modulates the signal transduction pathways linked to FMLP receptors rather than increases the components of the O2- producing enzyme complexes. Administration of rhG-CSF also rapidly (evident within 15 minutes) caused an increase in expression of neutrophil C3bi-receptors that was sustained for at least 24 hours after a single IV administration of rhG-CSF. Pharmacokinetic study of rhG-CSF showed a half-life (t1/2) of 114 min. These findings show that rhG-CSF is a potent activator for neutrophil functions both in vivo and in vitro.\r"

Clinical evidence includes a relation between disease activity and menstrual cycle and a clear decrease in disease activity during pregnancy. A protective effect of oral contraceptives on the development of rheumatoid arthritis is claimed. There are conflicting data with regard to the plasma levels of sex hormones in women with rheumatoid arthritis. In vitro gonadal hormones suppress T-lymphocyte proliferation, while B-lymphocyte differentiation is enhanced by oestrogens and diminished by testosterone. Some pilot studies suggest that oestrogens may ameliorate disease activity in women with active rheumatoid arthritis. Presently we are conducting a randomized, double-blind trial comparing oestrogens with placebo as adjuvant therapy in women with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

None of the patients had been previously treated with a disease modifying drug. In one patient therapy with Lyndiol was stopped within 14 days after the start because of vomiting. Three out of the remaining nine patients stopped the therapy after 3 months because of inefficacy. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) deteriorated during the study.

Earlier studies, both in humans and in experimental models, have convincingly suggested that oestrogen exaggerates lupus disease and enhances autoantibody production in lupus. However, a general effect by oestrogen to stimulate auto-immune disease does not fit with recent findings in human rheumatoid arthritis and in certain experimental autoimmune models. Here it is shown that oestrogen treatment suppresses development of type II collagen induced arthritis in mice and rats, which is a T-cell dependent experimental model for human RA. The oestrogen-mediated effects are obtainable in physiological levels and both incidence and severity of disease can be suppressed. It is demonstrated that oestrogen has a dualistic effect on the immune system by suppressing antigen-specific T-cell dependent immune reactions while enhancing B-cell activities. On these grounds, we suggest that autoimmune diseases should be divided into two groups, one in which oestrogen accelerates disease progression and another in which oestrogen is beneficial.\r"

A total of 30 transducers and scan-heads used with equipment from 10 manufacturers were examined, including a range of array types, mechanical sectors and continuous-wave Doppler transducers. Measurements were made using an infrared radiometer, or a thermocouple probe, with the transducers operating in air. Surface temperatures of 13 transducers operating in imaging mode were found to be in the range 0.0-13.1 degrees C above ambient after 5 min operation. Some transducers operating in pulsed Doppler mode reached considerably higher temperatures. The most extreme example increased the surface temperature by 36.5 degrees C after 1 min and reached a steady-state temperature of almost 80 degrees C. Transducers operating at these temperatures cannot be retained on the skin of a conscious subject without pain, and will cause skin burns within a brief period of time. A linear relationship has been demonstrated between temperature increase and spatial-average acoustic intensity. The rate of increase in air was found to be about 10 times greater for pulsed arrays than for continuous-wave Doppler transducers.\r"

  ".U": "90057978\r", 
  ".W": "The intravenous urogram has long been the mainstay of urinary tract imaging in adult practice. It has been shown recently that in many clinical situations the routine use of intravenous urography is no longer justified and in some situations avoidance of adverse contrast reactions, reduced examination time and significant cost reduction. In order to assess the clinical and financial aspects of a change in practice in our department, a prospective study was undertaken over a total of 10 weeks when 328 patients who were referred for intravenous urography were also examined independently by ultrasound combined with the plain abdominal radiograph. The results were compared and in 81.4% of cases the two techniques yielded identical information. Ultrasound plus a plain abdominal radiograph provided more diagnostic information in a further 12.5% of cases, whilst intravenous urography was more informative in only 6.1%. The findings of the study are discussed by considering the main clinical groups and comparing the relative yields of ultrasound and urography. A scheme of routine urinary tract investigations using ultrasound and the plain abdominal radiograph is proposed. We estimate a 58% reduction in number of urographic examinations while retaining diagnostic accuracy. The financial and planning implications for our department are discussed.\r"

The specimens were randomly arranged and re-read \"blind\" by two pathologists. The interobserver agreement, corrected for chance agreement, was 0.92 (= kappa coefficient). Twenty-three of the 60 suspect parathyroid tumours were verified histologically following surgery. No diagnostic errors were seen but the percentage of insufficient biopsies from suspect parathyroid tumours or surgically verified parathyroid tumours was high (45 and 47%, respectively). We conclude that a reliable tissue diagnosis can be made by ultrasound-guided, fine-needle tissue biopsy. However, when the material is insufficient for histological diagnosis, we recommend the additional use of ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration for cytology or parathyroid hormone determination.\r"

The present study used the unknown bladder volumes of 41 women undergoing gynaecological surgery who required initial urethral catheterisation. The bladder volumes predicted by transvaginal ultrasound were compared with the volumes obtained when the bladder was emptied by urethral catheterisation. The mean accuracy rate was 24% and the optimum range was 50 to 200 ml. The applications of this technique to the measurement of residual urine in clinical practice include the management of women with voiding difficulties and monitoring women who are either self-catheterising or who have indwelling suprapubic catheters.\r"

Transvaginal ultrasound, which is able to measure bladder volumes in women from 2 to 175 ml, provides a means of measuring any fluid volume remaining in the bladder following catheter drainage. Using transvaginal ultrasound, the post-catheterisation bladder volumes were measured in 26 female patients; 14 underwent urethral catheterisation using either a 14F short plastic female catheter or a Foley catheter of the same size (balloon not inflated); 12 had an indwelling 12F suprapublic catheter following bladder neck surgery. The mean post-catheterisation bladder volumes after using the short plastic female and Foley catheters were less than 1 ml and 77 ml respectively. A short plastic catheter should be used in women to collect the residual urine volume by urethral catheterisation. A Foley catheter is relatively ineffective in this task. A 12F suprapubic catheter was found to drain the bladder relatively well. The mean post-catheterisation bladder volume was 35 ml. Prior to removing a suprapubic catheter post-operatively, it is recommended that the residual urine volume (measured using the suprapubic catheter) be checked by measuring the post-catheterisation bladder volume (using either a short plastic catheter or transvaginal ultrasound).\r"

Because laser surgery is more versatile and precise and is freer of complications than conventional surgery it has become widely accepted in ophthalmology over the past 10 years. Applications range from routine procedures in the fundus to recent, more delicate interventions in the cornea. The argon laser is the most widely used to treat extrafoveal chorioretinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy; it has also been used successfully to treat glaucoma by iridectomy or trabeculoplasty. The krypton red laser is the argon laser's counterpart in the treatment of subfoveal and pigment-epithelium-related diseases. Posterior capsulotomy is the most widespread and successful intervention with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet crystal laser; this laser is also used to cut vitreous traction bands and is increasingly used in iridectomy. Although the use of the excimer laser in corneal surgery is still largely investigational it has been shown to produce precise cuts in corneal layers for the correction of myopia or astigmatism. The variable-wavelength dye laser, capable of reaching a specific level in the retina or choroid, has offered exciting new developments, and it promises to soon be part of the ophthalmologist's armamentarium in the treatment of eye disease.\r"

All 26 patients (74%) with responsive or stable disease after induction chemotherapy received intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). Continued responders received additional FUVA as consolidation. The response rate to induction therapy was 54% (with complete response [CR] in 11%). With intensification, three patients (11%) showed improved response (partial response [PR] in one, PR to complete response [CR] in two); however, six patients (23%) progressed within 2 months of cyclophosphamide intensification, three within 1 month. The overall response rate to all three phases of the study was 69%, with CR in 23%. The median survival of all patients entered in this study was 15 months. For cyclophosphamide intensification, major toxicity consisted of leukopenia with fever requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics in 27%. The authors conclude that a single cycle of high-dose cyclophosphamide intensification in metastatic breast cancer does not result in significantly improved responses or prolonged survival.\r"

Among 37 evaluable patients who received DX treatment the overall response rate was 46%, whereas it was 21% in 34 evaluable patients treated with IDA. This difference was statistically significant. In previously untreated patients the response rate with DX was 60% compared to 29% with IDA. Patients with prior chemotherapy had 29% response rate to DX in contrast to 12% with IDA. The median time to response, the median response duration, and the median time to progression were similar in both groups. The median survival of all patients was 20 months in DX arm and 14 months in IDA arm (95% confidence limits 16.69-23.31 and 10.77-17.23, respectively; P = 0.09). Both treatments produced equivalent incidence and severity of myelotoxicity. Gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia were significantly lower in patients receiving IDA. As for cardiotoxicity, four cases of congestive heart failure were recorded among patients treated with DX whereas no cases occurred in the IDA group. The results of this study indicate that, although DX remains the best single agent available in the treatment of breast cancer, IDA may have a role in selected patients with this disease.\r"

Twenty-nine patients with uterine sarcoma who were between 15 and 56 years of age and diagnosed at one of nine centers were matched on age and center to 198 controls selected from hospital admissions to other than obstetric and gynecologic wards. All women were interviewed regarding their medical and reproductive history, methods of birth control, and history of sexual relationships and of sexually transmitted infections. The risk of uterine sarcoma was lower in parous women compared to nulliparous women (odds ratio [OR] = 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1, 3.3), and the risk decreased with increasing number of live births. A greater proportion of cases than controls reported giving birth to their first child at the age of 25 or later, even after adjustment for parity (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.2, 10.9). Cases were also more likely than controls to report a history of a spontaneous abortion (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 0.8, 7.4) or an induced abortion (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 0.4, 6.3). Late menarche and early menopause were both positively associated with the risk of uterine sarcoma. No association was observed with a history of infertility, use of oral contraceptives, or measures of sexual activity. The findings with respect to childbearing and menstrual history differ from those of a recent cohort study, and indicate the need for larger investigations to assess the role of these and other risk factors in the occurrence of sarcomas of the uterus.\r"

To evaluate whether a selected panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to tumor-associated antigens (TAA) can improve the diagnostic potential of FNA, we have immunocytochemically analyzed 122 pulmonary CT-FNA. Whereas conventional cytology was capable of recognizing only the neoplastic nature of the lesions, the immunocytochemical diagnosis could identify the primary or metastatic nature of the pulmonary masses in 92.5% of the cases. The immunocytochemical findings were confirmed by clinical-histopathologic data. The current results demonstrate that the use of immunocytochemical methods can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of conventional cytology of lung masses.\r"

The frequency distribution of the percentage of Ki-67-positive tumor cells in 52 unirradiated carcinomas was gaussian with a mean of 38.7% (range, 7.7% to 75.3%). Analysis of the unirradiated tumors showed no relation between Ki-67 staining and various clinicopathologic features including age, sex, tumor volume, tumor differentiation, location, and tumor stage. Although some tumors demonstrated intratumor heterogeneity of immunoreactivity, there was no significant difference in proliferative activity among peripheral, intermediate, and central tumor areas. Whereas the Ki-67 index increased to 47.1% in recurrent carcinomas, it decreased significantly to 24.7% in rectal carcinomas given radiotherapy before surgery. Therefore, Ki-67 immunostaining might be used as a tool to select and monitor patients with colorectal cancers who might benefit from radiotherapy. The marked differences of Ki-67 expression among different tumors may relate to heterogeneity in growth kinetics and may therefore carry prognostic implications.\r"

Since 1984, eight pelvic ependymomas have been reported that have originated in the ovary, broad ligament, mesovarium, and omentum. This report documents an additional case arising from the right uterosacral ligament in a 48-year-old woman. The diagnosis of ependymoma was supported by a histologic pattern of true rosettes and pseudo-rosettes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positivity, and electron microscopic findings of cilia, blepharoplasts, and intermediate filaments. The tumor was positive for cytokeratin and vimentin. Ultrastructurally, neurosecretory granules were present within the cytoplasm. These features have not been described previously in pelvic ependymomas. These tumors, although easily confused with serous papillary carcinoma, should be distinguished from serous papillary carcinoma because of their apparently better prognosis and tendency for late recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, prospective, comparative study was performed to evaluate induction characteristics, haemodynamic changes and recovery in 60 ASA I-II patients undergoing mainly gynaecological laparotomies with either propofol or thiopentone-enflurane anaesthesia. The propofol group (n = 30) received 2 mg.kg-1 propofol for induction of anaesthesia followed by propofol infusion. The thiopentone-enflurane group (n = 30) received thiopentone 4 mg.kg-1 for induction followed by enflurane (0.5-2 per cent). All patients received nitrous oxide (66 per cent] in oxygen begun one minute after tracheal intubation, and fentanyl (1.5 micrograms.kg-1) four minutes prior to induction. Other drugs administered during or after anaesthesia were similar among the groups. Haemodynamic measurements were similar between propofol and enflurane groups except after tracheal intubation when the mean arterial pressure was lower in the propofol group (P less than 0.05). The propofol group had significantly less (P less than 0.01) emesis in the recovery room than the enflurane group. The propofol group experienced significantly less (P less than 0.05) dizziness, depression/sadness and hunger than the enflurane group in the postoperative period as assessed with a visual analogue questionnaire. We conclude that propofol provided better outcome than enflurane in terms of these nonvital but annoying outcome measures after relatively long intra-abdominal operations.\r"

To prevent such catastrophes, all necessary monitors and equipment should be available, including that needed to deal with a failed intubation. Assessment of the patient may lead to preoperative recognition of a difficult airway; altered positioning may be of help both in recognition and management. Furthermore, adequate assistance, correct use of cricoid pressure, and confirmation of tracheal intubation are fundamental to safe practice. Lastly, should the anaesthetist fail to intubate the patient's trachea, a management protocol is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac lymph from a canine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion was examined for evidence of chemotactic activity. Lymph was continuously collected from awake animals before and during a 60-minute coronary artery occlusion and up to 6 hours after the initiation of reperfusion. It was assessed for the ability to activate the following proinflammatory functions in neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy dogs: 1) morphological changes characteristic of chemotactic stimulation, which were assessed by phase contrast microscopy, 2) orientation of canine neutrophils in a gradient of cardiac lymph, which was assessed in Zigmond chambers, 3) the binding of monoclonal antibodies reactive with CD11b and CD18 adherence glycoproteins, which was assessed by flow cytometry, and 4) adherence of canine neutrophils to monolayers of canine jugular vein endothelium, which was assessed in vitro by a visual assay. Lymph samples collected after 1 hour of reperfusion in animals demonstrating ECG evidence of ischemia and histological evidence of infarction exhibited significant stimulatory activity for each of the functions tested. Shape change-inducing activity was evaluated at more frequent intervals than other functions and was found to peak at 1 hour after initiation of reperfusion and to disappear by 6 hours. In addition, the CD11b/CD18 levels on neutrophils isolated from cardiac lymph collected during reperfusion were significantly greater than neutrophils obtained before or during occlusion. Animals that failed to exhibit evidence of infarction also failed to exhibit increased stimulatory activity in lymph collected during reperfusion, and surface levels of CD11b/CD18 on neutrophils collected from reperfusion lymph were not elevated. This study provides direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that chemotactic activity is generated in ischemic and reperfused myocardium.\r"

  ".U": "90058899\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of glucose and lactate infusion on palmitate oxidation were compared with the effect of 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (TDGA), an irreversible inhibitor of the carnitine acyltransferase I, in normoxic canine myocardium. The initial capillary transit retention fraction of [1-11C]palmitate and its fractional distribution between oxidation and esterification in myocardium were measured by the residue detection method after intracoronary tracer injection, as well as by effluent measurements of 11CO2, the end product of palmitate oxidation. TDGA reduced the initial capillary transit retention fraction (from 56 +/- 13% to 37 +/- 6%; p less than 0.001) and oxidation of palmitate (n = 19), as also evidenced by the decrease in the fraction of tracer released as 11CO2 from 28 +/- 5% to 6 +/- 3% (p less than 0.001). Infusion of carbohydrate (glucose or lactate; n = 6) reduced 11CO2 production from 30 +/- 7% to 7 +/- 4% (p less than 0.05) but did not alter the initial capillary transit retention fraction of tracer (59 +/- 5% vs. 56 +/- 10%; NS). The latter was due to increased esterification into neutral lipids (41 +/- 11% of injected palmitate after carbohydrate infusion versus 21 +/- 12% in control conditions), as measured from multiexponential curve fittings. When carbohydrates were given after inhibition of palmitate oxidation by TDGA (n = 7), the 11C tissue clearance kinetics were strikingly similar to those observed after carbohydrate infusion alone. Thus, enhanced metabolic trapping of [1-11C]palmitate in myocardium resulted in initial capillary transit retention fractions that were not different from control conditions (41 +/- 5% vs. 48 +/- 12%; NS) despite inhibition of oxidation. The results show that the intracellular metabolism of palmitate contributes to the control of its uptake by myocardium. The findings are consistent with inhibition of palmitate oxidation by carbohydrates occurring at the same site as TDGA.\r"

Mean channel fluorescence for both CR1 and CR3 on PMN was significantly higher in IgA N patients than in either control group (p less than 0.01). (CR1 mean +/- SD 42.5 +/- 10.4 in IgA N, 31.7 +/- 11.5 in normal controls, 27.8 +/- 9.0 in non-IgA GN; CR3 94.0 +/- 16.5, 75.0 +/- 16.6 and 76.7 +/- 15.6, respectively.) No differences were found between the two control groups or between IgA N patients with normal and impaired renal function. These results imply that PMN are activated in IgA N patients. The expression of CR1 and CR3 of PMN may be upregulated by immune complexes (ICs), enhancing both phagocytosis of C3b- or iC3b-coated particles, and absorptive pinocytosis of soluble ICs containing C3b or iC3b. Erythrocyte CR1 and CR3 expression was measured by ELISA and found to be slightly but significantly lower in IgA N patients than in the other 2 groups (CR1 85.3 +/- 28.4 in IgA N, 113.1 +/- 28.8 in normal controls, 109.4 +/- 28.2 in non-IgA GN, p less than 0.02; CR3 80.9 +/- 20.0, 100.4 +/- 19.9, 101.2 +/- 24.9, respectively, p less than 0.05).\r"

The femoral component has a proximal wedge shape and a medial collar for proximal press fit and load transfer; anterior and posterior ingrowth pads; anteverted head and neck; and a long, anatomically curved intramedullary stem for distal stability. In testing the contribution of the long, curved stem to the torsional stability of uncemented prostheses by comparing it with other stems, the long, curved stem was the most stable, followed by a shorter straight stem, and a short, proximally curved stem. If the long, and a short, proximally curved stem. If the long, curved stem is incrementally shortened by 1.5-7.5 cm, the initial torsional stability is reduced in proportion to the amount of shortening. Geometrically, for a given patient, the stem-bone contact (and thus the distal stability) is increased when a larger stem is inserted. Clinically, Harris hip scores in 69 hips followed for five to seven years (average patient age, 43.5 years) improved from 52.6 to 92.0 at last follow-up evaluation.

Such an algorithm requires a clear idea of the evolution of the disease process and an understanding of the limitations of each of the modalities by which the disease process can be identified. The role of each of the diagnostic tests available for the diagnosis of ON and the results of prospective evaluations to assess their sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values are reviewed. No single diagnostic test is 100% accurate in the diagnosis of the disease. Thus, one must consider an algorithm that accounts for the variable nature of the disease presentation. The goal of such an algorithm is the accurate identification and staging of the disease. For disease not roentgenographically apparent, an approach using magnetic resonance imaging and bone scanning is recommended. For disease that is apparent roentgenographically, tomography is used to define the extent of the disease and the presence or absence of subchondral fracture. The accuracy of diagnosis is critical to understanding the role of the various treatment modalities prescribed for ON. For this purpose, it is necessary to reach a consensus as to what constitutes a successful outcome of treatment. Once diagnosis of the disease is accepted, clinical success of treatment outcomes should be reported in three ways: by a standard hip rating system, by ability to prevent roentgenographic deterioration, and by survival of the femoral head (the absence of further treatment intervention).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This system objectively analyzes and combines four roentgenographic and clinical risk factors into a single score. Retrospective analysis of metastatic long bone lesions was completed in 78 lesions that had been irradiated without prophylactic surgical fixation. Clinical data and roentgenograms were scored prior to irradiation by independent observers. The outcome identified 51 lesions that did not fracture during the subsequent six months and 27 lesions that fractured within six months. A mean score of 7 was found in the nonfracture group, whereas the fracture group had a mean score of 10. The percentage risk of a lesion sustaining a pathologic fracture could be predicted for any given score. As the score increased above 7, so did the percentage risk of fracture. It is suggested that all metastatic lesions in long bones be evaluated prior to irradiation. Lesions with scores of 7 or lower can be safely irradiated without risk of fracture, while lesions with scores of 8 or higher require prophylactic internal fixation prior to irradiation.\r"

Possible individual differences in the primary osteogenetic activity and the effect of soft-tissue injuries are seldom considered. In recent years, interesting data have revealed how biomechanical forces and electric currents can be translated to biochemical mediators such as prostaglandins (PGE2), morphogens, and growth factors. It is likely that the fracture ends emit osteogenic signal substances (such as bone morphogenetic protein) to the exudate in addition to those mediators (interleukin-1, growth factors) which are released from the blood clot as in wound healing. Movement of the fragments increases the fracture exudate with its migrating cells and sprouting vessels, resulting in exuberant callus. Cartilage is formed in the well-vascularized granulation tissue due to its ability to repel vessels. Rigid fixation minimizes granulation tissue and external callus. Rigid plates may also retard effusion of morphogens and growth factors from bone ends. Reaming of the intramedullary canal and nailing may cause additional bone damage, which may increase the osteogenetic activity. Weight bearing stimulates growth factors and PGE2. The molecular activity of the fracture exudate is the most decisive factor for bone healing. This activity can be impeded by diastasis, infections, and soft-tissue crushing injuries that cause extensive activation of macrophages and activate mediators, disturbing the osteogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were an increasing number of revisions after total hip arthroplasty in Sweden between 1979 and 1986. Male gender and young age increase the risk of revision. The primary diagnosis is very important for type of failure. The risk of deep infection is small but increases with the number of previous operations. Aseptic loosening has emerged as the main problem and is the cause for 74% of all revisions. Prosthetic design is of utmost importance for the rate of failure, and significant differences exist among different prosthesis types with respect to long-term survival. Finally, this MCT has shown that revisions for total hip arthroplasty in patients younger than 70 years of age eventually have failed in Sweden whenever the cemented technique has been used.\r"

Over a 1-month period, there were no significant differences in symptom scores or lung function parameters between the combination of ipratropium bromide and fenoterol and fenoterol alone in a group of children who had asthma.

The subsequent hospital course was complicated by right-sided heart failure and sepsis. With the onset of sepsis, a transient hyperglycemia was noted that required intermittent insulin therapy for 10 days. Hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinism reemerged and responded to diazoxide therapy. An attempt to discontinue diazoxide at age 6 months was aborted at 2 weeks when hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia recurred. The infant required diazoxide for 7 more months, then she recovered without having any sequelae. The review of this uncommon hypoglycemia etiology in an SGA and asphyxiated infant and the merits of long-term diazoxide treatment are discussed.\r"

In the second study only total daily dose and measured drug concentration data were recorded. Dosage and blood sampling time data were assembled retrospectively by assuming strict adherence to protocol guidelines. Comparisons of the results of these analyses demonstrate the marked impact of prospective data collection efforts on data quality and the ability to determine subsequent pharmacokinetic parameters. Analysis of the prospectively collected data yielded pharmacokinetic estimates for alprazolam that were nearly identical to previously reported values obtained according to traditional methods, whereas the analysis of retrospectively collected data yielded biased estimates of the mean pharmacokinetic parameters and markedly upward biased estimates of both interindividual and residual variability. These analyses demonstrate the ability to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters from data collected during clinical efficacy trials, provided that critical issues pertaining to the design and use of data collection forms to enhance data quality and the education of patients and staff are satisfactorily addressed.\r"

Hemodynamic effects were observed with the 2.0 mg dose of MK-912 (peak increase from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure +/- SEM, 14.8/9.2 +/- 2.9/2.1 mm Hg; peak increase in heart rate, 6.3 +/- 2.1 beats/min; p less than 0.05 versus placebo). Plasma concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG, a catecholamine metabolite) were increased 29% +/- 7% and 40% +/- 10% above baseline 2 hours after administration of 1.0 and 2.0 mg MK-912, respectively (p less than 0.01 compared with placebo). A modest dose-dependent reduction (5% to 10%) in fasting plasma glucose concentration was observed 1/2 to 1 hour after administration of 1.0 and 2.0 mg MK-912 (p less than 0.05 compared with placebo), without significant change in plasma insulin values. MK-912 was well tolerated, although it did have a mild anxiogenic effect. MK-912 is a potent, orally active agent with a pharmacologic profile consistent with alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism.\r"

These are some of the risk factors associated with premature atherosclerosis, coronary thrombosis and stroke. It has been proposed that an increased control of metabolism by the 'stress' or counter-regulatory hormones, relative to insulin, is a common feature of these risk factors. Particular emphasis was placed upon the action of the glucocorticoids which can produce insulin insensitivity, leading to hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. Furthermore, glucocorticoids can decrease energy expenditure and, together with insulin, promote energy deposition. These observations provide a partial explanation for the metabolic changes that can accompany the risk factors and clarify why they interact in promoting atherosclerosis.\r"

The effects of endothelin on systemic and renal haemodynamics and plasma concentrations of neuroendocrine hormones including plasma renin activity, aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, catecholamines and arginine vasopressin were investigated in 18 conscious dogs. 2. Bolus injection of 4 pmol of endothelin/kg did not cause any significant changes in haemodynamics. Mean arterial pressure was elevated by both doses of 40 pmol/kg [91 +/- 2 to 99 +/- 2 mmHg (12.1 +/- 0.3 to 13.2 +/- 0.3 kPa), P less than 0.05] or 200 pmol/kg [93 +/- 2 to 107 +/- 3 mmHg (12.4 +/- 0.3 to 14.3 +/- 0.4 kPa), P less than 0.01], the latter dose increasing cardiac output (14%, P less than 0.05) and heart rate (9%, P less than 0.05), and the former reducing these parameters (14% and 8%, P less than 0.05, respectively). 3. In contrast with the various changes in systemic haemodynamics, renal blood flow transiently increased immediately after bolus injection in a dose-dependent manner (28%, P less than 0.05, 50%, P less than 0.01 and 110%, P less than 0.01 with 4, 40 and 200 pmol of endothelin/kg, respectively). This transient elevation of renal blood flow was followed by a gradual decrease (16%, P less than 0.05; 31%, P less than 0.01 and 36%, P less than 0.01) at 10 min. 4.

The sensitivity and specificity of the exercise ECG are not dependent on the prevalence of CAD in the population tested. The positive and negative predictive values of the exercise ECG are both dependent on the prevalence of CAD in the population tested. Exercise-induced ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 1.0 mm is associated with severe myocardial ischemia, left ventricular aneurysm, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, and coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina. Ischemic ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 1.0 mm, exercise duration, maximal exercise heart rate, and blood pressure response to exercise are correlated with new coronary events in patients with documented CAD. Low-level exercise tests within 3 weeks of uncomplicated MI can identify patients at high risk for new cardiac events. Early post-MI patients with exercise-induced ischemic ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 1.0 mm, exercise-induced angina, an inadequate blood pressure response to exercise, or limited exercise duration during a low-level exercise test should undergo coronary angiography and be considered for possible coronary artery surgery or angioplasty. Exercise testing will also help in the medical treatment of patients with exercise-induced angina or malignant ventricular arrhythmias. An exercise test performed 6 months after MI also provides prognostic information not available from clinical evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes may be associated with systolic hypertension secondary to atherosclerosis, renal hypertension secondary to diabetic nephropathy, and essential hypertension. The latter is by far the most prevalent, and a wealth of epidemiologic data suggests that such an association is independent of age and obesity. Considerable evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. Thus, when hypertensive subjects, whether obese or of normal body weight, are compared to age- and weight-matched normotensive controls, a heightened plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is found consistently. A state of cellular resistance to insulin action subtends the observed hyperinsulinism. With the use of the glucose clamp technique coupled with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it can be shown that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (muscle), is limited to nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal, and is directly correlated with the severity of hypertension. The reasons for the association of insulin resistance and essential hypertension can be sought in at least four general types of mechanisms--sodium retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport, and altered muscle fiber composition. Physiologic maneuvers such as caloric restriction in the overweight individual and regular physical exercise can improve tissue sensitivity to insulin; good preliminary evidence shows that these measures can also lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. A strong case can therefore be made for the use of physiologic intervention in the treatment of essential hypertension.\r"

A slow-release oral formulation containing 2 mg of ketotifen or placebo was administered daily for a duration of 12 weeks. Over a period of four weeks before the study, 94 percent of the patients had asthmatic attacks. 78 percent had cough, and 62 percent had nasal symptoms. In the group treated with slow-release oral ketotifen, there were 3.9 asthmatic attacks (range, 0 to 20) per week, and in the placebo group, there were 2.9 (range, 0 to 12) (mean values during four weeks prior to start of treatment). At the end of treatment, asthmatic attacks were significantly reduced in the group treated with slow-release oral ketotifen compared with placebo. Significant reduction was also evident for cough and sputum production, as well as nasal discharge and obstruction; however, slow-release oral ketotifen did not significantly improve pulmonary function indices when compared to placebo. The use of concomitant medication (beta-sympathomimetic drugs) was also significantly reduced in the group receiving slow-release oral ketotifen. The overall efficacy assessed by the investigators was \"very good\" and \"good\" in 76 percent of the group receiving slow-release oral ketotifen and 30 percent in the group receiving placebo (p less than 0.001). Tolerability rated by the investigators was \"very good\" and \"good\" in 90 percent of the group with slow-release oral ketotifen and in 96 percent of the group with placebo (p less than 0.10). The most frequent side effects were \"mild\" and \"moderate\" sedation, sleepiness and drowsiness reported in 44 percent of the patients receiving slow-release oral ketotifen and in 26 percent of the patients receiving placebo.

On four different experiment days, the following combinations of methacholine and histamine inhalation challenges were performed in 15 subjects (nine normal and six asthmatic) in a random fashion: methacholine-histamine, histamine-methacholine; methacholine-methacholine and histamine-histamine. Cumulative provocative dose of each agonist which caused a 50 percent decrease in SGaw was estimated (PD50). The second challenge was performed approximately 1 hour after the first challenge, when SGaw had returned to baseline. In normal subjects, prior muscarinic stimulation with methacholine suppressed the subsequent bronchoconstrictor response to histamine (mean +/- SE PD50 histamine increased from 13.7 +/- 3.1 to 28.4 +/- 7.2 breath units), without modifying the bronchoconstrictor response to methacholine. In asthmatic subjects, prior methacholine exposure failed to modify the bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine and methacholine. In contrast, prior challenge with histamine did not modify the subsequent bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine and methacholine in both normal and asthmatic subjects. Pretreatment with ipratropium bromide attenuated the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, suggesting that airway effects of histamine, in part, are vagally mediated. These data suggest that prior muscarinic stimulation has a protective effect on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in normal subjects and the absence of this inhibitory effect in asthmatic patients may represent loss of a protective muscarinic receptor mechanism.\r"

The findings suggested that neither baseline nonspecific airway reactivity nor specific markers of immediate sensitivity to tea predict airway responses to tea extracts. Further evaluation of immunologic markers may help to explain the onset and progression of airway disease in workers.\r"

We evaluated the time course of the recovery of alertness following CPAP therapy in OSAS patients. Thirty-nine patients with OSAS were treated with CPAP and evaluated after one, 14, or 42 nights of treatment, 13 patients being randomly assigned to each group. All received a diagnostic polysomnogram and MSLT before treatment. The three groups had similar baseline values for nocturnal respiratory disturbance, oxygenation during sleep, fragmentation of sleep, and level of EDS. CPAP treatment was associated with a significant improvement in sleep-related respiration, oxygenation, and sleep fragmentation. The EDS showed significant improvement after one night, and further significant improvement after 14 nights, but no further significant improvement after 42 nights. The differential rate of improvement in nocturnal parameters compared with that of primary complaint of EDS suggests that OSAS patients experience a chronic functional sleep loss. As with sleep deprivation, recovery of alertness in OSAS requires several nights of normal sleep.\r"

There are important problems to address in order to continue steady progress in understanding pulmonary defenses, including some of those mentioned in this brief review. There should be an increased use of infectious models that more closely mimic naturally occurring infections, and comparisons should be made between results obtained with parenteral versus intrapulmonary routes of infection.\r"

Combinations of frequency and tidal volume that maintained normocapnia were employed in random order before and after reduction of static compliance of the respiratory system by lung lavage. Heart rate was comparable during both modes of high-frequency ventilation. During both HFOV and HFJV, the cardiac output decreased and PVR increased in normal and surfactant-deficient cats as Paw was elevated (all p less than 0.01, ANOVA). For both HFOV and HFJV linear regression of Paw and cardiac output yielded comparable slopes and y-intercepts. Lung lavage reduced the effect of Paw but did not eliminate it. Changes in ventilatory frequency did not affect cardiac output or PVR. We conclude that the interaction between high-frequency ventilation and cardiovascular function is largely determined by Paw and compliance and is independent of ventilator frequency and the type of ventilator used.\r"

In the studies reported here we tested the hypothesis that endotoxin increases plasma ACTH levels by releasing interleukin-1 (Il-1). Two experimental tools reported to interfere with the biological activity of IL-1 were used: antibodies directed against IL-1 receptors and alpha MSH. In a first series of experiments, adult male mice were injected with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 25 micrograms), antibodies against IL-1 receptor, alpha MSH (1-30 micrograms), or LPS and either IL-1 antibodies or alpha MSH. All treatments were administered ip. The endotoxin LPS caused a marked increase in plasma ACTH levels, measured 6 h later. Both alpha MSH and the Il-1 receptor antibodies, while having no effect by themselves, significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) blocked LPS-induced ACTH release. In a second series of experiments, mice were injected ip with 500 ng recombinant human (rh) Il-1 alpha or 100 ng rhIl-1 beta in the presence or absence of alpha MSH (1-30 micrograms, ip). While not altering ACTH secretion induced by rhIl-1 alpha, 10-30 micrograms alpha MSH significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) interfered with the effect of rhIl-1 beta. These results suggest 1) that endotoxin activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through a mechanism involving the activation of interleukin-1 receptors; and 2) that the effect of rhIl-1 beta, but not -alpha, on ACTH secretion by the mouse can be partially blocked by alpha MSH.\r"

Many, but not all, of these neurons project to the external zone of the median eminence (ME), where the peptides are released from the nerve terminals into hypophysial portal vessels. In the present study, we identified these neurons by in vivo injection of a retrograde tracer, the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), into the external zone of the ME. Subsequently, colchicine was given into the lateral ventricle 10-24 h after the WGA injection. The animals were killed 24-48 h after the WGA injection. Vibratome sections of the brains were stained for both WGA and LHRH or SRIF with a dual immunocytochemical technique. Approximately 70% of the LHRH neurons in the septum and the anterior hypothalamus and about 70% of the SRIF neurons in the medial preoptic area, the anterior periventricular area, and the paraventricular nucleus were double labeled, indicating that they projected to the ME. None of the SRIF neurons in the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei were labeled with WGA. Double labeled LHRH cells were either smooth and fusiform or spiny. WGA-accumulating LHRH or SRIF perikarya were intermixed with single labeled LHRH or SRIF cells, which apparently did not project to the ME. The results indicate that there are at least two populations of LHRH neurons in the preoptic-septal region and two populations of SRIF neurons in the medial preoptic and anterior periventricular areas and the paraventricular nucleus of the rat brain: one with access to the portal capillaries of the ME and, therefore, functionally related to the regulation of the pituitary, and another without access to portal capillaries, perhaps functionally related to intracerebral neurotransmission or modulation. Moreover, some hypophysiotropic LHRH and SRIF neurons may have axon collaterals reaching multiple targets within the central nervous system.\r"

The HRE-H9 cell line was isolated by transforming primary rabbit endometrial cell cultures, derived from hCG-treated pseudopregnant rabbits, with a temperature-sensitive A209 mutant (tsA209) simian virus 40 at a permissive temperature (33 C). The resulting cells exhibited temperature sensitivity in growth and synthesis of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (ir-beta END). The ir-beta-END present in the cell extracts and culture media was assayed by a specific beta END RIA. Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography of the transformed cell extracts showed three peaks of beta END immunoreactivity. The first peak eluted at the void volume, the second peak coeluted with the beta-lipotropin standard, and the third peak coincided with the porcine beta END standard, ir-beta-END was also detectable in endometrial culture media, suggesting that the transformed endometrial cells secreted POMC-derived peptides. Our data indicate that the tsA209 mutant virus-transformed endometrial cell line provides a suitable model for study of the synthesis and regulation of POMC-derived peptides in extrapituitary tissues.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we present physiological evidence for rate-sensitive, fast feedback inhibition of secretion of ACTH and beta-endorphin (beta END)-related peptides. We used a 2 min restraint stress to physiologically increase plasma corticosterone, then examined the plasma responses of immunoreactive ACTH and beta END plus beta-lipotropin (beta END/beta LPH) to a subsequent restraint stress. After onset of this stress, plasma corticosterone increased from 2.5-10 min at a rate of 120 nM min-1, then remained at a peak from 10-15 min. A single 2 min restraint stress produced peak plasma levels of ACTH and beta END/beta LPH 2.5 min after onset of the stress, and these plasma concentrations declined after this initial stress at rates of 2.7 and 7.4 pM min-1, respectively. Application of a second restraint stress at the time of the peak corticosterone response produced plasma ACTH and beta END/beta LPH responses similar to those after the first stress. Application of a second stress during the period of significant rate-rise of corticosterone in plasma did not result in decreased incremental responses of plasma ACTH or beta END/beta LPH. However, the rates of decline of plasma ACTH and beta END/beta LPH of 7.6 and 32 pM min-1, respectively, from peak levels, were significantly greater after this second stress applied during the period of significant increase in plasma corticosterone concentration than the corresponding rates of decline observed after the initial stress or after a subsequent stress applied at the peak of plasma corticosterone. These differences in rates of decline of plasma ACTH or beta END/beta LPH appear to reflect differences in secretion rate rather than clearance, since disappearance of [125I]ACTH1-24 was not different after an initial vs. subsequent stress. In contrast to these data from intact rats, initial and subsequent stresses did not show different rates of decline of plasma ACTH or beta END/beta LPH in adrenalectomized rats. In conclusion, the stress-induced rate rise of glucocorticoid provides a negative feedback signal which serves to terminate and limit the duration, but not the peak, of the responses of POMC-derived peptides to subsequent stress.\r"

To determine whether alpha 2M is associated with remodeling phenomena in the rat ovary, the expression of alpha 2M mRNA and protein has been analyzed in specific ovarian cell types during ovulation, luteinization, and luteolysis. Before ovulation, alpha 2M mRNA is not detectable in granulosa cells. Twelve hours after injection of an ovulatory dose of hCG a 5.2-kilobase alpha 2M mRNA is detectable in luteinizing follicles, which is increased further by 48 h and maintained in corpora lutea (CL) for up to 96 h. Administration of PRL from 24-96 h results in both inhibition of luteolysis and marked increases in alpha 2M mRNA in CL, but not in residual tissues, of these same ovaries, isolated 48, 72, and 96 h after an ovulatory dose of hCG, alpha 2M mRNA is also induced by PRL in cultures of luteinized granulosa cells. These changes in alpha 2M mRNA in follicles or developing CL do not appear to reflect the amount of alpha 2M protein present: alpha 2M protein (188K monomer) is present (immunoblot and immunofluorescence data) in small antral and preovulatory follicles even though mRNA is not detectable; after an ovulatory dose of hCG the protein level transiently increases by 12 h (approximately 5-fold) and declines thereafter through 96 h; the decrease in alpha 2M protein observed at 48-96 h is delayed but not abolished by treatment with PRL, even though the mRNA levels continue to rise during this same time period. In contrast, changes in alpha 2M mRNA and protein are regulated coordinately in CL of pregnant rats. alpha 2M mRNA is present, but in low concentration, from days 4-11 of gestation, increases markedly between days 11-21, and decreases at parturition, when functional luteolysis occurs. Hysterectomy of day 10 pregnant rats combined with hormone replacement determined that alpha 2M mRNA levels are regulated primarily by PRL through day 12 and by placental lactogens during midgestation (days 12-15). The increase in alpha 2M mRNA during pregnancy precedes the 40-fold increase (peak) in a alpha 2M protein observed on day 15, which remains elevated through day 21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Insulin action on adipocytes induces two major metabolic effects: stimulation of glucose transport and inhibition of lipolysis. Previously, we have shown that incubated isolated adipocytes from starved (S), and streptozotocin-treated diabetic (D) rats show insulin resistance on glucose transport. It is not known whether insulin resistance is also present on antilipolysis. In this study the antilipolytic action of insulin was investigated. Since basal lipolysis was low, lipolysis was first stimulated by isoproterenol (ISO). This showed that differences existed in sensitivity for ISO among control (C), S, and D adipocytes. We investigated whether changes in adenosine accumulation could attribute to the differences in ISO action and thereby influence insulin action. When endogenous accumulating adenosine was removed by adenosine deaminase and replaced by a fixed concentration (200 nM) of the nonhydrolyzable adenosine analog phenylisopropyladenosine, the differences in ISO action disappeared. This indicates that the sensitivity of C, S, and D adipocytes for ISO is strongly influenced by endogenous adenosine release. The dose-response relationship between insulin and inhibition of ISO-stimulated lipolysis showed that insulin sensitivity was increased and responsiveness unaltered in S and D compared to C adipocytes for incubations with both uncontrolled and controlled adenosine concentrations. This indicates that during S and D states, endogenous adenosine release has no major effect on insulin action. The increased sensitivity for insulin of S and D adipocytes was paralleled by an increased binding of [125I]iodoinsulin. The unaltered responsiveness for insulin indicates that there is no insulin resistance at the postbinding level for antilipolysis, i.e. intracellular processes for antilipolysis are intact. This is in contrast to glucose transport, where insulin resistance exists at the postbinding level during S and D. Thus, insulin resistance is no general phenomenon, but is confined to specific effector systems.\r"

  ".W": "The binding characteristics of CRF receptors in rat frontal cerebral cortex membranes solubilized in 1% digitonin were determined. The binding of [125I]Tyro-ovine CRF ([125I]oCRF) to solubilized membrane proteins was dependent on incubation time, temperature, and protein concentration, was saturable and of high affinity, and was absent in boiled tissue. The solubilized receptors retained their high affinity for [125I] oCRF in the solubilized state, exhibiting a dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 200 pM, as determined by direct binding saturation isotherms. Solubilized CRF receptors maintained the rank order of potencies for various related and unrelated CRF peptides characteristic of the membrane CRF receptor: rat/human CRF congruent to ovine CRF congruent to Nle21,38-rat CRF greater than alpha-helical oCRF-(9-41) greater than oCRF-(7-41) much greater than vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, or the substance-P antagonist. Furthermore, the absolute potencies (Ki values) for the various CRF-related peptides in solubilized receptors were almost identical to those observed in the membrane preparations, indicating that the CRF receptor retained its high affinity binding capacity in the digitonin-solubilized state. Chemical affinity cross-linking of digitonin-solubilized rat cortical membrane proteins revealed a specifically labeled protein with an apparent mol wt of 58,000 which was similar to the labeled protein in native membrane homogenates. Although solubilized CRF receptors retained their high affinity for agonists, their sensitivity for guanine nucleotide was lost. Size exclusion chromatography substantiated these results, demonstrating that in the presence or absence of guanine nucleotides, [125I]oCRF labeled the same size receptor complex. These data suggest that either the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ns) is tightly associated with the CRF receptor after solubilization and is insensitive to guanine nucleotides, or that high affinity binding for soluble CRF receptors is not dependent on the coupling of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The solubilization of CRF receptors from membranes in digitonin should allow for the more complete molecular and functional characterization of CRF-mediated events and purification of the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Truncated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) possesses a potent stimulatory activity for insulin secretion and a slight inhibiting activity for glucagon secretion. The aim of this paper is to examine the activities of N- and C-terminal fragments of GLP-1 using a rat pancreas perfusion system. Concerning the N-terminal portion, GLP-1(7-37) amide elicited a clear insulinotropic activity at 0.1 or 1 nM with the perfusate containing 5.5 mM glucose and 5 mM arginine, while 10 nM GLP-1-(1-37) amide, -(6-37) amide, and -(8-37) amide did not. Concerning the C-terminal portion, GLP-1-(7-37) amide, -(7-37), and -(7-36) amide had a similar potency of insulinotropic activity, and GLP-1-(7-35) was less potent; 0.1 nM GLP-1-(7-35) did not stimulate insulin release, nor did 10 nM GLP-1-(7-20). Glucagon release was significantly suppressed by 1 and 10 nM GLP-1-(7-37) amide, 10 nM GLP-1-(7-37), and 1 nM GLP-1-(7-36) amide. Other fragment peptides of GLP-1, including GLP-1-(7-35), had no effect. From these results it is concluded that histidine at position 7 of GLP-1 as a free N-terminal amino acid is very important in GLP-1's insulinotropic activity and probably in glucagon-inhibiting activity, and that C-terminal amidation and three C-terminal amino acids are less important for these activities.\r"

  ".W": "A universal finding in hyperglycemic patients with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is that all share a common defect in glucose recognition resulting in abnormal insulin secretion by pancreatic islet beta-cells. This defect is 1) specific for glucose signals rather than global, 2) related to chronic hyperglycemia, and 3) partially reversible after brief treatment with insulin to induce normoglycemia and through use of other pharmacological agents without normalizing glucose levels. My perspective is that an essential component of this defect is secondary and may represent a state of homologous desensitization of the beta-cell secretory apparatus to glucose. Elucidation of the biochemical mechanism(s) of defective recognition of glucose signals by beta-cells--or glucose \"non-sense\"--in these patients will provide key insights into the pathogenesis of type II diabetes mellitus.\r"

The insulin proreceptor cDNA has been cloned and its complete amino acid sequence deduced. The availability of cDNA permitted an analysis of both the role of protein tyrosine kinase activity in insulin action and the autophosphorylation sites that regulate kinase activity. The human cDNA probe has also been used to identify a putative Drosophila insulin receptor.

  ".W": "Glucose tolerance depends on a complex interaction among insulin secretion from the beta-cells, clearance of the hormone, and the actions of insulin to accelerate glucose disappearance and inhibit endogenous glucose production. An additional factor, less well recognized, is the ability of glucose per se, independent of changes in insulin, to increase glucose uptake and suppress endogenous output (glucose effectiveness). These factors can be measured in the intact organism with physiologically based minimal models of glucose utilization and insulin kinetics. With the glucose minimal model, insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) are measured by computer analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The test involves intravenous injection of glucose followed by tolbutamide or insulin and frequent blood sampling. SI varied from a high of 7.6 x 10(-4) min-1.microU-1.ml-1 in young Whites to 2.3 x 10(-4) min-1.microU-1.ml-1 in obese nondiabetic subjects; in all of the nondiabetic subjects, SG was normal. In subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), not only was SI reduced 90% below normal (0.61 +/- 0.16 x 10(-4) min-1.microU-1.ml-1), but in this group alone, SG was reduced (from 0.026 +/- 0.008 to 0.014 +/- 0.002 min-1); thus, defects in SI and SG are synergistic in causing glucose intolerance in NIDDM. One assumption of the minimal model is that the time delay in insulin action on glucose utilization in vivo is due to sluggish insulin transport across the capillary endothelium. This was tested by comparing insulin concentrations in plasma with those in lymph (representing interstitial fluid) during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps. Lymph insulin was lower than plasma insulin at basal (12 vs. 18 microU/ml) and at steady state, indicating significant loss of insulin from the interstitial space, presumably due to cellular uptake of the insulin-receptor complex. Additionally, during clamps, lymph insulin changed more slowly than plasma insulin, but the rate of glucose utilization followed a time course identical with that of lymph (r = .96) rather than plasma (r = .71). Thus, lymph insulin, which may be reflective of interstitial fluid, is the signal to which insulin-sensitive tissues are responding. These studies support the concept that, at physiological insulin levels, the time for insulin to cross the capillary endothelium is the process that determines the rate of insulin action in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels rose moderately in both psyllium- and placebo-fed animals during the study, whereas triglyceride levels remained unchanged in both groups. Psyllium's effect on glycemic, lipid, and hormone parameters was not explained by weight loss or reduced food intake; these were similar in psyllium- and placebo-fed animals during the study.

To characterize its action on islet cells, the release of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin by rat pancreatic islet monolayer cultures at varying concentrations of GLP-I-(7-36) was measured. The interaction of GLP-I-(7-36) with nutrient substrates was assessed by adding amino acids and differing glucose concentrations to the cultures.

To determine if retinol acts at the beta-cell level, we assayed beta-cells of the rat insulinoma (RINm5F) line for cytosolic retinol- and retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRBP and CRABP) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and [3H]retinol and [3H]retinoic acid binding to cytosol extracts. Furthermore, we tested whether insulin release from cells was affected by addition of retinol or retinoic acid to culture medium. RINm5F cells were grown to near confluence before assay of CRBP and CRABP. Scatchard analysis showed the Kd for retinol to be approximately 6 nM at a level of 4.5 pmol/mg protein or 300,000 sites/cell. Sucrose density-gradient assay showed single discrete peaks migrating at 2S for both retinol and retinoic acid. RIA of whole-cell extracts showed CRBP and CRABP levels of 5.27 +/- 0.41 and 2.95 +/- 0.75 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Retinol (1.75 microM) and retinoic acid (0.175 and 1.75 microM) increased KCl-induced insulin release. Considered together, the presence of CRBP and CRABP in a beta-cell line and the increase in KCl-induced insulin release by retinol and retinoic acid are consistent with the idea that retinol has a functional role in insulin secretion and suggest a potential mechanism of action at the beta-cell level similar to that observed in other retinoid-responsive cells.\r"

To elucidate the role of insulin secretion in the hyperinsulinemia of aging, 10 elderly (age 66 +/- 4 yr, body mass index 25 +/- kg/m2) and 8 young (age 30 +/- 5 yr, body mass index 24 +/- 3 kg/m2) subjects were studied to determine rates of insulin secretion in response to fasting, mixed meals, and intravenous glucose administration. Insulin secretion was determined with a two-compartment model based on individual C-peptide kinetic parameters derived after bolus injection of biosynthetic human C-peptide. Basal insulin secretion rates were increased in elderly subjects (82.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 62.8 +/- 6.1 pmol.min-1.m-2; P less than .05). This was reflected in elevated serum insulin levels in elderly subjects (62.8 +/- 10.1 vs. 41.1 +/- 5.0 pM, P less than .05). During a 24-h mixed-meal profile, elderly subjects had an increase in their glucose response (P less than .01 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]) and total insulin secretion (261 +/- 28 vs. 195 +/- 22 nmol.24 h-1.m-2; P less than .05) compared with young subjects. However, the relative total increases in both glycemia and insulin secretion, calculated as a function of basal levels, were similar between the groups (both NS). To experimentally control for differences in glycemia, both groups underwent a 16.8-mM hyperglycemic clamp and a stepped intravenous glucose infusion to match glycemia. Under these steady-state and dynamic conditions, insulin secretion profiles were nearly identical (NS by ANOVA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

GH-provocative tests with intravenous infusion of arginine revealed that urinary GH levels are closely correlated with the integrated concentrations of serum GH (r = .931, n = 14, P less than .001). Furthermore, 24-h urinary GH in control and diabetic subjects was inversely related to body mass index (r = .359, n = 80, P less than .001). The mean 24-h urinary GH in NIDDM subjects was 11.1 +/- 1.9 ng/g creatinine (Cr), which was not significantly different from that in nondiabetic control subjects (9.2 +/- 2.7 ng/g Cr). By contrast, the individual values for IDDM subjects varied widely, and their mean values (42.5 +/- 20.8 ng/g Cr) were much greater than those in the control and NIDDM subjects (P less than .01). The degree of glycemic control does not seem to affect 24-h urinary GH in NIDDM. The mean 24-h urinary GH in 7 subjects with proliferative diabetic retinopathy was comparable to that in subjects without retinopathy or with background retinopathy. Thus, the measurement of 24-h urinary GH appears to provide reliable assessments of endogenous GH secretion under physiological conditions and will be a useful tool for obtaining further insight into the role of GH in diabetes.\r"

Rat embryos in the early head-fold stage (9.5 days gestation) were grown in vitro for 48 h until neural tube closure occurred; dysmorphogenic lesions were not elicited in either the basal culture medium containing 6.6 mM glucose (control medium) or the hyperglycemic medium supplemented with glucose at a concentration of 33.3 mM.

Postimplantation embryos (in early neural tube formation) were briefly exposed (1 h) to hypoglycemic medium on day 10.3 of gestation during the basal culture. After exposure to the hypoglycemic medium for 1 h during culture in the control medium, embryos showed minor growth retardation and dysmorphogenic lesions (7.1% open neural pores).

When monocytes from the three groups of subjects were exposed to 100 nM unlabeled insulin for 30 min at 37 degrees C, the subsequent cell-surface 125I-labeled insulin binding was reduced, but the total number of insulin receptors, measured by radioimmunoassay, was not changed.

Seven nondiabetic and seven IDDM subjects were studied with the pancreatic clamp technique to control plasma insulin, growth hormone, and glucagon concentrations at the desired levels. Preliminary studies were performed to validate the experimental design. The palmitate flux response to insulin withdrawal (2.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and maximally antilipolytic insulin concentrations (0.17 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.03 mumol.kg-1.min-1) were not different in nondiabetic and IDDM subjects, respectively. In contrast, IDDM subjects required significantly greater plasma free-insulin concentrations to result in equivalent suppression of palmitate flux compared with nondiabetic subjects. Lipolysis was found to be very sensitive to insulin in nondiabetic humans, with half-maximal suppression occurring at plasma free-insulin concentrations of approximately 12 pM (less than 2 microU/ml). We conclude that adipose tissue lipolysis is normally exquisitely sensitive to insulin and that sensitivity, but not responsiveness to insulin, is impaired in poorly controlled IDDM.\r"

The physiological function of pericytes is not yet clearly identified, although it probably has contractile properties. We determined the specific binding of endothelin 1, a 21-amino acid peptide with potent vasoconstrictive action, and the stimulation of diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (DAG/PKC) pathway in cultured retinal capillary pericytes by endothelin. A single specific binding site for 125I-labeled endothelin was identified, with an apparent Kd of 1.3 nM and a maximal binding capacity of approximately 1-2 x 10(5) sites/cell. Endothelin (100 nM) increased total cellular DAG content by 15% at 5 min and 24% at 10 min. When pericytes were labeled isotopically with [3H]glycerol, endothelin stimulated [3H]DAG formation by 100% at 10 min and 88% at 30 min. After 10 min of endothelin treatment, PKC activities were increased by 60 and 100% in the membranous and cytosolic pools, respectively. We conclude that bovine retinal capillary pericytes possess numerous high-affinity specific binding sites for endothelin that mediate the action of endothelin by the stimulation of the DAG/PKC pathway in pericytes. These findings suggest that endothelin is a regulator of the contractile properties of pericytes, which may be adversely affected in diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse develops a high incidence of autoimmune diabetes and is believed to be a good model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in humans. We isolated T-lymphocyte lines from islets of newly diabetic NOD mice, some of which are autoreactive to NOD spleen cells. Because autoreactive T-lymphocytes have been implicated in immune suppression, we injected NOD mice with an autoreactive T-lymphocyte line. The injected mice had a marked decrease in incidence of IDDM compared with control mice. Moreover, their islets showed no insulitis at 1 yr of age. We conclude that autoreactive T-lymphocytes can prevent the development of IDDM in NOD mice. This result suggests that 1) islets contain both effector cells capable of damaging pancreatic beta-cells and cells able to regulate this autoimmune response, and 2) development of IDDM depends on the balance between these opposing forces.\r"

  ".W": "Human intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are CD8+ T cells located between intestinal epithelial cells, capable of only minimal proliferation to mitogens but brisk proliferation to mitogens combined with sheep red blood cells. This study examines this differential response of IEL. Both IEL and CD8+ T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood are predominantly CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, CD5+, CD8+, and express the alpha beta subunits of the T-cell receptor. Human IEL express the same densities of the CD2, CD3, and CD8 antigens but a lower density of the CD5 antigen than do peripheral blood CD8+ T cells. The proliferation of IEL is significantly less than that of peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes in response to phytohemagglutinin, to concanavalin A, or to anti-CD3 antibody bound to Sepharose (p less than 0.05). Supplementing IEL with interleukin-1, interleukin-2, or autologous peripheral blood macrophages does not completely reconstitute the proliferative response of IEL to these stimuli. Rather, the low proliferation of IEL to these stimuli is due to incomplete activation, as demonstrated by the low percentage of CD25 (Tac)+ lymphocytes with concanavalin A or the low density of the CD25 antigen with phytohemagglutinin. Both IEL and peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes proliferate minimally in response to alloantigens or to interleukin-2, but briskly in response to stimuli of the CD2 receptor such as the combination of anti-T11(2) and anti-T11(3) antibodies or mitogen and sheep red blood cells. The sheep red blood cells enhance the mitogen-induced response of IEL by augmenting events of activation, both interleukin-2 production and interleukin-2 receptor expression. Thus, IEL represent an unusual compartment of CD2+, CD3+ T lymphocytes that are activated more completely by stimuli of the CD2 receptor than by stimuli of the CD3 receptor or by T-cell mitogens.\r"

Preoperative measurements by ultrasound were compared with measurements taken directly from operative cholangiograms and excellent correlation was observed (r = 0.938). Studies were repeated 1 mo, 12 mo, and 5 yr after operation. Of 21 patients returning for study at 5 yr, there were 4 patients with 1-mm ducts before surgery who showed an increase in the size of the common hepatic duct but in none was the final measurement greater than 4 mm. Mean common hepatic duct diameter (n = 21) increased from 3.95 mm before to 4.48 mm 5 yr after surgery (p = 0.24, paired t-test). Common bile duct was more easily seen after cholecystectomy and of 13 ducts satisfactorily measured 1 and 5 yr after surgery, 7 showed an increase in size (mean common hepatic duct 1 yr = 4.77 mm, 5 yr = 5.92 mm, p = 0.059, paired t-test). Significant dilatation of the common hepatic duct was seen in only 2 of 21 patients, but a strong trend to minor dilatation was observed in the common bile duct after cholecystectomy.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred fifty-four liver lesions, including 63 hepatocellular carcinomas, were studied to determine the value of duplex ultrasound in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas. Arterial Doppler signals were obtained either within the body of the tumor, at its periphery, or in both locations, from 28 to 37 hepatocellular carcinomas less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter and from all 26 hepatocellular carcinomas with a diameter greater than 3 cm. Arterial Doppler signals were obtained at the periphery of 5 of 7 cholangiocarcinomas, 4 of 11 liver metastatic tumors, and 5 of 23 hemangiomas. No such signals were obtained from 29 regenerative nodules, 10 hepatic pseudotumors, and 11 liver cysts. The mean peak systolic frequency seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (1.2 kHz) was significantly greater than in cholangiocarcinoma (0.6 kHz), metastatic tumors (0.5 kHz), or hemangiomas (0.3 kHz). A peak systolic frequency of greater than 3 kHz was found in 6 of 8 hepatocellular carcinomas greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter with angiographically proven arterioportal shunting, whereas the value in other hepatocellular carcinomas or other hepatic focal lesions was less than 2.6 kHz. This study showed that the peak systolic shift was related to the degree of arterioportal shunting. Because shunting is either minor or nonexistent in small hepatocellular carcinomas, the value of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis of these lesions appears to be limited.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective clinical trial, 85 patients with acute pancreatitis, including 50 with acute interstitial-edematous pancreatitis and 35 with necrotizing pancreatitis, were recruited. Serum pancreatic immunoreactive phospholipase A2 (IR-PLA2), serum phospholipase A catalytic activity (CA-PLA), and serum phospholipase A2 catalytic activity (CA-PLA2) were determined daily between day 1 and day 10 after the onset of the disease. The serum course of IR-PLA2 values for patients with acute interstitial-edematous pancreatitis was comparable to that for patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. In contrast, the determination of CA-PLA and of CA-PLA2 specific activity in the serum revealed a high differentiation between patients with interstitial edematous and those with necrotizing pancreatitis. The overall accuracy for differentiating patients with necrotizing pancreatitis from those with the interstitial-edematous type was 79% for CA-PLA and 77% for CA-PLA2 (cut-off level: CA-PLA, 15 U/L, day 1-5; CA-PLA2, 3.5 U/L, day 1-5). Patients with pancreatitis-associated pulmonary complications showed significantly higher CA-PLA and CA-PLA2 values in the serum. This study demonstrates the role of serum catalytic phospholipase A2 in human acute pancreatitis where the development of pancreatic necrosis and pulmonary failure is concerned.\r"

Excitatory pancreatic flow responses with frequently increased antral contractility and small changes in blood pressure were induced by stimulation of the ventral and dorsal portions of the anterior hypothalamic area, the lateral part of the middle hypothalamus, and the mamillary body. The inhibitory pancreatic responses with reduced antral and corpus contractility and elevated blood pressure were elicited by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic area, the middle portion of the anterior hypothalamus and the most dorsal area of the hypothalamus. Both excitatory and inhibitory responses were obtained even in dogs with cervical cord transection. The excitatory responses and some of the inhibitory ones were abolished by vagotomy or atropine, but some inhibitory responses remained even after vagotomy. These results indicate that hypothalamic stimulation induced both excitatory and inhibitory responses in pancreatic exocrine secretion via the vagus and other routes.\r"

The difference between omeprazole and cimetidine was not appreciably affected by age, smoking, size of the ulcer and trial centre. Tolerability was similar in the two treatment groups. In the treatment of symptomatic gastric ulcer, omeprazole relieves the symptoms more quickly than cimetidine and heals a greater proportion of ulcers within four weeks.\r"

In a randomised double blind trial we compared 2 g olsalazine with placebo for four weeks. Of the 105 patients, with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, entered in the trial 52 received olsalazine, and 53 placebo. Treatment had to be terminated prematurely because of untoward effects of olsalazine (mainly diarrhoea) in three patients and treatment failure--that is, increased rectal bleeding in four patients (olsalazine group: one placebo group: three). After four weeks' treatment, a statistically significant improvement in the endoscopic findings in rectum and a positive trend in the reduction of rectal mucus and blood discharge was observed in the patients treated with olsalazine. No statistically significant difference was found for other factors, including stool frequency, consistency, urge to defecate, abdominal pain, and biopsy findings. A comparison between these clinical and endoscopic parameters at study entry and those at study completion (within drug evaluation) showed significant improvement in six of 10 parameters during treatment with olsalazine and in two of 10 during placebo treatment. This difference suggests the significant effect of olsalazine. We conclude that 2 g olsalazine was tolerated as well as placebo, apart from causing diarrhoea in some patients and was slightly superior to placebo during four weeks' treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. A study with 3 or 4 g olsalazine per day may show a more definite effect.\r"

The area of infiltration was significantly greater for a given inoculum in the large bowel. Acid fast bacilli were present on Ziehl Neelson stained sections of the large bowel infiltrate, but only rarely in sections from the small bowel lesions. The response to skin testing with a standardised amount of purified protein derivative was less in animals inoculated in the small bowel. Inoculation with 2 x 10(9) cobalt irradiated BCG gave rise, at five weeks, to granulomas containing lesser numbers of epithelioid cells and caseation was sometimes evident. There was a similar but smaller difference in the degree of infiltration at the two inoculation sites. Ziehl Neelson staining failed to reveal the presence of acid fast bacilli in any sections of the bowel infiltrates. Skin testing with purified protein derivative gave a response which was greater in animals inoculated in the small bowel. An identical dose of Cobalt irradiated M leprae induced at five weeks a predominantly macrophage granuloma in both the large and small bowel, with no significant difference in the degree of infiltration at the two sites. No acid fast bacilli were seen in Ziehl Neelson stained sections of the bowel and skin testing with purified protein derivative was reduced. These findings and their relevance to studies of the aetiology of Crohn's disease are discussed.\r"

The remaining seven (18.4%) were not evident angiographically but were detected using ultrasonography and/or computed tomography, prior to angiography. An elevated level of serum alpha-fetoprotein also suggested a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. When comparisons were made between angiographically detected and undetected nodules, there was no statistically significant difference in parameters, including sex of the patient, tumor size, location of the tumor, positive rate for hepatitis B surface antigen, history of liver disease and values of alpha-fetoprotein. The small hepatocellular carcinomas not detected angiographically and evidenced only histologically had the following characteristics: (i) no fibrous capsule surrounding the nodules; (ii) well-differentiated tumors; (iii) replacing growth pattern of cancer cells, and (iv) remains of portal tracts within the tumor. The replacing growth pattern and the presence of portal tracts may correlate with the low detectability in angiography. When a definite diagnosis of angiographically undetectable tumors cannot be made using close surveillance with ultrasonography or alpha-fetoprotein and/or needle biopsy under ultrasonic guide, surgical intervention should be considered, particularly for patients at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the immune process involved in the pathogenesis of liver cell damage in chronic hepatitis delta virus infection, a panel of monoclonal antibodies against pan T cells (Leu 4), inducer/helper T cells (Leu 3a+3b), suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (Leu 2a), B cells (Leu 12), monocytes/macrophages (Leu M3) and NK/K cells Leu 7) was used to characterize the subsets of the mononuclear cell infiltrates in livers from 12 patients with chronic type D hepatitis, with special emphasis on the areas of periportal piecemeal necrosis and intralobular necrosis. A control group of 12 patients with chronic type B hepatitis was also studied for comparison. The results revealed that the livers from patients with chronic type D hepatitis showed a prominent mononuclear cell infiltration in portal/periportal and intralobular areas. Furthermore, the vast majority of the mononuclear cell infiltrates in liver were T cells, which constituted more than 80% of the cells in the areas of periportal piecemeal necrosis and intralobular necrosis and about 60% of the cells in the portal tract, whereas B cells, monocytes/macrophages and NK/K cells were relatively uncommon. Among T cell populations, the inducer/helper T cells were predominant in the portal were predominant in the areas of piecemeal necrosis and intralobular necrosis. The distribution of the mononuclear cell subsets in relation to the different topographical areas of the liver in patients with chronic type B hepatitis was essentially the same as that observed in chronic type D hepatitis. Our findings therefore suggest that T cell-mediated immunity might play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic type D hepatitis, similar to that suggested for chronic type B hepatitis.\r"

The findings were correlated with the expression of the hepatitis delta antigen, the duration of the hepatitis delta virus infection and the eosinophilic degeneration of the hepatocytes. Intranuclear hepatitis delta virus RNA and antigen were found in 28 specimens, whereas the remaining five were negative for both markers. Hepatitis delta virus RNA and antigen were mostly found within the same cell. In 20 specimens, however, a variable number of hepatocytes showed the presence of hepatitis delta virus RNA alone. The percentage of these over the total number of infected cells was higher in the specimens taken within 1 year from the acute delta hepatitis, whereas their absence was invariably associated with a long-established hepatitis delta virus infection. Interestingly, the vast majority of hepatocytes undergoing eosinophilic degeneration, a change significantly associated with hepatitis delta virus infection, did not show the presence of either hepatitis delta virus RNA or the viral antigen, suggesting a lack of association, at the cellular level, between viral replication and cytopathological change. The specificity of the detection of hepatitis delta virus RNA was confirmed by negative findings in nine specimens from seven chronic hepatitis B virus carriers without evidence of past or current hepatitis delta virus infection. The loss in sensitivity due to the formalin fixation was estimated to be 50% of that obtained in frozen biopsies, as determined by counting autoradiographic grains over infected cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial of intravenous somatostatin (Stilamin; Serono Laboratories, Inc., Randolph, MA) was performed in 102 patients with actively bleeding esophageal varices from August, 1985, to November, 1986. Patients had major hemorrhage indicated by hematemesis or melena and evidence of significant blood loss. For entry, patients had to have endoscopic demonstration of active bleeding from esophageal varices or stigmata of recent hemorrhage and bright red blood in the gastric aspirate with no other source of bleeding found. Randomized patients received identical-appearing somatostatin or placebo for a 30-hr study period. Those given somatostatin received a 250-micrograms bolus and a 250-micrograms per hr infusion with repeat bolus and doubling of the infusion if the bleeding was not controlled. In retrospect, 18 patients could not be evaluated. Of the 84 evaluable patients, 48 received somatostatin and 36 placebo. They were comparable in age, gender, severity of liver disease and history of variceal bleeding. Transfusion requirements were similar in both groups. Bleeding stopped for 12 consecutive hr during 30 hr of the study period in 31 (65%) of the somatostatin group vs. 30 (83%) of the placebo group (p = 0.06). The median time to cessation of bleeding was 2 hr in the placebo group and 3 hr in the somatostatin group. Deaths following the study period were nine (25%) in the placebo group and 15 (31%) in the somatostatin group. Within the limitations of the present study, we conclude that somatostatin was ineffective in the management of active bleeding of esophageal varices.\r"

A careful dietary history showed no significant difference in caffeine consumption (mean +/- S.E.) among 46 cirrhotics (86 +/- 7 mg per day) vs. 34 control patients (91 +/- 8 mg per day). Fasting plasma caffeine concentrations, however, were significantly higher (7.68 +/- 1.42 micrograms per ml) in cirrhotics than in controls (1.01 +/- 0.20 micrograms per ml) (p less than 0.01). Fasting plasma caffeine concentrations in cirrhotics varied significantly with Child's criteria, namely Child's A patients (2.06 +/- 0.38 micrograms per ml); Child's B patients (6.92 +/- 1.86 micrograms per ml), and Child's C patients (17.70 +/- 3.65 micrograms per ml) (p less than 0.001). In 44 cirrhotics, fasting plasma caffeine concentrations were compared with plasma levels of catecholamines and plasma renin activity. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were normal; however, plasma norepinephrine concentrations were increased in six cirrhotics, and plasma renin activities were increased in 28 cirrhotics. After a 3-day caffeine abstinence, plasma caffeine concentration and renin activity were significantly decreased (p less than 0.01), and high plasma norepinephrine levels were also decreased in 12 cirrhotics. Plasma caffeine concentration, renin activity and norepinephrine level did not change in a control group of cirrhotics who continued to receive caffeine for 3 days (n = 6). After abstinence from caffeine, the decrease of fasting plasma caffeine concentration correlated well with the decrease of plasma renin activity (r = +0.746, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate volume-regulating processes in the hepatocyte, a rapid and precise method of measuring cell volume in isolated hepatocytes was devised which uses a Coulter Counter equipped with a Channelyzer. Isolated hepatocytes exhibit a volume-decreasing mechanism (potassium channel) which is triggered by cell volume increases as small as 10%. Cell volume increases in the hepatocyte may be mediated by activity of the Na:H exchanger. To examine Na:H exchange-mediated cell volume increases, without apparent interference by the volume-decreasing mechanism, acetate was substituted for chloride in the incubation medium. Hepatocytes placed in a medium containing sodium acetate at an acidic pH exhibit a continuous amiloride-sensitive swelling. A simple procedure was devised for estimating Na:H exchanger set-point by electronic cell sizing. In a sodium acetate medium, the internal pH equilibrates with the external pH. By placing cells in sodium acetate medium of various pH values and measuring the rate of amiloride-sensitive swelling, an estimate of Na:H exchanger set-point can be obtained. By this method, the exchanger was estimated to cease activity above an intracellular pH of 7.2. This method could be useful for identification of stimuli that might promote cell enlargement by raising the exchanger set-point. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate tetraacetic acid raises the set-point of the exchanger in the isolated hepatocytes, resulting in exchanger activity at normal cellular pH, and at the same time promotes hepatocyte swelling. Exchanger activation via a kinase C-mediated mechanism is one possible way that hepatocyte enlargement may occur.\r"

The purpose of this review is to describe studies of blood pressure responses in several experimental models of salt-sensitive hypertension and in hypertensive humans to selective dietary sodium loading (without chloride) and to selective dietary chloride loading (without sodium). The full expression of salt sensitivity depends on high dietary intakes of both sodium and chloride. This observation has implications for understanding mechanisms contributing to NaCl-induced hypertension in the susceptible host.\r"

Our aim in the present study was to further investigate this issue through the method of linkage analysis. Analysis of 96 hypertensive siblings distributed in 31 families indicated a significant distortion (p = 0.0009) of the normal segregation pattern of inheritance of HLA haplotypes. Thus, our data indicate that at least one of the genes responsible for genetic predisposition to essential hypertension is located very near or within the HLA complex.\r"

By using specific DNA probes, we have identified four polymorphisms in the human renin gene with the restriction enzymes Taq I, HindIII, Bgl I, and Bgl II. The gene location of all of these polymorphisms except for the Bgl II polymorphism has been determined, and their frequencies were initially estimated in a population of 50 random subjects. To test the clinical significance of these polymorphisms, we studied 68 persons from a large Utah pedigree with a high incidence of hypertension. Among nine relatives with hypertension, genetic linkage without recombination was ruled out by observing several obligate recombinants. We also found no significant association of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms with quantitative measurements of sitting or standing, systolic or diastolic blood pressures, or plasma renin activity in 59 untreated members of this pedigree. Although we found no genetic linkage in this set of study subjects, the characterization of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the renin gene may be useful in future studies of other selected pedigrees for the presence of one or more of these to be a genetic marker in hypertension.\r"

Hypervolemic hemodilution is a new therapy that is used in the patient with decreased CBF. The therapy is designed to decrease the hematocrit and the viscosity of blood, subsequently increasing CBF. The patient must have a documented SAH and have a baseline neurologic status compatible with aggressive intervention to qualify for the therapy. The infusion technique is begun with 5% albumin and continued for 3 to 7 days. The dosage is gradually tapered before discontinuation. Effectiveness of the therapy is measured through improvement in neurologic function and regional CBF measurements. The critical care nurse plays a vital role in administering and monitoring the therapy and in educating the family about the disease process and interventions.\r"

Stress was evaluated by apical heart rates, peripheral temperatures, cardiac complications, and qualitative patient evaluative data. Data analysis revealed that lowering apical heart rates and raising peripheral temperatures were more successful in the relaxation and music therapy groups than in the control group. The incidence of cardiac complications was found to be lower in the intervention groups, and most intervention subjects believed that such therapy was helpful.

  ".W": "The hips of 1000 newborn babies were examined clinically and by ultrasonography. The ultrasound assessment was based on measurements of the coverage of the femoral head by the bony acetabular roof, and this parameter was called the Bony Rim Percentage (BRP). The mean BRP was 55.3% in girls and 57.2% in boys, a significant difference. Clinical instability occurred in 0.7% of the newborn babies, and all of the unstable hips had a BRP below the lower limit of normal. All infants with normal clinical findings and suspected abnormal hips based on ultrasound were followed up; in all but two the hips became normal spontaneously. We conclude that ultrasonography, using the measurements of femoral head coverage, is appropriate for screening the newborn, is reliable in differentiating between a true and a false positive Ortolani sign, and that hip dysplasia which is not clinically demonstrable at birth can be detected by ultrasound. Ultrasound should replace radiography as the routine method of following up high-risk infants and those with suspicious signs.\r"

Of these 54 were followed for four years. Conservatively-treated patients regained movement significantly more quickly and fully, returned to work and sport earlier and had fewer unsatisfactory results than those having early operation. For severe dislocations, with acromioclavicular displacement of 2 cm or more, early surgery produced better results. Conservative management is best for most acute dislocations, but younger patients with severe displacement may benefit from early reduction and stabilisation.\r"

  ".W": "There are relatively few circumstances wherein the assay of TRAb, as TSAb or TBIAb, is merited in the routine clinical management of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. These include: 1. the prediction of neonatal hyperthyroidism; 2. the confirmation, by assay of maternal serum, and perhaps newborn blood, that neonatal hypothyroidism, identified on routine screening, may be transient and due to transplacental passage of TBIAb; 3. the prediction of relapse of hyperthyroidism at the end of a course of antithyroid drugs; this information should lead to more careful observation to identify relapse as early as possible; 4. the confirmation that adult agoitrous hypothyroidism reflects the effect of an antibody (TBIAb) blocking the action of TSH although, as discussed, there is little, if any, practical gain from this information. Additional applications of the routine use of TRAb assays will require the development of a procedure that combines the sensitivity, specificity, availability, and ease found variably in current TSAb and TBI procedures, and at much less cost than what is provided today.\r"

  ".U": "90062406\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of nafarelin (400 micrograms daily; 12 patients) and danazol (600 mg daily; 6 patients) on serum lipoproteins, high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions, and apoproteins-A-I and -A-II were studied. Lipoproteins were fractionated by sequential flotation from samples taken before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment as well as 3 months after cessation of medication. Serum concentrations of estradiol, total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and sex hormone-binding globulin were also determined. On nafarelin treatment, serum total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations increased slightly, but total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were unchanged. There was no effect on apoproteins-A-I and -A-II or on total and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride concentrations. During treatment with danazol, the serum levels of total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol showed profound decrease, as did all the components of HDL2, including apoprotein-A-I. Concomitantly, the total mass of LDL was increased by 25%, accounted for by parallel rises in all of the components of LDL. Total and VLDL triglyceride concentrations decreased inconsistently. Both treatments resulted in hypoestrogenism of the same degree. The steep drop in the serum sex hormone-binding globulin level reflected the androgenic effect of danazol, whereas during nafarelin treatment, serum concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione were reduced. This difference in androgenic milieu may well explain the differences in the lipid profiles. We conclude that, regarding lipid effects, nafarelin is a more favorable treatment for endometriosis than is danazol.\r"

  ".U": "90062411\r", 
  ".W": "Administration of human GH to GH-deficient patients has yielded conflicting results concerning its impact on thyroid function, ranging from increased resting metabolic rate to induction of hypothyroidism. However, most studies have been casuistic or uncontrolled and have used pituitary-derived GH of varying purity, often contaminated with TSH. Therefore, we conducted a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of the effect of 4 months of biosynthetic human GH therapy (Norditropin; 2 IU/m2.day) on thyroid function in GH-deficient adults (8 females and 14 males; mean +/- SE age, 23.8 +/- 1.2 yr). One group (I) was euthyroid without T4 substitution (n = 13), whereas the other (group II) received T4 (n = 9). Serum T4 (nanomoles per L) decreased in both groups after GH treatment [group I, 100 +/- 8 (mean +/- SE) vs. 89 +/- 8 (P less than 0.01); group II, 145 +/- 18 vs. 115 +/- 10 (P less than 0.05)]. Conversely, GH treatment caused an increase in serum T3 (nanomoles per L) in both groups [group I, 1.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.1); group II, 1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.05)]. Similar changes were seen in serum free T4 and T3. The serum T3 level during the placebo period of group I was significantly lower than that in an age-matched reference group (P less than 0.02). Serum rT3 (nanomoles per L) was low in group I and decreased significantly, as in group II, after GH treatment [group I, 0.26 +/- 0.02 (placebo) vs. 0.20 +/- 0.02 (GH; P less than 0.01); group II, 0.38 +/- 0.05 (placebo) vs. 0.29 +/- 0.02 (GH; P less than 0.01)]. Serum TSH decreased in both groups during GH therapy, though not significantly. Serum thyroglobulin was unaltered and did not differ from that in the reference group. In conclusion, our data are consistent with a GH-induced enhancement of peripheral deiodination of T4 to T3. GH thus seems to play an important role, either directly or indirectly, in the regulation of peripheral T4 metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "90062424\r", 
  ".W": "Administration of testosterone (T) can inhibit LH secretion in early pubertal boys. However, the GnRH pulse generator is relatively resistant to the effects of T, since T infusion beginning at 2100 h, 3 h before the usual nighttime increase in T, does not suppress the characteristic increase in LH pulse frequency or amplitude associated with the onset of sleep in early pubertal boys. To test the hypothesis that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis must be exposed to T for a longer duration to suppress the nocturnal rise in LH pulse frequency and amplitude, we infused saline or T at one third the adult male production rate (320 nmol/h), beginning at 1200 h on two consecutive weekends in each of eight early to midpubertal boys. Blood was obtained from 2000-0800 h every 10 min for LH and every 30 min for T measurements. T infusion increased the mean plasma T concentration from 6.9 +/- 1.7 to 11.8 +/- 1.4 nmol/L (P less than 0.01) between 2000-0800 h. Despite the T infusion, the nocturnal rise in mean LH concentration and LH pulse frequency persisted, suggesting that the nocturnal amplification of LH, and by inference GnRH, secretion is resistant to the negative feedback effects of T. A higher dose of T, approximating the adult male production rate (960 nmol/h), was given to eight additional boys beginning at 1200 h. The mean T concentration increased from 4.2 +/- 1.7 to 20.8 +/- 3.1 (P less than 0.001) nmol/L between 2000-0800 h. The mean plasma LH concentration was suppressed by T infusion from 5.2 +/- 0.5 to 2.9 +/- 0.4 IU/L, and LH pulse frequency decreased from 0.50 +/- 0.04 to 0.27 +/- 0.11 pulses/boy/h (P less than 0.01). There was no nocturnal amplification of LH secretion, but high amplitude LH pulses did occur during the night in six of the eight boys. The low dose T infusion had no effect on pituitary LH release by exogenous GnRH. With the high dose T infusion, however, the ability of GnRH, at 25 ng/kg but not at 250 ng/kg, to release pituitary LH was amplified. Thus, T supplementation at one third the adult male production rate does not blunt the sleep-associated nighttime rise in LH pulse frequency or LH concentration. T infusion approximating the adult male production rate suppresses the nocturnal increase in LH pulse frequency and mean LH concentration, and high amplitude, slow frequency LH pulses similar to patterns seen in adult men persist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"
