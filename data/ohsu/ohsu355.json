Drug-abuse treatment results in substantial declines in the use of heroin, cocaine, prescription psychotherapeutic drugs, and other drugs in the year after treatment. Declines are closely related to the length of time spent in treatment; treatment duration of greater than or equal to 6 months has a significant impact on drug use after treatment. The potential impact of drug-abuse treatment in combatting the AIDS epidemic is discussed.\r"

Like some HIV-1 isolates, HIV-2UC1 grows rapidly to high titers in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages and has a differential ability to productively infect established human cell lines of lymphocytic and monocytic origin. Moreover, infection with this isolate also appears to involve the CD4 antigen. However, unlike other HIV isolates, HIV-2UC1 does not cause cytopathic effects in susceptible T cells nor does it lead to loss of CD4 antigen expression on the cell surface. These results indicate that HIV-2 may be found in individuals with neurologic symptoms and that the biological characteristics of this heterogeneous subgroup can differ from those typical of HIV-1.\r"

Human TCR delta diversity was estimated by characterizing rearrangements in TCR gamma delta cell lines and determining the structures of complementary DNA clones representing functional and nonfunctional transcripts in these cell lines. One V delta segment and one J delta segment were identified in all functional transcripts, although a distinct J delta segment was identified in a truncated transcript. Further, one D delta element was identified, and evidence for the use of an additional D delta element was obtained. Thus human TCR delta genes appear to use a limited number of germline elements. However, the apparent use of two D delta elements in tandem coupled with imprecise joining and extensive incorporation of N nucleotides generates unprecedented variability in the junctional region.\r"

It is clear that the consistency of intraoperative myocardial protection must be improved; however, the favorable long-term results for these patients solidify the role of reoperation as an applicable intervention for patients with severe coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

Operative mortality ranges from 0 to 10 per cent, perioperative infarction ranges from 5 to 30 per cent, and patency rates range from 38 to 100 per cent, with 74 to 95 per cent being asymptomatic or improved. This wide discrepancy in clinical outcome occurs for a number of reasons. First, there is nonhomogeneity of patient populations resulting from a lack of standardized patient selection criteria. Second, the operative experience of most published reports spans a decade throughout which major advances in cardiac surgery have occurred. Finally, endarterectomy is a technically challenging procedure with its own learning curve. Differences in technique and expertise almost certainly contribute to the variability of results. Patients with diffuse coronary artery disease pose a challenge to the cardiac surgeon. Endarterectomy entails the risks of increased morbidity and mortality and therefore should be done only if conventional bypass grafting is precluded. However, the risks of these complications must always be weighed against the possible benefits. At the present time carefully selected patients can benefit from this procedure. Unfortunately, until such time as controlled randomized studies are carried out on a prospective basis, statistical support for this procedure will not be available. Given that such a study is questionable from an ethical point of view, clinical decisions for this select group of patients must be done on a case-by-case basis. The best that can currently be done is to carefully follow these patients and scrutinize existing data to ensure optimal clinical management.\r"

In this group, 138 PCNs (130 patients) were performed in 133 kidneys. Forty-seven percent of PCNs were placed in patients with staghorn calculi; 24% were for stones in the renal pelvis, and 20% for ureteral stones. The most common indication for PCN was fever and obstruction (57%). In 15%, the indications were failure to decompress an obstructed system from a retrograde direction, clogged double-J ureteral stents, and perforation of the ureter. Prophylactic PCN placement in the treatment of staghorn calculi and large stones in the renal pelvis accounted for 12%. Five percent were placed for miscellaneous other reasons, and for 11% there was no documentation of the indication because they were placed before the patients came to our center. Localization of the collecting system for optimal placement of PCN is unique in ESWL patients because the residual stone fragments provide natural contrast. This eliminates the need for administration of contrast material in 50% of the patients. Twenty-six percent of PCN tracts were subsequently used for other procedures (e.g., percutaneous nephrolithotomy, fragment irrigation, ureteral stone manipulation). Bleeding complications from PCN occurred in 7%. Other minor complications occurred in 12% of cases. PCN is a useful adjuvant to ESWL treatment of kidney stones. Although its major use is to relieve urinary tract obstruction, it is also used as a preliminary step in planning other percutaneous interventional procedures. This is particularly the case in the treatment of large bulky stones in the renal pelvis and staghorn calculi.\r"

All patients had T1- and two patients had T2-weighted pulse sequences with both coils. Because of the long examination times, T2-weighted sequences in all other patients were obtained by using the double surface coil only. Nine patients underwent radical cystectomy, while the other patients had deep transurethral tumor resection and a clinical follow-up of at least 1.5 years. The results of imaging with the surface coil showed a twofold improvement of spatial resolution compared with the images obtained with the body coil. The RF field homogeneity was excellent, and the field of view was sufficiently large to achieve a complete study of the pelvis and the lower abdomen in one sequence. For the T1-weighted images, the higher spatial resolution of the double surface coil resulted in a significant (p less than .10) improvement in tumor staging. The accuracies of double-surface-coil and body-coil imaging were 79% and 54%, respectively. Double-surface-coil imaging appears to provide better MR images of the urinary bladder than body-coil imaging does, resulting in more accurate staging of tumors on T1-weighted pulse sequences.\r"

These included seven patients with bronchogenic cysts, two with intralobar pulmonary sequestrations, one with scimitar syndrome, and one with bronchial atresia. In each case, MR showed at least some findings indicative of the correct diagnosis. MR proved especially effective in the detection of abnormal fluid collections (nine cases) and the identification of anomalous vessels (three cases). Fluid collections were easily identified in all cases, including four cases with high-density collections on CT (two with bronchogenic cysts and two with intralobar pulmonary sequestration), especially when single-level, multiecho T2-weighted sequences were obtained. Calculated T2 values ranged from 78 to 439 msec (average, 223 +/- 123 msec). Although T2 values were statistically significant for differentiating fluid from muscle (p = .0012) and fat (p = .0046), they were not sufficiently specific to allow precise fluid characterization. Significant limitations were also apparent, such as an inability to detect alterations in the parenchymal architecture of the lungs (three cases) or intrapulmonary vascularity (one case). Despite this, we conclude that MR may be of considerable value in the assessment of congenital pulmonary anomalies and in select cases obviate more invasive diagnostic procedures.\r"

Because both strong magnetic fields and RF energy are used in MR imaging, it has been suggested that capillary blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease may be altered during MR imaging. In order to examine sickle cell blood flow during MR imaging in vivo, laser-Doppler velocimetry was performed in normal control subjects and in sickle cell subjects before, during, and after MR imaging at 0.35 and 1.5 T. Mean blood flow and patterns of blood-flow variability were compared by two hematologists. No differences were found on the recordings from each subject made before, during, and after MR imaging were compared. Blood-flow patterns generally differed between control and sickle cell subjects. Periodic oscillatory blood flow, reportedly a specific finding in sickle cell subjects, was observed in one control subject and was not consistently found in sickle cell subjects. Although energies employed during MR imaging have effects on sickle erythrocytes in vitro, our data show no changes in sickle cell blood flow during MR imaging in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "88238306\r", 
  ".W": "MR imaging has proved to be useful in evaluating large intracranial aneurysms. The parent artery and patent lumen can be identified as flow voids and differentiated from thrombus. However, in the presence of slow flow, even-echo rephasing, and motion artifact, increased intraluminal signal may be present, which may be difficult to distinguish from thrombus. Aneurysms are also dynamic lesions and exert pulsatile mass effect on adjacent structures. Further definition of vascular anatomy and physiology may aid in therapeutic planning and assessment. Cine MR is a new technique using a movie loop of sequential GRASS (gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state) images obtained during various points in the cardiac cycle. The combination of GRASS images and cardiac gating thus allows cinegraphic display of vascular structures. A comparison of this method with routine T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging and angiography was made in a group of 13 patients with intracranial aneurysms greater than 1.5 cm in diameter. Eight of these patients underwent transvascular detachable balloon occlusion. With cine MR, flowing blood has high intensity due to flow-related enhancement. Turbulent and high-velocity flow can be recognized on the basis of signal loss, which occurs during systole. Thrombus demonstrated variable signal intensity, which remained unchanged during the cardiac cycle. Compared with routine MR sequences, there was less image degradation from phase-encoding artifacts and improved visualization of the neck of the aneurysm. Pulsatile mass effect was uniquely assessed. After transvascular embolization, cine MR demonstrated improved conspicuity of acute thrombus and higher contrast between flowing blood and the occlusion balloon when compared with routine MR. Confirmation of flow within the parent vessel, residual aneurysm lumen, and distal arterial branches is possible. If the parent vessel was occluded, cine MR yielded greater information than angiography. Cine MR provides additional anatomic and physiologic data in the evaluation and assessment of therapy of intracranial aneurysms. Information can be obtained that is not available with either routine MR or angiography. The inherent limitations of this new technique include partial-volume artifacts, less than optimal flow-related enhancement or spatial resolution, and poor data acquisition due to cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty patients were examined with and without extra gradient pulses, which compensate for motion-induced phase errors, in order to determine the effect those gradients had in suppressing the motion artifacts frequently present in the brainstem, temporal lobes, and basal ganglionic regions on routine T2-weighted brain MR imaging. Two comparative studies were performed: (1) in 50 patients the motion-artifact suppression technique (MAST) was compared with a single-echo MR examination, and (2) in 10 patients the MAST technique was compared with the second echo of a symmetric dual-echo sequence. In the first study 39 patients were examined at 1.5 T and 11 patients were examined at 0.5 T with the same pulse sequences. We found that MAST resulted in a significant improvement of image quality in 24 of 39 patients on the high-field-strength system and in two of 11 patients on the mid-field-strength system. In the second study, we found that in four of the 10 patients, MAST resulted in a suppression of artifacts greater than that achieved by even-echo rephasing alone. With MAST, artifacts were eliminated that not only obscured normal structures but that could have left doubt about the presence of a true signal abnormality. There was, however, marked suppression of the CSF flow-void phenomenon and increased signal from flowing blood, particularly in the cortical veins and dural sinuses. Because of this, the use of additional pulse sequences in which these motion-compensating gradients were not used was necessary under certain clinical circumstances. We conclude that, with these motion-compensating gradients, artifacts are reduced or eliminated, and a marked improvement in image quality can be obtained without the need for cardiac gating.\r"

  ".W": "The MR imaging studies of 68 patients who had brain anomalies were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate specific anatomic abnormalities of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was abnormal in 32 (47%) of the 68 patients. Excluding patients with the Chiari I malformation, callosal anomalies were present in 30 (68%) of 44 patients. Callosal dysgenesis was most common, followed by callosal atrophy or hypoplasia and complete agenesis. The anterior commissure was present in all patients. On the basis of the known temporal sequence of brain and callosal embryogenesis, we deduced the following regarding the pathogenesis of developmental anomalies: (1) callosal dysgenesis occurs as a result of insults during the formation of its precursors, not during formation of the corpus callosum itself; (2) the Dandy-Walker malformation sometimes occurs as a result of an insult in the eighth week of gestation, several weeks later than has been generally accepted; (3) sphenoidal encephaloceles probably occur as a result of faulty disjunction of neuroectoderm and cutaneous ectoderm at the anterior neuropore; and (4) a complete but atrophic corpus callosum results from an insult to the cortex or white matter after formation of the corpus callosum is complete (18-20 weeks). Callosal anomalies, easily identified on MR, are an important indicator of additional brain anomalies. Analysis of the corpus callosum provides important information about the embryogenesis of brain anomalies and may assist in distinguishing between in utero and perinatal brain insults.\r"

We evaluated the atlantodental interval; basion-dental interval; density or intensity of the dens; dens erosion; cranial settling; anterior, posterior, lateral, or rotatory atlantoaxial subluxation; subaxial subluxation; ligamentous calcification or osteophytes; erosion; cystic changes; joint-space narrowing of the apophyseal articulations; and posterior spinous process erosion. In addition, the cervicomedullary angle and the neuraxis configuration were identified on MR images. To determine its normal range, the cervicomedullary angle was measured in 50 patients whose MR studies were unrelated to the craniovertebral junction. All patients with a cervicomedullary angle less than 135 degrees had evidence of brainstem compression, cervical myelopathy, or C2 root pain. Also, all patients with cervicomedullary junction compression were neurologically abnormal. MR was found to be as good as tomography in evaluating the atlantodental interval, dens erosion, ligamentous calcification or osteophytes of the upper spine, subaxial subluxation, and various subluxations that occur in the occiput-C2 area. MR was less effective than tomography in evaluating the basion-dental interval, erosion of the posterior spinous processes, apophyseal joint disease from C3 inferiorly, and cystic changes of the articular facets of C1-C2. The most clinically important parameters were well seen with MR. The data show that MR is an excellent imaging procedure for evaluating rheumatoid arthritis of the cervical spine.\r"

High-resolution CT is able to show features of the secondary lobule, including interlobular septa, terminal bronchioles, and pulmonary arteries within a bronchiolovascular bundle. Because interstitial diseases have been shown to affect different components of the secondary lobule, high-resolution CT was used to compare the appearance of the normal secondary lobule with the abnormal secondary lobule in three patients with interstitial diseases primarily affecting lymphatic channels: lymphangitic carcinomatosis, sarcoidosis, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. In lymphangitic carcinomatosis, the bronchiolovascular bundles and interlobular septa were thicker than those seen in a normal subject. In sarcoidosis, the interlobular septa and bronchiolovascular bundles were also thicker than normal. However, fibrosis caused distortion of the normal polygonal shape of the secondary lobule, not seen in either the normal subject or the patient with lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis was characterized by multiple cysts within secondary lobules, often obliterating the normal polygonal appearance.\r"

Cineangiography confirmed that 31 patients had CAC (left CAC in 31 patients, right CAC in 11) and that 46 patients had no CAC. For left CAC, the sensitivity of CR was 71%, significantly higher than that of conventional radiography (32%, p less than .01). For right CAC, the sensitivity of CR was only 27%, but that of conventional radiography was 0%. The specificities in detecting CAC were similar for both methods (CR, 96%; conventional method, 100%). Fine anatomic details of calcified foci were seen more clearly on CR. Chest imaging with the CR system is a promising method for detecting CAC.\r"

Although used routinely for calcified lesions, it has not been widely accepted for those abnormalities that do not contain calcium. To determine the efficacy of film-screen specimen radiography for confirming the presence of clinically occult, noncalcified lesions, we undertook a prospective study of 104 specimen radiographs obtained after mammographically guided hookwire localization and planned excision of these lesions. Ninety-seven (93%) of the excised abnormalities were visualized on specimen mammograms. Malignancy was found in 22 (21%) of them. Thirty-five percent of the specimen radiographs showed better anatomic detail of the lesion, 48% showed the same detail, and 16% showed less detail than the original mammograms. Specimen radiographs failed to show the lesion in only seven cases. Five of the seven were true-negative specimen radiographs, making the efficacy rate 98%. Film-screen specimen radiography of clinically occult, noncalcified lesions is a highly effective procedure for correctly identifying the presence of a mammographic abnormality.\r"

Individual patients are heterogeneous with respect to the main determinants that contribute to the development of their symptomatic condition. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs by means of several different mechanisms that vary among patients. In many patients, resting LES tone is normal and reflux occurs via transient LES relaxations. In others with a hypotensive LES, acid reflux occurs mainly as stress of free reflux. Only this latter group is likely to exhibit barium reflux during fluoroscopy. Total esophageal exposure to acid material depends on a number of factors, including the rate of reflux, volume and potency of the refluxate, and efficacy of esophageal acid clearance. Abnormal esophageal exposure to acid refluxate depends on increased gastroesophageal reflux, delayed esophageal clearance, or both. Impaired esophageal acid clearance is generally caused by abnormal esophageal motor function that generally can be detected on barium-swallow examination.\r"

Eighteen of those patients had double-contrast esophagrams, but two were excluded from our study because they had combined fungal and viral esophagitis. All of the remaining 16 patients were symptomatic, and 14 were immunocompromised. Herpes esophagitis was diagnosed on the original radiographic reports in nine (56%) of those 16 patients. In all nine, double-contrast radiographs revealed discrete, superficial ulcers on a relatively normal background mucosa without significant plaque formation. In the remaining seven patients, double-contrast esophagrams revealed plaquelike lesions that were indistinguishable from those of Candida esophagitis (four cases), thickened folds (two cases), and a giant esophageal ulcer (one case). During the same period, herpes esophagitis was diagnosed on seven other double-contrast esophagrams in which histologic, cytologic, and virologic studies were negative for the herpes simplex virus. However, the endoscopic findings were also suspicious for herpes esophagitis in six of those cases, suggesting that they may represent true-positive cases in which there was inadequate tissue sampling. Thus, our experience indicates that radiographic abnormalities can almost always be detected on double-contrast esophagrams in patients with herpes esophagitis, and in more than 50% of cases, a specific radiographic diagnosis can be made because of discrete ulcers without significant plaque formation.\r"

In a retrospective study, signal intensity and morphology were used to establish criteria for differentiating metastases from hemangiomas and cysts. The signal intensity of the lesion alone failed to be an etiologic discriminator because over 96% of all masses had a signal intensity less than that of liver on T1-weighted sequences, and at least 90% had a signal intensity greater than that of liver on T2-weighted sequences. Morphologic features depicted on T2-weighted images were more specific than those depicted on T1-weighted images in differential diagnosis. Amorphous, target, and halo signs and a change in morphology were present only in metastatic disease, with a frequency of 45%, 27%, 13%, and 12%, respectively. Two other morphologic patterns--doughnut and lightbulb signs--were found to have overlapping causes. Overall, at least one of the specific signs was observed in 92% of patients with metastatic disease. These data suggest that T2-weighted pulse sequences are essential for discriminating between hepatic metastases and hepatic hemangiomas and cysts. MR imaging is a promising technique for distinguishing these lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Contrast-enhanced dynamic incremented CT scans in 37 patients with 44 small adrenal masses (28 benign and 16 malignant) were reviewed by two observers unaware of the histologic diagnosis to determine if applying morphologic criteria could help differentiate small benign adrenal masses from malignant adrenal masses. Only lesions smaller than 5 cm with diagnoses confirmed by histology (12 masses) or follow-up (32 masses) were included. Features evaluated to suggest a benign diagnosis were homogeneous low attenuation, possibly with punctate contrast enhancement; an enlarged gland (adrenal configuration maintained); a thin or absent rim; round or oval shape with sharp margins; and diffusely homogeneous attenuation about equal to or greater than that of muscle. Features studied to suggest a malignant diagnosis were a thick enhancing rim, invasion of adjacent structures, irregular or poorly defined margins, and inhomogeneous attenuation. Both observers' diagnoses of benign vs malignant lesions with CT criteria were highly statistically significant. The positive predictive value of a benign diagnosis was 100% for both observers and of a malignant diagnosis was 82% and 62% for the two observers. Evaluated singly, all but three diagnostic criteria were statistically significant in differentiating lesions for both observers; the other three criteria were present in a smaller percentage of patients, but nevertheless had positive predictive values for benignancy of 89-100%. We conclude that experienced observers who use CT criteria can often discriminate accurately between benign and malignant small adrenal masses and, in particular, minimize the number of false-negative diagnoses of adrenal metastases. If these results are confirmed and refined by prospective studies, aggressive diagnostic evaluation can be eliminated in some patients with benign adrenal lesions.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of maintenance oral theophylline therapy on the diagnostic efficacy of dipyridamole-thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for coronary artery disease, dipyridamole-thallium-201 SPECT imaging was performed in eight men with documented coronary artery disease before initiation of theophylline treatment and repeated while these patients were receiving therapeutic doses of oral theophylline. Before theophylline treatment, intravenous dipyridamole caused a significant increase in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, angina in seven of eight patients, and ST segment depression in four of eight patients. While they were being treated with theophylline, none of the patients had angina or ST segment depression, and there were no hemodynamic changes with intravenous dipyridamole. Before theophylline treatment, dipyridamole-thallium-201 SPECT imaging showed reversible perfusion defects in myocardial segments supplied by stenotic coronary arteries. With theophylline treatment, dipyridamole-thallium-201 SPECT showed total absence of reversible perfusion defects. Treatment with theophylline markedly reduced the diagnostic accuracy of dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging for coronary artery disease.\r"

The N-13 ammonia study was performed at rest and after exercise. The F-18 deoxyglucose study was performed at rest after fasting greater than 5 hours. The N-13 ammonia study revealed a hypoperfused area in 19 of the 22 patients (86%), that corresponded to the infarcted regions as diagnosed by electrocardiography, coronary arteriography and left ventriculography (21 patients). The hypoperfused areas expanded after exercise in 16 of 22 patients (73%). F-18 deoxyglucose uptake was observed in these hypoperfused areas, especially in patients with hypokinetic wall motion on left ventriculography and in exercise-induced hypoperfused areas. However, positron emission tomography demonstrated diffuse uptake of F-18 deoxyglucose in 3 of 8 patients with dyskinetic wall motion. Thus, metabolically active myocardium in infarcted areas or periinfarct ischemia can be visualized with F-18 deoxyglucose and stress N-13 ammonia studies.\r"

Sixty-two patients had 2 prior CABG operations, 10 had 3 and 4 had 4. Clinical characteristics included prior myocardial infarctions in 49 (65%), severe angina (class III or IV) in 47 (62%) and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% in 13 (17%). There were 139 lesions dilated: 1 lesion in 39 (51%), 2 in 22 (29%) and greater than or equal to 3 in 15 (20%) patients. Arterial lesions were successfully dilated in 71 of 81 cases (88%), vein grafts in 44 of 53 (83%) and mammary artery grafts in 3 of 5 (60%). In 12 patients, PTCA was used to dilate significant lesions less than 15 days after CABG in vessels which were unable to be bypassed. Significant complications were encountered in 4 patients (5%). These included 3 of 53 vein graft dilatations with embolization (6%), with 1 resulting in infarction and death, and 1 patient dying after emergency CABG. At hospital discharge, 65 patients were clinically improved. An apparent symptom-related lesion recurrence occurred in 23 of 65 patients (35%), with 5 patients dying of cardiac causes, 4 having CABG without previous angiography and 12 of 14 patients undergoing repeat successful PTCA (mean time and standard deviation 9 +/- 6 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) improves exercise-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but its potential for improving resting LV function remains controversial. To assess the influence of CABG on LV function at rest, 31 CAD patients without previous myocardial infarction were studied before and 6 months after CABG by radionuclide angiography after all cardiac medicines were withdrawn. No patient had angina or ischemic electrocardiographic changes at rest. In 27 patients with patent bypass grafts, CABG significantly increased LV ejection fraction during exercise (47 +/- 11% before to 63 +/- 9% after operation, p less than 0.001), indicating reduction in exercise-induced LV ischemia. Moreover, LV ejection fraction at rest also increased (55 +/- 9 to 60 +/- 8%, p less than 0.001), with 20 of 27 patients manifesting an increase compared with preoperative values. Eleven of these 20 patients had apparently normal LV function at rest (ejection fraction and regional wall motion) before CABG. LV regional ejection fraction was computed by dividing the LV region of interest into 20 sectors. Regional analysis indicated that improved ejection fraction at rest after CABG occurred in regions developing ischemia during exercise before CABG. In 4 patients with occluded grafts, the ejection fraction at rest was unchanged by CABG globally (59 +/- 8 to 58 +/- 9%, difference not significant) and regionally. Thus, LV global and regional function at rest improved after successful CABG, even in patients with normal global LV ejection fraction and no visually detectable wall motion abnormality before surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Southern blots of DNA from a panel of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids identified cross-hybridizing adrenodoxin DNA in two loci, chromosome 11q13----qter and chromosome 20cen----q13.1. Examination of adrenodoxin clones from a genomic DNA library in phage lambda revealed some clones bearing gene fragments interrupted by introns and other clones bearing processed pseudogenes. By probing the mouse/human hybrids with unique intronic DNA and by correlating restriction maps of the phage clones with that of uncloned genomic DNA, we show that the authentic transcribed adrenodoxin gene lies on chromosome 11, while pseudogenes lie on chromosome 20.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary orotic aciduria is an autosomal recessive disease in which there is a severe deficiency in the activity of the de novo pyrimidine pathway enzyme uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) synthase. UMP synthase is a bifunctional enzyme containing the two activities orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase, which catalyze the two-step conversion of orotic acid to UMP. Cell lines from three orotic aciduria patients have been characterized for UMP synthase gene and mRNA content. Restriction-enzyme analysis of DNA from the deficient cells revealed no changes in the gene structure compared with normal cell DNA structure. The amount of UMP synthase mRNA was not decreased, nor was there a detectable difference in the size of the UMP synthase mRNA in the deficient cells. Analysis of the mRNA by hybridization with a nearly full-length UMP synthase cDNA followed by S1 nuclease digestion showed no alteration in the mRNA structure. The UMP synthase activity of the deficient cells ranges from 2% to 7% of the normal cell level. The activity can be significantly increased by growing the deficient cells in barbituric acid. Our data indicate that UMP synthase gene transcription in the orotic aciduria cells produces the expected amount of a stable, correctly processed mRNA. The mRNA appears to code for a mutant enzyme that has reduced stability or altered kinetic properties.\r"

The family includes two cases of scleroderma meeting American Rheumatism Association criteria, one of systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma, and two other cases of undifferentiated connective tissue disease with features of scleroderma spectrum disorders; there are also two cases of Raynaud's phenomenon (one associated with rheumatoid arthritis), for a total of seven affected relatives. Evidence of scleroderma spectrum disorders was sought in six siblings of the two co-index cases and in 23 of the 35 offspring. Laboratory studies included antinuclear antibody determinations and typing for the following genetic markers: HLA (A, B, C, DR), complotypes, Gm and Km allotypes, and alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotypes. No common genetic markers restricted to affected members of this family were found, and no environmental exposures were detected that could explain this familial clustering of cases. This report should, however, add to the slowly accumulating information on the genetic characteristics of families at unusually high risk for scleroderma spectrum disorders. Positive antinuclear antibody tests at a titer of 1/40 or higher were present in 57 percent of the first-degree relatives of the affected cases.\r"

CASS has had a major impact on current management of the coronary disease patient and represents an important contribution to the cardiovascular knowledge base. Despite the large size and valuable contributions of CASS, its findings have been widely misinterpreted, especially regarding indications for coronary artery bypass surgery. This review examines CASS from the viewpoint of its methodology and some of its many published reports. A full understanding of CASS is requisite to avoid clinical misapplication of the findings of this study.\r"

Whether administered daily or cyclically, conjugated estrogen was associated with reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The adjusted mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 132 mg/dl for women who used conjugated estrogen in a dose greater than or equal to 1.25 mg/day; the adjusted corresponding mean concentration was 147 mg/dl for postmenopausal women who did not use estrogen. A dose-response pattern was demonstrated between conjugated estrogen and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. A maximum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level reduction was reached at a dose of 1.25 mg, suggesting a saturation phenomenon. Stepwise dose-response increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were also found with estrogen therapy, with a maximum increase of 8 to 10 mg/dl observed with the 1.25 mg dose. Estrogen-related rises in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were offset by 2 to 3 mg/dl in women who smoked. It may be concluded, therefore, that among postmenopausal women, low-risk lipoprotein profiles as assessed by low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are found in nonsmokers whose postmenopausal hormone therapy includes the equivalent of a conjugated estrogen dose of 1.25 mg.\r"

The prevalence of acute anterior uveitis in HLA-B27-positive first-degree relatives of HLA-B27-positive acute anterior uveitis patients was 13% (eight of 63). This is significantly more (P less than .0001) than the frequency of 1% in the normal HLA-B27-positive Dutch population. Ankylosing spondylitis was found in four of 38 (11%) HLA-B27-positive family members over the age of 45 years. This is also significantly more than the prevalence of 1% in a normal HLA-B27-positive Dutch population. Of these four relatives with ankylosing spondylitis, three also had acute anterior uveitis. It was remarkable that two of these four relatives had a proband who had no ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

Histopathologic examination showed marked retinal gliosis, extensive chorioretinal adhesion and scar formation, migration of pigment into the retina, and severe retinal pigment epithelial changes. However, foci of mild to moderate nongranulomatous inflammation of the uvea were observed. These foci contained infiltrating cells that were mainly T lymphocytes with B lymphocyte aggregates at the center. Scattered macrophages were also noted in the uvea and retina. These findings suggest that both the cell-mediated and humoral immune arms may play roles in the pathogenesis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these experiments was to determine the effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside, two compounds used to produce controlled hypotension during surgery, on regional myocardial blood flow. Intracoronary drug infusions in open chest, anesthetized dogs were used to study the direct actions of these agents on the coronary circulation as well as to avoid systemic hemodynamic effects. The actions of the endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators, ATP and nitroprusside, respectively, were studied before and after administration of quinacrine (an inhibitor of phospholipase A2), which blocks formation and/or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Both vasodilators produced significant increases in transmural blood flow of the drug-perfused zone. Only ATP, the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, altered the distribution of myocardial blood flow. Perfusion to the subendocardium was preferentially increased by ATP, resulting in an increase in the subendocardial-to-subepicardial flow ratio. Quinacrine markedly inhibited the increase in endo/epi produced by ATP without changing total flow. These data suggest that ATP increases total coronary blood flow by a mechanism that is independent of EDRF, but the selective redistribution of blood flow to the subendocardium is dependent on EDRF. Nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasodilator, produces no redistribution of myocardial blood flow.\r"

A method for concentrating alveolar casts in sputum specimens might improve the diagnostic usefulness of sputum studies in possible cases of pulmonary infection with Pneumocystis carinii. The use of sputum induction to detect Pneumocystis carinii was studied in 40 consecutive patients with known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus infection having bronchoscopy for evaluation of pulmonary disease. Sputum produced by deep coughing induced by 3% saline via a jet nebulizer was liquefied with dithiothreitol, and cells were sedimented and stained. Liquefaction of mucus allowed concentration of alveolar casts where P. carinii cysts were readily identified. A total of 28 patients were found to have P. carinii, which was detected in concentrated sputum in 21 of 38 patients, unconcentrated sputum in 10 of 38 patients, and by bronchoscopy in 25 of 37 patients. Sensitivity of concentrated sputum compared with bronchoscopy was 78% (95% CI, 58 to 90), with a negative predictive value of 71% (95% CI, 47 to 87). Values for unconcentrated sputum were 43% (95% CI, 25 to 63) and 48% (95% CI, 30 to 67), respectively. Liquefaction of adequately induced sputum facilitates processing and interpretation and increases yield for P. carinii, eliminating the need for invasive procedures in most patients.\r"

The extent of activation was assessed on the basis of percentage difference images following normalization to compensate for global shifts. The somatosensory stimulus elevated lCMRGlc by 16.9 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- standard deviation) and lCBF by 26.5 +/- 5.1% in the contralateral sensorimotor cortical focus; smaller increments were noted in the homologous ipsilateral site. The increments of lCMRGlc and lCBF correlated poorly with one another in individual subjects. Stimulation of the right hand resulted in significantly higher contralateral lCMRGlc activation (19.6%) than did stimulation of the left hand (14.1%) (p less than 0.005), whereas the lCBF response was independent of the hand stimulated. Our results indicate that both glycolytic metabolism and blood flow increase locally with the execution of an active sensorimotor task and suggest that both measures may serve as reliable markers of functional activation of the normal brain.\r"

In those patients who were noted at the time of coagulation to have flushed there were marked elevations of the local (cranial) levels of both peptides. However, in the nonflushing patients no changes in the peptide levels were observed. Parallel experiments in the cat revealed that the levels of substance P-like and CGRP-like immunoreactivity were increased during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. The observation of elevation of substance P-like and CGRP-like immunoreactivity after activation of the nociceptive afferent system of the head provides new insights into a putative role of peptides in the pathophysiology of migraine and cluster headache, and suggests new areas of possible therapeutic intervention.\r"

The diagnosis of OPCA was based on the history and physical findings and on the exclusion of other causes of cerebellar ataxia by means of laboratory investigations. Computed tomographic scans revealed some degree of atrophy of the cerebellum in most patients with OPCA, and many also had atrophy of the brainstem. PET studies in these patients revealed significant hypometabolism in the cerebellar hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, and brainstem in comparison with the normal control subjects. A significant relationship was found between the degree of atrophy and the level of 1CMRglc in the cerebellum and brainstem. Nevertheless, several patients had minimal atrophy and substantially reduced 1CMRglc, suggesting that atrophy does not fully account for the finding of hypometabolism. 1CMRglc was within normal limits for the thalamus and cerebral cortex. The data suggest that PET/1CMRglc may be useful as a diagnostic test in patients with the adult onset of cerebellar ataxia.\r"

The role of opiate receptors and endogenous opioid peptides in seizure mechanisms is well developed and is the basis for measuring opiate receptors in patients with epilepsy. Patients with complex partial seizures due to unilateral temporal seizure foci were studied by positron emission tomography using 11C-carfentanil to measure mu-opiate receptors and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose to measure glucose utilization. Opiate receptor binding is greater in the temporal neocortex on the side of the electrical focus than on the opposite side. Modeling studies indicate that the increase in binding is due to an increase in affinity or the number of unoccupied receptors. No significant asymmetry of 11C-carfentanil binding was detected in the amygdala or hippocampus. Glucose utilization correlated inversely with 11C-carfentanil binding in the temporal neocortex. Increased opiate receptors in the temporal neocortex may represent a tonic anticonvulsant system that limits the spread of electrical activity from other temporal lobe structures.\r"

The effects of temperature, osmolarity, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and digitonin on gentamicin binding were assessed. The affinities of several aminoglycosides for binding sites were tested. Gentamicin bound to cochlear and vestibular structures in a rapid and saturable fashion at a single class of noninteracting binding sites with Kds of 1.2.10(-6) and 3.10(-7) M and maximal binding capacities of 1.3 nmol and 43 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. In the liver, spleen, and heart, binding remained low and appeared to be nonspecific. In the organ of Corti, gentamicin uptake was unaffected by alterations in temperature or medium osmolarity or by 2,4-dinitrophenol, indicating that the uptake represented binding and not active transport. Digitonin at 10 nM increased markedly the uptake at 37 and 4 degrees C, suggesting the presence of internal binding sites. Various aminoglycosides compete for a common binding site.\r"

Trimethoprim resistance was transferred from two Tmpr H. influenzae isolates to a Tmps strain by conjugation or transformation. Wild-type Tmpr strains and Tmpr transcipients did not contain detectable plasmid DNA. The trimethoprim resistance gene was cloned into a cosmid vector, and recombinant plasmids were transduced into Escherichia coli. A 0.50-kilobase intragenic probe derived from a 12.9-kilobase fragment which encoded trimethoprim resistance hybridized with whole-cell DNA from Tmps and Tmpr strains. Southern blot analysis of restricted DNA from isogenic Tmps and Tmpr H. influenzae indicated that acquisition of trimethoprim resistance involved a rearrangement or change in nucleotide sequence. Hybridization was not seen with DNA derived from Tmpr E. coli containing dihydrofolate reductase I, II, and III genes or with Tmpr Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas cepacia. Southern hybridization with 12 multiply resistant encapsulated H. influenzae strains confirmed that the trimethoprim resistance gene was chromosomally mediated. Dihydrofolate reductase activity was significantly greater in cell sonicate supernatants of Tmpr strains in comparison with isogenic Tmps recipients. Differences were not found in the trimethoprim inhibition profile of dihydrofolate reductase activity in Tmps and Tmpr strains. We conclude that the mechanism of trimethoprim resistance in H. influenzae is overproduction of chromosomally located dihydrofolate reductase.\r"

Binding of [35S]penicillin G to H. influenzae PBPs 3a and 3b was drastically reduced at 42 degrees C, while PBP 1a showed a temperature-modulated increase in penicillin binding. Further investigation revealed that growth at 42 degrees C causes altered electrophoretic mobility of PBP 3a on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and that cell labeling performed at 42 degrees C showed the differential penicillin binding to target proteins. All Haemophilus spp. tested showed a similar temperature modulation of penicillin binding. Growth measurement and cell viability studies performed at 42 degrees C permitted correlation of PBP 3 temperature sensitivity to H. influenzae resistance to moxalactam at 42 degrees C, and the probable correlation of PBP 1a increased penicillin binding to the more rapid antibacterial activity of penicillin G against H. influenzae at 42 degrees C. Microscopic examination of Haemophilus cells grown at 42 degrees C revealed filamentous cell formation, supporting a role of PBP 3 in the septation process. Results of this study demonstrate that wild-type H. influenzae strains (and possibly all other Haemophilus spp.) possess PBPs 1a and 3, which have distinct and opposite temperature-modulated penicillin-binding activities.\r"

High-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used to determine concentrations in plasma and urine of estolate, ethylsuccinate, and erythromycin base. The maximum concentration of drug in the serum, the half-life, and the area under the curve for erythromycin estolate were significantly greater than those of erythromycin ethylsuccinate after both regimens. After single and multiple doses, the respective areas under the curve of erythromycin base generated by estolate formulation were 3 and 1.6 times greater (P less than 0.05) than those of ethylsuccinate. The lower percentage of hydrolysis of erythromycin estolate (41 versus 69%) combined with its longer half-life (5.47 versus 2.72 h) and its larger area under the curve (30.61 versus 4.68 micrograms/h/ml, after multiple doses) could explain these differences. This study underscores the need for a specific high-pressure liquid chromatography assay and the importance of wide variability, rate-limited processes, changes with multiple doses, and the appearance of a second peak when one studies the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin esters. The pharmacokinetic data presented in this study reinforce the clinical advantages of erythromycin estolate over erythromycin ethylsuccinate.\r"

In 15 patients, an excellent (total clearing) or good response (marked reduction of all lesions) was seen. In seven of them, acitretin was superior to previous therapy with antimalarials and/or systemic corticosteroids. In particular, five of six patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus showed complete clearing of their lesions, usually within two to four weeks.

  ".W": "Since 1971, 70 patients have been seen at Emory University Hospital with gastroesophageal varices secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Thirty-seven of these patients had had prior major operative therapy. In only three patients (8%) was shunt surgery successful, and there was a high incidence of rebleeding, other morbidity, and mortality. Of especial note are the serious consequences of simple splenectomy; splenomegaly and thrombycytopenia should rarely, if ever, be used as indication for splenectomy in portal hypertension. In 1977, the use of selective distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) was begun at Emory in this population and a selective shunt has been possible in 24 of 29 patients (83%) who had had no prior operative therapy. Results have been excellent with a greater than 90% patency rate, long-term portal perfusion in all, no encephalopathy, and late rebleeding in one patient. Quantitative studies at 3-6 years show stability of liver function, significant decrease in spleen size, and rise in platelet count. However, long-term follow-up (greater than 15 years) is required in PVT patients before definitive assessment can be obtained. A specific problem of the PVT patient is late shunt stenosis which requires close observation; dilatation of the shunt was performed in six of the 24 patients with a patent shunt. Poor results with non-shunt operative procedures in PVT were again documented. The proper role of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy is not yet clear, but appears to be an excellent addition to the therapeutic options. In conclusion, for patients with a patent splenic vein, initial therapy should be a selective shunt; for patients without a patent splenic venous system, endoscopic sclerotherapy is the procedure of choice.\r"

Sixty-two patients with symptoms of coronary artery insufficiency underwent carotid endarterectomy prior to or at the time of CABG (Group I). Ninety-seven patients had asymptomatic carotid bruits but did not undergo carotid endarterectomy (Group II). Sixty of these patients were studied by ultrasonic duplex scanning or ocular pneumoplethysmography or both, and hemodynamically significant stenosis was detected in 50 (Group IIa). Group III included 80 patients without carotid artery disease matched with Group II for sex, age, and clinical status. Group IV consisted of 200 patients without carotid artery disease randomly selected from our series. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 120 months (median, 41 months). In patients with proven carotid artery disease (Groups I and IIa), operative mortality was greater than in the patients randomly selected (Group IV) (p less than 0.05) but similar to that in the matched Group III. Late neurological deficits were greater in patients with carotid disease not undergoing carotid endarterectomy (p less than 0.01). Patients with carotid artery disease had lower survival than Group IV patients (p less than 0.01) but similar survival to that in the matched Group III. This study suggests that (1) asymptomatic patients with carotid artery disease who undergo CABG are not at increased risk of perioperative stroke; (2) these same patients are at increased risk of late neurological deficit; and (3) carotid artery disease is an indirect sign of severe associated disease and therefore is associated with increased operative mortality and decreased life expectancy.\r"

The muscle was conditioned over a six-week period subsequent to operation in 3 patients and was conditioned preoperatively with a burst stimulus in the fourth. Biopsy specimens confirm the experimental data that human skeletal muscle can be electrically conditioned over a six- to ten-week period to contain mainly fatigue-resistant type I fibers. All patients survived the procedure, and 3 showed improvement secondary to aneurysmectomy. In Patient 1, a modified resection was performed, and at 28 months after operation, at the 75-W level of exercise, the ejection fraction was 54% paced versus 45% nonpaced. In Patient 2, at 12 months, the ejection fraction at rest was 44% paced versus 30% nonpaced. Doppler echo studies confirmed the presence of the flap and its function in the paced and nonpaced mode. The third patient died of a sudden ventricular arrhythmia 2 months following operation. An infected, nonfunctioning, degenerated flap was found at autopsy. Patient 4 did not have an aneurysm. She received a bypass graft to the right coronary artery and underwent cardiomyopexy in an attempt to relieve medically refractory incapacitating chronic congestive heart failure. Ten months postoperatively, ejection fraction at rest was 33% paced versus 25% nonpaced. Constrictive myopathy has not been encountered in any of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "To enable long-term studies of a totally implantable cardiac assist device powered by transformed fatigue-resistant skeletal muscle, we developed a dual-chamber extraaortic counterpulsator implanted, 2 of which fluid for power transfer. Six dogs had our dual-chamber extraaortic counterpulsator implanted, 2 of which had undergone prior transformation of their latissimus dorsi muscle. The blood pump, with a Dacron graft at each end, was anastomosed end-to-side and parallel to the thoracic aorta, allowing continuous blood flow to minimize thrombus formation caused by stasis and turbulence. The blood pump was powered by a hydraulic bulb placed beneath the latissimus dorsi muscle. The latissimus dorsi muscle was stimulated to contract during diastole using a synchronized burst electrical stimulator. The ratio of diastolic pressure time product over systolic time tension index, which reflects the myocardial oxygen supply and demand ratio, was calculated from ascending aortic pressure tracings. A consistent increase in this ratio of 44% in 4 dogs with nontransformed latissimus dorsi muscle and of 70% in 2 dogs with transformed latissimus dorsi muscle was obtained when the device was activated. Preliminary chronic implantation studies using a Medtronic cardiomyostimulator (Model SP1005) as the burst stimulator for our dual-chamber extraaortic counterpulsator produced an average augmentation in aortic diastolic pressure of 34 mm Hg for up to six days. Our results indicate that, with further refinement of this device, a long-term totally implantable cardiac assist device powered by endogenous skeletal muscle will be feasible.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines whether the duration of treatment with antipsychotic drugs influences the regional distribution of cerebral [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose utilization as measured by positron emission tomography. Two groups of schizophrenic patients are compared with normal volunteers (n = 10). One group (n = 5) consisted of patients treated for one year, and the second (n = 12) of patients medicated for four to 14 years (mean +/- SD duration, 7.4 +/- 3.4 years). The first group was also examined before patients received their first dose ever of antipsychotic medication. One year of medication was not sufficient to alter the schizophrenic profile of cerebral cortical glucose activity but did elevate activity of the corpus striatum. Medication for 7.4 years also did not alter the schizophrenic pattern of frontal hyperactivity and posterior hypoactivity, although deviations from control values appeared less marked than after one year. On the other hand, in patients medicated for 7.4 years, there was perhaps an even greater increase in the activity of the corpus striatum and of the thalamus. Thus, duration of exposure to antipsychotic medication may affect the pattern of cerebral glucose activity; possibly, even longer exposure may contribute to the hypofrontality noted by others, although this can be confounded with the duration of illness as a factor. In considering the biological significance of the observed profile of cortical glucose activity, we introduce the concept of cerebral metabolic tone. We suggest that a disturbance of this tonus may account for some symptoms of schizophrenia and could be consistent with the hypothesis of abnormal developmental changes in the brains of schizophrenics.\r"

This CRF hypersecretion is believed to contribute at least in part to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in depressed patients. If CRF is chronically hypersecreted in depressed patients, then, due to down-regulation, a reduced number of CRF receptor binding sites should be present in patients with profound depressive disorder. To test this hypothesis, we measured the number and affinity of CRF binding sites in the frontal cortex of 26 suicide victims and 29 controls who died of a variety of causes. There was a marked (23%) reduction in the number of CRF binding sites in the frontal cortex of the suicide victims compared with the controls. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CRF is hypersecreted in depression.\r"

This phenomenon appears to represent another facet of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Histologically, the majority of these lymphomas have been small noncleaved cell lymphomas or immunoblastic lymphomas, subtypes most commonly associated with a B-cell phenotype, but immunologic data supporting this have been limited. Using a plastic embedding technique, we have examined a series of 31 malignant lymphomas, including nine from the central nervous system (CNS), in patients with AIDS or at high risk for AIDS. All 31 of the lymphomas were positive with one or more of the following B-cell markers: HLA-DR/la, Pan B, Leu 12, Leu 14, and IgM. All 31 were negative for the pan-T reagent Leu 4 and myeloid-macrophage markers (Leu M1, nonspecific esterase). In addition, seven of the nine CNS lymphomas showed strong plasma membrane staining for adenosine triphosphatase, a B-associated marker. These findings provide strong immunologic evidence for a B-cell origin in the lymphomas of AIDS.\r"

The control group received continuous passive motion without quadriceps electric stimulation. Both groups engaged in physical therapy consisting of active range of motion, quadriceps femoris setting, flexion and extension stretches, and ambulation. Manual goniometry and tensiometry were used to evaluate knee active extension range of motion and quadriceps strength. Upon dismissal, the stimulated group was able to generate more force at 90 degrees, 35 degrees, 20 degrees, and terminal extension of the involved knee, but none of these values was found to be statistically significant. Active extension range of motion of the stimulated group on dismissal showed a significant decrease in active extension lag (degrees) as compared to the control group. The experimental group averaged ten days in the hospital as compared to 12.5 for the control group, and subjectively noted decreased pain during stimulation.\r"

In 23 SLE patients who were followed serially, the mean C3a value was 179 ng/ml during stable disease and 550 ng/ml during a disease flare. In 10 patients, C3a levels predicted disease activity, with the C3a value rising from a mean of 183 ng/ml at a time of stable disease to a mean of 242 ng/ml 1-2 months prior to a clinical exacerbation of disease. The mean C3a level in 5 patients with acute dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) was 1,297 ng/ml, which is significantly higher than that observed in patients with active disease but without CNS involvement (P less than 0.01). C5a levels were also significantly elevated in 4 patients with acute CNS disease. Pathologic specimens from 2 patients who died during an acute lupus flare revealed neutrophils occluding the cerebral and intestinal vessels. Fluorescein angiography in a patient with CNS lupus revealed vasoocclusive retinopathy. In 5 of 7 SLE patients who were pregnant, C3a levels were elevated, with a group mean value of 310 ng/ml. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.59) between C3a and C3 levels in pregnant patients with SLE, and this finding is consistent with complement activation as the cause of decreasing C3 levels. We suggest that serial measurements of C3a can predict flares of disease in lupus patients and can demonstrate complement activation during pregnancy in women with SLE. In addition, release of C3a and C5a (mediators of inflammation) into the circulation may elicit vascular injury, particularly in patients with lupus cerebritis.\r"

The percentage of B cells that demonstrated increased expression of CD5 was 46% in SS patients, 47% in rheumatoid arthritis patients, 24% in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, and 26% in normal subjects. Over a 2-year period, CD5 expression on B cells was a stable finding in several patients, except for 2 who required either steroid therapy or combined chemotherapy and irradiation for malignant lymphoma. Both of these patients had clinical remissions and their levels of CD5+ B cells returned to normal. The first patient had a clinical picture of SS/systemic lupus erythematosus overlap, associated with polyclonal B cell activation and decreased production of interleukin-2 in response to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. These cellular immune abnormalities returned to normal after the institution of corticosteroids. Our observations suggest a relationship between the CD5+ B cell abnormality and disease activity. The results are discussed in relation to immunoregulatory properties of CD5+ B cells in autoimmune mice and the characteristic predisposition to malignant lymphoma among SS patients.\r"

We conclude that, in GCA patients, association with DR4 is mainly related to the manifestation of the disease as PMR.

The formation of anti-nDNA antibodies and immune-mediated disease syndrome appeared to be dose-dependent, even in cats in which a response had been induced on 4 prior occasions.

Satisfactory induction of anaesthesia was produced with both drugs and opioid supplementation prevented any marked haemodynamic response to skin incision and to sternotomy. Following induction of anaesthesia, sufentanil produced the greater decrease in mean arterial pressure and left ventricular stroke work index which continued throughout the study.

While under treatment the patient had significant improvement but not complete regression of retinitis. Electron microscopic and immunofluorescent techniques revealed cytomegalovirus particles in the retina, sclera, iris, and ciliary body. These findings are consistent with a virostatic type of inhibition of CMV by this agent. They also suggest that CMV involvement in the eye and other organs may be more widespread than is clinically apparent in AIDS patients.\r"

Although the pathogenesis of these lesions remains unclear, in animals it appears that increased vascular permeability precedes development of grossly visible lesions. We examined the effect of aspirin administration on gastric vascular permeability in eight healthy subjects. We used gastric accumulation of Evan's blue dye (which is bound to albumin) as a marker of vascular integrity and assessed gastric accumulation of Evan's blue, blood, and DNA during serial 10-min washes. Both bleeding and Evan's blue in the gastric washings increased with time after administration of aspirin in an acid solution (P less than 0.01). Evan's blue increased from a median value of 8 micrograms/10 min to 24.5 micrograms/10 min period after 60 min of aspirin administration. By 20 min after aspirin administration, the accumulation of Evan's blue in the gastric wash was significantly greater than the initial aspirin period (P less than 0.05). Blood loss increased from 147 to 650 micrograms Hgb/10-min period. The increase in bleeding rate did not become significant until 40 min after the first aspirin dose. Our study showed that aspirin-induced gastric mucosal damage can be detected by assessing accumulation of Evan's blue in the gastric contents after aspirin administration. Studies in which various doses of aspirin or other agents are administered will be required to confirm whether the increased vascular permeability actually precedes bleeding in man. Measurement of Evan's blue dye in the gastric contents appears to provide a qualitative (and possibly quantitative) and sensitive early index of gastric mucosal injury.\r"

The prevalence of peptic ulcer among patients on hemodialysis therefore appeared to be no higher than that in the general population.

Historically cirsoid aneurysm most often occurs in the stomach, but has been reported to occur in the jejunum. In this paper, four cases are presented that are felt to represent the first documented cases of cirsoid aneurysm involving the duodenum. At endoscopy, the appearance of Dieulafoy's lesion may range from a pinpoint dot, clot, or tortuous vessel, to blood oozing or spurting from normal mucosa. A shallow defect may be present that can give the appearance of a partially healed peptic ulcer. Previous histologic studies have shown a wide-caliber-persistent artery with intimal thickening, sclerosis, and medial muscular hypertrophy. Once the diagnosis is made, surgical intervention utilizing simple ligation of the involved vessel results in cessation of recurrent hemorrhage. Dieulafoy's lesion is probably more common than the previous literature would suggest. The lesion needs to be considered in the clinical setting of the patient with massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a paucity of symptoms, and negative findings on barium studies, endoscopy, and exploratory laparotomy.\r"

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is produced in vivo by peripheral blood monocytes and tissue macrophages stimulated with endotoxin and has been shown to activate PMN's and vascular endothelial cells. To determine whether the inhibition of airway edema is mediated by TNF, guinea pigs were treated with intravenous saline or 75,000 U/kg recombinant human TNF 1.5 h before exposure to air or 3 ppm TDI for 1 h. Animals were then injected intravenously with 50 mg/kg Evans blue dye as a marker of protein extravasation. Saline-treated animals exposed to TDI had a significant increase in tracheal Evans blue dye extravasation (85 +/- 6.5 micrograms dye/g trachea, mean +/- SE) compared with saline-treated animals exposed to air (31.3 +/- 2.5, P less than 0.001). The tracheal extravasation of Evans blue dye was significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05) in TDI-exposed animals treated with TNF (64.7 +/- 7.5). Neither heat-inactivated TNF (104.9 +/- 9.5) nor TNF neutralized with a monoclonal antibody against TNF (99.7 +/- 17.9) inhibited TDI-induced airway edema. In addition, treatment with 15,000 U/kg (99.9 +/- 21.3) or 150,000 U/kg (103.2 +/- 17.6) interleukin 1, a monokine also produced in response to endotoxin, did not prevent airway edema. These results suggest that TNF released in response to endotoxin mediates endotoxin's inhibition of a PMN-dependent airway edema.\r"

Fifty mg of verapamil was added to the priming solution for cardiopulmonary bypass, and A-C bypass surgery was successfully performed without the occurrence of perioperative coronary spasms even though severe episodes of spasm had been documented before surgery. However, four cases of vasospastic angina not receiving verapamil developed coronary spasms during or after A-C bypass surgery. It was concluded that administration of verapamil, a potent calcium entry blocking agent, is effective in preventing perioperative coronary vasospasms. Patency of the saphenous vein grafts bypassing the spasm-related coronary arteries was satisfactory.\r"

In contrast, patients with the classical forms of CAH frequently develop adrenal insufficiency, characterized by elevated plasma ACTH and low serum cortisol levels. To examine the various components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with LOCAH, we studied 12 patients with this disorder (10 females and 2 males; age range, 51/2-36 yr). Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), and androstenedione (Adione) concentrations were measured after administration of ovine CRH (oCRH); 1 micrograms/kg at 2000 h) and in the unstimulated state (every 30-60 min for 24 h). The patients' oCRH-stimulated ACTH, cortisol, and Adione responses did not differ from those of normal subjects, whereas their serum 17-OHP concentrations were elevated both basally and after oCRH (P less than 0.05). The patients' unstimulated 24-h ACTH and cortisol levels were normal and exhibited normal diurnal variability. Cortisol pulse frequency was normal. The patients' unstimulated serum 17-OHP levels exceeded those in the normal subjects at all times (P less than 0.01) and exhibited diurnal variability paralleling that of ACTH and cortisol. Unstimulated serum Adione levels in 4 adult women were in the normal or low normal range, except between 0200-0730 h when they were moderately elevated (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the ACTH-cortisol component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is in normal equilibrium in this group of patients with LOCAH. Because serum Adione levels were elevated only briefly, we suggest that peripheral tissue conversion of 17-OHP to androgens may be the primary cause of the hirsutism and acne in these patients.\r"

It then decreased during the first 3 days postpartum to 1.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/L (n = 28), in parallel with changes in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and protein concentrations. However, between the first and sixth weeks postpartum, the IGF-I concentration increased to 2.5 +/- 0.2 nmol/L (n = 18), while levels of EGF and protein decreased further. Given that the volume of milk produced increases during this period, the total IGF-I output rose by up to 4-fold, while EGF output remained constant. The increase in IGF-I and decrease in EGF in milk suggest that different regulatory mechanisms control the output of different growth factors by the mammary gland.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the relation between regional myocardial perfusion and regional wall motion in humans, tomographic thallium-201 imaging and two-dimensional echocardiography at rest were performed on the same day in 83 patients 4 to 12 weeks after myocardial infarction. Myocardial perfusion and wall motion were assessed independently in five left ventricular regions (total 415 regions). Regional myocardial perfusion was quantitated as a percent of the region infarcted (range 0 to 100%) using a previously validated method. Wall motion was graded on a four point scale as 1 = normal (n = 266 regions), 2 = hypokinesia (n = 64), 3 = akinesia (n = 70), 4 = dyskinesia (n = 13) or not evaluable (n = 2). Regional wall motion correlated directly with the severity of the perfusion deficit (r = 0.68, p less than 0.0001). Among normally contracting regions, the mean perfusion defect score was only 2 +/- 4. Increasingly severe wall motion abnormalities were associated with larger perfusion defect scores (hypokinesia = 6 +/- 5, akinesia = 11 +/- 7 and dyskinesia = 18 +/- 5, all p less than 0.01 versus normal. Among regions with normal wall motion, only 3% had a perfusion defect score greater than or equal to 10. Conversely, among 68 regions with a large (greater than or equal to 10) perfusion defect, only 13% had normal motion whereas 87% had abnormal wall motion. The relation between perfusion and wall motion noted for the entire cohort was also present in subgroups of patients with anterior or inferior infarction. In patients with prior myocardial infarction, the severity of the tomographic thallium perfusion defect correlates directly with echocardiographically defined wall motion abnormalities, both globally and regionally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid (IPPA) is a synthetic long chain fatty acid with myocardial kinetics similar to palmitate. Two hypotheses were tested in this study. The first hypothesis was that IPPA imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is useful in the identification of patients with coronary artery disease. Fourteen normal volunteers (aged 27 +/- 2 years) and 33 patients (aged 54 +/- 11 years) with stable symptomatic coronary artery disease and at least one major coronary artery with luminal diameter narrowing greater than or equal to 70% were studied with symptom-limited maximal exercise testing. The IPPA (6 to 8 mCi) was injected 1 min before the termination of exercise, and tomographic imaging was performed beginning at 9 min and repeated at 40 min after the injection of IPPA. Nine of the normal volunteers and 13 of the patients had a second examination performed at rest on another day. Using the limits of normal as 2 SD from the normal mean values, 27 of the 33 patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated abnormalities in either the initial distribution or the clearance of IPPA, or both. Nineteen of the 33 patients had a maximal variation of activity distribution of greater than or equal to 25% on the 9 min IPPA images. Twenty-two of the 33 patients had a maximal variation in IPPA washout greater than 17% and 17 had a washout rate less than or equal to 2%. There was good agreement between the location of significant coronary artery stenoses and abnormalities in the initial distribution and clearance of IPPA. The second hypothesis tested was that IPPA imaging is as or more sensitive and, therefore, complementary to thallium-201 imaging in the identification of exercise-induced ischemia in patients. Twenty-five of the 33 patients underwent both thallium-201 and IPPA tomographic imaging after symptom-limited maximal exercise testing. The amount of exercise performed by each patient during both studies was similar. Twenty-one of the 25 patients had abnormal IPPA tomographic studies, whereas 18 had abnormal thallium-201 tomographic studies (p = NS). The results of this study suggest the following conclusions: 1) iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid imaging using single photon emission computed tomography and exercise provides a sensitive and relatively noninvasive method for identifying abnormalities in myocardial metabolism associated with significant coronary artery stenoses, and 2) iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid is at least as sensitive as thallium-201 for this purpose using tomographic imaging and exercise testing.\r"

With use of N-13 (nitrogen-13) ammonia and F-18 (fluorine-18) deoxyglucose as tracers of blood flow and exogenous glucose utilization and positron emission tomography, hypoperfused areas were noted at rest and during exercise in all 11 patients (100%) with Q wave infarction. Among the 11 patients with non-Q wave infarction such areas were noted in only 5 (45%) at rest and in 8 (73%) during exercise. Furthermore, segmentally enhanced F-18 deoxyglucose uptake corresponding to the infarcted areas (identified electrocardiographically) was seen in 10 (91%) of the 11 patients with non-Q wave infarction but in only 4 (36%) of the 11 patients with Q wave infarction (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, segmental F-18 deoxyglucose uptake as a possible sign of myocardial viability was seen more frequently in non-Q wave than in Q wave infarction and, importantly, regionally enhanced F-18 deoxyglucose uptake occurred even in the absence of segmental rest or exercise blood flow abnormalities, or both, in 5 (45%) of 11 patients with non-Q wave infarction.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 15 children with recurrent infections and normal serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgG-subclass levels. After immunization, the geometric mean serum IgG antibody concentration to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was eightfold lower than that of age-matched control subjects (p = 0.002). The patients also had a lower geometric mean concentration of serum IgM and IgA directed to Hib, although these differences did not reach significance. However, the groups did not differ in their response to diphtheria toxoid and pneumococcal polysaccharides. To confirm these findings, an additional 11 patients were identified and immunized. The geometric mean serum IgG anti-Hib concentration for this group of patients was also significantly lower than of normal subjects (p = 0.004). We propose that the defect in the antibody response to Hib may be a marker for a poor antibody response to a variety of bacterial and viral antigens that results in an increased propensity to recurrent infections. The defect was not associated with IgG-subclass deficiency. The identification of children with selective antibody deficiency and recurrent infections is important for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons.\r"

  ".W": "T cell-depleted C3H/He or (C57BL/6xC3H/He)F1 (B6C3F1) mice were prepared by adult thymectomy and injection of antithymocyte serum, followed 3 wk later by lethal x-irradiation and bone marrow reconstitution. When these T cell-depleted mice were not injected or injected i.v. with normal spleen and lymph node cells treated with either anti-Thy-1, -L3T4 or -Lyt-2 antibody plus C or C alone, none of the groups of mice developed thyroiditis. In contrast, the adoptive transfer of normal cells treated with anti-Lyt-1 plus C resulted in high incidence of the production of antithyroglobulin antibody and the induction of typical thyroiditis lesion. The thyroid was the sole organ involved, because neither typical inflammatory lesion in other organs nor autoantibody such as anti-DNA antibody was detected in mice that exhibited thyroiditis. Analyses of surface phenotypes of cells required for inducing thyroiditis by the adoptive transfer revealed that an appreciable percentage of Lyt-1 dull T cells remained after the treatment of normal lymphoid cells with anti-Lyt-1 plus C. Almost all of these Lyt-1 dull T cells expressed magnitudes of L3T4 or Lyt-2 Ag comparable to those detected on Lyt-1 bright T cells. More important, the induction of thyroiditis was almost completely prevented by either in vitro or in vivo elimination of Lyt-1 dull L3T4+(bright) but not of Lyt-1 dull Lyt-2+(bright) T cells. These results indicate that Lyt-1 dull L3T4+ T cells existing in normal healthy individuals have potential to induce typical thyroiditis which is associated with the production of antithyroglobulin autoantibody, and that the activation and/or function of this T cell subset is regulated by the Lyt-1 bright T cell population coexisting in normal lymphoid cell population.\r"

  ".U": "88244377\r", 
  ".W": "IL-1 is a pleiotropic factor encoded for by at least two genes, alpha and beta, and capable of eliciting a broad set of immunologic and inflammatory events. MRL/MP-lpr (MRL-lpr) mice are an appealing model for studies of renal injury inasmuch as disease in this strain is spontaneous, rapid, predictable, and regulated by the lpr gene. Infiltration of macrophages and the proliferation of the glomerular mesangial cells are prominent features of renal disease. Because both mesangial cells and macrophages can synthesize IL-1, the purpose of this study was to determine whether enhanced IL-1 gene expression is associated with lupus nephritis in the MRL-lpr mouse model. Glomerular macrophages, abundant in the kidneys of MRL-lpr mice but rarely present in the kidney of congenic MRL/MP-++(MRL-++) mice, were isolated and cultured and found to express a 10-fold increase in both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA transcripts as compared with MRL-++ and MRL-lpr mesangial cells. IL-1 alpha was not detected in the total RNA extracted from freshly excised kidney, whereas IL-1 beta transcripts were detected in both the renal cortex of MRL-lpr as well as MRL-++ animals. A previously undetected truncated 1200 nucleotide IL-1 beta transcript together with the conventional 1600 nucleotide IL-1 beta transcript was found in kidneys from MRL-lpr and was abundantly expressed in glomeruli of MRL-lpr mice with lupus nephritis. Isolated glomeruli from MRL-lpr mice with nephritis produce IL-1, whereas in normal glomeruli from MRL-++ and C3H/FeJ mice this cytokine was not detected. Glomerular macrophages and mesangial cells cultured from MRL-lpr mice with nephritis both secrete IL-1. These studies indicate that IL-1 beta gene expression and IL-1 protein are increased in the kidneys of autoimmune mice with lupus nephritis and is generated, at least in part, by glomerular macrophages. We speculate that an alteration in IL-1 beta gene expression may be responsible for causing a cascade of events leading to acute and chronic renal injury.\r"

Eight subjects received five daily infusions (0.2 mg/kg/day) of either anti-T11 (CD2) or anti-T4 (CD4) murine mAb. It was found that in vivo anti-T cell mAb infusions specifically suppress in vitro measurements of the human immune response; anti-T11 mAb blocked T cell activation via the CD2 SRBC-binding protein, and anti-T4 mAb infusions abolished PWM-induced Ig synthesis without lysis of the CD4+ T cell subpopulations. With repeated infusions of the anti-T11 mAb in three subjects, anti-mouse antibodies were found in the circulation. Although the majority of human anti-mouse antibody was not isotype specific, significant anti-idiotypic-like activity was observed after repeated infusions in two of three subjects. The human anti-mouse antibodies were almost exclusively of the IgG isotype. The magnitude of the human anti-mouse response was significantly less after administration of either anti-T11 or anti-T4 as compared with anti-T12 mAb. Murine anti-T cell mAb can provide a specific, benign form of acute immunosuppression in humans. However, repeated administration of these reagents in more chronic diseases can result in anti-Id-like antibodies that block binding of the anti-T cell mAb to the T cell surface.\r"

These LAg1-thymocytes do not become CTL when incubated with Con A or Con A plus mouse rIL-2, whereas unseparated thymocytes and thymocytes with high levels of surface sialic acid develop good levels of polyclonal CTL activity under these conditions. However, LAg1- thymocytes developed high levels of CTL activity when incubated with B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1), provided as the supernatant of the rBSF-1-secreting T cell hybridoma D9-C1.12.17. Affinity-purified BSF-1 from D9-C1 supernatant and rBSF-1 also stimulated these cells to become CTL, but they were not as active as the D9-C1 supernatant. The ability of D9-C1 supernatant and of affinity-purified BSF-1 to induce CTL activity was inhibited by the anti-BSF-1 mAb 11B11. Moreover, this mAb inhibited the ability of 24-h Con A-stimulated spleen cell supernatant to induce these cells to express CTL activity. 11B11 also inhibited LAg1+ thymocytes from becoming CTL when stimulated with Con A alone. These experiments suggest that BSF-1 is required for LAg1- and LAg1+ thymocytes to become CTL.\r"

To further study this process, we evaluated the effects of IL-2 (1000 U/ml) on normal donor PBMC incubated for 1 h on cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells (EC). Although the NK activity of non-adherent PBMC recovered from flasks coated only with fibronectin increased in the presence of supplemental IL-2, the activity of cells recovered from flasks coated with EC decreased when IL-2 was added to the medium. The percentage of NK (CD16+) cells among the EC-non-adherent PBMC was reduced relative to that of the input cells when IL-2 was added. The percentage of CD16+ cells in the EC-adherent PBMC, as well as their NK activity, increased in the presence of added IL-2. Although EC had no effect on the lysis of labeled K-562 cells by unstimulated PBMC in cold target competition experiments, they were able to compete in cytolytic assays using PBMC previously activated by exposure to IL-2 for 1 h. EC were not lysed by these briefly activated PBMC in 3-h cytotoxicity assays but were lysed by these effectors in 18-h assays and in 3-h assays using PBMC pre-activated by more prolonged culture with IL-2. The ability of IL-2 to induce NK cell adhesion to EC was not blocked by a mixture of neutralizing antisera raised against rTNF-alpha, rIL-1 alpha, and rIL-1 beta, factors known to promote leukocyte adhesion to EC. We conclude that IL-2 rapidly induces NK cell adhesion to EC and propose that this effect accounts for the disappearance of circulating NK cells after the infusion of high doses of IL-2. In addition, these results suggest that NK cells activated by IL-2 in vivo may injure the endothelium and contribute to the extravasation of plasma and the retention of fluid characteristic of IL-2 treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed to characterize the toxic effects of human rIL-2 in mice and to examine the mechanism of toxicity. Intraperitoneal administration of rIL-2 at doses greater than or equal to 2 X 10(6) U/kg twice each day for greater than or equal to 4 days led to toxicity in several strains of mice. The toxic effects of rIL-2 included the vascular leak syndrome (manifested by pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and ascites), elevated hepatic transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, pre-renal azotemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mild eosinophilia, and death. Marked lymphoid cell infiltration of pulmonary and hepatic vasculature was present in mice suffering from rIL-2 toxicity, and the pleural and ascitic fluids also contained high numbers of mononuclear cells. Mononuclear cells isolated from the pleural fluids and livers of these mice were 74 to 98% Thy-1+, 55 to 83% asialo-GM1+, 29 to 45% Lyt-2+, and less than 10% L3T4+. These cells possessed potent lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-like activity in that their ability to lyse cells of the NK-resistant P815 mastocytoma line was 10- to 100-fold higher on a per cell basis than splenocytes from the same animals. A correlation was found between the dose level, duration, and frequency of dosing with rIL-2 required to induce pleural effusions and hepatotoxicity and the dosage regimens required to produce the LAK-like cells in the pleural cavities and livers, respectively, of rIL-2-treated mice. Moreover, treatment of mice with anti-asialo-GM1 (anti-ASGM-1) antiserum in vivo at the same time they were receiving toxic doses of rIL-2 abolished or greatly reduced the severity of the vascular leak syndrome and hepatotoxicity and significantly prolonged the survival of the mice. Administration of anti-ASGM-1 to mice receiving toxic doses of rIL-2 resulted in a marked reduction in the LAK-like cytolytic activity of their pleural and liver lymphoid cells and a corresponding reduction in the percentage of ASGM-1+ cells in pulmonary and hepatic lymphoid infiltrates. Nevertheless, the overall extent of pulmonary and hepatic lymphoid infiltration, as well as other consequences of rIL-2 administration, including splenomegaly, hypoalbuminemia, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia, were not diminished as a result of anti-ASGM-1 treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Reactive T cells are present in both the CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. This determinant, however, is not expressed on growth factor-independent T cell lines. After activation of mononuclear cells by either Con A or PHA, greater than 80% of the cells stained at a mean fluorescence intensity that was more than six times that seen on resting cells. When PWM- or mixed lymphocyte reaction-activated cultures were studied, 7 to 22% of S152+ cells stained at high intensity whereas most cells stained at the baseline low intensity. The increased fraction of S152+ cells staining at high intensity after activation paralleled both the increased percentage of anti-Tac+ and 5E9+ cells and cellular proliferation measured by thymidine incorporation. Modulation of the S152 Ag was induced when either Con A- or PHA-activated mononuclear cells were placed into secondary cultures containing S152 mAb. Expression of the S152 Ag began to decrease after 2 h and reached a minimum after 6 h. Resting T cells, however, did not appear to modulate when cultured with S152 mAb. Immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the S152 molecule to have a mobility of 120 kDa before reduction. After reduction the molecule was shown to be composed of two 55-kDa molecules with an isoelectric point of 5 to 6 indicating that the S152 Ag is a disulfide-linked homodimer. These studies confirm that the S152 mAb reacts with the newly defined CD27 molecule. The presence of the S152 Ag on resting and activated cells, its parallel increase with the Tac and 5E9 Ag, and its ability to modulate on activated cells suggest that this molecule may play a functional role during T cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "88244401\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past 35 yr, diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been the most widely used agent for the treatment of filarial diseases, particularly in onchocerciasis. The microfilaricidal action of DEC has been recently shown to be mediated by blood platelets with the additional triggering of a filarial excretory Ag (FEA). This FEA could be detected by using mAb in the serum of infected patients. By using one mAb (IA2(23] directed against Onchocerca volvulus and recognizing circulating Ag (Ab1), we purified by affinity chromatography the target molecule of IA2(23) (an O. volvulus glycoprotein recognized by IA2(23) mAb). This compound had a dose-dependent effect on the cytotoxic action of DEC-treated platelets. We subsequently produced an anti-idiotype mAb to Ab1 (Ab2), and considered the possibility of replacing the O. volvulus glycoprotein recognized by IA2(23) mAb by Ab2. Ab2 was selected according to its ability to inhibit the binding of radioiodinated Ab1 to the filarial target Ag. It induced the production of anti-O. volvulus antibodies (Ab3) in rats. At a constant concentration of DEC platelets, the addition of increasing amounts of Ab2 led to a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against parasite larvae. Experiments performed with Ab2 on detergent solubilized surface proteins of platelets identified four bands of Mr 18, 26, 43.5, and 100 kDa, supporting the idea of the presence of binding sites on the platelets for a FEA required for the microfilaricidal cytotoxicity of DEC-treated platelets.\r"

  ".W": "Human rIL-4 was studied for its capacity to induce lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity. In contrast to IL-2, IL-4 was not able to induce LAK cell activity in cell cultures derived from peripheral blood. IL-4 added simultaneously with IL-2 to such cultures suppressed IL-2-induced LAK cell activity measured against Daudi and the melanoma cell line MEWO in a dose-dependent way. IL-4 also inhibited the induction of LAK cell activity in CD2+, CD3-, CD4-, CD8- cells, suggesting that IL-4 acts directly on LAK precursor cells. IL-4 added 24 h after the addition of IL-2 failed to inhibit the generation of LAK cell activity. Cytotoxic activity of various types of NK cell clones was not affected after incubation in IL-4 for 3 days, indicating that IL-4 does not affect the activity of already committed killer cells. No significant differences were observed in the percentages of Tac+, NKH-1+ and CD16+ cells after culturing PBL in IL-2, IL-4 or combinations of IL-2 and IL-4 for 3 days. IL-4 also inhibited the activation of non-specific cytotoxic activity in MLC, as measured against K-562 and MEWO cells. In contrast, the Ag-specific CTL activity against the stimulator cells was augmented by IL-4. Collectively, these data indicate that IL-4 prevents the activation of LAK cell precursors by IL-2, but does not inhibit the generation of Ag-specific CTL.\r"

  ".W": "The B cell surface Ig molecule plays an important regulatory role in delivering inductive/tolerogenic signals to the cell. In this paper, the effect of Ag and anti-idiotopic antibodies on the in vitro proliferation and Ig secretion of a B cell tumor was studied. The tumor (BCL1), which had been transfected with the TEPC-15 VH and VL Ig genes, expresses surface Ig and secretes antibody that binds the hapten phosphorylcholine. We found that Ag (C polysaccharide and phosphorylcholine carrier Ag) and two different anti-idiotopic antibodies, in the absence of T cells, all inhibited the proliferation of the T15+ transfectant cell line. The anti-idiotopic antibodies, but not Ag, also inhibited the secretion of T15 Ig by this cell line, suggesting different functional roles for Ag vs anti-Id in the regulation of B cell inactivation. The inhibition of secretion and proliferation appears to be cell cycle phase related. In addition, mouse rIL-4 could override the inhibition of proliferation induced in these studies. These phenomena, demonstrating that binding of surface Ig can result in the transduction of negative growth signals to a B cell tumor, can be viewed as a manifestation of immunologic tolerance. These findings collectively demonstrate that Ag and anti-Id mediate different signals to B cells via interaction with the surface Ig. Because of the monoclonal nature of the T15 transfectant and the anti-idiotypic antibodies, this system can be used to investigate the underlying molecular reactions involved in the B cell response and induction of tolerance.\r"

Functional analysis of the Lyt-2+, Ly-6C.2- and Lyt-2+, Ly-6C.2+ subsets demonstrated that both cell types responded in class I and class II allogeneic MLC as well as in virus-specific cell-mediated cytolysis assay, although precursor frequency analysis suggested that the majority of precursor CTL were Ly-6C.2+. The marker did not appear to represent an activation Ag because Ly-6C.2-, Lyt-2+ precursor CTL generated Ly-6C.2-, Lyt-2+ CTL. Finally, virtually all splenic Lyt-2+ T cells from athymic (nu/nu) mice were Ly-6C.2+ whereas all thymic CTL were Ly-6C.2-.

We have analyzed the effect of removing the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 molecule on the ability of the CD4 molecule to enhance T cell responsiveness. The cytoplasmic domain-deleted mutant of the CD4 molecule (CD4 delta) was found to be as efficient as the CD4 molecule at enhancing responsiveness to cells bearing the appropriate Ag. If subcellular Ag in the form of purified Ag incorporated into liposomes was used, the CD4 molecule was found to be much more efficient than the CD4 delta molecule at enhancing responsiveness. However, the defect in the ability of the CD4 delta molecule to enhance responsiveness could be compensated for by increasing the level of expression of the CD4 delta molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Syngeneic mice immunized with tobacco mosaic virus protein (TMVP) can differ with respect to their ability to produce antibodies that bind a decapeptide epitope representing residues 103 to 112 of TMVP, and with respect to the fine specificity of the decapeptide binding antibodies as determined by their ability to bind several synthetic analogues of the decapeptide. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the differences between the syngeneic animals in their ability to make anti-decapeptide antibodies, spleen cells from a large number of naive CSW mice were pooled, and aliquots were transferred (either including or excluding resident T cells) into naive recipients that were subsequently immunized with TMVP. Examination of the frequency and fine specificity of anti-decapeptide antibodies revealed that the recipients exhibited various clonalities of decapeptide binding antibody responses similar to those seen in a normal population of CSW mice. Moreover, the response of each individual mouse was of a restricted clonality despite the availability of a more extensive repertoire of decapeptide-recognizing clones. The results indicate that the selection of the clonality of the antibody response was not determined by the presence (or absence) of particular clones of B or T cells and that the mechanism responsible for generating differences between mice must have acted, subsequent to introduction of the Ag, by activation of a limited number of clones randomly selected by Ag and/or by Ag-driven mutation. The long term nature of the antibody response to the decapeptide epitope was also investigated. The response was shown to be \"locked-in\" for the life of the immunized individual. Thus, individuals that responded to TMVP but that did not produce antibodies to the decapeptide after the first set of immunizations with TMVP maintained their non-responsiveness to the decapeptide after the second set of immunizations with the protein. However, individuals that responded to an initial set of immunizations with TMVP by producing antibodies to the decapeptide epitope continue to produce antibodies to the decapeptide after a second set of immunizations with TMVP. The fine specificity of the decapeptide-binding antibodies also appeared to be \"locked in\" throughout the life of the immunized individual. The long term maintenance of the clonability of the antibody response does not appear to be influenced by Ag-specific T cells and is strictly a function of memory B cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "T cell subsets that regulate antibody responses to L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT) in mice that are Ir gene non-responders have been further characterized. We previously defined several T cell subsets in GAT-primed non-responder mice. The Lyt-2+ suppressor-effector T cells suppress responses to GAT and GAT complexed to methylated BSA (GAT-MBSA). The Lyt-1+ cell population is complex and can be separated into I-J- Th cells, which support responses to GAT and GAT-MBSA. After priming, the Lyt-1+, I-J+ cell population contains suppressor-inducer cells that activate precursors of suppressor-effector cells to suppress responses to GAT and GAT-MBSA as well as Ts cells that directly inhibit responses to GAT but not GAT-MBSA. By contrast, the Lyt-1+ cells from virgin mice contain only cells that directly suppress responses to GAT but not GAT-MBSA. The major question addressed in the present studies was whether the Lyt-1+, I-J+ Ts cells in virgin and primed mice and the suppressor-inducer cells in GAT-primed mice were functionally and serologically distinct subsets. The studies used mAb and panning procedures to separate cell populations and inhibition of PFC cell responses to functionally define the activity of the cell populations. We used the following two mAb that were raised by immunizing rats with GAT-specific suppressor factors: 1248A4.10 (known to react with suppressor-inducer cells) and 1248A4.3, another reagent from the same fusion. Lyt-1+ cells from virgin spleens contained Ts cells that were A4.10-, A4.3+ and no suppressor-inducer T cells, whereas Lyt-1+ cells from GAT-primed spleens contained Ts cells that were A4.10-, A4.3+ as well as A4.10+, A4.3- suppressor-inducer cells. Thus, the Lyt1+, I-J+ cell subset can be divided into two functionally and serologically distinct subsets, direct Ts cells (1248A4.3+), which suppress responses to GAT but not GAT-MBSA, and GAT-primed suppressor-inducer T cells (1248A4.10+).\r"

  ".W": "It has been assumed, without direct evidence, that T cell hybridomas and non-transformed T cell clones are both good models of normal Ag-specific T cells. To compare directly the difference in activation of cloned normal T cells and T hybridoma cells with the same TCR, cloned T hybridoma cells were obtained by fusing pre-established, myoglobin-specific, Iad-restricted T cell clones (14.5 and 9.27) with BW5147 cells. T cell clones were pre-activated with IL-2 as well as specific Ag before fusion. Cloned T hybridoma A3.4C6 was derived from Lys 140-specific and I-Ed-restricted clone 14.5. The other cloned T hybridoma, C7R14, was a fusion product of Glu 109-specific and I-Ad-restricted clone 9.27. Both T hybridomas showed the same Ag specificity and Ia restriction as the parental cloned T cells. However, C7R14 showed higher apparent affinity and broader cross-reactivity than 9.27. Clone 14.5, but not hybridoma A3.4C6, appeared to stimulate splenic cells to secrete cytokines inhibiting HT-2A cell proliferation. The most striking difference between the clones and hybridomas was that both clones, but neither of the matched hybridomas, were induced to synthesize IL-1 on stimulation with Ag. Finally, both cloned T cells and T hybridomas killed Ag-pulsed Iad-bearing B lymphoma target cells. This evidence suggests that killing function can be inherited from clones to hybridomas. However, the clones were much more efficient at killing than the hybridomas, and the hybridomas were more efficient at IL-2 production than the clones. Thus, matched pairs of clones and hybridomas differ in their capacity to mediate the two functions or may tend to be selected differently during cloning. Thus, although our results generally support the validity of T cell hybridomas as faithful models of the corresponding T cell clones, a number of subtle and not-so-subtle differences indicate that caution must be used in such an extrapolation.\r"

The female NZB/W F1 nu/nu mice did not develop autoimmune kidney disease, whereas all of nu/+ female littermates mice exhibited proteinuria and died of renal failure with a 50% survival time of 35 wk. Namely, nude mice had no signs of proteinuria up to the time of their death caused by other diseases rather than glomerulonephritis, and their mean survival time was greater than 45 wk. Nude mice had also no anti-ssDNA antibody in their serum. However, splenic B cells of NZB/W nude mice exhibited hyper-responsiveness to both LPS and B151-TRF2, a T cell-derived polyclonal B cell-stimulation factor, and produced large numbers of Ig-secreting cells and anti-TNP plaque-forming cells as well as anti-ssDNA antibody comparable to the nu/+ littermate mice. Interestingly, thymus-engrafted NZB/W nude mice developed autoimmune disease exemplified by the induction of anti-ssDNA antibody and proteinuria at approximately the same time as their nu/+ littermates. These results indicate that the B cell hyper-responsiveness found in NZB/W mice is apparently determined by the T cell-independent process, and T cells are obligatorily required for the development of autoimmune disease in NZB/W mice.\r"

The penetration of rIL-2 across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier was studied in 12 cancer patients who had no evidence of tumor involvement of the central nervous system. At different times during treatment with intravenous rIL-2, CSF was withdrawn either continuously for 8 to 26 hours via a lumbar subarachnoid catheter (in eight patients) or by a single lumbar puncture (in four). Bioassay showed the appearance of rIL-2 in lumbar CSF 4 to 6 hours after the first intravenous dose, a rise over 2 to 4 hours to a plateau of 3 to 9 U/ml, and clearance to less than 0.1 U/ml by 10 hours after the last dose. An abnormally elevated CSF albumin level in two of the twelve patients indicated alteration of the blood-brain barrier. There were no abnormalities in the CSF glucose level or white blood cell count. The CSF pharmacokinetics contrast with the rapid elimination of rIL-2 from plasma and demonstrate significant blood-CSF barrier penetration. These data support the possibility of achieving CSF levels of rIL-2 that are adequate to maintain activity of lymphokine-activated killer cells after parenteral administration, and argue for rIL-2-associated disruption of the human blood-brain barrier in some patients.\r"

The bias would arise if demented patients who fall are relatively unavailable to community surveys due to death or institutionalization. To test this hypothesis, a \"dose-response\" relationship between falls and cognitive impairment was tested for using data from a longitudinal cohort study of 157 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. In a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data, when 96% of the cohort were community residents, the association between falls and cognitive impairment was insignificant (odds ratio for a 10-point change in Mini-mental State score = 1.2, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.9). Yet cognitive impairment at baseline predicted falls during three-year follow-up (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Both severity of dementia and falls were risk factors for death or institutionalization. Patients at highest risk for leaving the community during follow-up were those who became non-ambulatory. The authors conclude, based on longitudinal data, that there is a dose-response effect between cognitive impairment and falls. Transfer bias probably obscured the association at baseline. These data emphasize the importance of prospective studies of falls.\r"

They label this effect \"clinic patient bias.\" It is a variation of prevalence-incidence (Neyman) bias in that it also results from the time gap between the onset of a specific characteristic (a risk factor, exposure or disease) and enrollment in the study, causing selective exclusion of fatal or short episodes, or mild or silent cases. Clinic patient bias may distort an estimate of relative risk in either direction. The empirical example is derived from a study of risk factors for developing complications such as peritonitis among end-stage renal disease patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The use of available clinic patients rather than an inception cohort (patients newly beginning CAPD) resulted in the demonstration of false apparent risk relationships for two variables: the calendar date when patients began CAPD (with those enrolled at an earlier time appearing to be at lower risk), and serum albumin level at the start of CAPD (with those having lower albumin levels appearing to be at higher risk). This example demonstrates one of the potential hazards of using active or available clinic patients as a source of subjects for clinical studies.\r"

The validity of the RAI was established in comparisons to the Arthritis Helplessness Index. The external criterion validity of the RAI was established by identification of statistically significant correlations between RAI scores and physical measures of disease status, including joint count, grip strength, walking time, and button test, as well as with questionnaire self-report scores for difficulty, dissatisfaction and pain in activities of daily living (ADL). Any variation in RAI scores which could be explained by available disease status measures was explained entirely by ADL self-report scores, with no additional explanation by traditional physical measures. Responses to individual RAI statements were significantly correlated with either questionnaire or physical measures of disease status for only 6 of the 15 RAI statements.\r"

The serum propeptide level and the relative urinary excretion of hydroxyproline as polypeptides were related to the extent of cutaneous involvement. Elevated serum propeptide and hyaluronan values were seen in patients who progressed within the following 6 months. Patients with CREST syndrome had normal propeptide values. Reduced renal propeptide clearance is a likely cause of high serum levels of propeptide degradation products demonstrated in PSS. Serum propeptide seems to be a useful novel marker for disease activity and progression in PSS because of its linkage to the actual connective tissue metabolism.\r"

Patients at greater risk for hypoglycemia also included those who had received pentamidine previously and those who experienced azotemia during treatment.

  ".W": "The intracellular concentration and rate of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) synthesis, as measured by adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, were measured in dermal fibroblast cultures, colon cancer lines, and cells cultured from colonic epithelium and colonic adenomas. Dermal fibroblasts had higher AC activity and intracellular cAMP levels than the colon cancer lines (p less than 0.05). Benign colonic epithelial cultures (mucosa and adenomas) had AC levels similar to those found in dermal fibroblasts. To characterize further these observed differences, similar measurements were made in cultures incubated in cholera toxin (CT) or epidermal growth factor (EGF). CT stimulated AC activity and cAMP accumulation in both cancers and fibroblasts. EGF had no effect on AC activity in cancers or fibroblasts, and no effect on cAMP concentration in cancer, although EGF incubation did increase intracellular cAMP in fibroblasts. Dermal fibroblasts from colon cancer-prone patients had AC activity and cAMP concentration not significantly different, though greater, than fibroblasts from healthy individuals. Therefore, although the product of the oncogene associated with colon cancer has been shown to be an activator of AC in yeast, in human colon cancer, AC activity and intracellular cAMP concentration were much lower than in dermal fibroblasts. This difference was so great that AC activity and intracellular concentration of cAMP might be biochemical markers that can be used to differentiate colon cancer from benign cells in tissue culture.\r"

  ".U": "88246501\r", 
  ".W": "Nonclassic steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a frequent, relatively mild disorder of cortisol biosynthesis, characterized by variable signs of postnatal androgen excess. It is inherited as an allelic variant of the gene designated CYP21B, which encodes 21-hydroxylase. CYP21B is located in the HLA histocompatibility complex, and a \"nonclassic\" allelic variant is often associated with characteristic HLA antigens--B14,DR1. We cloned and analyzed the CYP21B gene from a patient homozygous for HLA-B14,DR1 who had nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Five deviations from the normal genetic sequence of CYP21B were found, but only one appeared likely to affect the functional integrity of the protein: codon 281, GTG, encoding valine, was changed to TTG, leucine. We constructed an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the mutant DNA sequence surrounding codon 281 and hybridized the probe with DNA samples digested with the restriction endonuclease Taql. Samples from eight patients with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency who had the haplotype HLA-B14,DR1 contained a hybridizing fragment 3700 base pairs long, indicating the presence of the valine-281 mutation in the CYP21B gene. In contrast, unaffected subjects and one patient with nonclassic deficiency who did not have HLA-B14,DR1 had no evidence of this mutation. We conclude that the mutation in codon 281 is a consistent molecular genetic marker for nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency associated with HLA-B14,DR1.\r"

  ".W": "Cobalamin deficiency has well-known hematologic and neurologic effects, but little is known about its other effects. We therefore studied the effect of cobalamin on osteoblast-related proteins. We found that mean (+/- 1 SD) levels of skeletal alkaline phosphatase in the blood were lower in 12 cobalamin-deficient patients (3.89 +/- 2.19 units per liter) than in 5 nondeficient and 5 iron-deficient control subjects (7.55 +/- 3.99 units per liter). The degree of the megaloblastic anemia correlated with the reduction in skeletal alkaline phosphatase levels (r = 0.67, P less than 0.01). With cobalamin therapy, levels of skeletal alkaline phosphatase rose in 11 of the 12 cobalamin-deficient subjects but not in the controls. The cobalamin-deficient patients also had significantly lower osteocalcin levels than the control subjects (1.11 +/- 0.77 vs. 1.84 +/- 0.49 nmol per liter). During cobalamin therapy, these levels rose in the cobalamin-deficient patients but not in the controls. In contrast to the levels of osteoblast-related proteins, hepatic alkaline phosphatase levels were similar in the patients and controls and were usually unaffected by cobalamin therapy. In vitro studies of calvarial cells from chicken embryos showed that their alkaline phosphatase content was cobalamin-dependent, thus supporting our in vivo observations in humans. Our findings suggest that osteoblast activity depends on cobalamin and that bone metabolism is affected by cobalamin deficiency, but we do not yet know whether cobalamin deficiency produces clinically important bone disease.\r"

Usually there is no need for signal averaging, and the method is independent of the effect of muscle relaxants. With the use of the same electrophysiological equipment as for evoked potential neuromonitoring, immediate and repeated localization of the facial nerve and its discrimination from the trigeminal and the lower cranial nerves during nerve preparation within the tumor capsule is possible.\r"

Pain classified as primary nociceptive was effectively alleviated (P greater than 0.001) while neuropathic deafferentation pain was not significantly influenced by morphine or equivalent doses of other opioids. Also 'idiopathic' pain, defined as chronic pain with no or little demonstrable pathology, failed to respond. The results were not related to whether the patients were regular users of narcotic analgesics or not. The outcome of our double-blind opioid test has proved useful to justify a continued, or discontinued, use of narcotic medication in individual patients. It may also support the indication and choice of invasive stimulation procedures (spinal cord or brain). The results of the study illustrate the misconception of chronic pain as an entity and highlight the importance of recognizing different neurobiological mechanisms and differences in responsiveness to analgesic drugs as well as to non-pharmacological modes of treatment. The opioid test has thus become a valuable tool in pain analysis and helpful as a guide for further treatment.\r"

The HIV-1 LTR contained in this recombinant adenovirus responds to trans-activation by tatIII in a HeLa cell line constitutively expressing that HIV-1 gene product. In addition, the HIV-1 LTR is activated by the adenovirus E1A 13S, but not 12S or 9S, gene product when it is supplied in trans by a coinfecting wild-type adenovirus. The Rous sarcoma virus LTR, in a similar recombinant adenovirus, is insensitive to tatIII but is also trans-activated by the E1A 13S protein. The action of the 13S E1A and tatIII proteins are additive for the HIV-1 LTR in the context of adenovirus and they appear to act at the transcriptional level. As in HeLa cells, the adenovirus-borne HIV-1 LTR is inactive in the absence of a trans-activator in H9 and Jurkat cells, two human leukemic T-cell lines. This suggests that recombinant adenoviruses have diagnostic potential for the detection of trans-activators of the HIV-1 LTR that are present in circulating human lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "cDNA clones encompassing the complete coding sequence for the female-specific rat liver microsomal 15 beta-hydroxylase have been isolated and sequenced. This cytochrome P-450 species (P-450 15 beta) has a total of 490 amino acid residues, and its deduced amino acid sequence as well as direct sequencing of the amino-terminal portion of the purified protein revealed its identity with P-450 i. P-450 15 beta was found to be 66% similar to the male-specific rat liver microsomal 16 alpha-hydroxylase, P-450 16 alpha. Furthermore, P-450 15 beta is 47% similar to the major phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 in rat liver, P-450 b, while its structural similarity to P-450 c, P-450 pregnenolone-16a-carbonitrile, and P-450 lauric acid omega-hydroxylase is less than 30%. However, the developmentally regulated cytochromes P-450 f and P-450 PB-1 both have 68% similarity to P-450 15 beta. It is therefore concluded that P-450 15 beta belongs to the same gene subfamily (P450IIC) that also includes cytochromes P-450 f, PB-1, and 16 alpha. The plasma pattern of growth hormone (GH) is known to be a major determinant for the sex-specific expression of P-450 15 beta and P-450 16 alpha. Continuous infusion of GH to hypophysectomized male rats causes an increase in P-450 15 beta mRNA after 6 days of treatment, while intermittent injections have no effect. On the other hand, no effect on P-450 16 alpha mRNA is observed after continuous administration of GH, while intermittent injections cause an increase after 2 days of treatment. This relatively long period before P-450 15 beta and P-450 16 alpha mRNA induction is seen might indicate that protein factors mediating GH action are involved.\r"

The second human liver clone (HL-1) is encoded by a separate gene, and RNA gel blot analysis indicates that both mRNAs are expressed similarly in several human clonal cell lines.

  ".W": "The chemical reactivity of thymine (T), when mismatched with the bases cytosine, guanine, and thymine, and of cytosine (C), when mismatched with thymine, adenine, and cytosine, has been examined. Heteroduplex DNAs containing such mismatched base pairs were first incubated with osmium tetroxide (for T and C mismatches) or hydroxylamine (for C mismatches) and then incubated with piperidine to cleave the DNA at the modified mismatched base. This cleavage was studied with an internally labeled strand containing the mismatched T or C, such that DNA cleavage and thus reactivity could be detected by gel electrophoresis. Cleavage at a total of 13 T and 21 C mismatches isolated (by at least three properly paired bases on both sides) single-base-pair mismatches was identified. All T or C mismatches studied were cleaved. By using end-labeled DNA probes containing T or C single-base-pair mismatches and conditions for limited cleavage, we were able to show that cleavage was at the base predicted by sequence analysis and that mismatches in a length of DNA could be readily detected by such an approach. This procedure may enable detection of all single-base-pair mismatches by use of sense and antisense probes and thus may be used to identify the mutated base and its position in a heteroduplex.\r"

  ".W": "Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP21B gene. This gene and a highly homologous pseudogene, CYP21A, alternate with the C4A and C4B genes encoding the fourth component of complement. Classical deficiency alleles are frequently caused by deletions of CYP21B or by gene conversions that transfer deleterious mutations from the CYP21A pseudogene to CYP21B. Gene conversions involving restriction enzyme sites that distinguish CYP21A [e.g., 3.2-kilobase (kb) Taq I fragment] and CYP21B (3.7-kb Taq I fragment) might be confused with actual deletions of CYP21B. To determine the incidence of this type of gene conversion, 15 chromosomes (in 13 families) with absent 3.7-kb Taq I fragments were studied. When hybridized with a 21-hydroxylase probe, all of these chromosomes were associated with absent 2.9-kb Kpn I fragments, 14 of 15 were associated with absent 2.4-kb Bgl II/EcoRI fragments, and 13 of 15 were associated with absent 10-kb Bgl II/EcoRI and 12-kb EcoRI fragments. Thirteen of 15 chromsomes had absent 6.0- or 5.4-kb Taq I fragments when hybridized with a C4 probe. Thus, 2 of 15 chromosomes do not carry deletions and may represent gene conversions; 13 of 15 chromosomes studied have a deletion of approximately equal to 30 kb, leaving behind the C4A gene and a single CYP21A-like gene. Hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes showed that in all 13 cases this remaining CYP21 gene carried an 8-base-pair deletion, typical of CYP21A, that prevents synthesis of a functional protein. Thus, gene conversions are rarely confused with deletions as a cause of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "When a helper T-cell (TH) clone specific for the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, matrix protein, or nucleoprotein of influenza strain A/PR/8/34 is adoptively transferred to athymic mice 1 day after virus infection the anti-viral antibody response of the mouse is enhanced. This response is directed predominantly to the hemagglutinin and requires associative T-cell-B-cell interactions. Delaying transfer of the TH clone has three consequences: (i) the onset of the anti-hemagglutinin antibody response is delayed; (ii) the titer of the anti-hemagglutinin response is reduced; and (iii) the titer of the antibody in the response against the internal proteins, matrix protein and nucleoprotein, is enhanced upon transfer of matrix protein- or nucleoprotein-specific, but not hemagglutinin- or neuraminidase-specific, TH clones. Thus, there is a hierarchy of help: B cells recognizing viral surface components, hemagglutinin or neuraminidase, can receive help from TH clones specific for any of the major structural viral proteins. In contrast, B cells responding to internal viral components, matrix protein or nucleoprotein, are restricted to receiving help almost exclusively from TH clones with the same protein specificity. These observations suggest that, upon B-cell surface immunoglobulin-antigen interaction and uptake of intact virus, B cells specific for viral surface proteins process and present all major structural viral antigens, enabling the B cells to interact with TH clones specific for any virion protein. B cells recognizing internal viral components, which may be accessible to interaction with B-cell immunoglobulin receptors mainly as free proteins, would present only the protein for which they are specific and, thereby, receive help only from the TH clones of the same protein specificity.\r"

HLA class I molecules and CD1a heavy chains share the ability to associate with several different cell-surface molecules. We show here, by several technical approaches, that HLA class I molecules are associated with CD1a heavy chains on the surface of normal thymus cells. The functional significance of this association during T-cell differentiation is discussed.\r"

We report here that an interleukin 3-dependent precursor B-cell line, LyD9, differentiated in vitro into mature B cells, producing IgM and IgG by coculture with bone marrow accessory (or stroma) cells or with dendritic cells and T cells. Up to 50% of IgM-positive cells, but no Thy-1-positive cells, appeared after the 7- to 10-day coculture. Induced LyD9 cells underwent heterogenous immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and synthesized mRNAs encoding immunoglobulin mu, gamma, and kappa chains. However, these cells did not show any rearrangement of genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of the T-cell receptor. The induction of differentiation by coculture with bone marrow stroma cells was blocked by anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 or anti-interleukin 4 antibody. These systems are useful for molecular biological studies on regulation of differentiation of bone marrow-derived cells into the B-cell lineage.\r"

Sequence data indicate that the repetitive elements (e.g., Alu) are associated with transcripts with no apparent long open reading frame. In contrast, a large increase of such heterodisperse RNAs is not seen in T lymphocytes activated by phytohemagglutinin or in a variety of leukemic cell lines. Examination of several cellular messages showed that the levels of some of their \"fully processed\" transcripts are reduced late after infection of HUT 78 cells, indicating that the levels of some mRNAs may decrease. Surprisingly, similar heterodisperse transcripts are also seen in great abundance in normal fresh thymocytes. It is possible that in HIV-infected T lymphocytes, the accumulation of high levels of such aberrant RNAs may directly or indirectly contribute to the death of HIV-infected T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of serotonin (5-HT), a well-known immunomodulator and neurotransmitter, on the ionic permeability of a pre-B lymphocyte cell line was investigated with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We found that physiological doses of this biogenic amine regulate a voltage-gated potassium channel by activating different subsets of receptors. More specifically, 5-HT induces in the recorded cells (i) increase in the maximum potassium conductance, which is due to activation of 5-HT1-like receptors, and (ii) acceleration of the inactivation process that is under the control of 5-HT3 receptors and, accordingly, is mimicked by the 5-HT3 agonist, 2-methyl-5-HT; involvement of those two distinct categories of receptors was demonstrated by using specific antagonists that block predominantly one or the other of these two actions. These two results show that hormones can affect lymphocyte physiology through modulation of their ionic conductances in a way that might help explain some of the diverse effects of 5-HT on neuronal cells.\r"

This model was tested by probing the structure of the red and green pigment loci with long-range physical mapping techniques. The loci were found to constitute a gene array with an approximately 39-kilobase repeat length. The position of the red pigment gene at the 5' edge of the array explains its lack of variation in copy number. Restriction maps of the array in four individuals who differ in gene number are consistent with a head-to-tail configuration of the genes. These results provide physical evidence in support of the model and help to explain the high incidence of color blindness in the human population.\r"

Thirty-one subjects bled from varices within 10 days of the spider evaluation, and this group was compared to 61 individuals who never bled. Our results show that incidence of spiders (90%) and varices (91%) is nearly identical, that frequency of variceal bleeding is higher among subjects with spiders compared with those who lack these lesions (36% vs 11%, p less than 0.05), and that the spider profile may be useful to identify individuals who are at increased risk for variceal hemorrhage. Frequency of bleeding was 50% (p less than 0.01) when greater than 20 spiders were present and 63% (p less than 0.01) when multiple atypically located lesions were detected. Large spiders (greater than 15 mm) correlate best with large varices and have the strongest association with bleeding (80%, p = 0.0002). If evidence of benefit from prophylactic treatment of esophageal varices can be established, then elements of the spider profile may serve as a discriminating marker to assist in selection of appropriate patients for therapy.\r"

The protein was purified from plasma (Cohn fraction IV-1) by precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The resulting product behaves almost indentically to the A1PI in plasma, showing that the process is gentle and nondenaturing. In order to lower the risk of transmission of disease, the product has been heat-treated. Although this resulted in some aggregation of protein, no new antigenic sites were created. Biologic, immunologic, and physiologic studies have shown that the protein behaves normally.\r"

Using both unlabeled and 125I-labeled A1PI (highly purified), plasma residence time and tissue distribution were determined in rabbits. A catabolic half-life of 48.5 hours was obtained for the labeled material, which agreed well with the antigenic decay (35.5 hours), measured with a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the functional activity decay (38.1 hours), measured antigenically by the ability of resident human A1PI to complex with human neutrophil elastase. No unusual tissue distribution was observed at the first, 24th, or 168th hour of sacrifice. Cynomolgous monkeys received infusions of labeled A1PI and a catabolic half-life of 55.45 hours was obtained; infusion of unlabeled material yielded anticipated plasma recovery and a significant increment in A1PI in bronchial-alveolar lavage fluid, both antigenically and functionally determined. Safety studies assessing acute physiologic response and both acute and subacute toxicity presented no significant adverse effects. We conclude that A1PI (human) presents normal pharmacodynamics and safety and is therefore associated with a wide margin of safety for the intended clinical applications.\r"

Administration of 20 mg/kg of A1PI and 150 microCi of 131iodine-A1PI to three dogs was accomplished without complications. Gamma camera scans documented a relatively homogenous distribution throughout the lungs. Bronchial lavage fluid that was recovered from the lungs of the dogs six hours after administration contained large amounts of human A1PI and showed a proportional elevation of anti-elastase activity. There was no evidence of acute toxicity.\r"

They also received a tracer dose (300 microCi) of 131I-labeled A1PI. No active or passive immunization against hepatitis was given. No acute toxicity was observed. Compared with baseline data, significant elevations of serum A1PI (measured both antigenically and as anti-elastase activity) occurred, with a serum half-life approximating 110 hours. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, obtained 48 hours after infusion, reflected a significant increase in A1PI concentration versus baseline bronchoalveolar lavage fluid values. Serial gamma camera images of the lungs confirmed persistence of enhanced lung radioactivity for several days. Urinary desmosine excretion did not change following A1PI infusion. During the period of follow-up thus far, no patient has had chronic toxicity, results of liver function tests have been stable, and there has been no development of hepatitis B antigen or antibodies to hepatitis B surface or core antigens.\r"

Subsequent examination of leukocytic enzymes and oxidants in experimental pulmonary inflammation in animals also demonstrated the generation of oxidants during development of acute pulmonary inflammation and indicated that the neutrophil is the cell mainly responsible for the release of oxidants.\r"

Astute recognition of alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficient panniculitis and assessment of response to these and other therapies will ultimately lead to a more complete understanding of the cause of this distinctive and uniquely associated disease.\r"

The authors studied the distribution of CMV in 4 patients with AIDS using a commercially available, biotin-labeled CMV DNA probe for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining for the detection of CMV antigen in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The sensitivity and specificity of the hybridization procedure was demonstrated by appropriate controls. The immunohistochemical test for the detection of CMV antigen in routine histologic sections was less sensitive than the in situ hybridization method. CMV DNA was detected not only in cytomegalic inclusion cells, but also in nuclei and cytoplasm of histologically normal-appearing cells such as endothelial cells, pneumocytes, hepatocytes, biliary epithelium, gastrointestinal epithelium, Langerhans islet cells, acinar and duct epithelium of pancreas, adrenal cortical and medullary cells, and prostate epithelium. In addition, CMV DNA, but not CMV antigen, was found in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These cells may serve as intermediate host or reservoir of CMV and may transmit posttransfusion CMV infection. In situ hybridization on routine histologic sections with a biotinylated CMV DNA probe is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for diagnostic and experimental pathology.\r"

Methodological problems were encountered in relation to sampling, interviewer allocation to areas, and access to routinely available information. Nevertheless, a consistent picture emerged from the studies that: demonstrated the impact of political violence on attendance at routine health service facilities (for hypertension, tuberculosis, immunizations, antenatal and postnatal services); highlighted the disruptions caused to basic services in high impact areas (water, street lighting, sanitation and transport); documented the problems experienced by nurses in performing their usual services and by patients obtaining access to their services; showed that high impact areas had three times higher rates of gunshot wounds than low impact areas during the period.\r"

The following results were obtained: 23 per cent of the men reported that they always used condoms for IAI and 21 per cent for RAI; 32 per cent sometimes used condoms for IAI; 28 per cent sometimes used condoms for RAI; 45 per cent never used condoms for IAI; and 50 per cent never used condoms for RAI. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the following variables were associated with both insertive and receptive condom use: condom acceptability; a history of multiple and/or anonymous partners in the past six months, and the number of partners with whom one is \"high\" (drugs/alcohol) during sex. Knowledge of positive HIV serostatus was more strongly associated with receptive than with insertive use. Condom use is a relatively complex health-related behavior, and condom promotion programs should not limit themselves to stressing the dangers of unprotected intercourse.\r"

DESIGN: Open-label longitudinal cohort study; blinded laboratory studies. SETTING: University-affiliated municipal hospital. Patients: Homosexually active men with negative assays for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antigen, and antibody to HBsAg; recruited in a sexually transmitted disease clinic or referred from community practitioners. INTERVENTIONS: Immunization with 20 micrograms of plasma-derived hepatitis B virus vaccine intramuscularly, repeated after 1 and 6 months; standardized evaluation at entry and at 1, 2, 6, and 7 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Low antibody response or nonresponse to vaccination occurred in 7 of 16 HIV-seropositive patients, compared with 6 of 68 HIV-seronegative patients (P = 0.002). Median levels of antibody to HBsAg 7 months after the first vaccine dose were 205.3 sample ratio units for HIV-seronegative patients and 15.5 sample ratio units for HIV-seropositive patients. By multivariate analysis, vaccine response was associated with HIV antibody status and not with cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocyte subset results, or impaired cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with HIV is associated with suboptimal antibody response to plasma-derived hepatitis B virus vaccine. Determination of antibody levels after vaccination in HIV-seropositive patients may be warranted.\r"

Motor and mixed afferent nerve conduction, F responses, H reflexes, and lumbar somatosensory evoked potentials were monitored, and morphological alterations were scored semiquantitatively at the end of the experiments. The role of macrophages and macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators in the effector phase of the disease was investigated by administering different inhibitors of macrophage metabolism, including silica, dexamethasone, and a variety of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase blockers. Silica and dexamethasone suppressed the clinical, electrophysiological, and morphological manifestations of the disease almost completely, indicating that macrophages are essential for the generation of inflammatory lesions. The inhibitors of arachidonic acid conversion failed to mitigate the severity of the disease. This is in contrast to observations in actively induced experimental autoimmune neuritis in which eicosanoid biosynthesis seems to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

Compared with patients receiving a lower dose of vasopressin infusion, these patients had a reduction in both postoperative mortality (21% vs 6%) and the proportion of patients requiring emergency operation (40% vs 18%). A decrease in operative blood loss (1340 vs 793 mL) was also seen. Adverse effects of vasopressin were increased by high-dose infusion, but no significant morbidity occurred. These results suggest that high-dose vasopressin infusion can reduce the mortality of acute variceal hemorrhage and porto-systemic shunting primarily by allowing patients to improve hepatic function prior to an elective operation and by decreasing intraoperative blood loss.\r"

A previously reported large C4A,21-OHA gene deletion associated in normal subjects with the HLA-A1;B8;DR3;C4AQ0 haplotype was detected by the appearance of a new C4 Hind III 8.5-kb fragment and disappearance of a 3.2-kb 21-OH Taq I fragment. In 3 SLE patients with homozygous C4A*Q0 and 15 with heterozygous C4A*Q0, this deletion pattern occurred almost exclusively in association with the HLA-B8;DR3;C4A*Q0 phenotype; the one exception was a black SLE patient. Other C4A*Q0-bearing HLA phenotypes in white patients and black patients with SLE, and the 2 completely C4-deficient SLE patients, had normal DNA hybridization to both C4 and 21-OH probes. The genetic basis for C4-null alleles in SLE is heterogeneous. A large C4A,21-OHA deletion occurs mainly on the HLA-B8;DR3;C4AQ0 haplotype in SLE and controls.

The resorptive action of IL-1 was not entirely dependent on prostaglandin mediation, since its effect was evident when prostaglandin synthesis was inhibited in the cultures by indomethacin. IL-1-induced resorption has been shown to be inhibited by 10(-5) M 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1-1-bisphosphonate (APD). This inhibition was partially reversed by increasing doses of IL-1. In vitro toxicity studies showed that at concentrations of 10(-4) M, APD inhibited the growth of cultured MM96, murine myelomonocytic P388D1, and rat osteosarcoma UMR 106 cells, but not other mast and lymphoid cell lines. These in vitro observations may have relevance to the use of APD in bone and joint diseases in which inflammation and bone resorption are prominent.\r"

Using a very sensitive bioassay based on the growth factor activity of this protein for B cell hybridomas, we found that IL-6 activity was significantly elevated in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory arthritides, as compared with that in a group of patients with osteoarthritis. Moreover, IL-6 was detected in about one-third of the serum samples from patients with RA. In the latter group, we found a significant correlation between serum IL-6 activity and serum levels of C-reactive protein, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen, and haptoglobin, which indicates that IL-6 is related to disease activity in patients with RA.\r"

To determine if the mouse nasopharynx is also susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of these viruses, animals were inoculated intranasally with suspensions of formaldehyde-inactivated herpes simplex viruses, type 1 or 2, or control material, four to five times a week. After exposure periods of 12, 20, and 32 weeks, groups of animals were killed randomly and the nasopharynx, along with the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs, were examined histologically. No preinvasive or invasive lesions were detected. These data suggest that the nasopharynx and cervix of the mouse differ in susceptibility to induction of carcinogenesis by inactivated herpes simplex viruses.\r"

Natural killer cell (NK) activity is very low or absent in all of these specimens. Culture of the cells with irradiated autologous tumor and expansion in recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) results in strong cytotoxicity for autologous tumor cells. The cultured cells are T-cells of mixed CD4 and CD8 phenotypes. Following restimulation with autologous tumor, these lines are capable of becoming specifically cytotoxic for autologous tumor as tested in direct killing and in cold target inhibition studies. The LNC yield from fresh specimens ranges from 1 X 10(7) to more than 1 X 10(9) cells averaging 5 X 10(8) cells. After the cells are cultured, we can achieve up to a 60-fold or more increase in cell numbers, that demonstrate strong cytotoxicity for melanomas. The potential for adoptive immunotherapy using such specifically sensitized cytotoxic T-cells of mixed phenotypes is discussed.\r"

Segments of canine femoral artery with endothelium (donor segment) were mounted in an organ bath and perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution; the effluent from the donor segment was used to superfuse a canine coronary artery ring without endothelium (bioassay tissue). Elevation of perfusate K+ concentration by 1.6-15 mM by intraluminal infusion of potassium chloride upstream of the donor segment evoked further contractions of bioassay rings contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. In contrast, the bioassay rings progressively relaxed when increasing concentrations of potassium chloride (10-40 mM) were added extraluminally to the organ bath where the perfused segment was mounted. Extraluminal application of phenylephrine or prostaglandin F2 alpha did not evoke relaxations in the bioassay ring. Removal of the endothelium from the donor segment or selective exposure of the segment (but not the bioassay ring) to Ca2+-deficient solution prevented the K+-induced relaxations. Treatment of the donor segment and the bioassay ring with inhibitors of known endogenous vasoactive substances (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, adenine nucleotides, and prostanoids) had no significant effect on the relaxation of the bioassay ring evoked by extraluminal application of potassium chloride. Simultaneous measurements of changes in isometric force in the donor segment and bioassay ring revealed that extraluminal elevation of K+ concentration relaxed the segments as well and that the relaxations could not be prevented by simultaneous intraluminal infusion of potassium chloride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By univarite analysis, ST segment elevation in both the anterior and inferior electrocardiographic leads was the most important factor influencing survival, followed by use of calcium antagonists, left ventricular function, smoking, and alcohol intake. The variables that significantly correlated with survival without myocardial infarction were use of calcium antagonists, left ventricular function, extent and severity of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass surgery, and disease activity. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that intake of calcium antagonists, extent and severity of coronary artery disease, and ST segment elevation in both the anterior and inferior leads were significant independent predictors of survival without myocardial infarction. We conclude that long-term prognosis for patients with variant angina is relatively good and that use of calcium antagonists improves it.\r"

The myocardium was imaged dynamically by positron-emission tomography, starting at the time of intravenous bolus injection of H215O. The arterial input function was measured continuously with a beta-ray detector. A separate image after C15O inhalation was also obtained for correction of the H215O radioactivity in the blood. The absolute myocardial blood flow and the tissue fraction were calculated for 15 subjects with a kinetic technique under region-of-interest analysis. These results seem consistent with their coronary angiographic findings. The mean value of the measured absolute myocardial blood flows in normal subjects was 0.95 +/- 0.09 ml/min/g. This technique detected a diffuse decrease of myocardial blood flow in patients with triple-vessel disease.\r"

They were evaluated for roentgenographic findings, as well as for immunologic marker expression of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The patients presenting with extrapulmonary sarcoidosis could be divided in two groups: nine of 21 (43 percent) presented with a stage 1 or stage 2 chest x-ray film, while 12 of 21 (57 percent) had no chest x-ray film abnormalities (stage 0). In all three groups of sarcoidosis patients, a significant increase of CD3+ T lymphocytes in the BAL fluid was found as compared to the healthy volunteers. However, the percentages of T lymphocytes in BAL fluid of patients with extrapulmonary sarcoid lesions and a normal (stage 0) chest x-ray film was significantly lower as compared to patients with extrapulmonary sarcoidosis and an abnormal (stage 1, 2) chest x-ray film, while the latter patient group did not differ from the patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. This suggests that in patients with extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, a gradual progression of the T cell alveolitis may occur. Furthermore, these data indicate that a marked discrepancy between chest x-ray film abnormalities and the presence of an alveolitis as determined by immunologic marker analysis exists in more than 50 percent of the patients with extrapulmonary sarcoidosis.\r"

Calcitonin (1 X 10(-7) M), in contrast, had no significant effect on heart cell beating rate or cAMP content. CGRP-stimulated increases in heart cell cAMP content were rapid, transient, dose dependent, and potentiated by isobutyl-methylxanthine (1 X 10(-4) M). Half-maximal increases in heart cell cAMP content occurred at 1 X 10(-8) M CGRP. Heart cell adenylate cyclase responses to CGRP were desensitized in a rapid (i.e. within 5 min) and dose-dependent manner by prior exposure to CGRP. Complete and half-maximal desensitization of heart cells to CGRP occurred at 1 X 10(-8) and 3 X 10(-10) M CGRP, respectively. Desensitization of heart cells to CGRP did not modify the cAMP response of heart cells to beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation, and beta-adrenergic agonist desensitization of heart cells did not modify responses to CGRP. Heart cell cAMP responses to CGRP were additive to those of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and occurred in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade. These observations demonstrate that CGRP exerts specific and potent agonist actions in cardiac myocytes and that regulation of myocardial responses to CGRP may occur by mechanisms involving increases in cAMP and receptor desensitization.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that the mammalian ovary synthesizes epidermal growth factor (EGF), somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I (Sm-C), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) and that these growth factors may in part form a basis for intraovarian regulation of granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation. The studies described herein were initiated to determine to what extent EGF, Sm-C, and TGFb function to regulate DNA synthesis and granulosa cell proliferation during primary monolayer culture. EGF, but neither Sm-C nor TGFb, alone consistently stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner, [3H]thymidine incorporation by porcine granulosa cells under defined conditions (P less than 0.01). Sm-C (10 ng/ml) and TGFb (1 ng/ml) both enhanced EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation (56% and 300%, respectively; P less than 0.05). The levels of incorporation obtained with EGF plus TGFb were equal to or greater than those obtained using fetal bovine serum alone. When EGF, Sm-C, and TGFb were combined, [3H]thymidine incorporation was equivalent to that obtained with EGF plus 10% fetal bovine serum, heretofore the most potent stimulatory combination for [3H]thymidine incorporation. Thus, under defined conditions, EGF, Sm-C, and TGFb act synergistically to promote DNA synthesis in primary cultures of porcine granulosa cells. Although DNA synthesis is a requisite step for but is not an accurate measurement of cell proliferation per se, we investigated whether the observed effects of EGF, Sm-C, and TGFb on DNA synthesis were realized in terms of actual cell proliferation. This was accomplished using platelet-poor plasma-derived serum (PPPDS; 0.1-2.5%), which contains reduced levels of endogenous growth factors but not components needed for cell attachment. EGF (P less than 0.05), but neither Sm-C nor TGFb, alone consistently stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner, granulosa cell proliferation, an effect directly related to the PPPDS concentration. Sm-C consistently and significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced EGF-stimulated cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The facilitative effect of Sm-C was inversely related to the PPPDS concentration, ranging from a 76 +/- 15% increase at 0.1% PPPDS to a 14% increase at 1.0% PPPDS. TGFb exhibited a bifunctional effect on granulosa cell proliferation. At low levels of PPPDS (0.1% and 0.25%) and in the absence of Sm-C, TGFb enhanced EGF-stimulated cell division, an effect which, although small and variable (24 +/- 16%), was consistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The formation of a complex with a high molar absorption coefficient at 600 nm when malachite green is added to phosphomolybdate at low pH and the adaptation of a microspectrophotometer to quantify the color in 10 microliters solution have made it possible for a dose-response curve from 0.1-1.2 ng phosphorus to be developed. The method has been applied to the assay of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns 4-P), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2), and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells after stimulation with angiotensin II (AII), K+, and ACTH for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 60 sec.

The values (picomoles per 2 X 10(5) cell incubate; n = 4) were: PtdIns, 808 +/- 28; PtdIns 4-P, 263 +/- 20; PtdIns 4,5-P2, 112 +/- 10; and Ins 1,4,5-P3, 136 +/- 4 for AII stimulation, and PtdIns, 925 +/- 76, PtdIns 4-P, 308 +/- 11; PtdIns 4,5-P2 146 +/- 28; and Ins 1,4,5-P3, 149 +/- 5 for K+ stimulation. No increase above control levels could be found at any incubation time after ACTH stimulation. Thus, both AII and K+ stimulate a short-lived increase in the mass of several elements of the phosphatidylinositol pathway. The discrepancy between these mass determinations and isotope study suggests that only some, but not all, pools are labeled by currently available techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium and other divalent cations rapidly increase intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in bovine parathyroid cells and inhibit PTH release. In other secretory cells, agonist-dependent generation of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) through polyphosphoinositide turnover initiates the rise in [Ca2+]i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. To determine whether polyphosphoinositide breakdown is involved in mediating the response to Ca2+ and the divalent cations Ba2+, Mn2+, and Sr2+, we measured the production of inositol polyphosphates in parathyroid cells. Within 120 sec of increasing extracellular Ca2+ to 2.0 mM, InsP3, inositol bisphosphate (InsP2), and inositol monophosphate (InsP1) rose 95 +/- 37%, 87 +/- 17%, and 96 +/- 29%, respectively, vs. values in cells at 0.5 mM Ca2+ (n = 5). Raising extracellular Ca2+ from 0.5-3.0 mM produced even greater peak increments of 134 +/- 13%, 179 +/- 35%, and 313 +/- 65% in InsP3, InsP2, and InsP1, respectively, by 120 sec (n = 4). Similarly, within 10 sec of their addition, BaCl2 (2 mM), MnCl2 (2 mM), and SrCl2 (4 mM) stimulated the production of InsP3 56 +/- 2%, 152 +/- 31%, and 160 +/- 25%, respectively, vs. that in untreated cells at 0.5 mM Ca2+. At later time points, InsP2 and InsP1 were increased. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin at concentrations up to 500 nM had no effect on inositol phosphates, although it inhibited PTH release in a dose-dependent manner. Since high Ca2+ and other divalent cations depolarize parathyroid cells, we assessed the effect of high extracellular K+ on inositol polyphosphates. The addition of depolarizing concentrations of K+ (40 mM) did not change inositol phosphates. Thus, Ca2+ and other divalent cations increase the production of InsP3, InsP2, and InsP1 in parathyroid cells by a mechanism independent of increases in [Ca2+]i and of membrane depolarization. We conclude that parathyroid cells express membrane receptors or sensors for Ca2+ and other divalent cations linked to polyphosphoinositide turnover.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of pituitary and brain CRF receptors and corticotroph responses during stress were studied in rats subjected to prolonged immobilization. Plasma ACTH levels showed the characteristic biphasic changes, with a rapid 23-fold increase in 15 min, followed by a decrease to about twice the basal levels after 6-h immobilization. In contrast, plasma corticosterone levels were markedly elevated throughout the duration of the stress. Pituitary CRF receptor content, measured by binding of [125I]Tyr-ovine CRF to pituitary membrane-rich fractions, was unchanged after 2.5 h, but was reduced by 28 +/- 2.7% (+/- SE) and 47.6 +/- 1.1% after 18 and 48 h of immobilization, respectively. These results were confirmed by autoradiography in slide-mounted frozen pituitary sections. In contrast, no changes in CRF receptor content were observed in brain areas, including olfactory bulb, frontoparietal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and lateral septum. A concomitant decrease in immunoreactive (ir) CRF content in the median eminence of rats immobilized for 48 h is consistent with the hypothesis that increased release of CRF into the portal circulation occurs during chronic stress. Despite pituitary CRF receptor loss and reduced in vitro responses to CRF, the increases in plasma ACTH and corticosterone in vivo after ether exposure or CRF injection were greater and more prolonged in rats immobilized for 48 h than in nonimmobilized controls. The decrease in pituitary CRF receptors was accompanied by decreased CRF-stimulated cAMP and ACTH release in cultured pituitary cells from 48-h restrained rats. However, concomitant incubation of cells with CRF and vasopressin restored cAMP and ACTH responses to control levels, suggesting that the simultaneous release of both regulators from the hypothalamus determines the plasma ACTH level. These findings indicate that the decrease in plasma ACTH during the adaptation phase to stress is accompanied by decreases in pituitary CRF receptors. However, the enhanced pituitary response to a superimposed stress or CRF injection implies that the decrease in plasma ACTH levels during prolonged stress may be due to adaptive changes at the central level. These findings emphasize the importance of the integrated actions of CRF and other regulators in the control of the pituitary adrenal-axis during stress.\r"

To determine if these changes were related to an abnormality in insulin receptor mRNA expression or structure of the receptor gene, we quantitated receptor mRNA from db/db and ob/ob homozygous, heterozygous (db/x, ob/x) and unaffected [db(x/x), ob(x/x)] mice and also analyzed restriction fragment length patterns of genomic DNA. Northern blot analysis of insulin receptor mRNA in livers from each of the genotypes revealed two major species of 7.5 and 9.5 kilobases. In contrast to known decreased receptor number in various tissues of ob/ob and db/db mice, quantitation of liver insulin receptor mRNA revealed that both homozygous affected strains had 2-fold or more increased levels of both major mRNA species compared to unaffected control groups. (P less than 0.05). Restriction fragment length analysis revealed no major insertion or deletion mutations in either the db/db or ob/ob insulin receptor gene. From the number and size of the fragments generated by this analysis, the minimal size of the mouse insulin receptor gene was calculated to be 97 kilobases, and the minimal number of exons was 16. These data indicate that the insulin receptor gene in ob/ob and db/db mice exhibits no major structural abnormality. Decreases in insulin receptor binding and/or kinase activity in affected mice appear to be due to a defect at the posttranscriptional level and occur despite increased levels of receptor mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "We have tested the hypothesis that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) regulate the proliferation of osteoblast-like cells. Cells which migrated from central bone explants of fetal calf calvaria expressed markers characteristic of the osteoblast phenotype, including osteocalcin (bone Gla protein) secretion and increased cAMP production in response to treatment with PTH. Bone cells proliferated in response to bFGF in a dose- and time-dependent pattern (ED50 = 60 pg/ml media). bFGF increased both the rate of bone cell proliferation (1.7-fold above controls) and final cell density at confluence (3-fold above controls). Acidic FGF (aFGF) exerted comparable effects though with lesser potency (ED50 = 2 ng/ml). In addition to its mitogenic effect, bFGF increased the osteocalcin content of conditioned media, suggesting that bFGF also modulates the function of osteoblast-like cells. Although TGF beta did not stimulate bone cell proliferation, it potentiated the mitogenic effects of aFGF and bFGF. In the presence of bFGF (0.7 ng/ml) the response to TGF beta was dose-dependent (ED50 = 1.7 ng/ml), with maximal stimulation at 5 ng/ml. These results demonstrate that aFGF and bFGF are mitogenic for bone cells in vitro. Furthermore, TGF beta potentiates the effects of bFGF and aFGF on the proliferation of bone cells. Since these growth factors are present in bone tissue in vivo, these data support the proposal that FGF and TGF beta may participate in the regulation of bone formation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the pathophysiology of diabetic osteopenia, circulating levels and bone contents of bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGP) were measured in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats . Plasma calcium and total protein were significantly decreased (P less than .01) in the diabetic group, and the plasma level of BGP in diabetic rats was 19.6 +/- 2.8 (mean +/- SE) ng/ml, which is significantly lower than the value of 89.2 +/- 14.0 ng/ml in control rats (P less than .01). Bone contents of calcium and hydroxyproline per femur were significantly decreased in the diabetic group (P less than .01), and the ratios of bone calcium to hydroxyproline were not different. Bone BGP content per femur in the diabetic group was 669 +/- 58 micrograms, which was also significantly lower compared with 1241 +/- 126 micrograms in control rats (P less than .01). The decreased bone content of BGP is consistent with the hypothesis that BGP synthesis is impaired in insulin-deficient diabetes. Because a relationship between plasma levels of BGP and bone turnover has been established, the low plasma BGP value suggests there is a decrease in bone turnover in diabetic rats. Therefore, we postulate that the low bone turnover is one of the pathological features of diabetic osteopenia and is at least partly responsible for the occurrence of this complication in diabetes mellitus.\r"

Data presented in this article indicate that this association only occurs in heterozygous DR3/4 patients and not in DR1/4 patients. Because there is an interactive effect of both DR3/4 and DR1/4 in type I diabetes, the data indicate that the contribution of DR4 haplotypes varies depending on the haplotype borne on the homologous chromosome. In addition, the frequency of the B44-DR4 haplotype was shown to be decreased in DQw3 (TA10-) diabetic subjects who were DR3/4 compared with those who were DR1/4 or DR4/x (a pooled group of patients with different DR alleles). This finding suggests that the decrease in the B44-DR4 haplotype in type I diabetes is not solely dependent on its linkage disequilibrium with the DQw3 (TA10+) allele but suggests there is an additional effect exerted independently.\r"

We found that the effect of adenosine was greater in intact aortas than in endothelium-denuded preparations. Denuding caused a parallel shift of the dose-response curve of adenosine to the right by a factor of five in comparison with intact aorta. This finding indicates that the relaxing effect of adenosine is partially endothelium-dependent in rat aorta. The mechanism of action of adenosine on vascular smooth muscle was also investigated in receptor-mediated and voltage-dependent calcium influx experiments performed with the addition of phenylephrine and high potassium concentrations, respectively. Although adenosine significantly inhibited only the tonic phase of the contraction induced by phenylephrine (10(-5) M), it did so to both the fast and slow phases of the contraction produced by high potassium concentrations (75 mM) with no preferential difference. In comparison to verapamil, a calcium entry blocker, adenosine behaved in a manner similar to that of verapamil in counteracting the constriction induced by either phenylephrine or potassium. We conclude that the vasodilator effect of adenosine is partially endothelium-dependent and that the mechanism of this effect may involve the inhibition of calcium influx and the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

To investigate the possibility of specific intrauterine transfer and storage of vitamin D in fetal tissues, vitamin D-deficient female rats were given depot injections of 3H- or 14C-labeled vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) before mating and the 3H-labeled animals were killed at stages during the last third of gestation. Analysis of lipid extracts from whole fetuses revealed a linear increase in the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and D3 itself between days 14 and 19 of gestation. During this period the elimination half-time of 3H-labeled molecules in maternal plasma fell from 27.1 to 4.4 d, suggesting that a specific mechanism was transferring vitamin D molecules into the fetuses. The vitamin was stored predominantly as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, with the highest concentrations in fetal muscle. Immediately after birth, pups from 3H- and 14C-labeled mothers were exchanged and later killed after 1-3 wk of suckling. Analysis of total lipid extracts for 3H and 14C content determined the relative contributions of vitamin D supplied before birth via the placenta and after birth in the maternal milk. The vitamin D content of the rat milk was relatively high, between 1.0 and 3.5 micrograms/liter. Nevertheless, the supply of vitamin D in utero, rather than from milk, was the main determinant of vitamin D status in early neonatal life. This is the first indication in a mammal of a specific transfer mechanism that allows the fetus to accumulate vitamin D from the mother during the last third of gestation.\r"

Synthesis and secretion of alpha 1 PI has been recently demonstrated in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, including peripheral blood monocytes and tissue macrophages. In this study we show that alpha 1 PI gene expression in human monocytes and bronchoalveolar macrophages is affected by a novel mechanism, whereby elastase directly regulates the synthesis of its inhibitor. In nanomolar concentrations, neutrophil or pancreatic elastase mediates a dose- and time-dependent increase in steady state levels of alpha 1 PI mRNA and in the rate of synthesis of alpha 1 PI in human monocytes and bronchoalveolar macrophages. Antisera to neutrophil elastase or pretreatment of elastase with the serine proteinase inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate abrogates the effect of elastase on alpha 1 PI expression. Elastase also stimulates the synthesis of alpha 1 PI in monocytes from homozygous PiZZ alpha 1 PI-deficient individuals, but has no effect on the rate of secretion; hence, the enzyme mediates an effect on alpha 1 PI that increases the intracellular accumulation of inhibitor and exaggerates the intrinsic defect in secretion of alpha 1 PI that characterizes the homozygous PiZZ alpha 1 PI deficiency.\r"

One such approach involves cloning of T cells from sites of autoimmune pathology followed by identification of putative disease-related T cell oligoclonality at the level of the T cell receptor gene rearrangements. We have now tested the feasibility of this approach in an animal model of autoimmunity, murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Spinal cord-derived, self (murine) myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cell lines and sublines were analyzed at the level of their receptor beta chain rearrangements using Southern blots. We now report that the MBP-reactive T cell lines and sublines derived from the spinal cords of four of five SJL/J mice with EAE share a 14.5-kb rearranged T cell receptor beta 1 band on Southern blots. A spinal cord-derived T cell line that was reactive to purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD), several lymph node-derived ovalbumin- and PPD-reactive T cell lines, as well as one MBP-reactive spinal cord-derived T cell line did not share this 14.5-kb rearranged beta 1 band. These results suggest that analysis of the antigen receptors used by T cells cloned from sites of inflammation may be a useful initial approach for identifying pathogenetically relevant T cells in the study of certain human autoimmune diseases.\r"

C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, C3 conversion products, and factor B activation was studied in five pregnancies one week before delivery, during labour, and six weeks after delivery. C3, C4, and CRP concentrations were unchanged and there was no evidence of complement conversion, either immediately before or during labour, by the classical or alternative pathways.

In a multivariate analysis, the initial site of disease was found to be related to survival. Initial lesions on the skin of the lower extremities or in the lymph nodes were associated with longer survival (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively). Higher helper/suppressor T cell ratios were strongly associated with longer survival (p less than 0.0001). Age and serum IgG antibody levels to cytomegalovirus did not appear to correlate. These results suggest that there are different subgroups of patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, and that the initial site of disease, as well as immunologic parameters, may be useful in prognosis.\r"

The dose versus febrile response curves were generated by injecting crude or partially purified supernatants that contained IL1 into the tail veins of young and old mice. Old mice responded with less fever than young mice to both crude and partially purified supernatants, suggesting that one mechanism for the blunted fever response observed with aging may be an altered response to EP.\r"

To a lesser extent they also lyse non-infectious virus-pulsed Ia+ but not Ia- target cells. In contrast, syngeneic stimulators pulsed with non-infectious virus (exogenous Ag) induce effector T cells that specifically lyse both infected and non-infectious virus-pulsed Ia+ target cells. The cells present in this heterogeneous culture predominantly express the CD4 (L3T4) cell surface marker. Frequency analysis by limiting dilution of splenocytes derived directly from influenza-immune mice revealed a similar pattern of precursor induction: In vitro stimulation with infected splenocytes yielded primarily class I MHC-restricted CTL, whereas stimulation with non-infectious virus reciprocally induced primarily class II MHC-restricted CTL. Thus, the Ag form and consequently the intracellular route of viral Ag presentation profoundly influence the MHC restriction of CTL precursors induced.\r"

H1.2F3 immunoprecipitates a cell surface-expressed disulfide-linked dimer that has a m.w. of 85,000 under non-reducing conditions and consists of subunits of 35,000 to 39,000 m.w. This dimer is distinct from the CD3-associated TCR-gamma delta complex (CD3/TCR), inasmuch as H1.2F3 does not co-precipitate or co-modulate with the CD3/TCR complex and recognizes an Ag with a single-peptide backbone of 22,000 m.w. after N-Glycanase treatment. H1.2F3 is weakly reactive with a small percentage of cells from unfractionated thymus, spleen, or lymph node, but reactivity with both T and B lymphocytes is markedly enhanced by a brief period of stimulation with Con A or PMA in vitro. This enhancement requires de novo protein synthesis. Enhanced expression of the H1.2F3 Ag can also be induced in vivo by injection of Con A or anti-CD3. H1.2F3 is a potent stimulator of T, but not B, cell proliferation in the presence of PMA and FcR-bearing accessory cells. These functional and biochemical studies strongly suggest that the Ag recognized by H1.2F3 is the murine homologue of the human CD28 Ag recognized by mAb 9.3.\r"

In this study we use synthetic peptides with amino-terminal leader sequences containing residues that differ with respect to their conformational stabilizing effects, charge, and hydrophilicity to examine the mechanism by which they modulate T cell recognition. Our findings indicate that the role of these residues in T cell stimulation is not related to their ability to stabilize alpha-helical secondary structure, nor do they appear to be processed differently. The leader sequences do not differentially influence the ability of the peptides to be presented by APC displaying Ia molecules of related haplotype, i.e., E alpha kE beta k, E alpha kE beta b, and E alpha kE beta s, to T cells which recognize the pigeon cytochrome c determinant on such presenting cells. Because antigenic potency correlates with the inclusion of hydrophobic residues and positively charged residues in the leader sequences, we discuss our findings with reference to the possibility that they non-specifically enhance the interaction of the antigenic peptides with the APC membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the CD4 and CD8 molecules in T cell activation is presently a matter of controversy. Although their role as associative binding elements to MHC class II or class I is well documented, their influence on the triggering process in unclear. Because antibodies to CD4 or CD8 block T cell activation in the absence of their respective ligands, a negative signaling by these molecules has been suggested. However, recent experimental evidence argues against a negative regulatory effect of these molecules, since, e.g., simultaneous cross-linking of TCR and CD4 leads to enhanced T cell activation. Therefore, a current model suggests that the association of TCR and CD4 in the membrane gives a positive signal essential for triggering. In this report we present evidence that this model is likely to be too simple. Anti-CD4 and CD8 antibodies inhibit alternative, nonreceptor pathways of T cell triggering via Tp103 and Tp44 in the absence of class II positive accessory or target cells. These antibodies also inhibit bypass activation of T cells by phorbol ester and calcium ionophore in an accessory cell-free system. Furthermore, if the CD4 or CD8 molecules are removed from the cell surface by antibody-induced modulation, the proliferative and cytotoxic response of T cell clones is enhanced. This enhancement is also observed if resting peripheral blood T cells are used as responder cells. These data show that the CD4 or CD8 molecules have a complex regulatory function in T cell activation beyond the requirement for co-cross-linking with the TCR.\r"

By using mitogenic lectins, cluster of differentiation (CD)2 and CD3 mAb, as stimuli, we studied early changes of the intracellular pH in the activation process of resting human PBL. We found increases in free cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and DNA synthesis but no intracellular alkalinization in the early activation phase upon stimulation with the mitogenic lectins, Con A, and PHA. Similarly stimulation with CD3 mAb led in most instances to no detectable pH shifts. Only in 7 out of 30 experiments was CD3 mAb-induced alkalinization observed. In contrast, stimulation with mitogenic combinations of anti-CD2 mAb led in all instances to rapid and clear-cut intracellular pH shifts very similar to those observed upon stimulation with PMA. In medium lacking sodium bicarbonate the intracellular alkalinization via the CD2 structure could be blocked by the amiloride analogue 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride (MIA), which indicates that this increase in pH is mediated by the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiporter. Blockade of this antiporter had no negative effect, however, on T cell proliferation as measured by thymidine incorporation. In contrast, significantly enhanced proliferation rates were observed after stimulation with mitogenic combinations of anti-CD2 antibodies in the presence of MIA. No such effect of MIA could be observed in lectin induced T cell stimulation. These findings indicate that stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter via the CD2 structure is neither a prerequisite for T cell proliferation nor does it promote T cell growth. It rather seems to function in a regulatory role. In its absence, superinduction of proliferation can be achieved.\r"

These results, combined with one-dimensional IEF analysis of the M1/B7 cells and the B7 subtypes, indicated that the differential recognition by the CTL clones of the transfected gene was not caused by aberrant expression of the gene itself or due to the absence of critical accessory molecules on the M1 fibroblast cells.

The study was performed by using primary mixed culture of lymphocytes from MHC recombinant siblings identical for MHC class II Ag (DR, DP, DQ) and displaying MHC class I disparity. The results indicate that such allogeneic combination is sufficient to trigger early activation steps within responder T cells without promoting a significant proliferation. After MHC class I allosensitization, a significant proportion of cells entered the cell cycle (G0----G1). The stimulatory potential of MHC class I Ag was further stressed by the specific induction on responder cells of IL-2R (22% T cell activation Ag positive). Under the same experimental conditions, transferrin receptor expression and IL-2 activity were not detectable. This is consistent with the low T cell proliferation. Exogenous rIL-1 did not improve IL-2 production and the subsequent T cell proliferation indicating that these two events were not associated with a defective accessory cell function involving IL-1 release. MHC class I disparity can also prime precursor CTL to differentiate into IL-2-dependent functional MHC restricted cytotoxic T cells. Conversely IFN-gamma had no effect. Addition to the culture of W6/32, a mAb specifically directed against a monomorphic determinant on human class I HLA-A, -B, and -C Ag was able to block all these activation events. These data clearly indicate a role of HLA class I Ag involvement in the early events triggering allogeneic T cell activation.\r"

Our previous experiments showed that T cells treated with neuraminidase (Nase) responded to an allogeneic Ia on B cells. In our experiments, the relationship between the responsiveness to the allogeneic Ia molecules on B cells and Nase activity of T cells was examined. The results showed that T cells increased in Nase activity with the acquisition of the reactivity to Ia on B cells. T cells from normal mice increased in Nase activity after the incubation for 3 days or more in MLR, and these T cells responded to allogeneic Ia on B cells. However, T cells from mice genetically deficient in Nase responded poorly to the Ia on allogeneic B cells even after the incubation in MLR for 3 days. T cells incubated for 3 days in MLR decreased in electrophoretic mobility, indicating the decrease of net negative charge of the cells, and increased in their binding of peanut agglutinin which has been reported to bind to galactosyl residues exposed on T cell surface by removing sialic acids. These results suggest that Nase in T cells was activated by the cultivation in MLR for 3 days, and sialic acids of some molecules on T cell surface were removed by the enzyme and, in turn, T cells acquired the responsiveness to allogeneic B cells in a secondary MLR. Thus, Nase was suggested to play a regulatory role in the recognition of Ia molecules in T cells.\r"

In other strains such as A/J or B10.BR, no cross-reactivity is exhibited; these strains are termed non-cross-reactive (NCR). Genetic experiments indicated that the cross-reactivity is dominant and that it is mapped to the I-A or I-E region of the MHC, with cross-reactivity exhibited by the I-Ab haplotype but not by I-Ak or I-Ek. Cell reconstitution experiments have indicated that the non-cross-reactivity is associated with the inability of the NCR APC to present Ag. Analysis of the area(s) on peptide 8 which serve(s) as epitope revealed that both strains recognize an overlapping area consisting of 11 amino acid residues in the middle of peptide 8 (residues 97-107), which by itself is nonstimulatory to TMVP- or peptide 8-immune T cells of the CR or the NCR strains. However, the addition of a few amino acid residues of the sequence of peptide 8 to this area converts it to a complete stimulatory epitope. Additivity experiments revealed that the CR strain contains two major T cell populations each recognizing this middle region of peptide 8 when elongated by a few amino acids N-terminally and C-terminally, respectively. In contrast, the NCR strain contains one major T cell population recognizing elongation only N-terminally. Because TMVP (but not peptide 8) requires processing before presentation to T cells, it is postulated that, during processing of TMVP, there occur alterations in the area of the proximal three or four N-terminal amino acids of the region consisting of peptide 8, destroying the only region containing the T cell epitope recognized by the NCR strain, hence TMVP and peptide 8 do not exhibit cross-reactivity in this strain. The same alterations of TMVP still leave intact an epitope consisting of amino acid residues C-terminal to the altered area which is recognized by the CR strain, hence the cross-reactivity exhibited by this strain. The results suggest that the difference in cross-reactivity on the T cell level between TMVP and peptide 8 exhibited by the strains may be due to differences in the orientation of presentation and the subsequent cell recognition of an epitope contained within peptide 8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There was a direct dose-response relationship between the proportion of cells having increased cytoplasmic free calcium concentration (Cai) after addition of second antibody and the amount of cell-bound Fab' DA4.4. In contrast, no rise in Cai was observed after cross-linking bound Yz-1 or HB5. To determine whether CR1 or CR2 could modify the increase in Cai induced by cross-linking membrane IgM, Cai was monitored after addition of second antibody to cells bearing combinations of either Yz-1 or HB5 with a limited amount of DA4.4. The combination of Yz-1 with DA4.4 yielded little or no further increase in the percentage of cells responding to cross-linking with elevated Cai compared with DA4.4 alone. However, the combination of HB5 with limited DA4.4 synergistically enhanced this response, resulting in stimulation that was equivalent to that obtained with optimal concentrations of DA4.4. The synergistic effect of CR2 was also observed with avidin as the cross-linking reagent for bound biotinylated HB5 and DA4.4, occurred in the presence of EGTA, and did not require T cells. Studies of the proliferation of B cell-enriched PBMC demonstrated that, whereas HB5 coupled to Sepharose alone induced little or no DNA synthesis, the combination of HB5 with limited DA4.4 on Sepharose induced a dose-related synergistic increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine.\r"

In the present report we have studied the depletion of CD4+ cells by a single dose of GK1.5 on the immune response to myelin basic protein and in the development of EAE. Our studies show that depletion of CD4 cells in mice that had received encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells altered the kinetics of acute and relapsing EAE, but did not prevent disease altogether. The in vitro T cell proliferative response to myelin basic protein in lymph node cells was maintained in the presence of significant depletion of CD4+ cells. These studies indicate that the population of Ag-reactive cells to be large and relatively refractory to antibody therapy. The implication of these results to therapy of human autoimmune disease is discussed.\r"

We have identified a region of approximately 30 amino acids reacting with more than 90% (16 of 17) of all human anti-p68 sera tested, regions which carry only a few and a region with no autoepitopes. Comparative analysis of epitopes recognized on partially degraded fusion proteins indicated that the anti-p68 autoimmune response is polyclonal. It involves generation of antibodies to several epitopes including one in a region with retroviral gag protein homology speculated to play a role in the initiation of the autoimmune response. Each of the 17 sera tested contained a different set of autoantibody specificities. These data are not consistent with random mutation as a sole mechanism of anti-p68 autoantibody induction and argue for an Ag-driven autoimmune response.\r"

The possibility of a significant contribution to cell surface staining by cytophilic, secreted Ig isotypes was eliminated by either the addition of anti-Fc gamma or anti-Fc epsilon R mAb during the culture or by acid treatment before staining. A similar proportion of IgE-expressing B cells are also found, after stimulation with LPS and 10(4) U/ml IL-4, by cytoplasmic staining using fluorescence microscopy. Cell sorting analysis further indicates that B cell populations that express mIgG1 and mIgE secrete these respective Ig isotypes. In addition, such cells show striking diminution in IgM secretion compared to mIgG1- or mIgE- sorted B cells. Stimulation with LPS and IL-4 (10(4) U/ml) induces co-expression of mIgG1 and mIgE on LPS-stimulated B cells; up to 75% of mIgE+ B cells co-express mIgG1 and up to 19% of mIgG1+ B cells express mIgE. This striking co-expression of mIgG1 and mIgE is mirrored by the co-expression of mIgG1 with mIgG3 and mIgG2b by B cells stimulated with LPS and 200 U/ml IL-4. Cell sorting analysis demonstrates that the B cell population that co-expresses mIgG1 and mIgE secretes both IgG1 and IgE. However, \"two-color\" cytoplasmic staining fails to demonstrate any B cells that simultaneously secrete both IgG1 and IgE.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to determine some of the mechanisms involved in macrophage-mediated lysis of tumorigenic cells. A375 human melanoma cells (A375-R) resistant to lysis mediated by TNF and IL-1 were selected from the TNF- and IL-1-sensitive A375 parental melanoma cells subsequent to continuous (2 mo) exposure to rTNF. Peripheral blood monocytes isolated by centrifugal elutriation from healthy donors were incubated with rIFN-gamma and muramyl dipeptide, with a lipoprotein derived from Escherichia coli (CG-31362) or with LPS for 24 h. These activated monocytes lysed both the A375 (monokine-sensitive) and A375-R (monokine-resistant) melanoma cells. Activated tumoricidal macrophages fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde lysed only the TNF- and IL-1-sensitive A375 cells. These fixed monocytes contained both IL-1 and TNF activities as determined by D10 cell proliferation and L929 cytolysis assays, respectively. Nearly identical results were obtained with preparations of plasma membranes from activated human monocytes. Anti-IL-1 and/or anti-TNF sera neutralized the cytolysis of tumor cells mediated by free monokines, by fixed monocytes, or by plasma membrane preparations. In contrast, anti-TNF and/or anti-IL-1 sera did not inhibit tumor cell lysis by viable activated monocytes. We conclude that IL-1 and TNF molecules associated with the plasma membranes of activated monocytes mediate lysis of susceptible target cells. However, because activated monocytes lysed IL-1-and TNF-resistant target cells, molecules other than these monokines must also be involved in the antitumor activity of monocytes.\r"

The cytotoxic effect of TNF-alpha was abrogated by a specific, neutralizing, polyclonal antibody. IL-1 had no direct cytotoxic effect on these cell lines; however, IL-1 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha.

  ".U": "88258058\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence that stromal cells are responsive to changes in their external milieu and that this can affect their function. IL-1 has been identified as one mediator that can affect stromal cells by increasing their secretion of CSF. The monokine has also been reported to be a B cell differentiation factor. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of IL-1 on the pattern of hemopoietic cell differentiation by adding IL-1 alpha to myeloid long term bone marrow cultures (MBMC) at the time of their transfer to lymphoid bone marrow culture conditions. This usually results in the cessation of myelopoiesis and the induction of B lymphopoiesis. The addition of 50 U/ml of rIL-1 alpha, but not 10 U/ml, to MBMC at the time of their transfer to lymphoid conditions resulted in a complete inhibition of B cell differentiation and sustained myelopoiesis. To determine whether adherent layer cells contributed to this effect, conditioned medium (CM) was collected from adherent layers treated previously with the antibiotic mycophenolic acid. This depletes the hemopoietic cells from the cultures and retains a purified population of stromal cells. CM from mycophenolic acid- treated adherent layers exposed for 24 h to 50 U/ml of IL-1 was added at volume concentrations of 5, 10, and 25% to MBMC at the time of transfer to lymphoid bone marrow culture conditions and at each feeding thereafter. Expression of the B lineage associated 14.8 Ag and IgM was inhibited on a dose dependent basis, and myelopoiesis was sustained in cultures to which 25% CM had been added. Induction of B lymphopoiesis occurred in cultures to which adherent cell CM not exposed to IL-1 had been added. The CM from the IL-1-treated adherent cells contained CSF, because it promoted the growth of myeloid colonies from fresh marrow or MBMC cells and stimulated the granulocyte-macrophage-CSF sensitive FDC-P1 cell line to proliferate. IL-3 was not present in the CM, because stimulation of the IL-3 sensitive 32D cell line was not observed. The CM from the IL-1-treated adherent cells stimulated thymocytes to proliferate in the presence of PHA. This raised the possibility that the induced CSF may have required IL-1 to mediate their effects in the cultures. However, B lymphopoiesis was inhibited and myelopoiesis maintained upon addition of recombinant granulocyte-, macrophage-, and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF to cultures, indicating that IL-1 or other non-CSF molecules induced by it need not be present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The active site of this potent mediator, which also has immunoregulatory function resides in its C terminus. This report demonstrates that the C terminus of C3a (C3a-desArg) exposed by proteolytic cleavage from C3 represents a neoantigenic determinant. Two mAb specific for this epitope were obtained after immunization with the synthetic octapeptide (OP) Arg-Ala-Ser-His-Leu-Gly-Leu-Ala [C3a(69-76)] coupled to the carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). These anti-C3a(69-76) antibodies (H453 and H454) reacted in an ELISA system with C3a and KLH-OP but not with C3 or with KLH alone. Free OP efficiently blocked binding of the antibodies to C3a, whereas binding of another anti-C3a mAb (H13) remained unaffected. In immunoblotting analysis, the anti-C3a(69-76) mAb reacted with purified C3a but failed to react with the denatured, noncleaved C3. A novel quantitative C3a-ELISA was established with the anti-C3a(69-76) mAb. It had a sensitivity in the nanogram range (1 to 5 ng/ml). The C3a determination was not impaired by the presence of high concentrations of C3. Therefore, C3 removal was not required in contrast to the previously described C3a assays. This C3a ELISA might facilitate clinical C3a quantitation, e.g., in samples from patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. In these patients, C3a determination in the early phase of the disease is of diagnostic relevance and has prognostic value.\r"

  ".W": "Because a number of different cytokines have been reported to regulate the synthesis of human, murine, and rat acute phase proteins (APP), we studied the effect of cytokines on production of several major human APP in a single system, the human hepatoma cell line Hep 3B. Conditioned medium (CM) prepared from human blood monocytes activated with LPS in the presence of dexamethasone led to substantial induction of serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) synthesis whereas the defined cytokines IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, and medium from a human keratinocyte cell line (COLO-16), containing hepatocyte-stimulating factor activity, failed to induce these two major APP. Induction of SAA and CRP was accompanied by an increase in concentration of their specific mRNA. Size fractionation of CM from activated monocytes by fast protein liquid chromatography indicated that SAA- and CRP-inducing activity eluted as a single peak with a Mr of approximately 18 kDa. alpha 1-Antitrypsin, which also failed to respond to IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, was induced by both CM and medium from COLO-16 cells. The induction of AT by CM was accompanied by an increase in specific mRNA. Induction of ceruloplasmin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and decrease in the synthesis of albumin was achieved by both CM and IL-1 beta. Ceruloplasmin and albumin responded in a comparable fashion to both TNF alpha and medium from COLO-16 cells; the response of ACT to these cytokines was not evaluated. These results indicate that human SAA and CRP are induced in Hep 3B cells by products of activated monocytes but not by IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, or some hepatocyte-stimulating factor preparations and that a group of heterogeneous mechanisms are involved in the induction of the various human APP.\r"

Development of a selective RIA for independent detection of antibody binding to surface (exposed) and subsurface (buried) epitopes of the trypanosome variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecule permitted sensitive quantitation and kinetic characterization of immune responses to these epitopes. The infected B10.BR mice responded to both exposed and buried VSG epitopes of clone LouTat 1 trypanosomes, whereas a B cell response by C3H mice to exposed VSG epitopes was not detected by RIA analyses at any time. However, VSG-specific IgM and IgG responses were produced to buried VSG epitopes, demonstrating that LouTat 1 induced immunoregulation was specific only for the B cell responses to exposed VSG epitopes. Subsequently, comparisons of B10.BR and C3H B cell responses to a heterologous variant, LouTat 1.5, were made. The results revealed that both infected mouse strains produced VSG 1.5-specific antibody to exposed and buried epitopes with different kinetics and maximal sera concentrations, showing, therefore, that these responses are not coordinately regulated. In addition, it was clear that the observed immunosuppression to exposed LouTat 1 VSG epitopes in C3H mice could be regulated by the parasite since functional C3H B cell responses were mounted against exposed VSG epitopes of a closely related variant (LouTat 1.5) after infection.\r"

A series of 5'-deletion constructs transfected into the Jurkat T lymphoid line demonstrates that a region encompassing 370 bp 5' of the transcription start site is sufficient for inducible chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase expression. Further dissection of this region with internal deletion (linker-scanner) mutants revealed that portions of at least two discrete regions from -42 to -169 and -289 to -361 bp relative to the transcription start site are critical for inducible expression of the IL-2 gene. T cell-specific expression of wild-type and mutant IL-2 promoter constructs could be increased severalfold by the insertion of an upstream SV40 enhancer. With use of a battery of IL-2 promoter constructs, we could not identify subregions within IL-2 5'-flanking sequences which are crucial for cyclosporin A inhibition of the IL-2 gene or deletion of which resulted in loss of T cell-specific expression, suggesting that such functions may be mediated at pre-transcriptional levels.\r"

Freshly isolated Thy-1+ EC failed to lyse YAC-1 targets; however, this activity was observed after 9 d of culture with Con A and IL-2. While dendritic Thy-1+ EC, in vivo, do not express the T-cell markers, L3T4 and Lyt-2, short-term cultured cells displayed phenotypic heterogeneity with small but significant percentages of Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ cells appearing transiently. The phenotype of the effector cell(s), which mediates cytotoxic activity, was determined by utilizing flow cytometry to sort short-term cultured EC into positively and negatively stained populations. Cells which express L3T4, or which lack asialo GM1, did not lyse YAC-1 targets; maximum cytotoxic activity was found within populations of cells which are asialo GM1+, Lyt-2-, and asialo GM1+, Lyt-2+. These studies indicate that Thy-1+ cells derived from mouse epidermis when cultured in the presence of Con A and IL-2 have the capacity to generate a phenotypically heterogeneous population, some cells of which are capable of mediating cytotoxic activities.\r"

In some other instances, such as injuries involving the neck and laryngopharyngeal organs, the tongue may be removed, but examined in only a cursory manner, since the serious pathology which caused or contributed to death is most often located in adjacent structures. While the postmortem examination was being carried out on a victim of ligature strangulation who exhibited relatively sparse external and laryngeal findings of significance, a unique and apparently heretofore undescribed patterned hemorrhage was discovered within the deep musculature of the tongue, having an appearance and contour identical to that of the curved edge of the subjacent hyoid bone. In difficult cases where strangulation is suspected as well as other potentially medicolegal problems with trauma involving the neck organs, a detailed inspection of the tongue through an easily accomplished dissection technique may provide invaluable information as to the mechanism of injury.\r"

Thirty mice (C-57 black strain) were injected with 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) MPTP.HCl for seven days. Five adult cats were injected with 10 mg/kg IP MPTP.HCl for seven days. Animals were killed five to seven days after the last MPTP injection. Reactive gliosis was observed throughout the mouse striatum but not in the substantia nigra. In contrast, reactive gliosis was topographically represented in the cat caudate nucleus with a dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral gradient evident. Gliosis was also observed in the putamen and the substantia nigra, pars compacta. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry revealed a loss of dopamine in the mouse striatum but no loss of substantia nigra neurons. Nigral neurons were destroyed in the cat.

Increased relative blood flow indicated the focus of partial seizures, its spreading to adjacent cortical regions and to distant brain structures via neuronal pathways. Ictal patterns of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were in agreement with clinical symptomatology. Successive SPECT studies were performed after 3-7 days in the absence of electroencephalographic and clinical signs of seizures but still revealed increased relative blood flow in the focus of the seizures. SPECT studies, performed 2-6 weeks after the last clinically observable seizures, demonstrated the transition from increased to decreased relative blood flow in the focus of the seizures. In one patient, the EEG was complementary to and corresponded with the rCBF patterns in the ictal state. However, the dynamics of interictal changes could only be assessed by brain SPECT.\r"

Multiple regression analysis of patient variables on initial factor scores (cross-sectional analysis) showed that; hospital dialysis and length of time on dialysis were predictive of more psychological distress; males were less compliant than females; patients on peritoneal dialysis made a poorer adjustment to their illness; and, hospital dialysis was predictive of more social distress. As long term predictors (prospective analysis): initial level of psychological distress predicted long-term level of psychological, social distress and illness adjustment; and initial level of compliance predicted long-term level of compliance.\r"

Males constituted 57% in the Boston group, 58% in Toronto. Pulmonary function test results were recorded for 64% of the Boston patients and 77% of the Toronto patients. Survival curves for the period 1972-1981 generated by the CF Patient Registry were compared. Patients in Boston tended to be shorter than patients in Toronto. This pattern was seen in both sexes in the 10-20 year age groups. Toronto males also weighed more than Boston males. Mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was not different in Boston and Toronto CF patients whether expressed as a percent of predicted or in litres by age groups. Median age of survival in Boston was 21 years, in Toronto 30, the two curves showing a marked separation from age 10. Although progressive pulmonary disease is the major cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis, the differences in growth and survival in these two patient groups, with very similar age-specific pulmonary function, suggest further examination of nutritional guidance and intervention in CF, especially regarding the traditional restriction of dietary fat.\r"

A massive, prolonged, and irreversible release of DA occurred after 15 min 10 mM MPP+, showing a biphasic trend: the rapid amphetamine-like increase was followed by a slower and larger DA efflux, reaching its maximum after 25 min. One minute perfusions with 1-100 mM MPP+ caused a gradual increase in the overflow of striatal lactate, reaching a maximum effect after 20-30 min. The similarity between the time courses of the MPP+-induced efflux of DA and lactate suggests that both effects are probably consequences of inhibition of aerobic glycolysis by MPP+. A comparison with the courses of DA and lactate efflux after death of control rats showed a delay of several minutes before the toxic effects of MPP+ become apparent. These in vivo data are consistent with the hypothesis that MPP+ accumulates and then kills dopaminergic cells, possibly by the irreversible inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.\r"

  ".W": "The racemic mixture of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which has been reported to produce selective destruction of serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system, was studied to determine its neuroendocrine and temperature effects and mechanism of action. MDMA elevated serum concentrations of corticosterone in doses ranging from 3 to 20 mg/kg administered i.p. Serum corticosterone concentrations were elevated 30 min after the administration of MDMA (10 mg/kg i.p.) and remained elevated 4 hr later. Serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations were elevated by administration of MDMA in doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg i.p., and were maximal 60 min after the injection of 10 mg/kg i.p., declining rapidly over the next 4 hr. MDMA also significantly elevated the body temperature of rats maintained at ambient (23 degrees C) temperature. MDMA-induced corticosterone secretion and hyperthermia were blocked by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonists, ketanserin and mianserin, which have a high affinity for 5-HT2 binding sites. Conversely, neither (-)-pindolol, a beta antagonist that also blocks 5-HT1A-mediated responses, nor the nonspecific 5-HT antagonists, cyproheptadine and metergoline, had an effect on MDMA-induced corticosterone secretion. None of the 5-HT antagonists blocked MDMA-induced PRL secretion. Pretreatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) 16 hr before MDMA administration significantly blunted the effect of MDMA on corticosterone but not PRL secretion. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (150 mg/kg i.p.) for 3 days depleted cortical and hypothalamic 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid by approximately 80% and significantly attenuated MDMA-induced corticosterone and PRL secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have studied the effect of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, on MK 422 (active parent diacid of enalapril)-induced hypotension and potentiated inflammatory skin responses in ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs. Clonidine was found to abolish dose-dependently MK 422-potentiated ovalbumin-evoked inflammatory dermal responses and it possesses additive hypotensive effects when combined with the ACE inhibitor. It would therefore be interesting to evaluate further alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists and ACE inhibitors in a combination therapy in humans when single drug antihypertensive therapy of the drugs is insufficient.\r"

While the efficacy of coronary artery bypass surgery has been addressed in several large-scale, randomized trials, there is little information about how appropriately the procedure is actually being used in the community. We determined the appropriateness of coronary artery bypass surgeries performed in three randomly chosen hospitals in a western state. We determined appropriateness by comparing data obtained from a detailed medical record review with a list of 488 indications. This list, developed by a national panel of physicians, covered all possible reasons for performing the procedure. Three hundred eighty-six cases from the years 1979, 1980, and 1982 were examined. Fifty-six percent of the surgeries were performed for appropriate reasons, 30% for equivocal reasons, and 14% for inappropriate reasons. The percentage of appropriate surgeries varied by hospital, from 37% to 78%, but did not vary by patient age. Eliminating the performance of inappropriate procedures may lead to reductions in health care expenditures or to improved patient outcomes.\r"

Such damage is not seen upon administration of two additional monoclonal antibodies that recognize this epithelial cell antigen, but with different epitope specificities. To further clarify the mechanism of the epithelial cell abnormality, in vitro studies were performed on glomerular epithelial cells established in primary culture. None of these antibodies alone appeared to induce alterations in the cultured cells. However, an antibody of the IgG2a isotype induced complement-dependent cell damage in vitro, although failed to be pathogenic when administered in the intact animal. The pathogenic potential of K9/9 cannot be attributed to its isotype or rates of association or dissociation from the antigen. Studies suggest that all three monoclonal antibodies recognize different, though spatially close epitopes on SGP-115/107. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a complement- and leukocyte-independent mechanism of tissue injury that results from an epitope-specific interaction between a monoclonal antibody and its specific, epithelial cell surface-antigen. Results obtained in other cell systems suggest that abnormalities of epithelial cell structure and function can result from the interaction between specific cell surface components, particularly growth factor receptors, and monoclonal antibodies that mimic the actions of the specific agonist.\r"

The pediatric literature generally recommends a prolonged trial of antibiotics and closed tube thoracostomy drainage. We report a favorable experience with a selective approach to open drainage in 22 children, many of whom had an empyema already organizing at admission. Open drainage was considered in children whose conditions failed to improve after 3 to 5 days of therapy with antibiotics and closed drainage. The method of drainage was selected according to the pathologic phase of the empyema: five children with fibrinopurulent empyema were successfully managed by limited decortication, and 17 with organizing empyema received decortication. Clinical improvement was usually dramatic; most of the children became afebrile by postoperative day 3 and were discharged by postoperative day 10. There were no deaths. Three children (14%) had complications of postoperative air leak or infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae (5) and Hemophilus influenzae (3) were the most common single pathogens. The presence of anaerobic bacteria in 8 of 22 children (36%) was associated with rapid organization of the empyema and the need for decortication. Decortication procedures have a low risk and are effective in children with empyema. They should be considered as definitive therapy, rather than as a last resort.\r"

To determine the efficacy of autotransfusion using the cardiotomy reservoir used during operation as a postoperative collection system, we studied the characteristics of reservoir blood (minimum 500 ml, mean 810 ml) and compared the hematologic profiles of 21 patients before and after blood infusion. The mean hematocrit value of the shed blood was 25% +/- 7%, platelet count 60,000 +/- 39,000/microliter, fibrinogen 19 +/- 25 mg/dl, and factor VIII 11% +/- 7%. The fibrinopeptide A concentration was 400 ng/ml, and the B beta 15-42 peptide was 28 +/- 14 pmol/ml. These values indicate defibrination of the blood before collection (no clots were found in the reservoirs), and no significant differences were detected between the types of reservoirs used (Bentley, n = 10, Shiley, n = 11). Infusion of reservoir blood between 500 and 1860 ml did not significantly affect the factor VIII, fibrinopeptide A, or B beta 15-42 peptide levels. Fibrinogen levels increased from 254 to 395 mg/dl (p less than 0.001). Only six of 21 patients received bank blood before discharge. These findings indicate that extensive coagulation occurs within the mediastinum before the blood is collected, that mediastinal blood can be safely infused without inducing fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation, and that use of the cardiotomy reservoir is a safe and inexpensive method of autotransfusion after coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

Twenty-four adult mongrel dogs underwent bypass of the circumflex coronary artery with one of the above grafts. Three months postoperatively, graft patency was assessed by angiogram, and postmortem specimens were studied by intraluminal injection of a dilute barium solution proximal to the graft. Proximal, mid, and distal segments of each graft were examined microscopically. In situ internal mammary artery grafts and free internal mammary artery grafts were not significantly different in regard to patency, vascular wall cellular structure, or perfusion of the vasa vasorum. The stripped, free internal mammary artery group had a higher incidence of thrombosis, intimal thickening, and medial injury than the pedicled (in situ and free internal mammary artery) grafts. This difference may be due to early vascular wall ischemia as a result of poor early perfusion of the vasa vasorum. The stripped, free superficial femoral artery grafts were all patent, but all had adventitial injury.\r"

No relationship between blood fibrinogen level and bonding power was demonstrated. Comparing AFTA with Fibrin Sealant, the commercial fibrin tissue adhesive, shearing strength between two glued pieces of human dura with AFTA was less 10 minutes and greater 30 minutes after gluing. Gluing a TORP (Richards) to a 1-cm2 piece of human dura yielded generally somewhat greater bonding power when using Fibrin Sealant. Autologous Fibrin Tissue Adhesive provides bonding power adequate for middle-ear surgery, eliminates transmission of viral diseases and, unlike Fibrin Sealant, AFTA is available in the United States.\r"

In contrast to earlier studies, the results of this study indicate that maximal exertion effects a decrease in the percentage, but no change in the absolute number of peripheral blood B-cells (Pre: 0.21 +/- 0.01; Post: 0.31 +/- 0.02 cells x 10(-6).ml-1).

  ".W": "In B cells the loci encoding immunoglobulin chains usually show allelic exclusion; a given B cell transcribes and translates only one productively rearranged allele of the heavy and light chain loci. This ensures that each B cell expresses only one antigen receptor. The loci encoding T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha- and beta-genes may behave similarly. We have previously reported that the expression of a transgenic TCR beta-chain prevents functional and nonfunctional V beta rearrangements in the endogenous beta-chain loci but not D beta J beta rearrangements. We have also been unable to detect the expression of the TCR gamma-chain locus in thymocytes of these mice (unpublished observations). To study the mechanisms involved in forming a mature T-cell repertoire further, we have constructed mice expressing alpha- and beta-TCR transgenes derived from a cytotoxic T-cell clone that is specific for the male antigen H-Y in the context of H-2Db MHC molecules. Here we show that in these mice rearrangement of endogenous alpha-chain loci is also suppressed, although to a lesser extent than rearrangement of beta-chain loci. In addition, in male alpha beta TCR transgenic mice we observed T-cell clones which had deleted both transgenic alpha- and beta-chain genes and expressed endogenous alpha- and beta-chain TCR genes. These cells are presumably derived from rare thymocytes that leave the male thymus because their TCR no longer recognizes self antigen. The vast majority of CD4+8+ nonmature thymocytes expressing alpha- and beta-transgenes are deleted in the male thymus.\r"

  ".W": "CD4, a cell-surface glycoprotein expressed on a subset of T-cells and macrophages, serves as the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (reviewed in ref. 1), binding to the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120 with high affinity. Attempts to block infection in vivo by raising antibodies against gp120 have failed, probably because these antibodies have insufficient neutralizing activity. In addition, because of the extensive polymorphism of gp120 in different isolates of HIV, antibodies raised against one HIV isolate are only weakly effective against others. Because interaction with CD4 is essential for infectivity by all isolates of HIV, an agent that could mimic CD4 in its ability to bind to gp120, such as a peptide or monoclonal antibody, might block infection by a wide spectrum of isolates. To aid the identification of such a ligand we have defined regions of CD4 that are required for binding to gp120. Although human CD4 is similar to mouse CD4 in amino-acid sequence (55% identity, ref. 6) and structure, we have found that the murine protein fails to bind detectably to gp120 and have exploited this finding to study binding of gp120 to mouse-human chimaeric CD4 molecules. These studies show that amino-acid residues within the amino-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of human CD4 are involved in binding to gp120 as well as to many anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to infectable host cells, such as B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and colorectal cells, is mediated by a high-affinity interaction between the gp120 component of the viral envelope glycoprotein and the CD4 receptor. Upon binding, it is thought that the second component of the envelope, gp41, mediates fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes. However, the early steps of HIV infection have not yet been thoroughly elucidated. Viral entry was first reported to be mediated by pH-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis; subsequent studies have shown entry to be pH-independent. Although direct fusion of virus to plasma membranes of infected cells has been observed by electron microscopy, it is still formally possible that the infectious path of the virus involves receptor-mediated endocytosis. To gain a better understanding of receptor function in viral entry, we have analysed the ability of several altered or truncated forms of CD4 to serve as effective viral receptors. Our results indicate that domains beyond the HIV-binding region of CD4 are not required for viral infection. Some of the altered forms of CD4 that serve as effective HIV receptors are severely impaired in their ability to be endocytosed. These experiments therefore support the notion that viral fusion to the plasma membrane is sufficient for infection.\r"

The immunologic responses to anti-T12, anti-T4, and anti-T11 MAb infusions were assessed in subjects with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis as part of phase I clinical studies. It was found that in vivo anti-T-cell MAb infusions specifically suppress in vitro measurements of the human immune response: anti-T11 MAb decreased T-cell activation by phytohemagglutinin, and anti-T4 MAb infusions abolished pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulin synthesis without lysis of the CD4 + T-cell subpopulations. With repeated infusions of the anti-T11 MAb, anti-mouse antibodies were found in the circulation. Although most of the human anti-mouse antibody was not isotype-specific, significant anti-idiotypic activity was observed after repeated infusions in two of three subjects. The human anti-mouse antibodies were almost exclusively of the IgG isotype. The magnitude of the human anti-mouse response was significantly less after administration of either anti-T11 or anti-T4 as compared with anti-T12 MAbs. Murine anti-T-cell MAb can provide a specific, benign form of acute immunosuppression in humans. Repeated administration of these reagents in more chronic diseases can result in anti-idiotypic antibodies that block binding of the anti-T-cell MAbs to the T-cell surface. While the clinical usefulness of currently used murine MAbs in chronic diseases is restricted by the development of human anti-mouse antibodies, newer, more immunosuppressive MAbs may eliminate this problem.\r"

Clinical studies to date have shown that infusion of murine MAbs, the preparations presently available, is associated with the production of antimurine antibody, which makes the long-term use of this therapy infeasible in most patients. This is a considerable drawback in a chronic progressive disease such as MS, where retreatment options are an important consideration in choice of therapy. In addition, most murine MAbs are not lytic for targeted cells. The target antigens often undergo modulation and the cells reappear in the circulation with full function in spite of ongoing therapy. The use of MAbs in MS needs further clarification through randomized, controlled clinical trials.\r"

Polyclonal antibodies were used to isolate a large number of cDNA clones from an expression library derived from cytolytic-T-cell mRNA. Three distinct full-length cDNA clones coding for granzymes D, E, and F were identified by restriction site mapping and nucleotide sequencing. The three deduced amino acid sequences are highly similar to one another (between 72% and 90% amino acid identities) and to the sequences of granzymes B and C, cathepsin G, and rat mast-cell proteases I and II (between 43% and 57% amino acid identities). Cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bonds are conserved, as are the catalytic-site residues characteristic of serine proteases. Comparison of the cDNA-derived protein sequences with the amino termini of the isolated granzymes provides evidence that they are stored in a fully processed, activated form after removal of the signal peptide and two additional residues (propeptide) at the amino terminus. Immunoelectron microscopic studies demonstrated that granzymes D, E, and F are present in the same morphologically distinct cytoplasmic granules in which perforin has been found previously.\r"

HRF was first described as a 65-kDa membrane protein of human erythrocytes capable of inhibiting the formation of transmembrane channels by the membrane attack complex of complement. It has also been isolated from activated human lymphocytes and shown to confer upon these cells relative resistance to lysis by the membrane attack complex and by the complement component C9-related protein of human cytotoxic lymphocytes. The soluble HRF of lymphocyte granules inhibits reactive lysis of erythrocytes by the membrane attack complex of human complement. It was also found to be a potent inhibitor of (i) the cytolytic activity of the C9-related protein of human cytotoxic lymphocytes, (ii) human large granular lymphocyte cytotoxicity, and (iii) the cytotoxic activity of human CD8+ lymphocytes obtained by cell sorting from recombinant interleukin 2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It is proposed that granule-derived soluble HRF and cell surface-membrane-bound HRF are involved in the mechanism of self-protection of killer lymphocytes.\r"

The 1633-base-pair clone contains an open reading frame (ORF) 357 nucleotides long, capable of encoding a 13,282-dalton polypeptide. The Sm-D coding region is initiated at an AUG codon downstream from a sequence with excellent match to the consensus for the eukaryotic ribosome-binding site. The Sm-D ORF is preceded by a 150-nucleotide-long untranslated leader and followed by a 1126-nucleotide-long untranslated region containing four putative poly(A) signals. The predicted amino acid sequence reveals a (Gly-Arg)9 repeated motif at the C terminus, which may constitute one of the Sm-D immunoreactive determinants. Moreover, this C terminus shows interesting features: (i) a good homology to protamines as expected for a nucleic acid binding protein and (ii) a striking similarity to a region in the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen.\r"

Studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis indicated that the time of synthesis of the activator of the IL-2 gene in Jurkat T cells corresponds to the time of appearance of NFAT-1. NFAT-1, or a very similar protein, bound functional sequences of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1; the LTR of this virus is known to be stimulated during early T cell activation. The binding site for this complex activated a linked promoter after transfection into antigen receptor-activated T cells but not other cell types.

When Lewis X Brown Norway F1 hybrid (LBN) small-bowel grafts were transplanted into Lewis (LEW) rats without CSA, all grafts in the proximal 10 cm, the proximal 40 cm, and the entire (approximately 80 cm) small bowel were rejected on days (mean +/- SEM) 6.6 +/- 0.2 (n = 11), 7.0 +/- 0.4 (n = 6), and 7.8 +/- 0.7 (n = 6), respectively. A 10-day course (days 0-9) of CSA 2 mg/kg significantly (p less than 0.05) prolonged the survival of the proximal 10 cm, the proximal 40 cm, and the entire small bowel allografts to days 18.8 +/- 1.7 (n = 5), 16.5 +2- 1.3 (n = 6), and 13.5 +/- 1.0 (n = 4), respectively. Similarly, the CSA 5 mg/kg regimen significantly (p less than 0.05) delayed the rejection of the 10 cm, the 40 cm, and the 80 cm small-bowel grafts to days 50.2 +/- 7.2 (n = 6), 47.7 +/- 2.6 (n = 3), and 40.3 +/- 5.8 (n = 3), respectively. However, 6 of 12 rats treated with CSA 5 mg/kg died of pneumonia, and these animals were all in groups with the 40 cm and 80 cm grafts. When these animals were included in calculations of rejection-free survival, the averages for the 40 and 80 cm groups treated with CSA 5 mg/kg were 34.2 +/- 6.4 and 28.7 +/- 6.1 days, respectively. CSA suppressed rejection of small-bowel allografts in a dose-related fashion. More important, significantly (p less than 0.05) lower doses of CSA were necessary for rats that received shorter intestinal grafts. In fact, the relationship between rejection and CSA dose in the 10 cm grafts was characterized by the formula: day of rejection = 9.3 [CSA dose]1.03. We conclude that the ideal small intestinal graft should be the smallest possible segment that maintains adequate nutrition and CSA doses should be matched for segment lengths.\r"

Treatment by an under-running suture achieved primary control of bleeding in all patients, and during a median follow-up of 7 months (range, 1 to 36), two early and one late episodes of rebleeding occurred. As all patients had varices in the anal canal with only occasional extension into the rectum, the term \"anorectal varices\" is to be preferred.\r"

  ".W": "Moyamoya disease was diagnosed as the cause of cerebral infarction in eight young adults (seven women, one man), aged 17-40 (mean 33) years. All had angiographic abnormalities characteristic of moyamoya disease. Single-photon emission tomography showed bilateral carotid circulation hypoperfusion and posterior circulation hyperemia in all seven patients with regional cerebral blood flow studies. All seven women had used oral contraceptives before cerebral infarction. Four patients were treated medically; one died of a second cerebral infarction 9 months after diagnosis. Four patients underwent superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis; they did well. Moyamoya disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of cerebral infarction as well as intracranial hemorrhage in young adults, particularly women. A possible relation between moyamoya disease and oral contraceptive use deserves investigation.\r"
