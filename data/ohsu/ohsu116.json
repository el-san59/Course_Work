In addition to SV40 T antigen, these components included the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, topoisomerase I, and a fraction that contained a single-stranded DNA binding protein. The latter protein, which sediments at 5.1 S on glycerol gradients and copurifies with two major protein species of 72 and 76 kDa, was isolated solely by its ability to support SV40 DNA replication. The purified system retained the species-specific DNA polymerase alpha-primase requirement previously observed with crude fractions; the complex from HeLa cells supported SV40 replication, whereas that from calf thymus and mouse cells did not. DNA containing the polyomavirus origin of replication was replicated in a system containing polyomavirus T antigen, the HeLa single-stranded DNA binding protein-containing fraction, and DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex from mouse, but not HeLa, cells. While crude fractions yielded closed circular duplex DNA, none was detected with the purified system. Nevertheless, the addition of a crude fraction to the purified system yielded closed circular monomer products.\r"

The protein, purified about 100,000-fold from plasma, is rich in hydrophobic amino acids, especially leucine. It has a molecular weight of 74,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.2. The protein's transfer rate for cholesteryl ester between each of the major plasma lipoprotein classes is similar, and rapid compared to the transfer of triacyglycerol, regardless of the overall lipid composition of the donor and acceptor lipoprotein. These data suggest that this protein functions primarily in the transfer of cholesteryl esters between plasma lipoproteins.\r"

  ".W": "Two major polypeptide species, 31,000 Mr (p31) and 31,500 Mr (p31.5), are associated with the 3' poly(A) tails of Dictyostelium mRNAs. We have measured the accumulation of newly synthesized p31 and p31.5 and the decay of preexisting p31 and p31.5 during heat shock and early development. Only trace amounts of newly synthesized p31 and p31.5 accumulate at elevated temperatures, indicating that these polypeptides are not heat shock proteins. In addition, preexisting p31 and p31.5 are rapidly degraded in heat-shocked cells. This degradation is selective and occurs simultaneously with a sharp drop in the rate of translational initiation. Similarly, in early development, a time when the rate of translational initiation is also sharply reduced, only trace amounts of newly synthesized p31 and p31.5 accumulate and most of the preexisting p31 and p31.5 is rapidly degraded. When translational elongation is inhibited with cycloheximide, preexisting p31 and p31.5 remain stable. Therefore, a correlation seems to exist between the abundance and stability of these poly(A)-associated proteins and the rate of translational initiation. Our results are consistent with the proposed role of the poly(A)-protein complex in translation and do not support the findings of Schonfelder et al. [Schonfelder, M., Horsch, A. & Schmid, H.-P. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6884-6888] that the 73,000 Mr HeLa cell poly(A)-binding protein and the major 73,000 Mr mammalian heat shock protein (i.e., hsp70) are identical.\r"

  ".W": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, EC 4.1.3.5) is a negatively regulated enzyme in the synthetic pathway for cholesterol, isopentenyl tRNA, and other isoprenoids. The 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA for Chinese hamster hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase contains an optional exon of 59 nucleotides located 10 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site. About 50% of the mRNAs contain this exon, and the other 50% lack it owing to differential intron splicing. We show that the two transcripts are found in similar ratios in multiple tissues of the Syrian hamster, including the brain. The relative amounts of the two transcripts in brain and liver are constant from day 0 to day 75 of life. A similar alternative splicing pattern for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase was observed in three human tissues: cultured fibroblasts, fetal adrenal gland, and fetal liver. A cDNA for human synthase had 90% homology to the hamster sequence in the region corresponding to the optional exon. This sequence contains a 20 out of 26 nucleotide match with the sequence immediately upstream of the initiator AUG codon in the mRNA for hamster hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the enzyme that follows the synthase in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. These findings raise the possibility that the optional exon plays an important, conserved functional role in humans and hamsters.\r"

Fibronectin is shown to be increased in human dermal connective tissue by immunofluorescence, mainly at the dermoepidermal and capillary basement membranes. The rate of fibronectin biosynthesis, excretion, and incorporation in a pericellular polymeric form was investigated using genetically diabetic KK mouse skin and fibroblasts as compared to Swiss and C57BL mouse skin and fibroblasts. The rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into proteins recovered in the culture medium or in deoxycholate and NaDodSO4 or urea extracts was investigated. The rate of incorporation in the medium and deoxycholate extracts was comparable. However, the relative rate of incorporation of the tracer in the NaDodSO4-extractable, pericellular polymeric form was increased in the diabetic KK fibroblasts both for total proteins and for fibronectin. In pulse-chase experiments, the deoxycholate-soluble and NaDodSO4-soluble fractions exhibited a precursor-product relationship. The rate of passage of fibronectin from the deoxycholate-soluble (cellular compartment) form to the NaDodSO4-soluble (pericellular polymeric) form was strongly accelerated in the diabetic fibroblast cultures. These results confirm the increased rate of synthesis of fibronectin in diabetic fibroblasts as well as its processing from the cellular compartment to the polymeric pericellular form. The increase of fibronectin in diabetic connective tissues, in the matrix as well as in the basement membranes, may play a role in the mechanism of micro- and macroangiopathies and in the perturbed permeability characteristics of the diabetic capillaries, and as a glycoprotein it may contribute to the increased periodic acid/Schiff reagent staining of diabetic capillary basement membranes.\r"

The 32P-labeled material isolated by HPLC was alkali labile and the hydrolyzate ran as nucleotides on paper chromatography.

During degranulation, the membrane capacitance increased in steps, as single secretory vesicles fused with the cell membrane. The average step size was 10 times larger in beige than in normal mice, in agreement with the different granule sizes measured microscopically in the two preparations. Following individual capacitance steps in beige mice, individual granules of the appropriate size were observed to swell rapidly. Capacitance steps are frequently followed by the stepwise loss of a fluorescent dye loaded into the vesicles. Stepwise capacitance increases were occasionally intermittent before they became permanent, indicating the existence of an early, reversible, and incomplete state of vesicle fusion. During such \"capacitance flicker,\" loss of fluorescent dye from vesicles did not occur, suggesting that the earliest aqueous connection between vesicle interior and cell exterior is a narrow channel. Our results support the view that the reversible formation of such a channel, which we term the fusion pore, is an early step in exocytosis.\r"

We studied the patterns of pH and Ca2+ changes after exposure of murine fibroblasts to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), bombesin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Intracellular pH and Ca2+ were measured by using the fluorescent dyes 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and fura-2. Three distinct patterns of intracellular pH change were observed. PDGF and bombesin caused a rapid (maximum change, less than 2 min) cytoplasmic acidification of 0.03 pH unit followed by a slower (5-10 min) alkalinization of approximately 0.11 pH unit above the resting pH of 6.88. PMA caused alkalinization without causing the early acidification. Bradykinin caused rapid acidification without the slower net alkalinization. Ionomycin also caused acidification without subsequent alkalinization. All acidification responses were amiloride resistant. Patterns of intracellular Ca2+ response were also determined for each agent. PDGF and bombesin caused a transient increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ from a resting level of 85 +/- 12 nM to 190 +/- 12 nM within 2 min and return to baseline within 5 min. PMA caused no change in intracellular Ca2+. Bradykinin caused the most rapid (maximum response, less than 20 sec) increase in intracellular Ca2+. For each agonist, the Ca2+ transient could be blocked by buffering intracellular Ca2+ with quin-2. In Ca2+-buffered cells, PDGF, bombesin, bradykinin, and ionomycin failed to induce cellular acidification, but alkalinization responses to PDGF, bombesin, and PMA persisted. We propose that the transient acidification seen with PDGF, bombesin, and other agents is the result of increased intracellular Ca2+. However, growth factor-induced alkalinization via the Na+/H+ exchanger is independent of changes in Ca2+.\r"

The evidence indicates that the transfer of integral proteins into membranes very likely uses the same molecular machinery as does the translocation of hydrophilic proteins across membranes.

No differences were observed between cog/cog and +/+ DNA in Southern blots using TG cDNA probes corresponding to 88% of the coding sequences, suggesting that the cog mutation is not due to a large deletion of this portion of the gene. Neither was there any obvious qualitative or quantitative difference between mutant and normal TG mRNA as judged by blot hybridization of electrophoretically fractionated thyroid RNAs.

The V beta 5 and V beta 8 genes belong to the only two known three-member V beta subfamilies. We present studies on the linkage of these six genes and show that the genomic organization is that of alternating V beta 5 and V beta 8 genes. Our analysis suggests that these genes were tandemly duplicated, the unit of duplication being a pair of V beta 5 and V beta 8 genes. This tandem organization permits transcripts to initiate from the promoter of an unrearranged V beta located upstream of the rearranged V beta gene. These transcripts can generate functional beta-chain gene messages by novel RNA splicing of the upstream leader exon to the V beta coding exon of the downstream rearranged gene. We extend the analysis of the T-cell receptor genomic organization to include 12 V beta genes and suggest that all V beta genes are closely linked on chromosome 6. In addition, we discuss the possible implications of the close linkage of the V beta genes on the development of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene repertoire.\r"

The composite cDNA sequence showed a 347-amino acid protein preceded by an NH2-terminal leader peptide sequence. The translated sequence beginning at the DAF NH2 terminus encodes four contiguous approximately equal to 61-amino acid long repetitive units of internal homology. The repetitive regions contain four conserved cysteines, one proline, one glycine, one glycine/alanine, four leucines/isoleucines/valines, one serine, three tyrosines/phenylalanines, and one tryptophan and show striking homology to similar regions previously identified in factor B, C2, C4 binding protein, factor H, C1r, factor XIII, interleukin 2 receptor, and serum beta 2-glycoprotein I. The consensus repeats are attached to a 70-amino acid long segment rich in serine and threonine (potential O-glycosylation sites), which is in turn followed by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids. RNA blot analysis of HeLa and HL-60 RNA revealed three DAF mRNA species of 3.1, 2.7, and 2.0 kilobases. The results indicate that portions of the DAF gene may have evolved from a DNA element common to the above proteins, that DAF cDNA predicts a COOH-terminal anchoring polypeptide, and that distinct species of DAF message are elaborated in cells.\r"

The most likely recombination frequency between the loci is 4%, and the associated logarithm of the odds is 5.26. Haplotype analysis using flanking restriction fragment length polymorphism markers indicates that the locus for X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is distal to probe DXS42 but proximal to probe DXS99 (from Xq26-q27).

  ".W": "We have sequenced the virulent Asibi strain of yellow fever virus and compared this sequence to that of the 17D vaccine strain, which was derived from it. These two strains of viruses differ by more than 240 passages. We found that the two RNAs, 10,862 nucleotides long, differ at 68 nucleotide positions; these changes result in 32 amino acid differences. Overall, this corresponds to 0.63% nucleotide sequence divergence, and the changes are scattered throughout the genome. The overall divergence at the level of amino acid substitution is 0.94%, but these changes are not randomly distributed among the virus protein. The capsid protein is unchanged, while proteins NS1, NS3, and NS5 contain 0.5% amino acid substitutions, and proteins ns4a and ns4b average 0.8% substitutions. In contrast, proteins ns2a and ns2b have 3.0 and 2.3% amino acid divergence, respectively. The envelope protein also has a relatively high rate of amino acid change of 2.4% (a total of 12 amino acid substitutions). The large number of changes in ns2a and ns2b, which are largely conservative in nature, may result from lowered selective pressure against alteration in this region; among flaviviruses, these polypeptides are much less highly conserved than NS1, NS3, and NS5. However, many of the amino acid substitutions in the E protein are not conservative. It seems likely that at least some of the difference in virulence between the two strains of yellow fever virus results from changes in the envelope protein that affect virus binding to host receptors. Such differences in receptor binding could result in the reduced neurotropism and vicerotropism exhibited by the vaccine strain.\r"

We prepared a series of peptides representing the intercysteine \"loop\" sequence (residues 38-57) in human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and lutropin (hLH) beta subunits, anticipating that it might be oriented toward the surface and accessible to receptors. The peptides were characterized chemically and tested for bioactivity by binding to rat ovarian membrane receptor and stimulation of Leydig cell testosterone production. The hCG beta-(38-57) and hLH beta-(38-57) peptides inhibited binding of 125I-labeled hCG half-maximally at 1.51 X 10(-4) and 2.03 X 10(-5) M, respectively, while other peptide hormones and fragments from elsewhere in the beta subunit were inactive. Both peptides stimulated testosterone production, with half-maximal responses at 3.55 X 10(-5) M (hCG) and 2.18 X 10(-5) M (hLH). By radioimmunoassay with an antibody to thyroglobulin-conjugated hCG beta-(38-57) peptide, native hCG and beta subunit were highly reactive, as were the reduced and carboxymethylated subunit and peptide. Helical-wheel projection predicted an amphipathic region in the N-terminal portion of the 38-57 sequence, and circular dichroic measurements showed an increase in ordered structure, especially alpha-helix, when the 38-57 peptides were transferred from an aqueous to a more lipophilic (90% trifluoroethanol) environment. These results indicate that the 38-57 region of beta subunit is exposed on the surface and constitutes a component in the receptor-binding domain for hCG and hLH. A region of amphipathic-helical structure in the 38-57 sequence may promote hormone-receptor interactions in a manner proposed for several other peptide hormones.\r"

This inhibitory effect was unaffected by hexamethonium but was abolished by atropine and tetrodotoxin, suggesting that neuropeptide Y is acting via postganglionic cholinergic neurons. Studies utilizing alpha-adrenergic and dopamine receptor antagonists revealed that neuropeptide Y-mediated relaxation was blocked only by the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine. Neuropeptide Y also antagonized muscle response to electric field stimulation that was reversed by yohimbine. Additional studies with muscle slices incubated with [3H]norepinephrine or [3H]choline showed that neuropeptide Y stimulated norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, which, in turn, inhibited the release of acetylcholine via alpha 2 receptors located on postganglionic nerves. This pathway provides a mechanism for neuropeptide modulation of classical neurotransmitter function.\r"

Five other organic anions were comparably studied: phenol red, Evans blue, sulfobromophthalein, rose bengal, and indocyanine green. For compounds of intermediate hydrophobicity, including conjugated bilirubin, the dominant association was with a bile salt/organic anion hybrid particle of dimensions larger than that of a simple pure bile salt micelle. Vesicular association was found to be dominant only for the most hydrophobic organic anions, indocyanine green and rose bengal; conversely, the most hydrophilic anion, phenol red, showed no vesicular association. Accordingly, a strong positive correlation (P less than 0.001) was found between percent vesicular association and degree of hydrophobicity of the organic anion. Alkaline conditions (eluant pH 9) decreased or prevented vesicular hydrophobic interaction with all anions. We conclude that two important particulate mechanisms for transport in bile of conjugated bilirubin and other water-soluble anions are bile salt/organic anion hybrid particles and vesicles. For most organic anions of intermediate hydrophobicity, including conjugated bilirubin, the bile salt/organic anion hybrid particle is the dominant transport vehicle.\r"

A cDNA clone for human MPO was isolated by immunologic screening of human hematopoietic lambda gt11 expression vector libraries with specific anti-MPO antibody. The identity of the cDNA clone was confirmed by finding that epitope-selected antibody against this clone recognizes purified MPO and MPO in human promyelocytic (HL-60) cell lysates by immunoblot analysis, and that hybrid selection of HL-60 mRNA with this cDNA clone and translation in vitro results in the synthesis of an 80-kDa protein recognized by the anti-MPO antiserum. RNA blot analysis with this MPO cDNA clone detects hybridization to two polyadenylylated transcripts of approximately 3.6 and approximately 2.9 kilobases in HL-60 cells. No hybridization is detected to human placenta mRNA. Upon induction of HL-60 cells to differentiate by incubation for 4 days with dimethyl sulfoxide, a drastic decrease in the hybridization intensity of these two bands is seen. This is consistent with previous data suggesting a decrease in MPO synthesis upon such induction of these cells. The MPO cDNA should be useful for further molecular and genetic characterization of MPO and its expression and biosynthesis in normal and leukemic granulocytic differentiation.\r"

Although tissue-cultured sympathetic neurons synthesize several oligomeric forms of AcChoEase, only the hydrophobic globular (G4) form of AcChoEase is present within these clusters. This G4 form is asymmetrically distributed within neurons and is transported preferentially into nerve fibers following its synthesis in the cell bodies. Thus G4 is found in clusters on neurons and is readily distinguishable from the hydrophilic forms on the surfaces of myotubes. The association of a specialized form of AcChoEase in densities on neurons in culture indicates that neurons and myotubes have distinct mechanisms for localizing AcChoEase molecules on their surfaces and suggests that these two types of electrically excitable cells have different requirements for organizing synaptic components on their plasma membranes.\r"

Thus, we have isolated and determined the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide subunit of the amyloid fibrils of these NFT and describe their ultrastructure. The NFT, which consist of single and paired helical filaments, similar to those of Alzheimer disease, and occasionally triple helical filaments, are composed of multimeric aggregates of a polypeptide of 42 amino acids (A4 protein). The relative molecular mass of the subunit protein, 4.0-4.5 kDa, is the same as the molecular mass of the amyloid of NFT, of the amyloid plaque cores, and of vascular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome; the sequence of 15 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of the amyloid fibrils in the NFT of Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia is identical to that of the amyloid of NFT, amyloid plaque cores, and cerebrovascular deposits in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. Furthermore, the heterogeneity, or variation in polypeptide length, of the N-terminus of the amyloid of Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia is the same as in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. Our observations indicate that the brain amyloids of these diseases have a common subunit protein, which would also indicate a common pathogenesis.\r"

However, several atypical Sst I restriction fragment banding patterns occur only in or near the zone of sympatry.

It was demonstrated that esterase B1 of Culex quinquefasciatus and esterase A1 of Culex pipiens are overproduced in resistant strains by factors of at least 500-fold and 70-fold, respectively, as compared with the corresponding susceptible strains. These factors approximate the levels of resistance to the organophosphate chlorpyrifos determined by bioassay--i.e., about 800-fold and 100-fold, respectively. Antiesterase B1 antiserum was found to react with other type B esterases (B2 of C. quinquefasciatus and B3 of Culex tarsalis) but not with type A esterases (A1 of C. pipiens, A2 of C. quinquefasciatus, or A3 of C. tarsalis); similarly, antiesterase A1 antiserum was found to react with other type A esterases (A2 and A3) but not with type B esterases (B1, B2, and B3).

This activity appears crucially dependent on the geometry of their complexes with DNA. Therefore, structures of the complexes formed by the self-complementary tetranucleotide d(CpGpCpG) with Ditercalinium and with a related monomer were investigated in 0.1 M [2H]acetate buffer (pH 5.5) by using 400-MHz 1H NMR. In both cases, d(CpGpCpG) retained a right-handed duplex structure as shown by exchangeable-proton analysis and intramolecular nuclear Overhauser effect measurements. According to the large upfield shifts measured on the base protons (including the imino proton) and on the aromatic protons of the pyridocarbazole rings, the monomer appears to monointercalate and the dimer to bisintercalate into the tetranucleotide duplex. Ditercalinium dissociates from its complex about 100-1000 times slower than does the monomer. The negative intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects observed on protons corresponding to the convex edge of the pyridocarbazole rings when the sugar protons are saturated suggest that both ligands intercalate with their chain oriented to the wide groove side of the helix, a situation mimicking that encountered with repressors. Antitumor activity of 7H-pyridocarbazole derivatives is discussed in terms of geometry of the intercalated complexes.\r"

  ".W": "A product of the adenovirus gene E1A is responsible for the stimulation of transcription from six viral promoters as well as at least two cellular promoters. We have detected a HeLa cell factor, termed E2 promoter binding factor (E2F), that appears to mediate the transcriptional stimulation of the viral E2 promoter. Competition experiments revealed that E2F did not recognize and bind to the E1B, E3, E4, or major late promoter sequences. Furthermore, three additional promoters stimulated by E1A, heat shock protein 70, beta-globin, and early simian virus 40, do not bind E2F. In contrast, the factor does recognize sequences in the E1A enhancer, and within the E1A enhancer are duplicated binding sites for E2F. Finally, a single E2F binding site from the E1A enhancer can confer increased transcription to a mouse beta-globin promoter, dependent on the action of the E1A gene product. This stimulation requires binding of E2F since methylation of the binding site, which blocks binding in vitro, reduces transcription stimulation in vivo. We, therefore, conclude that E2F is likely to be responsible for the E1A-mediated stimulation of the E1A gene as well as the E2 gene but is not involved in the activation of the other E1A-inducible promoters.\r"

Med. 311, 629-634] have recently described a family in which hyperproinsulinemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, suggesting a structural abnormality in the proinsulin molecule as the basis for this disorder. However, unlike two previous kindreds with a similar syndrome, the serum proinsulin-like material in this family did not appear to be an intermediate conversion product but instead behaved like normal human proinsulin by several criteria. To further characterize this disorder we isolated and sequenced the insulin gene of the propositus. Leukocyte DNA was cloned into lambda-WES and recombinants containing the two insulin alleles, lambda MD41 and lambda MD51, were isolated by plaque hybridization. DNA sequencing of lambda MD51 showed that it contained the normal coding sequence for human preproinsulin. Sequence analysis of lambda MD41, however, revealed a single nucleotide substitution in the codon for residue 10 of proinsulin (CAC----GAC) that predicts the exchange of aspartic acid for histidine in the insulin B chain region. This mutation was also found in an insulin allele cloned from a second affected family member (propositus's father). These results, along with the linkage analysis of Elbein et al. [Elbein, S.C., Gruppuso, P., Schwartz, R., Skolnick, M. & Permutt, M.A. (1985) Diabetes 34, 821-824], strongly implicate this mutation as the cause of the hyperproinsulinemia in this family. Inhibition of the conversion of proinsulin to insulin may be related to altered folding and/or self-association properties of the [Asp10]proinsulin.\r"

To define the sequences required for regulation by cAMP, we inserted fragments from the 5' flanking region of the alpha-subunit gene into a test vector containing the simian virus 40 early promoter (devoid of its enhancer) linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Results from transient expression assays in BeWo cells indicated that a 1500-base-pair (bp) fragment conferred cAMP responsiveness on the CAT gene regardless of position or orientation of the insert relative to the viral promoter. A subfragment extending from position -169 to position -100 had the same effect on cAMP-induced expression. Furthermore, the entire stimulatory effect could be achieved with an 18-bp synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to a direct repeat between positions -146 and -111. In the absence of cAMP, the alpha-subunit 5' flanking sequence also enhanced transcription from the simian virus 40 early promoter. We localized this enhancer activity to the same -169/-100 fragment containing the cAMP response element. The 18-bp element alone, however, had no effect on basal expression. Thus, this short DNA sequence serves as a cAMP response element and also functions independently of other promoter-regulatory elements located in the 5' flanking sequence of the alpha-subunit gene.\r"

Retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide (1 microM) inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation by 55-75%, inhibited tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA by 63-80%, and induced 38-50% of the cells to differentiate into mature granulocytes. The potency of growth inhibition and induction of differentiation by retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide was similar to that of all-trans-retinoic acid. The continuous presence of either retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide or all-trans-retinoic acid was not required to obtain maximum growth arrest and differentiation: a 1-hr exposure of HL-60 cells to the retinoids gave the same response (measured after a total incubation time of 48 hr) as a 24-hr or 48-hr continuous treatment. Retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide (0.1-0.2 mM) was 50% less cytotoxic to HL-60 cells than all-trans-retinoic acid at an equimolar concentration. Retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide was not significantly metabolized to other retinoids; retinoic acid was not formed during incubation. We conclude that retinoyl beta-D-glucuronide can arrest HL-60 cell proliferation and induce their differentiation into mature granulocytes; it may act by itself or by being hydrolyzed to retinoic acid, which could be immediately utilized and metabolized. The therapeutic use of this retinoid as an antineoplastic agent is suggested.\r"

PDGF had no effect on the resting level of superoxide generation but inhibited both the rate and the extent of fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated superoxide production in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration required to inhibit the response by 50% was 95 +/- 26 pM (n = 10). PDGF also blocked activation by other receptor-mediated agonists such as the complement protein C5a and opsonized zymosan, but not by phorbol myristate acetate or arachidonate, both of which may act at postreceptor sites. The growth factor, however, had no effect on the binding of fMet-Leu-Phe to its receptor. PDGF in concentrations that blocked the oxidative burst stimulated phagocytosis of opsonized latex particles. Thus, PDGF functions as a heterologous \"down-regulator\" of receptor-mediated activation of the neutrophil oxidative burst and an activator of phagocytosis. A model for a feedback regulatory loop between platelets and neutrophils is proposed.\r"

Under torsional stress (at bacterial superhelical density), chloroacetaldehyde reacted at multiple discrete regions within the neighboring sequences of the (dG-dC)16 insert. When the plasmid population was considered as a whole, the distribution of the chemically reactive bases exhibited a pattern of inversion symmetry with the center of inversion in the middle of the (dG-dC)16 insert.

The possibility that the supercoiled plasmid DNA is in equilibrium with these two structural forms is discussed.\r"

Sequence analysis demonstrated that the clones consist of 4647 contiguous nucleotides and contain an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 1461 amino acids, which we estimate represents greater than 75% of the primary structure of the receptor. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the receptor has a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 163 amino acids that is rich in acidic residues, a 23-amino acid transmembrane segment, and an extracellular domain containing at least eight homologous repeats of approximately 145 amino acids. One of the repeats contains an additional 43-residue segment that is similar to the type II repeat of fibronectin. Each repeat contains a highly conserved 13-amino acid unit bordered by cysteine residues that may be functionally important.\r"

Assays measuring competition between angiogenin and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A for PRI reveal that binding of the inhibitor to angiogenin is extremely tight, with a Ki value well below 0.1 nM. The stability of the angiogenin-PRI complex was assessed by cation-exchange HPLC quantitation of free angiogenin. No significant dissociation was detected after 17 hr at 25 degrees C in the presence of a large excess of bovine ribonuclease, which serves as a scavenger for free inhibitor. The results of these experiments, based on the predictive capacity of the angiogenin/RNase homology, suggest that PRI and related inhibitors may participate in the in vivo regulation of angiogenin and that this might have pharmacologic and/or therapeutic implications.\r"

However, intestinal mucosal cells, like bacteria, face a varying milieu. Hence, we tested for adaptive regulation of intestinal nutrient transporters, sought its functional significance, and compared it with regulation of bacterial proteins. All 12 transporters studied proved to be regulated by dietary substrate levels. Regulation in the intestine is slower than in bacteria and shows lower peak-to-basal activity levels. Regulatory patterns vary greatly among transporters: two sugars and two nonessential amino acids monotonically up-regulate their transporters, two vitamins and three minerals monotonically down-regulate their transporters, and two transporters of essential amino acids respond nonmonotonically to levels of their substrates. These varied patterns arise from trade-offs among four factors: transporter costs, calories yielded by metabolizable substrates, fixed daily requirements of essential nutrients, and toxicity of certain nutrients in large amounts. Based on these trade-offs, we predict the form of regulatory pattern for intestinal transporters not yet studied.\r"

Studies upon which our hypothesis is based and confirmatory work in a variety of other cell lines and in vivo have utilized actinomycin D and cycloheximide to inhibit RNA and protein synthesis, respectively. These inhibitors, however, are not specific and have been reported also to interfere with other cellular processes. Diphtheria toxin is a specific protein synthesis inhibitor that acts only by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2, thus preventing peptide chain elongation. We thus tested whether diphtheria toxin could prevent catecholamine-induced desensitization in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. The toxin inhibited protein synthesis and altered the time course of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation as did the less-specific protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Cellular cAMP content after a 30-min exposure to isoproterenol was similar in control and in toxin-treated cells. However, after 4 hr of treatment with isoproterenol, toxin-treated cells accumulated up to six times more cAMP than controls. When cells or cell-free adenylate cyclase preparations were rechallenged with agonists, toxin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis prevented desensitization. These results show that diphtheria toxin, a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis, can interfere with the normal physiological regulation of cAMP metabolism in eukaryotic cells and provide compelling evidence that catecholamine stimulation of adenylate cyclase promotes the synthesis of a protein(s) that, in some way, inhibits hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase.\r"

All of the inhibitory activity in extracts of several tissues can be accounted for by their porphyrin and metalloporphyrin content.

One main GTP-binding protein (29.5 kDa) was detected in the membrane fraction, while three others (29, 27, and 21 kDa) were detected in the soluble fraction. Two cytosolic GTP-binding proteins (29 and 27 kDa) were degraded by trypsin; another cytosolic protein (21 kDa) and the membrane-bound protein (29.5 kDa) were resistant to the action of trypsin. Treatment of intact platelets with trypsin or thrombin, followed by lysis and fractionation, did not affect the binding of [alpha-32P]GTP to the membrane-bound protein.

Tracer diffusion was measured by injecting fluorescent tracers into cells and quantitating the rate of subsequent spread into adjacent cells. Cytoplasmic diffusion was determined by fluorescence photobleaching. These experiments show that gap junctional channels constitute approximately 70-80% of the total cell-to-cell resistance to the diffusion of organic tracers at high concentrations in this tissue. At low concentrations, however, the binding of tracer to cytoplasm slows down the cytoplasmic diffusion, which may limit intercellular diffusion.\r"

  ".U": "87175657\r", 
  ".W": "Acute administration of iron to rats has been previously shown to induce liver ferritin synthesis by increasing the translation of inactive cytoplasmic ferritin mRNAs for both heavy (H) and light (L) subunits by mobilizing them onto polyribosomes. In this report rat hepatoma cells in culture are used to explore the relationship of this response to intracellular iron levels. After adding iron as ferric ammonium citrate to the medium, latent ferritin H- and L-mRNAs were extensively transferred to polyribosomes, accompanied by increased uptake of [35S]methionine into ferritin protein. Because total cellular levels of L- and H-mRNA were not significantly changed by exposure to iron, the increased ferritin mRNAs on polyribosomes most probably come from an inactive cytoplasmic pool, consistent with the inability of actinomycin-D and of cordycepin to inhibit iron-induced ferritin synthesis. When deferoxamine mesylate, an intracellular iron chelator, was added after the addition of iron to the medium, ferritin mRNA on the polyribosomes was reduced, while the free messenger pool increased, and ferritin synthesis diminished. In contrast, the extracellular iron chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid failed to inhibit the induction of ferritin protein synthesis. Addition of iron in the form of hemin also caused translocation of mRNA to polyribosomes, a response that could be similarly quenched by deferoxamine. Because hemin does not release chelatable iron extracellularly, we conclude that the level of chelatable iron within the cell has a regulatory role in ferritin synthesis through redistribution of the messenger RNAs between the free mRNA pool and the polyribosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PBt2) in the presence of forskolin or cholera toxin caused marked (6- to 8-fold) and rapid accumulation of cAMP in Swiss 3T3 cells. The effect of PBt2 is mediated by protein kinase C because the synthetic diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2 acetylglycerol substitutes for PBt2 in enhancing cAMP accumulation and because the enhancing effect of either PBt2 or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol was prevented by down-regulation of protein kinase C. Vasopressin, which activates protein kinase C but does not directly affect adenylate cyclase in 3T3 cells, also enhanced cAMP accumulation in cells treated with cholera toxin or forskolin. This effect was abolished by down-regulation of protein kinase C. Treatment with pertussis toxin blocked the enhancing effect of PBt2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin neither prevented protein kinase C activation by PBt2 nor other biologic responses elicited by PBt2. The results presented here suggest an unusual function for a pertussis toxin substrate--namely, coupling protein kinase C activation to cAMP production.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by cultured mouse macrophages was markedly promoted by isolated rat mast cell granules present in the culture medium. The granule-mediated uptake of LDL enhanced the rate of cholesteryl ester synthesis in the macrophages, the result being accumulation of cholesteryl esters in these cells. Binding of LDL to the granules was essential for the granule-mediated uptake of LDL by macrophages, for the uptake process was prevented by treating the granules with avidin or protamine chloride or by treating LDL with 1,2-cyclohexanedione, all of which inhibit the binding of LDL to the granules. Inhibition of granule phagocytosis by the macrophages with cytochalasin B also abolished the granule-mediated uptake of LDL. Finally, mouse macrophage monolayers and LDL were incubated in the presence of isolated rat serosal mast cells. Stimulation of the mast cells with compound 48/80, a degranulating agent, resulted in dose-dependent release of secretory granules from the mast cells and a parallel increase in cholesteryl ester synthesis in the macrophages. The results show that, in this in vitro model, the sequence of events leading to accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages involves initial stimulation of mast cells, subsequent release of their secretory granules, binding of LDL to the exocytosed granules, and, finally, phagocytosis of the LDL-containing granules by macrophages.\r"

Once a clone has been derived from a single cell, its growth potential can be estimated from the colony types resulting from a single plating, and the clone can be assigned to one of three classes. The holoclone has the greatest reproductive capacity: under standard conditions, fewer than 5% of the colonies formed by the cells of a holoclone abort and terminally differentiate. The paraclone contains exclusively cells with a short replicative lifespan (not more than 15 cell generations), after which they uniformly abort and terminally differentiate. The third type of clone, the meroclone, contains a mixture of cells of different growth potential and is a transitional stage between the holoclone and the paraclone. The incidence of the different clonal types is affected by aging, since cells originating from the epidermis of older donors give rise to a lower proportion of holoclones and a higher proportion of paraclones.\r"

Lentropin has been partially purified but has not been isolated in sufficient quantity or purity for direct comparison with other growth and differentiation factors. Previous studies have shown that insulin and fetal bovine serum share with lentropin the ability to stimulate lens fiber formation from cultured epithelial cells. In the present study, a number of hormones and growth factors were assayed for lentropin activity. Of those tested, the only substances that had this activity were the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) somatomedin C (Sm-C/IGF-I) and multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA/IGF-II). Sm-C/IGF-I was approximately 30 times more potent than insulin or MSA/IGF-II in promoting fiber cell formation. A monoclonal antibody to human Sm-C/IGF-I inhibited purified Sm-C/IGF-I, fetal bovine serum, and chicken vitreous humor from stimulating fiber cell differentiation in vitro. This antibody has been shown not to crossreact with insulin and did not block insulin-stimulated lens fiber formation. These findings indicate that lentropin is related to the IGFs and that these factors may play important roles in controlling cell differentiation, in addition to their better-known ability to stimulate cell division.\r"

Two cDNA clones, pG8 and pG2, were more highly expressed in normal and neoplastic chromaffin tissue than they are in neuroblastoma. Furthermore, they are expressed in a remarkably limited number of other human tumors or normal tissues. pG8 is highly expressed in medullary thyroid carcinoma, another tumor of neural crest origin, which can occur in association with pheochromocytoma in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type II syndrome. pG2 is highly expressed in the adrenal cortex, an endocrine gland thought to be embryologically unrelated to the neural crest-derived adrenal medulla. The expression of both pG8 and pG2 can be induced in human neuroblastoma cells with dexamethasone, suggesting a mechanism by which glucocorticoids may influence development of a neuroendocrine phenotype.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA was determined and the primary structure of the putative protein was deduced. The proposed protein is rich in glycine, lysine, and tyrosine and its overall amino acid composition agrees with that reported for the F. hepatica egg shell. The clone has homology with DNA from other trematodes; this homology is higher in organisms in which egg development is similar to that of F. hepatica and suggests that the protein is conserved in organisms in which miracidium formation occurs in fresh water.\r"

We report here the identification of three AMP deaminase isoforms during skeletal muscle development in the rat. An embryonic isoform is expressed in the developing hindlimb of the rat between 7 and 14 days of gestation. This isoform is not unique to skeletal muscle or the embryo as it is also expressed in many nonmuscle tissues of the perinatal and adult rat. A perinatal isoform of AMP deaminase that is restricted to skeletal muscle is produced 4-6 days before birth and persists for 2-3 weeks of postnatal life. An adult, skeletal muscle-specific isoform of AMP deaminase appears at birth and reaches maximal levels after 3 weeks of postnatal development. We conclude from these studies there is a developmentally controlled program that leads to the sequential expression of AMP deaminase isoforms during the transition from embryonic to adult skeletal muscle.\r"

The 14C dates indicate that sediment has been accumulating in the lava tube for at least the last 7750 years, a suitable time frame for testing the hypothesis that Holocene extinction on islands began after human colonization. Despite growing evidence that a worldwide wave of extinctions coincided with human colonization of oceanic islands, little radiometric data have been available to date the extinction of most small fossil vertebrates on islands. The TAMS technique of dating purified collagen from the bones of small vertebrates could lead to vastly improved chronologies of extinction for oceanic islands where catastrophic mid- to late-Holocene extinction is expected or known to have occurred. Chronologies derived from nonarcheological sites that show continuous sedimentation, such as the Puu Naio Cave deposit, may also yield key evidence on the timing of earliest human settlement of Oceania.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis proved the hybrid nature of 12 of the lines; 9 of those 12 exhibited low (normal) numbers of SCEs, signifying complementation. The parental BS and EM9 cells, although resembling each other in exhibiting very high SCE frequencies in BrdUrd-containing medium, differ from one another with respect to their proliferative abilities in such medium, the EM9 cells but not the BS cells being exquisitely hypersensitive to BrdUrd. In the low-SCE hybrid lines, hypersensitivity to growth in BrdUrd-containing medium was restored to normal whereas the hypersensitivity was retained by the high-SCE hybrids. It is concluded, first, that the mutations in BS and EM9 cells are different and, second, that both the elevated SCE frequency and the excessive BrdUrd hypersensitivity of EM9 cells are due to the same mutation.\r"

Somatic loss of constitutional heterozygosity was observed at loci on chromosome 13 in primary tumor tissue from three females and one male. In two cases, specific loss of heterozygosity at three distinct genetic loci along the length of the chromosome was observed. In another case, concurrent loss of alleles at loci on chromosomes 2, 13, 14, and 20 was detected, whereas a fourth case showed loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 5 and 13. In each instance, the data were consistent with loss of one of the homologous chromosomes by mitotic nondisjunction. Analysis of loci on several other chromosomes showed retention of constitutional heterozygosity suggesting the relative specificity of the events. In contrast, similar analyses of other breast cancers, including comedocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, and juvenile secretory carcinoma, showed no loss of alleles at loci on chromosome 13. These data indicate that the pathogenesis of ductal breast cancer may, in a substantial proportion of cases, involve unmasking of a recessive locus on chromosome 13 and suggest the involvement of such a locus in heritable forms of this disease.\r"

Four methods for generating human mAbs were compared: fusion with human [LICR-LON-HMy-2 (LICR-2)] or mouse (NS-1) cells; transformation by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); and EBV transformation followed by NS-1 fusion. NS-1 fusion with lymph node lymphocytes resulted in a higher number of growing hybrids than LICR-2 fusion. Virtually no hybrids were obtained from NS-1 or LICR-2 fusions with PBL. EBV transformed lymphocytes from lymph node and peripheral blood with equal efficiency, and the yield of proliferating cultures for antibody screening was more than 10- to 30-fold greater than that obtained by fusion techniques. However, once antibody-producing cultures had been identified, stability and clonability of EBV-transformed cells were poorer than that of NS-1 hybrid cells. To combine the strengths of both methods, cultures of EBV-transformed cells were fused with NS-1; and hybrid clones were isolated that showed vigorous growth, clonability, and stable antibody secretion. Detailed specificity analysis of the mAbs produced by six of these clones indicated detection of a class 1 (unique) melanoma antigen, a class 3 melanoma antigen, and four ganglioside antigens (GD3, GM3, and two other, as yet uncharacterized, heterophile antigens).\r"

Such antibodies enabled us to isolate cDNA clone lambda HB''-1 from a phage lambda gt11 expression library. This clone appeared to code for the B'' protein as established by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA. The identity of clone lambda HB''-1 was further confirmed by partial peptide mapping and analysis of the reactivity of the recombinant antigen with monospecific and monoclonal antibodies. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 1015-base-pair cDNA insert of clone lambda HB''-1 revealed a large open reading frame of 800 nucleotides containing the coding sequence for a polypeptide of 25,457 daltons. In vitro transcription of the lambda HB''-1 cDNA insert and subsequent translation resulted in a protein product with the molecular size of the B'' protein. These data demonstrate that clone lambda HB''-1 contains the complete coding sequence of this antigen. The deduced polypeptide sequence contains three very hydrophilic regions that might constitute RNA binding sites and/or antigenic determinants. These findings might have implications both for the understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases as well as for the elucidation of the biological function of autoimmune antigens.\r"

Evidence for a common mucosal immune system in humans has been scanty because of the difficulty in demonstrating migratory behavior of Peyer's patch cells. In the present study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from human volunteers who had ingested capsules containing killed Streptococcus mutans were assayed for spontaneous antibody-producing cells. Four of five volunteers exhibited circulating IgA-producing cells within 7 days and reached maximum responses by days 10-12. One IgA-deficient subject exhibited IgM responses with identical kinetics. Pokeweed-mitogen-stimulated PBMC produced anti-S. mutans antibodies predominantly of the IgA isotype. Significant S-IgA anti-S. mutans antibodies were detected in saliva and tears by day 14, and the antibodies reached maximum titers by 3 weeks. No changes in serum anti-S. mutans antibodies were noted. The IgA-deficient subject produced salivary secretory IgM antibodies. These results suggest that, after antigen ingestion, peripheral blood contains antigen-specific precursors of IgA plasma cells and that their presence precedes the appearance of S-IgA antibodies in external secretions. Therefore, these experiments provide further support for the existence of a common mucosal immune system in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Tin(IV)-protoporphyrin (Sn-protoporphyrin) potently inhibits heme degradation to bile pigments in vitro and in vivo, a property that confers upon this synthetic compound the ability to suppress a variety of experimentally induced and naturally occurring forms of jaundice in animals and humans. Utilizing rat liver heme oxygenase purified to homogeneity together with appropriate immunoquantitation techniques, we have demonstrated that Sn-protoporphyrin possesses the additional property of potently inducing the synthesis of heme oxygenase protein in liver cells while, concurrently, completely inhibiting the activity of the newly formed enzyme. Substitution of tin for the central iron atom of heme thus leads to the formation of a synthetic heme analogue that regulates heme oxygenase by a dual mechanism, which involves competitive inhibition of the enzyme for the natural substrate heme and simultaneous enhancement of new enzyme synthesis. Cobaltic(III)-protoporphyrin (Co-protoporphyrin) also inhibits heme oxygenase activity in vitro, but unlike Sn-protoporphyrin it greatly enhances the activity of the enzyme in the whole animal. Co-protoporphyrin also acts as an in vivo inhibitor of heme oxygenase; however, its inducing effect on heme oxygenase synthesis is so pronounced as to prevail in vivo over its inhibitory effect on the enzyme. These studies show that certain synthetic heme analogues possess the ability to simultaneously inhibit as well as induce the enzyme heme oxygenase in liver. The net balance between these two actions, as reflected in the rate of heme oxidation activity in the whole animal, appears to be influenced by the nature of the central metal atom of the synthetic metalloporphyrin.\r"

Our present studies demonstrate that these drugs are broad spectrum antiretroviral agents capable of inhibiting the infectivity of evolutionarily divergent mammalian type C and animal lentiviruses. Under some conditions, virus infectivity could be inhibited by more than six orders of magnitude. However, the potency of these agents was shown to be greatly influenced by cell-specified determinants. Drug exposure during the initial 24 hr was almost as effective as prolonged treatment on the inhibition of a single cycle of virus infection and expression. Moreover, virus infection was shown directly to be inhibited at the level of proviral DNA synthesis. Thus the time period during which reverse transcription and provirus integration occur is the critical period required for drug action. Our findings have implications concerning strategies to be considered in attempts to utilize 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides in control and treatment of retrovirus-induced diseases of animals and humans.\r"

Peptide SP-22 absorbed up to 100% of anti-gp120 antibody reactivity from select HIV+ patient sera in immunoblot assays and up to 79% of serum anti-gp120 antibody reactivity in competition RIA. In RIA, 45% of HIV-seropositive subjects had antibodies that bound to peptide SP-22. Human anti-SP-22 antibodies that bound to and were eluted from an SP-22 affinity column reacted with gp120 in RIA and immunoblot assays but did not neutralize HIV or inhibit HIV-induced syncytium formation in vitro, even though these antibodies comprised 70% of all anti-gp120 antibodies in the test serum. In contrast, the remaining 30% of SP-22 nonreactive anti-gp120 antibodies did not react with gp120 in immunoblot assays but did not react in RIA and neutralized HIV in vitro. Thus, approximately 50% of HIV-seropositive patients make high titers of nonneutralizing antibodies to an immunodominant antigen on gp120 defined by SP-22. Moreover, the COOH terminus of gp120 contains the major antigen or antigens identified by human anti-gp120 antibodies in immunoblot assays.\r"

Displacement of 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II binding to rat ovarian membranes by angiotensin II analogs and fragments resembled the potency order of these compounds on angiotensin II receptors in other tissues: [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II greater than angiotensin II greater than des-Asp1-angiotensin II greater than angiotensin I greater than des-Asp1,Arg2-angiotensin II. Several unrelated peptides, including follicle-stimulating hormone at 10 microM, did not displace ovarian 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II binding. Autoradiograms of 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II binding to ovarian sections indicated that the angiotensin II receptor binding sites were localized exclusively to a subpopulation of follicles, occurring on the granulosa and theca interna cells. Other follicles were devoid of 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II binding sites. Angiotensin II immunoreactive material was also identified in the ovary. The concentration of ovarian Ang II immunoreactivity was 8- to 75-fold greater than that of plasma, was not reduced in bilaterally nephrectomized rats, and was shown by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis to be the native angiotensin II octapeptide. The presence of angiotensin II and its receptor binding sites in the ovary suggests a role for angiotensin II as a regulator of ovarian function.\r"

The peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids, measured as the cyanide-insensitive formation of [14C]acetyl units from [14C]palmitoyl-CoA, was very low in the patient (less than 10% of the values in control subjects). Immunoblotting experiments using antibodies to peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes indicated that peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (acyl-CoA:acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.16) was deficient. Addition of purified rat-liver peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase to a reaction mixture containing liver homogenate from the patient restored peroxisomal beta-oxidation. We conclude that the deficiency of peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase is responsible for the very low peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity and for the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids and intermediates in the biosynthesis of bile acids. Furthermore, the finding that both very-long-chain fatty acids and abnormal bile acids accumulate in this patient suggests that a single peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase is involved in the oxidative chain shortening of both very-long-chain fatty acids and the coprostanoic acids.\r"

This virus was passaged an additional three times in monkey kidney cells to obtain sufficient virus for molecular cloning and was designated HM-175/7 MK-5. Three overlapping cDNA clones were obtained that together spanned the entire genome. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of cDNA from wild-type virus (propagated in marmoset liver in vivo) with attenuated virus (grown in cell culture) showed 24 nucleotide changes distributed throughout the genome. Five base deletions occurred in the 5' noncoding region, and 12 of the 16 base substitutions in the coding region resulted in amino acid changes. Amino acid changes occurred in viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 and several of the nonstructural proteins. Thus, a small number of nucleotide changes are responsible for adaptation to cell culture and attenuation of HAV strain HM-175.\r"

After purification by HPLC, the inhibitory activities of these analogs on the release of growth hormone (somatotropin) in rats were determined in vivo. The eight octapeptides with an N-terminal tryptophan residue were found to have a greater inhibitory effect than somatostatin. The most potent of these analogs, D-Trp-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2, was 94.3 times more active than somatostatin. The other analogs, in order of decreasing potency, were Ac-Trp-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2, D-Trp(For)-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2, D-Trp-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2, Ac-Trp(For)-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2, Ac-Trp-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2, D-Trp-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Trp-NH2, and D-Trp-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2. The growth hormone inhibitory activity of these analogs was from 53.7 to 11.6 times greater than that of somatostatin. The octapeptides containing D- or L-tryptophan at the N-terminus, phenylalanine at position 3, and threonine at position 6 exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on growth hormone release than that of the analogs with tyrosine and valine at positions 3 and 6, respectively. Substitution of D-tryptophan for D-phenylalanine at the N-terminus in the octapeptide containing phenylalanine in the third, threonine in the sixth, and threoninamide in the C-terminal position also increased the growth hormone-release inhibitory activity. Time-course assay showed that D-Trp-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2 (RC-98-I), in a dose of 1 microgram/kg of body weight, inhibited the release of growth hormone for at least 3 hr. In view of their high activity and prolonged duration of action, some of these analogs could be useful clinically.\r"

In this report, the tools of molecular genetics, monoclonal antibodies, and analytical and synthetic chemistry have been combined to determine the structure of this epitope. This epitope is attributed to the presence of a trisaccharide of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) of the sequence KDOp-(2----8)-KDOp-(2----4)-KDO. The structure includes a unique linkage of two KDO residues through a 2.8-linkage.\r"

  ".U": "87175705\r", 
  ".W": "Two classes of calcium channels were activated by membrane depolarization in cell-free membrane patches from GH3 cells, an electrically excitable cell line derived from a mammalian pituitary tumor. One class had a conductance of approximately 10 pS in 90 mM barium, had a threshold of activation near -40 mV, and was inactivated rapidly at holding potentials more positive than -80 mV. The other class, with a conductance of approximately 23 pS and a threshold nearer -20 mV, did not inactivate in barium but stopped responding to depolarization altogether when the cytoplasmic side of the patch was exposed to a standard physiological saline solution. Buffering the concentration of calcium ions to less than 10 nM on the cytoplasmic side did not prevent this loss of activity. However, activity was restored and maintained for the duration of the patch when the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was added with MgATP to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Cell-free patch formation in the presence of the dihydropyridine, BAY K 8644, also delayed the loss of activity, but unlike the catalytic subunit plus ATP, BAY K 8644 alone did not restore activity when it was added after the channels no longer responded to depolarization. Evidently the dihydropyridine-sensitive class of voltage-activated calcium channels must be phosphorylated in order to open when the membrane is depolarized. That hypothesis provides a simple framework for understanding the modulation of calcium channel gating by neurotransmitters, calcium ions, and dihydropyridines.\r"

  ".W": "Central nervous system (CNS) neurons of mammals regenerate poorly after axonal injury. However, if an injured CNS neuron (rabbit optic nerve) is supplied with appropriate soluble substances (\"growth-associated triggering factors\") derived from medium conditioned by regenerating fish optic nerve or newborn rabbit optic nerve, it can express regeneration-associated characteristics. Such characteristics include a general increase in protein synthesis, changes in synthesis of specific polypeptides, and sprouting of nerve fibers in culture. The present study of rabbit optic nerves demonstrates that such active substances affect the neuronal environment (i.e., the non-neuronal cells), thereby perhaps causing a shift in the environment from an inhibitory to a regenerative supportive one. Apparently, such an environment is spontaneously achieved in injured CNS nerves of lower vertebrates (e.g., fish optic nerves), which are regenerable. Treatment of injured rabbit optic nerve with soluble factors from medium conditioned by regenerating carp optic nerve resulted in a selective increase in proliferation ([3H]thymidine incorporation) of perineural cells and the appearance of a 12-kDa polypeptide in a homogenate derived from the nerve and its associated cells. This polypeptide may be related to growth, since it comigrates in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 12-kDa polypeptide that is continuously present in a regenerative system. In addition, there were injury-induced changes in the polypeptides of the nerve that were independent of treatment with conditioned medium and were correlated with nerve maturation. The most prominent changes of this type were in 18-kDa and 25-kDa polypeptides whose levels were reduced after injury and were found to be correlated with the nerve maturation (myelination) state.\r"

Acute morphine pretreatment substantially reduces the magnitude of the evoked release of this peptide from opiate-naive ilea. However, the rate of the evoked release of enkephalin from morphine-pretreated, tolerant/dependent preparations is indistinguishable from that observed for untreated, naive ilea. Paradoxically, 15 min after acute in vitro withdrawal of morphine form such preparations, the presence of morphine appears to be prerequisite for the manifestation of electrically evoked release of methionine enkephalin. The evoked release of this peptide from ilea 60 min after withdrawal is no longer dependent upon morphine. Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in the rate of enkephalin release from these preparations is almost double that observed for opiate-naive ilea. These data indicate that the manifestation of opiate tolerance/dependence for the release of methionine enkephalin from enteric ganglia comprises several adaptive processes, the consequences of which can be observed at different stages of withdrawal.\r"

The neuron was stimulated extracellularly at the soma, and the evoked AcCho release was monitored at the growth cone, along the neurite, and near the soma. For a majority of the neurons studied, a brief suprathreshold stimulation of the soma triggered a pulse of AcCho release from the growth cone. This release showed many of the characteristics reminiscent of the transmitter release at the nerve terminal of a mature neuromuscular synapse: it occurs within a few ms following the stimulation, depends on extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and exhibits depression and potentiation during and after high-frequency stimulation, respectively. Similar evoked release was also observed only at selected points along the neurite, and prolonged suprathreshold stimulus was required to induce release from the soma. These results indicate that some of the growing spinal neurons have acquired a substantial number of AcCho molecules as well as an efficient mechanism for excitation-secretion coupling at the growth cone, ready for establishing functional contact with the target muscle cell. This notion was further supported by the finding that the evoked AcCho release is capable of inducing suprathreshold excitation of the muscle cell within the first minute following neurite-muscle contact.\r"

The results indicate that the inheritance of color vision in the squirrel monkey can be explained by assuming that the three middle- to long-wavelength cone pigments are specified by three alleles at a single locus on the X chromosome. This arrangement is discretely different from that found in Old World monkeys and humans.\r"

As a direct test of this idea, we compared acetylcholine-activated single-channel currents from the synaptic membrane to those obtained from nonsynaptic sites on freshly dissociated adult mouse toe muscle. We observed, at locations along the entire length of the cell, openings by a channel with a high conductance (70 pS) and brief open time (approximately 2 msec), characteristic of the classical \"junctional type\" of acetylcholine receptor. In 8 out of 10 synaptic and in 9 out of 19 nonsynaptic recordings, we also observed infrequent openings by a low-conductance (45-pS) channel traditionally associated only with nonsynaptic regions. In these recordings the low-conductance acetylcholine receptor channel averaged only 3% of the total channel openings. Comparisons of synaptic and nonsynaptic patches indicated no trend toward an increased proportion of low-conductance channel openings with increased distance from the synapse. These findings support the view that the functional properties of the acetylcholine receptor channel do not depend on proximity to the synapse in innervated mouse skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the molecules on the neuronal surface that mediate axonal growth on myotubes, we have examined neurite formation by ciliary neurons grown on myotubes in the absence or presence of specific antibodies. Dramatic inhibition of neurite outgrowth was seen only when antibodies blocked simultaneously the functions of two cell adhesion molecules--neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and neural Ca2+-dependent CAM (N-Cal-CAM)--and the neuronal receptors for several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Although the antibody used to block ECM receptors (JG22) has been shown to eliminate almost all neurite growth on ECMs, it had only small effects on neurite growth on myotubes, reducing somewhat the length of neurites. Similarly, antibodies to the two CAMs, when used alone, had no detectable effects on neurite length and, when used together, had only small inhibitory effects on neurite growth. Combination of anti-ECM receptor (JG22) with antibodies to either CAM, however, greatly shortened the length of neurites. These results imply that ECM receptors and the CAMs N-CAM and N-Cal-CAM are major macromolecules used by neuronal growth cones for interactions with myotubes. Each provides a distinct mechanism for regulating growth cone motility.\r"

  ".U": "87175714\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism of rectification of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel was examined with single-channel recording techniques in isolated ventricular myocytes from adult guinea pig heart. Inward, or anomalous, rectification describes the property that potassium (K) current can enter the cell at potentials negative to the potassium equilibrium potential, EK, more readily than it can leave the cell at positive potentials. Voltage ramps applied to single inward rectifier channels in cell-attached patches produced single-channel currents that rectified strongly with a marked reduction in current at a potential near EK. At more positive potentials no current could be detected. Rectification was influenced by external and internal K concentrations. Single-channel activity, which usually disappears rapidly in excised patches, could be maintained by removing calcium from the internal solution. Rectification could be eliminated by excision of the patch into an internal solution in which free magnesium (Mg2+) was reduced to less than 1 microM, and it could be restored by the addition of approximately 1 mM Mg2+ to the internal solution. At intermediate concentrations of Mg2+, intermediate degrees of rectification were obtained, and the current at potentials positive to EK was often interrupted by brief closures. These studies suggest that rectification is due to internal block by Mg2+, possibly the result of rapid block of the open channel.\r"

Various weighted sums and differences of these images were then formed. Weighted subtraction allowed formation of hybrid images with high contrast between tumor and all adjacent normal tissues (muscle, fat, bone marrow), unlike the original T1- and T2-weighted images. Certain weighted sums of the acquired images simultaneously display the high signal-to-noise and clear anatomic detail of the T1-weighted technique along with the high contrast between extraosseous tumor and muscle of the T2-weighted image. A single hybrid MR image can contain useful characteristics both of T1- and T2-weighted images, making it easier for one to detect the extent of an abnormality.\r"

This specific leukemic breakpoint is within the metallothionein gene cluster, which is here shown to be proximal to the rare fragile site (FRA16B) and to a common fragile site (FRA16C) in this region.

There was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of the dysmorphic features and both the presence of opportunistic infections within the first year of life and the age at onset of symptoms associated with immune dysfunction, with the more severely stigmatized children manifesting symptoms at a younger age. There was no correlation, however, between severity of the dysmorphic features and presence of opportunistic infections at the time of our examination. We conclude that this scoring system may be useful in presymptomatic identification of severely dysmorphic human immunodeficiency virus-infected infants.\r"

Urinary PGE2 excretion (as an index of renal PGE2 production) as well as urine volume, urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and creatinine clearance were examined in 19 patients with cirrhosis and either no ascites, diuretic-responsive ascites, or diuretic-resistant ascites. Measurements were made both before (all patients) and after (ascitic patients) stimulation of renal PGE2 synthesis by 80 mg of furosemide intravenously. Urinary PGE2 excretion was similar in the three groups both before and after furosemide. Baseline urine volume and creatinine clearance were similar in all groups but were significantly less after furosemide in patients with diuretic-resistant ascites as compared to the other two groups. The natriuretic response to intravenous furosemide was significantly less in patients with diuretic-resistant ascites. Insertion of the peritoneovenous shunt to aid in the management of diuretic-resistant ascites resulted in a marked, immediate increase in urine volume and urinary PGE2 excretion in the four patients who were serially evaluated, but natriuresis occurred in only two. Overall, urinary PGE2 excretion correlated with urine volume but not with sodium excretion or creatinine clearance. Diminished renal PGE2 production, as reflected by urinary PGE2 excretion, does not appear to be a determinant of the severity of renal sodium retention in cirrhosis.\r"

When cimetidine was stopped, bone marrow recovered, and myalgia and encephalopathy subsided. Immunological studies showed stimulation of the patient's lymphocyte blastogenesis by cimetidine and a marked increase in the proportion of cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocytes after incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with cimetidine for 6 days.

Although they copurify during preparation and their gene loci are mapped to the short arm of the human X chromosome where they appear to have escaped from X inactivation, it has not been settled whether STS and ARC are the same enzyme or not. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that ARC exists in two electrophoretically distinct forms in human fibroblasts. We now report that these two forms--the faster migrating (F) and more slowly migrating (S)--occur in human tissues. Each of 11 human tissue types from 10 subjects showed a consistent pattern of ARC isozymes. Thyroid, heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, and adrenal tissue mainly had the S form. In contrast, kidney, liver, and pancreas tissue had mainly the F form, while gonadal, lung, and intestinal tissue had both the S and the F forms. The question of escape of their gene locus from X-chromosome inactivation was examined by comparing the specific activities of ARC and STS in male-derived vis-a-vis female-derived tissues. The majority of the tissues did not show any significant difference in these activities between the sexes, the exceptions being heart muscle, gonadal, and kidney tissue. None showed the 1:2 ratio between male- and female-derived tissues expected of a locus that had escaped X inactivation. The question of identity between ARC and STS was examined by comparing the ratios of their activities in these tissue types: if the enzymes were identical, the ratios of their activities should have remained constant across the different tissue types. It was thus shown that ARC activity varied by as much as 100-fold, depending on the ARC isozymic pattern of the tissue. STS, measured as estrone sulfatase and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfatase, did not show similar variations. This provides further evidence that ARC activity is not necessarily identical to that of STS.\r"

These karyotypes include both extra unidentified structurally abnormal chromosomes (EUSAC)--often denoted as \"markers\"--and extra identified structurally abnormal chromosomes (EISAC). The rate of all EUSAC was 0.64/1,000 (0.32-0.40/1,000 mutant and 0.23-0.32 inherited), and that of all EISAC was 0.11/1,000 (0.07/1,000 mutant and 0.04/1,000 inherited). The rate of all ESAC was approximately 0.8/1,000-0.4-0.5/1,000 mutant and 0.3-0.4/1,000 inherited. Mean +/- SD maternal age of mutant cases was 37.5 +/- 2.9, significantly greater than the value of 35.8 years in controls. A regression analysis indicated a rate of change of the log of the rate of about +0.20 with each year of maternal age between 30 and 45 years. When paternal age was introduced, the maternal age coefficient increased to about +0.25--close to that seen for 47, +21--but the paternal age coefficient was -0.06. After being matched for maternal age and year of diagnosis, the case-control difference in paternal age for 24 mutant cases was -2.4 with a 95% confidence interval of -4.6 to -0.1 years. In a regression analysis of the effects of both parental ages on the (log) rate, the maternal age coefficient was +0.25 and the paternal age coefficient was -0.06. These results are consistent with a (weak) negative paternal age effect in the face of a strong maternal age effect. Since ESAC include a heterogeneous group of abnormalities, the maternal age and paternal age trends, if not the result of statistical fluctuation or undetected biases, may involve different types of events. Data in the literature suggest that chromosomes with de novo duplicated inversions of 15p have a strong maternal age effect (but little paternal age effect). Such chromosomes, however, do not account for the active maternal age trends seen in the data analyzed here. Inherited ESAC exhibited no such trends.\r"

Neither antihistamine, antiserotonin, anticholinergic nor epinephrine therapy was entirely effective or protective; only modification of running prevented episodes. Three similar episodes were noted at age 15 years by a brother who, now age 25, relates a 4-year history of seasonal rhinitis and exercise-related urticaria without anaphylactoid reaction. The remainder of the family (father, 47; mother, 46; brother, 22 years) does not have exercise intolerance. The father has allergic rhinitis; his nephew suffers exercise-induced urticaria without collapse. HLA typing revealed the father to be A1-B8-DR3, A3-B8-DR3; the symptomatic daughter to be A3-B8-DR3, A30-B5-DR8; and the symptomatic son to be A3-B8-DR3, A30-B5-DR8.

An open three-compartment body model was used to calculate ofloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters. In healthy subjects, the peak plasma level averaged 2.24 +/- 0.90 micrograms/ml and was obtained at 0.83 +/- 0.31 h. The absorption rate constant was 4.22 +/- 1.64 h-1. The terminal half-life was 7.86 +/- 1.81 h. The apparent volume of distribution was 2.53 +/- 0.78 liters/kg. Total body and renal clearances were 241.4 +/- 53.8 and 196.5 +/- 42.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. A total of 68.4 +/- 11.9% of the dose was recovered unchanged in 24-h urine. In uremic patients, the terminal half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal failure: from 8 h in normal subjects to 37 h in severely uremic patients. Renal insufficiency did not significantly modify the peak plasma level, the apparent volume of distribution, the fractional clearance, or the nonrenal clearance of ofloxacin. However, the time to peak level was delayed in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min. Linear relationships were found between ofloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters and glomerular filtration rate data. Ofloxacin is only very slightly removed by hemodialysis. Dosage adjustments of ofloxacin in uremic patients are proposed.\r"

In 87 of the 113 patients whose tumour was producing CA 125, a good correlation was observed between the CA 125 levels and the clinical follow-up: 95.7% of the patients in remission had levels less than 35 U/ml, whereas all the patients with no change or with a progressive disease had levels greater than 35 U/ml. Furthermore in recurrent disease the levels of CA 125 were also increased (greater than 35 U/ml) in 92.3% of the patients. Thus, CA 125 measurements at regular intervals are of great clinical value in following the evolution of a tumour or the success of a therapy, but unfortunately do not allow detection of an ovarian tumour at an early stage.\r"

Their serum CA 125 levels ranged from 36 to 8670 U/ml and a correlation with tumour stage was found. Also, during progressive disease, 49 of 53 patients showed elevated levels. At the time of second-look operations, elevated serum CA 125 levels indicated the presence of tumour. However, the presence of small tumour residues (less than 2 cm) and of microscopically detectable tumour in biopsies were not associated with raised CA 125 levels, only a few patients (2 of 13 and 2 of 17, respectively) showed levels higher than 35 U/ml before the second-look operation. Rising levels preceded the clinical discovery of a relapse in 15 of the 22 patients with a median lead time of 3.5 months (1-17 months), and in three patients rising levels were found at the time the tumour recurrence was detected. It is concluded that CA 125, despite its general usefulness, is unable to detect tumour nodules of less than 2 cm in size, but it proved to be a sensitive and early indicator of tumour recurrence and progression.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one patients with previously untreated or minimally treated chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase received human alpha interferon 3 to 9 X 10(6) units intramuscularly (IM) daily until complete hematologic remission, then at doses ranging from 3 X 10(6) units every other day to 9 X 10(6) units daily. Forty-one (80%) patients achieved a hematologic response, 36 (71%) of them attaining a complete hematologic remission with normal peripheral WBC and differential counts. Responding patients showed continuous but slow normalization of several other blood and marrow parameters including platelet counts, serum lactic dehydrogenase and B12 levels, and marrow cellularity and maturation index. Suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome on serial cytogenetic studies of marrow metaphases was documented in 20 of the 36 patients who achieved complete hematologic remission (56%; 39% of total group), eight of whom (22%) had a decrease of the Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases to less than 35%. These changes were persistent for 6 months or longer in 18 patients, seven of whom had continuous suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome to less than 90% for a median of 30+ months (range 21+ to 39+ months). After a median follow-up period of 37 months, 25 patients remain in continued disease control with interferon therapy. The projected 3-year survival rate is 76%, with a yearly death rate of 6%, 9%, and 9% in the first 3 years. Response, Philadelphia chromosome suppression, and survival were significantly better among patients in the low-risk category compared to intermediate- and high-risk categories, as defined by a multivariate analysis-derived prognostic model. The projected 3-year survival rate was 94% for patients who achieved a complete hematologic remission on interferon therapy and 45% for those who did not. Thirteen patients have developed blastic crisis, six with lymphoid and three with undifferentiated morphology. We conclude that human leukocyte alpha interferon effectively controls chronic myeloid leukemia and allows reappearance of diploid hemopoietic cells in some patients.\r"

The remaining nine cases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), seven lacking the common ALL antigen and two having cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (pre-B phenotype). Twenty-five cases (93%) had an abnormal karyotype, 21 (84%) being pseudodiploid. Chromosomal translocations were detected in 67% of the ANLL cases and in 78% of the ALL cases. Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities included the t(9;11)(p21-22;q23) in three cases of monocytic leukemia, inversion of chromosome 16 in three cases of myelomonocytic leukemia with bone marrow eosinophilia, and t(4;11)(q21;q23) in one case of ALL. Chromosomal regions preferentially involved in infant leukemia included 11q23-25 (13 cases), 9p21-22 and 10p11-13. All but one of the 24 cases with chromosomal breakage or rearrangement had breakpoints that corresponded to known fragile sites, half of which were at 11q23-25, a finding that may have pathogenetic importance. The CALLA- or pre-B phenotype and the presence of chromosomal translocations in most infants with ALL provide a biological explanation for their poor prognosis.\r"

These compounds could potentially be useful in purging bone marrow of leukemic cells in autologous marrow transplantation in acute leukemia. To determine the efficacy of pharmacological purging by ALP, we have designed a human assay system to mimic the conditions expected in the clinical setting of autotransplantation using remission marrow. A simulated remission marrow (SRM) was prepared by mixing normal marrow cells and HL60 cells in a ratio of 1,000:1. The effect of cryopreservation on ALP-treated normal, HL60, and SRM cells was examined. In separate experiments, ALP significantly reduced the number of clonogenic HL60 cells with no effect on normal marrow progenitors. The effect of ALP was more apparent after cryopreservation. Incubation of HL60 cells with 50 micrograms/mL ALP for four hours followed by cryopreservation resulted approximately in a 3 log reduction of clonogenic HL60 cells. ALP also selectively purged the small number of leukemic cells from SRM. In SRM, the data suggested that ALP had indirect cytotoxic activity on leukemic cells by enhancing the cytotoxic activity of monocytes in addition to its direct effect. We found no evidence that clonogenic HL60 cells decreased because of induction of differentiation by ALP. These data indicated that treatment of marrow cells with ALP offers an efficient means to eliminate leukemic cells from the graft.\r"

Although this virus induces fibrosarcomas in mice, a recombinant murine retrovirus carrying both the raf and myc oncogenes induces immunoblastic lymphomas and immortalizes mouse macrophages in vitro. The present study has thus monitored the expression of c-raf in human hematopoietic cells. The results demonstrate the presence of a 3.6-kb c-raf transcript in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells. The induction of HL-60 cell differentiation along the monocytic or granulocytic lineages had no detectable effect on the level of c-raf transcripts. Furthermore, in contrast to c-myc and c-fms expression, inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide had no detectable effect on c-raf expression. Similar levels of c-rafRNA were also found in other human cell lines derived from myeloid, B cell, and T cell tumors, as well as in normal granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. These findings suggest that the c-raf protooncogene is widely expressed in multiple hematopoietic lineages.\r"

In one patient, whole-body strontium kinetics agreed closely with the ICRP standard model, while in the second, retention was extremely prolonged, probably due to hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Strontium-85 scintigraphy, surface counting and high-resolution whole-body profiles agreed in showing that in both patients tumour turnover of strontium was very rapid, with a biological half-life of only a few days. Absorbed dose to tumour was found to be comparable in magnitude to the mean bone-marrow dose. We have no reason to believe that 89Sr therapy was of clinical benefit to either patient.\r"

  ".W": "Hormonal control of cAMP production in the osteoclast has not been investigated in detail because this bone-resorbing cell has been difficult to isolate. We have used osteoclasts freshly isolated by disaggregation from neonatal rat long bones and settled onto coverslips (100-150 cells per coverslip) to examine the effects of calcitonin and prostaglandin E2 on osteoclast cAMP levels and cytoplasmic spreading. Salmon, eel, and human calcitonin (CT), and various analogs, stimulated cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner with relative potencies as seen in other response systems. Forskolin (10(-7) M) increased the sensitivity and amplitude of the response. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml for 3 h) had no effect suggesting that CT does not act through Ni, the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory unit of adenylate cyclase. CT treatment was associated with rapid and dose-dependent induction of a persistent activated state of adenylate cyclase and homologous desensitization, the former being a particular feature of CT action previously observed in nonosteoclastic cells. Quantitative histomorphometry demonstrated a sensitive, dose dependent, and prolonged (greater than 2 h) reduction in osteoclast plan area after exposure to salmon CT. Although prostaglandin E2 also stimulated cAMP production and resulted in cell contraction in osteoclasts this was not associated with persistent activation of adenylate cyclase nor with prolonged contraction. Persistent activation of adenylate cyclase may be an important mechanism in CT inhibition of osteoclast function.\r"

Cytoplasmic concentrations of GH, PRL, and LH beta-subunit mRNA were measured in parallel. Marked increases in serum TSH and TSH beta and alpha mRNA were found in hypothyroidism; these changes reversed 72 h after beginning T3 replacement. A more marked effect of hypothyroidism on TSH beta mRNA than on alpha mRNA was evident, suggesting differential control of regulation of the TSH genes. In contrast to a rapid fall in serum TSH after T3 administration, an increase in TSH beta and alpha mRNA was evident at 1 and 6 h, followed by a later fall in TSH mRNA to euthyroid values. Pituitary cytoplasmic concentrations of GH and PRL mRNA were reduced in hypothyroidism and increased after administration of T3; LH beta mRNA was unaffected by hypothyroidism or T3 replacement. The differential effects of thyroid status on TSH, GH, PRL, and LH mRNA indicate specificity of regulation of these anterior pituitary hormone genes.\r"

  ".U": "87190162\r", 
  ".W": "An isolated perfused rabbit ovary preparation was used to determine the effects of cyanoketone, a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, on ovulation, ovum maturation and fertilizability, and steroid production. In the first experiment, cyanoketone (10(-4) M) was added to the perfusate of one ovary. The contralateral control ovary was perfused with medium alone. Thirty minutes after the onset of perfusion, hCG (50 IU) was added to the perfusate of both ovaries. The ovulatory efficiency of ovaries treated with cyanoketone plus hCG (82.3 +/- 4.6%) was similar to that of ovaries treated with hCG alone (84.8 +/- 4.4%). No difference was observed in the degree of ovum maturity or degeneration between control and cyanoketone-treated ovaries. Progesterone and estradiol production were significantly reduced by cyanoketone treatment; concentrations in the perfusate of ovaries treated with cyanoketone were 9.7% and 8.0% of the control values, respectively, 2 h after exposure to hCG. The concentration of 17-hydroxypregnenolone was not affected by cyanoketone treatment. Exposure to cyanoketone resulted in a significant (P less than 0.005) reduction in the fertilizability of ova ovulated and fertilized in vitro. In the second experiment, the percentage of ova that showed evidence of normal fertilization was significantly (P less than 0.025) increased in ovaries perfused with cyanoketone plus estradiol (64.5%) compared to that in ovaries perfused with cyanoketone alone (32.4%). In the third experiment, the addition of progesterone to the perfusate did not affect fertilizability of ovulated ova in ovaries perfused with cyanoketone plus estradiol. These results suggest that the presence of estradiol in the ovarian steroid environment may be essential for fertilizability of ova, but not for the processes of ovulation or meiotic maturation.\r"

The average size was 1.8 cm in the greatest diameter in benign mucinous cystadenomas, about 5 cm in borderline tumors, and more than 8 cm in mucinous cystadenocarcinomas. Histologically, in all borderline and malignant lesions, the cysts contained areas lined with epithelium and had a benign appearance, comparable with that of mucinous cystadenoma. These observations suggest a borderline or malignant disease in the case of a benign mucinous cystadenoma. An immunohistochemical study for carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 showed denser and diffuse localizations of such materials in the cytoplasm and the stroma in the case of malignant lesions, as compared to findings in borderline and benign cases.\r"

Significantly fewer positive cases were obtained with serum CA 19-9 (9%) and CA 125 (8%) tests than the CEA test (22%) (both p less than 0.05) in patients with benign diseases, while comparable sensitivities were achieved with the CA 19-9 (44%) test, the CA 125 (41%) test and the CEA test (47%) in those with a carcinoma. High incidences of raised concentrations of serum CA 19-9 and CA 125 were observed in case of cancer of the pancreas (CA 19-9: 87%, CA 125: 67%) and biliary tract (CA 19-9: 63%, CA 125: 48%). Combined tests of CA 19-9 and CA 125 revealed increments in the sensitivity (61%) and provided a higher specificity (87%) than that of the single CEA test (78%). These combined tests were most useful for a differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma (97% positive) and biliary tract carcinoma (74%) from chronic pancreatitis (4%) and cholelithiasis (0%), respectively. Studies on the relations of clinical staging and serum concentrations of CA 19-9 and CA 125 revealed significant rises in cases of disseminated carcinoma. These results clearly show that serum CA 19-9 and CA 125 tests are most pertinent for diagnosing advanced carcinomas of organs in the digestive system.\r"

The potential reserve of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) was first assessed by exogenous nicotinic stimulation with 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). A dose of 250 micrograms/kg iv DMPP caused an increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration from 207 +/- 86 (basal) to 2,625 +/- 448 pg/ml (P less than 0.02) and in plasma epinephrine (EPI) from 10 +/- 5.0 to 1,410 +/- 432 pg/ml (P less than 0.05) in four swine. In four other swine, bronchoconstriction induced by aerosolized prostaglandin F2 alpha caused approximately a fivefold increase in airway resistance without hemodynamic changes. No increase in plasma EPI was observed. However, plasma NE increased from 330 +/- 131 to 1,540 +/- 182 pg/ml (P less than 0.02). In five swine receiving aerosolized acetylcholine (ACh), similar changes in airways resistance were not associated with significant changes in catecholamine concentration when mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was unchanged. However, inhalation of sufficient ACh to cause a greater than 10% decrease in MAP caused progressive increase in catecholamine secretion. Plasma EPI increased from 32 +/- 16 (MAP = 124 +/- 7 Torr) to 1,165 +/- 522 pg/ml (MAP = 94 +/- Torr). Hypoxemia that occurred with bronchoconstriction (greater than or equal to 50 Torr) did not cause catecholamine secretion. However, severe hypoxemia (PO2 less than 30 Torr) caused large increases in plasma EPI concentrations from 84 +/- 27 to 1,463 +/- 945 pg/ml (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

His major symptoms were watery diarrhea, flushing, and abdominal bloating; these and the elevated plasma PP levels did not change after resection of the distal two thirds of the pancreas, which contained a 2-cm mass of nesidioblastotic tissue. Postoperatively, a long-acting somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (100 micrograms/day), normalized PP secretion acutely and chronically (7 months) and ameliorated his symptoms. The analog had no side-effects and did not alter glucose tolerance, calcitonin hypersecretion, or growth of the medullary carcinoma, but it did inhibit GH secretion. After withdrawal from therapy for 1 month, PP hypersecretion and all symptoms except diarrhea recurred. The coexistence of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and PP cell nesidioblastosis represents a new variant of the overlap syndromes between multiple endocrine neoplasia types I and II. Patients with medullary carcinoma and unexplained watery diarrhea should have fasting gastroenteropancreatic hormone assays done to screen for a potential gastrointestinal or pancreatic origin for the diarrhea.\r"

Ovalbumin induced the release of 7.9 ng of histamine, 40 pg of immunoreactive sulfidopeptide-leukotriene, and 140 pg of immunoreactive-PgD2 per ganglion. Ovalbumin produced long-lasting potentiation (51 +/- 4%, mean +/- SEM, n = 66) of synaptic transmission, the protracted nature of which could not be mimicked by exogenous histamine (10(-5) M). Selective histamine H1 antagonists inhibited the antigen-induced potentiation, but did not reverse it when added any time after antigen exposure. These results indicate that immunologic activation of mast cells can directly potentiate neurotransmission in sympathetic ganglia. Histamine appears to be a mediator involved in the induction of antigen-induced potentiation of synaptic transmission, but alone cannot account for the long term nature of this phenomenon.\r"

However, mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Because cellular oncogenes play a pivotal role in regulating proliferation and differentiation, we examined whether cAMP-promoted differentiation of HL-60 was preceded by a decrease in the expression of c-myc, a cellular oncogene both amplified and constitutively expressed in HL-60. We find that cyclic AMP elevation in HL-60 caused by three different pharmacologic regimens is followed by an abrupt, greater than 90% decrease in steady state c-myc mRNA levels within 3 h, well before detectable changes in proliferation and differentiation. This decrease, which occurs despite protein synthetic blockade, is attributable to transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc and is accompanied by changes in chromatin structure near c-myc promoter sites. Our findings establish that cAMP, a ubiquitous intracellular regulatory messenger previously known only to enhance gene transcriptional activity in higher eukaryotic cells, can also suppress transcription of a cellular oncogene, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for cAMP-promoted differentiation.\r"

Because of their specificity to the unique epitopes different from class II antigens, they are designated as anti-Iat reagents. The present study demonstrated that these anti-Iat inhibit the H-2k-restricted helper T (Th) cell function by acting on the very H-2 restriction site of both H-2k and H-2kxb F1 T cells. This was determined by both the cytotoxic treatment and blocking of antigen-primed Th cells. In the F1 Th population, only those restricted to H-2k were eliminated, leaving the H-2b-restricted Th cells uninhibited. The inhibition of the response was not due to the induction of suppressor T cells, but to the elimination of the function of radioresistant Lyt-1+,2- Th cells. Iatk epitopes were also found on an H-2k-restricted but not on H-2b-restricted Th cell clone established from the same H-2kxb F1 animal. None of the anti-Iatk were reactive with class II antigens on B cells. These results indicate that Iat epitopes are not directly encoded by the I region genes, but are associated with the H-2 restriction site of T cells, which see the self class II polymorphism. Thus, Iat epitopes are expressed clonally in high frequency on H-2k-restricted Th cells of F1, being excluded from the H-2b-restricted Th population. The relationship between Iat and T cell receptor molecules is unknown.\r"

While HLA-ABC antigens were strongly expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and the infundibular epithelium of hair follicles in all biopsies, these antigens were either not detectable or only faintly expressed on the subinfundibular epithelium and the hair matrix in the control series. By contrast, 30 out of 32 biopsies from untreated AA showed expression of HLA-ABC antigens on hair matrix epithelium, and the subinfundibular epithelium was HLA-ABC-positive in 15 out of 32 cases. In the biopsies from treated AA, HLA-ABC antigens were expressed on hair matrix epithelium in 9 out of 13 cases, and on the subinfundibular epithelium in 1 case. In the controls and untreated AA, HLA-DR expression was confined to dendritic cells in the epidermis and the follicular infundibulum.

In the control series, intrabulbar T6+ dendritic cells were either absent or present in low numbers. High numbers of intrabulbar T6+ cells were present in 7 out of 32 biopsies from untreated AA and in 0 out of 13 biopsies from treated AA. The data show that abnormal expression of class I major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens on hair matrix epithelium is a constant feature in AA, whereas class II MHC antigens are less frequently expressed. Topical immunotherapy with DCP, which induced expression of HLA-DR in epidermal keratinocytes in 6 out of 13 cases, reduced the abnormal expression of both HLA-ABC and -DR antigens in the epithelium of lower hair follicles in AA.\r"

  ".W": "A serological survey of 317 healthy residents of rural Papua New Guinea (PNG) showed a 26% prevalence of antibodies to human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Antibody to HTLV-I was detected in 16% of children less than or equal to 10 years old (including an 18-month-old child) and increased to greater than or equal to 24% in subjects greater than 20 years old. Prospective examination for antibody in 104 residents of one village revealed a seroconversion rate of 13% over a one-year period. The mean titer of antibody in these subjects (1:183) was lower (P less than .0005) than that in persons who were persistently seropositive (1:718). Analysis for clustering of infected subjects suggested that personal contact within the home played a role in the horizontal spread of HTLV-I. These data indicate that HTLV-I infection has a higher prevalence in PNG than in other endemic parts of the world, exposure occurs at an early age, and infection and/or seroconversion is common in adults as well as in children.\r"

None of 118 men with chancroid seen in 1980 had antibody to HIV compared with 15% of 107 such men in 1985. Among pregnant women, 2.0% were seropositive in 1985 versus none of 111 in 1981. Seropositive prostitutes and women with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) tended to have more sex partners and had a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea, and in women with STDs, significantly more seropositive women practiced prostitution. Pregnant women and men with STDs who were born in the most-western region of Kenya were more likely to have antibody to HIV than were such groups from other geographic areas. Our results indicate that the AIDS virus was recently introduced into Kenya, that HIV can rapidly disseminate in a high-risk group of heterosexuals, and that prostitutes may have significantly contributed to the spread of the virus.\r"

MTX clearance was impaired in seven of the ten patients studied after cisplatin therapy. Patients with a urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) concentration of greater than 1.5 U/mmol creatinine or a greater than 50% increase in serum creatinine relative to the pretherapy level were approximately 30 times more likely to have MTX half-lives greater than 3.5 hours than were patients with lower values for these markers; MTX clearance was always impaired if both markers were elevated. If neither urinary NAG nor serum creatinine concentrations increased, the risk of impaired MTX excretion was negligible. Our findings demonstrate that urinary NAG and serum creatinine levels, measured before MTX administration, can be used to identify patients who will have difficulty in clearing the drug.\r"

In the final diagnosis 39 had primary lung carcinoma, four metastases in lung, mediastinum, and pleura from carcinomas elsewhere, and 22 benign pulmonary diseases. The sensitivity in the detection of pulmonary malignancies was 91% with 67Ga and 95% with [99mTc]GH. The intensity of uptake was somewhat greater with 67Ga than with [99mTc]GH in almost all malignant lung tumor groups. The specificity to detect malignant tumors was 82% with both radiopharmaceuticals. Irradiation and chemotherapy seemed to decrease 67Ga uptake but not [99mTc]GH uptake. Only four of 22 benign diseases showed accumulation of both 67Ga and [99mTc]GH. The intensity of uptake in benign processes was almost equal with that in malignant diseases, but most malignant processes were better delineated than the benign lesions. There were many differences between 67Ga and [99mTc]GH uptake, which suggest different mechanisms of accumulation of these agents. It is concluded that some 67Ga studies could be replaced by cheaper and more practical [99mTc]GH.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the results of a clinical study that recorded and analyzed sounds emitted from the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during simple function as a means for differentially diagnosing disorders of the joint. The technique is based on the principle that each different disorder of the TMJ produces a different effect on the mechanical relationship between the articulating surfaces of the joint, and that these mechanical effects can be determined by analyzing joint sounds in relation to joint movement. A total of 79 patients (101 joints) were studied; 32 (46 joints) were diagnosed as having extracapsular disorders, (primarily MPD), 27 (32 joints) were diagnosed as having a displaced disc with reduction, nine (10 joints) were diagnosed as having a displaced disc without reduction, and 11 (13 joints) were diagnosed as degenerative disease (osteoarthritis/arthrosis). In addition, 25 adults (50 joints) with normal TMJs were included as controls. The results of this study demonstrated that each specific disease of the TMJ is characterized by a unique relationship between the sounds propagated by the joint and the movement of the joint. Essentially, an extracapsular disease was characterized by acoustic quiescence during natural (as opposed to maximal) jaw movement, an internal derangement by a usually symmetrical short duration click/reciprocal click, or random click complex, depending on the subcategory of the disorder, and a degenerative disease by a long duration noise during either or both jaw opening and closing. The data further suggest that the technique serves to reflect the mechanical events (and abnormalities) that are involved in function of the diseased joint and has potential for use as a clinical diagnostic tool.\r"

We therefore determined the absolute bioavailability of orally and intramuscularly administered methotrexate in 12 pediatric patients receiving 13 to 120 mg/m2 methotrexate every week as maintenance therapy for ALL. Mean bioavailability, as determined by comparing the area under the concentration-time curve after oral or intramuscular administration with that produced by the same dosage given intravenously, was 33% (range 13% to 76%) for oral (n = 11) and 76% (54% to 112%) for intramuscular (n = 7) administration (P less than 0.01). Median bioavailability (with orally administered dosages less than or equal to 40 mg/m2 (range 13 to 40 mg/m2) was 42% (19% to 76%); at dosages greater than 40 mg/m2 (43 to 76 mg/m2), bioavailability was significantly lower, 17.5% (12.7% to 22.3%, p less than 0.02). Conversely, there was no significant relationship between dosage and bioavailability with intramuscularly administered drug. The substantially higher bioavailability for intramuscularly injected methotrexate may warrant its consideration as an alternative to oral administration, especially for dosages greater than 40 mg/m2.\r"

Treatment of the amnion with hyaluronate, heparin, and chondroitin ABC lyase affected the structure of both the epithelium and the extracellular matrix and resulted in a significant increase in tumor cell invasion, but it had no significant effect on the invasion of the parent cell line. These polymers promoted the disorganization of the epithelial cell layer, and their presence resulted both in the matting of collagen fibrils in the stroma and in the loosening of the basement membrane. Pronase treatment removed epithelial cells and stripped collagen fibrils of granules, but it did not promote tumor or parent cell invasion, perhaps as a result of loss of attachment factors. Chondroitin sulfate did not affect the epithelial structure or the rate of tumor invasion and had only slight effects on the structure of the basement membrane and the stroma. These results are consistent with the thesis that the continuity of epithelium is critical to resisting tumor cell invasion and suggest that glycosaminoglycans, in addition to certain enzymes, can alter this integrity.\r"

One difficulty with such studies, especially for rare cancer types, is that unstable local area rate estimates, resulting from small population sizes, can obscure the underlying spatial pattern of disease risk. This paper presents a methodology for producing more stable rate estimates by statistically weighting the local area rate estimate toward the experience at the national level. The methodology is illustrated by the analysis of the spatial variation of two cancer types, bladder and lung, for U.S. white males over the three decades 1950-79.\r"

Short-term employees previously excluded from the cohort have been added, and follow-up has been extended an additional 9 years. The 737 exposed and 2,120 unexposed workers were followed from entry to the end of 1981. Mortality from cancer of the respiratory tract was significantly greater among exposed workers than predicted by local rates [32 observed (Obs); 11.5 expected (Exp); Obs/Exp = 2.79; P less than .01]. When respiratory cancer was examined according to a cumulative index of exposure, there was a clear dose response evident, with risk increased more than tenfold at the highest doses but not increased at the lowest exposure levels. Although some exposures have apparently resulted in a short period from first exposure to development of respiratory cancer, a latent period of 10-19 years appears to be the most common response to exposure. This was true for all doses combined and for each dose category. The majority of employees at risk have passed through the Obs critical latent period for development of chloromethyl ether-related lung cancer. Although the numbers of cases Obs during recent years are still higher than Exp, risk has been declining toward Exp levels.\r"

Diet was measured by means of a comprehensive quantifiable food frequency history instrument in 246 cases and 484 controls drawn from the general population of Utah. Each subject's diet was described by major nutrient groups and total energy based on the nutritional content of foods reported. Cases reported higher daily food intake 5 years preceding diagnosis than controls [men, rate ratio (RR) = 2.5; women, RR = 3.6], as measured by total energy content of the diet. Higher risk of colon cancer with increasing energy intake was independent of stage of disease at diagnosis and obesity, as measured by body mass. Fat, protein, and carbohydrate intake all had elevated RRs but could not be assessed as risk factors independent of energy intake because of their strong correlations with total calories. Due to the higher energy intake of the cases, odds ratios for the daily intake of dietary fiber and vitamins A and C were also greater than 1. However, adjusting for caloric intake removed this effect, and dietary fiber showed a weak protective effect. Total energy intake must be evaluated before attempting to assign a causal role to any food or nutrient that may be postulated to play a role in colon cancer.\r"

The homogenates of three carcinoma cell lines (HeLa, KB, and K-44) contained lower glycylprolyl methylcoumarinamide (Gly-Pro-MCA) hydrolase activities at pH 8.7 (assumed to be DPP IV) and higher activities of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, which are also membrane-bound enzymes, than those of normal human fibroblasts (HF). Examination of carcinoma cells for the subcellular localization and pH optimum of Gly-Pro-MCA hydrolase activity revealed that the activity of a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes Gly-Pro-MCA at pH 6.4 was markedly increased in carcinoma cells, but not in normal cells. The separation and characterization of Gly-Pro-MCA hydrolases by gel filtration, affinity chromatography, and substrate specificity demonstrated that HF have three peaks indicating DPP IV, DPP II, and an unknown enzyme, whereas the three carcinoma cell lines gave a prominent peak indicating DPP II and a trace of DPP IV. The DPP II activity was 6- to 24-fold higher in carcinoma cell lines than in HF, and it also was 2.85- to 4.13-fold higher than the DPP IV activity in carcinoma cell lines but was 10-fold lower in HF. These clear enzymatic differences between carcinoma cells and normal HF may be useful as a marker of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "To identify risk factors for prostate cancer and to try to explain the high risk of blacks relative to whites, case-control interview studies of prostate cancer were conducted in both populations in southern California. Both studies included 142 pairs of cases and population controls matched on age. Cases in blacks were identified by the population-based tumor registry of Los Angeles County and cases in whites were identified by a population-based tumor registry of a southern California retirement community. A past history of venereal disease was associated with a high risk of prostate cancer in both populations [relative risk (RR) = 2.3 in whites; RR = 1.7 in blacks]. The result in blacks was statistically significant (P = .03). Black cases tended to have more frequent sexual intercourse than black controls at all ages; the difference became statistically significant for intercourse late in life. Data from controls suggested that, overall, blacks have earlier and more frequent sexual activity than whites, but the two populations were dissimilar in social class characteristics. Fat intake was a risk factor for prostate cancer in both populations, but vitamin A consumption and protein intake were inconsistently related or unrelated to prostate cancer risk. While beta-carotene was not consistently related to risk, there was some indication that in persons with low fat intake, low beta-carotene intake may be associated with high risk. Circumcision was negatively associated with risk in both populations (RR = 0.5 in whites; RR = 0.6 in blacks). These results are discussed in the context of major etiologic hypotheses for prostate cancer.\r"

Incidence rates for whites of all types combined and of astrocytic glioma and medulloblastoma were slightly higher than those for blacks. Proportionately more black than white cases of astrocytic glioma were diagnosed between the ages of 5-9 years; this difference corresponded to twofold-higher rates at ages of 0-4 and 10-14 years and similar rates at ages of 5-9 years among whites compared to rates among nonwhites. A real difference in age-incidence curves rather than diagnostic delay among blacks appeared to explain the differences. For medulloblastoma, the male-female rate ratio differed between whites (1.7) and blacks (1.0). Time trend analyses revealed statistically significant increases in medulloblastoma and glioma not otherwise specified (NOS) for incidences among blacks. The rate of microscopic confirmation was significantly higher among whites than among blacks, a difference apparently not explained by differences in the accessibility of tumors for biopsy. For avoidance of biased comparisons, differences in rates of microscopic confirmation and time trends for glioma NOS should be considered in studies of racial patterns of childhood brain cancer incidence by histologic type.\r"

Among single white men, this excess risk began after 25-29 years of age. During the 10 years 1973 through 1982, incidence increased among single men under age 45, but little increase in incidence was found for married men. There was a striking increase among single men ages 30-44. These data confirm that single men are more susceptible to non-seminoma testicular cancer than are married men after the age of 30. Testicular cancer is increasing fastest among single men of ages 30-44.\r"

Genetic damage and mutation are believed to play a critical role in chemical carcinogenesis. By incorporating biologic markers of dose or response to carcinogens (such as mutagenicity of body fluids, carcinogen-DNA adducts, chromosomal abnormalities, and somatic cell mutation) into human bio-monitoring or molecular epidemiologic studies, one can detect potential hazards early and increase the power of studies to determine causal relationships. Such markers can also improve extrapolation of risks from experimental animals to humans or from one human population to another. During the past 5 years, there has been considerable progress in developing markers and applying them in human (largely pilot) studies. A review of this experience--with particular emphasis on carcinogen-DNA adducts--affords a better awareness both of the significance of biologic markers and the research needed to fill gaps in understanding. Criteria for marker validation and sound study design are presented that should greatly enhance future research.\r"

  ".W": "A population-based case-control study was conducted in western Washington State to evaluate the relationship between occupational exposure of men aged 20-79 to phenoxyacetic acid herbicides and chlorinated phenols and the risks of developing soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Occupational histories and other data were obtained by personal interviews for 128 STS cases and 576 NHL cases, diagnosed between 1981 and 1984, and for 694 randomly selected controls without cancer. Among the study subjects with any past occupational exposure to phenoxyherbicides, the estimated relative risk and 95% confidence interval of developing STS was 0.80 (0.5-1.2), and of developing NHL, 1.07 (0.8-1.4). Risk estimates of developing STS and NHL associated with past chlorophenol exposure were 0.99 (0.7-1.5) and 0.99 (0.8-1.2), respectively. No increasing risk of either cancer was associated with overall duration or intensity of chemical exposure or with exposure to any specific phenoxyherbicide per se. However, estimated risks of NHL were elevated among men who had been farmers, 1.33 (1.03-1.7), forestry herbicide applicators, 4.80 (1.2-19.4), and for those potentially exposed to phenoxyherbicides in any occupation for 15 years or more during the period prior to 15 years before cancer diagnosis, 1.71 (1.04-2.8). Increased risks of NHL were also observed among those with occupational exposure to organochlorine insecticides, such as DDT [1.82 (1.04-3.2)] and organic solvents [1.35 (1.06-1.7)], and to other chemicals typically encountered in the agricultural, forestry, or wood products industries. These results demonstrate small but significantly increased risks of developing NHL in association with some occupational activities where phenoxyherbicides have been used in combination with other types of chemicals, particularly for prolonged periods. They do not demonstrate a positive association between increased cancer risks and exposure to any specific phenoxyherbicide product alone. Moreover, these findings provide no evidence of increased risks of developing NHL associated with chlorinated phenol exposure or of developing STS associated with exposure to either class of chemical.\r"

The results indicate that mendelian transmission of a single locus is not sufficient to explain the distribution of premenopausal breast cancer seen. A mixed model, i.e., a major locus plus other transmission (genetic and/or cultural), is necessary to explain the distribution. The second analysis added postmenopausal cases of breast cancer to the premenopausal ones, thus considering all breast cancer cases to be affected with the same disorder. The all-cases analysis is unable to reject a mixed model with no generation differences in heritability when tested against the general model, which allows for generation differences (i.e., the likelihoods for the two models were not significantly different). Approaches to studying etiologic heterogeneity in segregation analysis and results of other segregation analyses of breast cancer are presented.\r"

Animals were divided into 6 groups: Group I was treated with MNNG alone (No. = 43); group II was treated with MNNG after application of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor flurbiprofen (No. = 44); group III was treated with MNNG after oral administration of 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 (16,16-dm-PGE2; No. = 43); group IV received flurbiprofen alone (No. = 15); group V was treated with 16,16-dm-PGE2 alone (No. = 11). Animals in group VI served as controls (No. = 15). All drugs were administered orally. Hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of the forestomach developed by 10 days after the first treatment with the carcinogen. Later, benign papillomas and dysplastic lesions were noted. Progressive ingrowth of squamous epithelium from the forestomach ridge into the glandular stomach started as early as day 13 and was more frequent in animals treated with a combination of MNNG plus flurbiprofen (P less than .001). The first squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach were detected on day 51. Their incidence was 38, 60, and 42% in groups I, II, and III, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of mesenchymal tumors (leiomyosarcoma) in the stomach and duodenum was higher following treatment with MNNG plus flurbiprofen as compared to the incidence following treatment with MNNG alone or in combination with 16,16-dm-PGE2 (P less than .005). No malignant tumors developed in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals treated with flurbiprofen or 16,16-dm-PGE2 alone or in controls. The higher incidence of gastric and duodenal leiomyosarcomas after treatment with flurbiprofen suggests that reduction of prostaglandin synthesis favored the development of MNNG-induced cancer in mesenchymal tissues of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\r"

After implantation into the lungs of Osborne-Mendel rats, the condensate from coal-fired residential furnaces, a fraction containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and thiaarenes [sulfur-containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (S-PACs)] with 4-7 rings, as well as fraction containing more polar polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) and PAHs with higher molecular weight, induced lung carcinomas and sarcomas. According to probit analysis, the fraction containing PAHs plus S-PACs with 4-7 rings accounted for about 68.2% of the total carcinogenicity of flue gas condensate, whereas the fraction containing more polar PACs and higher PAHs accounted for about 54.6%. All other fractions, such as nonaromatic compounds and PACs with 2 and 3 rings, constituting about 70% of the weight of the total condensate, seemed not to be carcinogenic. Only 1.4% of the total carcinogenicity of the flue gas condensate was found to be attributable to the amount of benzo[a]pyrene (CAS: 50-32-8) present in the condensate (1.14 mg/g condensate). The contribution of more than 100% of both active fractions to the total carcinogenicity (68.2 and 54.6%) may suggest an interrelation of the fractions.\r"

Male BALB/cByJ mice (n = 260), 5 weeks of age, were fed 20% casein diets containing pyridoxine (PN) at 0.2, 1.2 for the control diet, 7.7, or 74.3 mg/kg diet for 4-11 weeks. After 4 weeks of dietary treatment, 120 of the mice received an injection of H238 cells; mice without H238 injection served as controls. At 4, 8, and 11 weeks, animals from each group were euthanized and blood and spleen samples obtained. Mice fed 0.2 mg PN developed mild deficiency symptoms and gained significantly less weight than those fed 1.2-, 7.7-, and 74.3-mg PN diets. Thirteen to 16 days after tumor cell injection, primary tumor incidence was lowest in mice fed 74.3 mg PN; later, incidence among groups was similar. Mice fed 1.2 mg PN had the largest primary tumor volume, the highest incidence of lung metastases, and the greatest number of metastatic nodules per animal at 7 weeks post injection. Overall, lower tumor volumes were found in animals fed 7.7 and 74.3 mg PN (14 and 32% less than the tumor volume for those fed 1.2 mg PN, respectively); mice fed 0.2 mg PN had the lowest tumor volume. Blood and spleen lymphoproliferative response to stimulation by phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A generally tended to be higher in mice fed 7.7 and 74.3 mg PN as compared to that in animals fed either 0.2 or 1.2 mg PN. However, decreased mitogen-stimulated responsiveness was observed in all animals with progressive tumor growth. Tumor growth also resulted in splenomegaly and increased thymic atrophy. Significant negative relationships between tumor volume and tumor pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) concentrations were observed for 1.2-, 7.7-, and 74.3-mg PN diet groups. These data suggest that high dietary intake of vitamin B6 may have suppressed tumor development by either immune enhancement or PLP growth regulation of this tumor.\r"

  ".W": "KLN 205 murine squamous carcinoma cells were grown in medium supplemented with the retinoid 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) to study the relationship between RA-induced cell surface changes and alterations of the metastatic phenotype. Modulation of the cell surface glycoconjugate expression was measured by flow cytometric analysis of the RA-treated tumor cells stained with fluoresceinated lectins. RA treatment (5 X 10(-6) and 5 X 10(-7) M) altered the glycoconjugate expression of KLN 205 cells in a selective, dose-dependent fashion. Tumor cells grown in RA-supplemented medium for more than 4 days demonstrated greatly increased binding of fluoresceinated Griffonia simplicifolia I lectin, peanut lectin, wheat-germ lectin, concanavalin A, and soybean lectin (P less than .001), but the increased binding of Ulex europaeus lectin was of a much smaller magnitude (P = .02). After 15 days of growth in these noncytotoxic or cytostatic concentrations of RA, malignant KLN 205 cells had a greatly decreased proclivity to metastasize, as measured by the lung colony assay (P = .0003). The RA-induced cell surface glycoconjugate changes preceded the decrease in experimental metastatic potential. Since enzymatic (neuraminidase) alteration of the tumor cell surface to produce glycoconjugate expression similar to that seen in RA-treated cells also reduced the ability of the KLN 205 cells to form lung colonies (P = .0022), it is suggested that RA-induced alteration of the cell surface carbohydrate antigens is related to the decreased experimental metastatic potential seen in tumor cells treated with RA.\r"

The vitamin E was injected into the tumor-bearing buccal pouch twice weekly for 4 weeks in a dose of 250 micrograms in minimum essential medium. Twenty animals were maintained as untreated controls, and another 20 animals were sham-inoculated vehicle controls. Microscopic examination of buccal pouches with regressed tumor showed small epidermoid carcinomas with degeneration of tumor cells and a dense infiltrate of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Buccal pouches of control animals showed large well-differentiated or moderately differentiated epidermoid carcinomas. The hamster buccal pouch cancer model presents many similarities to human oral cancer, including expression of the same oncogene, and these results offer hope for the chemotherapy of human oral cancer with the use of a relatively nontoxic agent injected locally.\r"

Uteri were chosen as controls for the methodology. Experiments were conducted on ovariectomized mice submitted to endocrine manipulation to achieve plasma PRL modifications. In addition to E2, the proliferation of cancer cells, assessed by the measurement of thymidine labeling indices (TLIs), was demonstrated to be enhanced by ovine prolactin (oPRL) and Sulpiride and strongly slowed down by castration and 2-bromo-alpha-ergokryptin treatment, thus emphasizing the great importance of PRL in mammary cancer development. Moreover, a pulse of 1 mg oPRL/animal produced a marked TLI rise in tumors, lasting from the 6th to the 48th hour after its injection and reaching a maximum at 24 hours. PRL had no proliferative effect on the uterine luminal epithelium. When PRL and E2 were injected concomitantly, the profile of stimulation was quite similar to that obtained with E2 alone; i.e., a maximum stimulation was observed at the 24th and 36th hours after hormonal pulse. From these data it is concluded that, in spayed mice, not only E2 but also PRL is of major importance leading to enhanced proliferation of MXT mammary neoplastic cells. Further investigations are needed to throw light on the cellular events presiding over the action of PRL and E2 at the cancer cell level.\r"

By contrast, seronegative symptomless homosexual contacts of AIDS patients (AH-p) lacked this phenotype but were more likely than controls to be homozygous for Gc 2 (25% vs 9%, p less than 0.05). AIDS patients lacked the homozygous Gc 2 phenotype altogether. A chi 2 trend test showed that progression to AIDS had a strong positive association with the Gc 1f allele (p less than 0.0001) and a negative one with Gc 2 (p less than 0.05). It is proposed that Gc may be involved in viral entry into host cells, the ease of which varies with different allelic forms of Gc, according to their sialic acid content.\r"

This virus is related to but distinct from the well-characterized AIDS retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We report here evidence of infection with HIV-2 in 30 patients, almost all from West Africa. Seventeen of them had a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from AIDS (7 of these 17 died). Others had either the AIDS-related complex or no HIV-related symptoms. All patients had serum antibodies reacting with HIV-2 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. All serum tested contained antibodies reacting with the envelope glycoprotein of the virus in an immunoprecipitation assay. Cross-reactivity of serum antibodies with HIV-1 was detected in a minority of patients and varied according to the assay used. Retroviral isolates were obtained from the blood lymphocytes of 11 patients and were all identified as HIV-2 by nucleic acid hybridization; none hybridized with an HIV-1 probe. These findings indicate that some cases of AIDS in West Africa may be caused by HIV-2, but the extent of the spread of this virus and its clinical correlates will require careful epidemiologic investigation.\r"

  ".W": "We studied an 18-year-old woman with progressive hirsutism, secondary amenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian disease. Excess androstenedione was secreted by the ovaries, most likely because of a genetic deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid reductase, the enzyme that converts androstenedione to testosterone. Markedly elevated basal plasma levels of androstenedione, estrone, and testosterone were regulated by gonadotropin but not by ACTH. The rate of androstenedione production in the patient's blood at base line and after administration of dexamethasone was very high (10.0 to 11.6 mg per day; value in control women with hirsutism, less than 4.1 mg per day), whereas her blood production of testosterone was 0.64 to 0.7 mg per day, similar to or higher than that in control women with hirsutism. The fractional blood conversion ratio of androstenedione to testosterone was normal (5.6 percent). Thus, 88 to 93 percent of the testosterone in the blood was derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione, and very little testosterone was secreted by the ovaries. These in vivo biochemical data suggest that the patient had a deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid reductase activity but normal pubertal activity. The patient's two younger sisters with peripubertal symptoms of androgen excess also had elevated serum levels of androstenedione. We propose that the increased secretion of androstenedione in the three siblings in this family was probably due to a genetic deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid reductase.\r"

In the context of an HIV-antibody test that has been documented to be extremely sensitive and specific, standards for truly safe sex can be defined. HIV testing can be used as a powerful tool for defining a series of standards for sexual partners that eliminates, with reasonable certainty, the further spread of HIV. Such standards provide a defined benchmark for future research aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of public health measures in arresting the spread of the virus. The fact that at least 10 million American blood donors and some 2 million Americans applying for or in the armed forces have been tested demonstrates that the adverse consequences of testing can be limited. Now is the time to minimize the fear and eliminate the risk of transmitting HIV to loved ones by urging widespread voluntary testing of sexually active adults and by developing standards for safe sex.\r"

Attempting to circumvent this problem, we have assessed an adjuvant-free antigen-delivery system based on the hypothesis that antigen coupled to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants should be 'targeted' onto antigen-presenting cells, thus facilitating recognition by helper T cells. We found that the biotin-binding protein avidin could generate a serological response in mice, without adjuvant, when injected coupled to a biotinylated anti-class II MHC mAb. Equivalent amounts of avidin mixed with the non-biotinylated form of the same mAb failed to elicit a response. A targeting effect was demonstrated at low levels of injected conjugate because only mice bearing the appropriate class II antigens responded. Responses were also seen with a protein antigen other than avidin, offering a new, adjuvant-free approach to subunit vaccine construction.\r"

Patients who underwent a BSRO with rigid fixation experienced a 3.5 mm decrease in MIO (6.9%). Those who had a BSRO and a LeFort I osteotomy with rigid fixation had a 3.3 mm decrease in MIO (6.6%). In contrast, nonrigidly fixed BSRO subjects had a 16.8 mm decrease (29.6%), while those who underwent a combined BSRO and LeFort I osteotomy had a 13.9 mm decrease (26.1%). This study showed that rigid fixation combined with early function and mild physiotherapy resulted in improved MIO postoperatively, as compared to the MIO in a group in which these treatments were not used.\r"

The mental health of the non-OLP patients was equal to that of the general Finnish population. Of the OLP patients, 48.2% were mentally healthy, 21.4% had a mild mental disturbance, 5.4% had a moderate mental disturbance, and 25.0% had a severe mental disorder. The corresponding figures for the non-OLP patients were 72.7%, 9.1%, 11.4%, and 6.8%. Of the 56 OLP patients, 21 were randomly selected and referred for a psychiatric consultation. Five patients refused the psychiatric interview. Of the sixteen patients who were examined, five had a moderate psychiatric disorder, seven had a mild psychiatric disorder, one had signs of neurosis, and three were mentally healthy. Most of the patients had the subjective feeling that the clinical appearance of OLP, including discomfort, became worse during times of mental stress. None of the patients, however, had a subjective feeling of mental disturbance; nor did any of them feel any need for psychiatric treatment, except in one case.\r"

Fourteen examples of the desmoplastic variant were identified, representing 13% of the intraosseous tumors. The lesions showed distinctive histologic features characterized by an extensive collagenized stroma containing small islands of tumor epithelium with scant tendency to form cystic structures. This histologic variant has a marked tendency to involve the anterior portions of the jaws with 7 of the 14 examples being located in the maxilla. These desmoplastic lesions also showed unusual radiographic findings, often more suggestive of a benign fibro-osseous lesion than of ameloblastoma.\r"

Almost 60% of the lesions occurred in the maxilla, and in both jaws more than 50% occurred in the incisor-cuspid region. The lesion was most common in the second decade. Females were affected more frequently than males; the ratio was 1.7:1. The recurrence rate--16%--was relatively high. Histologically, in 66% of the cases the surface epithelium was ulcerated and in the remainder it was intact. The ulcerated lesions were composed of highly cellular fibroblastic connective tissue, whereas in the nonulcerated lesions part of the tissue was more collagenized. Both types contained mineralized products in the form of bone, cementum-like material, and/or a dystrophic type of calcification. The dystrophic calcification was most prevalent in the ulcerated lesions. The mean duration at time of excision for the ulcerated lesions was 5.6 months and for the nonulcerated lesions was 24 months. It is proposed that the ulcerated and nonulcerated lesions represent a spectrum of one lesion with different stages of maturation.\r"

The initial tissue reaction to SPAD was very mild.

The inflammatory response to Gelfoam was initially greater. However, it decreased with time and the material was removed by the macrophages with subsequent reduction in the size of the surgical gap. The greatest inflammatory reaction was recorded after the use of silver amalgam, with the formation of capsules around the specimens, indicating that the material was extremely irritant before it had set.

A clinical study was conducted to determine the response to this material and to compare it with the response to laterally condensed gutta-percha. SPAD was intentionally forced beyond the apex in some of the patients to evaluate its effect on periapical lesions and on the surrounding tissues. In the majority of patients, the periapical tissues were unable to absorb the excess material, which caused persistent pain and swelling and had to be removed surgically. After removal of the extruded material, which had set into a hard mass with rough surface texture, healing followed a normal course. The use of SPAD and the laterally condensed gutta-percha for filling root canals to their apical constriction provided equally high percentages of success.\r"

We studied a cohort of children whose mothers had been reported to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, comparing human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive with seronegative children as well as a cohort of inner city children with similar socioeconomic characteristics whose mothers are well. Three (12%) of 25 children whose mothers have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were seropositive compared with none of 44 children whose mothers were well. The seropositive children had lower T4A:T8 lymphocyte ratios than children in the other groups. Nine children of affected mothers were young enough to have been born within their mother's incubation period and were seronegative and well. When compared with seronegative children the seropositive children did not have greater contact with their ill mothers, either in types of physical interaction or in length of time lived together.

  ".U": "87204085\r", 
  ".W": "In our model of regulation, the observed lack of cooperativity in the binding of myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) with bound ATP to the troponin-tropomyosin-actin complex (regulated actin) is explained by S-1.ATP having about the same affinity for the conformation of the regulated actin that activates the myosin ATPase activity (turned-on form) and the conformation that does not activate the myosin ATPase activity (turned-off form). This predicts that, in the absence of Ca2+, S-1.ATP should not turn on the regulated actin filament. In the present study, we tested this prediction by using either unmodified S-1 or S-1 chemically modified with N,N'-p-phenylenedimaleimide (pPDM X S-1) so that functionally it acts like S-1.ATP, although it does not hydrolyze ATP. We found that, in the absence of Ca2+, neither S-1.ATP nor pPDM X S-1.ATP significantly turns on the ATPase activity of the regulated complex of actin and S-1 (acto X S-1). In contrast, in the presence of Ca2+, pPDM X S-1.ATP binding almost completely turns on the regulated acto.S-1 ATPase activity. These results can be explained by our original cooperativity model, with pPDM X S-1.ATP binding only approximately equal to 2-fold more strongly to the turned-on form than to the turned-off form of regulated actin. However, our results are not consistent with our alternative model, which predicts that if pPDM X S-1.ATP binds to actin in the absence of Ca2+ but does not turn on the ATPase activity, then it should also not turn on the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+.\r"

To test for gene elements required for induction, a fragment of the alpha-MHC gene containing 2.9 kilobases of 5' flanking sequences and 420 base pairs of DNA 3' to the transcription initiation site was linked to the coding sequences of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The alpha-MHC fusion gene was introduced into primary cultures of fetal rat heart myocytes. Induction of the transfected gene was monitored by assaying CAT activity while endogenous alpha-MHC mRNA expression was measured by using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe complementary to sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA. Without T3, CAT activity was only slightly greater than background. When T3 at a final concentration of 10 nM was added to the cultures, CAT activity was increased 8-fold by 48 hr. The response time and doses of T3 required for induction of CAT activity and alpha-MHC mRNA in transfected cells were similar, suggesting that the synthetic and endogenous genes may have a common mechanism of control. When simian virus 40 enhancer and early promoter sequences were included in the construct, CAT activity was constitutively expressed, but it could be increased 7-fold by the addition of T3. Several deletions were introduced into the 5' flanking sequences of the alpha-MHC fragment and the effects on induction of CAT activity were examined. Progressive deletions of 5' sequences from positions -947 to -374 reduced but did not eliminate induction of CAT activity, suggesting that more than one region may be required for optimal induction by thyroid hormone. The results indicate that DNA sequences required for efficient induction by T3 are present in the 5' flanking sequences of the alpha-MHC gene.\r"

Model building and least-squares refinement led to an agreement factor of 27% for a data set to 3-A resolution prior to any inclusion of solvent molecules. The topology of the molecule is similar to that found in short and long snake neurotoxins, which block the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Major differences occur in the conformation of the central loop, resulting in a change in the concavity of the molecule. Hydrophobic residues are clustered in two distinct areas. The existence of stable dimeric entities in the crystalline state, with the formation of a six-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, may be functionally relevant.\r"

Solution diffraction patterns from G-actin (monomer) and from F-actin (polymer) contain information about the size and shape of actin monomers and the length, width, and subunit organization of filaments. Comparison of patterns collected during polymerization reveals an increase in scatter at spacings greater than 9.0 nm; formation of scattering bands at 5.4,4.9, and 3.4 nm; formation of a scattering minimum at 6.5 nm; and the presence of an isosbestic point at 9.0 nm. These scattering bands arise from the formation of, and organization of subunits in, filaments. At various actin concentrations (0.37-5 mg/ml), the change in scatter in these regions follows simple exponential kinetics with no detectable lag. Our analysis of the x-ray patterns shows that by 0.4 sec after mixing, most of the actin has formed dimers, which then rapidly incorporate into oligomers. At 4 mg/ml the early oligomers increase in length to greater than 30.0 nm within 10 sec. These results suggest that under our conditions actin molecules condense into filaments without the rate-limiting formation of nuclei.\r"

These results suggest that ets-2 gene expression is intrinsically linked with cell proliferation. Thus, ets-2 expression follows a pattern similar to other members of the nuclear oncogene family.

The results presented here show that viral integration in the myb locus generates splicing errors at the 5' and 3' regions. Viral integration results in transcriptional initiation within the viral long terminal repeat and generation of a chimeric mRNA that lacks the first three coding exons. The alterations at the 3' end are caused by an aberrant splicing event in which additional splice-donor and -acceptor sequences within intronic sequences are used to splice an additional 363 nucleotides into the myb transcripts. The resulting insertion of 121 amino acids is in a region of the protein where other activated forms of the myb gene product have deletions. These results suggest that alterations in the 3' end of the myb gene play a crucial role in the activation of this gene.\r"

We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA segment corresponding to the abnormal exon 8-exon 10 junction and the relevant genomic DNA region. The mutation responsible for the disease is a cytosine to thymine transition creating a stop codon at position 697 in exon 9. The original reading frame is maintained in the 7.3-kb mRNA, which, as it lacks the mutated exon, is translatable into a potentially functional protein. This puzzling phenotype in which a mutated exon is apparently removed selectively from transcripts by alternative splicing leads us to suggest that the 7.3-kb transcript could be present in normal animals. Using a sensitive oligonucleotide hybridization assay, we have demonstrated that a 7.3-kb mRNA lacking exon 9 does exist in normal thyroids as a minor mRNA species. As it is fully translatable, the 7.3-kb mRNA is expected to be more stable than the normal-sized 8.4-kb message. This probably accounts for the higher proportion of 7.3-kb transcript found in the goitre.\r"

  ".W": "The fraction DE-B obtained by fractionating an extract from rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells on a DEAE-Sephadex column was used for transcribing linear and supercoiled rRNA gene (rDNA). This fraction, which is known to contain RNA polymerase I and essential transcription factors, also contains DNA topoisomerase I activity. Inhibition of this topoisomerase activity by the selective inhibitor camptothecin markedly diminished transcription of supercoiled rDNA, and at a concentration of 150 microM, camptothecin almost completely inhibited DNA topoisomerase I activity and supercoiled rDNA transcription. Addition of exogenous calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I to the sample containing the drug restored the ability of the extract to transcribe supercoiled rDNA. Camptothecin, even at a concentration of 500 microM, had no significant effect on the transcription of linear rDNA. These studies show that relaxation of supercoiled rDNA by DNA topoisomerase I is essential for its transcription. The preferential inhibition of rRNA synthesis in vivo following treatment with camptothecin is probably due to selective camptothecin inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I activity.\r"

In each of the proteoglycans, this sequence surrounds the serine-glycine dipeptide in which the serine is known or presumed to be substituted with a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain. Peptides containing this sequence from two proteoglycans were examined for their ability to serve as acceptors for xylosyltransferase, the enzyme that begins the assembly of glycosaminoglycan chains. Those peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences known to contain glycosaminoglycan-substituted serine residues in the protein were efficient xylosyltransferase acceptors, whereas peptides from sequences with no glycosaminoglycan-substituted serine residues were not. Amino acid substitutions at four critical sites in the acceptor peptides showed that single substitutions could completely abolish acceptor activity or greatly reduce it. The results suggest that the proteoglycan recognition consensus sequence for the attachment of glycosaminoglycans to core proteins consists of acidic amino acids closely followed by the tetrapeptide Ser-Gly-Xaa-Gly, where Xaa is any amino acid. The signal appears to be contained in the primary sequence information. In this regard it resembles a number of other signals for protein processing and intracellular routing.\r"

The nucleotide sequence shows 90.5% similarity with the human CRBP cDNA sequence. Genomic DNA analysis indicates that CRBP is present in one, or at most two, copies within the rat genome. Analysis of mRNA reveals a single species in every tissue tested and suggests that the isolated cDNA is full-length. Finally, when retinol-deficient rats are fed retinyl acetate for 4 hr, about 4-fold accumulation of CRBP-specific mRNA is observed in the lungs. This rapid effect suggests that the micronutrient retinol may directly influence the expression of its specific intracellular binding protein.\r"

Elevated plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) are correlated with atherosclerosis. Partial amino acid sequence of apo(a) shows that it has striking homology to plasminogen. Plasminogen is a plasma serine protease zymogen that consists of five homologous and tandemly repeated domains called kringles and a trypsin-like protease domain. The amino-terminal sequence obtained for apo(a) is homologous to the beginning of kringle 4 but not the amino terminus of plasminogen. Apo(a) was subjected to limited proteolysis by trypsin or V8 protease, and fragments generated were isolated and sequenced. Sequences obtained from several of these fragments are highly (77-100%) homologous to plasminogen residues 391-421, which reside within kringle 4. Analysis of these internal apo(a) sequences revealed that apo(a) may contain at least two kringle 4-like domains. A sequence obtained from another tryptic fragment also shows homology to the end of kringle 4 and the beginning of kringle 5. Sequence data obtained from two tryptic fragments show homology with the protease domain of plasminogen. One of these sequences is homologous to the sequences surrounding the activation site of plasminogen. Plasminogen is activated by the cleavage of a specific arginine residue by urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator; however, the corresponding site in apo(a) is a serine that would not be cleaved by tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. Using a plasmin-specific assay, no proteolytic activity could be demonstrated for lipoprotein(a) particles. These results suggest that apo(a) contains kringle-like domains and an inactive protease domain.\r"

The method allows the transfer of whole cell or membrane patches in a recording configuration into a pressure vessel, where pressure can be increased up to 60 MPa (approximately equal to 600 bar). We have studied in this way the pressure dependence of single acetylcholine receptor channels in excised \"outside-out\" membrane patches from cultured rat muscle cells. In the range of 0.1 to 60 MPa the open channel conductance in 140 mM NaCl solutions did not vary by more than 2%, which implies that the translocation of sodium ions through the channel pore does not involve steps with significant activation volumes. At high acetylcholine concentrations (20 microM) bursts of single-channel activity allowed measurements of the mean open and mean closed times of the channel. Pressurization to 40 MPa increased both mean open and mean closed times giving apparent activation volumes of about 59 and 139 A3, respectively. This implies a net volume increase of 80 A3, associated with the transition from the agonist-free state to the open state of the channel, which may be partially associated with the agonist-binding step. All the observed pressure effects were reversible. The activation volumes for the gating of acetylcholine receptor channels are comparable to those of sodium and potassium channels in the squid giant axon, suggesting that there is some basic common mechanism in the operation of ion-channel proteins.\r"

After further purification by gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal amino acid sequence for each of the five VLA alpha subunits was determined. In the first 14 positions, the five VLA alpha subunits showed an average of 42% homology to each other, rising to 59% including conservative amino acid substitutions. In addition, the alpha subunits from the LFA-1, Mac-1 (CR-3), and p150,95 family of heterodimers, the vitronectin receptor-platelet GPIIb/IIIa family, and a position-specific (PS) antigen important in Drosophila embryogenesis each showed average homologies of 31-40% to individual VLA alpha sequences and 46-52% homology to VLA alpha subunits including conservative substitutions. Taken together, these results suggest that the VLA proteins, the LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95 family, the GPIIb/IIIa, vitronectin receptor family, and the Drosophila PS antigens have evolved as four subgroups in a highly conserved supergene family of receptors involved in fundamentally important functions, such as cell adhesion, migration, and embryogenesis.\r"

Sera from other animals, including bovines, humans, pigs, goats, and chickens as well as non-serum-containing secretions such as human breast milk and bile also produced this effect. Partial purification utilizing gel filtration and affinity chromatography of the active 33-65% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate of whole serum indicated that the distribution and characteristics of this glycoprotein showed some similarities with those of IgA. Chromatographically purified human IgA was administered to BALB/c mice and was found to induce bile duct proliferation identical to that seen with whole human serum. Purified human IgG and IgM had no activity. Since IgA-containing serum from BALB/c mice was inactive, it appears that heterologous IgA functions as a specific extrahepatic bile duct growth factor (BDGF) in BALB/c mice. Murine susceptibility to the growth-stimulating effect of serum was strain specific; genetic studies utilizing crosses of susceptible (BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/10) strains of mice revealed that the ability to respond to the infusion of BDGF is inherited in a polygenic fashion.\r"

Thus, these IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cells have similar numbers of high-affinity IFN-alpha receptors. IFN-receptor complexes that are insoluble in Triton X-100 accumulate in IFN-sensitive but not in IFN-resistant cells. The ligand-induced accumulation of Triton-insoluble complexes in IFN-sensitive cells was inhibited by cytochalasin B. This suggests that the solubility change of IFN-receptor complexes results from their interaction with the cytoskeletal matrix. The dissociation of IFN-alpha from IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cells can be resolved into fast and slow components. IFN-alpha dissociates more slowly from IFN-sensitive cells than from IFN-resistant cells. Very slow dissociation of IFN-alpha from Triton-insoluble complexes correlates with this difference. These observations suggest that IFN-receptor complexes become coupled to the cytoskeletal matrix in IFN-sensitive but not in IFN-resistant cells, and that such interaction is an important element in the mechanism of the antiproliferative action of IFN-alpha on Daudi cells.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II circulate in blood bound to carrier proteins. The higher molecular mass IGF-binding protein complex (150 kDa) is composed of subunits, and one subunit that forms this complex is growth hormone dependent. In addition, many cell types and tissues secrete another form of IGF binding protein that is not growth hormone dependent. Both forms of the IGF binding protein are believed to inactivate the IGFs and to function as delivery systems to tissues. This conclusion was based on studies that determined the effects of impure preparations of these binding proteins or that examined the effect of these proteins only on the insulin-like actions of the IGFs. We report here that a pure preparation of the extracellular form of the IGF binding protein (purified from human amniotic fluid) markedly potentiated replication of several cell types in response to human IGF-I. Secondary cultures of human, mouse, and chicken embryo fibroblasts as well as porcine aortic smooth muscle cells showed marked enhancement of their DNA synthesis response (2.8- to 4.4-fold increases) to IGF-I in the presence of this protein. These responses were synergistic since the sum of the responses to either IGF-I or to the binding protein alone was between 8 and 17% of the increase obtained in cultures exposed to both peptides. The binding protein not only potentiated the DNA synthesis response but also enhanced the increase in cell number in response to IGF-I. This stimulation is specific for growth factors that bind to the binding protein since incubation with insulin, which binds to the type I IGF receptor but not to the binding protein, did not result in potentiation of this response. We conclude that a form of IGF binding protein that is present in extracellular fluids and is secreted by many types of cells can markedly potentiate the cellular response to IGF-I.\r"

Increased epithelial cell DNA synthesis and proliferation is detectable between 24 and 36 hr after the addition of conditioned medium from Ad5 12S infected cells and not from cells infected with an E1A deletion mutant virus, Ad5 dl312. This mitogenic factor(s) is effective in the absence of serum and can override the inhibitory effect of serum on primary epithelial cells. Furthermore, there is a requirement for the continued presence of the growth factor(s) in the Ad5 12S conditioned medium to maintain epithelial cell proliferation, and the conditioned medium can maintain these cells in a proliferative state for at least 6 wk. The stimulatory activity in Ad5 12S conditioned medium is associated with large molecular weight complexes, from which it can be released by 4 M NaCl. Several characteristics of the growth factor(s) indicate that it is a unique mitogen for epithelial cells.\r"

We found that import depends on ATP hydrolysis within the stroma. Import is not inhibited when H+, K+, Na+, or divalent cation gradients across the chloroplast membranes are dissipated by ionophores, as long as exogenously added ATP is also present during the import reaction. Our data suggest that protein import into the chloroplast stroma requires a chloroplast ATPase that does not function to generate a membrane potential for driving the import reaction but that exerts its effect in another, yet-to-be-determined, mode. We have carried out a preliminary characterization of this ATPase regarding its nucleotide specificity and the effects of various ATPase inhibitors.\r"

We studied tumor cell lines that respond to the cytotoxic action of TNF and resistant variants that bind TNF, normal cell lines that are stimulated to proliferate by TNF and those that are not affected by TNF, and peripheral blood granulocytes whose activation is also augmented by TNF. Using 125I-labeled HurTNF, we found that it bound mainly to four cellular polypeptides (138, 90, 75, and 54 kDa), three of which were found in every cell type examined and one (138 kDa) that was observed only in a human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) that is highly responsive to the cytotoxic action of TNF. The 138-kDa polypeptide was not found in resistant variants of MCF-7 that bind TNF. In contrast to the other polypeptides, the 138-kDa protein was detected 30 min after incubation at 4 degrees C, as compared to 5 min. Scatchard analysis and cross-linking data suggest a model for the TNF receptor structure whereby the receptor is composed of noncovalently linked membrane-bound polypeptides that bind TNF with high affinity (Kd, 0.05-0.8 X 10(-9) M) with the 138-kDa protein being the least abundant and/or even absent in most cells.\r"

These reductions varied from 8% to 31% depending on the agent and the donor cells. The reductions in genomic m5dC levels were concentration dependent for the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene. We speculate that carcinogen-induced perturbation of DNA m5dC patterns may lead to heritable changes in gene expression and contribute to the molecular alterations involved in the initiation and the subsequent steps of the carcinogenesis process.\r"

In the great majority of chimeric eyes, the transplant healed to occupy a small arc-territory at the intended dorsal or anterior position on the host germinal zone. Over the course of subsequent weeks, the transplanted germinal cells added new mitotically quiescent cells to the distal rim of the pigmented retinal epithelium and so gave rise to an elongating black sector on the growing larval eye. Cellular details at the boundaries of the graft-derived sector were stable over time; the accumulation of such landmarks provided a summary record--in the proximodistal axis of the older eye--of the growth history of the transplant. Case-to-case variation among both groups of transplants suggested a measure of indeterminancy in the details of germinal cell growth.\r"

We also conducted behavioral auditory discrimination tests of 144 females of the four species in the laboratory. The results indicate that each chromosomal species has a vocal dialect significantly different from all others, although the call of 2N = 60, the last derivative of speciation, is not yet fully differentiated. Females of 2N = 52, 54, and 58 preferred their homospecific mates' calls, whereas females of 2N = 60 did not. We conclude that call differentiation builds up gradually and provides an efficient ethological reproductive premating isolation mechanism between the emerging species in the active speciation of mole rats in Israel.\r"

The library was screened with the murine repetitive sequence probe pMBA14, which selectively hybridizes with mouse DNA. The mouse-derived cosmid clones thus identified were individually hybridized with DNA from the mouse-Syrian hamster cell line JS17 containing all mouse chromosomes except chromosome 17 on a Syrian hamster background. We deduced that the cosmid clones that contained sequences absent in JS17 were derived from mouse chromosome 17. One of the chromosome 17-derived cosmid clones, 3-4-1 (located proximal to the T122/T66C segment) was found to be highly polymorphic among European wild-mouse populations and may be a useful probe to elucidate the evolution and migration of Mus species. The randomly isolated mouse-derived cosmid clones can also be screened for the presence of functional genes. Using testicular cDNA as a probe, a testis-specific gene was cloned from mouse chromosome 17.\r"

Assuming that one T3 molecule binds to the 49,000-Da unit of the receptor, we reproducibly obtained 6.4-14.7 micrograms of receptor protein with 4.2-4.9% purity from 4-5 kg of rat liver. Elution of receptor from the heparin-Sepharose column was performed using 10 mM pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, which was observed to diminish binding of receptor to heparin-Sepharose or DNA-cellulose. This effect was specific for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, since related compounds were not effective. Purified receptor bound T3 with high affinity (6.0 X 10(9) liter/mol), and the order of affinity of iodothyronine analogues to purified receptor was identical to that observed with crude receptor preparations [3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid greater than L-T3 greater than D-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (D-T3) greater than L-thyroxine greater than D-thyroxine]. Purified receptor had a sedimentation coefficient of 3.4 S, Stokes radius of 34 A, and calculated molecular mass of 49,000. Among several bands identified by silver staining after electrophoresis in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels, one 49,000-Da protein showed photoaffinity labeling with [125I]thyroxine that was displaceable with excess unlabeled T3. The tryptic fragment and endogenous proteinase-digested fragment of the affinity-labeled receptor showed saturable binding in 27,000-Da and 36,000-Da peptides, respectively. These molecular masses are in agreement with estimates from gel filtration and gradient sedimentation, indicating that affinity labeling occurred at the hormone binding domain of nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. This procedure reproducibly provides classical native rat liver T3 nuclear receptor in useful quantity and purity and of the highest specific activity so far reported.\r"

Linkage data between WAS and six marker loci indicate the order of the loci to be (DXYS1-DXS1)-WAS-DXS14-DXS7-(DXS84-OTC).

Results of studies of circulating testosterone levels in wild spotted hyenas do not account for the \"male-like\" characteristics of the female. Androstenedione, however, is consistently higher in females than in males, particularly during early infancy. Experiments on rodents show that androstenedione can be a potent organizer of anatomical and behavioral differentiation.

In both disorders, there is a decreased plasma concentration of apotransferrin. To test the hypothesis that nontransferrin-bound iron exists and is cleared by the parenchymal tissues, the tissue distribution of 59Fe was studied in animals lacking apotransferrin. Two groups of animals were used: normal rats and mice whose transferrin had been saturated by an intravenous injection of nonradiolabeled iron, and mice with congenital hypotransferrinemia. In control animals, injected 59Fe was found primarily in the bone marrow and spleen. In the transferrin iron-saturated animals, injected 59Fe accumulated in the liver and pancreas. Gastrointestinally absorbed iron in hypotransferrinemic or transferrin iron-saturated mice was deposited in the liver. This indicates that newly absorbed iron is released from mucosal cells not bound to transferrin. Clearance studies demonstrated that transferrin-bound 59Fe was removed from the circulation of rats with a half-time of 50 min. In transferrin iron-saturated animals, injected 59Fe was removed with a half-time of less than 30 s. Analysis of the distribution of 59Fe in serum samples by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of 59Fe not bound to transferrin. These results demonstrate the existence of and an uptake system for non-transferrin-bound iron. These observations support the hypothesis that parenchymal iron overload is a consequence of reduced concentrations of apotransferrin.\r"

  ".U": "87204159\r", 
  ".W": "Within the wide spectrum of axonal diameters occurring in mammalian nerve fibers, each class of neurons has a relatively restricted range of axonal calibers. The control of caliber has functional significance because diameter is the principal determinant of conduction velocity in myelinated nerve fibers. Previous observations support the hypothesis that neurofilaments (NF) are major intrinsic determinants of axonal caliber in large myelinated nerve fibers. Following interruption of axons (axotomy) by crushing or cutting a peripheral nerve, caliber is reduced in the proximal axonal stumps, which extend from the cell bodies to the site of axotomy. (The distal axonal stumps, which are disconnected from the cell bodies, degenerate and are replaced by the outgrowth of regenerating axonal sprouts arising from the proximal stump). This reduction in axonal caliber in the proximal stumps is associated with a selective diminution in the amount of NF protein undergoing slow axonal transport in these axons, with a decrease in axonal NF content, and with reduced conduction velocity. The present report demonstrates that changes in axonal caliber after axotomy correlate with a selective alteration in NF gene expression. Hybridization with specific cDNAs was used to measure levels of mRNA encoding the 68-kDa neurofilament protein (NF68), beta-tubulin, and actin in lumbar sensory neurons of rat at various times after crushing the sciatic nerve. Between 4 and 42 days after axotomy by nerve crush, the levels of NF68 mRNA were reduced 2- to 3-fold. At the same times, the levels of tubulin and actin mRNAs were increased several-fold. These findings support the hypothesis that the expression of a single set of neuron-specific genes (encoding NF) directly determines axonal caliber, a feature of neuronal morphology with important consequences for physiology and behavior.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the thymic polypeptide thymopoietin (Tpo) on the properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) were investigated by patch clamp techniques on mouse C2 myotubes and by biochemical assays on AcChoR-rich membrane fragments purified from the Torpedo marmorata electric organ. At high concentrations (greater than 100 nM), Tpo inhibits the binding of cholinergic agonists to the AcChoR in a Ca2+-insensitive manner. At lower concentrations (2 nM), Tpo applied on C2 myotubes simultaneously with nondesensitizing concentrations of acetylcholine results in the appearance of long closed times separating groups of openings. This effect depends on the presence of Ca2+ in the external medium. Outside-out recordings, performed with various concentrations of EGTA in the intracellular medium, suggest that Ca2+ acts on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane after entry through acetylcholine-activated channels. Parallel studies with T. marmorata AcChoR-rich membranes show that in the presence of Ca2+ Tpo causes a decrease in the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of the noncompetitive blocker [3H]phencyclidine, enhances, at low concentrations, the binding of [3H]acetylcholine, and also alters the binding kinetics of the fluorescent agonist 6-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonamido)-n-hexanoic acid beta-(N-trimethylammonium bromide) ethyl ester to the AcChoR. It was concluded that, in the presence of Ca2+, Tpo displaces the conformational equilibrium of the AcChoR towards a high-affinity desensitized state and increases the transition rate towards the same state.\r"

  ".U": "87204162\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in Aplysia biting responses during food arousal are partially mediated by the serotonergic metacerebral cells (MCCs). The MCCs potentiate contractions of a muscle utilized in biting, the accessory radula closer (ARCM), when contractions are elicited by stimulation of either of the two cholinergic motor neurons B15 or B16 that innervate the muscle. We have now shown that ARCM contractions may also be potentiated by peptide cotransmitters in the ARCM motor neurons. We found that motor neuron B15 contains small cardioactive peptides A and B (SCPA and SCPB)--i.e., whole B15 neurons were bioactive on the SCP-sensitive Helix heart, as were reverse-phase HPLC fractions of B15 neurons that eluted like synthetic SCPA and SCPB. Furthermore, [35S]methionine-labeled B15 peptides precisely coeluted with synthetic SCPA and SCPB. SCPB-like immunoreactivity was associated with dense-core vesicles in the soma of B15 and in neuritic varicosities and terminals in the ARCM. B16 motor neurons did not contain SCPA or SCPB but contained an unidentified bioactive peptide. RP-HPLC of [35S]methionine-labeled B16s resulted in one major peak of radioactivity that did not coelute with either SCP and which, when subject to Edman degradation, yielded [35S]methionine in positions where there is no methionine in the SCPs. Exogenously applied B16 peptide potentiated ARCM contractions elicited by stimulation of B15 or B16 neurons. Thus, in this system there appear to be two types of modulation; one type arises from the MCCs and is extrinsic to the motor system, whereas the second type arises from the motor neurons themselves and hence is intrinsic.\r"

By using antibodies prepared against a homogeneous preparation of its catabolic enzyme, quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase [QPRTase; nicotinate-nucleotide:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (carboxylating), EC 2.4.2.19], immunocytochemical methods were applied to assess the cellular and subcellular localization of quinolinic acid in the rat brain. On the light-microscopic level, the enzyme was found to be preferentially associated with glial elements of variable morphology. In addition to its presence in glial cells, QPRTase was contained in tanycytes and ependymal cells of the cerebral ventricles and, sporadically, in neurons. Overall, QPRTase immunoreactivity was noted in every brain region studied, the histological pattern being in good accordance with the regional variation of enzyme activity established in biochemical studies. As judged on the ultrastructural level, QPRTase, in all cell types examined so far, was often noted in densely stained roundish cytoplasmic bodies (0.1-0.8 micron in diameter), which were bounded by a single membrane. In functional terms, these structures may represent early lysosomes, secretory granules, or residual bodies. The particular anatomical arrangement of the quinolinic acid system may reflect the brain's defense strategy against detrimental effects of the endogenous excitotoxin.\r"

  ".U": "87204165\r", 
  ".W": "It is well-established morphologically that bipolar cells, the second-order neurons in the vertebrate retina, make reciprocal synapses with amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer. However, neither the property nor the physiological function of the feedback synapse is understood. Autoradiographic and immunohistochemical studies suggest the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic amacrine cells, and therefore the bipolar cells are thought to receive GABAergic inputs from amacrine cells. This possibility was investigated in the present study, in which we used solitary bipolar cells dissociated from the goldfish retina enzymatically. Dissociated solitary bipolar cells showed a large variety in morphology. In the present study, we selected the bipolar cells with a huge bulbous axon terminal. Bipolar cells of this subtype were identical in morphology to the on-center cells with rod-dominant inputs as revealed in earlier studies by intracellular staining. Membrane currents were measured under voltage clamp with a patch pipette in the whole cell configuration. In some experiments, GABA-sensitive membrane was excised as an outside-out patch from the axon terminal bulb of solitary bipolar cells. All cells of this type responded to GABA. The highest sensitivity was located at the axon terminal. The minimal effective dose was on the order of 10(-7) M. GABA increased the chloride conductance and evoked a membrane hyperpolarization. Partial desensitization was observed during the application of GABA. The bipolar cells had GABA type A receptors. These results are consistent with the idea that the rod-dominant on-center bipolar cells receive negative feedback inputs from GABAergic amacrine cells.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis has revealed the primary structure of a 170-amino acid precursor protein that encodes both neurotensin and the neurotensin-like peptide neuromedin N. The peptide-coding domains are located in tandem near the carboxyl terminus of the precursor and are bounded and separated by the paired, basic amino acid residues Lys-Arg. An additional coding domain, resembling neuromedin N, occurs immediately after an Arg-Arg basic amino acid pair located in the central region of the precursor. Additional amino acid homologies suggest that tandem duplications have contributed to the structure of the gene. RNA blot analysis, using the cloned cDNA probe, has revealed several mRNA species ranging in size from 500 to 980 nucleotides in the canine enteric mucosa. In contrast, a single RNA species of 1500 nucleotides was detected in bovine hypothalamus poly(A)+ RNA. The ability of the canine probe to cross-hybridize with bovine mRNA suggests that this probe can be used to isolate neurotensin/neuromedin N genes from other mammalian species.\r"

In particular, with copper(I) they form, respectively, a dinuclear and a trinuclear complex containing two ligand molecules and two or three Cu(I) ions. In view of the pseudotetrahedral coordination geometry of Cu(I) X bis(bipyridine) sites and of NMR data indicating that the present complexes are chiral, one may assign to these dinuclear and trinuclear species a double-helical structure in which two molecular strands are wrapped around two or three Cu(I) ions, which hold them together. These complexes may thus be termed \"double-stranded helicates.\" Determination of the crystal structure of the trinuclear species has confirmed that it is indeed an inorganic double helix, possessing characteristic features (helical parameters, stacking of bipyridine bases) reminiscent of the DNA double helix. This spontaneous formation of an organized structure by oligobipyridine ligands and suitable metal ions opens ways to the design and study of self-assembling systems presenting cooperativity and regulation features. Various further developments may be envisaged along organic, inorganic, and biochemical lines.\r"

From a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we have isolated a gamma-actin cDNA clone with amino acid substitutions in a region highly conserved in the many actins analyzed. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a variant gamma-actin in a human neoplasm. A separate finding from the analysis of this clone is that the gamma-actin 3'-untranslated region is among the most highly conserved of all 3'-untranslated sequences so far reported, but is entirely different from the beta-actin 3'-untranslated region. The high degree of evolutionary conservation suggests that the 3'-untranslated regions of these two mRNAs have important and distinct functional roles that were already fully differentiated more than 100 million years ago. Mutations affecting four major cytoskeletal components have now been identified in human neoplastic cells. These findings suggest that mutated cytoskeletal genes may be members of a class of oncogenes, fundamentally different from both the nuclear-acting (e.g., myc and simian virus 40 large tumor antigen) and growth factor/receptor/protein kinase-related (e.g., sis, erbB, and ras) types of oncogenes.\r"

Variations are large for active-site regions, the segment around the second zinc atom, and for segments involved in subunit interactions. The two classes of alcohol dehydrogenase have diverged to exhibit structural differences to about half the extent of those between alcohol and polyol dehydrogenases. Hence, the two classes of alcohol dehydrogenase represent steps in enzyme rather than isozyme divergence. An evolutionary scheme that relates different types of zinc-containing mammalian dehydrogenases to one another encompasses at least three levels of gene duplication subsequent to the early step(s) of assembly of building unit(s). The first level of duplication results in the formation of now clearly different enzymes. The second level concerns the various classes of alcohol dehydrogenase, forming steps between typical enzymes and isozymes. The third level encompasses recent and multiple duplications in isozyme evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases. This scheme, linking zinc-containing dehydrogenases at different levels, resembles that in other protein families and reflects general patterns in protein relationships.\r"

During the time required for glycogen depletion (3 hr), stimulation of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was initiated and observed to reach a maximum enhancement of 200% 12-15 hr later. The monokine had no effect on the Km value for 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake (1.1 mM), while Vmax was increased from 912 to 2400 pmol/min per mg of protein. The increase was cytochalasin B inhibitable and was dependent on protein synthesis. Photoaffinity labeling and equilibrium binding studies with [3H]cytochalasin B support the hypothesis that this increase in hexose transport was due to an increase in hexose transporters present in the plasma membrane. Purified recombinant interleukin-1 alpha had no effect on hexose transport, whereas purified recombinant cachetin/tumor necrosis factor did stimulate hexose uptake, with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 36 nM. Although cachetin accounts for most of the biological activity associated with the crude monokine preparations, it is not the only monokine capable of inducing glucose transport in L6 cells. Specific immunoabsorption of cachectin/tumor necrosis factor from the crude monokine preparation revealed a monokine that had a similar bioactivity at extremely low concentrations on L6 cells.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that cellular protein carboxyl-methylation reactions recognize altered aspartyl residues as part of a protein repair pathway has been tested in an in vitro system using tetragastrin (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) as a model sequence. The L-isoaspartyl form of tetragastrin, where the phenylalanine residue is linked to the side-chain carboxyl group of the aspartate residue ([iso-Asp3]tetragastrin), is a substrate for the erythrocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferases, while the normal form is not. The enzymatically produced alpha-methyl ester of [iso-Asp3]tetragastrin, [iso-Asp(OMe)3]tetragastrin, is unstable at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C and spontaneously demethylates with a half-time of 41 min to an intermediate L-succinimide form ([Asu3]tetragastrin) that, in turn, spontaneously hydrolyzes with a half time of 116 min to give a mixture of normal tetragastrin (20%) and [iso-Asp3]tetragastrin (80%). This sequence of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions can be coupled in a single reaction mixture; the [iso-Asp3]tetragastrin that is produced upon succinimide hydrolysis can reenter the reaction sequence by enzymatic methylation, and the net result of the process is the conversion of the isomerized peptide to the normal peptide. The efficiency of this \"repair\" reaction is limited by a side reaction of racemization at the alpha-carbon of the succinimide (half-time = 580 min). In a 24-hr time period, normal L-aspartyl-containing tetragastrin is obtained in about 50% yield from the coupled reaction mixture; other products include [D-iso-Asp3]tetragastrin and [D-Asp3]tetragastrin. The versatile chemistry of succinimide peptides suggests that methylated L-isoaspartyl sites (and possibly methylated D-aspartyl sites) in cellular polypeptides can eventually yield \"repaired\" normal L-aspartyl sites through succinimide intermediates.\r"

We have found that the 24-homo- and 26-homo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and their delta 22 analogues are 10-fold more potent than 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells in vitro. In vivo, these analogues show activity similar to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in stimulating intestinal calcium transport in vitamin D-deficient rats. The 24-homoanalogues are significantly less active, whereas the 26-homo derivatives are more active than the natural hormone in mobilizing calcium from bone. This unusual activity pattern cannot be explained on the basis of the affinity of these analogues for the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 intracellular receptor: both 24-homo- and 26-homo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 have the same effectiveness as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in displacing the tritiated hormone from its receptor in rat intestine or HL-60 cells.

Our results strongly suggest that BC1 RNA is transcribed specifically from the BC1 gene(s) and is not a highly heterogeneous population of ID-containing RNA polymerase III transcripts. Moreover, the availability of a unique BC1 RNA sequence will facilitate studies on tissue- and stage-specific gene regulation and will help in clarifying the role of this small RNA in the brain.\r"

Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the intestinal mucosa was injected into oocytes, and the expression of the transporter in the oocyte plasma membrane was assayed by measuring the Na-dependent phlorizin-sensitive uptake of methyl alpha-D-[14C]glucopyranoside (MeGlc). Expression of the glucose carrier was detected 3-7 days after mRNA injection, and the rate of glucose transport was proportional to the amount of mRNA injected. mRNA (50 ng) increased the maximum velocity (Vmax) of MeGlc uptake by as much as 10-fold over background. The total mRNA was fractionated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis and each fraction was assayed for its ability to induce transport activity. The mRNA encoding the Na/glucose cotransporter was found in a single fraction of approximately 2.3 kilobases (kb), which contained 3% of the total mRNA. A similar mRNA fraction (2.0-2.6 kb) isolated from colon did not induce expression of this transporter. In vitro translation of the fractionated intestinal mRNA showed enhanced synthesis of two protein bands at 57 and 63 kDa. The mRNA encoding the cotransporter is smaller (2.3 kb) than that (2.6-2.9 kb) encoding the 55-kDa facilitated glucose carrier in human hepatoma cells and rat brain.\r"

The amount of this suppressor glutamine tRNA in mouse liver was 1-2% of the amount of the major glutamine tRNA(tRNA(CUGGln)) that has the CUG anticodon sequence, but it was markedly increased in NIH 3T3 cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus and in Ehrlich ascites cells.

Inspection of the sequence of intron D reveals an open reading frame through the entire intron, with a termination codon encountered 50 nucleotides into the fifth exon, which is shifted from the normal reading frame in this variant mRNA. If translated, this variant mRNA would encode a growth hormone-related polypeptide having 125 amino-terminal amino acids identical to wild-type growth hormone, followed by 108 carboxyl-terminal amino acids encoded by the 274 bases of intron D along with the first 50 nucleotides of exon 5. This variant polypeptide would be 42 amino acids longer than wild-type bovine growth hormone or approximately 5000 greater in molecular weight. The intron D-containing variant of bovine growth hormone mRNA was demonstrated to exist on polysomes, suggesting that this mRNA species is translated into a polypeptide.

Nearly complete conservation of the noncoding sequences was found. Nine nucleotides at the 3' termini and 11 nucleotides at the 5' termini were common to all segments examined. In the region immediately adjacent to the common 3' terminal region, the nucleotides were specific for each segment and these segment-specific sequences were conserved in all strains examined. In each of the five segments in which both termini were examined, the segment-specific 3' sequences exhibited perfect inverted complementarity to a segment-specific sequence adjacent to the common 5' terminus. In addition, in the 3' noncoding region of RNA segments 1-3, which encode proteins involved in RNA synthesis, a single nucleotide substitution at position 10 was found that distinguishes these segments from segments 4-8. Comparison of these data with published reports has revealed that some of the features found in the noncoding regions of influenza B virus are also present in influenza A and C virus RNAs. In the RNAs of all three virus types, there is a segment-specific sequence of nucleotides near the 3' terminus that shows inverted complementarity to a sequence near the 5' terminus. This segment-specific sequence may play a role in the transcription of individual segments or in sorting of segments during virion assembly.\r"

  ".W": "A model for formal neural networks that learn temporal sequences by selection is proposed on the basis of observations on the acquisition of song by birds, on sequence-detecting neurons, and on allosteric receptors. The model relies on hypothetical elementary devices made up of three neurons, the synaptic triads, which yield short-term modification of synaptic efficacy through heterosynaptic interactions, and on a local Hebbian learning rule. The functional units postulated are mutually inhibiting clusters of synergic neurons and bundles of synapses. Networks formalized on this basis display capacities for passive recognition and for production of temporal sequences that may include repetitions. Introduction of the learning rule leads to the differentiation of sequence-detecting neurons and to the stabilization of ongoing temporal sequences. A network architecture composed of three layers of neuronal clusters is shown to exhibit active recognition and learning of time sequences by selection: the network spontaneously produces prerepresentations that are selected according to their resonance with the input percepts. Predictions of the model are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "High-affinity potassium uptake in Neurospora occurs by symport with protons [Km (apparent) = 15 microM at pH 5.8], for which a large inward gradient (approximately 400 mV) is generated by the H+-extruding ATPase of the plasma membrane. Operating in parallel, the two transport systems yield a net 1:1 exchange of K+ for cytoplasmic H+. Since this exchange could play a role in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) regulation, the coordinated functioning of the K+-H+ symport and H+ pump has been examined during acid stress. Cytoplasmic acid loads were imposed by injection and by exposure to extracellular permeant weak acid. Multibarrelled microelectrodes were used to monitor membrane potential (Vm), pHi, and the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the cells. The behaviors of the H+ pump and K+-H+ symport were resolved, respectively, by fitting whole membrane I-V curves to an explicit kinetic model of the Neurospora membrane and by subtracting I-V curves obtained in the absence from those obtained in the presence of 5-200 microM K+ outside. Proton pumping accelerates nearly in proportion with the cytoplasmic H+ concentration, but pHi recovery from imposed acid loads is dependent on micromolar K+ outside. Potassium import via the symport leads to a measurable alkalinization of the cytoplasm in accordance with stoichiometric (1:1) K+/H+ exchange. Potassium transport is accelerated at low pHi, but in a manner consistent with its inherent voltage sensitivity and changes in Vm resulting from an increased rate of H+ extrusion by the pump. The primary response to acid stress thus rests with the H+ pump, but K+ transport introduces an essential kinetic \"valve\" that can regulate net H+ export.\r"

It was possible to distinguish the principal tissues of the stem by differences in their proton density or apparent water content and spin lattice relaxation time (T1) or degree of water binding. Measurements were made while the plant was slowly and actively transpiring. In the slowly transpiring plant, T1 of various tissues ranged from an average of 659 to 865 ms with a proton density variation of from 72 to 100%. In the actively transpiring plant, T1 ranged from an average of 511 to 736 ms, and the proton density was reduced, ranging between 62 and 88% of the peak value found in the slowly transpiring plant. The fibrous sheath surrounding the vascular tissue and the epidermal region was found to have the highest spin density and T1. Both tissues are comprised of relatively small thick-walled cells. Cortical and pith parenchyma are composed of larger, thinner-walled cells with numerous intercellular spaces and lower spin density and T1. The differences are attributed to the higher water content by volume in the tissue composed of smaller, more compactly arranged cells. The resolution obtained in this work enables clear definition of tissues in the living plant and quantitative information concerning differences in the distribution and extent of binding of water.\r"

The adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin, isolated from normal chicken fibroblast extracellular matrix, underwent limited but specific cleavage by PA in the absence of plasminogen. Analysis of the cleavage products by polyacrylamide gels under both reducing and nonreducing conditions indicated that PA-mediated cleavage occurred near the carboxyl terminus of fibronectin but on the amino-terminal side of the interchain disulfide bridge, thus disrupting the native dimeric fibronectin molecule. Under the identical conditions, chicken ovalbumin was not cleaved while the established substrate, chicken plasminogen, was extensively converted to plasmin. A monoclonal antibody, directed against avian PA and shown to inhibit plasminogen-free, cell-mediated matrix degradation, specifically inhibited the fibronectin cleavage. A human PA, urokinase, also cleaved fibronectin under plasminogen-free conditions yielding a limited number of high molecular weight cleavage products.\r"

This was achieved by exposing the CEE cells to a semicontinuous dose of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) for a period of 20 hr. Southern blot analysis indicated that an average of one proviral copy is integrated per embryonic cell. However, there was no production of infectious viral particles by the cells containing the proviral genome, although low levels of full-length genomic RNA could be detected by RNA transfer blot analysis. These low RNA levels contrast with the 100- to 1000-fold higher levels found in RSV-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts. We conclude that in cells derived from pregastrulating chicken embryos, RSV DNA is integrated into the cell genome but fails to be expressed in an efficient manner. These primary cells can therefore be used to identify factors involved in regulation of retroviral gene expression in normal cells. Such factors may also be instrumental in elucidating basic mechanisms involved in gene regulation during early development in higher vertebrates.\r"

With continuous white light, CAT-2 protein levels increase (due to de novo synthesis) and plateau after 24 hr. When total poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA), polysomes, or isolated polysomal mRNA from light- and dark-treated leaves was translated in vitro, CAT-2 was detected only among the light-treated leaf products. A Cat2 clone was used to probe blots of total mRNA and polysomal mRNA from light- and dark-treated leaves. Cat2 mRNA was found in approximately equal quantities in both. Cat2 mRNA was equally distributed in identical high molecular weight fractions in polysomes from light- and dark-treated leaves and, therefore, was probably not sequestered in ribonucleoprotein particles in dark-grown leaves. The control of Cat2 expression appears to involve a unique form of translational inhibition in dark-grown leaves, preventing translation of the isolated mRNA and preventing polypeptide elongation. These results may have important implication in studies of translational control in other systems.\r"

The response to exogenous ethylene is rapid; within 30-120 min we detect an increase in the cloned mRNA concentrations. DNA sequence analysis indicates that one of the ethylene-inducible genes is related to a gene encoding wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor I. We have measured ethylene production during fruit development and detect low basal levels in unripe fruit and much higher levels in ripening fruit. Blot hybridization experiments show that expression of the cloned genes is developmentally regulated by ethylene during fruit ripening: the mRNAs produced by these genes are more abundant in ripe fruit than in unripe fruit, and this mRNA accumulation is repressed by a competitive inhibitor of ethylene action, norbornadiene. However, during fruit development some of the cloned mRNAs begin to accumulate when ethylene production is at a basal level, whereas other mRNAs begin to accumulate later when the endogenous ethylene concentration increases, suggesting that gene expression during fruit development can be activated by ethylene in two ways. In some cases gene expression is primarily activated by an increase in sensitivity to basal ethylene levels, whereas in other cases it may be regulated by an increase in ethylene concentration.\r"

It appears on cell surfaces as a glycoprotein of Mr 124,000 but is synthesized as a precursor of Mr 135,000. We have isolated and determined the nucleic acid sequence of a cDNA clone (lambda L320) encoding chicken L-CAM. The 5' end of this clone has an open reading frame extending for 2520 base pairs, followed by an 850-base-pair untranslated region terminating with a polyadenylylation site at its 3' end. Protein sequence analysis of intact L-CAM and of cyanogen bromide fragments of the protein confirmed the reading frame and indicated that lambda L320 encodes the complete sequence of L-CAM as it is expressed on the cell surface as well as the bulk of the precursor. The sequence includes a hydrophobic segment of 31 amino acids, supporting our earlier conclusion that L-CAM is an intrinsic membrane protein. There are five potential asparagine glycosylation sites on the extracellular part of the molecule and an intracellular domain that is phosphorylated in vivo. The mature L-CAM polypeptide consists of 727 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 79,900 for the carbohydrate-free protein. The L-CAM sequence is not homologous to other known protein sequences, including those of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, but the L-CAM molecule does contain three contiguous segments (113 amino acids each) that are homologous to each other. The similarities among these segments suggest that at least part of the L-CAM molecule arose by gene duplication.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the amino acid sequences of proteins that are involved in acetylcholine (AcCho) metabolism and cholinergic neurotransmission: choline acetyltransferase (ChoAcTase), acetylcholinesterase (AcChoEase), and a neuronal alpha subunit of nicotinic AcCho receptor (AcChoR). A comparison of Drosophila ChoAcTase and rat neuronal alpha subunit of AcChoR shows a limited segmental type homology, which may suggest a similar acetylcholine binding site in the two proteins evolving by convergence. We note a global homology of 21-44% identity between Drosophila ChoAcTase and Torpedo AcChoEase. Six homologous segments of 40-60 amino acids cover 38% and 54% of the sequences, raising the possibility of a common evolutionary origin. We also note that mammalian thyroglobulin (TG), the precursor for thyroid hormones, contains an AcChoEase-like sequence at its carboxyl end. This homology raises the possibility that the gene for TG has evolved by gene fusion or condensation (i.e., recruiting a preexisting redundant copy of a gene for AcChoEase during vertebrate evolution). Our results demonstrate that the record of evolutionary history for nervous system proteins can be read across the boundaries of separation between vertebrates and invertebrates. They also provide molecular evidence for the common evolutionary origins of the nervous and endocrine systems in vertebrates--both evolving to make intercellular communication possible.\r"

One of the PhoA+ mutants isolated showed a dramatic reduction in its ability to colonize the intestines of suckling mice. This mutant no longer produced a 20.5-kDa protein (TcpA) that we show is the major subunit of a V. cholerae pilus. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the TcpA pilus subunit showed that it shares amino acid homology with the pilins produced by several other pathogenic bacteria. The TcpA pilus was coordinately expressed with cholera toxin under various culture conditions, and this effect appeared to be dependent on the transcriptional activator encoded by the toxR gene. We conclude that the toxR gene plays a central role in the transcriptional regulation of multiple virulence genes of V. cholerae.\r"

These clones were isolated from a lambda gt11 mouse muscle cDNA library via screening with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a portion of the rabbit gamma-Phk amino acid sequence. The gamma-Phk cDNA clones code for a 387-amino acid protein that shares 93% amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding rabbit amino acid sequence. RNA gel blot analysis reveals that the muscle gamma-Phk probe hybridizes to two mRNA species (2.4 and 1.6 kilobases) in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain, but does not hybridize to liver RNA. Phk-deficient I-strain (Phk) mouse muscle contains reduced levels of gamma-Phk mRNA as compared with control mice. Although the Phk defect is an X-linked recessive trait, hybridization to a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel shows that the gamma-Phk gene is not located on the X chromosome. Rather, the gamma-Phk cross-hybridizing human restriction fragments map to human chromosomes 7 (multiple) and 11 (single). Reduced gamma-Phk mRNA in I-strain mice, therefore, appears to be a consequence of the Phk-mutant trait and does not stem from a mutant gamma-subunit gene.\r"

In this report we describe a chimeric gene construct containing a T-cell receptor alpha-chain variable (V) domain and the constant (C) region coding sequences of an immunoglobulin gamma 2a molecule. Cells transfected with the chimeric gene synthesize a stable protein product that expresses immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor antigenic determinants as well as protein A binding sites. We show that the determinant recognized by the anticlonotypic antibody A2B4.2 resides on the V alpha domain of the T-cell receptor. The chimeric protein associates with a normal lambda light chain to form an apparently normal tetrameric (H2L2, where H = heavy and L = light) immunoglobulin molecule that is secreted. Also of potential significance is the fact that a T-cell receptor V beta gene in the same construct is neither assembled nor secreted with the lambda light chain, and when expressed with a C kappa region it does not assemble with the chimeric V alpha C gamma 2a protein mentioned above. This indicates that not all T-cell receptor V regions are similar enough to immunoglobulin V regions for them to be completely interchangeable.\r"

Using HPLC and immunoblot analysis, we have identified from a clone B, type III human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-IIIB) extract a protein with a molecular weight of 17,000 that is immunoreactive with thymosin alpha 1. In contrast, no immunoreactivity was found in retroviral extracts from a number of nonhuman species including feline, bovine, simian, gibbon, and murine retroviruses. Heterologous antiserum prepared against a 30-amino acid synthetic peptide analogue (HGP-30) does not cross-react with thymosin alpha 1 but does react specifically with the p17 protein of the AIDS virus in a manner identical to that seen with an HTLV-IIIB p17-specific monoclonal antibody. The demonstration that this synthetic analogue is immunogenic and that antibodies to HGP-30 cross-react not only with the synthetic peptide but also with the HTLV-IIIB p17 viral protein provides an additional, and potentially more specific, candidate for development of a synthetic peptide vaccine for AIDS. In addition, the p17 synthetic peptide (HGP-30) may prove to be useful in a diagnostic assay for the detection of AIDS virus infection in seronegative individuals.\r"

Five other SLE patients were consecutively studied in active and remission states. Antibodies against the protein were detected in the serum of the 5 SLE patients when they were in active phase but not in the serum of the same patients in inactive phase of the disease. The anti-protein antibodies were not found in the serum of 10 inactive SLE patients or in the sera of 10 normal human controls, 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 5 patients with scleroderma, and 4 patients with primary sicca syndrome. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that antibodies against this cell-surface protein could provide a better diagnosis marker and activity index than anti-DNA antibodies in SLE.\r"

The present studies show that this oxidized LDL does not inhibit the motility of mouse monocytes and actually exhibits a chemotactic activity for human monocytes; the chemotactic activity of the oxidized LDL resides in the lipid fraction. These findings allow us to propose a pathogenetic sequence by which elevated plasma LDL levels, followed by oxidative modification in the arterial wall, could sufficiently account for the generation of the lipid-laden foam cells and the initiation of the fatty streak, the earliest well-defined lesion in atherogenesis.\r"

The dye was also shown to be a potent sensitizer of lipid peroxidation in a natural cell membrane, the erythrocyte ghost. Inhibition by azide, stimulation by 2H2O, and identification of the cholesterol product 5 alpha-cholest-6-ene-3 beta,5-diol in this system, all were consistent with singlet oxygen intermediacy. Finally, MC 540 was found to be considerably more phototoxic to K-562 leukemia cells in 2H2O than in H2O.

We previously have isolated an overlapping set of cDNA clones for the human MDR1 gene from multidrug-resistant KB cells. Here we report the construction of a full-length cDNA for the human MDR1 gene and show that this reconstructed cDNA, when inserted into a retroviral expression vector containing the long terminal repeats of Moloney leukemia virus or Harvey sarcoma virus, functions in mouse NIH 3T3 and human KB cells to confer the complete multidrug-resistance phenotype. These results suggest that the human MDR1 gene may be used as a positive selectable marker to introduce genes into human cells and to transform human cells to multidrug resistance without introducing nonhuman antigens.\r"

The rate constants describing 36Cl- efflux did not differ between the two cell types, but in each of the four pairs tested the amount of 36Cl- contained within CF cells was consistently reduced, by 25-30%, relative to normal cells. Comparisons of cell water content and 22Na+ efflux showed no differences between the two cell types, suggesting that overall intracellular chloride concentration is lower than normal in CF fibroblasts. Such data suggest that the CF gene defect is expressed in skin fibroblasts and that this defect may alter the regulation of intracellular Cl- concentration, perhaps through changes in Cl- permeability.\r"

Whereas the neural lobe contained only the bioactive alpha-carboxyamidated cholecystokinin (CCK) peptides (32 pmol/g), of which CCK-8 predominated, the anterior lobe contained substantial amounts of three large nonamidated procholecystokinin fragments (95 pmol/g; Mrs, 9000, 7000, and 5000) and small amounts of alpha-amidated CCK (8.3 pmol/g). The latter occurred only in the following large molecular forms: component I, CCK-58, and traces of CCK-33. Corticotrophic tumors processed the large forms to small CCK-8-like forms as are found in the brain and in the gut. The results show that a hormone gene, although translated, is expressed only to a limited extent as mature, active peptide outside the principal production region(s). Thus the processing of CCK to small alpha-amidated peptides in the less-differentiated tumor tissue supports the hypothesis that differentiation of endocrine cells may be sustained also at the posttranslational level.\r"

E. histolytica actin-encoding cDNAs and genomic clones have been isolated from libraries prepared from the virulent HM1:IMSS strain using a heterologous actin probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis of three independent cDNA clones and one genomic clone reveals a highly unusual codon bias and the absence of intervening sequences in E. histolytica actin. The coding sequence of the genomic clone is identical to that of two of the three cDNA clones. These represent at least two distinct mRNAs differing only by five silent changes in the protein coding sequence. Multiple genomic copies of the actin gene can be detected by Southern hybridization. E. histolytica actin exhibits a higher degree of homology to cytoplasmic than to muscle actin. Although the protein has been shown not to bind DNase I, the inferred amino acid sequence indicates conservation of all residues implied to participate in this binding.\r"

Analyses of plasma MBP levels during pregnancy showed a striking correlation between increases late in the third trimester and spontaneous onset of labor. In one case with premature labor, the plasma MBP level also was increased coincidentally with labor. In contrast, in cases of prolonged gestation in which labor was induced, there were no late increases in MBP levels. Also, uterine contraction during spontaneous labor or oxytocin-induced labor did not cause elevations of plasma MBP. Measurement of plasma MBP levels in pregnancy may be useful for the prediction of labor and for the development of new means of intervention for premature labor and prolonged gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The use of cloning vectors that express inserted cDNA as fusion protein has led to the isolation of genes encoding a variety of eukaryotic proteins. In these instances antisera or monoclonal antibodies were used as probes to screen expression libraries. Since fusion proteins sometimes display biological activity reflective of the insert-specified portion, we tested the possibility that ligand-binding sites might exist in fusion proteins. Specifically we used 125I-labeled calmodulin as a probe to screen a mouse brain lambda gt11 library. One clone, lambda ICM-1 isolated using this approach, produces fusion protein that binds calmodulin with high affinity (Kd, 3-10 nM) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Molecular genetic mapping experiments and deduction of the predicted higher-order structure from sequence data indicate the binding site is, or is within, a basic, amphiphilic alpha-helical domain composed of approximately 20 amino acids. lambda ICM-1 hybridizes with brain mRNA of 2.1 and 3.5 kb but not with mRNA from liver or kidney, suggesting possible restriction of the protein to brain. We discuss several observations that suggest lambda ICM-1 corresponds to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, an enzyme that phosphorylates several neuronal proteins, some of which apparently play a role in synaptic function. Our results suggest certain types of ligands may be useful probes to isolate genes encoding various receptor proteins, particularly when the protein is very rare or when it is difficult to obtain antibodies suitable for screening libraries.\r"

  ".U": "87204265\r", 
  ".W": "This study presents, to our knowledge, the first on-line measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AcChoEase) release from brain tissue. It is now well established that a soluble form of the enzyme is released from central nervous system neurons, and it has been proposed on indirect grounds that such release may occur not only from presynaptic terminals but also from the dendrites of dopamine-containing nigrostriatal neurons. We have used a chemiluminescent reaction to examine the real-time release of AcChoEase from the substantia nigra in vitro in brainstem slices. The light emission was captured by two fiber optic systems, one in direct contact with the brain slice from below and the second 4-mm above the slice, allowing simultaneous imaging of the emitted light and quantitative photometry. It was determined that the light signals are not due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of acetylcholine or the presence of free choline, but are caused by the enzymatic action of AcChoEase. Using this technique, it can be directly shown that AcChoEase is spontaneously released from the soma or dendrites of nigral neurons. The release of the enzyme, which is stored in the subcisternal dendritic compartment, is resistant to blockade of voltage-dependent sodium conductances, is calcium dependent, and can be increased by addition of potassium to the bathing solution. The procedure we describe here will make it possible to study the release of endogenous AcChoEase on a time-scale close to that over which it functions.\r"

  ".U": "87204266\r", 
  ".W": "The anticonvulsants phenytoin and carbamazepine interact allosterically with the batrachotoxin binding site of sodium channels. In the present study, we demonstrate an autoradiographic technique to localize the batrachotoxin binding site on sodium channels in rat brain using [3H]batrachotoxinin-A 20-alpha-benzoate (BTX-B). Binding of [3H]BTX-B to brain sections is dependent on potentiating allosteric interactions with scorpion venom and is displaced by BTX-B (Kd approximately 200 nM), aconitine, veratridine, and phenytoin with the same rank order of potencies as described in brain synaptosomes. The maximum number of [3H]BTX-B binding sites in forebrain sections (approximately 1 pmol/mg of protein) also agrees with biochemical determinations. Autoradiographic localizations indicate that [3H]BTX-B binding sites are not restricted to cell bodies and axons but are present in synaptic zones throughout the brain. For example, a particularly dense concentration of these sites in the substantia nigra is associated with afferent terminals of the striatonigral projection. By contrast, myelinated structures possess much lower densities of binding sites. In addition, we present electrophysiological evidence that synaptic transmission, as opposed to axonal conduction, is preferentially sensitive to the action of aconitine and veratridine. Finally, the synaptic block produced by these sodium channel activators is inhibited by phenytoin and carbamazepine at therapeutic anticonvulsant concentrations. Thus, these anticonvulsants may limit seizure spread not only by affecting all-or-none conduction by axonal sodium channels but also by modulating graded aspects of synaptic transmission.\r"

  ".W": "Brief substrate deprivation resulted in high mortality of superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture, assayed 2 hr later by trypan blue exclusion. Involvement of superoxide anions was indicated by several observations. Survival was increased significantly by prior treatment that induced cells to take up superoxide dismutase. During starvation, neurons reduced nitroblue tetrazolium to form the blue precipitate formazan, and the color change was blocked in neurons preloaded with superoxide dismutase. The incidence of staining was comparable to the mortality. In many cells, brief starvation caused the appearance of fluorescence due to oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein to dichlorofluorescein, which indicates that oxidants were generated intracellularly. In some cells fluorescence was transient, as would be caused by membrane breakdown, and these cells were then shown to be dead. Superoxide generation caused by substrate deprivation may contribute importantly to cell damage in a variety of pathological conditions.\r"

A potential role for the trophic factor in brain has been detected only recently. The ability of a cell to respond to NGF is due, in part, to expression of specific receptors on the cell surface. To study tissue-specific expression of the NGF receptor gene, we have used sensitive cRNA probes for detection of NGF receptor mRNA. Our studies indicate that the receptor gene is selectively and specifically expressed in sympathetic (superior cervical) and sensory (dorsal root) ganglia in the periphery, and by the septum-basal forebrain centrally, in the neonatal rat in vivo. Moreover, examination of tissues from neonatal and adult rats reveals a marked reduction in steady-state NGF receptor mRNA levels in sensory ganglia. In contrast, a 2- to 4-fold increase was observed in the basal forebrain and in the sympathetic ganglia over the same time period. Our observations suggest that NGF receptor mRNA expression is developmentally regulated in specific areas of the nervous system in a differential fashion.\r"

  ".U": "87204270\r", 
  ".W": "In liver, thyroid hormone rapidly induces S14 mRNA, which encodes a small acidic protein. This sequence is abundantly expressed only in lipogenic tissues and is thought to have some function in fat metabolism. In the euthyroid rat, we measured 20-fold higher levels of S14 mRNA in interscapular brown adipose tissue than liver. Furthermore, whereas in liver or epididymal fat, hypothyroidism resulted in an 80% fall in S14 mRNA, in brown fat the level of this sequence increased a further 3-fold. In all three tissues, the expression of S14 mRNA correlated well with lipogenesis, as assessed by 3H2O incorporation. Physiological activation of brown fat by chronic cold exposure or cafeteria feeding increased the concentration of S14 mRNA in this tissue and again this was accompanied by a greater rate of fatty acid synthesis. Overall, in liver and white and brown adipose tissue, S14 mRNA and lipogenesis were well correlated and strongly suggest a function of the S14 protein related to fat synthesis. These studies suggest that the S14 protein and lipogenesis may be important for thyroid hormone-induced and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and that stimulation of these functions in hypothyroid brown fat is a consequence of decreased thyroid hormone-induced thermogenesis elsewhere.\r"

As a model for a somatic cell gene therapy system, cultured murine fibroblasts were transfected with a human growth hormone (hGH) fusion gene and cells from one of the resulting clonal lines were subsequently implanted into various locations in mice. Such implants synthesized and secreted hGH, which was detectable in the serum. The function of the implants depended on their location and size, and on the histocompatibility of the donor cells with their recipients. The expression of hGH could be modified by addition of regulatory effectors, and, with appropriate immunosuppression, the implants survived for more than 3 months. This approach to gene therapy, here termed \"transkaryotic implantation,\" is potentially applicable to many genetic diseases in that the transfected cell line can be extensively characterized prior to implantation, several anatomical sites are suitable for implantation, and regulated expression of the gene of therapeutic interest can be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "A new human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-4) was recently described in healthy people from Senegal. This virus has many properties in common with members of the human T-lymphotropic viruses, particularly the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, the etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but does not appear to be associated with immunodeficiency-related disorders. In the present study, serum samples were obtained from 4248 individuals from six West African countries, including Senegal, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. These samples, collected during 1985-1987, were from people categorized as healthy control, sexually active risk, and disease populations. All samples were analyzed for reactivity to HTLV-4 and HIV by radioimmunoprecipitation-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Evidence for HTLV-4 infection was found in five of the six countries. The seroprevalence varied markedly from country to country. Healthy sexually active individuals in the risk category had the highest levels of HTLV-4 infection compared to individuals in the healthy control category and the disease category, the latter including AIDS patients. The seroprevalence of HIV infection in most of these countries was quite low, although tightly associated with the rare cases of AIDS. The biology of HTLV-4 infection thus differs from that of HIV in Central Africa or the United States and Europe. The presence of these viruses and their different pathogenicities in several countries of West Africa indicate the necessity for serologic assays that will distinguish between them. Further studies of their origin and distribution as well as of their biology will be important in advancing our understanding of AIDS.\r"
